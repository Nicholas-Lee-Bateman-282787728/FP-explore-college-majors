6965675,5,B00S9U3TU6,"Easily the best movie I've seen in all of 2015. Immediately after seeing it, I ran to Barnes and Noble to buy a copy of Vera Brittain's memoir. Upon completion of the novel, I can now say with confidence that the film is very, very close to the actual happenings in Brittain's life.

The one thing I DO hate is the cover art. It's the reason why I avoided the movie tie-in when I bought the book. Testament of Youth isn't just a love story. It's the story of a woman's strength. It's the story of a sister and a daughter and a brilliant student at Oxford. It's really upsetting to me that the cover art reduces this incredible story to Vera's romance with Roland Leighton. While the romance is certainly an important aspect of the story, I found the story to be so much more than that.

But the film itself is brilliant. I keep checking back to find a DVD compatible with US DVD players and will continue to do so. I can't wait to add this film to my collection.",1440115200,41,962,4.251366120218579
6965676,5,B00S9U3TU6,"I saw this searing and deeply sad movie yesterday with two friends at a local theatre. It is a must-see for a lot of reasons. Based on the memoir by the same name of the pacifist Vera Brittain, the film is about the horrors of and effects that World War I had on one family in Great Britain. Brittain lost her financee Roland Leighton, her beloved brother Edward and two male friends to the war. She left her studies at Oxford (at a time when few young women studied there) to become a volunteer nurse. In one particularly moving scene of many, she comforts a dying German soldier because she is able to speak his language.  (Shades of the haunting lines from Y. B. Yeats poem An Irish Airman Foresees His Death: Those that I kill I do not hate.)

The film is directed by James Kent.  Alicia Vikander plays Vera-- and bears a striking resemblance to her-- Kit Harington is Roland and the actor Taron Egerton plays Edward  Brittain. The actors to a person give stunning performances, and the photography is simply beautiful.  The early peaceful rural country scenes are in sharp contrast to the bloody horrors of war that take up most of the second half of this compelling film. The person in charge of lighting is a genius.

It seems almost trite to say that the film has universal appeal. We need only say Iraq or Afghanistan to bring its message home to the U. S. And I was reminded of a dear friend of mine who tells the story of her father and his three brothers who went to fight in World War II; only her father survived. While for the most part it is husbands, sons and fathers who die or who are wounded or who return home with countless other problems, the wives, mothers  and daughters suffer too. This movie is a stark reminder of the price women also pay because of war.",1437868800,97,1782,4.398176291793313

6965701,5,B00S9U3TU6,"One of those very soundly researched and authentically produced and acted British productions, featuring Alicia Vikander in the role of Vera Brittain.

6965703,5,B00S9U3TU6,"This is an achingly beautiful, heartbreaking film about the travails of war. Based upon a best selling memoir, the viewer sees the travesty  of war and the endless grief that it brings to all, not matter what side one is on.

From the beautiful cinematography to the intelligent and articulate script, this is a worrhy film with stellar performances by the entire cast,  with Alicia Vikander a standout in her role. She is the linchpin of the film, a young women who attains her desire of attending Oxford together with her brother,  Edward, and his friend and her love interest, Roland (Kit Harrington), only to have her plans derailed by the advent of World War I.

So beautifully and thoughtfully filmed  was this movie that I found myself sobbing by its end. Anyone gung-ho about war should see this film. It will give one pause and cause one to think again. I loved this film so much that I immediately ordered the book upon which the film is based. Bravo!",1518393600,,961,4.623529411764705

6965714,5,B00S9U3TU6,"TESTAMENT OF YOUTH is a 130 minute color film taking place in the time-frame lasting from the start to the conclusion of World War I.  The first half of the film takes place in an upper-middle class home in rural England near a small river, with a few minutes at Oxford University, and several minutes in a hospital where the main character (Vera) receives nursing training.  The second half takes place in France not far from the front where the Allies are fighting the Germans.  The main character is Vera Brittain, played by Alicia Vikander.  Vera Brittain (1893-1970) is a real person who authored the book upon which this film is based.  Her book is a work of non-fiction and the characters are real.  Vikander is Swedish and she looks a bit like Keira Knightly, but not as emaciated.  Vera lives at home with her parents and brother Edward.

CLEVER AND DRAMATIC TURNS OF EVENT.  The storyline has several dramatic turns that make this a unique and compelling movie.  First, Vera is a bookworm and she wants to go to Oxford University.  She takes an entrance exam, where she is required to write something in Latin.  But she makes a mistake and writes her essay in German.  And so, the expectation is that she will not be accepted.  While at a large family picnic party, she recived a letter from Oxford and she is nervous about the contents so she hands it to her brother to open.  And so, was she accepted or rejected?  I do not reveal that here!!!

Another dramatic turn, takes place after Vera volunteers to be a nurse for the UK military in France near the front lines.  She works in a miltary hospital where her job is to clean (sponge down with water) injured soldiers lying in their cots, and to sterilize surgical equipment.  One of the soldiers is actually an injured German soldier.  The German solider is dying and Vera sympathizes and lays her hand on him.  The German soldier cries out the name of his sweetie (Clara).  He calls out, ""Clara, Clara.""  Vera (the nurse) answers, and states that she is Clara.  Moments later, the German soldier dies in his cot while Vera is still holding him.  (I am now shedding tears as I write this, because this is likely the most heartbreaking moment in all cinema).

EPISODE WITH HOMELY FAT GIRL.  After Vera returns to England with the defeat of Germany, Vera returns to college.  Viewers of the movie will wonder how Vera's outlook on life or how her personality has changed, following her first had experiences of hundreds of young men dying within an arm's reach of her.  Back in college, a homely fat girl reaches out to her and exclaims, ""I hear that you want to be a writer!""  Vera does not respond, and the viewer will likely be able to read Vera's mind, and perceive that she is thinking, ""You are you, you who does not know anything except dressing yourself, eating, and playing with your friends?""  But then the homely fat girl reveals that she had also been doing military duty in France.  In a heartbeat, Vera becomes friends with her, and the homely fat girl provides her interpretation of the previous years and the years to come.  The fat girl says, ""The two of us were surrounded by ghosts, now we have to learn how to live with them.""  (This is just another example of how profoundly clever and touching is this clever movie.  The script is so majestically wrought, it is like a Brahms piano quintet, or whatever.)

VICTORIAN ERA MORALITY.  A continuing subplot in this movie is the Victorian era morality that is imposed by Vera's aunt, Aunt Belle.  Aunt Belle is played by a fat lady, actress Joanna Scanlan.  Anyway, starting from the beginning of this movie and continuing now and then, is Aunt Belle's behavior in instructing Vera not to touch her boyfriend Roland.  Roland is played by actor Kit Harington.  Kit Harington can be recognized by his blunt nose, and he has a slight resemblance to actor Mark Ruffalo.  Anyway, whenever Vera has the opportunity or need to go on an errand of some sort, Aunt Belle insists that she have a ""chaperone.""  Also, whenever Vera has the opportunity to touch or hold hands or even kiss Roland, Aunt Belle scowls which gives Vera a not-so-subtle message.  The film begins when Vera's father gives her a piano as a gift and insists that she learn to play the piano in order to make her a more attractive woman for marriage.  But Vera gets a little angry, and tells her father that she does not want to get married ever, and that the money should have been put into her college fund and not used for a stupid piano.

CONCLUDING REMARKS.  Testament of Youth is one of the most superbly acted movies that I have ever seen.  Not one word of dialogue is out of place.  What surprised me, is that despite the fact that much of the movie takes place in the time-frame of World War I, and the fact that this movie is mostly about the taking care of the World War I wounded, the movie devotes only about ten seconds to showing celebrations in England at the war's end.  In other words, what made an impression upon me was the extreme brevity of the images of the celebrations (the goal of the cinematographer, apparently, was to prevent the celebration image from detracting from the main points of the movie).  The movie concludes at a meeting of English townsfolk in an auditorium, where the issue was whether the English should punish the Germans for creating World War II.  Vera climbs to the stage in the auditorium and gives her first public speech.  She is nervous and quiet at first, and the moderator thanks her and asks her to go back to the audience, since he assumes that she has nothing to say.  But Vera regains her composure, and remains on stage, and gives a powerful speech against taking revenge against the Germans.",1504224000,2,5740,4.570029382957885

6965725,3,B00S9U3TU6,"This is a heart-wrenching story dramatically told with an excellent cast, costumes, and settings. But to anyone who has read Vera Brittains wartime memoir, its evident that the scriptwriter was given the basic background of the story and then told to just make stuff up.  A much more accurate account of the book is the 1979 BBC mini-series by the same name. Being shorter, the movie had to leave things out, like Veras nursing service on the island of Malta. But theres no excuse for going light on the bonding that took place between her and Roland as they fell in love. They shared poetry and a love of reading and discovered that they were true soul mates before he went off to war.  Some inaccuracies also crop up, for example when Roland develops a fever as he ships out in 1916 they fear he may have the Spanish Flu, which didn't really become an epidemic until 1918.",1494979200,2,874,4.525316455696203

6965728,5,B00S9U3TU6,"I've not seen many 5 star movies lately and least of all from Hollywood but this film is something we can all be proud of. The message is violence yields nothing more but more of the same while at some point we run out of tricks we use on our brains to make it something good or noble when it clearly is neither. I wish woman would band together and reject all wars and change the face of this world and help us all think of it in human terms and the carnage it leaves behind.
The acting is as good as it gets here while all other aspects are almost as high. Well directed and beautifully scripted. It's a touching film we all should expose our children to as well.
I'm a decorated soldier and wish I had enough intellect or leadership as a young person and never fought for this land that lies about all we do while kids continue to give up their lives for those lies. We're never the same after war, and yet we never seem to tire shipping our youth out to die and suffer while a handful of cowards get filthy rich.

As a writer myself, I usually prefer to read the book before seeing a film, but in this case I had not heard of the book when I watched this film. The script is restrained and heartfelt without ever dipping into unearned emotionalism. The performances are superb, notably Alicia Vikander, but there is not a false note among any of the actors. The heartbreak and tragedy of WWI is told without sentimentality and the brutality is cleanly observed. Through the eyes of the lead female character, we get a clear picture of war and its impact upon women. The film is naturalistic and very true to the period--you feel as if you are right there in the period before during and after WWI. There is a deep sense of sadness that pervades the entire production--a sadness that is deep and multi layered and that deals with not only the time period, but the role of women, education, war love and relationship. Restrained moments carry a great deal of emotional impact. Highly recommended.",1468540800,,1091,4.628865979381444

6965763,5,B00S9U3TU6,"As being German, I didn't know about Vera Brittain at all. Maybe just like a lot of Americans.

The DVD-cover obvoiusly indicated a hopelessly romantic film, which I intended to avoid in the first place.

Only known to me was  the Swede A. Vikander and she has changed my intention. I already knew her from about 3 or 4 Scandinavian films in which she convinced me very much. In general, I notice that she usually has to suffer a great deal as an actress of mainly dramatic roles. And wow, she really can pull those off. In ToY she also has to suffer in her role, as the movie is based on the memoirs of the British pacifist and writer Vera Brittain who had to deal with the tragic loss of her loved ones in the great war.

English Director James Kent managed to translate the screenplay by J. Towhidi into really electrifying and moving ""motion-pictures"". Really I want to start by saying that this is one of the best films I've seen this year.
The story is filmed with outstanding camera, the actors, the sets and costumes are absolutely stunning. Last but not least I must mention the brilliant and never intrusive score by Max Richter. Totally wonderful!
Although I recognize I'm a lonesome voice in the desert, when it comes to the subconscious issue of  the soundtrack. But still: Hello, someone hear me?

Immediately I noticed the quite realistic British accent of native Swede Alicia Vikander, that she has trained with a Dialect coach. And Vikander plays her character Vera Brittain with so much vigor and passion that I can not do otherwise than to boast her great art of portraying that just matches her infinite natural charisma. She is not only beautiful, but so much more! Her face is totally vivid with emotion in every single scene.
Quite strange, that she is not yet a European superstar because she simply has all the prerequisites for it. Alicia Vikander truly is an Ingrid Bergman 2.0!

One could certainly still write a lot more to about this perfectly balanced movie about both the atrocities of war as well as the beauty of life, but to make it short, for everyone who reads this with interest:

Conclusion:
The film ToY has so many compelling strengths and I really couldn't possibly name any aspect of this and that to be dealt with in a better way.
A truly outstanding film and a monument for pacifism. Not to be missed.

6965772,3,B00S9U3TU6,"There is an amazing story of self-realization and courage in the true story of Vera Brittain. TESTAMENT OF YOUTH is based on her acclaimed memoir of the same name. Unfortunately, the film version does not live up to its potential to tell a story of a woman's pain, loss and growth during a time of a devastating war.

It's not the actors to blame for this disappointment. The cast includes some great actors including the lovely and talented Alicia Vikander and Kit Harrington along with classic British actors Emily Watson and Miranda Richardson. It's the story telling that loses the power and inspiration of this true story.

When we first meet Vera Brittain, she is rather annoying and unlikable as the spoiled daughter of a wealthy family. Beloved by family and friends, she seems angry at the world because of the limitations placed on her simply for being a woman. She wants more out of life than finding a man to marry. Enter dashing and handsome Roland Leighton and a chance to attend college at Oxford and her perceptions of what it means to be a woman begins to change. Sadly, WWI intervenes and the world she knows comes crashing down around her.

There is a remarkable story of a young and pampered woman for privilege who chooses an unconventional path and volunteers to be a nurse during the war. She sees the horror and devastation of a war no one really understands. The exact causes and ramifications of the war are not explained in the movie. Of course, the causes of WWI are not easy to explain in a few words. But it was a war of devastation and horror unseen up to that point in history. Soon, Vera's love Roland, her brother and several male friends are fighting on the ""front.""

Unfortunately, TESTAMENT OF YOUTH is a slow-moving film that tries to explain Vera's transformation into a pacifist and fighter for women's rights. There is not so much of a romance and love story here as there is a story in a woman seeing the horrors of war. She begins to suffer tragedy and loss and stays strong and committed. Yes, there is a wonderful and inspiring story here  that did not make its way full to the film.

I loved the cast but was disappointed in the film on so many levels. It was painfully slow moving at time. The wasted time in the film could have been used to further explain the story and Vera's transformation. I did find myself fascinated by her story and curious to learn more about Vera Brittain so I just ordered the book version of TESTAMENT OF YOUTH",1458777600,6,2486,4.550335570469799

6965777,5,B00S9U3TU6,"This is probably the best love story/war movie that I've ever seen in my life.
It is so beautifully shot and performed that nothing I can criticize about at all. Everthing is so perfect.
Most of all my best actress Alicia Vikander was so beautiful and was like an angel the whole time and well, the word cannot describe about how she appeared in this film enough. In fact, all the other actors are so very good but she is the one whom I cannot take my eyes off her the whole time.
I saw all of her films and she was always so very great. <Ex Machina><Danish Girl><The Man From U.N.C.L> but it was this movie that she was truely shined. Only looking at her face made me just so happy,
The story was simple Alicia Vikander is a different girl comparing to the others at her period. She wants to study at Oxford. There are not many girls at that time who were interested in studying at collage I think.
She met Kit Harington whom her brother brought home and she falls in love with him.
But sadly the world war 1 came out and both her brother Taron Egerton and Kit Harington enrolled for the army.
They eventually both got killed at the end.
She also temporarilly absent from school and applied for nursing for the wounded soldiers.
There she experiences a lot of things. she meets German soldiers dying with his hands leaning on her. She learns that the war and the war itself is to be blamed not the opposite country.
When all is done and she comes back to her country, she becomes an activist and a writer. She writes about what she experienced and becomes a bestseller writer.

The location was so beathtaking and each time I see the rural area with the long shot, I cannot but to think about Terrence Mellick. With the great music added, it perfectly matched with him. I mean it was even more beautiful then one of his best work.

The acting, there's nothing to be blamed. Espetically Alicia Vikander. She knew how to hold her breath. She doesn't cried till the very moment. It was not a cry cry movie after all. Even when she heard from the telephone that her boyfriend was dead from his boyfriend's mother, just one tear dropped from her eyes. She knows how to show the true grief. The true sadness is not about all tears and burst out loud. It comes from inner explosion that you cannot actually see. It eats you up from the inside that your face shows later.
She only burst up once when she found out that her brother died in her hospital camp. That moment she just couldn't help it.

The music was the best I've ever heard in years. It was so tender and well orchestrated. The director not just used the same one music again and again. Each time when something happens the music tenderly supports from the back as if to be a bodyguard. Invisible but in a very strong manner.

I thought when brother and the boyfriend died, the movie will be ended. But it kept go on.
She went back to Oxford. She still suffered from loss. And finally she stood up against war. She then becomes a writer-this part only mentioned by the subtitle at the end.

This movie was not so great at the boxoffice but will be and should be re-recognized in the future properly.
There are only a handfull of movies that can make this much impact for the audience this strong.
The other movies just bacome TV movie like quality and becomes lost in the wind.",1457827200,,3333,4.360708534621578
6965778,4,B00S9U3TU6,"We are now, as I write this review about the film Testament Of Youth based on the memoirs of the well-known 20th century British pacifist Vera Brittain, deep into the third year of the commemoration of the unmitigated slaughter of World War I. There are many ways that people have become anti-war, anti-imperialist, if not pacifists, and this film is a striking example of one young womans way to that path. It is perhaps easier to get on that anti-war path if you have been reared among the various historic religious objectors to war like the Quakers and Mennonites. Moreover it is unquestionably understandable, since this reflects my own case, if you have been in military service and have come first hand up against the inexorable demand of the killing machine that war has always been. That type conversion although not typical of the experience of the average soldier who, if he or she survives, goes home and goes back to whatever they were doing is well-documented (although the now more openly expressed experiences of post-World War II veterans from Vietnam and the various American Middle East invasions and occupations, including high rates of suicide and other social pathologies may make that going back to what they were doing statement suspect). The trail to pacifism that Ms. Brittain charted, going from her bewildered unformed pleading with her father to let her brother Edward join the army as the almost universal hysteria around entry into World War I fanned its flames, to drawing some ant-war lessons from her experiences makes this a very interesting long-term conversion experience.

One of the great, and I do not believe not arbitrary, dividing lines in modern history was the sharp difference in sensibilities before World War I and afterward. Before the war was entirely possible for anybody who would a combatant, or a non-combatant like most young women, to believe war a necessary evil to fight evil yet to be nave about what impersonal and indifferent to intentions industrial-sized war was all about. After that war when the flower of European male youth laid down their heads for a few strips of land or some ruling class demented designs that was no longer possible although many still continued to believe that the case. Ms. Brittain and her generation fell sway to that former belief. She and her brother Edward as well as his fellows at school were all under that sway as the war clouds gathered. These were all middle-class kids with expectations that they would help, if left alone, help push the British Empire forward. But the war cut off that possibility.

Here is the way Veras conversion played out on film (a look at her biography shows that her conversions and the events which gave her those insights were rather of longer duration). The precocious Vera, played in a very strong performance by Alicia Vikander, a very intelligent upper middle-class young woman from out in the hinterlands, wanted to sit for the examination for entry into Oxford. Her seemingly old-fashioned father balked until Veras loving brother Edward stepped in to persuade him to let her sit. She was accepted. And they were off. Except the damn war got in the way in all kinds of ways as the question of doing ones duty for ones country ate at Edward and his friends. One of those friends, Roland, along the way becoming very smitten by Vera. And eventually she him. The long and short of it was all the young men in her life were off to the military, none forced to go but committed to do the right thing.

The bulk of the rest of the film deals with the intertwined fates of the young men and Veras own personally patriotic attempts to do her duty-for her young male compatriots. Rather than completing her studies at Oxford she volunteered for the nursing corps-for the duration including a stint at the front in France. From there it is a case of all the young men she was involved with laying down their heads on various fronts. Roland, at home on furlough, who had previously been extremely attentive to Vera had come back a changed man. Before he returned to the front under her nurturing they decide to get married the next time he was home on leave. There would be no next time. Her brothers friends share a similar fate and eventually her sweet Edward after being saved by her at her nursing station near the front goes back on duty. Only to be one more causality in the daily newspaper and one more black-etched telegraph message from the War Office to the family.

As the film ends (as it had begun) Vera is troubled by the euphoria of the crowds on Armistice Day 1918. Having seen the flower of her countrys (and Germanys) youth fall under the barb-wired on the fronts and having lost her companions she happened on a meeting discussing what should become of the Germans who started the war. She makes an impassioned and person speech before that essentially hostile crowd. And the rest is history. Yes, a testament to youth- and the folly of war. If we could ever learn that lesson without all the hell she had to go through. See this one, please.",1457827200,,5086,4.737020316027088

6965790,4,B00S9U3TU6,"I have to judge this film on its own merits, as I have not read the memoir upon which it is based.  So no comments on the accuracy/faithfulness/thoroughness of the adaptation.  However, one fault of the movie is that it FEELS like a lot has been left out.  We are asked to take some big jumps in time...we jump from high point to high point...but not taking the time to show less ""dramatic"" moments in the lives of the characters makes it a little harder to feel we know these people.

We meet young Vera Brittain just months before the start of WWI.  She comes from what seems to be a middle class family...enough money to have some servants, but not enough to consider paying for their smart daughter to go to Oxford for college.  She's self-centered and focused on her studies...not interested too much in the frivolities of the men around her, including her beloved brother and his friends.  Yet sparks fly (despite her desire to avoid such complications) with young and handsome Kit Harrington (best known as Jon Snow in GAME OF THRONES...in this film, he has no beard and is almost unrecognizable as a result).  He encourages her studies and writings.  They are both hoping to be Oxford bound.  The viewer must presume that these folks are all thus just out of high school (or the equivalent), yet they all look far too old to just now be thinking about college.  Ah well.

College is interrupted by the start of the war, and the men in Vera's life are drawn into the conflict.  She feels a need to serve (never fully explained), and becomes a nurse, first in England and then near the front.  The men in her life move in and out of the story...but this is truly the story of Vera.  Fortunately, because the script doesn't always give us all we need, we are in the hands of emerging star Alicia Vikander.  (DANISH GIRL, EX MACHINA)  Vikander is never less than interesting...her characters wears her emotions so clearly on her face, and we see her many inner conflicts played out so clearly on that canvas.  Although I would say her performance in DANISH GIRL brings even more shades and subtlties, she still commands the screen.

Part of that command comes from the fact that she is surrounded by some weak performances, and thus jumps even more clearly to the lead.  Kit Harrington has some charm, but really not a lot of depth.  And as Vera's parents, Emily Watson is given NOTHING to do but look dowdy (such a waste of a great actress) and Dominic West once again proves that he is a supremely over-rated actor...from his terrible Baltimore accent in THE WIRE to his ridiculous little role in 300, West's appeal is completely lost on me.  Taron Egerton, as Vera's brother, fares a bit better, and has the most interesting character arc.

It sounds like I'm mostly complaining, but now let me state that despite some noteworthy weaknesses, the drama inherent in this subject matter is quite compelling and the film is still quite affecting.  WWI and the truly horrific conditions the soldiers endured, coupled with the primitive medical care they received, make from gripping stuff.  With Vikander's strong performance anchoring everything, we see through her eyes the horror she sees.  The film features some lovely cinematography, especially in the opening scenes, so we see quite starkly the contrast between the beauty of a peaceful world and the ugliness of a world at war.  The film is low budget, so there are no real battle sequences...Vera was never in a battle, so how could we see one?  This is not a movie that pretends to be telling the history of WWI.  It is a film that shows the brutality and senselessness and randomness and sadness of war.  While not exactly charting new territory, TESTAMENT OF YOUTH brings its own perspective on that familiar territory, and that's enough to make the film very worthwhile.",1454371200,2,3835,4.6890881913303435
6965791,5,B00S9U3TU6,"Ive been gushing for the past year about Swedish actress Alicia Vikander who I had seen early in 2015 in Ex Machina, which turned out to be my favorite film of the year.  I caught up with a few of her other films as well including The Man from U.N.C.L.E, Anna Karenina, and her Oscar nominated performance in The Danish Girl.

In this classic memoir by Vera Brittain, set to film for the first time (as near as I can determine), Ms. Vikander may have given her best performance yet.  Brittain (Vikander) is a young English woman intent on getting into Oxford, like her brother Edward (Taron Egerton, Kingsman: The Secret Service).  The mores in 1914 England suggests she is better off training to be a good wife.  Early on she is upset with her father (Dominic West) when he buys her a grand piano rather than tuition to the university.  Edward and his good friend and classmate, Roland (Kit Harington, Pompeii) encourage Vera to pursue her dream to be a writer.  She is smitten with Roland.  Not only is he smart, attractive, and has his own plans to write but he is also supportive of her furthering her education.

Vera is surprisingly admitted to Oxford (Sommerville College) even after not doing well on her Latin translations.  An admitting officer (Miranda Richardson) sees something in her.  Things all change when war breaks out.  Edward wants to enlist but his father is against it.  Vera makes a case that Edward should be allowed to join the patriotic cause.  A decision she will always regret.  Other friends of Edwards join as well including Roland.  As the war becomes much longer than anticipated, Vera feel she must do something more directly that will help.  She becomes a nurse and works close to the front.  Her first assignment is caring for wounded German officers.  She finds they are not much different than the British boys.

During leave, Roland is experiencing symptoms of battle fatigue but Vera pulls him out of his depression.  They become engaged.  The film has many opportunities to become a traditional war movie with numerous scenes of backstory romance, melancholia and repetition.  But director James Kent working with Juliette Towhidis screenplay keep the story focused on Veras first person perspective.  It is hard to imagine anyone but Vikander in the role.  Shes in nearly every scene, adopts an English accent and plays the role to the hilt.  Her emotions are played out with her facial expressions, her eyes and her gestures.  Pay attention to how she moves her hands.  How she caresses a flower, a face or a battle wound.  Shes a pleasure to watch.

Vera Brittains first-hand experience, immersed in the field of battle, changes her in measurable ways.  She transitions from student to nurse to student to one of the leading pacifists of her time.  The film is emotional, intelligent and another showcase for Ms. Vikander.  Highly recommended.

The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p video resolution and the original 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  While the video images are not of demo quality, there is little to complain about.  My only real nit to pick are the black levels which were more dark grey than black.  I also spotted a time or two where the skin-tones seemed inconsistent.  It really is no big deal and most viewers won't notice.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 lossless track.  It is also very good.  There aren't a lot of battlefield scenes which tend to wake up the surrounds.  Most of the film is dialog centric and that is well done.  Again, my only complaint is that the soundstage seems a bit inconsistent.  There are a host of subtitle options available in addition to the usual English (SDH), French and Spanish.  Extras include an audio commentary with Harington and director Kent, a behind the scenes piece, some deleted scenes, a trailer and additional Sony previews.",1454025600,3,3845,4.803053435114504

6965809,5,B00S9U3TU6,"Vera Brittains pacifist autobiography is brought to the screen by Juliette Towhidi, directed by James Kent, and acted by a superb cast of some of Englands finest actors  both experienced and fresh. The result is a graphic depiction of the horrors of World War I (which becomes all wars for those of us who have served), the agonies of losing loved ones on the battlefield, the sustenance of hope in the face of the unimaginable, and the pain and joy of youth becoming adults  somehow very well connected in this visually stunning and moving film.

We are in England before the outbreak of WW I observing the very bright and headstrong pre-suffragette Vera Brittain (a radiant and sensitive Alicia Vikander) focus her attention on getting into Oxford in a period when women had to struggle much harder than men to gain an advanced education. We also become involved with the family (father Dominic West, mother Emily Watson, and bother Edward Taron Egerton) as well as colleagues Victor (Colin Morgan) and new paramour Roland Leighton (Kit Harrington). Vera passes entrance exams but her triumph at being accepted into Oxford is tarnished by the outbreak of WW I and the gradual loss of her lover, friends, and bother to the deaths on the battlegrounds of France. She leaves Oxford, becomes a volunteer nurse and singularly survives the war  but without the men of her life whom she cherishes.

The bleak and senseless monster  war  with whom we still struggle daily is raw and bitterly cruel and the manner in which it is depicted rings of Wilfred Owenss poetic descriptions. Some will say it is a sanguine film: those who have lived through such times will ache that we have yet to learn that war is not a solution. Highly recommended for the sensitive and for those who need to be sensitized. Grady Harp, December 15",1451001600,3,1818,4.789137380191693

6965839,5,B00S9U3TU6,"This powerful movie based on The Memoir of Vera Brittain; Remembrance of a lost generation, brings forward the agonizing story of a time in history when carefree family life was severely threatened. It became ominous as World War 1 loomed on the horizon. Vera Brittains account actually opens in November 1918, on Armistice Day, as the people are celebrating the war's end. Vera (Swedish actress - Alicia Vikander) is dazed as she pushes through the massive crowd holding their dear ones as they return from the ravages she has seen first-hand. From this point, we go back four years to the happier time in her life when she was younger, full of ambition to go to Oxford and study to be a writer while being self-taught. She is adamant about never wanting a man supporting her as she would rather do this for herself. Her father (Dominic West) and mother (Emily Watson) want her to marry someday, although Vera's focus is on learning and spending free time with her brother, Edward (Taron Egerton) along with friends, Victor (Colin Morgan) and Roland Leighton (Kit Harington), an aspiring writer and poet of whom she has started to admire in the prewar days having a more whimsical feel.

Vera goes to Oxford to take the examination for admission and eventually she does get accepted. By this time, she and Roland, who is also an Oxfordian, have developed a loving relationship and are anxious to be together as he tells her, When were at Oxford, well be able to see each other every day. War, although, is crowding the newspapers headlines and causing widespread panic throughout the country while the young men in Great Britain are feeling the call of duty. Roland signs himself up first after pleading with Vera for her understanding with the knowledge that it will be over in a short time. First Roland, then Victor and next to follow is her younger brother, Edward. Vera and Edward believe that the time away will only be until Christmas time. When on a prior leave of absence, her dear Roland proposes, asking to marry her on that upcoming Christmas and it goes over quite well to an excited and agreeable Vera. In reality, though, it is a glacially-paced four years of completely tortuous devastation.

Now with her beloved Roland away fighting, along with her well-loved brother and friends, Vera feels compelled that she is needed elsewhere instead of with her studies. Daily the women behind in Britain are scrambling to look through the printed lists of the men who have fallen in combat and there are just so many. Her all-consuming need is to assist with the horrible carnage alongside the wounded soldiers while offering her help in any way she might. She joins in with the nursing aid inside the field hospitals caring for the wounded men in a decision to remain closer somehow to her loved ones while helping the fallen.  She leaves to go to France in 1917 to even care for the German mortally, wounded soldiers. For Vera, it does not matter where they are from, it is all about what she may be able to help them all with.

She personally suffers extensive tragedies while appearing to be on autopilot at times. Vera keeps working onto exhaustion. This screenplay by Juliette Towhidi puts the bulk of concentration on the womens point of view. This chilling look, especially from the inside of the field hospitals run by the women taking care of the most horrendous of situations, is just as heart-wrenching, if not more so, than the battle scenes. Director James Kent pulls no punches while showing  the most extreme suffering along with the never-ending parade of wounded and dying men. Developed with the finest cinematography one could possibly ask for (Rob Hardy) along with a daunting soundtrack by Max Richter. A 'do not miss' movie that truly educated me about World War 1. What does become of the men she loves? I will leave all this within this strikingly thorough narrative of Veras own accounting. Her pleading speech as she poured her heart out at the end flattened me... completely. Testament of Youth was heralded as the voice of a generation and is still read today. Veras tremendous courage and selfless spirit along with her loving kindness filled my own heart to overflowing through tear filled eyes with each viewing.",1448323200,12,4253,4.796725784447476

6965860,4,B00S9U3TU6,"This film is wonderfully, written, acted, and filmed in a way that only British filmmakers seem capable of doing these days. The word ""testament"" in its title, and in that of the memoir from which it is derived, is truly appropriate. Over 25% of the British male population between the ages of 17 and 35 were either killed or wounded in this war and those devastating losses haunt Great Britain to this day, as do those of all the nations of Europe who fought in this tragic and pointless conflict. The numbing loss in this film's story is a very personal one for the lead character, but it is one that we, the viewer, can multiply by millions and get a true sense of the global catastrophe that was the First World War. Perhaps worst of, however, is that, as we watch this story unfold, we are reminded that the war's only true legacy was to lay the groundwork for another conflict to come, one that was even worse.",1447545600,,916,4.42603550295858

6965876,1,B00S9U3TU6,"Ostensibly, this was the story about a community of young intellectuals and their reaction to the first instance of global, total war. Sadly, no ideas were harmed in the making of this movie. Ideas and at times the war itself are only the background for a pedestrian story of young love. A generation decimated by war is really too large an event to hide behind these two people who are depicted as not much more interesting than most graduating high school seniors.
This movie has people spouting the appropriate platitudes, but never gets at the specific truth beneath the general tragedy of the war. I loved seeing the period clothing and places. Those views began to give a feeling for England a century ago, but factual mistakes tainted even that small enjoyment. For example, at one point shortly after the war begins, the chaperon is talking about the ""Spanish Flu"". Unfortunately, from that character's perspective the Spanish Flu would have been four years in her future. The war begins for Britain in 1914. The Spanish flu shows up in 1918. It's just a mistake of a few years, but during those years millions die in WW1 which is ostensibly why the movie was made. Details like that matter in stories that choose to approach large historical events from the point of view of a small story about the experiences of one young woman. It would have been helpful to establish the place and time by including in passing any of the many possible historical figures, besides our set of lovers - John Maynard Keynes, George Mallory, Virginia Woolf and sundry other members of the Bloomsbury Group might have been knocking around Cambridge at the time these people were coming into their intellectual majority. We would have to actually see the historical figures, but someone might mention some of the debates or ideas with which they were concerned. Leaving this context out is a little like telling a story set in the 1960s about a young woman from Liverpool who is enamored of rock and roll without mentioning the Beatles

This movie had a great opportunity to create a psychological portrait of the people of the time. Sadly, there was very little evidence that the movie makers respected the subject matter enough to have a detailed understanding of the ideas that bright young people were interested in at the time.",1447027200,8,2321,4.81704260651629

After this first viewing I said that it was one of the very best movies I'd EVER seen----and I've seen more than my share.  I love strong female characters with great inner strength and assertiveness, as well as heart and compassion, but with enough maturity and intelligence to use some restraint when appropriate in dealing with other humans.  Alicia Vikander's portrayal of Vera Brittain in Testament of Youth is in the same league as Keira Knightly's Elizabeth Bennett in Pride & Prejudice, and Madeleine Stowe's Cora Munro in Last of the Mohicans.  In fact the Vikander/Brittain character may be the strongest and most admirable of the three----which is precisely why I see Testament of Youth as one of the best movies I've ever seen.",1446854400,,806,4.904411764705882

Whoever made the movie was brilliant. Added that touch of loving each other so much that they married before he went to war. I agree with her about war. It is a useless and a waste of humanity. We are not made as barbarians, but as humans who have the ability to fix our differences or to accept others as they are. World War II was needed because of what Germany was doing to the Jews. We fight for others rights to be who they are and what they believe.",1446854400,,721,4.013888888888889
6965886,5,B00S9U3TU6,"A Testament of Youth was a deeply moving movie that frankly, if you have any heart at all, will rip your emotions to shreds.  Those of us who have not experienced the horrors or the loss of love ones in wars might come away unmoved or bored by this movie.  However, when I recently read this week that many young English citizens know very little about the World War I, it becomes a sad testament to today's youth.  We should remind ourselves of the horrors of war as a deterrent, however, humanity has never taken the message seriously.

Clearly the attitudes of the youths in the early 20th century compared to those in the 21st century are vastly different.  As they left for the fields of France or wherever they served, they certainly had no comprehension of what they would face in the trenches.  Seventeen million people perished in this war, and it's not just the brave men who fought.  It's a sad commentary that the best of youth perished as this movie dramatically shows.  What becomes of those who were left behind such as lovers, wives, mothers, fathers, and friends, is no less devastating as unbearable grief results.  I have distant English cousins who perished in the great war.  Watching this movie brings to mind their sacrifice and the sorrow my ancestors must have felt when that terrible news arrived of their deaths.

Perhaps the movie itself is not the Oscar-type, but it is the reality type.  It's well acted, though may be somewhat slow as the story progresses into the war.  If you don't like to watch the horror of broken bodies, blood, death, and suffering, then you may find some scenes difficult.  If anything, this movie is indeed a testament of youth, loyalty, bravery, and a will to continue living so that the memory of those who died continues to live as well.

I have not read Brittain's memoirs so cannot compare, but the movie did a great job at capturing the emotion that comes with the tragedies of lost love and lost youth. The acting, scenery, and filming are lovely and draws the viewers in with the intensity. I have heard some say it is slow-moving and sometimes dragged out, yet I think the 2 hrs. and 9 min. went by quickly. The slow-moving was necessary, I feel, to capture the intricacies of each scene.

I recommend to history buffs or those who want to learn more about that sad time in history.

I only gave it 4 stars though, because Kit Harington was Jon Snow again without the beard, and there was a weird vibe between him and heroine that made for a lack of chemistry between 2 people who were supposed to be in love. Her  or the director's interpretation of Vera is like a bull in a china shop. Never has such a pretty actress ever scowled so much. And Winifred Holtby was just a blip in this movie compared to the very real and important influence she played in all of the Testament books being written, not just the first one.",1445817600,2,553,4.266666666666667
6965934,4,B00S9U3TU6,"We need every indictment of war we can get and this is a good one. As for Graves Vine Voice's poor review its author seems ignorant of the ridiculous assumptions and expectations women had to put up with during this era. Graves says, "" Even as a young woman she seems to be in a perpetual funk about this thing or that thing so as her world is torn apart by war, it just seems that she merely switches the target of her ire from one thing to another rather than discovering new levels of herself."" So Graves reduces Vera's justified, intelligent  dissatisfaction, to funk, to petulance. Ridiculous. The actress that plays Vera does an excellent job depicting the courage, determination and ability to discover all kinds of things about herself. She discovers she can work hard and overcome the prejudice that kept so many women out of Oxford, then later that she can give up that very education she's wanted more than anything. After that, she finds the incredible fortitude to nurse not only Englishmen but Germans too, and most importantly, she rises above conventions about the rectitude of war. This is not a great film but it is an important one and well worth the time. And Graves is wrong about another thing. I could name at least three other incidents in which Vera is depicted as enjoying moments in life besides the one Graves claims stands alone. But just watch the film and see for yourself.",1445731200,,1404,4.63855421686747

6965951,4,B00S9U3TU6,"Testament of Youth is based on a 1933 memoir by Vera Brittain about coming of age during World War I, one of the few books to address the war from a female point of view. In flashbacks from Armistice Day celebrations in 1918, the British film depicts teenage Vera (Alicia Vikander) trying to convince her father (Dominic West) to let her attend Oxford University. She is courted by aspiring poet Roland Leighton (Kit Harrington), volunteers as a nurse when hostilities in Europe break out, and witnesses, close-up, the horrors of war.

Roland is the first to enlist, followed by his best friend, Victor (Colin Morgan), and Veras younger brother Edward (Taron Egerton, Kingsman: The Secret Service). They all believe the conflict will be so short-lived that they will be home for Christmas. But the war lasts four years, during which Vera develops from schoolgirl to frontline nurse to powerful anti-war voice. With the backdrop of a global war, the film takes on a noble air despite showing no battle scenes. Director James Kent focuses on the home front and field hospitals to show how everyday life in England was dictated by the war and the toll on its young men. Set during the same period as Downton Abbey, the film is beautifully shot.

Ms. Vikander convincingly portrays young Veras journey from idealistic hopes and dreams to the edge of despair and back again. The Swedish actress is believable as an English girl with a forceful conscience, intelligence, and purpose. Veras humanity and concern for the war-wounded extends to German soldiers, an unpopular stand in a country rife with anti-German sentiment. An early feminist before there was such a term, Vera is deeply affected by terrible personal losses and takes up the cause of pacifism as her way to decry the tragedy of war.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include deleted scenes, commentary with Kit Harrington and director James Kent, behind-the-scenes making-of featurette, and theatrical trailer.",1445040000,29,1973,5.04601226993865
6965952,5,B00S9U3TU6,"This is a brilliant film and very relevant in today's world when Western nations are becoming more and more militarily interventionist in Asia, waging war in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria. At its core, it is an anti-war, pacifist and feminist film, bringing out the heart-wrenching sadness of young lives being sacrificed on the battlefront and the deep scars these killings leave in the surviving members of the family. It portrays the hearts of young women losing their lovers or fianc or husbands and parents losing their sons.  It makes us confront the gory sight of maimed human bodies, blood-soaked wounds and excruciating pain. It brings out powerfully the pacifist message of the protagonist, Vera Brittain, unmasking the truth behind all this eulogizing of War as something that involves noble and painless death, as a sacred duty and as a necessary evil. Instead we see that war is often full of lies and vacuous words liberally doused with intense mental and physical agony. As Vera argues, we need to step back and get off this 'blood-thirsty treadmill of revenge' by seeing that there is little difference between the German soldier and the English soldier who fought against one another in the First World War. I found this a profoundly moving film and its message brought to my memory another old anti-war film of Sophia Loren, 'Two Women', which looks at the brutality of war, through the lens of two young women, who get raped by Allied Moroccan soldiers at the end of the Second World war. I think we need more and more of this pacifist message in today's frenzy of resorting to war to solve our problems.

The film is based on the memoirs of Vera Brittain, written in 1933, well after the end of the First World War,  recollecting her tragic personal experiences during the War. She was the daughter of Thomas Brittain, a well-to-do paper mill owner in central England. The film opens with the end of the war in 1918, Armistice Day, as Vera jostles through the ecstatic crowds towards a church. Then, we are taken back through a flashback to early 1914, to the innocent days when Vera, her beloved brother Edward and their friend Victor were enjoying a swim in a lake in Buxton. There is a hint that Victor is in love with Vera but perhaps too shy to make a mention of it. Vera, just twenty-one years old, was already aiming for studying in Oxford and becoming a writer rather than just living in rural Buxton and getting married, like all women were meant to do in the early twentieth century. Her parents could not fathom as to why she would want to go to college and her father worries that she won't find a suitable husband if she goes off to Oxford. Young Edward backs his sister strongly and Vera goes on to enroll in Somerville college, Oxford to study English.

Vera falls in love with Edward's friend Roland, a poet and writer as well. However, war clouds gather in Europe as the Archduke of Ferdinand gets murdered in Sarajevo setting in motion the first world war. Edward, Victor and Roland sign up for war duty and get sent to the French front, all under the illusion that war would be heroic, short and quick. Even Vera believes so and persuades her father , who was reluctant to send young Edward to the front, to let him go as it would be hard for Edward to face the community when all his friends enlist and go to the front as well . Vera goes to Oxford but eventually feels the pull of duty and signs up to become a nurse in the hospital behind the front lines, leaving Oxford. The rest of the film is told through Vera's experience as a nurse at the front, the terrible conditions in the trench, the devastation and destruction amidst all the pain and suffering of the thousands of severely injured men, not just English soldiers but German captives as well. Edward, Victor and Roland also suffer the severe consequences of combat at the front. Vera, during the course of her duties as a nurse,  in spite of suffering the impact of war on her own life,  is moved by the final heart-rending agonies of a dying German soldier, as she provides care for him. She says  after the end of the war recalling this incident as a crucial factor in turning her into a pacifist. The movie ends with the return of Vera to the church on Armistice day.

Alicia Vikander, the Swedish actress, as Vera, is brilliant as the young Englishwoman, portraying courage, strength, humanity, love and resilience in the face of daunting tragedy. The photography and the costumes of the era add great authenticity to the film. The screenplay is also powerful even though I don't know how exactly it reflects Vera's own words, as I have not read the book. It is a rather sad film but there is no doubt that this is a must-see one.",1443484800,5,4742,4.59692671394799
