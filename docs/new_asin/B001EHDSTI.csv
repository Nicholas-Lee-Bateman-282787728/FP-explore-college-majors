3554557,4,B001EHDSTI,We love Ned's Declassified at our house and wish someone would make DVD's all of the shows.,1268870400,,91,4.411764705882353
3554558,5,B001EHDSTI,"This will not play on a newer computer.  It would not play on my Vista machine with either my LG DVD writer or my Sony Blu-Ray player, due to the hardware anti-copy provisions.  It will play on my XP machine, but only in my older DVD player, not my LG DVD burner.  The DVD player is old enough to not have those damned restrictions.
NOTE: I finally switched my older machine to Ubuntu Linux, with the same results.
The video quality is excellent, equal to commercial DVDs.  The disk art and packaging are as good as commercial DVDs as well.  And the show itself is great, very funny and good-natured. Well worth buying, I hope enough people do that Amazon releases the rest of the episodes.",1232755200,2,690,4.444444444444445
3554559,5,B001EHDSTI,"With the deal struck between Nickelodeon and Amazon, we finnaly have various titles being released that I thought we would never see. Thank you Amazon! Now if only you could strike the same deal with Buena Vista Home Entertainment and get titles like X-Men, Spiderman, MMPR, and Digimon in Region 1 boxsets. I would gladly pay my hard earned money for titles like that.",1222819200,,369,4.78125
3554560,5,B001EHDSTI,"I am 40 yrs. old and I love this show. It reminds me of a combination of Warner Bros. cartoons, old slapstick and screwball comedies. It's so good to see this show finally get the dvd treatment. The episodes included are #5-13 of the first season which are 1)Crushes/Dances 2)Sick Days/Spelling Bees 3)Rumors/Photo Day 4)Elections/Talent Shows 5)Computer Lab/Backpacks 6)Notes(which isn't listed on the back)/Best Friends 7)Day Dreaming/Gym 8)Cheaters/Bullies & 9)Emergency Drills/Late Bus. The transfers are beautiful and as good as could be hoped for. I know a lot of people will not want to buy this because it's not a complete season. Since they are only producing this on demand it is vitally important to purchase and let Amazon know that Ned's Declassified is wanted and should be released completely. The more they sell, the more likely they will be willing to release the rest.",1222646400,15,886,5.117241379310345

3554624,5,B001EHDSTI,"My 8 year old grandson started watching this series about 1 year ago on Roku, but it was discontinued.
He's happy to be watching the show again.  The humor is rather young for today's Middle Schooler.
My 11 year old granddaughter doesn't like it because it's ""dumb"" and she's a sixth grader.
I'm 62 and I like it because it shows all the things that can happen at school and how to handle situations in a positive way.
I'm sure our grandson is learning!",1388188800,2,453,4.392857142857143

3554627,5,B001EHDSTI,This show is for everyone. It relates to a preteen to adults. It makes lot of old references a 80s /90s kid can relate to. Also this is like old nickelodeon. I like it and its always funny plus their is always a life lesson to be heard.,1380585600,,236,3.9375

3554639,5,B001EHDSTI,A collection of 1/2 hourish shows that has a cast of middle school kids you could find in a real school.  Family friendly. No drug references. No sexual references.  A wonderfully upbeat show filled with silliness.,1377129600,3,214,4.916666666666667

3554645,5,B001EHDSTI,"Written with affecting humor tending toward the madcap, Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide nevertheless centers each half-episode around a real issue that is pertinent to children of middle-school age--and as rarely happens in kids' television, the lessons here might actually *help* your kid(s) navigate life.
While the action is zany, care is taken in the writing to present the students as whole people; and beyond the direct-to-camera tips given out copiously by Ned in each episode for such minor horrors as having something stuck in your teeth or the best placement for a locker, there are invaluable strategies for more serious pitfalls such as bullying, poor self-image, academic dishonesty, and how to deal sensitively with a friend's tragedy.  The plot of each episode is more or less an illustration of each ""survival tip.""
It is TV for kids of a certain age, and therefore parents are largely absent in person, although their presence is felt: the kids get themselves into and out of trouble, as responsible people should, but there is no mistake that they are subject to rules at home.  The school faculty, while not caricatured as inept, is certainly a bit on the clueless side (as is the entire adult population in a middle-schooler's reckoning!), but there is wisdom there, too.
Middle school is a fraught time for developing humans, with new challenges and risks, and with decisions that for the first time in your life may affect the *rest* of your life.  It is the time when we begin to fine-tune important distinctions between, for instance, dignity vs. pride, ambition vs. greed, discipline vs. obsession, and embarrassment vs. shame.  In short, it's when we start the business of growing up.  People--kids and adults alike--could do worse than seeing other confused and imperfect humans making it through, sometimes with grace and sometimes by the skin of their teeth, but always with a laugh and, in the end, as people who, by facing the music, can face the next day without shame ...even if they *are* a little embarrassed.",1326931200,5,2053,5.026470588235294
3554646,5,B001EHDSTI,"Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide was possibly the best show to ever air on Nick.  Not only was the show hilarious, but it was really clean too; a show everyone in the family will love.  The humor is fast-paced and over the top like a rated G version of Scrubs.  And if you like Big Time Rush (another Nick show from creator Scott Fellows) you will love Ned's Declassified.  It has exactly the same kind of humor, timing, and crazy characters (and Daran Norris has supporting roles on both shows).

It is such a shame that the show ended after only three seasons, but then, the show takes place in a middle school, which usually only lasts three years before moving on to high school.  Furthermore, it is also a shame that they haven't released the full seasons in the US where the show was actually made, yet they were released in Canada and some European countries.

Fortunately, Amazon has private vendors whom you can buy the Canadian, full-seasons from, which is what I did.  You can also buy ""Best of"" DVD sets from Amazon for seasons 1 & 2 that were released in the US, but nothing on season three has been released anywhere yet except for the series finale, ""Special Field Trip Edition"" (also released in the US).

So here's hoping that Season 3 will soon be released in full in the US very soon.",1304121600,4,1311,4.4978902953586495
3554647,5,B001EHDSTI,"Ned's is a great show that I highly recommend to other families.  In a lot of Nick and Disney teen shows the ""comedy"" is merely kids being rude to each other in witty dialogue.  Not so with Ned's Declassified.  It is smart and funny, the writing is creative and the actors give it 100%.  Parents and kids will share 3 hours of laughter.  This is an under-appreciated show and well worth the money!  And the product info is wrong: This set is 217 minutes, not 120.  So don't think that you aren't getting much for your money.  Buy it!  You'll love it!",1294704000,2,550,4.313725490196078
3554648,5,B001EHDSTI,"Great news!  The COMPLETE First Season of Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide is now available on DVD!
