7266326,4,B00YT8SFR4,"Insidious Chapter 3, the latest installment of the highly acclaimed Insidious horror movies is, in my view, on par with the first Insidious movie, and leagues beyond the mediocre second installment Insidious Chapter 2. I don't know if it's because it was directed by Leigh Whannell, this film is actually his directorial debut by the way, which was really shocking for me to hear. It was almost as shocking as the movie itself, which is a genuine rarity among third installments and prequels, both for how genuinely terrifying and touching it is, but also how well it was written, acted, and directed. But enough about all that, the real star of the show wasn't Stephanie Scott, who played the grieving daughter Quinn, but Lin Shaye reprising her role as Elise Rainer. While she had her moments in the first two movies, both alive and as a ghost herself, in this movie, which takes place before the other two, she manages to outshine all of the other actors and actresses, most of whom did quite well themselves, just not on her level. In this film she has semi-retired from her work as a psychic medium, and in the opening scene is visited by Quinn, who asks her to do a reading, in order to connect with her dearly deceased mother. She tries but what she manages to contact isn't her mother, but some other, demonic entity on par with the Darth Maul demon in the first movie.
She then tells her she can't help her and warns her as well that when you try to contact one deceased spirit you inadvertently end up contacting all of them. Quinn leaves downhearted, not realizing exactly what's in store for her in the coming days. While this film does have a ton of genuine jump scares, not false ones by the way, it also has several quieter moments that are nevertheless filled with dread and tension to the point it got overwhelming for me watching it nearly alone in the movie theater. Luckily later on, when the two ""ghostbusters"" showed up and there was some comic relief, it was a breathe of fresh air. Nevertheless, despite Quinn and her family dilemma being the focus of the film, it's Elise and her moral dilemma of sorts that provides the ""heart"" of the film, as it shows her wanting to move on from her past as a psychic, grieving the untimely death of her husband, and trying to find her way among the world of the living, where she seems less at home then among the world of the dead. It chronicles her rise from a frightened tortured soul to a strong, kick-ass, ghost hunter who refused to back down when faced with the sinister forces trying to possess Quinn and take her down into the darkness with them.
Elise realizes she has something they don't, she's alive, and much, much stronger than she thinks she is. One thing that this film provides that the others really did not was a focus on grief and loss and how people react to losing people they loved and cherished, both for Quinn and Elise, there was a very interesting dynamic between them as well. It's also an origin story of sorts, where Elise first meets up with the ghost hunting team shown in the first and second movies. Towards the end of the movie it did lessen in quality and became almost comedic with the introduction of the two ghost hunters, but overall, it was an awesome film, a little bit clichd and formulaic at some points yes, but still an amazing film, standing on it's own, or with the other two Insidious movies. I highly suggest you check it out!",1433980800,33,3439,4.521669341894061
7266327,4,B00YT8SFR4,"Nine Things About the Movie Insidious Chapter 3

1.  Leigh Wannell wrote the first two Insidious movies. He wrote and directed (and acted in) this one.

2.  This one does not start where Chapter 2 left off. Chapter 2 was left hanging. Instead, this movie is a prequel to both of the previous films. It's about a new family, but they have the usual Insdious problems: an evil spirit has attached itself to a kid and wants her soul. Elise the psychic has to go into The Further to save her, blah blah blah. Its kind of Chapter 1 all over again.

3.  Whannell does his usual clever job of connecting stories. As the movie picks up, it gradually widens its scope until you see how its not really a stand-alone film. It connects to both of the other chapters.

4.  In this day and age, everybody should know not to look under beds in the middle of the night. If you do that, you deserve what happens to you.

5.  Elise is really the heart of this film. Shes kind of a badass.

6.  One of the great things about this series is that the demons are fairly original and actually creepy. Chapter 1 had the Lipstick-Face Demon (yes, thats what it was called), Chapter 2 had the Bride in Black, and Chapter 3 has the Demon That Cant Breathe.

7.  Like the other two movies, this one has some legitimately unsettling scenes and some effective jump scares. Its not original enough to actually sustain the fear, but it hits most of the marks.

8. The climax is kind of dumb, cheesy and predictable. I was unimpressed.

9. This movie doesnt have as much cleverness as the other two, and weve already seen the scary places  twice. So it doesnt hold up quite as well as it could have. But its a decent flick, and it was fun to see the various characters and demons all showing up for this movie. Fans of the series will find it worth seeing.",1433721600,4,1823,4.299120234604105
7266328,3,B00YT8SFR4,"The four-year-old Insidious franchise continues with an uneven, but still entertaining and, at times, very creepy third entry.  A prequel set a few years before the events of the prior films, the storyline turns on high-school student Quinn (Stefanie Scott), whose bid to contact the spirit of her deceased mother instead attracts the attention of a dangerous supernatural entity:  an emaciated, slithering demon whose presence is announced by labored breathing and oily footprints.  She and her bewildered father, played rather blandly by Dermot Mulroney, turn to franchise mainstay Elise (Lin Shaye) for aid, though she is reluctant to use her psychic power after the suicide of her husband and several foreboding encounters with another franchise mainstay, the spirit of a murderous woman in a sable bridal gown (or rather a man in drag if I my memory of Insidious: Chapter 2 serves).

Though he is still credited as a producer and even has a brief cameo in the first act, James Wan is replaced here as director by frequent collaborator Leigh Whannell, the writer of the prior Insidious films and a consistent member of the ensemble cast as one-half of a comic-relief ghost-hunting duo.  This is Whannell's directorial debut, and he proves an adept replacement for Wan, a well-regarded stylist now at the helm of mega-budget tent-pole releases.  There are many suspenseful sequences and nicely macabre flourishes throughout, and the antagonist (teased at first in the shadow-enshrouded distance, waving) is the most grotesque and menacing member of the Insidious rogues' gallery to date.  It is the screenplay where problems arise.  The film has an unusual, distracting tendency to introduce and then drop peripheral characters:  Quinn's best friend, a neighbor with a crush on her, and, most strangely, her brother, a character who vanishes for long stretches and never seems overly aware of  or frightened by the situation in his home.  Why even include him and the others in the first place?  The climax, involving, of course, a fateful trip into the world of lost and malevolent spirits (the so-called Further), is undercut by a predictable and saccharine deus ex machina.  And there is even a degree of confusion as to who the protagonist of the film is:  fresh face Quinn and the returning Elise are both brave, sympathetic, well-acted female characters, so it is hard too complain a great deal, but there is a sense they are competing for the limelight, with the film losing interest in the longing and torment of Quinn as it becomes more invested in the question of whether Elise will embrace her fate as a type of paranormal avenger.",1433635200,21,2645,5.064516129032258

The movie is super creepy, and this one is even more ""jumpy"" than the other two.  My son jumped a few times and so did I.  The movie is about a teenage girl who has a spirit from the ""further"" following around.  It starts physically harming her and takes over her body.  The movie is creepy from the first few minutes, so there are no slow parts.  It is a good watch and there is no sex or swearing so it is ok for younger kids that can tolerate scary movies.

7266816,3,B00YT8SFR4,"The whole series was not all that scary to me because I have seen scarier movies than this because they do not really explain what the further is and where it was created, the first movie made sense to a certain extent but in the further subsequent releases (Number 2) throws me for a loop because they focus on the Lambert family but do not really tell you how the entities attached themselves to that family, there seems to be a lot missing to the story lines and whether they were based on potentially true events, it seems that when I am looking at the reviews they are trying or attempting to lop them in with the movie The Conjuring which is based on the supposed true life events of the Ed & Lorraine Warren Amityville Long Island events brought up in the movies about the Amityville Horror movies. Seems to me that it jumps around a lot and doesn't explain the events and what led up to the them. I have no idea how this teenage girl and her father have anything to do with the Lambert family unless the producers are going to tell you that in the subsequent movies made after these 3.

7266901,4,B00YT8SFR4,"CONTAINS  SOME  SPOIILERS .

The first movie was amazing, it was a really good, unique story, and it was really scary and full of emotion.
During the first one, it was so scary that I actually screamed out loud.
It is about a little boy who does astral projection (where you are able to have out-of-body experiences so that you can leave your body and fly anywhere you want), and so he finally went too far and traveled out to the Further, so that he is in a coma and may never wake up.
Elise (the psychic who connects with the dead) and the little boy's father travel into the Further to pull the little boy out.
I highly recommend the first one.

The second movie was good, but not as good as the first one.
The second was an immediate continuation of where the first ended.
The second was not as scary, and it felt more like it was tying up loose ends and completing the first, which wasn't even necessary.

This third movie was nowhere near as good as the first two.
This third one has no connection to the first two, except for the demon woman who wants to kill Elise, which was a very small part of this movie.
Except for the character of Elise, this movie really had nothing to do with the first two.

This movie started out really good.
A girl (Quinn) visits Elise to try to reach her dead mother.
Quinn tells Elise that she has questions for her mother, but we never find out what those questions were.
After trying to reach her mother, without success, a demon comes out instead.
Right after Quinn gets hit by a car, the movie started going downhill.
She has two broken legs in plaster casts and is helpless without her wheelchair or to be carried in and out of bed.

It was not scary.
There were jump scares, but I saw all of them coming because it would get very quiet and slow first.

I thought that it was actually cruel for the demon to lift and throw a girl with two broken legs.
Then she ends up with a protective collar around her neck because now her neck is also injured.
Then, the demon possesses the girl and walks around on her two broken legs, kicking her plaster casts until they break right off.
And three men just sit on the floor and watch all of thisthey don't look afraid or in disbelief, they just stare and do nothing to help the girl.
The possessed girl limps around on two broken unprotected legs, and you can hear the broken bones crackling, and yet, she is stronger than the three men.
At the end, we never know what happens to Quinn's two broken legs, but she probably will never walk normally ever again.

The demon was not scary, just a little creepy and weird.
The demon looked too weak and fragile to be scary, it was just a sick old man with a breathing mask, actually named, ""The Man Who Can't Breathe.""
All that needed to be done, which was finally done, was to remove his breathing mask.
I didn't see any anger or evil coming out of the demon, he just looked like a pathetic old man who was only desperate to breathe and live.
This demon has no reason to ""attach himself to Quinn,"" except for that he died in that building and Quinn just happens to be there.

There was a boy next door, Hector, who really liked Quinn.
But right after her car accident, we never see him again.
As soon as she was injured, he lost interest in her.

There was an old lady next door, Grace, who was dying and had a little bit of a connection to the other side because she was so ill.
After she died, she tried to connect with Elise to help Quinn.
A lot more could have been done with that character, but they didn't use her enough.

The little brother, Alex, appeared to care more about Quinn than anyone else, even though Elise made him leave before the final scene.
He should have stayed because it would have been more interesting if Alex had gone into the Further with Elise.

Elise did not have the strength and determination that she did in the first two movies.
In the first two movies, Elise wanted to help and really cared.
In this movie, Elise was afraid and tired, she just wanted to lie in bed holding her dead husband's vest and her old dog.
Elise seemed to help Quinn at the end because she felt like she had to, like she didn't have much choice, not because she wanted to or because she cared at all.
The emotion was gone from this movie, the strength and desire to fight the demons was not there, the desperate caring between the family members was not there.
Quinn's father looked tired and emotionally beaten down, like after his wife died, he didn't care about anything anymore.
The same was true of Elise, her husband committed suicide and she just existed without him, she retired from psychic work and became afraid of the demons and the Further.
All of this is why the third movie was not as good as the first two.",1455408000,,4762,4.301339285714286

7267012,4,B00YT8SFR4,"I have no idea why, but I really like a good scare now and again. It is not the blood and guts slasher or the forces of Darwinism eliminating American freshmen sub-genres which do it for me, it is always the supernatural stuff. The Grudge is still my benchmark 11 score on the scare-ometer and Insidious 3 could very possibly have been a contender to share the coveted top spot if it weren't for the usual rather daft and surreal final act meanderings in the astral plane referred to as The Further.

We were confused by the chronology so after watching this movie we re-watched the first two films so, if you are in similar need, I have tried to very briefly summarise them in the footnote below.

This movie is set at an unspecified time before the events portrayed in the first film and opens with Quinn, a young student, seeking out now retired Elise to help her contact her recently dead mother. To describe more of the plot would definitely constitute a spoiler but suffice to say there is a near death experience, possession and spooky goings-on aplenty. Younger versions Specs and Tucker, our now familiar paranormal investigators are of course on hand to um investigate.

This is by far the scariest of the three movies so far, making the previous films seem incredibly mild by comparison. The pace and tension is never allowed to lag (until the usual astral plane meanderings) and the tick-tick-boom jumps are so well orchestrated that you cant help jumping. It may well be a somewhat formulaic ticking of genre boxes but it has sufficient character and genuine atmosphere to stand out from the crowd.

Footnote [Obviously spoiler alerts for first two movies and thanks to Wikipedia for some details]:

Insidious 1: Set in the present day (2011 as-was). The Lambert Family (father Josh, mother Renai, sons Dalton and Foster and baby daughter Cali) move into a new house. Dalton has an accident in the attic after having been drawn there one night by strange noises and falls into an unexplained coma, eventually being cared for at home. [ One of the many things that confuses me  the spooky goings-on are supposed to have been initiated by Daltons accident but prior to that Renai finds a missing box from the move up in the attic and the furnace (in the attic?) lights by itself] Spooky things ensue; Foster says Dalton is walking about at night, the baby monitor picks up strange noises, door opening, etc. etc. Joshs mother (Lorraine) calls in a medium (Elise) and a pair of paranormal investigators. It turns out that Dalton is not in a coma but lost on the astral plane. It also turns out that Elise knows Josh from years earlier as she helped Lorraine with a similar problem when he was young after he was attacked by the spirit of an old woman in a black wedding dress (link to the second and third movies). Josh goes walkabout on the astral plan, rescues Dalton and returns. However, Joshs old woman spirit has followed them through and Josh / old woman strangles Elise. The End.

 Insidious 2: In a prologue we see Josh as a young boy in 1986 as Elise saves him from the old woman spirit and it is agreed to make Josh forget the incident. In the present day the story continues; the family move to Lorraines house while the police investigate Elises death. Spooky things continue to happen. The paranormal investigators go to Elises house and find a video tape of her encounter with Josh 25 years earlier and, Dalton is having bad dreams again, this time about a woman in white. Carl (a friend of Lorraines who introduced her to Elise in the first film) contacts dead Elise and she directs them to a disused hospital where Lorraine used to work. There they find the old room of a patient called Parker who killed himself. At Parkers home they find a hidden room of female corpses and a black wedding dress. It is increasingly apparent that Josh is possessed by Parkers spirit but Carl and the paranormal investigators from the first film fail to expel the spirit and Carl ends up in The Further where Parkers abuse at the hand of his mother, who wanted a girl, is revealed. Queue the now familiar confusing surreal astral plane stuff. In the end everybody is lead back to the living world where all is again OK with the Lamberts. The End, more-or-less.",1452988800,,4271,4.62532981530343

7267036,4,B00YT8SFR4,"Spoiler only at the end: I love the Insidious franchise so I was biased twords this movie to start. I wanted to love it, but along side of the others it lacks something. We went through the house at Halloween Horror Nights 25 before seeing this and the house made me think the movie was going to be scarier than it was. I guess I set myself up for failure. James Wan is a master at setting up a psychological scare. The moments of quiet where you don't realize you have stopped breathing and that the hairs are standing up on the back of your neck. Leigh Wannell has been hit or miss at this in the past, and this is no exception. If James Wan would come back to this series, it would be a dream come true.

I wish they had given at least a clue to what Elise saw at the end of 2. I know this is a prequel but when you wait that long in between movies, you wish to be thrown a proverbial bone. Spoiler: The addition of redface at the end was laughable and it felt like the director was forced to put that in by someone thinking we couldn't go a whole movie without seeing him.

The only scare factor of the movie was that the audio was pretty quiet and I had to turn my tv up very high, so when the ""scary"" parts happened I would jump because they were ten times louder than the rest of the movie.

If I don't notice ""bad"" acting then I consider it good. I didn't notice any bad acting in this film. Nice production.

I3 sure demonstrates how incredibly ridiculous beliefs about ghosts and hauntings and an afterlife really are. Let's call it...The Further. Yes yes, sweetie. By all means, call it The Further. That sounds suitably airy-fairy and mystical. I rented this because I can usually suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy a good scare. But the dead EARNESTNESS of this Insidious outing just kept breaking the spell and reminding me how stupid the premise is, so I was never able to enjoy it as horror.

It was OK & although it was technically how it all started, it was not quite as scary as the first to which I hoped it would be at least as scary.  The other issue is if this was the beginning & tells the story of how she got into the biz & teamed up with the 2 guys, why is it she looked 10yrs older in this one than the others.
I am a fan of the Insidious movies however this one left me a little blah.  If you are a fan I would still recommend seeing it, if you can get it for $5 or wait until it is on one off the movie channels if you have them or on demand!",1449532800,,600,3.4962406015037595

7267122,5,B00YT8SFR4,I love scary movies but often times I am left feeling disappointed and let down with the overall plot and acting. Most scary movies of today are either extremely gory or the new movies that pretend people are actually filming live and it is unseen footage we are about to embark on. I loved this movie because it is more of a traditional spooky ghost story with an amazing plot and superb actors to compliment the overall movie.

I would recommend that if you don't know this series, then start with Chapter 3 and THEN watch  the first and the second chapter. It works superbly as we see the well crafted characters introduce some later story elements and play through the central characters in the previous time line. Lin Shaye is very consistent with the later ( time-wise) versions of events, and plays out a strong and sympathetic character as we get to see her back story",1448236800,,513,4.7

7267215,4,B00YT8SFR4,"Insidious 3 is a great addition to the Insidious series. Although not as amazing as Insidious 1 I felt it took a great turn with a prequel no less. The Insidious series is more about the scary phantoms in The Further rather then the humans being attacked and while it does have returning characters it focuses more on the ghost and the victim more like Insidious 1. A big plus too 3 is it made Insidious 2 more enjoyable for me by filling in the little pieces lost between characters in the first 2 movies. If you have watched and enjoyed 1 and 2 the third chapter will be just as enjoyable and a nice string to tie the movies together. If you have not watched the series at all and wish to test the waters on this horror franchise i recommend watching this movie first as it is the first in the timeline and retains the quality throughout. In short, I love this series and for a horror movie to have 3 good movies is a rarity nowadays but well worth the watching time.",1448236800,,969,4.243243243243243

I wasn't expecting much from this movie as it is the third of the series, and although the movie starts slow and continues at a slower pace, the build up to the suspenseful moments are well done.  When it's time to scare you, it does.  Story weakens towards the end but the beauty of this series is how every movie ties so well together.

7267292,5,B00YT8SFR4,"LOVE this movie.
I'm a big fan of the first two. I don't get scared easily, and the first movie made me scream. Granted, a jump scare isn't the same as being scared, but it delighted me so much that I have very fond memories of watching it. I love when sequels use the same characters as the first movie, and we all know how sequels usually suck. In the Insidious franchise, however, that isn't the case. Not only did this movie include three characters from the previous two, Elise being the main one, but it gave us bits too. Like how Elise started helping others and some insight into what happens to her in movie 2.

If it wasn't for Elise and the two guys, this would've been a rather predictable horror movie. Not bad, still entertaining, but probably a 3 to 4 star rating depending on what you like. I loved the main girl and her family. My daughter felt they were average...until we got deeper in and the tie-ins happened. Then she was very pleased and changed her opinion from ""okay"" to ""great"". The tie-ins to the previous movies made this one extra special.

If you're a fan of the first two, definitely watch this. If you weren't...well, why are you reading this then? ;)",1447718400,,1183,4.422018348623853

I had never heard the name Lin Shaye until I saw Insidious. (I know!, I know...) Since then, I have obviously done a little research on her and her amazing filmography has almost turned into a checklist for me. Lin completely blew the cinema curtains away from the screen in this one. Magnificent, believable acting she does! ...and for a character as intense and involved in the storyline, it would require someone like Lin to pull it off perfectly...or don't even bother.

7267532,3,B00YT8SFR4,"I enjoyed the first Insidious film a great deal; as a quick preface however, it should be noted that as far as horror films go, I tend to set them in their own very secluded category. That said, as far as horror films go the first installment was, in my own opinion, pretty well done. The characters were at the very least, likable and mostly they could be related to. Absurd jump-scares were minimal and there was a story there, even if it wasn't the most unique thing you've ever seen. Perhaps the most unique part of the first two films were the ghost-hunteresque trio who helped to identify the issues of the family and walked them through how to rid themselves of their poltergeist.
This film follows pretty well in those same traditions; the family is semi-likable, though not quite as much as the first, IMO. There are still some jump scares but like the other two, they're not stupid and the film relies more heavily on the creepiness of the poltergeist and the events dealing with them. And once more, the family is forced to rely on the assistance of the same trio of ghost-hunters to save themselves from the uninvited ghosts. This film is technically a prequel and if you liked the first two films you may enjoy seeing how the three ghost-hunters end up meeting one another as well as a more detailed back-story for the medium.
You can certainly watch this film without seeing the other two, although its entertainment value is strengthened if you have seen the others, however, it still works well enough as its own film. If you're looking for a horror film to watch and you haven't seen the prior installment then I'd recommend watching those first, as they were better. Still, all in all, it's a solid film with a decent story and I think that so far as horror films are concerned this series is better than most. If you're looking for something in the same vein you may also enjoy The Conjuring.",1446508800,3,1911,4.558139534883721

This is a prequel to the first two films concerning the old lady psychic, who looks even older and sick in this film. She retired from ghost hunting but a young teenage girl ask her to help contact her dead mother so she can speak with her. She attempts to in the most ridiculous fashion and fails but apparently in doing so something evil starts stalking the teenage girl. Pretty weak setup with no real explanation. The main Further villain this time thats causing all the problems is a thin,  naught, cancer  looking patient man with a oxygen mask. His name is, ready for this, ""the man who cant breath"". There is no explanation who this guy is or what his back story is or why he is terrorizing and possessing this girl other then he is evil.
The whole thing felt like left over bits from the first films that couldn't make the cut. Like the directed went in and shot a few new scenes, added the left overs and threw them in a pot to see what he came up with.
The story really turns to silly when the old lady psychic finally enters the Further and starts kicking the ass of the woman in black who apparently gets scared and runs off, not being seen again until the 1st film. Then she meets the man who cant breath and kung-fu's his ass with a running kick. Really?!? So a fragile old woman can beat the s*** out of demons? It plays out so ridiculous and is very laughable.
The end scene is nothing more then a cheap money grab so people will go back and watch the first films. It shows the Darth Maul looking demon appear next to the old woman.....end of story.

7267665,3,B00YT8SFR4,Didn't feel like it should've been part of the Insidious series.  Felt different and prequels should never add things that were not present in other movies.

The villain an old guy with a oxygen mask ?!?! not as scary as a demon or a total insane guy running around in full makeup wearing a black wedding dress. Elise in the 1st movie was so confident and strong even in the 2nd movie but this one she is a total wreck, very odd. I did like how they kept the victim(s) very ordinary, plain people just living life but got caught up.

7267704,2,B00YT8SFR4,"The ridiculously inept title of this film alone should indicate everything you need to know about this clunker, seeing as how the filmmakers do not understand the meaning of the word Chapter, nor the value of the number 3.

As this film was subtitled Chapter 3, one would logically expect it to be a continuation of Chapters 1 and 2. So once the movie gets rolling with no connection to the family in parts 1 and 2, I had to Google the film to discover what was happening and why I was watching this thing. So it turns out that this film is actually a prequel, which is not even explained in the film. And by the end, there is still zero connection to the heroes of the first two parts, though a few supporting characters from those films feature in this one. So this movie is sold on a lie, as its more akin to a reboot or spin-off, rather than having any major connection to a broader history.

Besides that disingenuous labeling, the film is just not very good. There are some okay moments of tension and creepy shots, but overall the film is largely forgettable. The series has had diminishing returns, and the filmmakers deficiencies to concoct a decent premise for a third movie extends through their vanilla storyline, stiff characters and weak scares.

This movie also has some of the worst and most obnoxious sound mixing Ive ever heard. To score the cheapest kicks, the mundane volume in the movie is suddenly cranked up to atom-bomb levels of screeching noise to induce their jump scares. The trick is annoying the first few goes, but grows even more annoying when these audio explosions continue to sound false alarms.

An overall frustrating experience, this film is barely worth your time. Though I would be remiss if I didn't say at least the film ends with a terrific scare.",1445904000,,1790,4.584375

With every scary movie these days you're going to pass through some cheesy scenes and predictability but the surprise factor was definitely dominant in this film.  Wasn't expecting that seeing as it's the third chapter and movies tend to digress when that many are made in connection to another but this one broke the mold and turned out to be a pleasantly terrifying prequel",1445904000,,546,4.677083333333333

Its that time of year again, when things that go bump in the night roam the streets in search of candy, things that scare us come out from under the bed to drink apple cider and of course movies that make us toss our popcorn into the air make their way to the big and small screen. The month has a number of horror movies making their way to DVD and this week we start the month with one of those. Written and directed by Leigh Whannell, the creator/writer of the first two films in the series, is INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 3.

If you recall the first two films they involved a family haunted by spirits that have left this world to move on to a place known as The Further. This time around the story goes back in time, a prequel to events that happened in those films. It helps us understand The Further a bit better as well as the reasons why the character of Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) does what she does.

The movie opens with a young girl named Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) approaching Elise to do a psychic reading for her. Elise tells her she doesnt do that anymore but is convinced to help the girl who wants to speak to her recently deceased mother. The girl has tried to reach her on her own with no success and yet feels her mother is there. Elise does a reading for her and recoils in fear, telling the girl not to attempt to reach her mother again because when you call out to one of the dead, they all hear.

Quinn returns home disappointed but then things begin to happen, the most terrible of which is her being hit by a car. Quinn survives and ends up homebound with two broken legs as well as other injuries. Her father Sean (Dermot Mulroney) is concerned for her and does all he can to make her comfortable. Even her younger brother Alex tries to help. But try as they might, this is where the scares start to happen and things go from bad to worse.

It starts with something small, Quinn tapping on the wall of her bedroom, the same wall shared by the boy next door she thinks is cute. He taps back so she texts him. He responds by telling her he isn't home but at his grandmothers. Cue jump scare. If you don't know what a jump scare is, its when in a movie they do something guaranteed to make you jump. No spoiler here as this one featured prominently in the trailer for this film.

Quinn begins to see more and more while alone in her room or the apartment. A ghostly image of a man with a mask on continues to appear before her. When noises are heard in the apartment upstairs and the ceiling cracks, her dad sees this and takes the building super with him to check it out. The apartment is vacant and yet there on the floor are slimy footprints of bare feet.

While all of this is going on Elise remains home concerned about the girl having had visions of her. She wants to help her but at the same time is frightened of what will happen to her if she does. The movie tells us why shes afraid and what she was looking for when this frightening event changed her life. Since she appears in the first two movies (that take place after this one) we know shell come out all right, but what about Quinn? Will Elise be able to help the girl or will she face banishment from this world at the hands of a demon Elise is unwilling to confront?

The movie won't go down in the annals of horror films as the best movie ever made but it won't be considered one of the worst either. The two previous films were well made and frightening enough that in making a third the bar was set high. While it doesnt quite reach the level of those movies this one does present an entertaining enough film that holds your interests and does a good job of filling in some of the blanks from the previous films.

While all of the actors here do a great job Shaye deserves more credit than she ever gets. Shes a familiar face to movie fans who most will remember from her roles in the comedy films of the Farrelly brothers like KINGPIN and DUMB AND DUMBER, but once she got the attention of casting directors she began appearing in a number of horror films. She always turns in a performance that is outstanding and makes the roles she takes on believable, something not easy to accomplish in a horror film.

As the days grow colder, the nights grow longer, as leaves change and fall and every dog that howls seems to take on an ominous tone, horror films during the month of October just seem like the thing to watch. INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 3 is one worth watching and having a good time with. While rated only PG-13 I would say that most kids won't have a problem with this movie. If they're impressionable perhaps you might hold off a while though. For most it will be as fun filled as a trip to the haunted mansion.",1445904000,,4761,4.245033112582782
7267725,4,B00YT8SFR4,"Now this is what I am talking about. It had rising falling action, great acting, and a thrill a minute. I would really recommend this movie.",1445817600,,140,4.423076923076923
7267726,5,B00YT8SFR4,"Taking place several years before the first two Insidious movies (but after the flashback portions of Chapter 2), Insidious Chapter 3  finds the psychic Elise (Lin Shaye) living in quiet seclusion after having retired from her role as a paranormal researcher and clairvoyant.  When a girl named Quinn (Stefanie Scott) tracks her down and seeks her help in putting her in touch with her dead mother, Elise is reluctantly persuaded to help, but calls a swift end to the session after something frightens her.  She encourages Quinn to abandon her quest, warning her that ""when you call one of the dead, they can all hear"".

However, the door to the other side has been opened a crack, and after Quinn is in an accident that puts her temporarily near death, that provides the catalyst for it to open further.  When she and her family are now the target of dark forces from the other side, Elise is pulled back into the situation to try and help.  We also begin to find out what scared Elise so badly during one of her trips to the Further that she pulled out of the whole thing for a period of several years.  Elise gets more time in the spotlight in this chapter of the series, giving her a backstory and also showing that she can be quite the badass character when  the situation requires.  Quinn and her family make for a  likeable group to be in the crosshairs this time, and the whole cast, including the players for the demonic characters from the Further, do a great job.  Also worth noting is that, once again, the music and sound effects do a fantastic job heightening the atmosphere and eerie-ing things up.  The whole film is a great addition to the Insidious line, and one of 2015's best movies.",1445817600,,1703,4.547540983606558

This 3rd one was pretty disappointing and I am so glad that I only rented it ,definitely will not be wasting my money by adding this to my collection.

It's not a bad horror flick, but it doesn't deploy its antagonist with the sense of creepiness that we get in the first flick. We have a villain for no great reason and it turns into a bunch of one-off scenes that try hard at cheap thrills. It's a backstory that's not necessary, with a one dimensional plot, carried on the capable shoulders of  Lin Shaye who's great.

7267817,2,B00YT8SFR4,"I liked the first one quite a lot. The second one didn't do very much differently, but it was OK. But this one is pretty poor and I gave up half way through. It lacked suspense entirely, the primary ""monster"" was tedious and it relied entirely on jump scares. Even that was a kick in the teeth because of the way that the audio has been recorded. To hear any of the dialog at all, you needed to turn the volume right up. Then when something supposedly scary happens, there's a massive jump in volume.

The only thing I was scared of was possible hearing loss and the damage done to my relationship with my neighbors. I know this is a first time director, but he's been around horror long enough to know that you need to do more than creep up behind people and shout ""Boo!"" to be effective.

However, I watched the movie hoping it would pick up where it left off on Insidious: Chapter 2. But to my disappointment, it didn't. To be honest, I don't like when a movie doesn't follow a storyline and it's kind of a hodgepodge of randomness. The lack of continuity really was a turnoff for me, despite it being a good movie.

Another thing that was an issue was that it didn't address anything that was seen in the first two movies. I will not elaborate beyond that to protect the interests of those who haven't seen it, so I'll leave it there.

I was impressed with the plot line and how the actors responded to the terrifying effect of soul possession. I don't know who the young victim was but she was terrific. I liked the different ages portrayed too. Not just a group of screaming kids, and gore. This movie is not for young children.

7268316,2,B00YT8SFR4,"Tisk Tisk, please hand this back over to Wan. Let down after the first two films. Was great to get some background on Elise and ""the boys"" but even the presentation of her struggle to overcome just comes across a bit cheesy at times. This story was full of plot holes (which may have been an intentional effort for later tie ins as with the first two but didn't work out nearly as well). The bad guy could be a demon, but then we see he did live there once, but we still don't know why he was tracking around mud like the world's worst house guest, and I strongly suspect he may be the Marlboro Man. The subtle scares just aren't there as much, even the creepy camera work/overall look and feel failed. This is overly evident at the end when we see the ""revenge of the sith"" demon from the first flick. Instead of being subtle and therfore less hokey we see him well lit face forward and he is now clearly just some goth dude who has too much red lipstick on his face and time on his hands. That scene in particular reminded me of the cheeto-esq slasher horror of elm street. The further was apparently not as cool and scary as it later became, and we actually encounter a ghost here who can not only speak like a normal person but is helpful without being creepy at all. I thought perhaps we were just in the poorly lit alley behind Costco talking to a really helpful (if upset) hobo there for a second. Backwards face girl attempted to save, but alas, the task was too great for this little trooper. Elise and the guys were by far the saving grace. Disappointed me and mine on so many levels. I suppose if they couldn't have Wan then this guy was the next best thing, but it just didn't work as well. At all. He is a good writer and i really like his acting and character(s), but it's best for fans and franchise bottom lines if we could all move on to chapter 4 with Wan and pretend this little misstep never happened. :(",1444348800,,1924,4.230978260869565

7268354,4,B00YT8SFR4,"""Insidious: Chapter 3"" is great! This is how the story goes: A prequel set before the haunting of the Lambert family that reveals how gifted psychic Elise Rainier reluctantly agrees to use her ability to contact the dead in order to help a teenage girl who has been targeted by a dangerous supernatural entity.

The cast led by Dermot Mulroney (as Sean Brenner), Stefanie Scott (as Quinn Brenner), Angus Sampson (as Tucker), Leigh Whannell (who also wrote & directed the film) (as Specs) & Lin Shaye (as Elise) is great. The directing & story & screenplay by Whannell is great.

The music by Joseph Bishara is great. The cinematography by Brian Pearson is great. The film editing by Tim Alverson is great. The casting by Terri Taylor is great. The production design by Jennifer Spence is great. The art direction by Jason Garner is great. The set decoration by Lori Mazuer, set dressings by Jeremy Cisneros, Brenner Hugh Harris, Adam Kirby, George W. Kiel, Dean Lakoff, Mark Sunga, Kurt Keitzman, Robert Ross & Kai Blomberg is great. The costume design by Ariyela Wald-Cohain is great. The special make-up effects designed by Justin Raleigh is great. The special effects coordinated by Steve Newquist and supervised by John Hartigan is great. The visual effects coordinated by Rachel Barkow & Tyler Bennink and supervised by James David Hattin, Matthew Lynn & James Jooyoung Lee is great. The stunts coordinated by Mark Rayner is great.

This is a great, well-done and well-made prequel / horror movie that is entertaining. Leigh Whannell has made a great directorial debut (rightfully so, taking over from James Wan, the director of the first two ""Insidious"" movies, who also produced on the film and makes an appearance in the film, as well, too). Lin Shaye is also solid yet again as Elise Rainier. This is (or was) one of the better movies of the summer season and also one of the best horror movies of the year, so far, as well.",1444262400,2,1933,4.816265060240964

Elise, who tries and fails to help Quinn contact her mother at the beginning of the film, attempts to come to Quinn's rescue. But Elise herself has to contend with an evil spirit determined to kill her whenever she uses her psychic gift.

7268482,3,B00YT8SFR4,"Insidious: Chapter 3 is a prequel that takes place before the haunting of the Lambert family. Paranormal investigators Tucker (Angus Sampson) and Specs (Leigh Whannell) team up with the psychic Elise (Lin Shaye) to help Quinn (Stefanie Scott), a teenage girl who believes that her late mother is trying to make contact. Initially, Elises horrific past makes her reluctant to use her ability, but when Quinns desperate father begs for assistance, she agrees to venture into the astral plane known as The Further. There, she finds a ruthless supernatural entity with a voracious craving for the souls of the living.

Screenwriter Leigh Whannell, who created the Saw franchise with director James Wan, makes his own directorial debut with this third installment of the Insidious franchise. To qualify for a PG-13 rating, the movie isn't especially scary, and much of it is predictable. There are nice touches, such as unexpected sounds, grasping hands, grotesque faces emerging from the darkness, and oily footprints, but they don't result in any big scares. Weve seen similar bits in many other horror films. Suspense is seriously muted because we know where the story is heading. The climactic sequence with the creepy Breathing Man is far superior to the rest of the picture, which unfolds tepid scenes at a sluggish pace.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include deleted scenes and the featurettes Origin Story: Making Chapter 3, Being Haunted: A Psychic Medium Speaks, Stunts: The Car Crash, and Macabre Creations. A digital HD copy is included.",1443916800,10,1553,5.183266932270916

When she contacts psychic Elise Rainier (Shaye) in hopes of talking to her dead mother. Elise's attempt unleashes a spirit that she tried to keep hidden and now neither her nor Quinn is safe. I don't scare easy. Most horror movies to me are comical. The ones that do scare me are the psychological ones like Exorcism of Emily Rose, Poltergeist (the original) Conjuring/Annabelle and the first Insidious. The first one really disturbed me to the point of me being hesitant to watch the second one. The second one was really missing something and it wasn't nearly as good as the original. Because of that I wasn't really sure what to expect from this one. After watching it I will say that it was better than the second one but not quite as good as the first. This one did have a few parts that creeped me out but nothing to the extent that the original did. The movie, being a prequel, did a good job of setting up the first one and I enjoyed that part of it. As for the rest of it, this is worth seeing if you have seen the others but don't go in expecting to see something as scary as the original. Overall, a very good addition to the series.

7268531,3,B00YT8SFR4,"It is worth a watch, though, especially if you like this series. Insidious Chapter 3 focuses on Lin Shaye's character Elise before the events of Chapter 1, and the parts of the plot that center directly on her are by far the best. As the film opens she gets a visit from Quinn Brenner (Stephanie Scott) a teenager who wants to connect with her deceased mother. Only, Quinn's already been reaching out by herself, which anyone who's heard of a ouija board knows you're not supposed to do. Quinn is easy to sympathize with. She's a bright girl who wants to be an actress and has assumed household responsibilities that used to belong to her mother. You see her father Sean (Dermot Mulroney) wanting to keep his contractor business competitive and losing patience with Quinn's desire to pursue her own college dreams because he doesn't have time to run herd on little brother Alex (Tate Berney) by himself. Sean redeems himself when Quinn winds up in danger, and the movie thankfully doesn't waste too much time with 'nobody believes me' time-wastiness. Alex is actually the one who finds the dynamic duo of Tucker And Specs online (shades of Ghostfacers there). I won't spoil anymore, but despite the sympathetic characters and familiar faces, Chapter 3 was just not as scary as previous chapters, although it certainly has some moments. I'd actually give it 3 1/2 stars, but this form won't let me.",1443225600,2,1397,4.800829875518672

Unfortunately, the sequel was just passable - not great, not horrible, just 'meh' - despite having all the original characters back. One could only imagine that a prequel would be stretching it way too far.
Well... surprise, surprise.
Chapter 3 (Chapter Zero?) is actually many steps up from the second movie: it is very atmospheric, tense when it should be and even funny in a few appropriate moments. The new characters are solid and relatable; the old characters, especially Lin Shaye's, show nuances of their personalities that actually make us understand the other movies in a more complete way. Shaye's Elise, by the way, surely is the highlight of the movie and shines in many different moments (the ""come on, b****"" bit had the audience clapping, just epic).
I don't know where they'd go if they ever did a Chapter 4, but I'll say that I'm glad that they released this one, and that the series did not end with the rather disappointing taste left by Chapter 2.",1438473600,19,1247,4.859154929577465

7268587,2,B00YT8SFR4,"Having watched both Insidious and its sequel, I expected the 3rd film to be in line with those films and equally fear evoking. Unfortunately for me, this film barely manages to thrill. The story seems a bit off, the ghost in this film is not even remotely scary, in fact it is so appalling that it felt like fans of Insidious have gone ahead and made a film on their own. This film is not nearly as good as other James Wan ventures. He is the producer on this film but the film seems to have no touches of an average James Wan film. Forget Insidious series or The Conjuring, this film is inferior to even Annabelle which to me was pretty good actually.

The plot is where the error lies, the film has absolutely no scares and I am once again disappointed by the film companies greed. Insidious and Insidious 2 were both worthy of being watched but this one I dare say is about as failing and unflinching to watch as they come. The storyline is bad, the scares are few and almost non-existant, the problem is that its just not scary at all. There is no play on your mind, it looks like the work of someone who suffers from holding attention. As you may know, horror requires attention to detail, attention to fear and understanding of human psyche...this film fails on all accounts. It is watchable so I am giving it 2 stars but trust you, me, do not spend any money on watching this film.

7268590,3,B00YT8SFR4,"James Wan's first Insidious was a scary surprise for the possession subgenre of horror films. The ideas presented were fresh enough to breath new life into a tired, cliche-ridden line of films that have all been heavily derived from The Exorcist, which is over 40-years-old at this point. Insidious: Chapter 3 features a new family, whose daughter is plagued by a disturbing new entity, ""the man who can't breathe."" This demon's signature breathing apparatus gives its corpse-like body a creepy and original look. The return of ""The Bride"" from both previous films is a bit uneccessary however, and I felt that the character was only included to add more screentime. While much better than the dissappointing Chapter 2, the 3rd Insidious still fails to touch the first entry's appeal. To be fair, it's a 3.5 star movie, which probably would have been better if directed by James Wan himself rather than rookie-director and series screenwriter Leigh Whannell.",1434844800,3,958,5.10828025477707
7268591,4,B00YT8SFR4,"While I'm a HUGE horror fan, I'm typically not a fan of the ""possession/exercism"" style horror movie.  To me, they're usually more geared towards a PG-13 rating to get the kids into the theater.  Honestly, they're usually not very scary at all.  I enjoyed this film, however.  I have the original in my collection, but passed on the second as I just wasn't interested enough to take the time to watch it (I might check it out though).

This story is a prequel to the original. It follows Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) as she attempts to make contact with her recently deceased mother, Lillith.  After trying on her own (apparently a VERY bad idea), she seeks out and enlists the help of a psychic named, Elise Rainier.  Recently retired from the trade, Elise initially turns Quinn down, but then ultimately decides to take on one more case.

I found the entire movie to be pretty entertaining and not quite as slow as I find the typical ""exorcist"" movie.  I never looked at the clock to see how much time I had left and there was enough depth in the characters to make me like actually like them.  The ONLY part of the movie I hated was the actual ""exorcism"" sequence.  Talk about total CHEESE, man!  It really did seem an after thought.  However, since it was only about 3-4 minutes of the movie, it didn't do nearly enough to steer me completely away.

Final Verdict:  Definitely worth watching!",1434758400,3,1398,4.580645161290323
7268592,2,B00YT8SFR4,"With the Lambert clan safely free of the colorful demon that terrorized them in the first two Insidious films, Insidious: Chapter 3 moves backwards rather than forwards to another haunted family. Series co-writer and co-star Leigh Whannell makes his directorial debut, taking over for his highly-successful partner James Wan, who has moved up to bigger things with Furious 7 and the upcoming Aquaman. Whannell, a gifted screenwriter when it comes to things that go bump in the night, crafts a compelling origin story for the franchise's popular psychic, Elise (Lin Shaye), but this trip to the Further is sorely lacking in the ominous atmosphere that Wan so effortlessly created.

The Elise we encounter now is no longer the confident ghost hunter we're familiar with; at this point in her life she's retired due to an evil spirit that has promised to kill her if she keeps using her psychic gifts. So when she's approached by 15-year-old Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) who desperately wants to contact her deceased mother Lilith, Elise is reluctant at first. Her compassion wins out, though, and she eventually agrees to make contact, only to realize the spirit she communicated with isn't Lilith...it's something more...insidious. She leaves Quinn with a simple warning we know is destined to be ignored: If you call out to one of the dead, all of them can hear you.

Whannell struggles to conjure up anything approaching a unique scare, relying on jump scares and bland musical bumps telegraphed from a mile away. That doesn't mean there aren't a few surprises, like the bone-shattering accident that leaves Quinn vulnerable to the demon's possession. Her desperate father (Dermot Mulroney), a single dad cracking under the pressure, can't make heads or tails of it when his injured daughter starts getting dragged around the house by unseen forces with sticky protoplasmic feet.

The film works best when filling in the gap left by the prior movies. Not only do we learn of Elise's tragic past, making her more of a sympathetic character than ever, but we also see the introduction of ghostbusting duo Specs and Tucker (played by Whannell and Angus Sampson), plus where the name ""The Further"" comes from. We also learn the identity of the veiled spirit that took possession of Patrick Wilson's character in the very first movie.

Whannell doesn't have Wan's gift for carefully orchestrated tension, however, leaving the film almost entirely devoid of suspense. On the plus side, Shaye's performance is so good that we're never bored when she's around. It's good to see her finally get a rare headlining role and she makes the most of it. This franchise truly belongs to her, and if it continues they need to find ways to bring her back. That's if it continues, though, and unfortunately Insidious: Chapter 3 doesn't give us any reason that it should.",1434672000,11,2854,5.014767932489452

7268594,4,B00YT8SFR4,"You don't need to have seen the other films to watch this one.

Lilith Brenner (Ele Keats) dies from breast cancer. Her daughter Quinn (Stefanie Scott) believes she is trying to contact her. Quinn seeks out medium Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) for help. Elise advises Quinn not to try to contact her mother. Eventually the plot goes to evil hauntings and ghost busters. 20 minutes from the end of the film Elise explains everything what is happening in case you hadn't figured it out

This was a decent film in a crowded genre. Unfortunately there was nothing outstanding about it. The acting was solid, scare factor okay in the dark, and no one running around with a hand held camera screaming and shooting the ground. I would have liked to have seen more character build up on Quinn, who seemed interesting.

7268596,5,B00YT8SFR4,This movie I saw with my two tied best friends because we always saw scary movies together but when the trailers were playing I thought this movie is so not going to be scary but I was wrong I find myself running out of the movie theater and wanting to see the movie spy but my babysitter Annie said my two best friends were in there and that we could not see spy so I just went to the game world and when my two best friends got out I wanted to watch the end of the movie but it was so scary I almost peed my pants but when I ran out Sam wanted to leave to but Katherine told her to just sit down and then I miss the teorfing ending,1433980800,,633,3.7669172932330826

8719084,2,B00YT8SFR4,"I thought about seeing this in theatres, but I'm very glad I didn't. First off, most of the acting in this is terrible. Obviously the actress who played Elise was good, but the other actors were various degrees of bad, though the lead actress has potential. The plot, in my opinion, was pretty dumb and it really does not lend any justice to the first two movies. It was also a bit inconsistent, although I will say the pace was alright. I don't want to go too much into detail because I have a habit of spoiling movies without trying.
I will say that this movie was not scary to me or my boyfriend, and we are not very picky in that realm. Overall, I feel like this film is mediocre and I do not recommend it. Obviously, a lot of people in the reviews seem to like it. I'm just not one of those people.",1533686400,,803,4.153846153846154

8719088,3,B00YT8SFR4,"( NO spoiler review) I love Elise, she makes the entire movie in this movie. I just adore her. There was an element missing though, maybe because James Wan didn't direct it? We are dedicated Insidious fans, but not sure of some of the elements that evolve women. Without going into detail, I prefer not to watch the "" Helpless and victimized"" women movies, Elise is a strong woman, and that's why we love her, and some were not in this movie. I am not sure why the writer had to go here? Then it also went to the young teenager female, as many movies do , which totally sucks, because Elise has earned my respect, and her age is timeless. It was like Elise was handing over the torch the entire movie, and Elise should have been respected more in the writers eyes, and kept, and honored.
