7771459,5,B01H1VSVME,"This is a review of the show before its formal release on Blu/UV this August.

Anyone who hasn't jumped on the Netflix bandwagon is missing one of the best shows to have been conceived and delivered to the platform. And this August, it looks like the first season will finally be making its localized release to Blu/Digital and DVD/Digital with Season 2 available a few days later on Netflix.

Narcos is a crime thriller that follows the rise of Pablo Escobar and the Medellin Cartel, alongside the law enforcement divisions branching Colombia and the United States that worked to combat them. Through the first season, we experience Pablo Escobar as the man he becomes reputed as, earning his eventual nickname as the King of Cocaine and his belief of ""plata o plomo"", or ""money or lead"" in his dealings. This gives us a story where neither side experiences victory or defeat easily. The strength in the storytelling shows us that neither Escobar and the Medellin Cartell nor the authorities banded together to fight him come out ahead for long. Every episode shows the jousting of these two sides, one coming out ahead of the other with each move until it culminates into an ending that is modestly satisfying and leaves one wanting more.

At the head of this story is also the cast. Wagner Moura, a Brazilian actor known for his work in the Elite Squad duology, plays Pablo with a chillingly strong resemblance. The other two leads play the various men of their law enforcement agencies: Boyd Holbrook, known for Gone Girl, A Walk Among the Tombstones, and Behind the Candelabra, plays DEA agent Steve Murphy and is as sound an American presence as you can imagine. Pedro Pascal, aka Oberyn ""The Red Viper"" Martell in Game of Thrones, plays fellow DEA agent Javier Pea as a man who shows more talent for the Colombian world than he lets on at times. Other appearances range from Richard T Jones to Luis Guzmn to other notable appearances of actors and actresses from a solid range of nationalities. And there is not an appearance that feels wasted.

Narcos was also handled entirely within Colombia, giving authenticity to the world of Narcos and to show dedication to the show's quality.

Overall, I cannot say what sort of goodies the physical release will incorporate beyond the option of either Blu-Ray with HD Digital or DVD with SD Digital (as is the standard currently). That part of the review will wait via update later when said product is procured. However, the quality of the show is what this review entails. Anyone who cannot justify Netflix as of yet will have a chance to own this sleeper hit of a show from last year and enjoy it to its entirety. It gets a strong recommendation from me, along with the coming of Season 2 (which will follow Escobar's story and the introduction of new stories to join with it) in September on Netflix.",1466467200,13,2854,4.72289156626506

Wagner Moura is handsome and roly-poly but has no menace about him; he's lifeless onscreen (I know, he's a silent menace, even more frightening!--please). And Boyd Holbrook's narration is flat and tedious, a big mistake; his acting is, well, he's no Don Johnson, ha.  There's a chase in episode 7 that perks things up, but it's a long wait to get there. If you're looking for a Spanish Sopranos, forget it. That was TV at its best; this is for binge watchers who will watch anything.

7771500,5,B01H1VSVME,"Amazing. This is a great serialization of Pablo Escobar's life and times.
They have taken some drama licenses, so please manage your expectations. Also, make note the Spanish being spoken is in ""mumbles"" and for those of us that speak Spanish you will most definitely feel and hear the difference. This isn't native South American lingo.
This is to be expected since there are many Brazilian and Portuguese actors speaking a tongue not native to them.
You'll hear the difference between their Spanish and the actor playing Gacha, Luis Guzman.
However, this does not tarnish the series at all.
It is one of the better shows I've seen this year.
I understand Netflix greenlit seasons 3 and 4. However, I fail to see what the story would be about? Lets wait and see and hopefully the show won't be ruined.",1478649600,7,802,4.735714285714286
7771501,3,B01H1VSVME,"Narcos is a tv series about drug trafficking and it begins with the Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. A few years ago a series on Escobar had also been made by Colombian television, becoming the most successful Latin-American tv series of all time. Since I reviewed the original Colombian tv series (which is a masterpiece), I thought of watching this American variant.

So how does this compare with the Colombian version?

First off, the Colombian series takes place around Escobar, his gang, and his victims: be it journalists, judges, magistrates, military and police (both corrupt or not), and even political candidates. It was also played by actual Colombian actors, with hundreds of speaking parts, making for the most expensive tv series ever done over there. The American version is told from the perspective of a DEA agent (actually two of them, making for a sort of Starsky and Hutch team of cops), and is a sort of a shortened-version of Escobars criminal life.

However, most of the principal roles are played by non-Colombian actors, and heres where the series suffers, even if the producers did it on purpose: they didn't care for the many different accents; they wanted only the best actors. Apparently most are from Mexico. I mean, here I heard accents coming from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil, and the series is supposed to take place in Colombia. And yes, there are some Colombian accents, but mostly from the extras, as it was indeed shot in Colombia. But listening to the main actor Walter Moura who plays Escobar, speak in a thick Brazilian accent, completely put me off. Why does Escobar speak like a foreigner? And the same goes for other principal characters, some whom barely speak any Spanish correctly.

Though Moura speaks with the same colloquialism, phrasing and inflections of the Colombian accent, his Brazilian-sounding Spanish sounds too foreign to my ears, or to those of anyone who speaks the actual language. Also hearing the actor who plays Minister of Justice Lara Bonilla speak in a heavy Mexican accent is almost ridiculous. The same goes for some of the sicarios, some speaking with a Colombian accent, and others being mainly Mexican actors speaking in their Mexican accent (words like pinche is Mexican colloquialism not used in Colombia at all). And this goes with many of the other secondary roles who are all apparently played by Mexican actors. Of the few who really nails a Colombian accent is the actor playing Escobars cousin Gustavo, who speaks with the actual Medelln paisa accent (I guess hes Colombian).

On a positive side, the producers did have the Latin actors speak in Spanish, as opposed to have them speak in broken English (which would have been ridiculous), or with a British accent so they would sound foreign (which would have been even worse). And most of the speaking parts are in Spanish, so this is quite a first for an American series. Add to that the fact that if you don't speak the language, you have to read subtitles. Extra points for having the viewers read, and get hooked onto the storyline all the same.

Another plus bonus, is that it was entirely shot in Colombia, in actual existing places and not inside a Hollywood studio. What you see is where it was shot, no film or studio trickery here. Thats another positive point, though the Colombian series was also shot that way.
Now, where this series suffers is in a couple of points. As I mentioned earlier with the many different Latin-American accents, contrary to the producers, I find it distracting. I mean, what would a film taking place in Texas, with supposedly Texan characters, sound if some actors spoke with a different accent coming from New Jersey, Boston, Chicago, or Southern California, and were all supposed to be Texan? It would sound rather silly, wouldnt it?

Also, its told with a narration or voice-over. Apparently they had too much terrain to cover, and so decided that an explanation was needed, to shorten details, time, and tell us what is happening. While this was an excellent short-cut in film thrillers of the thirties, the voice here, trying to sound deep, is incredibly monotonous, to the point that it had me dozing off at certain points. I feel it deadens the whole pace, frequently slowing down whats happening on the screen.

Escobars life was a drama; the sort rarely seen since the time of Roman Emperors or even from mad dictators such as Hitler. The Colombian series dealt with that, which made it so successful, but the general feeling you get from this American version, is that they somehow missed the boat by leaving many aspects of Escobars life out. We don't really feel the slow descent into paranoia and madness the character goes through, or have any actual empathy or hatred for him. Is he really that bad? Why does he want to kill everyone? Is he a psychopath? Why are his sicarios so faithful to him? In this series he simply has people killed for no apparent reason. The plane bombing, for instance, was aimed to kill not only a presidential candidate, but the leader of the M-19 guerrilla movement who was on board too. The whole plan was set by a Para-military group that wanted to get rid of the guerrilla leader. And Escobar thought itd be a great way to get rid of a possible presidential candidate who could probably sign the extradition that narcos feared so much, and so paid for it. All this is completely ignored in the series.

The ingredients are all here, but they took so many shortcuts, that it plays like a shortened version of Escobars life, or the CliffsNotes. You get only glimpses, but not the actual larger-than-life drama. The relation between Escobar and his sicarios, and his love for his family, are just two examples that are ineptly explored in this version.
I wanted to love this series, as they really put some effort on it, but ultimately I think they half-failed (many important details left off Escobars life), and half-succeeded (at least the parts among the colombians was spoken in Spanish, and it was shot in Colombia). Id suggest you also see the Colombian version that has fewer action sequences and no mention of the DEA, but gives you a better idea of what Escobar was really like. And theres no annoying voice-over.

Overall a mixed-bag of an effort, half-interesting (the life of a drug kingpin that would put to shame anyone else), half-boring (monotonous voice-over), even ridiculous at times (the kidnapped people walk unhurriedly into the arms of kidnappers, offering no resistance), with some annoying non-Colombian accents (some actors didn't even try to change their native accents), but worth a look if you have never heard of Escobar, otherwise, stick to the Colombian version or any documentary on Escobar.",1478390400,3,6770,4.863833477883781

7771520,5,B01H1VSVME,"I was looking for a good show to watch since its hard to find a good show where some of my favorite shows have been cancelled or come to an end like Fringe Dexter or the good wife. So I am Amazon and eBay shopping I come across an new show called narcos. Never heard of it I thought it was a documentary. I watched it last night I have to say it's really good. I will put it this way. Think of this show is like what Hbo used to be when we had OZ BIG LOVE THE WIRE AND THE CORNER. This is the best show on that hard core level. Is this worth buying if you are a fan of gangster drug dealing and crime drama this is up your alley. This show is very brutal. There is a lot of rape scenes. Sex is non stop on this show. The violence is very hard to watch at times where men women and children are killed. So if you are sensitive about this kind of shut then don't watch it and never view it. If you are willing to give it a chance you are going to see a world  that hope a d pray you never want to be in bc this is a scary world of drugs and violence that I think would scare the crap out of me.

So it's worth the buy and remember it's full of violence, death , craziness sex with some hot girls and this story is so unbelievable you can't believe this happened. Pablo is a true king pin a monster who made money off death and the people who brought him down did what they had to do to bring a monster down whether it was good or bad.
The performances are amazing to watch and this is classic in the world of TV gangster films. This film is half English and Spanish with subtitles. So remember this is a Latin story with harsh look into a man that will remember forever. The money in the drug business is strong and getting stronger but just bc one was taken down another one will follow in its place. Things that make you go Hmmm?

So wait for this movie to be a penny but if you are excited to buy this movie then wait till the price is right and you will be grateful you have this in your collection.

7771522,5,B01H1VSVME,"Most everyone has heard of Pablo Escobar of the Medellin Cartel. One of the largest drug smuggling cartels in the world. What you may not have known is that the story of Escobar has been made into a riveting Netflix 10 episode, series.

Pablo Escobar is played so superbly by Wagner Moura. This is a man so snarky and deadly, he does not blink in killing women and children. But, this same man has such a great love for his wife, mother and two children. I found myself almost cheering Escobar on. What was I thinking?

Two DEA agents have been sent to track Escobar down. Steve Murphy played. by Boyd Holbrook and Javier Pena, played by Pedro Pascal, are the two agents. All three of these men deserve awards for their characters, but Moura, especially, is riveting. Turning from a madman at times into a loving husband and father is akin to Jekyll and Hyde.

We follow Escobar as he builds his empire. Through his troubles and turmoils, he has many followers who love him and would follow him to the ends of the earth. Money is the root of all evil, and  is significant in this series. The photography and filming are brilliant, the direction superb. Accolades all around. One of the most surprising scenes is Escobar's escape from his prison, or playhouse, as it seems. This series takes many liberties, but this is done to make the series more exciting and give us a more thorough view of the world I of drug smugglers, and the men hunting these smugglers down.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 09-17-16",1474070400,3,1503,4.593283582089552

7771525,3,B01H1VSVME,"The Upside: After two viewings of this show I found that it was well written, directed, shot and acted.  If you like crime stories you might find this show very entertaining.  So why only 3 stars?
The Downside:  The producers of Narcos decided that the Spanish specking characters should speak Spanish.  The problem is that since about 95% of the show is set in South America about 90% of the dialog is in Spanish with English subtitles.  At time the actors are rattling off the dialog faster than the automatic weapon in their hands.  This has two downsides.  1.  Youre constantly having to rewind the disc and/or hitting pause to read whats being said.  2.  Because you're reading the dialog you end up missing the emotion and action depicted on the screen.
I can only hope that NETFLEXs  and the producers either change this approach or springs a little extra cash to offer up a second mostly English soundtrack for season 2.",1473465600,,928,4.666666666666667
7771526,5,B01H1VSVME,"Even though this should be obvious (being about drug Cartels and all)..... I'd like to say that this show is NOT FOR KIDS.

NARCOS the series feels like what we would have gotten if Martin Scorsese was directing a TV series about Scarface, instead of a Brian De Palma Movie.  The difference is that  Narcos S1 is not about a Cuabn Drug Lord, but rather the story of the rise of Pablo Escobar as Columbia's Drug Kingpin.

If you are a fan of realistic crime dramas then you should enjoy this as it feels as real as it can get.  In case you didn't know Pablo Escobar really existed.  It is based on actual events (although a lot is changed or was added in for Dramatic effect) and its a show that has everything playing in the Grays instead of it being Black & White.

It is a show that is addicting, and most people that did watch on Netflix  ""Binge-Watched"" it.  The actors/actresses were fantastic.  Wagner Moura, who plays Pablo is a Brazilian actor who really put in the hard work to have the proper Columbian sounding Spanish leave his lips.  He transforms himself into the role, and he is as ruthless on screen as Pacino was in Scarface.  He is also as charismatic as Pacino was in Scarface, so some people may have a problem with that.  I don't think the message of the show is to glorify Pablo Escobar, but rather to entertain you with two sides of a Chess board with very high stakes.

Wagner is just excellent, and I can't fault the show for having that excellence  shine through.

Even though I can still stream this on NETFLIX w/my already paid subscription, I am buying this.  Must own in my opinion.",1473292800,,1612,4.391891891891892
7771527,5,B01H1VSVME,"Season one is very interesting.  This is a show that you need to devote attention to and not multitask; don't check statuses or surf the interwebs.  Why?  Because there are a lot of subtitles to be read, and if you miss those and don't speak Spanish, you might as well turn the show off and go about your business.  I didn't know a great deal about the shows lead character, Pablo Escobar, aside from little snippets from comparative articles and The War on Drugs campaign.

This series is set in the 1980s and chronicles the life of the Colombian drug lord, Pablo Escobar.  Although it is understood throughout the season that Escobar began his life of crime at an early age, we pick up his story as he begins to really explode and become one of the  richest men in the world. He accomplishes this by supplying the majority of the worlds cocaine (estimated around 80%). Starting from a lower class family, from Medellin, he would end up clearing over $400 Million a week.

In all, this is very well done - solid cinematography and actors. I'm looking forward to Season 2",1472774400,2,1071,4.541666666666667
7771528,4,B01H1VSVME,"Narcos: Season One follows the true story of the rise of the 1980s international cocaine cartels and the battle waged by law enforcement to stop them. At the center of the conflict are the notorious Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura) and the two DEA agents sent to take him down: Steve Murphy (Boyd Holbrook) and Javier Pena (Pedro Pascal).

This ten-part Netflix series allows time for deep characterization. Its chilling to see how calmly Mouras Escobar inquires about the families of Colombian police officers, an implied death threat if the cops interfere with his drug shipments. Using not only veiled threats, but outright bribery and murder, Escobar continues to run his lucrative drug business. By contrast, the good guys are far less colorful. Holbrooks Murphy is a bland, by-the-book agent in the style of Eliot Ness. Pascals Pena has more fire and is more interesting. Character actor Luis Guzman co-stars as murderous cartel boss Gascha.

Rather than portraying Escobar as a one-note villain, the show explores his early life and the conditions that led to his rise in the illegal drug trade. He has compassion for the poor, tries his hand at politics, balances family life with an extra-marital affair, and orders assassinations as easily as ordering a rum and Coke. Previous large and small-screen portrayals of Escobar have never delved as deeply.

Bonus extras on the 3-disc Blu-ray release include four making-of featurettes, deleted scenes, and audio commentaries. A digital HD copy is included.",1471824000,6,1530,5.186234817813765
7771529,5,B01H1VSVME,"This was made for Netflix  where I watched it  and is based on the life of Pablo Escobar. I have read and seen a fair bit about the man and this follows the facts as portrayed in the Colombian documentary Los Tiempos de Pablo Escobar and to say what happens is stranger than fiction is a massive understatement. It takes us along for the ride with Escobar and his cronies starting to realise that Colombia was a failing state and money talks. In his case it screamed and the US soon realised what was happening on its doorstep  only they were a bit late to the party.

By the time they caught up with him he had becomes numero uno in the drugs World. His power and influence gave him plenty of ideas too and they are all depicted here. It is a fair depiction of him as a man  presenting him as human and incredibly ruthless, cynical and downright nasty.

The production values are extremely high and the acting is just superb. Escobar is played by the excellent Wagner Moura who is actually Brazilian but speaks Spanish here like a native. He has been in so many brilliant films including Elite Squad where he was seriously fit so must have attacked the pasta to gain the weight needed for this role. He is ably supported by a cast where even the bit players are outstanding. We have the stories of the brave men and women who went after him too and to say this makes for excellent TV is like saying cocaine can be a tiny bit addictive, and just like Charlie this too had me hooked after one hit  I shall stop gushing now, but also I have not met a single person who did not rave about this and there are plans for a second season which I hope is very soon indeed.",1466553600,12,1664,4.246835443037975

8764408,5,B01H1VSVME,"No idea why I took so long to get around to this given the lead actor, director and most of the crew worked on the terrific Elite Squad movies which feature high tension thrilling drug gangs vs. cops only set in Brazil's favelas rather than here in Colombia of the 1980s. What is brilliant is the way the series uses actual news footage from the time intercut with the drama. Most of us know the level of violence associated with the Columbia drug cartels was way off the charts insane back in the '80s and early '90s and this series does not disappoint in showing that.

Although Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar is terrific every time I saw him appear I kept thinking he looked so much like Porky Pig with a moustache that it distracted me a bit. I'm not kidding when you see him shot from some angles. His mom in the series also looked like a Latin American version of Tootsie with that hairdo and giant Elton John glasses.

Did not dig the voiceover narration by the US DEA agent Steve Murphy and also, if this was true, why would the DEA send an agent down to Latin America who doesn't speak Spanish? Although his partner, Javier Pena, speaks fluent Spanish so maybe that's why. Pena is played by Pedro Pascual who is really a scene stealer. You may recognize him from Game Of Thrones for playing another scene-stealing role of Oberyn Martel from the island of Dorne who gets killed in a trial by combat in Season 4.

The extras on the DVD are great with typical commentary tracks for some episodes, trailers and three decent looks behind the scenes especially the ones about all the specific Colombian locations shoots and the reason the series opted for a sort of standardized Spanish throughoyt rather than nailing the regional dialects perfectly.

Can't wait to start in on Season 2.
Season 1, FYI, takes us up to the point where Pablo Escobar escapes from fancy prison he has built for himself (watch the series and you'll see what it's all about).",1519948800,,1955,4.529745042492918
