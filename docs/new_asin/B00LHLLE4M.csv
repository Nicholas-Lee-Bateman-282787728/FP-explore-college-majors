8666004,5,B00LHLLE4M,"We don't see too many ballet treatments of the story of the marriage of Roman Emperor Nero and Poppea, a story of love and murder. This modern ballet uses a variety of music from the early Baroque to the ultra modern. There are some unusual elements, such as a narrator(all spoken parts are in German with a bit of French with selectable subtitles) and a video screen in the upper rear of the stage. But the best part of this production is the choreography and dancing which is bright, fresh and interesting, even for those who have traveled the dance path for many years as I have. The dancing is lively with plenty of solos, PDDs along with other group arrangements. The style comes close to classical with all the usual modernisms necessary for the ballet of today. There is no dancing on pointe, though, but some of the choreography could easily accommodate it. There is a bit of comedy that comes through in the choreography as well as more dramatic moments. There are also some moments of female topless nudity, but it isn't pushed in your face, er, well, you know what I mean. Christian Spuck's choreography has a refreshingly distinct and active style. There is also a nice five minute ballet miniature included as bonus material. This DVD should appeal to all lovers of modern ballet.",1409529600,3,1293,4.675438596491228
