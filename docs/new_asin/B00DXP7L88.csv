5863048,1,B00DXP7L88,"Like in Six Feet Under, Michael C. Hall overstayed his welcome.  Both series should have stopped two seasons earlier.  6 & 7 were, in parts, excrutiatingly bad.  You realise you shouldn't have persevered with the purchase when in moments of orchestrated terror, you can no longer stop yawning.  The writing was, in parts, execrable, the plot did not strain but snapped credibility.  Not wishing to spoil the denouement, the Captain does not have CCTV installed in her property, Dexter drugs and kidnaps victims, who know he is after them, in broad daylight.  An able poisoner fails to poison properly, etc.  Stop watching now if you wish to say you enjoyed the show.",1379116800,8,666,4.892857142857143
5863049,3,B00DXP7L88,"Over the years I have noticed that most TV shows seem to start weakening a bit after 7 seasons.
This is not a criticism of the writers, I simply think it is difficult to keep an interesting flow going with a given set of characters and general premise.

Dexter is no different.
I am writing this review with only 2 episodes left in the Series Finale.
(I will most likely need to update when the DVD ships to make comments on that aspect of it).

Dexter Season 8 starts very good, but fades from mid season on to close to absurd.
However the acting is superb.

BUT .... you can feel the writers were struggling to wrap up the Dexter universe and as a result the general storyline feels a bit ""forced"" this season.

I don't want to risk writing any spoilers, but some of Dexter's decisions don't seem in character and are more to help end the story arc.

The re-appearance of some older characters from past seasons also seem to lack continuity as past events are easily dismissed or ignored in the new relationships that are formed.

There are some plot holes that are unusual for the clever writing that has historically been part of this show.

It seems at times that character personalities have been changed to forcibly fit this SERIES FINALE.

You will note that despite this, I still gave a 3` Star review.

You get the feeling the writers were starting to run out of ideas and may have been happy to end the series now instead of being challenged to keep the quality high for another 2,3,4+ seasons. That or they were fighting with each other on how to end the series and never came to a good agreement.

Everybody likes to go out on a high note.
A boxer wants to retire stilling holding the title.
A TV show likes to say goodbye when the quality is still high and the ratings are still good.

It is unpleasant and sometimes sad to see something outlive it's quality of life.

Personally I hate to see DEXTER leave the air.
My wife and I have really liked the characters.
So I might personally like to see DEXTER go on and on ""forever"".

But the logical part of my mind understands why it is probably artistically best for the show to exit now while it is still riding high and not die a whimpering death of mediocrity.

As it is, the last few episodes suffer from some bad writing and very, very illogical actions on the part of Dexter that are not believable, make no sense, and seem to just be an excuse to create problems for our characters.

I won't say too much except it is the same old ..........""Dexter hesitates doing what he knows is the smart thing to do and somebody suffers ""........  plot device they have used in 5 of the 8 seasons.
But this time, it is so badly and obviously used many fans will say the show ""jumped the shark"".

All in all -- I don't want to criticize the hard work and great acting talents that go into making a show like this , BUT ..... Dexter should have had a better written season for his final farewell.",1379030400,3,2951,4.346083788706739
5863050,5,B00DXP7L88,"clarification and update: while finishing up this show i also am finishing up BREAKING BAD. i had to decide whether to compare this show to that one.  BB is perhaps the best tv show bar none.  if i were to write tv reviews comparing every one to BB, nothing would probably get over 4 stars again. so this review in no way is saying i like this show as much as BB.  however, DEXTER has held up for me personally over the past seasons.  I've always looked forward to it and enjoyed it. i am even a huger fan of the novels but it is a doomed prospect comparing novels with visual media.  they are apples and oranges. my original review follows.

there are some viewers of dexter who have been hugely disappointed with some seasons of this show,  i have not. i also read the novels, which are very different from the show.  they are much more comic. i also have no problem with the novels.  so if you are someone who has been very up and down with dexter, i may not be the reviewer for you.

in my opinion, this is overall a satisfying conclusion to the Dexter series.  Front and center throughout this last season are Dexter, Deb, the ghost of Harry, their father, AND the shrink who oversaw Harry's development of the code, played by Charlotte Rampling.  She treats both Dexter and Deb!

As we open, Deb is an absolute mess from having killed LaGuarda at the conclusion of last season. she has quit the force, is drinking and taking drugs, is working free lance for an investigative firm, etc.,  Dexter is desperate to fix her but of course he is the source of her problem and she can now barely stand the sight of him.  with this set up we are off and running while also tying up the supporting characters on the series, like Vince, Angel and others.

the success of this show largely depends on the acting jobs of michael c. hall and jennifer carpenter as dexter and deb.  if they were in any way weak, the entire series would flounder.  it is good Hall recovered from his bout with cancer as i can't see anyone else taking over the Dexter role from him.

some are upset at how this show concludes.  it would not fit the novels at all as the novels are comedic whereas the tv show has always been solely dramatic.  the show is also more morally oriented than the novels. this often happens in tv and film adaptations of novels, unfortunately. so this is a highly moral conclusion to the Dexter story. perhaps someday the Dexter series will be remade to fit with its novels. if so, the actor would have to be highly comedic, which i doubt describes michael c. hall as dexter.  with the dexter which was reinvented for the tv screen, he did the best job he possibly could.

5863051,5,B00DXP7L88,"...to drowning in pure darkness.

It's been six months since Debra murdered LaGuerta to save his brother. While Dexter is living the high life, free from all clouds of suspicion, Debra has quit the force and is now working as a bounty hunter.

Dexter's concluding words in the last season, ""We all make up our own rules"" takes centre stage.

With the one constant relationship, the one unconditional support in his life gone, Dexter's tenuous grip on familial support is gone. Dexter must step up to the plate lest his sister go off the deep end in more ways than a few.

The dark secrets behind Harry's Code are revealed. Dexter is fleshed out in profound, minute detail.

Perhaps the strongest component of this powerful finale are the sheer quantity of challenging moral dilemmas the characters and viewers are confronted with. Without spoiling anything, I'll simply finish by saying that there is more here than in a thousand introductory ethics classes.

This final season takes a sharp U-turn from episode 7, and the final episodes are more adrenaline-pumping than a dozen back-to-back Formula One championships. This blu-ray collection makes the perfect bookend for any Dexter fan.",1377561600,,1188,5.035714285714286

5863056,2,B00DXP7L88,"In my opinion, the first couple seasons of Dexter (with the exception of the third) were great. Starting at season 5, I started to notice that there has been a decline of quality. The sixth season was slightly better, but I hated the main killer. The seventh season got worse, and I basically lost hope in the series. Finally, after viewing  the first episode I finally thought the show got back on track. The episodes after that varied in my critical reaction, but overall it has been I pretty good season. I am writing this right after viewing the sixth episode, I have a good feeling the remainder of the series will stay good.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just finally got to watching the finale, and I can say that the final couple episodes where just awful.. and the finale was just disgraceful to the show.

5863057,5,B00DXP7L88,"It is difficult to believe that this is the 8th season of DEXTER and sad to know that the series ends with this season. The show has come a long way in sophistication of writing and quality of guest starts.  Most of the main characters are still present - Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas, Desmond Harington, James Remar, C.S, Lee and Aimee Garcia - but in the wake of the last season climax when Debra murdered LaGuerta in front of Dexter, Debra has a strong case of the fall-a-parts, turning to alcohol and pills until the intervention of an odd psychologist Dr Vogel (Charlotte Rampling, as splendid as ever), who knows Dexter's history intimately, becomes involved in the increasingly bizarre events that create a push-pull relationship between Dexter and Debra.  Toss in some serial killers as twisted as any the writers have created and we're on our way for a terrifying rollercoaster ride.  Seems like this season is going to be the strongest yet.

Yes I was angry when they took Rida off the show by murdering her in the bathtub with their son in eer blood. That was messed up. But other than that, I thought it has a great story line, the actors are all great and believeable, the location Miami was breathtaking in most scenes (never been near  beach myself) and the special effects, blood, killings, etc all looked real....I would give this an A+ and if they made a season 9 I would most definitely be the first to watch it. Idky everyone has negative comments. I really enjoyed it. Thank you Michael C. Hall for given me a great show to watch.

Dexter & crew have a way of getting under your skin even if you're not on ""the table"".  I watched it off & on over the years, long before we could buy a season.  Was always stationed at a new place & keeping up with times & etc. was a bugger!  Just recently I got the ""free for a week, try it before you buy it"" on Amazon...wow, binge watching was never so good as seeing Dex & family in all the bloody (or cleansed?) glory that Dex is known for.
Stories have always been complex; c'mon, a serial killer that folks root for?  And they made it work, so well that they had to go to extreme lengths in ripping up the first tier characters...& we still kept coming back for more.

I don't know about you, but don't you miss Dex taking out the trash?  I do.
Kind of a shame that they didn't end up the happy murdering family down in Argentina...
Dex & crew were great while they lasted...such a great premise...

5863344,4,B00DXP7L88,"No spoilers for this season - minor spoilers (who is still alive) from prior seasons:

I loved the entirety of the Dexter series. Not always every plot detail, but I think part of the reason for that was that Dexter, so unlike so many other series, seemed to be almost entirely character driven, rather than plot driven. In the latter, characters do completely inexplicable things, because the writers are entirely focused on getting from plot point alpha to plot point omega without considering the characters POVs. In Dexter, the emphasis (I thought) was so inward and so much about who these characters are and how they change over 8 seasons that the plot arcs almost didn't need to make sense to the audience as long as they made sense to the characters. To me, it mattered when Dexter's narration did not match what I was seeing on the screen only because that was consistent with the character's epic detachment and numerous blind spots.

I watched the show straight through starting in August 2015 and managed to stay completely unspoiled right up until just before the end, when I internet-searched a guest star and one of the top links had a MASSIVE spoiler for the finale right there in the headline. Also prominent in the headlines were fans' fairly heavily negative reactions. If you have watched up until now and are wondering whether to continue, it depends.

If you're a completionist, yes, regardless of whether the ending feels satisfying to you, it is not so bad that it warrants boycotting, and it is definitely one version of the truth for these characters.

If you are attached to a particular outcome and have been watching for the plot, you might not like this season.

I was disappointed, but after reading various things around the inter webs, it was not for any of the ""normal"" reasons. There was a lot I DID like about the season -> it continued what I thought were the main themes of the series: (1) what is family, (2) who are we, really, as compared to who we think we are, (3) is forgiveness possible, (4) are there really lesser evils, and, if so, what are they, (5) how well do we know the people who are closest to us, and (6) how do we overcome those internalized negative parental voices. Some of those questions were answered in ways I didn't agree with, but I'm still glad I watched.

Lesser themes that continued through this season: Dexter's mommy issues, Deb's daddy issues, antagonists who fit within a family archetype, and the tendency to start down a plot path only to wrap it up fast in the next episode and never speak of it again.

What I did not like about the season  - sometimes it seemed like the writers had never watched the show - not even during this season. Key facts about characters were completely forgotten. Also, I hated the end. It was a defensible answer to what I saw as the main questions of the series. But it wasn't the answer I wanted.",1444867200,2,2904,4.603481624758221

5863379,1,B00DXP7L88,"A horrible, terribly written joke of a final season, and the season finale even topped that.  Here is why the writers should themselves become victims of a TV writers serial murderer.

So, Hannah suddenly turned into a good mom, forgot how to poison people, and earned the love of Harrison (as well as sleep-walking through her role the entire second half of the series she appeared in - although I guess she was happy to get a paycheck).  As for LeGuerto and Doakes, the hell with them.  They got what they deserved.  Really?

Oh, and the writers couldn't figure out how to end the damned thing so they conveniently had Deb suffer a stroke while in recovery after being shot so they could write a real tear-jerker ending.  Oh, and Dexter motored into the heart of a Level 3 Hurricane (Hurricane Laura, for whatever the name meant), and somehow he miraculously survived and ended up in a logger's camp kind of looking like Walter White - perhaps he was cooking crystal meth with the writers?

Oh, and the Federal Marshall's service always sends one guy to investigate a serial murderer.

Oh, and who cares about all the innocents killed by Hannah.  She had learned to become a good Mom.

Oh, and even though Dexter killed a serial murderer while in custody, doing something he had no business doing, it was a good thing so let him go.

I could go on and on and on and on....this was a terrible series after Seasons 1 and 2.  Not in the same league as The Sopranos (irrespective of that bad finale) and certainly not Breaking Bad (best finale ever).

And why wouldn't Dexter go to Argentina - because he'd bad for people's karma?  Duh.",1437004800,,1634,4.5479452054794525

5863404,5,B00DXP7L88,"The final season of Dexter brings the series to a close.  The series continues with the Dexter as Serial Killer/Superhero theme.  (By day Dexter is a mild mannered lab tech & by night he is an avenging hero righting wrongs and saving the world while dealing with inner angst.)  In this season, the comic book, X-Men style back story appears with Dr Vogel (Charlotte Rampling) who plays an excellent creepy, mad-scientist type of Psychologist. We learn later that she worked with Harry to help him channelize and control Dexter's urge to kill into a moral framework.

This of course, is also the last season so Dexter finds his new replacement, Zach Hamilton (Sam Underwood) and he links up again with Hannah McKay.  In fact, Dexter has the opportunity to start a new life.  Dexter, Hannah, and Harrison decide to head to Argentina to leave their sordid past.  This season's super villain is Oliver Saxon (Darri Ingolfsson).  This psychopathic killer has a dark connection to Dr. Vogel and his target is Dexter.  Another person hunting Dexter-or more really-Hanna is Jacob Elway (Sean Patrick Flanery).  Elway is an ex-cop Private Investigator who is looking to score the big reward money for Hannah's capture.

There is excellent acting on the part of all the characters, especially Jennifer Carpenter, who plays the traumatized, nervous breakdowned Deborah Morgan very well.

There must be some remarks for the controversial last episode.  This reviewer was pretty satisfied with the ending.  It was suspenseful and perfectly matched how the characters would likely end up.  Even Dexter the lumberjack was perfect, especially with the last, dark expression on his face.",1432857600,,1670,5.11070110701107

I truly feel the show end the way it was suppose to end and I am not doing any spoilers for people out there who have yet to watch the final season of Dexter.  Now yes I do agree some of the characters in the final season and writing was a bit off and made me go really this is best you can write or come up with.  But from the idea of a whole set and this indivual episodes I feel the show Dexter was an amazing show and enjoyed every season and lots of guess stars.  I say this watch the whole show from season one threw eight with an open mind and open heart and in essance and in a strange way show do a full circle from the point of view of main charcter Dexter.

5863481,5,B00DXP7L88,"Dexter is a character that is easy to fall in love with. Both well-written and well acted, this may be the first serial killer you have ever rooted for. This series is about a vigilante serial killer who chooses to use his ""darkness"" for good...killing only people who do bad things (usually people who have somehow gotten away with murder). The story line over the entire series is about Dexter's quest to fit in and feel ""normal"" despite his unusual secret. He is a blood splatter analyst for the Miami police department, where his sister is also a homicide detective. Both of which make for an interesting show.

All of the writing and acting is exceptional in this series for both lead and supporting characters. It has action, suspense and comedy, and one of the characters uses alot of profanity (which strangely enough is an endearing part of her character and part of the comedic aspect). It is not derogatory or offensive to any certain group, but if you are unable to appreciate artfully strung together four-letter words and other combinations thereof, you may not like at least a line or two of the scenes that character is in.

Considering this series is about a serial ""killer"" who is obsessed with blood, it really isn't a gory series at all. I would say that the suspense and drama are balanced with a light-heartedness that makes it easy to watch. Not so much for the kiddies, obviously, but most adults will find this show enjoyable.",1424822400,3,1451,4.708661417322834

I just kept  thinking to myself please find your way back to each other! It was very satisfying to finally see Dexter show some real emotions about his relationship with Deb, and for him to realize that he needed and loved her just as much as she did him. The introduction to Dr. Vogel was great, I feel like she brought some much need  closure about Dexters origins that helped him ultimately feel connected to the world. I liked the idea of Dex mentoring Zack Hamilton. It was a promising storyline that  should have been followed through with. It was very shocking that the brain surgeon turned out to be Vogel's son, but he was not the most dynamic serial killer of all the seasons. Hated what happen to Dr. Vogel. The end had me in tears, although I hated Deb's character initially, she really grew on me and I hated to see her be killed off the way she was. Although the overall entertainment value is 4 stars they could have delivered a better ending with more closure for all the characters. I really hated Hannah Mckay and don't think she should have ended up with Harrison, they could have done wayyy better than the whole Hannah Mckay thing. Overall this kept me guessing , entertained, and on a roller coaster of emotions. The actors are all very good , so it was very easy to forgive some of the poorly thought out plots.

At its best, this rivaled Hitchcock in his prime, especially in the 4th season where Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan squared off against Johh Lithgow's Trinity Killer.  This was one show where everyone wondered how it would end, surely there was no finale that would satisfy all of us fans.

Well, the writers proved us right when they gave us a climax that pleased no one, and at the time of it original showing, the fury of diehard DEXTER fans burned up social media; now over a year later, I can say that it is still a most unsatisfying conclusion, especially compared to the way Vince Gilligan ended the saga of Walter White (a similar character to Dexter Morgan) on BREAKING BAD.

Many fans were most displeased with the entire final season, and I can see their point, starting with the Big Bad-the Brain Surgeon-who turns out to be the most bland of all of Dexter's foes, a psycho right out of Script Writing 101.  I think when they started this season, the writers only had the vaguest notion of how they wanted to end it all, for it appears they changed directions several times, abruptly terminating promising story lines and interesting new characters such as Charlotte Rampling's Dr. Vogel and Sam Underwood's Zach Hamilton.  Ynonne Starhovski's Hannah is brought back, mainly, I thought, because she is really easy on the eyes.  I thought the dynamic that developed in mid season between Dexter, Hannah, Vogel and Zach was the best thing about this season and had lots of promise, especially the prospect that Zach would become Dexter's protege and continue his work and Harry's Code.  Instead the show went for a resolution that could be best be described as rote, ending in a final, utterly improbable, scene with Dexter living the life of a lumberjack.  I think they were determined to leave the door open at least a crack to the possibility of bringing Dexter back at some point in some form.

The burning question through all of the past seasons was would Dexter's secret life as a serial killer finally be exposed?  And what would be the reactions of all of his co-workers in Miami Metro be when this came to light?  This was what all those previous seasons seemed to have been building toward, yet it was just not to be.  In the end, they simply did not know what to do with the character of Dexter, was he a villain or an anti-hero?  Or maybe Harry and Dr. Vogel had been wrong all those years ago, maybe he hadn't really been a psychopath all along, merely the victim of a very bad diagnosis.  All more interesting possibilities than what we got.

Plausibility was never a problem for the writers-there were way too many just in the nick of time arrivals and escapes by the skin of their teeth plot twists, but the one thing they got right was character development, especially the outstanding supporting players, many of whom had more than a few shades of gray themselves; Lauren Velez's late Lt. LaGureta being a prime example.  C.S. Lee, Aimee Garcia, Geoff Pierson, Desmond Harrington where all as fully realized characters as the main protagonist. Wasn't James Remar's Ghost Dad Harry a cherry acting gig? And David Zayas's Angel Batista is definitely on my list of favorite TV cops. Somebody needs to give him his own show.

Then there was Jennifer Carpenter's Deb, whose character could always charitably be described as shrill; like many fans, she really got on my nerves over the years, but again, I think this is the fault of the writers, who in too many cable dramas seem to create leading female characters whose only job is to whine and snap at the protagonist, not unlike Anna Gunn's Skylar White or Kelly McDonald's Margaret Schroeder on BOARDWALK EMPIRE; shows that also had difficult leading male characters.

In the end, I hope Hannah and Harrison are happy in Argentina, and Sam Underwood did get continue the work he started on DEXTER, when he played an even crazier pair of psycho twins on THE FOLLOWING, a show that would not be on the air if not for DEXTER.

And all final praise to Michael C. Hall for making us truly care about a killer who butchered people (bad people) like they were cattle in a slaughter house; the one good thing I can say about that final scene is that he stayed true to the show at the end when he makes eye contact with the audience, reminding the viewers one last time that it was us he had been confiding in along.",1421020800,,4665,4.571942446043166

5863541,3,B00DXP7L88,"So, you expected this lame show to end dramatically? Suddenly the writers were to become something more than they were throughout the series? The mere fact that they thought of Debra Morgan falling in love with her own half brother should have shown you how limited they were to begin with. So, somehow Dexter's boat is destroyed by the ocean and the oncoming hurricane but he lives on and shows up on in some north western logging town. I mean, how many times was Dexter cornered with no way out but he and an accomplice still managed to elude the police. So you can't swallow the stupid finale but yet you swallowed everything else? I mean how much stupidly did we all have to wade through to get to the stupid finale. We had the ice truck killer. We had the trinity killer. We had the end of times killer. We had the poisoner fem fatal. We had Dexter and his ""dark passenger"", and the writers ran this into the ground. So where did the series grow stale for you? For me the series was stupid from the beginning. Yeah, it was marginally entertaining but the show always seemed to be at least 15 minutes longer than it should be with so much stupid narration and lame dialogue. I appreciate the dark edge of the show which was often more than I wanted, and the show was usually a lot cruder than I wanted it to be. The show was always crude like a Showtime series. So I guess we got what we all expected. And I still don't know if Michael C. Hall is a good actor of if he just gets by with his looks. I guess I'll just have to watch something else like with him in it like Nip Tuck or that funeral home show. I have to say the guy has creeped me out more than once in a show, so maybe the guy can actually act.",1419638400,,1711,4.156626506024097

Unfortunately, The Final Season of ""Dexter"" will probably be held up for future generations of writers and showrunners as an object lesson in how not to conclude a series.

Sloppy and poorly-written, with so many logical lapses as to infuriate even the most casual viewer, the Final Season is a tough slog.

Characters that used to act now just talk -- endlessly -- about what they should or should not do. Complexity and nuance are nowhere to be found. But the Final Season's cardinal sin may be that it is just plain boring. It feels like everyone is sleepwalking through a slow-motion trainwreck.

Wish I had heeded the reviews and skipped this season, so that I could remember the once-fascinating ""Dexter"" more fondly.

Outside of a few areas where the writers seemed to speed along and skip depictions (like you knew it was going to happen but didn't get to see it as bingo it was over and done with and maybe that was to speed up the tempo--not sure), the Season tied up Dexter's story into a nice package. You got a conclusion to almost everyone who had been major players all the past seasons. It actually was very good, made sense why Dexter ended up where he was. And someone called him a ""lumberjack"" in their review...being married to a former logger (proper name) it is log truck driver or logger. I think lumberjack is a term from the 19th century.

The final season did have a lot to live up to - season 7 was very consistent and that finale was absolutely heartbreaking and shocking.
Yes, I have to admit that the first half of the season was a bit slow, and it seemed like it was going nowhere; but once Hannah was reintroduced, it found its pace again, and then it kept going strong until the very end.
I was very moved by the ending. It is a testament to the writers' skill of coming up with such amazing three-dimensional characters which you care about. I knew ""it"" had to happen, but I was very sad when it did.
And about Dexter's last scene-- I think it's interesting, his choosing of that fate for himself. It's probably harsher than it would've been otherwise. He's really evolved. But the door... remains open.",1410048000,,1043,4.409326424870466

5863687,4,B00DXP7L88,"**SPOILER ALERT**

I appreciate what the writers/producers tried to do with this season. The two main characters, Dexter and Deb, both had to deal with the consequences of their actions regarding each other over their entire lives, and it was a very rocky road. As we've seen Dexter become more emotional and fatherly and loving, his change over this season was not so jarring. But Deb has only recently become aware of who her brother really is, and has had a tough time dealing with her complicity in his crimes. Jennifer Carpenter did a great job with her character this year, plumbing the depths of despair and confusion, questioning many of her major life choices.

This is really Deb's season. Her psyche suffers from her actions protecting her brother, and she waffles between continuing her protection and ending his life or her connection to him. The addition of Dr. Vogel as psychiatrist to both Deb and Dexter was a clever idea. You never feel entirely at ease with Vogel, as she seems more curious and revelatory about Dexter and Zach as concepts rather than as people needing treatment. She's willing to encourage them to pursue deadly activities, but her own deeply psychotic son must be kept alive and receive treatment.

By the end of the season we have Deb cheerfully offering up a serial killer for Dexter to handle ""his way,"" and Dexter not killing him so that Deb can handle him ""her way."" Both of them are guilty of keeping feet in ""both worlds,"" which leads to tragic consequences neither of them could predict because they are too unfamiliar with their sibling's code.

I thought Dexter might just weigh himself down with Deb's corpse and take the plunge into the stormy sea, but I'm glad they showed him in the final scene. You wonder exactly what he's thinking as he looks out the window, then forces himself to turn away and concentrate on what's in front of him.",1409184000,,1889,4.732522796352583

Episodes rambled, they were boring and barely moved the simplistic plot along.

The holes in the plot were big enough to drive a truck through.  I won't list any spoilers here, but for anyone who's seen it, the stuff he did in the hospital would not have happened.

5863781,3,B00DXP7L88,"Or, it was the worst of Deb, it was the tolerable Deb.

I have watched 7 episodes of this season so far and like many here, I was going to give this season 1 or 2 stars. The reason? By far, my least favorite character is Deb. My second least favorite character is any man that is infatuated with Deb that particular season/episode and puts up with all her crap. Dexter included. I just can not stand her. If anything, she is more narcissistic than Dexter is and by far. Add to the fact she is a major drama queen and you have the perfect mixture of someone I will dislike. I think the actress does a fantastic job of making me hate her so much which made me in a perverse way like seeing Deb on screen.

Until this year. OMG, this year she is like normal Deb on steroids the first half of the season and she was getting as much or even more face time as Dexter was getting. Every single thing I hate about her is multiplied by ten as we watch her struggle with how season 7 ended. And you guessed it. How it affects her. All the while crying, ""Look what you did to me Dexter."" It's never her fault that something goes wrong with her life. It's the fault of another character, usually Dexter, why she is the way she is and she makes sure that persons knows it by lashing out at them with her potty  mouth. By the third episode if it wasn't for my almost phobia like need to finish any book/tv show I start, I would have quit watching season 8 right there. So for 3 more episodes I get to watch Deb B.....ch, moan and complain her way through life. Wondering why EVERYTHING that goes wrong is about her. Watching Dexter,with the patients of Jobe, kiss her tuckus not matter how foul mouthed and evil spirited she is towards him. Watching and wondering why certain men are infatuated with this train wreck of a woman. Normal Deb, this makes for an interesting character that is very possibly more screwed up than Dexter is. Steroid Deb, for me any way, is basically unwatchable. I am not exaggerating that I would cringe every time she was on screen, Which was very often becuase the first 6 episodes could have been called ""Debbie"" instead of Dexter.

I knew I really hated Deb this year but it wasn't until the 7th episode or around there when I realized her character was making me hate the whole show. Thats when she finally came to grips with her latest drama and reverted back to ""normal "" Deb. Like a light switch, at this time I started enjoying the show again.

I have no idea if the other things mentioned by other viewers will make me hate the season again or not as I haven't seen it yet. I do know one spoiler I read here will only make me enjoy the show more and that moment can't come soon enough.i wonder if any one can guess what that spoiler is. LOL.

The underlying theme through all 8 seasons is whether Dexter is a natural-born sociopath/serial murderer or was created due to a horrific experience as a very young child. Is there a real human heart beating beneath the murderous impulses--a feeling, caring human being that can ultimately be trained to reassert itself? That is the question that is lived explored through all 8 seasons. I was utterly fascinated by this show--highly recommended, though not for the faint of heart.",1396137600,,659,4.945945945945946

There was some confusion on the killer was thought to have been killed earlier and it turned out to be another person and they did not address this at all, but I could tolerate all this.

So here comes the final episode.  They didn't have much to do for the final episode.  The next to last episode ended great, but I guess the writers are attention deprived pansies who have to ""shake things up"" in the end.  So what do these guys do?  It was fine half way through but in the last 20 minutes or so they kill off a main character, and then change the ending completely.  There's nothing wrong with guessing how it will end and getting it right.  The writers just HAD to make it so that no one would have guess how it would end.  There's a reason no one guessed how it would end: IT SUCKED!  I have watched this show from season 1 and feel like this was a cheap way for it to go out.

The snarky voiceover explaining Dexter's inner motives lent a lighter, even comic underpinning to help you endure the violende.  Unfortunately that technique is obviously missing and the flimsy plot and new characters are forced and formulaic.  Old characters are pulled too thin and their circumstances and situations are too contrived; Dexter's escapades are sloppy and it's hard to suspend disbelief.  With all of that negativity aside, I'm a devout fan who has followed this smart, deftly profound character 'til the end. Guess you have to stick with a good friend.",1395705600,,659,5.247619047619048

Each show I found myself questioning an aspect of the plot and found what I perceived to be lazy writing. They ended it horribly. How they chose to close Deb and Dexter's characters was just atrocious. *Spoiler Alert ahead*. It looks like they found themselves unable to give Dexter a happy ending and, well, they almost ruined the whole show with how they did it. Dexter was never ever in true danger the whole season yet the cover art makes it look like he is. And the whole star rating system is flawed. 3.5 stars for this season is way too high. 3.5 makes it seem like this is worth watching. Its not. It may be 3.5 stars compared to all shows that have ever been created, but this is close to 1 star if we are basing the rating system on just this series.

I've read that Hall got cancer and divorced from ""Deb"" (they were married in real life) in the same year in 2010, so I sort of understand them wanting to wrap this show up, but, honestly, I wish they never made this season.

And did anyone else get tired of Dexter's dad popping up with his bad advice? Hey Pops, shut your piehole and go haunt Charlie Manson in the slammer.",1393804800,7,669,4.403225806451613

5863850,1,B00DXP7L88,"The only reason to see this season of Dexter is to witness the horrors that bad writing can inflict on a beloved television series.  Without adding spoilers, I will mention only a few of the idiocies this season embraces:

It dumbs down key characters and has them acting out of character.  Batista, for example.

It fails to utilize interesting characters and introduces foolish characters for NO REASON.  Masuka's daughter, anyone?

It leaves key questions and tensions and mysteries unanswered and un-approached.  La Guerta's dead.  Oh well.  Nothing fishy there.

It turns Dexter into an absolute fool.  The final episode is a disgrace.  Something one would expect to see on a parody of Dexter on SNL.

The writers must have been hooked on History Channel's Ax-Men during the writing of this season.

To say that this season was unfulfilling is like saying that starving children in Africa are kind of hungry.  It is a disgrace.  The first few episodes had the potential to lead us into quite a complex and interesting conclusion to the Dexter phenomenon.  Unfortunately, it is all downhill after about episode 4.  Depending on who you talk to.

The actors are not at fault.  Perfect as always.  They were simply poor souls forced to go down with the ship.

Go to IMDB and see who the writers were for the last two seasons.  They ruined a masterpiece and should be avoided at all costs.",1392940800,5,1390,4.796610169491525

I agree that season 8 was disappointing for us long time fans. Many criticisms I've read are right on. But I haven't read much about one point I can't get past. Why on earth would Dexter dump Deb in the ocean? That's how he disposed of his victims. If Dexter truly loved anyone it was Deb. (Can't count Hannah) That felt like a slap in the face to us fans.

But, I gave this season with horrible writing 4 stars bc the series, as a whole, was that good....",1392940800,5,482,4.285714285714286
5863852,2,B00DXP7L88,"""Dexter: The Complete Final Season""
(HBO, 2013)

NOTE: mild spoilers below
. . .

In recent years, people have taken to incorrectly using the phrase ""jumping the shark"" about artists, shows, etc., when what they actually mean is ""started to suck."" I think it would be doubly wrong to use jumping the shark to describe the final season of HBO's ""Dexter"" because the verb ""jump"" implies a level of energy and commitment that is completely absent here. Everyone involved in the series seems to have just given up caring or trying -- for whatever reasons there's no depth, no humor, no subtlety or vigor left. The opening episodes are so badly written, so blunt and uninvolving, and the acting is so universally lifeless and uncommitted, you have to wonder just what kind of bad vibes were going on around the set.

It's rare to see a critically lauded show so completely flame out: ""Deadwood"" is the closest example I can think of, and I suppose there may be some similar ""fine...! if you're going to cancel us, we'll get you back!"" spitefulness at work. A pity. You'd think that artists would take more pride in their work and not deliver such sub-par material for their fans to suffer through at the end. Oh, well. We watched it, got some weak sense of closure, etc., were mostly pretty bored. (PS: I, for one, am glad they killed Deb off, although I wish they'd done it about four seasons earlier...) (Axton)",1392854400,,1408,4.646586345381526

5863854,5,B00DXP7L88,"By the time the 7th Season came around, I was completely disappointed in the writing and stories. There was a serial killer on every corner in Miami and the storylines had become outrageous.  The James Olmos/Hanks season was just plain stupid.  This final season really goes back to its roots and resolves the series in an unexpected but justified and satisfying way. Although the romantic relationship between Dexter and Deborah is not resolved, their deep love for each other (in whatever way it manifests itself) is completely realized.  The bond the two share is beyond any brother-sister or romantic relationship ever seen.  Love, love, love the ending.  It's second by a hair to Breaking Bad.  I didn't buy this season and now I regret it. This season is in line with seasons 1-4. Seasons 5, 6, & 7 went astray.  If I have my seasons correct, the last good one was the season with Styles.",1392768000,2,894,4.7290322580645165

The last season is where they clearly didn't know what to do. Dexter started to 'melt' and Hannah just became a distraction. While everyone seemed to 'love her' the writers did nothing to develop her character and her acting was less thrilling. She was a pretty face with no personality. I usually judge how good a show is by the ending... which is why I gave this show 3 stars. All in all, it could've been better.",1392681600,,559,4.6

5863868,2,B00DXP7L88,"Awful and disloyal to the fan base.  That's all you need to know about Dexter Final Season 8.  If you have watched the previous seasons, you will feel compelled to see how it all ends.  I heard about the poor reviews for a while and decided to forego the final season.  Then...I gave in.  I was such a huge fan of the show I just couldn't help it.  I'm sorry I did; I'm now left with a negative last impression of one of the era's most interesting shows.  Season 8 is shockingly bad.  And the final episode is lame beyond belief.  (And it's not just the writing/plot but also the directing: if Hanna has a $250k bounty on her head, maybe she should wear a hat and sunglasses when going out in public? It is sunny Florida after all--everyone has a hat and sunglasses on...just a thought).

The reviews here have turned into a forum for loyal fans to air our grievances.  And with good reason!  If you watch the opening credits, you'll notice that there appears to be an endless amount of ""executive producers"" (including the show's leading actor).  What exactly did these executive producers do except allow the writers to submit a final season devoid of any creativity?

With each season, the writers had the challenge of giving us a compelling season finale that could continue to the next season.  Here, the writers were free of constraints!  The possibilities endless.  And this is what they give us?!!  Why not just have Miami Metro attacked by terrorists in episode one and be done with it?

Maybe the pressure of a final season was too much?  Maybe the writing would have been better with constraints.  They could have taken the Sopranos approach and provided a finale that ""could have"" continued to a next season without trying to tie everything up in a neat little dark bow. Leave some plot lines to the audience's imagination.  Whatever...I'm starting to rant out of shear shock at how disappointing Season 8 was!

5863871,5,B00DXP7L88,"When death is treated so phantasmagorically it begs the question can I enjoy, like admire the attempt?  Amazingly my answer is yes. Almost like a fairy-tale. The characters are able to surround themselves in blood, gore, and chopped up body parts and continue eating, loving, and smiling. Well what does this say about the production?  Combined with all the horror is great acting, well written scripts using interior monologues and attractive Miami scenery. There were few moments of fill, usually no long drives, or waiting outsides someone's door. Action , and purpose driven by how the outcome would happen moves the script. On the whole it is a rousing 5 stars. Sadly the last hours except for the ending were stretched too far. The need to rush through got me. The ending was a shock but understandable. When a family is thrown into complete chaos by a gruesome murder there will be tragic consequences. Finally the series ends realistically and that is a shock.
  Psychologically the series  is  a symbolic portrayal of our collapsing culture. Or is our need for revenge, for the cultures lack of compassion, that I and others are able to get behind this series, and enjoy the anger that surely the murders represent. Great art should be  a cathartic experience. Experiencing the loss of family provokes a deadly, emotional turmoil.",1392076800,,1339,4.950892857142857

The answer is a resounding ""no"". Its always easier to criticize than to actually create, and the writers, directors, and actors did a phenomenal job closing out Dexter.

5863895,4,B00DXP7L88,"Ok, I know that's kind of harsh to say but here is how I see it: the ending was the ending and you can't change it. Yes, it upset me too. First of all, I think they should have ended it when he was going into the storm on the boat. None of the other junk afterwards. But it wasn't up to me. I don't think they should have showed him at the end with the logging company. Why? Because it is irritating that he left everything behind (that we knew he wanted like Hannah and Harrison) and now we have to see him alone and clearly miserable. It's annoying, yes, but there was a lot more behind it than that. We saw what happened to Deb. Dexter blamed himself for what happened to her because of his secret. He didn't want it to happened to the two people he loved-Hannah and Harrison. He wanted them to be safe and he knew they wouldn't be safe if he was here. He had already put Harrison in danger and Hannah, well, she isn't much better off. I think it could have gone into another season and it would have helped us understand why exactly he made the decision. His decision to ""end it all"" was rather sudden, especially considering he was about to join Hannah and Harrison in Argentina. But what can you do? The entire series was wonderful and well thought out. It had to end eventually. I have no read the books but I have heard that it followed them well. I plan on doing that after I collect all of the season. But really, although none of us liked how it ended, that's generally how it is. There are so many unanswered questions. Maybe they will never be answered or maybe we will get lucky and see more out of Dexter but who really wants that? It was great the way it was.",1391299200,,1675,4.156923076923077

5863908,4,B00DXP7L88,"The reason season 8 gets mediocre reviews is that too many people are comparing Dexter to Breaking Bad when they are entirely different shows. Dexter is psychological and focuses on suspense. Breaking Bad features an egomaniacal protagonist and way more action. Apples and oranges. Dexter's finale is bashed often because it didn't end the way viewers wanted it to end. (Sarcasm alert) Imagine that...an unpredictable finale...BOOOOOO! Who wants a conclusion that's open to interpretation? Spoon feed us a fairy tale ending or a ramboesque shoot-out please....God forbid we think or try to read between the lines! Dexter ended appropriately. Anything different would've been too sappy or too expected.

I see only 2 flaws with the final season. (1) The ""Brain surgeon"", Dexter's last obstacle, should've been more menacing. (2) It was odd that the writers tried to develop supporting characters with pointless side plots that in no way affected Dexter's journey (e.g. Mazuka's biological daughter finds him. Quinn's nomination for sargent and his relationship with the nanny) Dexter has always been about 1 character, hence its title. Michael Hall hogged the scenes for 7 years the same way Allen Iverson hogged the ball in Philly. There was no need to finally focus on character development so late in the game.

But it was nothing like the rest of the series.

The other disappointment is the way it ended - not at all what I would have preferred and really didn't make much sense to me. I don't get why Dexter would have made the final decision that he made, it is just not what he would have done.

I won't put any spoilers here. If you are a Dexter fan, of course you have to buy it just to see the outcome. While I think the ending is probably not ""wrong"", I do think the the writing of it (and hence, the leading up to the end) was pretty poor. The Federal Marshall's behavior is completely ridiculous for one thing - I mean, how does he buy that a nurse mistook Hannah for Deb and not follow up - or press for a better explanation? Harrison's fall on the treadmill.... Deb's discovery of Dexter in the Keys... Oliver Saxon's kill room scene in episode 11....Hannah doesn't even die her hair, wear sunglasses... Dex simply rolling a body-laden gurney out of the hospital to his boat... the airport....The Bus scene.......too many poorly written scenes /  things to overlook. Believable or not is not the point - writing is. Even though I am extremely disappointed, Dexter has had me hooked since the beginning. It still get's three stars from me. Probably deserves less. One way that I can relate this; if this had been the first season of Dexter, I probably would have not become a fan. In any case, I am going to miss this series....",1390521600,,1360,4.436

I have to admit I even cried a little. My best advice is to watch this season with a open mind and no expectations for the series finale. It was very surprising and dramatic, but very well done.

5863926,5,B00DXP7L88,"SPOILER ALERT

I think too many reviews on here are somewhat irrational in there assessment of basing an opinion on the whole season by what happened in the final episode.

If you take a step back and look at this whole season, I think it wrapped it up beautifully on the whole. Perhaps not the perfect ending but a great way to bring the story back to a full circle with the introduction of the steely-eyed Dr. Vogel (great actress for the role), Dexter's mother figure working in the shadows with his father.

This was a tense season and had some of the spark that the show unfortunately lost and never fully recovered after the brilliant and arguably best Season 4 with John Lithgow as Dexter's arch nemesis. It really took a nose dive and the subsequent seasons seemed serial killer soap operaish, especially with the more emphasis on Deb. Deb was a character I hated (annoying actress) but she served her purpose, to balance Dexter out.

The ending, although not the happy or everything fit like a puzzle ending of Breaking Bad, it was dramatic. I liked how Dexter being blinded by love and wanting to change a new leaf, made one of the few mistakes he would by not killing the Brain Doctor (puzzling since he could in retaliation reveal Dexter's true self to the police) which ultimately caused the death of his sister. This proved Vogel's claim that Dexter was once the ""perfect"" person, who was incapable of love or emotions which normally blinds an individual. She  grew concerned when she heard about the love in his life and saw his steel armor being slowly chipped away.

It's appropriate that Dexter would fall in love with Hannah. I can't imagine him falling for a normal civilian. He is after all a sociopath that is incapable of love. It took one of his own kind, someone he can fully relate with, to unravel and unwittingly bring him down.

As far as the future, I would like to imagine Dexter living near his son, watching over him from afar but never getting close to him to not mess up his life. This would ultimately be better than living with Hannah which would most likely prove destructive for both.

This season is far from perfect, there are too many plot holes. One glaring one being how Hannah manages to get herself on a plane to board an international flight to another country being a wanted fugitive. Aside from that, this is thoroughly enjoyable and I would rank this higher than all the other ones that came after Season 4.

Perhaps knowing this was the final season caused a creative spark in the writers and churned out something that wasn't cookie cutterish or having Deb continuosly drone on about whatever BS they want her to drone on about to extend time.",1390089600,,2695,4.597916666666666

The season deals with a new serial killer in Miami that, almost surgically removes pieces of the victims brains. Lastly we see Debra beginning to self-destruct as she is unable to deal with the fact that she murdered LaGuerta - who was also her mentor and friend.

I am sorry to say that Quinn's narrative, seems to be almost a filler if not a distraction here, since season 7 the Quinn character seems hold little or no worth as an associated character in Dexter.

5863944,2,B00DXP7L88,"I have not finished watching this season (2 episodes away), but I am very disappointed by the writing.

There are multiple instances throughout the season where major plot characters act in a manner inconsistent with all previous seasons.  Dexter, most importantly, becomes so careless (and utterly stupid) at times that I found myself complaining out loud and walking out of the room.

I felt as if the original writers quit and a new group came in;  a group who had never seen the previous seasons or read the books.  This new group must be fresh out of college, I kept thinking, because the show had become almost juvenile.  For instance, Hannah McKay returns in this season (as expected) and it is quickly noticed by the US marshall service.  Her face is seen plastered on the news in early episodes before her and Dexter actually meet.  After they meet, she and Dexter are on a road trip and she is sitting in the front seat.  So I am not an expert at hiding criminals, but Dexter is and it seems like common sense to me that he would at least hide her by having her sit in the back seat where the windows are tinted.  At other points, her and Dexter are sitting out in the open talking with various people.  Somehow, at no point does Dexter think to do minor alterations to her appearance (e.g., change her hair color).

This is just one example in a long list of instances where the writers managed to turn one of the smartest and well developed characters (Dexter) in TV into a complete buffoon.  Jennifer Carpenter's character, Debra, is the only consistent thing I have noticed in this season.

This season is also very slow compared to all others.  This is the only season that feels like a gimmick.  Meaning, it seems like the writers came up with Dr. Vogel and the ending, but had absolutely nothing in between.  So they rushed to put in filler and did not think it through at all.

The season itself isn't too bad, although it definitely isn't one of the best either.  The problem is that they focused A LOT on Deb and it kind of took away from the normal build up to catching ""the killer.""  It was a bit disappointing to see such a strong character go through such a ROUGH time after all the show has taken her through, but I guess they want you to feel like she reached her breaking point.

Again, the season itself isn't all that bad, just not one of the best that this otherwise GREAT show has put together.  The problem is the final episode.  I won't ruin it for anybody (although by now you have probably already heard about it) the final episode is probably the WORST I have EVER seen.  It answers questions for you, so it doesn't leave you in suspense like The Soprano's did, but it is like writers JUST released that was the LAST episode and hastily put something together!!!  Not the send off this show needed!!!!

I don't watch a lot of TV that isn't sports or news, so I was kind of sad to see it end.  If you are a fellow fan that just wanted to own the final season, this is worth buying.

No I would say this is the best season, in my opinion the worst of all (season 3 coming in second which kind of lost me). But I cant go out and say this flat out sucks either. Everybody else is right (in my opinion) about poor writing and character development this season. To be more specific, Zach which they killed off early than I wanted and he was of no importance following. They had a perfect scene of what could been amazing where Dr. Vogle, Dexter, Hannah, and Zach sitting around a table. All serial killers or associated with such and they could of elaborated on that giving a feel of a dark family with definitely dark intentions. But instead they kill Zach, Hannah stays inside predominately in hiding doing nothing (except for cooking of course), and Dexter mainly focused on Vogle and her family problems. And on to the ending, I understand and expected that a series about a serial killer will never end well. Somebody important was going to die and expected Dexter to. Keeping him alive just didn't really set well with my and especially where he ended up. Throughout the series his kills were always poetic, (as mentioned multiple times in the series) I thought it was fitting to drop Debra in the ocean, which pretty much ended his only tie in with his home. But faking his death and becoming a lumberjack ,in who knows where, seems very comedic in my opinion. What I was feelings at the end was, Really, is that really what happens to Dexter, Come on. So in wrap it was okay with me, could of been amazing instead they just wrapped the show up with no complexity or entertainment, just there to end all loose ends just like what most people in Hollywood will do these days.",1389398400,,1842,4.468842729970326

5863969,2,B00DXP7L88,"I honestly felt that Dexter should have ended in the seventh season, instead of trudging on for one more season.  It could have ended on a relatively high note instead of petering out.  The show simply lost its logic and reason.  The suspense of the preceding season was that Dexter could have been caught at anytime.  I'll say little about how the show ultimately ended - except that it royally SUCKED - but it became ridiculous that all of these people would have known Dexter was a serial killer and he NEVER got caught!  At one point - no less then five (!) people knew he was a killer - Deb, Hannah, Vogel, Saxon, and that kid.  Any one of them - save for Deb - could have turned in Dexter or done him in.  I was expected Vogel herself to do it at one point.  The storytelling became very linear, lazy, and predictable.  What I also failed to understand is why Hannah would have been so forgiving of Dexter (or why Deb could forgive Hannah).  I didn't think this was an awful season when it aired (its definitely the worst season - even though I disliked the Luman and Travis seasons, the storytelling was much stronger) but it has little rewatchability.  I'm watching it again right now as I decided to revisit the whole series and its by far the weakest of all the seasons.  I can barely muster interest in it.",1389312000,,1317,4.374485596707819

I am amazed to see the disappointment in this season from many fans of the series ... I don't get it. The fans and the disappointment, that is. I loved this season and was just as captured by it, as by the previous seasons - which means that I just HAVE TO see it to the end, when the first episode has begun. No turning back!

The themes exploring Dexters relation to the humanity within himself - I found them very interesting and engaging. And the new (and old) characters (re-)introduced to enlighten and give life to that conflict (having humanity or not) was spot on!

I am always at the tip of my seat with excitement watching `Dexter', but this is the first season that squeezed out a tear. Of course you keep guessing where it is all going - with many options open - and the near-end didn't hit me so hard, because of it being unexpected, but the whole; having earned happiness entails having earned vulnerability and hurt ... well, that got to me.

And so it is no surprise, that `the rebirth of Dexter' cannot be understood as a simple, one-sided subject. But I find it cathartic. A reminder of life's fragile beauty & sacrifices of divine, paradoxical depths ...",1388966400,2,1287,4.417721518987341
5863999,4,B00DXP7L88,"DEXTER hung on for 8 seasons and the end has come. There has always been something addictive yet totally unbelievable about this series, yet we all waited for the next season. Will Dexter finally slip up and be caught or will his killing spree continue?
Season 8 begins with a fractured Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) dealing with her killing of Lt. LaGuerta in cold blood to save Dexter. She has committed murder and knows that her brother is a serial killer--although he never kills the innocent,
It's this emotional trauma where Carpenter excels. She portrays Debra's emotional pain with intense zeal. The season is off to an interesting start.
Enter the lovely Charlotte Rampling as Dr. Evelyn Vogel. Rampling has always been a favorite of mine and she doesn't disappoint us in her portrayal of the mysterious Vogel. Rampling speaks volumes with her eyes and expressions. Vogel studies the minds of serial killers and she instructed Dexter's father on creating ""the code."" Dexter's murderous instincts will be directed to killing serial killers. Ok, the plot never made much sense considering Dexter works for the Miami Police Department.
In Season 8, Vogel begins to see that Dexter does have feelings and emotions and possibly can feel love, guilt and compassion. Dexter is a rare type of serial killer. Unfortunately, another serial killer enters the picture and Dexter makes some fateful decisions.
To complicate Dexter's life even more, Hannah McKay (Yvonne Strahovski) makes a reappearance. Nothing is as it seems.
As always Dexter is one step ahead of the Miami Police and steals evidence that would lead the department to a killer. Most everyone is oblivious to Dexter's deeds and that falls into the category of disbelief. The writers have been able to keep us interested though nothing is ever plausible in the series. There is no doubt that it is time to say goodbye to Dexter. Expect a shocker or two but it is hard to feel disappointed by the finale.",1388966400,2,1970,4.972727272727273

5864002,4,B00DXP7L88,"No spoilers here...

I was seriously considering not buying or watching this final season because of so many one star reviews here. That said, I've watched it and glad I did. I've watched all seasons starting with the episode one of season one, and though this may not have been my absolute favorite season, it was very enjoyable. There may have been a few moments or details I thought were odd but no more than any other season, and not near enough to ruin the season.

Also, I do not agree with what others say about it being a dull, slow, overly dark season. People here complain that the season was slow, I was almost more anxious than I have been during any other season. People have complained that the other characters were dull, but there were in fact interesting new developments and good chuckles made with the other characters. Maybe some people are just bitter that it has all actually ended or that it wasn't a super wow mind-blowing ending...

Order it, watch it. Judge for yourself. Don't build it up in your mind and expect it to be the most amazing thing ever and don't stress out thinking it is going to be a huge letdown. Do yourself a favor and watch this season open minded like you have all of the other seasons. :)",1388880000,3,1237,4.440528634361233
5864003,5,B00DXP7L88,"The plot was excellent, and included a surprise regarding Dr. Vogel, which I won't give away here.

The only problem I had was with the conclusion, to the effect that Dexter felt he had to disappear to protect his new family from himself. This was after he proved that he could walk away from killing an evildoer who fit ""The Code"" perfectly, although the unexpected cost of defeating his Dark Passenger was clearly not worth it under the circumstances. That is, his decision that he was a danger to those around him was not consistent with his new ability to walk away from a kill.

The line, ""I'm going to kill you with this pen"" was particularly good, similar to Richard Riddick's ""I'm going to kill you with this tea cup."" You know, of course, that the protagonist will make good on this. Dexter's original line might have been literally that he was going to kill a bad guy with the pen by writing an incriminating gunshot residue report, but effectively invited the bad guy to try to kill him on the spot, thus giving him the legal excuse he needed to do it literally.

This DVD did not have unskippable previews, for which I downgraded my ratings of Seasons 6 and 7 substantially, at least not on the DVD that I purchased, so I can award it the five stars the actual content earned.",1388880000,2,1288,4.472340425531915

She is undoubtedly a force of nature and makes everyone around her look better because she is old school from the times when acting was raised to that higher esthetic...Dexter could very well have become a sad case of binge series overkill and I still feel somewhat jilted by this new phenomenon that nullifies the senses.

The first seven seasons felt like unwrapping a present, but season 8 felt like finally seeing what's inside. Seeing what's inside is what season 8 is all about. There was closure. No loose ends. The story of Dexter Morgan impacted me in many ways. I'm glad I was able to get a peek into the life of Dexter. I was entertained.",1388880000,2,716,4.195652173913044

Im glad I finally bought it on dvd.  It was just as good as the other seasons except for the fact that you knew the end was coming.  Saying goodbye to a favorite tv show is never easy, and this was no exception.  Plot holes, continuity issues, and just plain dumb mistakes abound in this final season, but thats ok.  I must say it was like a roller coaster ride, and I was never bored.  Dexter was always a fun show to watch.

I hope they can continue the story someday, perhaps in a movie like they did with X Files, but Im not holding my breath.  In any case I will miss Dexter Morgan and friends and Ive enjoyed the time we had together.  It was a fun ride!",1388620800,,825,4.037037037037037

5864029,4,B00DXP7L88,"NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!

Lots of bad reviews and quite a few 5-star reviews as well here.  Overall I feel it was as good as I expected it to be - and that it was time to end the series anyway.  Most of my reviews for the other seasons were 5-stars, this is a fantastic series!

There are some fantastic, very memorable scenes in this season, and some that you will feel you they could have done without - but honestly it's like that every season.  Season 2 was probably my overall favorite, Dokes and his interactions with Dexter really made it great.  This season focuses more on winding everything down with the story lines, filling some holes in the history of Dexter and how things came to be with him, and of course building up to the ending.  The problem I think most folks have is that it had a slower feel to it because of all the holes they were trying to fill for those of us who really wanted to understand Dexter more.  Some of the folks that I talked to who were disappointed were hoping for huge fireworks of slaughter with Dexter laying person after person on his table every episode - it wasn't like that (and I don't consider that a spoiler, more of a warning to the folks who are hoping for it).  Character development did seem loose at times - but again, this is the final season - developing characters wasn't much on their minds, it was about closure.

This wasn't my favorite season, but it wasn't my least favorite either.  And I loved every season!  Go into this seasons looking for drama, story telling and closure and you'll be very happy.

5864040,4,B00DXP7L88,"Fascinated by those who didn't like the last season, which I found more compelling than any season since the almighty season four. All I can imagine is that these people were watching all these years expecting Dexter to meet a grisly end---never was going to happen and would have gone against everything the series was about. Yes there are some silly plotlines and credibility is strained to the limit this season but this has happened every season since its inception (This Miami police department has to be the dopiest group of people ever not to be ""on"" to the fact there is something very odd going on with Dexter). The death of Jennifer Carpenter was beautifully handled and inevitable and the little boy going off with a killer seemed appropriate to the character of Hanna who was really a survivalist. I remember the fuss when ""Talented Mr Ripley""first came out and that character got away with his crimes. There is a conservatism in a public who believe the killer should get their just rewards, this isn't a John Wayne movie and its not the 1950s,this is Dexter and Dexter was never going to die, in fact I'd be willing to take a bet it's not the last we see of him.",1388448000,,1176,4.578199052132701
5864041,2,B00DXP7L88,"I wish I could unsee this.  The Dexter series as a whole gets five stars, but the final season gets 2 stars.  Disappointing and manipulative.  I hate it when writers, studios and entertainment people decide to get sloppy just because it's the final season.  They end up making their final season against what made the entire series so popular to begin with.  The Dexter makers were trying to do something ridiculously poignant and they failed with this one.  I couldn't stop laughing at the constant absurdity that they were guiding the characters to follow.  Of course all of the characters are made to be totally out of character.  It didn't work.

5864047,2,B00DXP7L88,"Call me shallow and simple minded for them not ending the last season of Dexter with every episode being jammed packed with bloody violence, but I really feel like they could have ended the series much better. They bring back Hanna so Harrison has some type of mother figure for Dex to leave him to, Deb gets back with Joey so her departure is more heartfelt and memorable, and doctor Volgor convienietly has a son she forgot to mention who is more psychotic than Dexter at the last four episodes. To me everwas just too convienient and rapped up in a nice little package. But one thing I did like was that Dexter was not killed. But how do you end the series without him dying? He just gives up his psycho ways and becomes Paul Bunyan? I mean it is understandeble cause his dark passanger has taken away everything he loves. I don't know maybe it kinda makes sense they would end it this way. Tie up loose ends. But for some reason it just didn't rub me the right way.

5864058,3,B00DXP7L88,I had read the other poor reviews of this season but who could skip the last season of Dexter?  I agree with some of the criticism but not all.  I did not find all of the plot twists completely improbable or out of character as some folks did but they did feel rushed.  Many of the developments of the season could have worked very nicely in the story line if they had developed more slowly and thoughtfully.  Really if felt to me like the writers had a vision and needed more like a season and a half to two seasons to unfold it properly and they didn't have that so they just force compressed it into too little time.  Its hard to be more specific than that without giving major items away and I like to have reviews to read that don't spoil the season for me so I try to write the same.  All in all I'm not sorry I bought it but I do wish the writers had either altered the story to fit the timing they had or better yet vice versa - the show had run long enough to develop the story line more believably.,1388275200,,1008,4.040201005025126
5864059,5,B00DXP7L88,"I don't understand the desire to have some feel good Hollywood ending. These poor ratings based on what a watcher expected to happen is just silly.

I gave this season five stars because the story line clearly shows how our decisions can have grave consequences. For example, Dexter's decision to allow the police to handle Oliver.  Regardless of how Dexter became a cereal killer, he took others lives and sometimes outside 'the code'.

The scene at the hospital when Harrison was born was wonderful and heartbreaking at the same time. I was on the edge of my seat when Dexter disconnected Deb and carried her to the boat. What a great ending to a fantastic series.",1388275200,,666,4.724137931034483

5864080,1,B00DXP7L88,"I would never have given one star to this series, but the finale episode deserves it. I don't mind dark endings. Breaking Bad, for example, had the most heart breaking end imaginable, but it ended exactly as it should have ended. Nothing rang false about it. The finale of Dexter rang false from the start, and never improved. The writers seemed determined to punish the audience for liking Dexter and Deb. It was totally gratuitous to kill off Deb, after taking her to hell and back at the start of the season. She actually appeared to be on the cusp of making an independent life apart from Dexter, with a possibility of happiness. Getting shot by the Brain Surgeon was a surprise, but when her doctor said ""the bullet bounced around a lot, but didn't hit anything important"", I thought it was just a clumsy device to excuse letting the serial killer prolong the hunt. To suddenly put her in a brain-dead coma felt tacked on and phony. And for Dexter to lumber Hannah with his son and send her off to Argentina so he could go off and be a lonely lumberjack was the most ridiculous, uncharacteristic contrivance in the history of TV. Dexter faking his own death while being the subject of a manhunt would have made a lot more sense. Even allowing Dexter to be caught as the Bay Harbor Butcher, or allowing his character to be killed, would have been preferable to the mess the writers made of this series. After watching the show for 8 years, the ending should have had the power to move me. Instead, I found myself rolling my eyes and muttering ""give me a break"" repeatedly. I still love the series, but I find it pretty easy to pretend Episode 12 never happened.",1387929600,38,1665,4.516556291390729

All of her issues were so badly written and if they were going to make the show end with us sad about her dying, they should have made her a more likable person. She was such a rude and irritating person to watch.. not likable for women viewer especially. #2 We all wanted to see Dexter happy in the end. No one wanted to see a lonely, depressed guy. While being a killer is wrong, we were all rooting for him. #3 Dexter never would have really left his son forever. #4 No one cares about Deb.... oh, did I already say that? #5 Dexter should have lived happily ever after with Julia Stiles character, Lumen. That is who he really loved. He wouldn't have just forgot about her and go for what's her face. She was also not a very likeable character.

5864088,4,B00DXP7L88,"Based on some of the negative reviews, I almost never bought the final series of Dexter.
Luckily, my wife persuaded me and I'm very glad she did.
It's certainly not perfect. Season 8 contains plenty of the usual hard to swallow moments but I doubt if anyone would be buying this expecting total plausibility. This is entertainment not gritty reality.
There are also a few just plain stupid bits that did make me want to give the scriptwriters a good slapping. For instance, a certain character is on all kinds of 'most wanted' lists - anyone with a brain cell would at least think of cutting/dyeing their hair (or wearing a hat) but no... none of the characters involved ever think to suggest this.
On the other hand, I know some reviewers have said the humour is missing from this series. I didn't get that at all. It's rarely laugh out loud funny but this is (very) black humour and it definitely kept me amused.
The tension is also kept ramped up throughout the series.
Some also moaned about the product placement. Sure, everyone is using iPhones and Apple laptops. So what? I'm not going to switch to Apple just because Dexter uses their products. Just ignore it and get on with following the story.
Overall, this may not be to the same standards as Series One and Two but it's definitely worth watching. Don't be put off by the critics. You'll have to make up your own mind about the ending. I'm saying nothing...",1387756800,2,1419,4.568627450980392

Season eight is like a stand alone thorough movie. Some of the more recent seasons were getting monotonous and this season came back fresh and beyond intriguing. I am very pleased with how they ended the series and I believe since I am empathetic with the main character even still after 8 yrs, with him being a serial killer, this is testimony to smart writing. You get to know all about a whole new element to what makes up Dexter and just wow to the effort put into doing the show justice in its final season, when the producers could have skimped on everything and cashed in on the legacy.

I was expecting a climax of Dexter being found out and a story line based on that, instead they start introducing new characters don't really develop them because the writers  don't have time to. The characters you have grown to love like Batista rarely appear at all. The worst was  Deb's story. Her character is such a badass and they didn't give her character that respect.

Having said that, please let me qualify that the overall production - all seasons as a package - is a BIG 10 and worth giving your hours designated for TV entertainment to. Michael C. Hall is a master and will always have my approbation regarding his craft. C.S. Lee who plays Vince Masuka is a gem.

Could it be the way that Deb no longer looks at Dexter, but instead she is filled with frustration and confusion, betrayal from both her father and from Dexter?  Can it be she will sink as low as Dex, and think murder is alright?  I find that hard to believe!  They have set up seven seasons of her character as being honest and with integrity, and to now think she has turned?  That's not believable.  So for me, this season has been disappointing.

5864127,4,B00DXP7L88,"Given the fact that each episode beginning with the first season contained one improbable event after another, season 8 was a grand finale that ended as it should.  The introduction of Dr. Vogel as the creator of the code, was a much-needed explanation of how dexter became the vigilante psychopath.  Her character was mysterious, her motivations unclear, which left one wondering if she was not a psychopath herself.  Then it turns out her son is the Brain Surgeon.  That was the kind of plot line that kept us guessing until her death at the hands of her own son.  As I think back over all the seasons, I realize that Dexter is actually a love story, a grand one, not unlike Romeo and Juliet, except this one is not between romantic lovers, but between a brother and sister.  Alright, there not blood related and Deb did announce her romantic attraction to Dexter.  But that makes the story all the more poignant and endearing.  When I watched the final half hour, I realized the deep connection between this brother and sister, how devoted to each other they were. It is only fitting that Dexter's soul should be cast adrift and that he exiles himself to a self-induced purgatory on earth.  It took a while for me to understand just how touching, sad, and also brilliant this conclusion was to the series.  As another reviewer noted about the series, I will return to it in a few years and watch it all over again.

Whoever wrote that last episode should have all his fingers broken and forced to watched this last episode for every minute of the 6 to 8 weeks it will take to heal. I want him to SUFFER for the piss poor job he did ending such a World Acclaimed Series.  This has got to be the biggest BLOOPER Ending for any series in History.  I know I will be telling my grand children about this experience.  Seven years of my life wasted for a Crap Finale' to take the pleasure right out of being able to SAY - ""Dexter was the Best Series I have ever watched.""

On another note... True Blood has taken a serious turn for the worse too. When I saw Merlots re-named Balfore's that was the beginning of the END for me.

The writers in the final season seemed to abandon their mission of keeping Dexter cloaked in suspense and mystery.

SPOILERS FOLLOW

I can't say that the ending surprised me, but I thought it was interesting in that Dexter's need to kill has to do with his need for control.  But his greatest loss is a death that was completely arbitrary; there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it.  That's what life is like for most of us.  We get slapped with the fish of chaos, feel like our hearts are ripped out, realize we have no power to do anything in this ridiculous world but love the people we love and try to use our best judgment.  The most important things, those in which we are the most deeply invested, can be taken from us at any time.  That's why watching a show about a psychopath is such a nice break from reality.  We care, but he doesn't.  We suffer, but he doesn't.  We have no power when it counts the most, but he can do anything he wants to anyone and get away with it.  There are probably times when we've really felt kicked around by other people and wished we could handle things the way he does.  But we can't, because we *do* feel empathy, attachment, and fear; living vicariously through this show is about as good as it gets.  (This makes me wonder whether psychopaths love sappy kid's movies about animals or something, so they can live through us a little bit - that would be symmetrical, but a bit hard to imagine.)

This season is interesting because he finally lets go.  As the last body sinks below the waves and he surrenders to the onrushing hurricane, he realizes that his need for control destroys everyone he loves, and because he does love those who still survive he has to let them all go.  Great ending.  It's hard to know whether this sacrifice of his anchor to his nascent humanity - his love for certain other people - qualifies as redemption.  It seems humbler than that.  It's more that he realizes he's doomed.  No matter how high the body count gets, he will never have absolute power, and no matter how much he tries to change, he can never be something that he's not.  He can't resist playing the game other psychopaths bait him into; like calls unto like, and that's who he is - he's been that way in every episode, he has to play and win.  And he did always win as long as he felt no inner conflict; his mistakes were always the product of ambivalence.  But when he has people in his life whom he not just loves but needs, the  conflict between the desire to protect and the desire to destroy makes him a victim just like the rest of us.  He can't be a perfect predator anymore, and ironically his awakened heart's mercy makes things worse for everybody: he can't coldly commit himself to the most effective strategy, and hesitation gets people killed.

I felt like this caused me to explore some things about my own life, since I'm about his age.  When I was young, I could drop anyone or anything without a glance back.  My heart was like an etch-a-sketch, and every few years it would get shaken hard.  I could shed an old life like a skin and it would be a relief; I never thought about the past much.  Now I'm of an age where I realize I want roots, and I'm not sure how to make this new paradigm work for me.  I really feel what Dexter was going through.  How do you become real, instead of skulking through the world like an alien imposter?  How do you cultivate life, when your very nature is soaked from birth in disruptions, rejection and endings?

The show's creators' answer is that you can't, not even when people know your secrets and accept you for who you are and love you - at least not if you can't make a clear choice between your old MO and a swiftly-crafted and *effective* new one.  He was headed in the right direction, I felt, but for such a dangerous person growing pains are likely to be fatal.  I appreciate what this season did in terms of confronting this final paradox - that love and violence, or mercy and severity, seemingly cannot succeed when practiced simultaneously, and yet without power we are also screwed.  For Dexter, love is not enough, and now neither is control.  In a way, his attempt to become a person who understands feelings ruined him.

Giving up everything and becoming a new person in a new place is a reaction that's familiar to me - I wonder how it will work out for him.  Did he give up too soon?  Or does he need a few years to adapt to the man he's becoming before he can have his family again?  I hope there's a sequel someday; I feel like this story still has a lot of arc left.",1386892800,,4619,4.328288707799767

5864149,3,B00DXP7L88,"To my mind, the finale episode rescued a season that had dragged its way with too much talking, too much moralizing, and a strong sense that much of the goings on were contrived on the fly.  Dexter as a program was always on the edge of being overly moralizing but generally had the right amount to fuel its anti-hero.  In Season 8 it went over the edge and that made the season tedious.  The finale episode staggered to its end of a completely burned out Dexter via a surreal and not quite fitting last quarter.  That this followed a really surprising and yet fitting turn of events with Deb made an uncomfortable contrast.  Compare this to the end of the other anti-hero drama series, Breaking Bad, which ended with both a bang and a whimper.  That was truly brilliant television.

Still, the creators of the series deserve congratulations for giving us an enjoyable and provocative venture that pushed the boundaries of the genre.",1386806400,,933,4.6871165644171775

Just have to say from the moment I started to watch season one it had me hooked, this show has everything you could ever want, it is very cool and different from the ""norm"".
The actors are all really good and the story lines have so many twists and turns that it keeps you on the edge of you set at all times.
My favorite seasons are one, two, four and seven, with out a doubt!
Now for the bad part, I read a lot of the season 8 reviews, that were not favorable but I had to check it out for myself, I do have to admit they were right.
I was very disappointed in it, I think if it wasn't the end of the show it would have been ok, but the ending ( the last episode) I think if they would have left out the last minute it might have gotten three stars from me.
It was like the writers got lazy and just through things in not even caring anymore, and thats really sad to me, and the characters who I love so much seemed very ""flat"", Dexter even, his mystery and aloofness always kept me hooked but in this season he seemed to be much different.

I see that many people did not like season 8 as a whole, but I did find the premise very interesting and thought it was very interesting that Dexter actually started to change. THEN, the last episode ruined EVERYTHING for me.

This season started to give us hope that Dexter might actually have a ""normal"" life and may have lost his compulsion to kill. He may not even be a psychopath - he seems to have a conscience and be capable of real love. Then, the last episode happens. Deb dies from a gunshot wound, and what does Dexter do? He steals her out of the hospital and dumps her in the ocean. How horrible. Dumped just like the pieces of trash serial killers he previously dumped. So, apparently he couldn't wait a week and have the plug pulled legally with a decent burial and funeral so all of her coworkers and loved ones can say goodbye.

And then he fakes his own death because he has determined that he ruins every life he touched. EXCEPT, he has now lost the compulsion to kill, he is moving to South America, so how was he expecting to further ruin lives? Now, he HAS ruined the lives of Hannah, the love of his life, and his son, because he has now abandoned them forever. Gee, thanks Dexter.

After watching the last episode, I just felt hopeless, frustrated, angry, and depressed. Thanks writers. Because of this horrible end to this series, I will never ever recommend this series to anyone who hasn't seen it.

I mean, they couldn't give us some hope and something uplifting as an end?

I'm disappointed, this whole season focused on people who inevitably died, Zack and Evelyn. Deb's death was so fast and unexpected, and I felt the whole season Dexter might as well be smoking crack in the bathroom between scenes because his logic and reasoning made NO SENSE at all. For one, why would he think it's a good idea to go to Argentina with Hannah? I thought the Dexter I knew had more sense. And why wouldn't he leave Deb's body to be buried by her friends so they have closure instead of putting her in the ocean with all of those criminals he's killed.

I was very disappointed with the final season. Weak writing. The brain surgeon was a bore. The reveal that Harry had someone else come with the code and she was the mother of the brain surgeon was down right silly. Deb's death was anti-climatic and a diss to her character. Her burial at sea was a joke. Dexter abandons his son with a serial poisoner to raise was laughable. It's like the writers were throwing mud at the wall to see what stuck (a young Dexter protege, Masuka's daughter, and on and on). All were useless, undeveloped plot lines that went nowhere.

Dexter as a lumberjack after boating into a hurricane was the final insult.

I am not sure where to begin with out spoiling it for anyone, though I doubt you could dodge the story line if you read the online new sites at all.

The story is just garbage and contradicts everything the first season set up.  Dexter has gone 180 degrees from where he started a cool careful rational person to what we have now a irrational, reckless some would argue not intelligent person.  The story he is involved in is one that just never really fits the series, I am surprised anyone thought this was a good idea.

The actors outside of Micheal C Hall do not get a shot to work with any of the material especially the biggest bombshell in the series.  With a talented group they really short changed everyone on the cast.  This is what happens when actors get more of the pie of a series, really they should have brought in the writer of the books and let him finish out the TV Series.  While watching the extras as this happened (Having Showtime) the writers are delusional about what they were doing.

Over all you will find that C. Hall does a great job with the material, everyone else gets short changed.  The story will frustrate you especially if you think that around season 3 the writing went down hill.  They p.lay out the first part of the season way to long and do not give any of the core actors that have been in the series since day one, much time to bring closure to their characters.",1386288000,,1471,4.3321167883211675

I hated the way both Harry and Vogel kept giving him these intense stares as though they were examining him for a science project. I also didn't exactly believe that Dexter should have gotten off, nor that Deb should, either, just because of their bad childhoods and their traumas. Granted, Deb ends up poorly. The show was pretty good up until last season, when it started going south and Dexter became so desperate about his kills that he'd have made mistake after mistake and would have definitely gotten caught. And not to be cruel, but there must have been a child actor available that was better than the kid that played Harrison!

I won't reveal any spoilers, but the plot was bad and the series finale was bad.  I really wish they would have wrapped up Dexter after 5 seasons.  I wish season 5 had been devoted to the downfall of Dexter (getting caught by Quinn AND LaGuerta...Why did LaGuerta never talk to Quinn about his suspicions from season 5?).

The writers apparently saw Dexter as a folk hero vigilante playing out their daytime fantasies.  As much as I loved Dexter the thing I wanted most was for him to have to face his biggest fear: go to jail (plus having his son and everyone know who he really was).",1386115200,,773,4.268965517241379

There was already enough drama and tension through the season and no need to throw some last minute twists that make no sense whatsoever.

Not to mention the side stories that add no value to the main storyline (e.g. Quinn's Sgt exam - what happen to the chick who got the job by the way?; Jamie's romance with Quinn).

I didn't mind all the emotional turmoil (in place of action) in some of the intermediate episodes because I get that the writers had quite a lot of work to do in order to take Dexter from 'Dexter' to 'Pathetic Wuss.' But in the end, they seem to run out of time and have their characters do unmotivated, unrealistic, or otherwise unbelievable things. As an example, I just don't see Deb being quite as incompetent as portrayed: we caught this really bad serial killer, I know, let's leave him all by himself for a while and see what happens! Right. And Dexter's actions at the end are just stupid. I don't buy the final ""boat trip"" because Dexter didn't even believe in funerals and there's no way he would take those chances to accomplish something relatively meaningless (to him). The writerd can say ""oh, but we made him change"" in this series but after a while, one just has to wonder ""why."" If you take Dexter and turn him into ""non-Dexter,"" who the heck cares what happens to him. I watched the series to see the adventures of Dexter, not Wusster.",1386028800,,1238,4.458149779735683

I was amazed how they wrote this and were able to have me think about it and agree that Harrison was better of with Hanna (even though it was sad to know he would be separated from Dexter). It was a happy ending in the sense of knowing Harrison would not be at risk because of having a serial killer daddy and the enemies that we know come with that. The bummer of the ending for me was the fact that Dexter did not die. I'm torn on that. It seems he should have followed through on that to protect Harrison. The other side of the coin though is that it is sort of true to the character that, as has been mentioned by others in the series, Dexter is about survival and all about his own survival at the end of the day.

They had their stumbles and problems along the way, (some hate season 6, some hate season 3) but I followed along with the show, trusting that the writers knew what they were doing, and for seven years I wasn't disappointed.

Season 8 changed everything, and they have no excuse.  The writers knew this season was going to be the last 2 years in advance.  So before they started production on Season 7, they knew they had two seasons to tie everything up, and after a pretty good build up in season 7, I was expecting season 8 to knock it out of the park, but it failed on every level.

Each season through 7 had a loose theme, such as ""parenthood,"" ""faith,"" ""friendship,"" etc, and Season 8 tries to do something with the theme of ""family,"" I suppose, but this theme has already been exhausted after seven seasons, so there wasn't really much left to explore.  Side characters get subplots that last for episodes that end of going literally nowhere (CS Lee and his agent should be pissed as hell) other plots and guest stars that appear for a few episodes and disappear and reappear as if at random, and for no discernible reasonthe major mystery/villain is an afterthought and boring, and the ending is...abysmal.  The most brain-dead monkeys clacking on typewriters for thirty minutes would have been able to come up with something more plausible and more true to the characters than what these jokers wrote.

Honestly, I feel terrible for Michael C. Hall, and really all the actors, who worked hard for eight years to be rewarded with this crap.  They deserved better.
Much had been made about the last episode, but let me be clear.  Every episode is wretched.  Even the early ones that are bearable are soon ruined by the plotting that comes next.  I honestly got to the point where I just didn't want to watch anymore because I just knew the next episode was going to be worse.

 Please don't waste your money.  The end of season 7 is a much better finale than this dreck.  It may have even ruined the brilliant early seasons for me.",1385856000,9,2124,4.564643799472296

Because it is THAT bad and will only p*ss you off that you wasted it.

My wife and I were very big fans of the show and were excited to see the final season available, so we binged on it over the course of 2 days. The dialogue was forced and stunted, the acting was bad, plot depth was all but non-existent, there were a couple dead end sub-plots added that were nothing more than time fillers, etc. I am all but certain they essentially off-the-cuffed this whole season and could not have cared less about rendering a memorable ending to an otherwise superbly creative and out-of-the-ordinary series.

No exaggeration: the worst last season and final episode to a television series I've ever seen. That the words 'brilliant' and 'satisfying' have been applied to the final season and conclusion of this series boggles the mind.

All this said, I do understand that there's no accounting for taste. So, if you thought the ending to 'Breaking Bad' was really good, the ending to 'Lost' made you wish you'd never started watching the show, the ending to 'The Sopranos' was so-so, and no show will ever end as well as did 'Seinfeld' or 'Cheers,' you'll likely want to heed my warning about purchasing this last season of Dexter, and wait for it to be available for free (Netflix, etc).

UPDATE: 1/4/14: For anyone that has Netflix, I noticed last night that the final season is now available.",1385856000,19,1619,4.572413793103448

5864207,5,B00DXP7L88,"The question that hangs over the entire series is whether Dexter might have been different if his adoptive father had tried to stem his murderous urges instead of re-directing them.  Instead of don't get caught, suppose Harry had tried to teach Dexter not to kill in the first place?  Was he destined always to be a psychopath?  It seems we are watching in the final installment a Dexter who has evolved.  It's not all about him and getting away with it.

This final rendition is less about the thrill of the chase and more about risks and consequences than any other season has been.  That's fitting since this is the end game, and Dexter must ante up his final payment.  How much is he willing to do, and what is the prize he seeks?  His own skin vs. love. Each episode resonates with family themes as Dexter finds his ""spiritual"" mother and begins to see at the same time what his existence meant to this father. His battle with his sister who is offering him a most unsisterly love can only grow more fierce when the one woman with whom Dexter is obsessed reenters the picture.  Family--can't live without them, can you kill them?  Even his angelic son manages to take actions that put Dexter severely at risk -- what is a father to do? Dexter is wonderful with Harrison and his patience an object lesson for every parent who has screamed at his or her child in the supermarket.

I felt the ending was fulfilling while also being open enough that more story-telling could be appended.  At some point, I hope they come back with even another series or perhaps a movie or two.

5864209,1,B00DXP7L88,"I couldn't believe the producers of Dexter let the season be written and end in this fashion.  If you loved Dexter just leave him in the church with Deb telling him to put the knife down because this season just takes you on a nowhere trip to a complete downer of a finale that leaves you shaking your fists in anger.
Major spoilers from here.
Being that this is the final season why not let the villain be the most dangerous and vile of them all instead of this whimpering little brain surgeon-he didn't even rate and was pretty much dead on arrival.  A look back at the past baddies and this last guy was lacking in creativity- the bottom of the barrel not even worthy of the title serial killer maybe serial wimp.
Charlotte Rampling was superb as Dr Evelyn Vogel inventor of Harry's code and provided a ho-hum storyline reuniting Deb and Dexter after the Laguerta killing.  She would have been cooler as the split personality, secret villain hopped on experimental acid that transforms her into a Ms. Hyde with superhuman strength that picks up younger men or women at night clubs for some afterhours romping but no she ends up getting killed by her own son, the wimpy brain surgeon.
The Laguerta storyline from season 7 is where it all started going askew and provided this story arc about Deb quitting, blaming Dexter, trying to kill Dexter, forgiving Dexter, rejoining the force, starting to get back with Quinn and then left a stroked out vegetable while recovering from a gunshot wound.  Reads like a soap opera and not deserving of Showtime.  Deb deserved better than mercy killing then dumped in the ocean by Dexter with the rest of the vermin and why go through the trials and tribulations just to die poorly in the end.  Do you see and sense the frustration from the fans now?
A more fitting ending - Deb is recovering in the hospital, the villain takes her hostage in front of Dexter and escapes by boat resulting in a spectacular, high speed boat chase with the hurricane roaring in the background.  Both boats get caught up in a huge whirlpool out in the ocean, Dexter makes a spectacular leap from his boat to Deb's, a close call, evenly matched fight with Dexter killing the villain the boat motor explodes unable to take the strain of keeping the boat from being pulled down into the deep, both Deb and Dexter jumped into Dexter's boat as it circles around them in the vortex.  Racing back to Miami Deb dies from her wounds and fast forward to Deb's funeral with full police honors.  A few months later, Dexters meet Hannah and Harrison in Argentina. Fade.
Instead we get a hasty killing of the brain surgeon in police custody by Dexter.  No police department is that lame to let the brother of the victim in the building let alone the same room.
Hannah, oh what a tease, this character provided so much promise as a vehicle for Dexter's character growth from killer to semi-normal but why all the courtship just to fake us out and end up a single mom to Harrison.  We kind of knew it was never going to end happily but Dexter exiled in Alaska in an even more absurd episode of Axe Men.  Ridiculous.
The sales from a successful show season finale should be through the roof but instead the reviews are mixed and the fans upset by the ending.  If anything the final season seemed like it was hastily written from end to beginning without any thought to being creatively better than the past seasons just sub par and rather lumbering in pace.  Fans should be sad about the ending of a favorite show instead we're all mad about how it was ended.  We will miss you Dexter.",1385683200,3,3586,4.529411764705882

Many people seem to dislike if because it's more serious tone and it's thematic deconstruction of Dexter's character. Unlike the vigilante-feeling of especially the first 2 seasons the end of the show focuses on the fallout, the consequences of what Dexter is. The final episode exacerbates this and was criticised heavily for it. While I agree that the finale was not perfect, I believe that not giving the show a happy end was quite fitting and that the viewers should indeed have to experience along with Dexter that his actions would have consequences.
Ending a show like Dexter is an almost impossible job, I feel the writers have pulled it off quite well and I can't understand all the negativity about this final season and it's finale at all. Calling the final season unbalanced and some of the twists illogical is preposterous considering what has happened in the previous seasons already, that this show is not too realistic should be clear to any fan by now.

There were a few good elements of suspense here and there, Dr Vogel being one, and of course not knowing exactly how things would end.....but every exciting ending scenario I played out in my own mind was better than the actual ending when it came.

5864225,5,B00DXP7L88,"To wrap up the story in twelve episodes or chapters, thats short, thats fast, but thats radical,  la Dexter. He manages to solve a ton of problems in these twelve episodes.

First he finds a surrogate mother for Harrison, and that was difficult to find. Luckily the only woman he had loved and that was still alive, apart from his sister turns up and re-activates some fundamental mechanisms. And Harrison likes her. She is very special but she wants to become a good girl.

He manages to solve the problem of his father and how his father, a good cop, could accept his adoptive son to become a criminal, how he managed to come up with the code, etc. In fact the symbolical mother surrogate of his, of Dexter, comes up to him and reveals who she is and what she did. She reveals that his father ODed on his heart drug when he could not stand what Dexter had become any more. Dexter hates that doctor Vogel that has nothing of a bird in that story, at most a vulture but that is no  bird you try to attract in your garden with a bird feed and a bird bath.

He has to solve a last case of a serial killer who is aiming at both him and Doctor Vogel. Her past is revealed and she becomes extremely dark and deep with one son killed by another, you know the story of Cain and Abel. And the killing son is sent East of Eden in some institution in England, or something far to the East. And there he is tortured into medical blankness since he is a criminal who deserves to be punished even if it is with drugs or some archaic violent treatment like electric shocks or other forceful manipulations of the body or the brain, and why not the mind and the imagination.

Of course the dear son who was buried alive in this institution plans a good case of arson, with seven dead people in the wing that burns, and himself among these seven, officially, because in fact he manages to get out, change identities and then move on, looking for mummy, Doctor Vogel, and all those she preferred to him, and first of all Dexter. And the blood trail can start under the police identity of the brain surgeon because he saws up the skull of his victim in a very special way and scoops out one very precise section of the brain and delivers these extracted sections to his mummy. A yummy appetizer for Christmas dinner or Thanksgiving celebrations.

He of course has to save his sister from private investigation and then to make her a star in the Police Department. So he finally comes over his need to kill with his last victim and gives him over to Deborah for her to arrest him. But a Federal Marshall comes up and he completely messes the case, frees the criminal who kills him straight away, takes his gun, shoots Deborah who shoots him but in vain. And things will not turn honky dory and there will be some complications. Dexter then has to close up the file and clean up the plate. Deborah disappears in a hurricane.

Finally he has to take care of himself and to protect Harrison and the substitute mother who has taken the boy to South America, and there is only one way. So he disappears with his boat into the hurricane. A tempestuous ending but it works.

And yet they more or less kept one card up their sleeves, I mean the producers, for a sequel in lets say five or ten years, when Harrison reaches teenage and starts moving towards finding his father and recuperating the father model he needs and remembers from his tumultuous first four years. Check amm by yourselves with the DVDs how they manage to keep one bun in the oven in slow gestation.

You can always dream. But it is sure the author of the book series will be able to go on working with Dexter if he wants, though the last volume was announced a long time ago and will maybe finally come out next March (2014) and it is supposed to be entitled Dexters Final Cut, which promises quite some blood.

Well see. Que sera sera. Will I be pretty? Will I be rich? What will be, will be!

5864226,5,B00DXP7L88,"I just finished watching the final season of Dexter and I guess my review is very different from a lot of other people but I found it to be BRILLIANT! There were still bad people to kill. Debra came back whole. The story with Dr. Vogel was very interesting. I loved that Joey and Deb were kind of back together again and I did not mind at all seeing Hannah again. I think she really loves Dexter and he loves her. The fact that he almost becomes human because of love is a good thing. The only thing I did NOT LIKE is the end of the season for obvious reason but I will not SPOIL it for the people out there who did not see it yet. I think the writers did a great job with the final season EXCEPT for the end. The end could have been so much better but even though it did not end well, I think it is still realistic that they chose it to end this way. Great JOB, Great series!! Dexter, you will be missed.",1385251200,4,905,3.9508196721311477
5864227,5,B00DXP7L88,"While I would agree with some of the reviewers who said the writing was lacking in this final season, I have to say I thought the series ended as well as it could, given the circumstances set up in the previous season.

MAJOR SPOILER ALERT - if you haven't watched the final season, you may not want to read any further.  Fair warning...

I should say that I watched the final season as a whole - when the DVDs were released. Hadn't seen any of the aired episodes, so from my perspective, the final season was more like a long movie watched over a period of a week instead of months. With that said, I did have some (relatively minor) issues in the first 3 episodes of this season, with Deb having one meltdown after another.  Granted, she had good reason - but I felt some of that time could have been better spent developing other characters and expanding the plot.  I also felt the addition of Misuka's daughter was extraneous, and came at a time when the viewer would have been better served by a more intensive storyline of Dexter actually QUESTIONING the code.

The psychiatrist, played by Charlotte Rampling, was an interesting twist.  The viewer was never really sure what her agenda might be - and I, for one, appreciated that approach, as compared to the shows that draw a fine line between dark and light, good guys & bad guys. Dr. Evelyn Vogel was an enigma - one never knew if she was Florence Nightengale or Dr. Lechtor - her ambiguous portrayal of the character kept me in suspense, and added an even darker element to Dexter's past - he finally met his maker, and didn't know whether to embrace her or kill her... undoubtedly a problem most humans face when coming face to face with their creator.

Personally, I never cared for the character of Hannah, although I can see why she was reintroduced into the final season.  Harrison needed someone, and though I might have preferred some other solution, Hannah was probably a more suitable ""match"" for Dexter than any of his other romantic interests (including Rita).

In the big picture, I felt the real ""flaw"" with the final season was that it seemed rushed and could have benefited from another 2 or 3 episodes that would have gone further toward tying up the loose ends.  I'm not really sure why Deb had to die, and that whole plot line seemed a bit contrived.  She just happens to get shot, develop a blood clot, and end up a rutabaga, which results in Dex having to essentially kill her.  In some ways, though, that pull-the-plug scene showed that Dex really HAD changed - from the emotionless psychopath to a genuinely loving brother/father, capable of self-sacrifice, capable of empathy.

Some reviewers have said they felt he should have literally gone down with his boat, and Deb, in the storm.  And yet... I think the emotional impact of that final scene where he is clearly alone, goes to illustrate that he is aware of exactly what he is, precisely what he has done, and now he is ""paying the price.""  He upheld the code (in the sense that he never got caught - rule #1), but the ultimate irony may be that he ""caught"" himself - in seeing himself for who and what he was, he knew he could no longer afford to be around anyone he cared about, and so he chose the ultimate self-punishment - what amounts to a living hell of enforced solitude, isolated from any possibility of redemption... or was the isolation itself his attempt at redemption?

I have to say the series did not end the way I WANTED it to end.  No happy endings for anybody.  But I felt it ended the only way it COULD have ended, all things considered.  I tend to re-watch my favorite series once every couple of years - and I wonder how I will see it with a bit more distance and hindsight.  It would be interesting if some of the 1 & 2-star reviewers might post a follow-up sometime down the road.  I felt there was a lot more to be read between the lines... if viewers are willing to look.

If I were going to review only this final season, I'd give it 4 stars, but I'm giving it 5 stars to reflect my love and appreciation for the series a whole, and for those who made it all possible.  Thank you for an incredible 8 years!",1385251200,41,4170,4.435124508519004

I felt compelled to write this review because in my opinion season 8 is very well done. This show has been about character development from season 1, if you buy season 8 expecting the same character interactions as season 1 you will be disappointed. The whole point of the show was watching dexter develop from a sociopath to a human being with real emotions. Season 8 accomplishes this, the other characters have had 8 years of developing too. Hannah Mckay comes back and is a definite asset to the show. I saw reviews blasting the shows writing and storyline, in my opinion its not worse, its a different season with a different storyline, attempting to button up eight years of story and character developement. If you are a dexter fan i would reccommend watching this season, and if you are new to the show watch it from season 1 forward, this is one of the few shows i would go back and watch all over. Don't let the negative reviews stop you from watching the conclusion to one of the best shows on television.",1385251200,3,1172,4.481308411214953
5864229,4,B00DXP7L88,"I bought Season 8 and was ready to be disappointed....not true.  Before I bought the series, I had it in my head that Dexter must have been caught....why would everyone hate the final season so much?  I mean, isn't he the serial killer we all love and understand?  His thoughts are the exact thoughts we think but don't say and his not understanding muchof the ""big deal"" of simple human nature makes him endearing.

I didn't want him to get caught.....  I even thought someone slipped and told me that he was caught.  You can imagine my surprise when he didn't get caught.  I was excited at first, but the more I watched of the finale....the more uneasy I felt.  This is what the writers wanted us to feel.  There is an uneasiness in rooting for the bad/good guy isn't there?  I think so many people didn't like the ending is because ....and I'm not sure if they want to admit it....they related to Dexter.  He was intelligent, felt out of place in most social situations, wanted to fit it but didn't know how....we all have a dark something in our personalities.  It may not be serial killer dark....but we all have it.  The ending made us relate too much to what could happen to us if we let that dark something in our personality go too far.  I don't mean serial killing, but in the sense of not relating, hurting others and feeding into the darkness of our own  personality (jealousy, greed, envy).

I really enjoyed the final season....until the final scene!  They went one scene too many...It made me feel like they took this wonderful character and just made him creepy rather than the intelligent, struggling being that he was through all the seasons.  I liked the Dr. Vogle character- the psychology of it all.  I liked that Dexter's trauma was being healed and it was questionable whether Dexter was truly a psychopath or if he had PTSD exacerbated by the good Dr. and his father.  I even liked Hannah who mirrored Dexter's own trauma history

Buy this if you haven't....you'll like it....if you can examine inside yourself what it really is that you don't like about the ending.  I think people related to Dexter so closely that the ending reflected something inside of themselves that made them feel a little too uneasy.

5864237,4,B00DXP7L88,"Fair warning, this will contain some spoilers from the 8th season and previous seasons, so proceed at your own risk...

I am conflicted about the season because on one hand I think it did very well in explaining the rest of Dexter's back story and introducing Vogel as almost a surrogate mother to him. On the other hand, the end was a very big letdown. I actually really liked the first part of the season, just did not like the direction they took the last handful of episodes. I think the series always had to end with him either dying or everyone finding out exactly who he was and him trying to get away. And while he did not exactly get away without any consequences, the show does end with everyone from his past life thinking he was who they always thought he was.

The show always straddled the line between portraying him as a good guy, vigilante and a killer who needed to be put down. It was most compelling when he was just on the brink of being caught for what he did, or when his ""other work"" came too close to his personal life and put others in danger. Throughout the series really only three people ever found out that he was a killer (who were not already killers themselves). I think the show really almost had to end with everyone becoming aware of that fact, and I personally think the season would have been more compelling if the last few shows were about him having to deal with the repercussions of everybody realizing he was in fact the Bay Harbor Butcher as opposed to taking out one final bad guy.

With that said, accepting what they did do with the season and the direction it was taken, I think it was done well overall. From the story with Vogel, taking on an apprentice of sorts, the return of Hanna and fixing his relationship with Deb, were all good stories, and the acting as usual was very good. The one thing I do like about how the series ended is that he did not get to live happily ever after and that his self imposed exile was a pretty miserable looking existence.

As for the set itself for those who get the discs. Like the other seasons the episodes are spread across three discs. There is commentary on some episodes and 5 or 6 relatively short behind the scenes features. The first two episodes of the new series Ray Donovan are also included.

5864246,2,B00DXP7L88,"This season was definitely disappointing, note there will be SPOILERS!

What makes this season a dud, is for a series finale it lacks the conviction to focus and conclude the characters story in a meaningful way, it was wrought with silly story tangents that didn't really add much depth and only wasted time to conclude the story or add character depth to the primary characters.

The driving underlying conflict was never about the serial killers, that was a typical formula that all crime series always conclude, the bad guy gets caught or dies. But the primary conflict that this series had never addressed, only with Deb and Sgt. Doax was Dexter's hidden life and the tension of it being revealed. Instead Season 8 revolves too much on the brain surgeon killer story which probably happens to be the most uninteresting killer ever. He isn't even revealed until near the end of the season, which creates a bland killer that really never had any interesting character development to him, the way the Ice truck or Trinity Killer did in previous seasons.

Then the addition of Zack, Dexter's possible pupil was cut short, when he was killed, I actually thought that could have been a plausible story line to grow on, again just wastes time to develop and conclude the older characters. Dr. Vougel is an interesting character, she adds depths to Dexter's origin as the author of the code which he always thought was from Harry. But midway in the story her irrational maternal instincts to save her lost son who happens to be the brain surgeon, ends up costing her life, again another story plot that just wastes time which should have been all focused on Dexter's instead.

The return of Hannah i actually liked, but again wasn't developed enough, she is a believable complement to Dexter, she really isn't a disturbed serial killer, just a pragmatic woman, that believes killing as a natural instinct to preserve herself or her loved ones. Her story line being chased by authorities was a good plot that should have been more intertwined earlier in the season.

And yes, Deb..she is definitely one of my favorite characters, and i have no problem with her death :( But its just the way it happened didn't seem so meaningful or worthy of a finale. I understand and accept these characters are cops and they live in a dangerous world, where death is a close reality, but to have her die in a coma/stroke from the shot that Dexter could have prevented if he killed the surgeon on the spot, almost makes you mad at Dexter instead! Deb should have died heroically like saving Harrison by jumping in front of a bullet, yes its cliche, but would have been fitting and believable in her line of work.

Personally i'll sum up the way season 8 ""should have been"" ideally presented, was to be more like season 2 where Dexter's identity is discovered right from the beginning of the season and the authorities go on a wild goose chase. Dexter becomes an outlaw on the run, then Deb and Dr. Vougel become his eyes/help to escape, while they take care of Harrison. Then rather than having the brain surgeon as the main enemy, the FBI, authorities and a super smart/tough but corrupt bounty hunter kinda like a super Lundy/Doax chase after Dexter. Midway he runs into Hanna and Zack, they help, he teaches the code to help shape Zack as a new avenger. Then as the story concludes  and the chase gets closer to Dexter, somewhere in the gunfire Deb blocks a bullet from hitting Harrison saving him, but she dies heroically. Dexter is caught but Hanna and Harrison escape to Argentina. While Dexter is being transported by authorities the hurricane escalates causing their van to careen off a cliff and into the ocean where Dexters' body isn't found. One year passes and show a killer escape on a technicality, but is caught by Zack who becomes the new Dexter. And as the final scene, showing Hanna and Harrison in some little beach cottage in Argentina, the door opens and a shadowy silhouette casts on Harrisons' smiling face..""assuming its Dexter""  :)",1384992000,74,4037,4.732574679943101

I just think most people today only want to see movies/TV shows with lots of action and thrills, with as little dialogue as possible. Which is a shame. It's as if people only have the mental energy to 'see' and not 'think'. Yes, this season was a chatty one, and in my honest opinion, I felt it was refreshing and eye opening. I mean, we have 7 seasons of lots of entertaining kills and suspense, so what is wrong with 1 season of Dexter battling with his emotions (cont.) but actually TALKING about it? I loved how they dove into the psychology behind Dexter and Debra and their relationship. I was hooked until the very end, and in the back of my mind, I couldn't believe how poorly people responded to this season. Can I understand why people hated the series finale? Yeah, I can.

*Spoiler Alert*

I was actually okay with the execution of Dexter's and Debra's goodbye. I bawled my eyes out. I can't recall the last time I cried so hard. Honestly, as much as I hated that Debra died, I found it fitting, because of LaGuerta's death. Now, I know deep inside Debra was a good person, and she didn't deserve to die. But... neither did LaGuerta. So, it was unfortunate but... it balanced it out, in my honest opinion. PLUS, it is one of the tragic, but expected, consequences of being a serial killer and having those you love close to you. I could also dive into Dexter's and Debra's actions, and lack thereof, and their consequences but that would take forever. For example, had Debra never mentioned anything about Hannah... or had Dexter just went ahead and killed The Brain Surgeon... Blah, blah, blah. You get the picture. That's life. You do something or don't do something, ANYTHING can happen.

I was okay with Dexter driving his boat into the hurricane. I was expecting him to die, and I was honestly hoping for that to happen. He had went through so much emotional, mental and physical turmoil. Plus, a lot of good people died, all being tied somehow to Dexter. So, it made sense for him to die, or least to stay far away, so that nothing bad would follow him, because eventually Hannah and Harrison would receive the same fatal fate as Debra's. (More on that in a bit.)

My issues with the series finale is that they didn't really close anything up with the rest of the beloved characters. They were just sort of left hanging in the air with no real conclusion or resolution. It was like, ""Ok, well, that sucks for them."" and then onward to this and that. I feel the characters deserve more respect than that. A more concrete finality. I mean, yeah, Debra just died and they're thinking Dexter is dead, too. ...but that's it. Moving on, apparently. I wanted to know: What will be in their future? In that time period, what do they let go of? What do they hold onto? What are they gonna do? Or at least try to do? Even the slightest indication would have been better than nothing.

Also, we learn that Dexter survived the hurricane. Ok, fine. Sure. Whatever. So he ends up being a lumberjack in Oregon. I'm on the fence about it, actually. It feels really random, in my honest opinion. They couldn't have thought of Dexter doing anything else? But... I do understand Dexter wanting to be in isolation and staying as far away as possible from those he cared about. It was a sad, tragic ending for him. Well, everyone basically. Honestly, though, I think he should have just died in the hurricane. He should have died and be with Debra in the ocean. But that's just me.

I know, it's a crappy review but... it's wicked late and I'm wicked tired and I'm just writing what stuck out the most for me. I do think it was a great season, not the best, and that the series finale definitely needed more work. I just think people are really upset because, well, it's the final episode. There is no turning back. They can't do another season and fix their mistakes. It's done. But... looking at the entire series as a whole, looking at it big picture wise, it is a spectacular show and I gladly own every single season with pride. I LOVE this show. So sad to see it go... :(",1384905600,4,4192,4.416558861578267

It was sheer agony to go through each of the final 6 episodes.  What I'd highly recommend is you simply watch the final episode and save your self the pain.  Except for the death of Rita earlier in the series, the script writing stayed pretty close to the actual books.  Obviously this is why the show was so entertaining.

No spoilers but I will say this final season was an awesome roller-coaster ride of ride of emotionally wrenching ups and downs.  You got to see sides of people that you never thought possible.  The ending was in some ways satisfying and in other ways disappointing in ways that seem to leave open the possibility of a reunion show or movie.

The final season shows Dexter undergoing a sort of cathartic healing which is just a tad unrealistic for most but not all serial killers.  Serial killers don't usually go into spontaneous remission but the writers had to end the series somehow and they did a good job here.  I do think its possible to constantly manage deep ugly antisocial inner urges with enough mental discipline, I'm living proof of that.

While the way Dexter ended might not please everyone, I think the final season ended all the story arcs on a satisfying note.  I think the ending was unique enough to elevate it above the canned expected endings.  The writers take you on a romp through several endings till you get to the one true final surprise ending.

The reviews on this Final Season however,  tended to be so negative as I first read them on Amazon, that I actually questioned purchasing this Final Season.  From the negatives which were written, it seemed that this Final Season must be a horrible letdown.  LUCKILY, I ignored those reviews as impossible to believe--, and I was right.

The Final Season is EXCELLENT.  Without revealing any of the plot, I wish to state that the plot is ""SOLID""!  I do not wish to go into the details but would encourage anyone who has enjoyed Dexter, to watch and you should thoroughly enjoy this final season.  Remember the series has to end.  This ending was very good.

Debra's situation as it develops, Dexter's problems & loves, the Dr. and and their relationship in his developing life, as well as all the other twists in this season are well done. These and other plot scenarios all work their way in a very acceptable manner throughout the 12 episodes.  We are dealing with a very complex character with extremely complicated relationships that are well handled.  I see no loose ends that need tying up, as this ""VERY WELL DONE"" Final Season ends.

This Final Season was fast moving in such a way that it constantly kept my interest and attention.  It was sad and sweet and horrible and satisfying and suspenseful and probably not perfect - - , but VERY GOOD !

The final NW Camp scene is probably not needed, but certainly not a bad inclusion.  The future still is open to all kinds of possibilities, even a Dexter Movie.",1384646400,3,1676,4.608108108108108

5864272,1,B00DXP7L88,"***This review contains spoilers which I suggest you read instead of actually purchasing this season. You're welcome.***

Although I have ordered this for my parents who do not have Showtime, I would not order this for myself. I believe that any loyal Dexter fan would (and should) pass on this season so as not to spoil your opinion of the whole series. I wish I had.

Where we came from: I believe that Season 7 ended the way that the series should have ended. It left enough to the imagination to be intriguing, yet tied up enough loose ends to provide closure. Season 7 also had the same consistent, quality writing and pace that we had expected from Dexter since the start. All the seasons previous, especially the season with John Lithgow, were exceptional.

Where it went: Instead, the endless stream of producers listed in the opening credits got greedy and created Season 8. Character development was not as good as before. A new character was introduced: Masuka's daughter. The writers must have run out of innuendos to write for him and instead gave him a daughter to explain his sudden turnaround brought on by lack of creative writing while providing the excuse of Character Development. It was just filler. They could have written him out of the season or killed him off and it wouldn't have lost anything.

There was also more talk than action once we meet the doctor who persuaded Harry to let Dexter ""do his thing"" as well as Dexter's heir-apparent. The pursuit of the doc's son (The Brain Surgeon) was similar to the classic Dexter but with too many people ""in on the secret"" the show's magic was gone. The further the season went, the more of a stretch it became, until the last episodes where it just got ridiculous and - quite frankly - predictable.

The magic also failed the show when Hannah returned. We all knew it was coming, we just didn't know when. At first, there was the same hostility between Deb and Hannah but she (Deb) seemed to end up liking Hannah. Hannah made Dexter go all soft on us which was a complete change from the reasons I watched the show. Tension and suspense are key to this type of show, not lovestruck sympathizers. I realize the need for character development and improvement and morality but that takes a back seat to action, which is why everyone watches the show!

The decision to kill off Deb at the end of the show, shot by the Brain Surgeon and, after her death, taken from the hospital by Dexter to be dumped in the ocean as the hurricane approached, was not a great way to go. Quite implausible that no one would have noticed this. Neither was Hannah and Harrison, pursued by inept bounty hunters, ending up in Argentina endlessly waiting for Dexter who would never get there. More ridiculous choices made by the producers and writers to tie up story lines that didn't need it. There is the possibility that these should be emotional scenes but they do not come across this way.

I could go on and on listing interactions and plot devices that added nothing to the show. Leaving all these out would have left us without a Season 8, which is my whole point.

Overall I think the producers and writers tried too hard to fill the episodes that Showtime purchaed. They tried to incorporate everything into this series finale. They tried to cash in on the amazing success of the previous seasons. They tried to go over the top in the finale and instead upset their loyal fans.

If you want to know how an incredible series should end CORRECTLY, watch Breaking Bad instead.",1383436800,36,3528,4.614035087719298

5864274,5,B00DXP7L88,"The final season of Dexter may have disappointed a lot of people, but sometimes that is a sign of excellence. People often crave for their favorite series to end in a ""satisfying"" manner, but with a show like Dexter there really was no way to end it in a satisfying manner without devolving into the predictable. The common idea was either Dexter was going to get caught, be killed, or some combinationof the two. Both of those storylines would have been predictable and trite even if to some extent emotionally satisfying for those who followed the series from start to finish.

I liked the ending to Dexter, not because it was really ""possible,"" because the whole series portrayed a scenario that was not really very likely. The reason I think it was a perfect ending is because it was unsatisfying, and leaves much to the viewers imagination. We don't know what would have happened if Miami Metro, as a whole, found out about Dexter and his role in Laguerta's murder. You are left to wonder about those things. If everything had been tied up nicely as the critics wanted, then the series would just die. But as it stands, one can wonder what Dexter might be like in 10 years, or whether Miami Metro might still discover Dexter's secret. If your imagination allows it, you can continue to write the series of Dexter and allow it to captivate your imagination for as long as you desire. To me, that is the sign of excellent writing and stories; not that everything gets wrapped up in a satisfying manner. Sometimes life has storylines that don't seem to make much sense, and are never really resolved. Why shouldn't television be the same?

None of the questions I posed need to be solved. Dexter was an excellent television show from start to finish. We don't need to know what happens to everyone. Use your imagination rather than criticize.",1383350400,13,1844,4.688271604938271

5864280,2,B00DXP7L88,"While I initially refused to watch the final season of Dexter, I finally gave in and watched it for one reason: I really missed all of the characters.  I wanted to see Deb and Angel and Joey and Masuka, and especially Dexter.  Michael C Hall is one intense man, and I loved his interpretation of Dex.  Jennifer Carpenter is an extraordinary actress, in my opinion, and made Deb better than she was written.

However, as I watched Dexter slowly ooze from a hard-core badass into a 14 year old girl (apologies, girls) with a huge crush, I could only stare in horror and repeat the same phrase, ""What is he doing??? WHY IS HE TALKING SO MUCH?"" I'm surprised we didn't see him doodling hearts and writing bad love poetry as he struggled to muster up the energy to find, much less kill, the bad guy.  ""I don't waaaaannnnaaaa!"" he whines, so instead he calls Deb to take care of it for him.  Ugh.

I was actually glad to see Hannah... mistakenly thinking that NOW we were getting somewhere!  Imagine holding a brightly colored, shiny balloon.  Let it go and watch as the escaping air propels it to its demise, and there we have the Hannah story line.  She's such a devious vixen!  So... not even a wig, or a dopey hat to disguise her when she's a hunted fugitive? Not even one little plot twist to make her interesting?  Nope.  Instead, she's wasted on cooking scenes and ingenue-ish love scenes. Bleah.

Oliver Saxon, played brilliantly by Darri Ingolfsson, was a wasted opportunity. This character had the potential to be THE most insidious villain of the series, the biggest challenge to Dexter ever, the most prolific killer and plot enhancer of the past 8 years.  Instead, he went from highly intelligent psychopath to bumbling oaf.  His ending was an insult to oafs everywhere.  Hello, flat balloon.  *sigh*

The last 2 minutes (or so) of the very last ""Dexter"" made me wonder: Did the writers think that they were doing their viewers a favor by showing that?  Because, just for the record, I could have lived without it.  Seriously.

I could go on.  In fact, I kind of *want* to go on but I won't.  There are too many things to say, so I will stop here and go rewatch a couple of episodes from the first season, just to try and rinse the disappointment away.",1382832000,21,2259,4.5209876543209875

5864285,2,B00DXP7L88,"In all honesty most of Season 8 isn't as bad as many fans say (except for the final episode, which we'll come back to.) However even taking the most optimistic of viewpoints it's a very poor fit for a final season. Simply put the feel of the final season should have been along the lines of Season 2, that feeling of the world closing in on Dexter and that he was going to get caught. Unfortunately since that material had already been mined fans were instead left with a somewhat generic serial killer hunt and family dysfunction storyline that just felt like a retread of earlier seasons.

(MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW)

There's some interesting things going on with the introduction of Dr. Vogel as a surrogate mother figure. This also gives some very interesting ideas as to whether or not Dexter is unique or if his code can in fact be tought. Dexter has let various people in on his homocidal side but has never truly taken on an apprentice or tried to instill Harry's Code on another. It's an interesting notion, though sadly it's also cut short before it really gets good.

What's going on with Deb throughout the season feels largely obligatory. Obviously she couldn't just be ok with how things ended the previous season, but except for one or two key moments there's nothing very unexpected about her downward spiral. Largely the season as a whole feels obligatory and not climactic.

(SPOILERS END)

It would have been just an OK finish if not for the final episode. The choices made and the way they are presented are simply mind boggling. Very little of what happens is satisfying and it's presented in a way completely devoid of the tension that Dexter has always been about as a show. It feels like it was made by completely different people who'd never seen an episode of Dexter before. If it weren't for this final episode most would shrug this off, but the actual finale is wrong on so many levels it taints not only this season but the show as a whole.",1382400000,7,1966,4.589743589743589

If a Dexter movie is in the works, PLEASE Writers, make all this a horrible, bad, disgusting, weird, disturbing dream!!!  Or should I say nightmare!  The only way this season can ever be redeemed is if it NEVER EXISTED at all.  Spoiler Alert...Maybe Dexter wakes up from being hit on the head by Saxon or a concussion caused by the hurricane and POOF... Deb is alive, Dexter killed Saxon on his table (which after all, is in his nature to do) and all his ""unnatural"" decisions that created this mess in the first place NEVER came to fruition.

This whole Dexter becoming human theme caused him to do incredibly stupid, irresponsible, life altering acts that changed everyone's destiny FOR THE WORSE!!!  Too many unanswered questions, abandoning Harrison, letting a serial killer who you have known for 2 seconds raise your son, killing Deb (directly and indirectly), Quinn not knowing what happened to Deb.... the list goes on and on but one thing is for sure.  This all pales in comparison to ""Dexter the Mountainman"" and the one constant in his life - Deb being gone forever.  Even my son who considers Dexter the greatest TV show of all time couldn't believe the shockingly stupid, dull, rushed, low budgeted, uninspired ending!!!

No ONE wanted to see Dexter dead.  That would be too final, a slap in the face to all faithful viewers and leaving no possible future for Dexter.  That would have sucked big time.  But Dexter's death would have been better than this pitiful, lazy, disappointing ending!!!  Dexter's ""human"" actions caused Vogel's and Deb's death.  Not to mention the twisted unnatural fate of so many others.

The season as a whole was just NOT up to typical Dexter standards.  But you could almost be okay with it because even a bad episode (writing) of Dexter was still so good it put its competition in the dust.  If Season 8's ending was of Season 1-4 caliber, it would have partially redeemed the entire season.  But now.... Dexter has a new title.  ""Worst Finale of All Time"".  I do NOT think the writers could have possibly come up with a worse ending.  What an enormous let down to one of the most admired series of all time.

The final season is a meandering bore. The writing is horrible. The plot lines are offensively stupid.  Plots are contrived, illogical, and completely defy common sense. It's as though they're deliberately trying to insult your intelligence.

It was interesting how in this season they conveniently skipped over the rather messy details of LaGuerta's death, jumping forward instead. None of the other detectives twigged, not even Quinn, who had his suspicions about Dexter in the past?

Secondly, Vogel, one of the most unbelievable of all characters. Not only does she have an exceptional understanding of the criminal mind, she also has a depraved and murderous son who miraculously faked his own death, only to return to Miami craving his mother's love and acceptance at precisely the same time Vogel decides to reach out to Dexter... That's a pretty big coincidence!

Then, Dexter mentoring Zack. Why would he risk it, after so many previous threats to his freedom? Again, yet another stretch of credibility that treats the audience as stupid. But the silliest feat came when US Marshall Clayton was killed by Saxon. Didn't he recognise Oliver Saxon, since by that time Saxon's face was already splashed all over the news, as a wanted suspect....

Probably the only interesting aspect of the story for me was Hannah returning. That dynamic could have carried much of the season I feel. And Sean Patrick Flannery was great as Elway. But ultimately I think that by season 6 Dexter had stopped being involved storytelling and faded into pure entertainment. Season 7 made up for it in some respects, showing Dexter's vulnerability by him being under suspicion and investigated again, albeit by the less-than-likeable LaGuerta.

I would have given this last season of Dexter one star, but out of respect for the series as a whole, I gave it two.  I loved this series!  I watched faithfully and never missed an episode.  And when I heard this was the last season, I was so hoping that the writers would come up with a spectacular ending (not necessarily happy, but something suitably jaw dropping).  What a disappointment!!  This season (to put it in a word) STUNK!  The pace was unbelievably slow and monotonous;  you thought, surely, surely, the writers were just building up to a grand finale - but then the finale came and it was not grand, or jaw dropping.

The writing was weak, the interaction between the characters was weak.  It was like the writers just gave up and went on auto-pilot.  The bad guy of the season, the Brain Surgeon, should have been Dexter's greatest challenge - ending with an antagonist that he either couldn't beat, or gave his life trying to beat (which would have been a great ending).  But the Brain Surgeon wasn't scary, wasn't a great challenge, and really did nothing for the character development of Dexter.  While the writers were trying to tie up all the loose ends, they brought back Hannah (a decision by the writers I thought questionable), but then did nothing interesting with her character.  They killed off Deborah - in a most unspectacular, ho-hum way.  And the final straw was the ending...Dexter as lumberjack, WTH?!

I could go on and on about how bad this season was.  Short story is, the writers took a brilliant series and butchered, just butchered, the ending.  It was so bad, I'm not even going to purchase this season on Blu-ray (I have purchased every other season)...I'm just going to pretend that this season never happened.",1381363200,117,1772,4.6980519480519485

5864298,5,B00DXP7L88,"Each season of Dexter followed a formula: Dexter has a foil who teaches him an important lesson, and a victim (who may or may not survive) who drives that lesson home. In season: (1) Brian shows the necessity of having a code, at Deb's expense; (2) Lila shows the evil of thrill killing, at Doakes' expense; (3) Prado shows that you can't teach the code, at Ellen's expense; (4) Mitchell shows that you can't pretend to be normal forever, at Rita's expense; (5) Chase shows that you can't have partners, at Lumen's  expense; (6) Marshall shows that religion offers no moral alternative, at Harrison's expense; (7) Isaak teaches him that home is where you can be yourself, at Hannah's expense. The beauty of season 8 is its misdirection. It appears that Dr. Vogel is there to show that you can't reform a psychopath, although we know by now that Dexter really isn't one. But Vogel isn't the real foil, who stays hidden for much of the season, and teaches a similar but more compelling lesson: you can't change your ways, at Deb's expense, which brings us full circle and explains the ending. All the lessons above are variations on a theme, which is driven home only in season 8, and made even more poignant by  maybe the show's best episode, Argentina, in season 7, which sets up much of season 8. All in all, I think this season was a satisfying ending to the series, and more subtle, I think, than many of the reviews here would indicate.",1381190400,10,1440,4.577519379844961

For me, Season 8 started falling appart in episode 94: The conclusion of the show was really disappointing.

5864303,1,B00DXP7L88,"Dexter Season 8. Well, where to begin? Already people are starting to voice their dissent at the horribly weak ending to such a fantastic (at least at the beginning) show. Here's my addition to add to the growing multitudes...

Dexter was one of those increasingly rare shows when it first began. Compulsive viewing almost by definition, the first four seasons were are combination of mesmerizing characters, well constructed plot threads and macabre humor.

Unfortunately, from there it has been a steady decline culminating in this crushingly disappointing season 8 finale. Deborah's storyline was tedious, Batista virtually disappeared into a pale imitation of his former personality and even Masuka, the comic relief to the show, was replaced by a listless, drab, non entity of a character. Superfluous characters came and went, ceasing potentially interesting story arcs in their tracks. The college guy serial killer for example. I can't even remember his name but they spent two or three episodes building up a potential story changing plot line just to have him killed off randomly.  They could have made him Dexter's protg, someone to hand the vigilante torch to when Dexter leaves? But no. He dies. Off camera. For no reason at all. Thus making his storyline strangely irrelevant to everything else. I imagine the conversation between writers went something like this:

Writer 1: ""Hmm, where should we go with this plot line?""
Writer 2: ""Dunno. Just kill him off and let's grab some donuts.""

And don't get me started on the star of the show. Dexter, previously a darkly humorous enigma, has progressively been turned into a boring, predictable paper mache substitute of his former self. Gone is the sarcastic, ironic personality of a genius psychopath with a moral code. In his place is a confused, rudderless mess of a main character which has lost virtually everything that made him a likable anti hero.

Also, the whole Dr Vogul, Brain Surgeon thing was completely under developed. There are so many different ways they could have taken that to make it more interesting, but instead it just fizzled out with Dexter finally dispatching the bad guy as almost an after-thought. The whole thing just felt flimsy and two dimensional. At no point did I ever feel Dexter had met his match with the Brain Surgeon unlike several of his other nemeses from other seasons. I was like the 'writers' (although I would be truly embarrassed if I had written this season) were just doing the bare minimum to cobble a season together.
To conclude my rant, here's my thoughts on the final episode. I need to say there are PLOT SPOILERS FROM HERE.

For Pete's sake, what were the writers thinking when they thought of this ending?! I mean, not to be overly dramatic about it (although it's a shame the writers couldn't have been a bit MORE dramatic when conceiving this episode!), this final installment was the most slap dash, lazy, disappointing, poorly written, just plain STUPID ending to an eight season show like Dexter I can think of. There are so many things that are annoying  it'd take me forever to list them but fundamentally, the most glaring is WHY WOULD DEXTER ABANDON HIS SON AND FAKE HIS OWN DEATH? WHY?? Particularly as the whole season there was this (incredibly boring) under tone of Dexter reforming himself from serial killer to family man? Is it because his sister died and he felt guilty? Really? Is that really what Deborah, who loves her family vehemently, would have wanted him to do? Also, what was dumping Deb's body at sea all about? That's where he dumps the bodies of evil people so, it begs the question, why would he dump his sisters body there?

If there's any justice in the world, the final episode would be re-written and the writers of the original ending banned from ever working in television again",1380585600,23,3833,4.8936825885978426
5864304,3,B00DXP7L88,"***Spoilers Ahead***

As a fan of Dexter throughout, there were high hopes of a great ending to this show after the series resurrected in Season 7. Although this season had some great moments, it became impossible to ignore aspects of the show that were too unbelievable or didn't make sense:

1. Deb walked in to Miami Metro drunk to confess that she killed LaGuerta and all but nothing happens. Really? Would that happen in real life where a drunken cop walks in to a police station and makes a major public confession all to have it virtually ignored?

2. From the end of Season 7 into early this season, Deb changed her mind about Dexter's life 3 times. Deb drives their car off into a swamp all but to realize she needed to save Dexter's life...again (referring to the fact that she could have killed him instead of LaGuerta at the end of Season 7). And all that is addressed is a 5 minute counselling session with Vogel afterwards. That's it? Deb is impulsive, but not that impulsive. Also, wouldn't this incident be talked about the next day at Miami Metro as being a little odd?

3. At the end, Dexter looks straight into the camera, resembling a horror movie preparing for a sequel. He also drives his boat into a hurricane leaving it in pieces and he somehow survives.  A stretch on reality.  It would have made more sense if Dexter had sacrificed himself based on the self-knowledge that he would have eventually harmed Hannah and Harrison.  This would have been consistent with Vogel's view that he might have been capable of at least some empathy when observing him with Hannah.  The Dexter story has been told and it was time to close the book in the final season - the last scene left a door open.

4. At one point in the series, 3 serial killers (Zach, Hannah and Dexter) were having dinner together with Vogel, who herself was enabling the murders to continue.  This scene in of itself is hard to imagine realistically happening.

5. To create great suspense, the good guys and the bad guys both have to be smart. Throughout Season 2, it was never known if Dexter would be caught and how, and we had a great performance by Keith Carradine as Agent Lundy asking hard questions.  In this season, with the exception of tracking down Hannah, the cops weren't asking enough questions.

This season had a great start introducing us to Vogel as an expert on psychopathy, a great idea because the whole series has been based on a character study of Dexter.  Although it did over some insight into psychopathy through Vogel, it could have offered more: was Dexter actually a psychopath capable of some empathy or feelings towards others?  What is the criteria for being a psychopath?  Is there any treatment for psychopathy?  And what effect does psychopathy have on their offspring?

Getting into the grey areas of plausibility was part of the downfall of seasons 5 and 6. It's disappointing this season wasn't able to combine factors from previous seasons that worked so well to make a believable, suspenseful and insightful finish to what has been a great series.",1380326400,4,3074,4.671614100185529

unfiled court document about cell phone locations of debra and dexter discssed in episode 1 of final season never brought up again afterwords.
time wasting musakha's daughter plotlines
Hannah kills billionare who was hiding her from authorities only they never discuss his death or anyone looking to find out what happens to him after hannah and dexter take care of his body
quinns sargaent exam plotline that has another actor who gets the job instead of him, only we never EVER see that actor again for the rest of the season.  waste of time!
Hannah never disguises herself in public even though she's wanted Women
Dexter too trusting of hannah after attemping to kill deb last season, and then he request deb to hold hannah in her house, she agrees willingly after all of season 7 and after she poisons the 2 of them this season.
one point deb told quinn go back to jamie in one episode right before deb tried to kill dexter and her in a car crash, then out of the blue in a few episodes down deb wants to pick up her relationship with quinn, WHAT!
cheap way of dexter not killing saxon and handing him over to debra, deliberatly leaving his blades within arms reach of saxon which he then kills the u.s. marshall with and shoots debra.  Dexter even told debra in a few episodes before this happened that oliver saxon is extremely dangerous, the whole setting up debra to get killed off was so badly written.  this is by far the weakest writing in the entire season that angers me other than debra's character being killed off screen(technically her brain died to failed medical procedure but still shes basically got killed OFF SCREEN!)
Dexter becomes a lumberjack, REALYY!!!! he's the new trinity making a hobby/living chopping wood.
dexter whole character the last six episodes is just beyond weird and poorly written.  you don't make your character dark for 7 seasons then all the sudden he becomes nicer(even jeff linsey the creator of dexter was upset over this on a reddit AMA, sociopaths can't change).
the treadmill scene with harrison is just so bad, it was so obvious with that scene that there was something severely off.

The reason is that she was murderous herself. Although she was a despicable person in Season 7, she later changed and became a better girlfriend and mother to Dexter and Harrison in the final season. Season 8 is boring at first. But, it becomes more interesting, intense, and even tragic in the series finale.

I did not like what happened at the end of this show. But, I understand why it happened the way it did.

5864307,3,B00DXP7L88,"CONTAINS SPOILERS SO PLEASE WATCH OUT

We wrote our first Dexter review at the end of S7 and threw up some possible story points for S8 (pretty unsuccessfully!).  There seems to be alot of early negative reviews here, relating to the season in general, but particularly with the ending and although we were disappointed too the 1 & 2 star ratings are way to harsh.

After writing the S7 review we had hoped that the final season would eschew the standard Dexter formula and NOT introduce new characters and provide yet another serial/master killer.  The reason being that all S8 had to do was start at precisely where S7 ended and should have simply focused on Angel, sharply changing his mind about retiring, and with the full resources of Miami Metro behind him, aggressively investigate the murder of Maria (I mean, is there a fan out there who really did not want to see more of the immediate aftermath of Maria's murder..........particularly when Dexter & Deb went back to the party....and then the hours, days and weeks after!?).  Ultimately, the entire season would have revolved around the unit slowly piecing together evidence that points to Dexter being the killer (hell, you even had Angel find the warrants Maria had obtained for Dexters/Debs phone records!!).  The story turns/developments that could have been done would have been more than enough to fully flesh out the season without the unecessary tangents that this final season took.  In addition, it could have included and given more screen time to the main supporting characters (eg. Vince would have been pivotal in forensically identifying his 'hero' as the 'villain' & Quinn would have been divided by his affection for Deb).  There was alot to work with here!

With the murder of Maria the final season was always going to be downbeat but even though we thought it would happen the death of Deb was still heartbreaking (particularly when the impression was that she might be allowed to survive.......but it appears the makers did want her, and Dexter, to pay the ultimate price for their actions).

With a show that lasted 8 seasons, with fans investing so much time and caring for such appealing characters, the show should not have ended with so much ambiguity and so many loose ends and unanswered questions (to the point that the last few scenes seemed like an 11th hour tack on).  Not that we want to be spoon-fed but a certain amount of definitive closure should have been allowed for.

Despite its failings S8 is still very good but contrary to the filmakers apparent endgame this is a show that demanded, and we hope most fans would agree and have accepted (and really wanted), a 'happy' ending.......with Dexter, Deb & Harrison making an escape when it was clear Miami Metro was on to them (how great would it have been to see the reactions of Angel, et al, once the evidence slowly revealed the truth about their great friend Dexter!?).

Thanks once more to everyone involved with this marvellous programme that we will almost certainly never see its like again......but we will also kind of hate you because, at the moment, the first thing we think of when we now think of Dexter is that Deb dies.....hopefully that will fade in time.

PS: a few more days have passed since we saw the final episode and the ending has gotten less and less acceptable.....to the point that our rating has reduced to 3.5 stars.  Apparently, we need better lives if we're still thinking about a TV show, huh!?",1380240000,6,3476,4.789297658862877
5864308,1,B00DXP7L88,"Poor Dexter. The first four seasons of this show are amazing. After Rita died, the show went down hill with a quickness. It went on at least three seasons too long with the final season being the worst. It started off strong with Deb being on drugs and no longer working with Dexter but went left field after the first three episodes. The storyline sucked and was predictable (killer on the loose, Dexter has to catch him) and there were new character's I didn't give a damn about (Dr. Vogel?). I hated how they had fillers for 90% of the episodes and the characters that have been on this show for years weren't given anything of substance to work with ( What was the point of adding Masuka's daughter?).

Than some stuff was too unbelievable. For example, Hannah (Dexter's lover), went on the run after being arrested for murder at the end of the 7th season. Fast forward to this season, Hannah is back in Miami (with no disguise) and is now married to a billionaire who she later ends up killing. Like really? Do the writers think us viewers are stupid? A billionaire is going to marry a fugitive??? Then after she killed him, we (the viewers) never heard any more about him. A billionaire is not going missing and there is no massive hunt to find him. Also, the scene where Harrison, (the 4 year old son) falls off the treadmill and it CLEARLY is a grown man acting as his stunt double is just cringe worthy. It's like the director didn't even try.

Last, I hated the ending. Deb dies, Hannah runs off with Harrison, Dexter fakes his death and becomes a lumberjack, and his co-workers NEVER find out he was a serial killer. Eight seasons. Eight long seasons. All that time wasted for Dexter to just fake his death and become a lumberjack. Terrible. The writers should have went the ''Breaking Bad'' route and gave the viewers what they want and that was for Dexter to get found out. The hunter becomes the hunted.

If you haven't seen all 8 seasons of Dexter, don't bother. Just stop at 4. You won't miss anything trust me",1380240000,15,2026,4.485094850948509
5864309,2,B00DXP7L88,"I haven't seen the not-yet-released DVD of course, but just had to warn people away from watching this season. The series had gone downhill from its peak first few seasons (interesting main character and main story lines, with lame side characters and side stories) to being no longer engaging, and it really hit bottom this season. I saw a cheap-o book recently that listed the worst TV shows ever made, and I thought it was hilarious that the guy included Gilligan's Island which he slammed for plot inconsistencies. I've heard people complain about plot holes in this season of Dexter, but that's about as meaningful as wondering where Ginger got all those dresses. The whole final season was ridiculous and bad (unlike GI, which was ridiculous and fun). My wife refused to waste further time and quite half-way through the season; I kept watching because I like to watch train wrecks and so I watched this one to the end. It was a bad, bad end indeed. Trying to watch this while also watching the brilliant last season of Breaking Bad was truly painful.",1380067200,6,1057,4.75

5864312,3,B00DXP7L88,"If you haven't seen the finale you should stop here. In my opinion all Dexter-seasons rank between very good and fantastic, including season 8. A good plot, turns and suspence through all episodes. But why do the showrunners have to come up with such a depressing ending ? I know, because it's finished, so they don't need to care about future viewer figures. Such an ending is far from  customerfriendly. Don't they care about their viewers ? The answer is simply NO. We see it in many TV-shows that producers and writers don't care (sometimes they make a cliffhanger even when they know that the show will be cancelled). And then this pseudo-psychological babbling from the producers (there is an interview in the net), that Dexter had to take the blame and the ultimate punishing. Death was too good for him, bla bla....
For me the weak link in this season was Debra. She messed everything up from the start. She even caused her own death, because she set the womanhunt"" on Hannah in motion. Sorry to say, if anyone, then Deb got what she deserved. So why have the showrunners had to punish Dexter, Hannah and Harrison and by doing that punishing the greater part of their viewers (there are polls online) with an ending they don't like (which they knew). I like Dexter very much and have all the DVDs, but I make a stand and won't spend money on season 8. If people would do that more often, maybe the TV showrunners would think more customerfriendly in the future. But as long as they can do as they like and people will buy it anyway, why should they care as long as the money flows. I will take that all back for Dexter if they decide to produce a final final season or maybe a movie to wrap things up more anti-depressing (customer-friendly). 5 Stars for the Season, -10 Stars for the ending.

I was hoping an praying that with season 8 they would make something fantastic and send Dexter out with a bang.....boy were my hopes shot down, bang bang bang. I don't know how they managed to ruin one of the best shows on tv but they did and they sure put the nail in the ""Dexter"" coffin with the finale. I thought the ""Weeds"" series finale was bad but Dexter's finale takes the cake by far. It irritates the hell out of me, it makes me angry......if I could take it all back I would stop at season 4 and pretend the next 4 season never happened. I won't reveal any spoilers for those that haven't watched but the ones who have watched know.

5864314,5,B00DXP7L88,"Just finished watching the final episode and boy was it a tearjerker!  Sad to hear so many negative reviews.  I enjoyed the series from beginning to end.  And not to give anything away, but I think the ending as sad as it was, left it open ended.  Sometimes those are the best endings.  I really like the journey Dexter makes throughout the series and him realizing that he isn't such a monster after all and has a capacity to love.  Season 8 really shows this.  This season was also one of Jennifer Carpenter and Michael C. Hall's best performances.  Their chemistry together is hard to find.  Deb's personal journey was also gutwrenching at times.  Really looking forward to rewatching this season when it's comes out on DVD.  Adding it to my collection of the series.

It really does have a ending that makes you think afterwords and to why things happened the way they did.  Much like Lost's series finale. I hope you enjoy Dexter's final season :-)",1379894400,6,953,4.601190476190476

5864316,2,B00DXP7L88,"""Dexter"" went from being one of the greatest shows on television to one of the worst. And it pains me to say this, but the series finale was quite possibly the worst in TV history. Seriously. The ""Seinfeld"" finale is golden compared to this one.

I feel that ""Dexter"" went steadily downhill after Season 4, which admittedly was so freaking fantastic that it would be next to impossible for anything else to measure up. However, Season 8 was by far the worst of all. The Dr. Vogel plot was weak and a terrible way to wrap up what was once a great series. Let's just get to the finale, which is the absolute worst thing about this season. (Warning: massive spoilers ahead.)

1. I had this feeling that Deb's character would meet an unfortunate end, but it really seemed unnecessary here. Does everyone in the show have to be miserable at the end?

2. Hannah is now raising Harrison in Argentina. Really? Would it have been so awful to have Dexter flee Miami and at least leave Harrison with Deb? (And, you know, keep Deb alive?) And how is Hannah raising Harrison a good idea? Need I remind everyone that she is a serial killer also? Maybe of a different breed than Dexter, but still. What about his grandparents, Rita's parents? Dexter never thought that Harrison might be better off in the care of his family and siblings? And isn't anyone going to wonder what happened to Harrison after Dexter is declared dead? No one will think he was out on that boat. Dexter never would have taken Harrison out in a hurricane. Hmm.

3. I don't think Deb ever fully resolved her ""I am in love with my brother"" issues. They were revealed at the end of Season 6, and then it's like the writers went, ""Yeah, that was weird. Let's just not talk about it and pretend it never happened.""

4. The whole Dexter dumping Deb's body in the water was odd to say the least. I kept waiting for Harry's apparition to return and say something like, ""I know you don't need me anymore, Dexter, but I'm back to tell you that even I don't know what the heck you're trying to do right now!""

5. I was so sure that the finale would wrap up with Matthews letting Dexter off the hook somehow, and with Dexter learning that Matthews was somehow in on everything via Harry from the very beginning. The show even set it up to be that way over the past couple of seasons, but then nothing happened with that at all. Same with all the other supporting characters. I get that the show was mainly about Dexter, but the audience received zero closure on everything else.

6. That final scene...you know, the one where Dexter is now Wolverine?! I guess I understand the self-imposed exile, after what happened to Deb. However, the last few episodes leading up to the finale were all about Dexter remarking on how he didn't even really have the urge to kill anymore, and he just wanted to spend time with his new family and build a life with them. I don't understand how all that vanished after Deb, and how abandoning his son seemed like the only way to go.

So there you have it. I am still reeling after watching the finale and am super bummed. I feel like the producers really let the audience down. Dexter himself let me down, too. He just kind of threw in the towel at the end. So un-Dexterlike, and not at all what his sister Deb would have wanted.",1379894400,56,3308,4.420361247947455
5864317,1,B00DXP7L88,"As a fan of Dexter from season one, this final chapter was profoundly disappointing. It's not like the warning signs weren't there; from the fifth season this show has been in a nosedive in terms of writing and execution (if you'll forgive the pun). The subtlety and nuance started giving way to clunky expository dialogue, with characters being written in and out so quickly they built no sense of danger or threat.

I had hoped season eight may have put an end to the suffering inflicted on viewers in recent years. Finally, here was the writers' moment to shine; what thrilling episodes could we look forward to? Since the very beginning, the show has flirted with the notion that Dexter would one day be exposed and if not caught then certainly on the run. Doakes was the finest example of that, and who could forget Trinity showing up unannounced at Miami Metro? The two questions fans have had for years are: when will Deb find out, and when will Dexter's secret become known?

The first question was already answered, and I naturally assumed that this final chapter would be the story that answers the second. Things seemed to be heading in that direction with a new super-detective, and episode one was whetting my appetite. What happened next and throughout the season was inexplicable. Dexter is not exposed and doesn't need to evade anyone. Instead, we get a bizarre background story and then a series of characters who are written in and killed off with absolutely no consequence whatsoever.

Harry the expository ghost is drafted in to spoon feed the audience what a better show would leave for the audience to put together themselves. Then we get Dexter's inner narrative, which by now has become a unintended comedy element for the frankly insulting way it's used to state the obvious or explain the story like we're incapable of figuring it out. Such repetitive tedium speaks only of the disdain the writers must have for the show and the viewers.

The plot is absurd, and mostly pointless, and by the end of the show we're in almost the same place we were several episodes previously, such is the way in which nothing that happens has an effect. Screen time is wasted on dull side-stories involving secondary characters which aimlessly bore the viewer until they're dropped with no resolution at all.

The final episode is particularly excruciating. Story lines are simply abandoned or resolved with childlike dialogue to the extent I was half expecting Harrison to have a credit as a co-writer. The episode gracelessly lurches from one necessary plot point to another, which boils down to how many times the same characters can attempt the same journey. Ultimately, the story ends with the option almost nobody wanted to see. The show's finest actor (Jennifer Carpenter) is written out with what's essentially an off-screen death by way of a button flick, all secondary characters simply never appear again, and in one especially painful scene, Hannah comes to learn of Dexter's fate on her tablet, and doesn't seem especially bothered. At the very end, Dexter breaks the fourth wall in a way that would be more effective if that's what he hadn't been doing in every opening credit sequence since the show began.

This final chapter is the empty husk that remains after the soul of what was once magnificent television has been removed over the course of four long years before our very eyes. It's a shell of its former self, and the feeling this dog's dinner of a conclusion leaves you with more than anything is sadness; sadness that the writers didn't even have it in them to give the characters the send off they deserved. This review is for the FINAL season of this show, not the show as a whole, which would get a 4.5 stars if it ended half way through it's lifespan but deserves 3 because of what it became. This season should be grateful for the single star it deserves.",1379894400,14,3896,4.781575037147102
5864318,3,B00DXP7L88,"I'm wasn't sure whether Season 6 or Season 8 is the worst Dexter season.  It's pretty close.  But the more I think about it, at least Season 6 had a developed villain and a great ending. This season had a great first five episodes, but went into a non-suspenseful direction, where eventually I just didn't care what happened.  Overall, Dexter should have just ended at the end of Season 7 with Debra killing Dexter instead of LaGuerta (which through some editing could actually be the ending, because they show that alternate Season 7 ending in episode 4).",1379894400,5,556,4.711340206185567
5864319,5,B00DXP7L88,"I am not sure what show the negative reviewers have been watching this season, but the final season of Dexter is nothing short of brilliant.

Why end Dexter the way they did? Read on:

The story of Dexter and what makes it so compelling is the journey he has been on. For eight incredible seasons we have witnessed him battle with his 'dark passenger' and watched as the dark passenger's grip weakened over time as Dexter needed less of the justice of the kills Harry and Evelyn built into Dexter as a self regulating 'code' system.

When Dexter finally lost that all important last person he cared about (and WOW was that a tearjerker of a scene), going on with a life like everyone else's was no longer an option. Dexter now realized it was NEVER an option. No matter how much he wanted that new life with Hannah and Harrison in Argentina, it was simply impossible now that he had to come to grips with all the people close to him who died because of who he is.

Dexter knows that even suicide can never be payment enough for the debt of him being who he is. When Dexter stares into the camera that final time, the absolute emptiness of a soul dead, a being emptied, his life and total existence ended is so much more powerful than anything else they could have come up with. It's now clear that even in spite of his living in the physical sense, he is dead in every way. He cannot have a life. Any life, even as the Dexter we knew before his journey of discovery led him to his ultimate sad fate. Now, if that isn't a proper ending for Dexter, I don't know what is. Saying goodbye to a tv character has never been so gut-wrenchingly sad.

In many ways it's justice that some, though they still rooted for him, hoped for and it's a proper philosophical end for him. It was a struggle the whole way, you just knew it wasn't going to be a picture perfect happy ending, and it certainly wasn't going to be a stereotypical Hollywood style ending with his being discovered and brought to justice or killed by those involved with the discovery. The team of writers and producers and everyone involved deserves a high level of praise and respect for everything they have done throughout the series, and yes, that includes the finale. Dexter may very well be the greatest series ever. It opened up a world of emotion for a dark character no one could imagine possible before. The creative team and actors deserve to win every award they are nominated for.

As for me, I'm going to plug in season 1, disc 1 into the DVD player and start the journey with Dexter all over again....",1379894400,38,2572,4.404210526315789
5864320,1,B00DXP7L88,"Dexter Season 8 should serve as a lesson in not rushing a season out less than a year after a previous one has ended. Especially if it's supposed to be the end of a much loved series. How can you even write/film/produce a good season in that time? I think Showtime is as much to blame as the writers for putting them on such a hectic schedule knowing it was meant to be the end. Season 8 was cliche, lame, ridiculous and horrible all at once. A sharp decline from Season 7, which started bringing back the intensity of earlier seasons. An even sharper decline from the unique amazing show 'Dexter' began life as in Season 1. Season 8 was generic TV writing filler for fans of other generic American shows. So no doubt the people that loved it, got into this show when it became cool to like this show, so they never appreciated how refreshing it was from all the other crap on TV back when it was starting out. Dexter used to have it's own vibe and it's own unique quirks and great story lines, with lots of attention to detail. Season 8 was tacky and sloppy beyond belief, there was zero attention to detail...Just a total screw you to fans that have supported this show for so many years.",1379894400,7,1190,4.3408071748878925
5864321,1,B00DXP7L88,"I am sitting here trying to find an explanation for what the writers of this series did with the last season. I was a HUGE fan of this series. Dexter, together with Breaking Bad were the two best series I have ever watched, but then they had to ruin Dexter in Season 8. The problems started early, since right from the beginning of the season the episodes were dull and boring. Dexter was a different character and things were moving really slow. It felt like the writers did not really know where the story was going and with each episode they were changing their mind. This left us with a bland and unsatisfying plot.

Of course, there was no way I was going to stop watching one of my favorite shows, so I kept plugging away and watching each week. At the end of each episode I would feel like things were wrong, but I did not want to believe that things were this bad. Surely they were going to find a way to make it up to us and to deliver a grand finale that would make us forget. And indeed they did, but not in the way I was expecting. They gave us a final episode that does not make us forget their mistakes, they gave us one that makes us want to forget this season even existed.

I have a hard time to believe that fans of this series can be satisfied with this final season. It did not have even a hint of what made me love this series for many years, and felt truly like an afterthought. The ending is as anti-climatic and bland as one can be. I am truly baffled.

5864322,1,B00DXP7L88,"The last episode was so disappointing, almost felt like it deserved another season to really sum things up in whole. the ending should have went like this, dexter and Deborah get caught somehow for involvement in laguertas death, and everyone finds out who dexter is and all he's done, even framing dobts the ""bay harbor butcher"", they get found out after debs already shot and brain dead in the hospital, dexters on the run and during the commotion for the storm in the hospital dexter sneaks to get deb and take her off life support and takes her out on the boat to dump her in the ocean because he cant let her live like that, just as in earlier seasons he killed that one lady/friend that worked with him, with the key lime pie she wanted. dexter kisses deb on the lips while holding her right before dumping her over the boat into the water, maybe almost finally realizing he may had felt some feelings for her after all, since they explored deb being in love with dexter and didn't really go anywhere with it. deb sinks into the water, everyone knows who dexter really is and what he has done being the bay harbor butcher and such, he cant go join Hannah and Harrison in Argentina because he realizes from deb dying that he needs to protect them from himself because everyone he loved has died, so he drives into the storm to die but survives and instead of him being some lumber jack looking person at the end they should of shown him in another country not Argentina in a kill room with someone and he says something like he may not be able to protect the ones he loves/loved but at least he can keep the monsters at bay. the he stabs them and looks up smiling at the camera, then black screen and the end. and maybe something to suggest he finally feels feelings, except the ones he feels in the end are the ones the people he loved felt, like deb he feels her pain, I mean they left so much, unfinished, and made a lot they explored in the past 3 seasons look irrelevant also. it was sloppy to say the best, I love dexter but the last episode wrapping everything up was poorly written.

5864323,5,B00DXP7L88,"I just finished watching the final episode of Dexter. I must admit it was an emotional rollercoaster. I won't go into details about the ending. I don't want to be that person who ruins it for someone who hasn't been able to sit down and watch the final episode. Having Dexter on television was truly a Sunday night treat. We got to sit back and watch Dexter grow as a man,friend,father,killer,lover,husband,and just a person in general. Dexter goes from a man who makes calculated and cold decisions and turns out to be the emotional being that he/we thought he never could become. The ending to season eight concluded leaving me feeling very sad and joyous at the same time. Although it was bittersweet, it was still lovely to watch Dexter become a caring being. In the end he makes the ultimate sacrifice.....his most mature decision yet. The decision to put someone else's happiness before his own. To literally just......walk away. Although it's over, I feel like it ended on a good note. I am aware that some fans say the show lost steam throughout the seasons, but I must disagree with that. Almost every episode kept me on the edge of my seat. I found myself clenching the sides of the couch, being fearful when Dexter made bad decisions and even fast forwarding a few minutes ahead to make sure that Dexter would walk away from the current intense moment unscathed. Don't worry. I would always rewind and rewatch the scene soon as I knew Dexter was okay. I loved every season, every moment, and every Sunday night of Dexter. I would even have to remind myself that ""This is just a TV show"" as I watched with extreme intensity. The writers were brilliant and Michael C Hall along with Jennifer Carpenter created a wonderful vibe. What other show would make you want to root for a serial killer? And as a side note I was so happy that Jennifer and Michael remained professional and had a great connection even after the divorce. Any who, Dexter will be greatly missed. I never loved a show like I loved Dexter and I highly doubt I will get deeply attached to another show after this.

RIP Dexter,
Thank you for the wonderful times.

5864324,1,B00DXP7L88,"Let's face it, Dexter ended in Season 7. That was it. Ten-four, over and out...

Season 8 is just an ""expansion pack"" or cheesey ""add-on"" of a season. It really has no relevance to anything that was going on in the series, whatsoever. It reminds me of a really, really BAD sequel to a great movie that bears no resemblance to the original.

Here's the rundown of every episode in season 8:

First, they talk about stuff at Dexter's house.
Then, they talk about stuff at the beach.
Later that day, they talk about even more stuff at the police station.
Ancillary character dies...
Then they talk about stuff at a Cuban restaurant.
Que useless excuse of a plot twist that nobody cares about to add suspense that just isn't there anymore.

Rinse and repeat.

Season 8 really is just a typical boring soap opera. Nothing happens. Nobody really does anything. They just sit or stand around talking about ""stuff & things"" the entire time. No ""edge of your seat"" suspense. No clever plot twists. Nadda. The cast just hangs out and talks about newly introduced prop characters and relationships of third string characters who are so useless, most people still can't remember their names after 8 seasons.

And yes, I'm writing this just before the last episode airs. The fact is though, I don't care anymore. I really didn't care if Gilbert's wedding went off without a hitch in ""Revenge of the Nerds part 2: Nerds in Love"". I didn't really care how Jason Bateman's dating status would be at the end of ""Teen Wolf Too"" either. And I really don't care where the pawned off, watered down and excruciatingly boring version of Dexter will be at the end of this ""bonus season"".

Season 8 introduces so many wooden, disposable characters like Dr. Vogul, Zack and ""that brain surgeon guy"" and so many ridiculous, out of character plot twists (Deb's a crack head wait, no she's not... Argentina? Seriously?) that it's not even fit for -- NBC. Yea, it's that bad...

Season 8 could not have been any worse if it were done entirely with sock puppets. At least then, it may have been mildly entertaining; if only for a few minutes.

Season 8 really is one of the biggest let downs in television history. I never though a 5 star show like Dexter would end like this. A serial killer who ends the story by boring everyone to death.",1379721600,19,2309,4.598540145985401
