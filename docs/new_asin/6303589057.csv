7851735,5,6303589057,A warm and well defined approach to rich and wonderful AMERICAN music in the genres of jazz and marches.  I discussed with my students the details of my own career in jazz in New York City and they wowed at how I had been so close to becoming a jazz singer with the possibility of narrating historic evidence of the effect of jazz on the world of music.  All parents and teachers may choose to engage their families in the discussion topics so aptly shared by our own gifted Wynton Marsalis.  If you are trying to help your children understand all of the fuss about jazz...try using this video to help de-mystify some of what we can all learn and appreciate about these two art forms: jazz and marching music.  Thanks for sharing!,1379376000,,730,4.466165413533835
7851736,5,6303589057,I am a music teacher and I use this DVD when I cover my Jazz Unit for older students in my class.  This DVD can be seen again and again and you still will be learning new ideas each time you watch.  Wynton is an excellent teacher and you can't get any better than Ozawa and his conducting!!!,1240704000,,291,4.0

The history of the development of early jazz is good stuff, too, though.  It's all done through musical  examples and is just as good for kids as it is for practicing musicians.  Worth your dollar.",943920000,8,311,4.385964912280702
