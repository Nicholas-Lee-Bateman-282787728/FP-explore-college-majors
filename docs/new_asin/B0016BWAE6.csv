Definitely check it out ... just wish it had continued.",1328659200,,152,4.62962962962963
3156055,5,B0016BWAE6,"If you have any sense of humor (dry, raunchy or harsh) then this near G-Rated series is by far one of the best TV shows ever.

Compare it to MODERN FAMILY, FRAZIER and CHELSEA LATELY.  Now that makes no sense!  I even see 'Raising Hope' humor here.

Always a smile on your face and I can watch it over and over.

3156056,5,B0016BWAE6,I loved this tv when it was on the air and was sad to see it go when it did. Great improv comedy! With some added extra features. If you love the Office you will love this show.,1321142400,,177,3.6842105263157894
3156057,5,B0016BWAE6,"10 Items or Less was my Mom's favorite show and she watched it whenever it came on tv. Then, it suddenly was canceled, so we looked in all the stores, but none of them had it. I logged on to amazon and found it right away!! My Mom loves it and she was overjoyed. It's really easy to find stuff on amazon and it's always guaranteed to have what you're looking for.",1290729600,2,363,4.055555555555555
3156058,5,B0016BWAE6,"Like many, I had heard of the show but had not caught any episodes when it was on the air.  I bought this on an Amazon impulse spree, and do not regret it in the least.  Painfully funny at times, and intelligently stupid (think of a lighter/less cynical sibling to The Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm, ... paced more in line with Arrested Development, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia), the series should easily make it onto non-laugh track comedy lovers' lists.",1267574400,,460,4.7375
3156059,5,B0016BWAE6,"Ok, this show is HILARIOUS! I never used to like sitcoms but now they are some of my favorite shows and this one is no exception. About 95% of the show takes place in a grocery store between the employees and manager. I don't know what to say besides it's really funny!

This program is really original for a few reasons. According to the special features all the dialogue is improvised. The plot isn't but the dialogue is! And it's hilarious! Also, when the actors came in to audition for the show they didn't really know what it was, some of them assumed it was a reality show. So they walk in and are handed a job application for a grocery store to fill out, and turns out that's how their characters were created, off of that job application!

I loved all the characters and actors they all bring something hilarious to the show. From the overly friendly but sort of unrealistic manager, to the awkward stock boy, to the manager of the rival big box grocery store. These people riff off each other so well!

The seasons are very short, each fitting on one dvd packaged together for purchase. It's just funny stuff!",1242518400,8,1118,4.470588235294118
3156060,3,B0016BWAE6,"when I ordered this dvd I expected the antics of the office and what i got was 2/3's of an episode building towards one not so very funny moment. If you are looking for a show as funny as the office,this is not it. Its an okay show, but it shadows the office in comparison. It is  overall its average,still worth watching though.",1235347200,6,329,4.222222222222222
3156061,5,B0016BWAE6,"I first heard about 10 Items or Less a few months ago. I don't get cable television, so I'm not on a first run basis with many of the shows that are not on basic cable. In my opinion, I'm not missing much, but 10 Items or Less is exceptional. If you like The Office, you're probably going to like, if not love, 10 Items or Less. If you like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, you're probably going to like, if not love, 10 Items or Less. If you feel like The Office has lost its spark, that the relationships between the characters are no longer believable, or that the characters themselves have become unlikable, then 10 Items or Less is good for what ails you. If you think that It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has turned its main characters into psychopaths that you are no longer laughing with, but wondering why they're not in prison, then 10 Items or Less will give you flawed, yes; deluded, yes, but nonetheless a cast of characters that are as endearing as they are funny. Check this one out! You won't be disappointed!",1232841600,12,1030,4.426315789473684

8262088,5,B0016BWAE6,Fantastic show. Part improv/part scripted and flawlessly executed. Funny and light-hearted.,1462492800,,91,7.363636363636363

8262090,3,B0016BWAE6,I was fooled by watching one good episode with a friend...  the majority of this show gets lame quick.  Character development is rather weak.,1434844800,,141,4.833333333333333

8262092,3,B0016BWAE6,It was good entertainment for the price. It had its moments. Although the Jesus stain on the wall episode was a carbon copy of an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I worked in a similar environment for many years and could relate to many of the circumstances they went through.,1427155200,,289,4.576923076923077

8262094,4,B0016BWAE6,I enjoyed this show.  The cast worked well improving off each other.  Would recommend if you like off beat comedies.,1369785600,,116,4.75
8262095,5,B0016BWAE6,This show is very funny. The premise is fun and you quickly like the cast and the grocery store humor that follows. Anyone that worked retail will get a kick out of this and I think it is appealing to the masses. It definitely stays in my personal collection. I put it away for a year and laugh again . Its great.,1366070400,,313,4.064516129032258
