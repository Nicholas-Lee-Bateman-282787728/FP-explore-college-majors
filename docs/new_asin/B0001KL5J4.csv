8013667,5,B0001KL5J4,"The Yankeeography series of DVDs certainly fills the void left behind in the long dark cold winter months. I purchased this and Vol 2 last year to get me through the ""off season"" and I wasn't disappointed.

I'm not as much a fan of other sports, but when it comes to baseball, I get to be quite obsessed. I have been a Yankee fan since I can remember, growing up on Long Island, and having Yankee fans as parents, aunts, uncles and cousins. Living here in PA, I don't have access to the YES Network, so I don't get to see the numerous showings of Yankeeography on cable. Thanks go out to YES for offering them on DVD.

The Yankeeography series packs a lot of information into a 40 minute format. I have gained newfound knowledge on many of my favorite players, and certainly learned much more about the old time players.

If you are a Yankee fan, or even a fan of baseball history, I advise purchasing the Yankeeography DVDs. I plan on purchasing the later installments. They are very well produced and will feed your baseball drought during the off season.",1130025600,5,1057,4.466321243523316

Even if you aren't into baseball, you may still enjoy watching what this DVD has to offer. Highly recommended.",1127088000,5,267,4.469387755102041
8013669,5,B0001KL5J4,"I love baseball, and I love the history of baseball. Therefore, I love the Yankees.

I'm not a New Yorker, or anything like that. It's just that you cannot love our national pastime without having some sort of affection for this team.

This DVD set is a collection of six 43-minute-long biographies of Yankee baseball greats. This inaugural set includes Ruth, Guidry, Munson, Mattingly, Jeter and Joe Torre.

Before I gush torrentially over this set, I must be honest. The video, even during modern sequences, was jittery on rare occasion. The sound was fine. The usage of the same clips over and over again became minimally irritating.

Having said that, here starts the gush-o-rama. The hour on Ruth sums up his mercurial, singular career about as well as one could do when limited by time. There is a lot of terrific footage, some great talking-head interviews with his contemporaries, and afterwards you have a better idea of exactly how HUGE he was to the sport, and to America. It's no surprise his name stills carries the weight that it does.

The hour on Guidry took me by surprise. Placed into proper perspective, I had no idea how scary good he was, and that one year of his (1978) may very well be the single best year any pitcher has ever had...Bob Gibson might be close. I found myself really liking this guy Guidry, and hearing him tell his stories with that Louisiana lilt was a real kick.

I also gained a further appreciation for Thurman Munson. He died while I was in junior high, and I remember it being a bit shocking. Now it feels tragic. I found myself inspired when learning about how his teammates dealt with the loss of their team captain. I also wish I could see more of him playing baseball...he was a player from a bygone age who played like a player from a previously bygone age.

How the heck did I miss Don Mattingly? After seeing his bio, the first thing I did was set out to find an autographed baseball of his. What a fine baseball player, and what a class act. Watching him play was a joy, and I can only imagine what it must have been like to see him live in action. This hour gives you a sense of that.

Honestly, it's a bit too early to do something on Jeter. His story is half-told, but that first half sure is a corker!

The hour on Joe Torre was the most moving of them all. What he underwent, on the road to his first World Series, sounds biblical. A straight account of the events that led to and surrounded by his hiring by the Yanks and that first Series victory was impressive enough, but hearing the testimonials from those around him was awe-inspiring. Here's one of the great managers of our era, and possibly of all time. This hour alone is worth the purchase of the set.

The disc of extras is worth skimming. There are clips from the various players presented in their entirety, or at least in an expanded state. Bits of interviews, raw footage...it's a fun hodge-podge of stuff.

After completing this DVD package, I immediately ordered the next two, pre-ordered Volume 4, bought some more autographed baseballs and started seeking out books on the players, wanting to know more.

You have been warned: buying this DVD is gonna cost you!

This is one of my favorite purchases of the last year, and any baseball fan will be happy to have this in their collection, right next to Ken Burns' opus and ""When It Was A Game.""",1121212800,22,3371,4.50655737704918
