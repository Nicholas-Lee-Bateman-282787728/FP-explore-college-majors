2107414,1,B0002MSQ7U,"I have been watching the TV commercials for their latest pitch on their DVD product. I will admit that the 30 minutes infomercial looks quite appealing. I then decided to look at previous reviews and do a little detective work on Ralph Paul....could not find anything on who this person is. Therefore, I went to their Facebook page and posted the following message:

""where can I find a bio on Ralph Paul. Can't find it on Google, nothing on ralphpaul.com and nothing on your Facebook page (which you just started in November 2012). Sorry to say but for a ""legendary guitarist/best teacher"" self-description, it sure sounds suspicious.""

Nothing happened. I went to work, and about 12 hours later, I decided to find out if their FB page had posted anything regarding my comment. Well, sorry to say but TRUTH BE KNOWN... My post was not there and evidently was deleted.

This outcome is too bad because I was very close on purchasing the DVD collection until then. If you are professional then you reply professionally even if the customer is ignorant about the matter. I wrote in a diplomatic and professional way yet they did not have the decency to reply and educate the customer. YOU LOSE! Move on and don't look back.

In the business world, you reply to the customer's inquiry. If you do what they did, you must infer that this is a scam and EVERYTHING else that sounds positive (like You Tube reviews, etc.) is made up by the company that sells this product. I am just sorry that this didn't work out because I have been looking into guitar lessons quite seriously.

So, there you go. Ralph Paul: show yourself and respond INTELLIGENTLY to a reasonable customer's question.",1357084800,83,1679,4.716723549488054
2107415,1,B0002MSQ7U,"To even consider purchasing this you must be either hopeless or pathetic. Anyone who's played the guitar even slightly seriously can see within one of his ""demonstrations"" that he's a complete hack. If you're this desperate to learn a few cheesy basic ""riffs"" on guitar then I would suggest going to YouTube for free. I as well learned of this through a late night infomercial and found it funny at first then became sickened. I've been playing guitar for a long time and would be upset if anyone I cared about gave money to this pinprick just to learn useless methods and bad techniques.",1356739200,40,588,4.663461538461538
2107416,1,B0002MSQ7U,Who is this guy? To think he can teach music in 5 minutes is pathetic! Please don't waste your money.,1356480000,16,101,4.1
2107417,1,B0002MSQ7U,"""Ralph Paul"" Acerno is not a guitar legend at all, but a preacher from N.J. In fact he's a complete unknown who can barely play the guitar, let alone be ""America's Best Teacher."" He made a video and bought airtime hawking this junk. And it IS junk. I have 2 degrees in music and have played around the country. America has no ""best guitar teacher"" recognition... (John Abacrombie anyone?). The videos I've seen are filled with errors, both factual, and technical.

If I can keep one person from buying this...and seek out a real teacher...I've done my job.

I've not bought this, or would I ever... The 20 min of footage I've seen proves its a amateur hack job.",1355529600,98,661,4.546218487394958

2107420,1,B0002MSQ7U,"One of my greatest problems when teaching students is getting them to ""unlearn"" bad habits and technique.
this guy will install incorrect information in new players that will prevent their ability to advance in their studies of the guitar.
It is sad because he is in it to make some fast money, teach people how to play something on the guitar and not teach them how to play the guitar.
my advise, go find a teacher who will spend time with you, and correct your mistakes.
I tell my students, give me 5 mins two to three times a day for two weeks. no more or your fingers will hurt too much. then move up to 10 mins for the next month, etc.
10 mins twice a day is 2 hours a week. (6 days).
you cannot learn to play in 5 mins.",1383782400,44,725,4.076923076923077

If this was the best way to teach guitar, everyone would teach this way. (Why teach second best)

Didn't let you verify or change anything plus it bills 2 shipping charges up front. Tried cancelling the order in customer service as soon as the order was placed but was only given a run around. I filed a complaint with my bank as soon as I was charged. I refused the order when it was received and they did give me some credit back but billed me a $6.95 shipping and handling.

Always was and always will be a scam artist. One of those people who can look you right in the eye and smile while doing it. Somehow managed to scam his way through  Bible College, Seminary, and now  as a ""Pastor"" he's capitalizing on the whole UFO thing. Personally I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him.

I bought the original plus their 2 disc blues and the parts 3 and 4 of the rock set.  I didn't receive the blues discs or the parts 3 and 4 of the rock set, but I DID get charged for them.  Not to mention that the ""39.95"" dvd set was damaged with the first dvd scratched either during shipping or, more likely, by the damaged plastic jewel case it came it.

Learning the guitar takes two things; hours and hours of practice and lessons from someone who not only knows how to play, but also how to teach. Just ask yourself this. If you have a question, and I guarantee you you will, who's going to answer it?  This guy is nothing but a hack and a charlatan. Anyone who goes down for his B.S. deserves exactly what they get.
