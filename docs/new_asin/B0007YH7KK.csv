DVD is region 2 so I simply connected an old DVD drive out of a dead tower PC via USB to my laptop, re-assigned it's region to 2, and then connected my laptop via HDMI to my TV. The Toy Dolls are not your typical UK ""Punk"" band with songs full of angst, political themes, calls for anarchy,... Their music is punk, upbeat, skilled, and varied. The lyrics are fun, positive, and very entertaining. Also of note, their choices of cover tunes. Specifically Toccata in Dm, Sabre Dance, and The Entertainer. If you do not know what these songs are do not look them up. Listen to The Toy Dolls versions first. You will likely recognize at least one of them whereas if you look them up they might sound less appealing. The Toy Dolls rock them and their original material is great too. Since it is not likely that a Toy Dolls concert is going to be held in my area anytime soon, this DVD brought the concert right into my living room. Now I am seeking out some of their CDs.",1486252800,,1109,4.260663507109005
