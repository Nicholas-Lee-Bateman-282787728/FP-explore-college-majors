6401954,5,B00K320KJQ,"We got this for my son who is Autistic, he has been enjoying doing his music time every day. The man on the video that leads the songs has a very soothing voice, though out the video he talks to the kids, giving them instructions to be able to play along. The color and pace of the video is very stable, so it does not have any ups or downs in tempo or volume, making it easier on my sons sensory aversion. Every other song involves large or fine motor skills, this alternation of the big and small movement keeps my child engaged. After the hour long music time my son has calmed down quite a bit and much more relaxed. The bonus cd is fun for us to bring along in the car so we can sing and listen as we drive.

6401955,5,B00K320KJQ,"This DVD and CD are great for kids with special needs, especially if you have some instruments like tambourines and maracas to use.  It looks like this also comes as a complete kit with instruments and a songbook too.

6401956,5,B00K320KJQ,"The music, instruction, and approach provided by The Rhythm Tree's kit has been an enormous blessing to my six year old daughter.  She has such a love for music that it has been the most powerful tool to overcome her many developmental disabilities.  The vast majority of the medical, therapy, and education providers in my daughter's life have been women, so I also think it is invaluable that she reaps the benefit of Ryan Judd as a healer in her life.  He uses humor and drama and pacing that is different than the other therapists/teachers/doctors.  It allows an avenue for her to express herself with Ryan in ways that are not prompted as often with women.",1421366400,,661,4.672413793103448

I especially appreciate all the ideas for Tapping My Sticks.  ""Where is Thumbkin gives me a refreshing new approach to this age-old favorite, and the kids are engaged. Mr. Judd gives helpful prompting and carry-over suggestions as well. Thank you!!",1473206400,,377,5.080645161290323
8655599,5,B00K320KJQ,Arrived on time and in perfect condition. This is a must have for special needs preschoolers or even typical toddlers. My daughter with ds loves it and plays along with the songs and games.,1470700800,,189,4.588235294117647
8655600,5,B00K320KJQ,"DVD arrived timely, in addition the creator of the DVD contacted me to provide the pdf songbooks and make sure I didn't have any questions about the program. The songs teach a lot of basic interactions that may or may not come easily for special needs children like waving and saying ""hi"" which I hope will help my child learn to interact more appropriately with other kids his age.",1468800000,,382,4.550724637681159
8655601,5,B00K320KJQ,"I was searching for Music Therapy DVDs for my child that has autism and other special needs. My son connects through music in such a beautiful way. In fact, as I've learned through working with the special needs community, many children with special needs connect and learn through music. It opens up a whole different part of their brain.  Typical children can benefit as well. My son has learned a multitude of things through music. As one on one Music Therapy sessions can get rather expensive, I was searching for alternatives to help me implement these strategies myself.  I'm thrilled I came across this DVD. This is not a DVD you just sit your child in front of and walk away. This is meant for you to engage with your child. That is the best part, in my opinion.  Great thought was put into this DVD.  My son, and my other two children have loved this as an addition to our homeschool music class time.  You do need to have instruments on hand.  I love that they show you ways to make some, and adapt them to be easily used to the level of ability of your child.  Music Therapy and concepts can be used to teach so much, and the DVD helps show you many ways. I did receive this DVD at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.",1457827200,2,1239,4.337662337662338
8655602,5,B00K320KJQ,"I came upon this dvd/cd package while looking for songs to use with my two sons who have autism.  I ordered it and I was surprised to receive an email from the creator and host of the dvd himself, inquiring if I had received my order and if I had any questions.  I was impressed with his professionalism and how much he cared about his product and his work.  I was impressed with the dvd as well.  I found the songs to be catchy and the simplicity and repetition aide in learning the songs quickly.  My sons enjoyed watching the dvd because they love music and watching the children joining in with the movements and playing instruments.  After ordering I found that there is another option in buying this dvd/cd with instruments as well and I suggest looking at both options before purchasing.  This DVDs shows how to present music to special children and there is also a section where Ryan instructs on how to adapt instruments to the child's needs which I found very helpful.  What  I also love about this music program is the actual inclusion of children of all abilities enjoying the music class.
I highly recommend this product and suggest searching the net for the rhythmn tree to find a sample of what's on the dvd.",1447977600,5,1223,4.5227272727272725
8655603,5,B00K320KJQ,"We used the DVD today for the first time with our grandchildren. Our grandson is 6 and has autism. He watched the first few songs and played the instruments with alittle help. It was exciting to see him engaged. Our 2 yr old granddaughter loved it! She was even singing along to the songs and asked for more when it was over.  This is something you can do with them. We can't wait to use it again. It was nice to see them sit long enough to watch, that usually doesn't happen.  Music really is magic.",1445558400,6,500,4.197916666666667
8655604,5,B00K320KJQ,"This video is very positive, engaging, and I think that all children could enjoy it. Its great that the tone of the video was calm, soothing, and constant. That, I can see, would be very beneficial for children with special needs.

Its DVD is a collection of songs that allows the viewer to see how a music therapy group session takes place. This DVD came with a CD too, that included all the songs. I prefer to use the CD and engage the children myself, because sometimes videos can be a little distracting. That allows me to get the most of the product.

I loved the special features aspect on the DVD. They have selections to make a drum, sandpaper blocks, rubber band harp, and how to adapt the instruments. It's a very practical way of allowing people to play along without having to spend a fortune on real instruments. Also, he mentions that making the instruments with your kid can be beneficial to their motor development. He does tell the adult viewer which parts are okay for the children to help along with, with safety in mind, Awesome!

I was given this product for an honest review, the feedback I give is my own.",1443571200,,1128,4.492682926829269
8655605,4,B00K320KJQ,"This DVD is cute. It is a video taping of a music therapy class. It shows how an instructor engages the children of the class through a series of songs and actions.

Pros:
The instructor is a warm friendly person. He does his best to engage very child at their own level. The gongs are sung slowly so he can articulate each word. This is important to help develop speech. The children I showed this DVD to, had lots of fun following along.

Cons:
You need to have a set of musical instruments.
This is not a DVD in which the children can sit and watch. You need to be present for the interacting songs to get the most of this DVD.
This may seem silly, but I was a little upset that the title of the songs were spelled out and not verbalized. I have noticed many special needs children cannot read. It would be beneficial for them to say the title of the songs so the children can verbalize their favorites.

Putting the few cons aside, this DVD has a lot of potential. When I supplied some instruments, the children did enjoy playing along and having fun. The extra CD is a huge plus. The songs are great for the kids on car rides or in school. A cute set to have.

I received this music DVD set in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are mine and were in no way influenced by outside sources. I am a professional blogger at [...]",1442016000,4,1338,4.21484375
