1986207,2,B0001BMLW8,"As an avid Stargate SG-1 fan, I decided to spend a few dollars and purchase this DVD. My expectations were low, and were definitely never challenged by the episodes. My young siblings (ages 3-8) enjoyed the show, and found it more entertaining than Stargate SG-1.
This is not Stargate SG-1 canon. The producers of the hit sci-fi show have nothing to do with this DVD or cartoon series. MGM owns the rights, and decided to make a cartoon. As such, they not only ignore the story lines made in Stargate SG-1, but also the continuity laid down in the feature film! After only thirty years, the Goa'uld have apparently been wiped out, replaced with beasts resembling Bebop and Rocksteady from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Staff weapons only stun, rather than cauterize. Stargates can be entered from either side, rather than the restriction of being allowed to enter only from the side the glyphs were pressed.
The animation was at par with most other cartoons striving for realism on a budget. I don't notice many corner being cut in terms of animating the characters on the screen. Lips are shown quite often, and body movements are overall fluid. Voice acting is hit and miss: most are typical cartoon fare.
The title sequence is painful to watch. It's definitely low budget: the wailing man singing the lyrics for the theme doesn't help much either. The music is definitely forgettable (or scarring, as in the case of the theme song).
Where this show fails most is in the pacing. The editing of scenes is horrible in these episodes. Characters take too long looking at each other before responding, and the action is broken up quite a bit with scenes of useless dialogue and body animation. Things don't mesh well together. Quite often there are scenes of the cast simply staring at each other. I suppose this is intended for children to grasp what is being said, to avoid losing their attention.
What bothered my sisters were the way the women are portrayed in this show. Most have shaved heads, facial tattoos, and multiple piercings. My sisters wanted to identify with the characters, and were unnerved that most looked quite strange.
In the end, none of these problems really affected the viewers (my siblings). They sat in front of the television entranced by a show similar to my favorite, yet geared for them. As for the adults, don't purchase it to be entertained. It's definitely a novelty, and should be considered as such.",1078876800,135,2434,4.81145584725537
1986208,5,B0001BMLW8,"Stargate Infinity carries on thirty years in the future from when the original team entered the Stargate and now a new team must protect an Ancient from a new enemy. Because of this, this release features none of the original characters. Despite this,  it does hold up very well as a stand alone series and offers great animation, a strong plotline and interesting characters. Even younger Stargate fans may enjoy the different viewpoint to the series. I would recommend this release to any animation and Stargate fans.",1075852800,8,519,4.9655172413793105
1986209,1,B0001BMLW8,"i haven't bought this title yet but have seen the episodes off the TV. I have to say unless your a die-hard stargate fan, a
kid with a real imagination or realy bored then don't buy this! Since im a fan of stargate then i will be buying this ;), basically its a cartoon mockery of Sg1 and the producers of sg1 has said this is not worthy of our stargate franchise.  FOREVER STARGATE! and ATLANTIS SOON !

8009624,2,B0001BMLW8,"It does have aspects of the Stargate SG-1 series,But it leaves alot to be desired. I would like if it had the voices of Amanda Tapping,Michael Shanks,Richard Dean Anderson. Likeness of these actors,more introductions of how they got that far, who & why their foes hate them more. 3 stories left me wanting more. I am a big fan of Stargate & still want the game to come out on XBox 360.",1425945600,,385,4.361111111111111
8009625,5,B0001BMLW8,the condition was great when came and the movie is a good movie for young kids.  i think that there are 2 movies on this.,1392854400,,121,3.84

I wonder how many people got ripped off?",1263772800,3,181,3.891891891891892

8009629,4,B0001BMLW8,"So maybe it's not EXACTLY like the TV series, but it's still pretty good.  I didn't have any trouble playing this on either of my DVD players, and it was fun and nostalgic. Definitely glad I bought it.",1188259200,7,201,4.2894736842105265
8009630,4,B0001BMLW8,Its just a show for a  kid.  Its not an art form. If mom and dad are watching Stargate a child could watch this animated spin off.  This is something a seven year old can watch.  Its no better or worse vs Buzz Lightyear tv series.  The Buzz movies are much better. Better animated shows are out there but for $10.00 for 5 episodes its worth it.  Its just a cartoon spin off for gradeschool kids.  If your over that age watch the series.  Its not much better or worse than the japanese tv cartoons.  Thats all.,1095292800,14,509,4.164948453608248
8009631,4,B0001BMLW8,"This series was not an official series, and due to the timing of it's release, it does clash on some issues.  In the series (set ahead of the other two shows and so free of Goauld) we see a new team who have been framed for treason and are now gate hopping to keep ahead of the aliens responsible for the treason.  They also have an ancient, which is seen as a telepathic dragon like creature (this series came out before the ancients were revealed on SG-1 so I don't count that clash against them).  The series had good morals like any good cartoon should.  Granted some of the animation is cheesy, but there are a LOT of cartoons out there that are cheesy.  For pete's sake look at some of our ""Live Action"" stuff (Crouching Tiger..., Matrix, and Hero, tell me those aren't cheesy).  The show is a really good stepping stone for younger viewers too little to follow the story lines of SG-1 and Atlantis.  The show is cute, the characters may look different and some of the show is very cheesy but it is definitely a good show.  One of the best morals this show shares with SG-1 and Atlantis goes to those ranting about the cheesyness and unofficialness of it, DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER!!!!!!  Plus, anything with Jim Byrnes can't be all bad!",1094601600,11,1249,4.395652173913043
8009632,1,B0001BMLW8,"As an HUGE fan of the series, I have to warn you that this is nothing more than a cheap attempt to make a quick buck on a popular series. Its apparent from the very begining that the producers & writers for this cartoon series have NEVER seen a single episode of Stargate SG1. They DONT stick to the story line, the team looks like they escaped from the Galaxy High cartoon series from the mid 80s. The intro theme song could be used to torture prisoners & small animals. MGM should be ashamed of itself for allowing this series to be made. & heres a final fact about this series: the ONLY things it has in common with the Sci-Fi channel series, is A: the name Stargate, & B: the Stargate itself. & on a final note. for those of you who said this cartoon series features great animation, characters & stories, your either A: Employees of MGM, or B: Dont know what good animation is.
Final Verdict:
SG-1 Fans should AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!",1088208000,62,944,4.338983050847458
8009633,5,B0001BMLW8,"I thought this was really fun.  It reminded a lot of the cartoon shows that were on when I was young like King Arthur and the Knights of Justice, Wizard of Oz or Conan the Adventurer.  Most cartoons shows these days don't have any thought put behind their plot, but this one seems to.  Albeit, I've only watched the episodes on this disk, but each seems to build on the last while still being a good stand alone.
I think, perhaps, most people don't like because it calls itself Stargate, but what with all the aliens it doesn't jive with the Sg-1 series.  Although this is true, the issues the show deals are very those in SG-1.  In one episode a race of aliens is made sick, in another their bodies are duplicated by shape shifters.
All in all I thought it was very fun, no Gargoyles, but certainly than all this crap currently showing on the toon channels nowadays.",1083888000,7,867,4.39375
