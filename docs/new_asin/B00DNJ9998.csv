8594947,1,B00DNJ9998,"This was an awful film. I have watched a lot of slashers and I love most or take it as the way it was. This was low budget. It wasn't funny. I was real disappointed in this film. The killer was not scary he was a joke and a half. I may cry myself to sleep for buying this. Normally I give all slashers no less than 3 stars because in this it was just so bad.

  In this day and age where slashers are few I like to see the slasher films bad that will try to make a good slasher. The slasher genre is pretty dead you really have to search for the hidden gems.

  The acting was bad. I liked some of the girl's acting but the script was bad with bad lines and confusing story plot. writing I watched this movie the movie and actors tried. I don't recommend watching this even as a rental unless you can get a buck for it. I would pop in the movie Halloween instead the best slasher movie of all time.

  This movie is up there with one of the worst movies I've seen in the whole decade. Blair Witch the new one was only worse. I wish the actors and director good luck in trying again with another horror movie. This movie failed but a failure is just a try that didn't work out. Cheers",1520035200,,1183,3.957805907172996

8594949,1,B00DNJ9998,"The film looked like the crew had a fun time making this low budget film. Included in the 67 minutes of film is 8 minutes of a blooper reel and 7 minutes of introduction which included some ""poor poetry"" as Spock would jest. A group of young adults who run a haunted farm summon the Jack O Slasher to come take his annual 7 souls using ears of corn and pumpkin carving tools (the tiny plastic ones) as lethal weapons.

There are a lot of corny characters, but zero characterization just people walking through the corn maze getting killed by a man in a rubber pumpkin mask. It is also billed as a comedy and went all out for the cheese. Unfortunately they never adequately created a story to build the cheese around, instead read us a story which didn't create the needed character.

The humor was not great . It was juvenile and lacked any real good satire or even slapstick. It consisted of bad puns and attempts at being funny. The effects were too cheesy to be scary. The acting was bad too.

If the Dept. of Agriculture can pay farmers NOT to plant crops can't the Academy of the Arts pay people not to make films?
