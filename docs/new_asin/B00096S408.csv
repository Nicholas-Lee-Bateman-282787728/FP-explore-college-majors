2268232,5,B00096S408,"This is the BEST instructional video I have ever seen. She really DOES break down EVERYTHING in the routines and goes over it multiple times. THEN she adds the music to segments at a time. There is a beginner,intermediate,and advanced routine. I comepletely suggest it to ANYONE who wants to learn some hot moves.*I will warn you though* - It does go a bit fast,but as Laurie Ann says,you can ALWAYS go back and do it over again.",1134518400,6,429,4.512820512820513
2268233,2,B00096S408,"Gibson is a good dancer and choreographer, and is a decent teacher.  But My God...her voice is so GRATING and ANNOYING that I felt like throwing the TV out the window.  She sounds like JOAN RIVERS teaching a dance class.  I couldn't take it anymore.",1128556800,8,249,4.488888888888889
2268234,3,B00096S408,It helps to create new moves and style to dance hip-hop or other dance styles.,1125273600,3,78,4.266666666666667
2268235,3,B00096S408,it's an ok product.  laura goes through the routines way too fast 4 my taste.  she says u can always pause an replay but u have to replay it from the beginning of the routine.  if u practice a lot u will get it but it's not that easy.  i'm not sorry 4 making the purchase.,1123545600,9,272,3.8035714285714284
2268236,2,B00096S408,"This will teach you a few moves, I suppose, which is why I gave it 2 stars.  It was definitely very low budget and didn't really grab my attention.  Laurie Ann's personality is great but won't carry it through.",1122422400,,210,4.358974358974359
2268237,5,B00096S408,"I heard of this DVD through my best friend whos dad works at Universal, so I picked it up and it is AWESOME! I loved Laurie Ann from Makin the Band. The way she teaches the dance moves makes it really easy to learn the dance steps. Some of the moves look impossibly hard to do but she takes you step by step which was great. If you really like fun and upbeat dancing, you'll totally love this DVD because Laurie Ann teaches awesome hip hop moves infused with other styles like salsa, house, and reggae. I've seen other instructional dance DVDs before and this one was my favorite by far. Her dance style and the way she teaches is like no other choreographer I have seen. The DVD is also a great way to get in a fun aerobic workout. I recommend picking this up to not only learn the latest and greatest dance moves but also to just have fun! LOVED IT!",1121731200,5,851,4.195121951219512
2268238,5,B00096S408,"I purchased this video yesterday. I go to clubs a lot and got bored with my 1-2 Step. This video is great!! Laurie Ann is phenomenal teacher.  There's a begginner, intermediate, and advanced level section. Each has a different dance routine. There's also a free style section, a warm up section, latin, reggae sections. The free video is really cool, you get to see an audition for a brandy video, which shows even more steps for a very advanced professional dance routine for Brandy's tour. You learn TONS!! of steps in each section. I can't say enough about how good this video is! You will definately not regret buying it. I bought the NY Ballet Workout video yesterday too (don't recommend that one, very choppy, and the narrator talks in a creepy monotone throughout, really weird, who produced that video?? There's no instructor in the ballet workout video, just dancers doing ballet positions and not explaining what's going on, you have to know ballet already to make sense of anything) Anyway, I just totally loved Laurie Ann Gibson's hip hop DVD. Hope there will be more videos soon like for reggaeton, latin, house etc.. Seriously, buy this Video if you want to learn to dance hip hop. You'll will find yourself smiling throughout, it's Ultra positive high energy and most importantly FUN!!",1118620800,20,1301,4.86036036036036
2268239,5,B00096S408,"I've seen Laurie Ann Gibson on making the band 3 and I thought her teaching style was effective. I haven't seen the DVD yet and I haven't been able to find even a single review of the DVD anywhere on the web. Without any independent information about the DVD, it's kind of a gamble. I ordered the DVD and after I use it I will post my own review so others can see if it's worth the money or not. I'm hoping it is at least as good as the work I've seen her do on tv. I'll let you all know when it comes in the mail! See ya then!",1118016000,,527,3.7567567567567566
2268240,5,B00096S408,"I love this DVD i have several learn to dance DVD's and this is by far the favourite. Laurie Ann does tend to flog the fact she has choreographed for brandy, and alica keys etc, but the chorography in this dvd really it fantastic, she has 3 levels of experience beginner to advanced. She breaks down all the dances so they are easy to learn. i did find howevre that she does move fast through them and i found i had to rewind a bit to learn it but other then that its a great dvd. Theres a freestyle section doesn't teach you anything in fact if your getting it just for that forget you'll be disappointed! But the routines are some so the most fun, easily learn and original i have done. LOVING IT!",1169856000,2,699,4.185185185185185
2268241,3,B00096S408,"I purchased this dvd for my daughter as she is into the art(s) of dancing.  I asked her to critique it, her reply was it was just ok.  I asked her for details to which she replied, she has great respect for Laurie Ann but was disappointed and expected more.  The dance/instructions were not as challenging as she expected. It's ok for someone very new to hip hop dancing.",1169769600,4,371,4.3478260869565215
2268242,4,B00096S408,Easy to learn when you have some sort of dancing experience. Great and unique techniques. Very smooth. Recommended to anyone who wants to dance  hip hop.,1163116800,2,153,4.884615384615385
2268243,1,B00096S408,"I should have known better than to think that Laurie Anna Gibson aka Ms. Conceited, would be able to pull off a good dance instruction dvd.  First of all, she dances her way through the dvd only going over the dance moves once- but reminds us that we can always replay the section.  I found it very tedious and annoying to replay a section just because she didn't take the time to go over it properly.  Another thing that bothered me was the fact that it was expected for you to learn the moves without her mirror image on the televison instead of including the angle of her back facing you.  This is confusing because you have to remind yourself that her right is your left and vice versa.  Anyhow, I thought that she would have at least used some familiar songs to dance with but they just used that generic ""hip hop"" soundtrack that didn't resemble real hip hop music at all.  She would have kept me interested if she had used songs and routines that she has choreographed in the past.",1160784000,14,988,4.371584699453552
2268244,2,B00096S408,"Wasn't impressed.  When I buy an exercise video or dance video I feel the purpose is to teach you.  The fact that she doesn't mirror the moves makes it difficult to learn.  Laurie does relie on the fact that you can rewind.  The warm up was horrible, a few head rolls and hip movements.  I didn't get past the begginers part for a while because it was confusing.",1143158400,15,362,4.264705882352941
2268245,1,B00096S408,"This video would have been much better if Laurie ann Gibson wasn't so full of herself.  I can't bear to use the dvd any more because other than the dancing all she does is talk about herself and how great she is or other people are talking about how great she is.

  All I care about is the dancing!!!!!",1140307200,13,303,4.084745762711864
2268246,3,B00096S408,bought this product to learn how to dance but the dances are so routine and there are not many different dance steps.,1140220800,10,117,4.363636363636363
2268247,5,B00096S408,"I found this Dvd Set to be very helpful , Laurie Ann broke down each section into levels , like Beginners , Intermediate and Advanced , so that you can begin on the level you feel most comfortable and i found this to be very helpful. Some of the moves may seem difficult when you first begin , but if you work your way up through the levels you'll be dancin' like a pro in no time . Thumbs up !",1138492800,9,394,3.876543209876543
2268248,2,B00096S408,"I definately would not recommend this item for beginners who wat to dance. The moves go pretty fast in this DVD and because everything is opposite looking at the tv, its even harder for a beginner. As far as someone whos looking for a good workout, I would not recommend this dvd for that either. There are far too many breaks and far too much talking.",1137110400,13,352,4.348484848484849
2268249,4,B00096S408,"The dvd is set on a industrial looking space with Laura getting help from dancers. It comes in 5.1 as well as regular stereo.
First she shoes a music video for a minute that only had a few moves of the ones you'd be learning.
She introduces the dvd for 3 min & then there's a very short warm-up (if you can call it that) for 3 min. of just head rolls, hip bumps, arm circles & side stretches.
The beginning moves is only 13 min. with 6 male & female backups. She shows you the moves with music real-time first, then goes slower time & breaks it down move by move w/o music. She doesn't give that many cues, but she uses good analogies. She will go through each move 1-3x depending on complexity. This is not meant to be an exercise video, just instruction with her knowing you can always rewind if you forget quickly. After 2-3 moves, she will ask you to try them together calling out the names of the move as you do them to music sometimes. Then she breaks down another 2-3 & then you put those together with the first 3. She only goes from the top at the end only one time with music.
The Intermediate is only 10 min. with 4 male & female dancers which again, she shows you how it looks first, then breaks it down like I said above.
The advanced moves she says if you can do it, you should be a dancer. This is also only 10 min with 2 guys as backup.
This makes a total of about 36 minutes of warm-up & dancing. After is 4 minutes superstars & freestyle where they show a couple examples of how to take some of the moves you learned & add it to your own dancing at a club.
The music was great, too bad she didn't have it playing softly in the background as she taught. I didn't have a problem with her voice or speaking style. I didn't find the moves that complex, I got a few easily the first time, but to get it down would take practice of course. She does cue your left & right, but I'm so used to mirroring anyhow. The only thing I could wish was more repitition (cheaper for them to tell you just to rewind) & a few more cues when breaking down each move.
There's another menu choice called ""club remix"" after the ""class selection"" where they show how to move to House music for 4 min, Reggae with teaching 3 moves for 6 min & Salsa for 3 min in a club. Mostly it's very talented dancers showing off & giving you ideas if can do it just by watching.

There's a trailer at collagevideo com",1135728000,55,2395,4.084925690021231
8057645,3,B00096S408,"My first impression was that she's good and the steps seem pretty easy.  My only issue is that I'm a white girl and my hips don't move like that- would have liked her to break things down a little more so I could follow them better.  She just says move your hips, does it and then moves on to the next thing. No breakdown of How to move -
But I'm going to keep going because she does have some great moves in there and I'll just have to keep watching the video over and over and over again till I get the hip movement right!",1356652800,,524,3.9339622641509435
8057646,5,B00096S408,When I got it and just sat there and looked at it without interacting I thought ten bucks was too much. But after I got my butt up off the couch and started dancing I realized for a beginner like me it was really intense I am now strting to get the dance moves down and everytime I accomplish them I feel very proud. I am so glad that I got the dvd but that doesnt go without sayin that this is the only dvd you will need to be able to dance well and get into shape for me as a recording artist tring to step my game up I have purchased several other dvd's to get a well rounded dance experience. But I can definitly say that this dvd has ben a great frist addition. Thanks Loriann,1294617600,,681,3.906474820143885
8057647,1,B00096S408,"Don't bother to purchase this DVD if you are a beginner. Laurie Ann goes way too fast and doesn't go over the routines enough for you to catch on. I recommend Madonna Grimes, you'll get what your looking for!",1264723200,,208,4.358974358974359
8057648,3,B00096S408,"Like some reviewers had stated, if you are a rookie to hip hop, you'd get lost, if you are an advanced dancer, the moves are not challenging or refreshing.

It's not a dance class set-up, which I'd prefer.  If you take a dance class, the teacher will demonstrate a few moves at a time and say ""let's go from the top"" a few times.  By the time the last step is taught, you'd be dancing the routine a few dozen times.  That's how dancers learn routines, by going over and over.

Sadly, this is not the style of Laurie's DVD.  She'd teach the steps and maybe go over the accumulative steps once or twice before the end when the complete routine is done only once.

Of all three, the advanced routine is the best and most hip-hoppy.  The beginner one is a joke.  The intermediate has mostly sports oriented moves (like the movie Honey) and not challenging or dancey enough.

If you are relatively good at hip hop and picking up moves, I'd recommend Hip Hop Funk master Jermaine Browne's Broadway Dance Center class.  His three routines will let you shine big time at clubs and company holiday dance parties.",1248048000,,1103,4.465
8057649,2,B00096S408,"I would not recommend this product. She doesn't break down the dances using counts, and she moves too fast. You have to keep stopping the dvd and going back to learn the dance. I was really disappointed with this dvd.",1239062400,,217,4.45
8057650,4,B00096S408,"Imma a mother of 3 kids who think they are pretty hip, they love to dance, I mean love it, I too have a pretty extensive background in hiphop dance, We have been doing this since christmas and perfecting it. We plan to perform it for the talent show at the next big family gathering. The fact that we can back it up and do it over and over and over until we get it is a bonus.  But if you dance and are pretty good and keeping up and can remember the steps it won't take as long as it is taking my 8 year old to get it. We Love it. It's Hip, It's funky, It is Jammin. Get it, its worth it.",1232150400,,589,3.712
8057651,5,B00096S408,"WELL GOT THIS FOR FUN , AND SOME OF THE DANCE MOVES ARE SO RETARDED LIKE PRETENDING UR HITTING A BASEBALL AND THERE'S A BASKETBALL ONE, HONESTLY DOES ANYONE DANCE LIKE THAT?",1225929600,2,173,4.4375
8057652,3,B00096S408,"There was quite a bit to be desired in this DVD (a proper warm-up, more repetition for dance steps, less name dropping) but I did like a few things (the style of the steps, the flow of the final set, high energy) so I gave it three stars.  I just dance for fun in the morning so there may be more technical reasons for the whys and why-nots of this DVD...this is just an inexperienced persons view.",1188345600,,398,4.1688311688311686
8057653,3,B00096S408,"If your a newbie to dance, I think she goes to fast. If your advanced, the moves aren't all that.",1182211200,,97,3.9
8057654,4,B00096S408,"This hip hop dvd is a great start for anyone wanting to learn and practice at home. It is not a substitute to taking a live dance class with a teacher and students, though. Laurie Ann Gibson is a little over the top when you first watch it but then you start to realize that her energy is really good to keep you going. The moves are progressively challenging and the instruction is pretty good. I bought my own copy after renting it from the library. I really liked it enough to buy one. It is not worth full price but best to buy it from a reseller. Good luck, this hip hop dvd is fun and challenging. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn hip hop.",1181001600,2,660,4.124031007751938
