And this story of liberating Iraq and further enduring a freedom by British troopers is exactly what it is.

A daily routine of survival in a hostile to liberators land is peppered with explicit tortures, sexism and macho dominance towards locals and co-soldiers. If even a group-interrogation scene looks a bit concentrated, similarly to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salo/dp/B0019X3ZZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salo</a>&nbsp;actions, revelations of moral and general behavioral patterns might hardly question the UK movie-makers' personal acquaintance with native homeland environment presented by British cinematography more and more frequently and, perhaps, surprisingly honestly to an outer world.

A suicide in a tube committed by a character played by G. Kearns is really an emphatic moment after actor's body was screened in all his young man beauty.

Good performance, good intentions, good actors.",1298764800,,1219,7.272108843537415
3542458,3,B001DXD58C,"Unfortunate that the audio is AWFUL and NO SUBTITLES. I understood very little of what was said, so I just watched the story as if I were mostly deaf. Typical English-speaking Americans will not decipher the words as spoken and anybody else, well, not unless you're from a certain neighborhood in England, good luck! For the story: it's portrayed ""without political bias"". Sadly though, it might come across as a historical account and basically a smear on the American & British efforts in Iraq. The story of this war effort is easily misconstrued. Today I will attend a service for a young soldier who gave his life in service to America and freedom-loving people. He is a good young man at peace with God today. He gave his life to save the lives of ""innocent"" Afghan civilians, because what is more important to many in America today is preserving enemy civilian shields instead of preserving American soldiers and their families. As with Japan in '45 we should be using massive bombing to achieve our ends over there but we're not. It's a hard debacle. Mark of Cain could have been better and seems like a first or second effort at film-making. There truly was an effort at non-partisanship and lack of bias.
Where are the movies about the countless atrocities committed by Muslims against countless victims: innocent women and children, Christians, their own people in the name of Islam and the Koran? It's not a religion of peace after all.
However, I highly recommend ""Combat Diary: The Marines of Lima Co.""",1288396800,2,1515,4.8084291187739465
3542459,2,B001DXD58C,"Wanted to like it,get thru it, but couldn't. I prefer most British films with subtitles cause my hearing isn't the best and here with all the noise of combat on top of the accents I found it impossible to understand what was being said. My rule is--if I can't understand it I let it go and watch something else which is a shame cause the Iraq War from a Great Britian perspective is why I bought this DVD. If your hearing is top notch--great, get this and enjoy. If it isn't like mine, don't purchase this DVD.",1283558400,4,510,4.268041237113402
3542460,5,B001DXD58C,"This is an excellent fiction film about torture in Iraq. Shane Gulliver and Mark Tate are stationed in Basra.  When their company's captain is killed during a mission, they capture two alleged suspects and are told to use whatever means necessary to extract information (i.e. torture).  This film captures the difficult task of maintaining a personal code of ethics inside a powerful organization like the military.  With the success of docs like 'Taxi to the Dark Side' and 'Standard Operating Procedure', hopefully this film will continue to spotlight the military's blatant disregard for the standards of the Geneva Convention.  The cinematography is haunting and the acting noteworthy, definitely deserving of the BAFTA award it won this year.",1219363200,4,747,5.358974358974359
3542491,3,B001DXD58C,"I watched this only because one of my favorite actors, Brendan Coyle, was in it, but all too briefly. It was brutal and difficult to watch but knowing it was based on things that actually happenes within the military of all countries was disturbing but on the other hand, we should not think all military personnel are heroes. That such brutality was sanctioned by the higher echelon was most disturbing especially when these ""officers"" blamed everything on their subordinates. Not a movie for the squeamish.",1395705600,3,508,4.988235294117647
3542492,1,B001DXD58C,"I served in Iraq as a US Marine, and had the privilege of serving with UK Royal Marine and Engineers.

This movie is likely one of the worst renderings of that conflict I have had the displeasure of seeing. The early scenes in Iraq on patrol with boredom and chaos are accurately done.

But then the  quickly becomes filled with judgement, stereotyping of soldiers by those who likely don't know any personally, and agenda of the liberal anti-war bent.

The underlying narrative the producers seek to enlighten us with their agenda, all easily summarized as:

1) most soldiers are not too smart and most are tricked into war by cynical older men;
2) most soldiers are just young cannon fodder who do no good;
3) many if not most soldiers are brutal, sadistic and inhumane;
4) war bends all people into animals and no war is ever worth fighting; and
5) the title Mark of Cain is meant to imply soldiers are like Cain, the very first murder, all soldiers are murderers.

There is little idealism or anything noble in the producer's world view and this storyline.

I highly recommend you take a pass watching this movie unless you wish to be dispirited for no good reason.  The film is inaccurate and does a great disservice to all soldiers and Marines of all generations of every nation.",1386028800,35,1285,4.629955947136564

An excellent movie for many reasons, and you'll find multiple important themes.

For me, this movie goes far beyond the current issues existing in the wars in Afghanistan and what I imagine happened in Iraq. From what I have read, this is common in all wars.

The immense pressure to ""go along"" with others or suffer the consequences. But in this movie, the tale continues after the soldiers return home.

Here, you will see how those who are lowest in status within their micro-society, the regiment, are sacrificed for the ""good of the regiment."" When in reality, it's the usual theme of people in various positions of power just covering their crimes and protecting their careers.

For those who still believe in doing what is right, they are confronted with the power behind those who have essentially sold their souls.

I highly recommend The Mark of Cain.",1329004800,4,1011,5.532467532467533

3542499,5,B001DXD58C,"Provoking. Two young British men-Mark and Shane- join the Iraq war. They grow familiar with the constant stress; they face, for the first time, the breaking points of mental and physical exhaustion. Nothing is safe here--every littered Coke can could be a cleverly disguised bomb. When their company captain is killed, a superior officer cracks, and orders the boys to begin torturing the locals.  It is only until Mark and Shane have arrived safely back on UK shores that they are forced to confront the consequences of their actions.

Thoughtful, relevant to contemporary times, beautifully filmed on a modest budget. It's little surprise the film won a BAFTA and the ""Movies That Matter"" Award at the Rotterdam International Film Festival.",1310601600,2,742,5.175

Producer should have placed subtitles on the screen so as to translate British to American so we could understand what heck they were saying.

8295301,5,B001DXD58C,"Not sure if it tells the story without too much exageration. Prepare to close your eyes all the time to avoid too strong visual impact. Sound alone is enough to get the message. Not remember seeing a helicopter as in the DVD cover picture, may be I closed the eyes too often. Very, very strong impact. Believe it will be considered as an important documentation. Facing the dirty part of glory certainly earns respect. To avoid future repeatness of this kind, caputred should be put under civilian controlled unit. Establish Battlion Level, if not Company level, Civilian controlled ""Civilization Aids"" unit or personnel, should be implemented ASAP. Especially where street warfare is possible. No body needs to live in the rest of life with that strong guilty feeling. Damage to the emotional ones is totally unnecessary. War is unavoidable.

8295302,5,B001DXD58C,"The Mark of Cain = lots of food for thought. I agree with many other reviewers that it is totally brutal. Tread carefully, because some scenes are  graphic and violent, and the rest are very emotionally loaded. Specifically, there's bullying, mental health problems, torture, and suicide, which are hard enough to process individually, but in this case they're all portrayed in a two hour block. It's not a movie for the physically or emotionally squeamish.

The complicated moral center of the movie (which pretty explicitly states that Mark and Shane's only two options are loyalty or morality) is, I think, what has some people very fired up, but I would argue it's a fair portrait of the reality of war. Also, many of the events that come back to haunt Mark and Shane transpire extremely quickly, in a matter of minutes or seconds, as do the major decisions that the characters make. I really appreciated the balance between head-spinning action and the monotony of soldiers sitting around camp for hours on end, because it felt very true to life.

Someone noted below that the dialogue is hard to understand; this is somewhat true, given that almost everyone in the film speaks with a very particular North English accent (practically Scouse, like the Beatles). Personally I didn't have much trouble with it- however, if you're not used to listening to people speak in this accent, it's still fairly easy to pick up on the mood of the action.

The character development is striking and very well done. I actually grew attached to Mark and Shane's characters super quickly and I doubt I was the only one; what's more, their personalities in contrast to their actions is really what makes the rest of the movie so horrifying. All in all, it was a very enjoyable movie, though I need some time before I'll be able to watch it again...",1421798400,,1836,4.782334384858044
