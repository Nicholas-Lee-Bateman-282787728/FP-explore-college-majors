378422,5,6301930010,This was a rare find for me and came earlier than expected.  It was just as described and I am very happy with my purchase.,1358380800,,123,3.92
378423,1,6301930010,"I didn't realize I was ordering a VHS!  My fault, it's a funny movie, from what we remember, but we no longer have a VHS, only a DVD, Netflix, DVR...etc..",1356998400,,154,4.133333333333334
378424,5,6301930010,I absolutely love this film.  Some silly Pot humor as you would expect with Cheech Marin but a great plot and great performances.  Julie Haggerty gives a hilarious performance as she is telling the main characters about the world while trying to open a container of Frujen Glaja (sp?).  She should have won an academy award for that scene alone.  My only regret is that it is not readily available on DVD.  You won't be disappointed if you can get past the few silly pot scenarios.,1356048000,,481,4.546511627906977
378425,5,6301930010,"This is a flick from the past about the past. Had to add it to my collection. Thanks Amazon, only came in vhs but thats ok - it kind of fits that way.,..",1343174400,,153,3.6666666666666665
378426,5,6301930010,I watched this movie immediately after recieving it. This vhs movie was in great shape and had arrived very speedily. Thanks,1325635200,2,124,4.9523809523809526
378427,5,6301930010,It presents good questions that should be asked and even though drug references are there it has a good moral of peace and love. Im sure everyone could use some of that sometime. I just wish they had it in the DVD format!!,1224633600,6,222,4.186046511627907
378428,5,6301930010,"This is a great movie. I first saw it back in the late 80's. It is hilarious with a bunch of funny lines that I still use today.  Its also very relevant in its political, social and enviormental views. Overall just a great movie that made me laugh and cry.",1220918400,3,256,4.12
378429,5,6301930010,"I loved this movie from the first time it was viewed. I was a teenager, and it contributed to alot of the ideas that have become a part of who I am today. Eric Roberts is steamy hot, but the plot is very important too! A must see for everyone!",1137196800,6,243,3.88
378430,5,6301930010,"A lot of people don't appreciate the message this movie brings, even if they appreciate it's humor. ""Rude Awakening"" came out when I was a toddler, and it has meant a lot to me watching it throughout my life. The speech ""Fred Wook"" (Eric Roberts) gives in the movie about our environment is very moving.

Aside from it's wonderful message, this is an extremely entertaining movie! Cheech is funny as ever, and Eric Roberts is a hunk! Plus a slew of other comedians and a wonderful soundtrack accompany this movie.

I highly reccomend it to anyone interested in our environment, 60s or 80s culture, or just a really good comedy. :)",1095292800,9,630,4.666666666666667
378431,5,6301930010,"COntrary to the critics appraisal, its a pretty darn funny movie the first time yuou see it. It basically fits into the stupid funny genre, great watch while smoking (*chuckles*). I highly recommend it,, especially if you  smoke.",963705600,8,229,5.026315789473684
7816809,5,6301930010,"This is a great film. It is extremely difficult to find outside of VHS format. Unfortunately the copy I purchased does not function in my region, therefore my recollections of the movie are only fond memories.",1472601600,,209,4.833333333333333
7816810,5,6301930010,I bought this for my dad because he had a hard time finding this movie. I wish they had this movie on DVD but my dad said VHS would do because he still has one. I remember watching this movie growing up and thought it was a good comedy.,1462406400,,236,3.836734693877551
7816811,3,6301930010,Why is this not available on dvd? I bought the vhs but am not able watch it,1452297600,3,75,3.4705882352941178
7816812,5,6301930010,"Oh I love Up In Smoke, Still Smoking and From Dusk till Dawn but this was my first Cheech Marin movie and remains my favorite.  Funny and thoughtful..  It also lead to me being quite the Eric Roberts fan.  I just wish it would come out on dvd because I sure hate hooking up my old vcr every time I want to watch it.",1451692800,,315,3.890625
7816813,5,6301930010,"I watched this movie back in the early 90's, just about every night!! If you get past all the smoking involved, it has a great plot about our earth, people, and the goverment.",1440201600,,175,4.333333333333333
7816814,5,6301930010,"Great, funny film. Tape is in perfect shape.",1434672000,,44,4.625
7816815,5,6301930010,"I was hoping to change this wonderful piece of memorabilia to DVD but copywrite laws wouldn't allow it. I found a DVDcopy someplace else. It is my all time favorite old movie. The script was made for Eric Roberts! He is so beautiful in it, when he cries in the end I cry. I know it got bad reviews but I do not care. I loved this movie beginning to end.",1433289600,2,353,3.9859154929577465
7816816,4,6301930010,Loved the movie growing up,1427587200,,26,4.4
7816817,5,6301930010,Excellent movie!!  Very funny and socially relevent. Great performances by all the cast. Really sad that it has not yet been released on dvd!,1403481600,,141,4.875
7816818,5,6301930010,"I was so disappointed to find that Netflix didn't have this title available, and then I learned that it was never transferred to DVD. It's a shame, because I would have expected it to have genuine cult movie status for us 60's people who never turned into yuppies. It's just a great, nostalgic, funny old film. Thank goodness I didn't give my old VHS player to Goodwill. The play quality of this particular used version is great.",1400457600,,429,4.584415584415584
