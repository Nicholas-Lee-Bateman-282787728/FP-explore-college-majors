8483669,5,B005QROR74,"This was a great little movie. It was funny, and the mystery plot was sufficient to keep you guessing until the end. While not overdone, the Western aspect was a nice change from NYC, which is where it seems most of the action in the U.S. took place during the 1930s-40s. I would have given this 4 starts, but I wanted to balance out the nimrod who gave the film 1 star due to the film's quality. Word to the wise people, films made back when were not always stored in the best of conditions. Copies were lost or destroyed. Sometimes all that exists is a 16mm print of the film. These movies are copied from the best source material available. While the film could be digitally remastered I suppose, the low price reflects that it hasn't been. And even if it had been remastered, the poor quality of the original couldn't be completely covered up. The defects, static, etc. are part of the charm of watching old movies. If you want to watch glitzy and glossy movies, go to your local theater.",1457740800,2,992,4.426229508196721
8483670,1,B005QROR74,"I like Chester Morris and this is a good ""B"" movie of his.
I give it one star because the picture quality of this one made by, Sinister Cinema, is so poor in picture quality.
It is home made. The Alpha Video is not real good, but is far better than this copy.",1379635200,2,259,3.9056603773584904
