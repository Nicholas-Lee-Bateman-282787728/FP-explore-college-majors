8153182,4,B000JUK2O0,"This DVD introduces a new series by the diving legends John Chatterton and Richie Kohler.  Both are well known in the diving world so any series they produce is exciting and full of information.  This DVD is not the best quality and shows signs of being rushed into production....BUT it is still worth buying for any scuba divers.  The information is good and entertaining, the underwater footage is excellent, and getting to know these famous icons of scuba diving is a joy.",1201564800,,475,4.7682926829268295
