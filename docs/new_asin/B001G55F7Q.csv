8303924,5,B001G55F7Q,"Gus G has put together a phenomenal band here , appollo is a great singer! Bob is awesome! Petros is awesome!  Drums are killer! It's a shame appollo decdied to step down as singer, he was the last piece of the Firewind puzzle that cit perfectly! I got a chance to see this lineup in Cleveland , ohio.  minus their drummer,  it was amazing! Gus is a phenom himself, I heard no mistakes from this band , it was just really awesome! So I picked up the live premonition to check out and wow! They deliver! Can't wait for their new love DVD to come out!",1369958400,,549,4.160377358490566
8303925,5,B001G55F7Q,Excellent band with lot's of energy!! Gus G. their lead guitarist Rocks and is the closest thing to Randy Rhoades that i've seen or heard. Only thing that could make this DVD better is A good 5.1 True HD Master Audio sound and Blue-ray High Def. Picture. It's done in Dolby stereo! Meant to be cranked up and kick back!! Two thumbs up for the money!!,1299628800,2,350,4.318181818181818
