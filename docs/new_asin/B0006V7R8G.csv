2196495,5,B0006V7R8G,"This KJV of the old & New Testament is such a pleasure to watch and listen to. Being able to see the actual pages of the Scripture as they are being read, makes it so easy to read the Bible through; especially for those who are not proficient readers.",1320278400,3,251,4.142857142857143
2196496,5,B0006V7R8G,"It's nice to let the word of God saturate our spirit.  I have loved allowing His holy word just pour into me and so have my children.

Listening to the word of God also helps us to capture the ""true"" heart of God & help put spiritual things into perspective.  There is no more excuse for us to say we cannot understand the word of God for now all we have to do is listen & pay attention as it unfolds consecutively before us.

I have often heard people offering an uneducated guess about God's word & what is true and what is not true about God, but clearly, we cannot embark upon a theological discussion until we consume God's word & allow God's to word consume us.

""With all thy getting, get an understanding"", only then can we share the truth of the gospel with everyone.

Enjoy",1316131200,4,783,4.256756756756757
2196497,3,B0006V7R8G,"I was really excited about getting my DVD for just under $12.00 w/s&h only $3.99. But when I listen to it, the speaker reads too fast! I'm disappointed, because sometimes I don't even have time to pause it and underline or highlight something that is important to me. I enjoyed the NLT that I got for abut the same price from Walmart. The reading there was very regular and I could pause it and underline and highlight, etc. In Christ, Nellie Austin",1293321600,,449,4.487804878048781
2196498,5,B0006V7R8G,"It is difficult for some to read the KJV, this DVD makes reading with this verson easy. If you want to listen or read along or do both, this DVD makes it easy to do so. There were details I missed when reading on my on that I caught as Stephen Johnson read to me. He has a great voice and I also like the special effects. This is a great item to add to your library and to give as a gift to new or old christians and those who are sick, elderly, don't read well, professional, any one. All will  benefit from this selection.",1292630400,12,524,3.943396226415094
2196499,5,B0006V7R8G,"I have been saved for over 20 years and I have never found a resource more valuable to my growth in Christ than this Bible on DVD. There is a move towards decadence - moral and social decay - in our society like none ever before. Jesus is comin soon. We need the Word of God. I used to have a struggle reading the King James Version. Now I don't use anything other (although sometimes the New King James Version, as a comparison, or if I am having some difficulty with the old english).

This is a must own for anyone who is needing to read or hear the Word of God more but is not for what ever reason.  The announcer is perfect, the menu - excellent (you can pause if you want to reflect on any scripture) and you can pick whatever book and chapter you want to focus on at any time. The music accentuates the reading, and you can follow along with the reading on your tv screen if you want.

You can pop it into the dvd player it if you are trouble sleeping, if you are working around the house, or if you want to study with your Bible.  I cannot say enough about this great product. Everyone should have one. A great Christmas gift, Easter gift, birthday gift, etc. Don't be deceived - the devil does not want believers to have this resource in their libraries.",1192320000,35,1263,4.185185185185185

2196537,5,B0006V7R8G,"All those Reviews ! What a Challenge !! Can it be handled ? What A luxury being read the Bible ! King James too ! Even if the mind wanders ! Still a great influence ! No time for spin as the next verse is being read ! Fast enough for big picture and still keep up ! Five, ten or more chapters until enough ! Wasting nothing on anything but listening ! So Awesome that all other entertainment just seems to fade away !! You still see it ! Not the same anymore ! Reading along can be fun too ! On the DVD player ? Great on the Apple computer ! Very consuming ! Mirror to the Soul ? Not a light read ! All Consuming ? God Knows !!!! LOVE IT !! Ordered another one ! Great Gift for the holidays ! All this in one single DVD too ! Best buy ever !

2196538,5,B0006V7R8G,"I have been through the Bible several times before and this is the first time I try an audio version. It's like a whole new experience to go through it once more in this new format. You hear the narrator while the text is displayed on the screen. There are several voices to 'play' the different persons in the chapters, which helps with the understanding.

8043585,4,B0006V7R8G,"I rededicated my life to Christ about 2 months ago and wanted to get CDs on Christian sermons and movies. There is a lack of bible scripture study and sermons on the limited Christian radio stations K-LOVE) in my area. This Christian station plays contemporary Christian rock/rap music which I am not into. So I tuned out of those and decided to look elsewhere.

I searched on Amazon and found this complete Holy Bible-King James Version on 1 CD. It contains all 66 books in the bible (old/new) testament.
It is nicely formatted and easy to use. You can begin anywhere that you wish. It work well on my home laptop. I don't think it is formatted for a DVD player in ones car, as I haven't tried it yet.

The reader goes through the scripture rather quickly. So if you wish to reflect on a particular passage or verse, it is easy to navigate back to that location to replay it. The audio is excellent so I download it on my laptop and listen while I do my chores around the home. Different voices speak the verses/passages for the different characters in the stories (i.e. Garden of Eden- God, Adam, Eve, and Serpent/Devil) present in the bible passage adding realism to the reading.

Overall it is a good starting point for those that want to get into God's Word. However, it is best to cut out at least an hour each day and read His Word, study, meditate on it to get a better understanding. Listening to His Word on this CD helps reinforce it.",1472515200,3,1445,4.424812030075188
