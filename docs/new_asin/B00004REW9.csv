7920852,5,B00004REW9,"It's certainly not the most technically skillful film you'll ever see -- how can it be, when the East Berlin segments were done surreptitiously, with a Super-8 camera, sans sound?  The musical soundtrack is annoying, and the plot can get confusing at points, especially around ancillary characters (the L.A. intro could easily be dispensed with, and so could the seemingly obligatory drag queen musical number).  But ... Westler provides a fascinating look at gay life behind the Iron Curtain in the 1980s.  The fall of the Wall is imminent, but these characters don't know that, and the choices they make for love (it's a wildly romantic movie, in the best old-fashioned sense) are risky indeed.  And the performance of Rainer Strecker as the lovestruck Easterner Tommy lifts the entire proceedings.  Just watch the first time Felix comes to visit Tommy's flat; the scene perfectly captures the tentative, nervous atmosphere when two people are attracted to each other but each doesn't know if the other feels the same way -- you can't get more universal than that.  Great details of Cold War life in the West vs. the East, too -- notice the details of the two apartments and their buildings.  If you can put aside the notion that low production values = a poor-quality film, you'll find it well worthwhile.",1273622400,,1308,4.918181818181818
7920853,4,B00004REW9,"""Westler"" is a gay movie from the mid-1980s, situated in the divided city of Berlin. The plot is reasonably simple: a West German boy is visited by his American friend, who wants to see East Berlin. So, on they go, only to encounter an East German beauty on the other side. The West German and the East German fall in love, but the Wall makes their relationship increasingly impossible. In the end, they devise a risky escape plan, by flying to Prague and trying to get the East German out via Yugoslavia. The film ends open-ended on whether this succeeds or not.

The most interesting aspect of the movie is not so much the plot though, or the acting for that matter (which is ok), but the camera work. A lot of the scenes filmed in East Berlin and in Prague were filmed illegally with a small handheld camera, and this creates a very interesting perspective on those places, both absolutely and regarding their role in the movie. Also, the 1980s atmosphere prevalent throughout the entire movie has a certain nostalgic quality to it now (not the intent of the movie, of course), which reminds one of ""Goodbye Lenin"" and the like.

Probably worth seeing for fans of arthouse movies.",1190246400,4,1183,4.628571428571429
