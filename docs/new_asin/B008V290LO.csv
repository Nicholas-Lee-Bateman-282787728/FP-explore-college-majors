8530767,1,B008V290LO,"A surreal trainwreck from the early 1970s that immerses you in an onslaught of lycanthropy, insanity, unfathomable motivation, dreadful acting, inexplicable dialogue, and both implied and very real onscreen animal cruelty.  Think of a badly-edited amalgamation of ""Dark Shadows"" and ""Willard"" (but without the redeeming social value), and you begin to get a sense of how far off the rails this film really goes.  Like a trainwreck, it's sort of difficult to look away.  But do yourself a favor and look away.",1520899200,,508,5.170731707317073
8530768,1,B008V290LO,"The utterly insane Mooney family has many problems, the least of which is lycanthropy. Their biggest problem stems from just how bloody annoying they all are! When Diana (Jackie Skarvellis) brings her new husband, Gerald, home for a visit, the family really turns out! Sister Monica shows her true eeevil. Feral brother Malcolm lives in his chicken-filled room, raving like a rabid squirrel, even when he's not being set on fire. Meanwhile, Pa Mooney grumbles on in his pompous way, in between his neck injections. Luckily, Gerald is accustomed to horrible families, having quite a sordid history of his own. Soon enough, everyone is yelling at each other in histrionic hysteria. Monica beats Malcolm. Malcolm caterwauls like an agonized hyena. Chickens are mercilessly murdered in the family dungeon. A mouse is stabbed w/ a butcher knife, and nailed to a table (yep, the graphic animal torture is all too real! if you are disturbed by such sadistic, idiot behavior, then, by all means, avoid this stink-burger!). Gerald wears a silly robe. THE RATS ARE COMING! THE WEREWOLVES ARE HERE! is a true endurance test, recommended for only the stoutest schlock enthusiasts. Even they will need protective eye-wear! Normal viewers will feel as though their souls have separated from their bodies! In this semi-nirvanic state, they could experience what the scholars refer to as ""sweet oblivion"". Indeed, this ""film"" can cause living death! What distinguishes TRAC! TWAH! from other, lesser cesspool filler, is its extreme, brain-pulverizing aura of ultimate stultification. The absurd ""dialogue"" drones on and on, leading nowhere, while the abysmal ""acting"" hammers at the mind like a slaughterhouse bolt-gun! You might make it to the deliriously inept, shape-shifting, non-finale, but you'll certainly wonder why you bothered! BEWARE: WATCHING THIS MOVIE COULD LEAD TO THE SUDDEN URGE TO LEAP UNDER A PASSING BUS! God help us all...",1447200000,5,1927,5.280130293159609
8530769,3,B008V290LO,"I bought this movie to replace my old VHS copy. It is not the greatest movie, it is not the worst movie in my collection. But it is very watchable for a low budget movie. I like British horror movies being a Hammer Films fan way back when. And even though this is not a Hammer Film, it still has the British feel to it.",1369008000,2,319,3.923076923076923
