5104774,5,B007Q0K9ZI,"Under the Stars.
  Love it.  Andre can do no wrong in the music world.  I purchase every new Rieu CD I come across..",1354320000,6,116,3.9130434782608696
5104775,5,B007Q0K9ZI,"Love this DVD.
Andre Rieu is fun to watch and the music is well performed. Great showmanship is seen in this presentation from an impressive ensemble of talented musicians and singers. The sights and sounds from a people not that distant from us.
In viewing, I am noticing the voyeur aspects. It is fun to see the audience enjoying the performances. Their faces are a treasure.
I read someone say there are too many audience shots. For me, that's part of the gold found here.
Enjoy
PS... on my display the video on this DVD is clear and crisp. No discrepancies were seen.",1354060800,32,571,4.553398058252427
5104776,2,B007Q0K9ZI,"We were very disappointed with this DVD. The pictures were not clear, showed the audience too much, some of the musical numbers were dubbed in from previous shows and the selections were not his ""best"". We gave this dvd away after one viewing. Do not recommend this one to anyone. It does not do Andre justice.",1353456000,2,310,4.553571428571429
5104777,5,B007Q0K9ZI,"I love Andre Rieu, and he never ceases to make a DVD enjoyable, this one is no exception! My husband and I watch it again and again. Would recommend it to everyone !!!",1351382400,,167,4.090909090909091
5104778,5,B007Q0K9ZI,"A ""must"" for Andre Rieu fans!  Recorded and filmed  ""live"", in the Maestro's hometown in the Netherlands. A beautiful concert, and almost as good as being there, but of course, not quite!
However, this is a very close ""second"" place.",1347321600,12,233,4.8
5104779,3,B007Q0K9ZI,"I am a huge Andre Rieu. I've attended his concerts in the US and own every VHS tape and DVD he's ever made for the US and around the world, but this DVD was a disappointment. The medium and close up shots were, as usual, excellent, but the wide shots look like they were shot in SD. They look horrible on a big screen. Also, NO EXTRA FEATURES. When you pay top dollar for a Andre Rieu DVD, you expect some bonus material. Not this time.

The editing was second rate. Many times, the cutaway shots didn't match the action on the stage.

The DVD just looked thrown together. Not a pro job at all.

I'll be very careful about buying the next DVD.",1345420800,4,643,4.169354838709677

5104792,5,B007Q0K9ZI,"I love Andre. His music takes me back to my childhood of my dad holding me up and dancing around in the living room. Hearing the same music at my grandmothers house. My grandparents are from The Netherlands. First time I watched this, I had tears in my eyes. The ladies in his orchestra are beautiful. Yes, I do have my favorites to look at...lol. The soloist (both men and women) will sends chills up and down your spine. They are that good. I agree with one review that I wish they didn't pan so much of the crowd. I also wish that ""Oh Happy Day"" wasn't so long. There is also a special guest in the crowd who wrote a waltz that Andre did live for him. Not going to say who it is. Don't want to ruin it, but once you find out, you will say ""oh yea. I should had figured that out."" And it does sound like something that person would had done. I highly recommend this DVD.",1481673600,3,872,4.075581395348837

There are some good surprises in the concert that everyone can enjoy.

Be sure to have a good sound system when you play this so that you can enjoy the music fully.

5104841,1,B007Q0K9ZI,"If you like loud, 12 to 15 minutes of sickening, ear-assailing screeching passed off as music, this DVD is for you. If, like me, you're expecting the Johan Strauss Orchestra's take on timeless gems from Broadway, the Big Screen and the Masters -- save your money. I listened to the rest of the album, then tossed it in the trash can where it belongs!

Even if this ridiculous screech-fest had been performed by the greatest classical singers, living or dead, it would have been just as disgusting and assaulting to one's ears and senses.

I made up my mind that I will no longer purchase ANY Andre Rieu DVD unless seeing it first on public television to make sure I am not going to end up with another piece of offensive garbage!",1408752000,,729,4.515151515151516

5104846,5,B007Q0K9ZI,"To say that Andre' Rieu loves his home town of Maastricht is an understatement !!!!! ANY DVD that is done here will be the best of the best from all the concerts he has done all over the world. While Rieu and his Johann Strauss Orchestra & Choir bring their heart and soul and humor to every performance they do, everywhere in the world, it seems they are able to ratchet up the entertainment level for ANY concert done in Maastricht because people come from all over the planet to be a part of these. If you ever wanted an honest introduction to the person/people who make this phenomenon happen, just purchase any/all of the concerts done in Maastricht and you will transcend to a whole new level of entertainment.
