It appears to be a library copy, and knowing students, it probably didn't get checked out a lot. There is no wear and tear in any of the videotapes.  The program series is also among the best ever.  If you like Joseph Campbell, you will really enjoy this series.  I highly recommend it.  My rating is only a 4 because it is VHS.",1344211200,,432,4.219512195121951

Rating: NR. Religion.
Content: Psyche and Symbol starts the adventure from within ourselves---in our psyche and souls.
Campbell explains, in psychological terms, the universal themes that operate in all people and cultures which link us together.
He explains further how myths emerge from the unconscious and how, in every culture, these myths have evolved to guide the individual through the cycle of life.

(2) Mythos - The Spirit Land
Date: 1997, Time: 54 min. Color, Rating: NR. Religion
Content: The American Indian stands as an example of a people living, vital mythology, in harmony with the natural world.
In the Spirit Land, Campbell explores how, for the American Indian, myths served to awaken in them a mystery of life, and provide them with the rituals to prepare them for the obstacles of the real world.

(3) Mythos - On Being Human
Date: 1997, Time: 54 min. Color, Rating: NR. Religion
Content: On Being Human, Campbell discusses the characteristics we share in common with the animal world, and that point where animal behavior ends and human behavior begins.
Starting with paintings from the caves of Lascaux in France, he then traces myth's emergence and the central importance of the goddess in early hunter-gatherer societies.

(4) Mythos - From Goddesses To God
Date: 1997, Time: 54 min. Color, Rating: NR. Religion
Content: As bands of hunter-gatherers settled, societies become more institutionalized. Mythos of the goddess---connected to the earth---were supplanted by male deities who were often war-like. Campbell explores the connection between ancient societies and the origins of the Western Judeo-Christian tradition.

(5) Mythos - The Mystical Life
Date: 1997, Time: 54 min. Color, Rating: NR, Religion.
Content: The Mystical Life looks beyond the Judaic tradition, at other forces shaping the Western Spirit. Using texts and artifacts from the ancient mystery religions of Greece, Campbell reveals the unbroken connection between these religions and those of the west.

(6) Mythos - The Inward Path 2.1
Date: 1997, Time: 57 min., Color, Rating: NR, Religion.
Content: Joseph Campbell introduces us to the core ideas at the heart of the Eastern traditions and explores what Aldous Huxley called the Perennial Philosophy and how it is realized in Hinduism and Buddhism. He traces the development of the idea of spiritual emancipation from the early Indus Valley civilizations through the Vedic literature to the Upanishads. Campbell identifies the point of departure between the Eastern and Western traditions. He also explains the concept of Nirvana and sets the stage for Buddha.

(7) Mythos - The Enlightened One 2.2
Date: 1997, Time: 57 min., Color, Rating: NR, Religion.
Content: Joseph Campbell uses stories of the Buddha's life and enlightenment to reflect the essences of the Buddhist religion. He explains the difference between the two principal types of Buddhism-Theraveda (Hinayana) and Mahayana. Campbell also probes the differences between Eastern and Western religion by focusing on Buddhism as a religion of ""identification with"" the divine rather than one of ""relationship to"" it. He also compares Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism.

(8) Mythos - Our Eternal Selves
Date: 1997, Time: 57 min., Color, Rating: NR, Religion.
Content: Our Eternal Selves introduces us to the systems of yoga that grew out of the mainstream of India spiritually. Joseph Campbell demonstrates how the Eastern way of perceiving consciousness is radically different from how it is perceived in the West. He demonstrates how yoga acts as a meditation to bring the practitioner to ever higher stages of consciousness, to unite one's personal consciousness with the eternal, undifferentiated consciousness of the divine.

(9) Mythos - The Way To Illumination 2.4
Date: 1997, Time: 57 min., Color, Rating: NR, Religion.
Content: Perhaps the most sophisticated form of yoga, Kundalini Yoga, concentrates on the seven chakras or symbolic centers of our psychic energy. Joseph Campbell explains the full chakra system of Kundalini Yoga and compares with modern Western psychology and Christian concepts. Explore how this system teaches rituals and meditation practices to unite the spiritual power in the human being with the spiritual force of the universe.

(10) Mythos - The Experience Of God 2.5
Date: 1997, Time: 57 min., Color, Rating: NR, Religion.
Content: Joseph Campbell demonstrates how Tibetan Buddhists turn the ritual experience of death into a spiritual exercise. Trace with him the stages of the Tibetan Book of the Dead in which the Llama prepares a dying man and his family for the final moments of life. This passage, in fact, is the journey downward through the chakras, the centers of energy of Kundalini Yoga. Campbell reveals how the Eastern traditions reaches its most sophisticated expression in art, philosophy and mysticism in the Buddhism of Tibet.
