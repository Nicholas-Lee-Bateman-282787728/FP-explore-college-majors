2053371,4,B00020X83Y,"Is it me, or do a few of the animated episodes get cut off before the ending.  I'm thinking of Glomer's Story and one on disk four I believe.  It seems there should have been an additional track, but instead, the disk simply jumps back to the menu.
All that aside, I am amazed at how much I still enjoy this show.  I didn't anticipate much, bt the charm, warmth, and humor is still there.  Sure, at times it was a clunky, hoaky show but that just adds to the charm.
Well, worth the purchase.  However, season two with ""Perils of Punky"" is the real treasure.",1087430400,2,557,4.216981132075472
2053372,4,B00020X83Y,"How they can call this ""the COMPLETE first season"" is beyond me. It's missing the controversial Episode 24, in which Punky is kidnapped by Manitoban separatists. As we all know, NBC refused to air the episode due to the graphic violence and raw language (also, to avoid offending residents of rural Manitoba like myself). Still, it SHOULD have been included -- for the sake of the historical record, if nothing else.
Shame!",1087257600,5,423,4.888888888888889
2053373,5,B00020X83Y,"This is awesome. Amazon said it shipped yesterday, I'm sitting here watching it now. I never much cared for the cartoon so I'm not worried about that. You get all 11 hours of video for the price of 2 and it's a great trip down memory lane. They didn't touch the old episodes, so don't expect any trippy digital remastering, its just like the good old days. I love this DVD [set], and I hope they release the rest of the seasons (soon).",1086220800,,435,4.253012048192771
2053374,5,B00020X83Y,"I picked up the DVD yesterday, I was so excited I couldn't wait, I went right after work. I had been waiting for this release for a long time. I have love Punky since I was a kid, I even used to wear different colored tennis shoes to be like her, and I proudly wore my Punky snowboots! Anyhoo, this is a great set, it made me feel so happy watching it because it took me back to being a kid seeing them on TV. If you're like me, you'll have a smile on your face the whole time you watch it. Although, I cried a lot during the episode I love you Brandon, it's so sad. I haven't gotten the chance to watch the interviews or cartoons yet, but I'll make it to them today hopefully:)",1086134400,,678,3.9562043795620436
2053375,5,B00020X83Y,"I picked up the Punky Brewster dvd set for about $17 after I used a gift card.  I finished watching the whole series (I have yet to watch the cartoons though).  The dvds come packed in a fold out style case with a cover so you have to slide the case out and fold it open to get to the dvds.  The dvds are presented in full screem aspect the picture is clean which is good considering this is now 20 years old.  I had a fun time reminissing as I watched thinking to myself I remember this scene or that scene.  The extras are quite bear though no audio commentary I was hoping for some kind of cast reunion no subs of any kind no dolby or dts (I know its a tv show but it would have been nice) No interviews with George Gaynes Soleil Moon Frye or Casey Ellison who played Allen.  We do get however 2 hours of the spin off cartoon titled its Punky Brewster and interviews with Cherie Johnson and Ami Foster (Margaux Kramer)  both have matured very nicely I might add.  The other interviews are from Punky Brewster creator and executive producer David W. Duclon and Punky Brewster writer Barry Vigon.  There are a total of 4 interviews and each varies in length of 5 to 10 minutes or so. Here are the episode titles for each disc that make up season 1 23 episodes in total

I forgot to mention before there are 2 episodes of its Punky Brester on each disc  same thing with the interviews theres either one or two interviews per disc.  I wasn't personally disappointed that much I got a nice trip down memory lane for myself (I'm 26 now)  I just hope the remaining seasons 2-4 feature more extras.

She is 7 years old and the messages on Punky Brewster are fantastic for her.  I can't wait until June, 1st 2004.  I probably will watch it more than my daughter will and I'm 28 years old.  Don't get me wrong.  Punky Brewster! Punky Power! is great for any age.  I'm so happy she's back.

2053378,5,B00020X83Y,"Finally, all those petitions & waiting have come to an end! Punky is back! I am sooo psyched to get my hands on this dvd set since all I have are some poor vhs copies that I keep watching over and over.
Punky, Cherry, Margo, Henry and of course our favorite dog Brandon are sure to brighten your day with quirky 80s charm that I'm sure you will love if you were an 80s baby.  It's got the crazy clothing and fun antics you would expect in an 80s sitcom. I am only hoping that the first season will do well enough for the rest of the seasons to be released.

2053387,5,B00020X83Y,"Oh, it's an annoyingly annoying, sugary sweet, overly emotional, unbelievably unbelievable, 1980's family comedy.
Or is that how you vaguely remember it?

They don't make them like this anymore and here's why.

It was really good.

Family comedies of the 1970's and 1980's touched on social and moral issues, they pushed the boundaries and covered controversial topics. They had a simple message, do the right thing and love one another.
Family comedies weren't about political agendas or getting a laugh over derogatory jokes or outright slander against a celebrity or political candidate.
That was for primetime sitcoms like MASH and All in the Family, or late night shows like SNL.

Punky Brewster wasn't a show about putdowns or making someone or something appear bad for the sake of a laugh, it was about being a better person and loving the people and world around you. Confronting your problems or mistakes and making things right.

Sounds boring doesn't it? Makes you want to watch the Netflix series Fuller House where they bash Trump repeatedly, make fun of their real life drug problems, spend more time trying to get laid than the Golden Girls, and feature incredibly bad children actors.
I know, times change and that's what people want today.

Punky Brewster is timeless. I can sit my kids down in front of this show without concern... Shockingly, they love it!

I gave them a choice of watching Punky Brewster or Family Guy and Punky won out. Why? My youngest gave me an answer, ""Punky is like real life and you can tell that she and Henry really love each other. Family Guy is all about making fun of or putting down everyone and doing stupid unrealistic things.""
It's nice to have a show to balance out the crap  they watch when you're not looking.
On a side note, Bobs Burgers is a good modern family show. What? Yeah it really is!!! Some episodes are just sitcom nonsense, but they don't do politics, don't use fowl language, they are just trying to be a normal happy family. If anything, watch the Hawk and Chick episode and you will see what I mean. That one should have won an award.

Back to Punky, sometimes Soleil Moon Frye over-acts a little (primarily in the first season), but she almost always comes off as genuine. Henry is adorable (and completely unrelated to his Police Academy character. Yeah, that's where you saw him before, no need to look it up.)

We need more shows like this, the world would be a better place.",1489190400,6,2450,4.716627634660422

Since this was filmed before the digital age, the qualityt isn't that great. In fact it looks like something on VHS(And there are even a few instances where it looks like the tracking is off, or the tape stretches)...Still, I think this adds to the charm!

It also includes several episodes of the animated series...A cartoon show that I had never watched during it's original airing, so that was a nice bonus!",1478476800,2,560,4.77319587628866

Shame that it was just a teaser and the rest cost money.  No problem,  The whole series is available on YouTube, which they charge money for if we want to buy, so I guess that's the legal version there, too.  She's been binging on them ever since.

She wore funky, cool clothes - I do remember that. Basically, the show is not nearly as memorable as the rumor that was floating around back then that Punky Brewster had died in a plane crash. It's rumored that Spud Mackenzie also died in a plane crash, which was spread during the same time frame. I probably liked the show. I definitely remember the plane crash rumor.

This is my favorite kids TV show of all time! This & ""Small Wonder"" starrring Tiffany Brissette. This is a classic 80s kids TV show! This is also one of my 8-year-old sister's favorite TV shows of all time! My parents never liked this show for some reason.

For those who never seen or heard of ""Punky Brewster"", it's about a little girl named Punky Brewster (Soleil Moon Frye, ""It's Punky Brewster"", ""Saved By The Bell"") who goes on a trip with her mom & her dog Brandon after her dad walked out on them, but then her mom goes into a supermarket and ditches her for some odd reason and then, Punky & Brandon try to make a living somewhere in the city. One day, Punky & Brandon sneek into an apartment and they see Punky's best friend Cherie (Cherie Johnson, ""It's Punky Brewster"", ""Malibooty""). Punky ends up meeting a photographer named Henry Warnimont (George Gaynes, ""Police Academy"", ""Tootsie"") and Cherie's grandmother, Mrs. Johnson (Susie Garret, ""The Jeffersons"", ""Wicked Stepmother""). Henry sends Punky to an orphanage, leaving Brandon with Henry. She escapes. When Punky goes back to Henry, Henry's not as angry at Punky as she thought he'd be. Henry makes attempts to find Punky's mother, but fails everytime. Henry decides to keep Punky as his daughter even though he knows nothing sbout being father. He ends up being the best father she ever had even though Punky starts to be a pain in the butt for Henry even though Punky & Henry still end up having a good time together as a family. She ends up meeting an annoying guy named Eddie Malvin (Eddie Deezen, ""Zapped!"", ""The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out Of Water"") At school, people start to make fun of Punky's name, one likes to beat her up in one particular episode, she ends up meeting new friends who are very annoying and obnoxious, and she meets a teacher, Mike Fulton (T. K. Carter, ""The Thing"", ""Runaway Train"") who also works at the orphanage she was once at.

2053468,5,B00020X83Y,"I watched this show as a teen, and very young at heart even then, I truly loved this show. This show is wholesome as well as funny, having a valuable life lesson in each episode.

This show emphasizes a parent's unmerited love, the joy of differences as well as similar interests, and in later episodes: consequences of cheating (on a test), importance of not judging others (Halloween mishaps and revenge on a misunderstood elderly woman), and even CPR (class learns CPR just before Cherie gets stuck in a refrigerator), among others!

I would recommend this show to ANY household that has children, and anyone who is young at heart. I'm 41, and this show makes me feel 8 years old, right along with the others, except with my age and wisdom, I have insight I didn't have before. For instance, I always thought Margaux was little more than a stuck-up, spoiled little girl. However, when I watched ""Miss Adorable,"" I realized as I listened to Margaux tell Punky the ""importance"" of bringing home a trophy that she was receiving that very message from her own family, and was evidently not unconditionally loved at home.

Punky Brewster dealt with many of the issues that we faced in school and in our poorer neighborhoods. The show explained why it was bad to hide in refrigerators, why it was important to tell the truth,that it was okay to have your own style and that race doesn't matter.

2053497,4,B00020X83Y,"Ah...what sweet childhood memories this show brings back!  Setting the trends for mis-matched sneakers, bandannas and rainbow jackets, PUNKY BREWSTER is the definitive time capsule for 80's kids.  Soleil Moon Frye stars as Punky Brewster, a street-kid who is abandoned by her mother at a Chicago shopping centre.  Secretly living in an empty apartment in a building managed by widowed photographer Henry Warnimont (George Gaynes), Punky and her dog Brandon are fugitives from Child Services.  The last thing Henry needs is another mouth to feed, but he can't help but fall for the little moppet.  Punky quickly makes best friends with upstairs neighbours Cherie (Cherie Johnson) and her grandmother Betty (Susie Garrett), and pretty soon even old Henry himself!

Just watching the show again makes me smile, and travel directly back to a simpler time in my childhood.  Thankyou Shout! Factory for making this series available again.  Bonus features include brand-new interviews with stars Cherie Johnson and Ami Foster, creator David W. Duclon and writer Barry Vigon; and a selection of episodes from the Saturday morning cartoon series ""It's Punky Brewster"".

Episodes:

""Punky Finds a Home"" (Parts 1, 2 & 3) - In the special pilot episode, we first meet Punky as she's taken in by lonely apartment manager Henry and turns his world around.

""Punky Gets Her Own Room / Lost and Found"" - Punky and her friends set about decorating her own room, which includes a flower cart for a bed!  Punky and Henry's trip to the supermarket stirs up old feelings of abandonment for Punky.

""Walk Pool / Gone Fishin'"" - Henry agrees to take over supervision for the childrens' daily walk to school.  Punky and her friends spend a Saturday fishing trip with Henry.

""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" - The one time that Henry doesn't buy season tickets for the Chicago Cubs is the same year that they go to the play-offs, so Henry resorts to getting tickets from a scalper.

""Parents Night"" - Snooty Margaux Kramer (Ami Foster) tells Punky that foster parents aren't as important as real ones, and that Henry's absence at Parents Night is a foregone conclusion.

""Visit to the Doctor / Go to Sleep"" - Punky invents a wild note to excuse herself from getting her annual booster shot.  Punky stays up late with Henry to watch ""Die Fledermaus"" on television.

""Miss Adorable"" - Punky, Cherie and Margaux all compete in the ""Miss Adorable"" pageant hosted by Andy Gibb.

""Dog Dough Afternoon"" - After overhearing Henry complain about the costs involved in raising her, Punky decides to get a job.

""Bye Bye, My"" - Punky is heartbroken when Henry tosses her broken baby doll, My, down the trash shute.

""Yes Punky, There is a Santa Claus"" (Parts 1 & 2) - Henry is put into an impossible situation when Punky wishes for her missing mother to visit on Christmas Day.

""Punky in the Record Business"" (aka ""Play It Again Punky"") - Punky helps her piano teacher Tony (Andy Gibb) set his sights on a solo music career.

""Henry Falls in Love"" (Parts 1 & 2) - When Henry is unexpectedly reunited with his childhood sweetheart (special guest star Allyn Ann McLerie, Gaynes' real-life wife), Punky runs away, believing that she's no longer needed.

""My Aged Valentine"" - Punky punches her would-be valentine Conrad (Chad Allen), and is chided by her friends that if she doesn't find a boyfriend now, she'll be all alone when she is elderly.

""I Love You, Brandon"" - Brandon is run down by a car after accidentally eating Henry's prized new set of stamps.

""Punky Brewster's Workout"" - Watch out, Jane Fonda!  Punky, Cherie, Allen (Casey Ellison) and Margaux create their own fitness video when Henry brings home a movie camera.

""Gals and Dolls"" - Punky, Cherie and Margaux are crazy for the latest doll fad, ""Butter Lettuce Babies"", but when Henry only manages to buy one doll at the store, war is declared.

""Fenster Hall"" (Parts 1 & 2) - Punky befriends a tough street-kid named T.C. (Billy Lombardo) who has fallen into bad company.  Punky and Henry decide to take him to Fenster Hall, the city home for abandoned children, which is operated by Mike Fulton (T.K. Carter).  This episode was initially intended as a possible PUNKY BREWSTER spin-off, but instead the character of Mike returned in PUNKY's second season as her new schoolteacher.",1285286400,2,4311,4.8469945355191255

2053500,5,B00020X83Y,I was a huge Punky Brewster fan growing up. This was such a cute show. Each episode was both funny and educational by always including a message. What I have always enjoyed about Punky Brewster is that it's such a wholesome show that you can be proud to share with your children. Also included are some of the cartons from the Punky Brewster Saturday morning series. This is a 4-disc set in digipack. And it's a great set for anyone that enjoys classic family sitcoms.,1272067200,,468,4.517647058823529

2053502,5,B00020X83Y,"This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time.  If you haven't seen this show, I don't care how old you are - it's pretty much impossible not to fall in love with Punky!  And if you grew up in the '80s, it will bring back some great memories.  I was born in '76 and remembered watching Punky as a kid.  I wish they had shows for kids like this now; unfortunately I can't think of anything that even comes close.  The amazing thing is, unlike most of the stuff that's on now, this is actually funny!  I even found myself laughing out loud at this show now, at age 33!  I think adults and kids alike will love this show.  If you're a parent and want a funny, cute, sweet, wholesome show that will influence kids in a positive way, I can't see that you would be disappointed in Punky Brewster.  In an age where all the shows for little girls seem to be all about shopping and dressing like mini-adults (ie., ""sexy"") and also dating and having careers at younger and younger ages, this makes me long for the good old '80s, when a kid could just be a kid.  Well, maybe if enough parents demand shows like this, they'll eventually come back.  In the meantime, try this show if you haven't seen it; you won't be disappointed!",1263686400,2,1220,4.2155172413793105
2053503,5,B00020X83Y,"Punky season one is a great dvd set to have.  I recommend the whole series, but if you are just starting out in
collecting it or seeing it for the first time, you should start with season one to see how it all began.

Punky is a girl who has been abandoned by first her father then her mother.  She winds up at an apartment building where she meets Henry, the cranky but nice older man who takes Punky in as his foster child.  Yes the story is a little out there, but it is a good story in the show.

My favorite episodes are Punky Gets Her Own Room/Lost and Found-when Punky and Henry go grocery shopping; Miss Adorable which has a guest appearance by Andy Gibb; Gals and Dolls which alludes to the Cabbage Patch phenomenon of 1984, here known as Butter Lettuce Babies; Fenster Hall; Henry Falls in Love (check out Cherie's special Punky Pizza recipe as well as guest appearances by Henry's real life wife and Punky's real life brother); and Yes Punky, There is a Santa Claus-when Punky is told by a mean older kid at school that there is no Santa, Henry sets out to prove that there is.  It's a great one hour episode and one of my favorites of the whole series.

A great show and one of the best seasons.",1259539200,,1207,4.244541484716157

Punky is a poor young girl who gets abandoned when her mother takes her to Chicago and then leaves her at a shopping center and never comes back, and so when it becomes apparent to Punky that her Mother is gone, she winds up seeking shelter at an old housing complex and makes friends with a girl named Cherie, who sticks with her for the whole season, as well as Henry who is an old aging single man who lost his wife a year after marriage and never had a child and soon realizes he needs Punky Brewster when she starts growing on him. But then being a practical old man he calls for help and she is taken into an adoption shelter and then Henry fights in court to become a foster parent of Punkys and finally wins.

2053507,4,B00020X83Y,"""Punky Power!""  This adorable orphan, PUNKY, who ends up with an unlikely foster parent, older apartment manager/photographer, HENRY, takes us through her daily adventures with her dog, BRANDON, and best friend, SHERIE.  It's cute and full of montages, but often has subject matter that's a bit too serious and depressing, ie, Brandon almost dies - he doesn't, but another dog does at the hospital.  While this is a real life subject matter, I wasn't expecting it to be so heartwrenching.  My son was distraught.

Punky is a great little actress and fun to watch.  Her style and her underdog situation makes for entertaining episodes packed with silly adventures and comical mishaps.  It's nice that she's a confident girl, a nice role-model for young girls.  She's sweet and fair and is often left home alone like many young kids now who have working parents.

It is fun, but make sure your kids can handle the hard knox life before turning it on before bedtime in case it's an episode that explores life and death.",1226880000,,1016,4.826589595375722

2053509,4,B00020X83Y,"I thought that It was nice to see the show released to DVD. The quality is not as good as it should be in terms of picture... ""Punky in the record Business"" is one example as there are streaks in the video as Andy Gibb's character is teaching her a fun way to play the piano. The same type of video problem is noticed in the ""I Love You Brandon"" episode as well. NBC should have taken better care of the video in terms of storing the masters.

Still... This is one of the best shows to share with the kids. It was good to see Andy Gibb on 2 of the episodes... This was one of his first real acting jobs, aside from Gimmie a Break.. He was really good on the 2 episodes that he was on.

The interviews should have been put on one disc to make it easier to see them all at once without going from disc to disc to see what we want to see..

Shout factory did the best they could with the masters that they had.. In spite of some of the video quality on some of these shows, it is nice that we can finally look back and remember how fun childhood should be. Laugh, cry, and REMEMBER...

2053513,4,B00020X83Y,"Punky Brewster is one of those few TV shows that I remember watching and enjoying as a little kid. A little orphan name Punky is able to melt the hearts of all who know her... she's creative, spunky, and always full of optimism/spirit.

 When little Punky wanders into the apartment building of landlord Henry Wandermont who is cold, distant, reserved 60 year-old man when he initially sees Punky he decides he has to find a place for her. Despite his exterior deep down lies a kind-hearted man who loves Punky-for the simple fact they both are all the other has.

 There are some cute moments between Punky and Henry as they both try to adjust to the other through turning Henry's beloved study into a blinding, colorful room (without his knowledge), to finding a mutual hobby, and common parent-children relationship problems. The storyline is somewhat typical and I was able to find the two stories ""Pippi Longstocking"" to ""Annie"" that resemble characters/the show.

 The show itself is a little boring- there really is no problem, climax or storyline in the show... just one significant event that the show rests on.  This can be boring sometimes when you just watch Henry and Punky go to the grocery store together or go fishing with no real story/climax behind it. The stories are little dry because of this...

But despite this there is something eternally, enchanting about Punky.

 The show ""Punky Brewster"" is endearingly sweet. The character ""Punky"" is a truly creative, good natured, and lovely little girl who cares for everyone. Yet she has nothing and  gives EVERYTHING and is positive about everyone/everything for this spunky character the show is a real treat to watch and something that can be enjoyed by your children(as I did when I was little). Similar to ""Full House"" in some ways this shows that all families come in many shapes and sizes and the most important thing in the world is to have is someone you can home  too...

The only thing that my daughter is missing is her sidekick comet. But punky was my favorite growing up and seeing my daughter now with the same attitude, I want to see punky on tv so i can show her. I think she'd really enjoy it. I'm going to buy this package for her as soon as I can. I didn't realize that it would be so emotional. But then again it's going back twenty years on memory lane.

I wish they would re-air this thing on Nick at Nite (like they're doing with Full House...another favorite of mine) so the next generation of kids can enjoy it as we did! I have two young cousins ages 8 and 12 that discovered the Full House series when it started airing on Nick at Nite.

I really hope they consider this. Anyway, this is worth it and it's fun to watch while going down memory lane. I only have the first season and I'm going to buy the second season pretty soon.

2053516,5,B00020X83Y,"I LOVE Punky Brewster! I got this DVD set for my birthday and it has been just wonderful!

Punky Brewster is a GREAT family-friendly show! Its wonderful for all ages & is one of the few shows out there that a whole family can watch together without worrying about kids seeing graphic violence, or other inappropriate material.

For those who have not heard of, or had the chance to see this timeless 80's classic, Punky Brewster is about an adorable, and feisty 8 year old who was abandoned by her mother in a shopping center (after her father had walked out on them), She has been living in a vacant apartment, with her cute Golden Retriever puppy, Brandon, when she is found by the apartment building's manager, Henry Warnimont, a gruff, and grumpy photographer, who's been living alone, having isolated himself, both physically and emotionally since the death of his wife a year after their marriage.

At first Henry reluctantly takes her in, telling her that she can stay with him until Children's Services can find her mother. But then Henry and Punky begin to develop a close attachment to each other as the lovable Punky starts drawing Henry out of his shell, and making him feel emotion, and love once again.

Meanwhile, when it becomes apparent that Punky's biological mother cannot be found, and even does not want to be found, Children's Services takes Punky from Henry, and  places her at Fenster Hall, an emergency children's shelter. That's when Punky and Henry discover how much they miss each other and want to be together. After Punky runs away from Fenster Hall to return to Henry, then Henry realizes the difference that Punky has made in his life, and how much they really love and need each other. That's when Henry makes the decision to apply to become Punky's foster parent. Though there are some obstacles along the way, eventually Punky comes home to Henry.

So Henry and Punky become a family, and  the two of them grow closer and closer together as ""father"" and ""daughter"". The series explores the many ways in which they learn to share their lives with each other, and that's when the adventures begin!

Punky Brewster is a GREAT show! The minute I put in on, I am instantly transported back to my childhood. Man I miss those days! *sigh* Punky Brewster is one of my favorite TV shows! I CAN'T WAIT until all 4 seasons of this wonderful show come out on DVD! I am going to buy them all! When and if I have children someday, I want them to watch this great show too! Although at the rate I am watching it now, by then, I may need to buy a whole new DVD set of this series  LOL!!

While I love nearly EVERY SINGLE ONE of the episodes on this DVD set, I'd have to say that my MOST FAVORITE episode is the hourlong special episode, ""Yes, Punky, There is a Santa Claus"", the holiday episode where Henry tries to restore Punky's faith in Santa Claus and Christmas. Other favorite episodes include the 3-part series pilot episode, ""Punky Finds a Home"", , ""Lost and Found""/""Punky Gets Her Own Room"", ""Parents Night"", ""Miss Adorable"", the 2-part ""Henry Falls in Love"", and ""I Love You, Brandon"", among others -- though its a hard choice since I love ALL the episodes of Punky Brewster!

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Punky-Brewster-Season-One/dp/B00020X83Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Punky Brewster - Season One</a>&nbsp;also includes 8 episodes of the animated series, ""It's Punky Brewster"" cartoons, as well as interviews of Ami Foster (who played Margaux Kramer), Cherie Johnson (who played Cherie Johnson) and Executive Producer David W. Duclon, & Writer Barry Vigon.

I love both the real-life ""live-action"" show, as well as the animated series, ""It's Punky Brewster"" so this is a GREAT set with not only all the episodes from the Season 1, but episodes of the cartoon show as well!

However, even though I LOVE this DVD set, I still DO have one complaint, and a couple of quibbles about it.

First of all, my complaint (and IMHO, the biggest problem) with this set is the HORRIBLE packaging. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY HATE cardboard DVD boxes, or for that matter, ANY style of DVD cases that involves cardboard!

Rather than a cardboard DVD box holding ANOTHER cardboard box that unfolds and folds up/out (the style used for THIS set), I much PREFER the single plastic DVD case with an inner tray-rack to hold the discs (like the DVD case for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/7th-Heaven-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000HWZ4IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">7th Heaven - The Complete Third Season</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-The-Ninth-Year/dp/B00466H37M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: The Ninth Year</a>&nbsp;among others!) instead!

I am kind of anal about DVD sets (actually, DVDs & CDs in general!), and I HATE the cardboard box style of DVD case which often gets worn, scuffed, and/or peeling at the edges and corners of the box. In my experience so far, plastic DVD cases do NOT have those problems -- at most, the clear plastic sheet on the outside of the DVD case (into which the paper cover is inserted) *might* get a little wrinkled or soiled/dusty.

But the few wrinkles or soiling on the plastic cases is at least something I can live with, UNLIKE the significant scuffing & peeling into white spots/patches on the corners & edges of cardboard cases, which is really aggravating! That is why I'd much rather have a single plastic DVD case, which doesn't get much (if ANY!) edgewear, shelfwear, corner-wear, and/or scuffing & peeling, and is pretty much care-free!

In addition, I also have a couple quibbles about this DVD set.

The first is that there is NO special audio like Dolby Digital, Surround Sound, THX, or DTS. While the picture and sound are still relatively good, considering that this show was made in the 80's, it might have been EVEN BETTER, if it had been remastered with a 21st century audio system.

My other quibble is that there is NO closed-captioning or subtitles available on this DVD set. This is a minor quibble, but many DVD box-sets, at least have this one basic feature. Unfortunately Punky Brewster does not. Not only that, but with some of the other DVD's that do not have closed captions available, they have at least enabled TV captioning, such that if a TV has a closed-captioning feature built in, then it can still be possible to get captions. But with Punky Brewster, this feature has NOT been enabled, so it does not work.

It's a shame because everything else about this DVD set is so great. I just wish that Shout! Factory had considered those with disabilities or language issues and thought to include closed captions, and maybe even separate language tracks (with subtitles, of course!). Not only so that those who don't speak English, as well as those with hearing impairments (the deaf, the elderly, etc.) can watch this wonderful show, but also because sometimes, when Punky or another character is talking quietly or mumbling, its kind of hard to understand, and closed captions would help to decipher mumbled and/or softer-spoken dialogue.

Naturally, they would need to raise the price a little to cover that, but I, for one would not have minded (and would not mind) paying a little more for those important features when buying a DVD or especially a DVD box set!

Punky Brewster is still TRULY a GEM!!

Its really too bad that they just don't make shows like this anymore. I grew up in the 80's and this show is an instant blast to my childhood. The 80's had so many WONDERFUL (not to mention mostly family-friendly!). Punky Brewster, Webster, Mr. Belvedere, Perfect Strangers, Who's the Boss?, Full House, Family Matters, Baby Talk, Head of the Class, Family Ties, Growing Pains, Picket Fences, Life Goes On, and more!

Punky Brewster is a MUST for all 80's fans & 80s kids like me. I strongly encourage not only Punky Brewster fans, but ANYONE with young kids, anyone who is planning on having kids someday, or anyone who liked this show and wants to see a wholesome, sweet, and QUALITY ""family-friendly"" show (though admittedly, on occasion,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Punky-Brewster/dp/B00020X83Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Punky Brewster</a>&nbsp;CAN get a bit treacly saccharine-sweet) that everyone can enjoy, to buy this set of Punky Brewster!

They just don't make shows like this anymore. The 80's had many great shows. Family Ties, The wonder years, Perfect Strangers and Punky Brewster! Unlike today where every show has a cast of self absorbed models, the movies, and TV shows of the 80s spoke to the average person. Punky Brewster spoke to a generation of children, most living outside of the nuclear family (mother and father). The children of single parents could relate to Punky Brewster. If Punky could make it with both biological parents missing, we could make it with 1 parent. Punky was all about using your punky power to make the best of bad situations. We all needed that in the 80's and we still need that today.

I feel very grateful that I had such wonderful TV shows like Punky Brewster that were entertaining, creative, and helped to inspire good values.

2053541,5,B00020X83Y,"I have been waiting for this show to come out on DVD for years.  I just turned 21 years old on july 1st so Punky was definately my idol.  I even dressed up as her for Halloween in 1989...punky wasn't all that popular by then and i was upset when i didn't win a prize downtown for the costume because i looked exactly like her. (even had a stuffed brandon lol).  Anyways, Punky was the one show that meant the most to me growing up.  I remember when it was shown on the family channel until 1994.  So its been 10 years since I had really watched Punky.  I was thrilled to see that they included the cartoon episodes of Punky on the DVD.  I loved those as much as I loved the show.  I had the first 3 episodes (punky gets a home) on tape along w/2 cartoon episodes that my dad had taped for me years ago.  Its nice to know that I can keep this DVD for my kids to see.  That show changed my life and watching the 1st season episodes brings back so many memories.  I feel so old watching them!  I think that everyone should go out and buy this because it's worth it.  I hope they bring out the next 3 seasons because I want them all.",1089331200,12,1129,3.986607142857143
