8200321,3,B000RF9ZEA,The portion on Belgium was great.  A very good job was done presenting the culture and people of Belgium and World War I sites and history.  It was lacking however when it came to World War II.  They skimmed over the battle of the Bulge battleground.  With so much rich material I saw no reason to be superficial.  I was enormously disappointed in the segment on Luxembourg.  The rich history of the largest of the micro-states was hardly mentioned.  Even though Luxembourg was in the title only a few minutes was dedicated to it and its people.  The French Globe Trekker gave more time to Monaco even though that country does not appear in the title.,1443744000,,651,4.551724137931035
8200322,5,B000RF9ZEA,"One of my favorite episodes of GT. Katy Haswell is possibly the best presenter by far. Informative and enthusiastic,  Katy gave a very charming presentation of Belgium and much of what it has to offer. Not surprised to learn that Katy has been a news and other program presenter of BBC. That definitely makes a difference in the quality of the presentation. I also suggest GT's Ultimate London,

In that DVD, Katy conducts two sessions of ""historical walks"" in Westminster and Kensington. Hope to see her to present more destinations in GT!",1367020800,,694,6.440860215053763
8200323,4,B000RF9ZEA,This is a fine globe Trekker episode.  Wish it covered more and was up to date.  Thank you Globe Trekker,1363046400,,104,4.15
8200324,3,B000RF9ZEA,"Katy Haswell is my favorite Globe Trekker host. She has a lovely English accent. She's also the most mature out of all of the Globe Trekker hosts. She doesn't crack silly jokes like Megan McCormick. Nevertheless, she's passionate about traveling.

This episode was mediocre. Katy didn't do anything wrong. She showed all of the major attractions and historical sites. However, Belgum is simply not an interesting country. The only somewhat interesting part of this episode was the visit to the site of the Battle of Waterloo. She also visited the headquarters of the European Union and a distillery. She even made laces. None of the aforementioned activities interested me. Belgium lacks the history and attractions of Great Britain, France, Italy, and even the Netherlands. It's just another European country. There's nothing distinctive about it. I wish Katy did the Paris episode (instead of Justine Shapiro). I hate giving this DVD a bad rating since Katy is my favorite host and she looked so cute in this episode.",1361059200,,1019,5.1017964071856285
8200325,4,B000RF9ZEA,"I've watched just about every single episode of Globe Trekker.  I love the show hosts and how they explore their destinations in a not so conventional way.  This specific episode was a bit boring but it did cover most of the main aspects of Belgium and Luxembourg.  You can't blame the host though, the countries do not have much to offer anyway.  If you want a true Globe Trekker experience, try to find one where the host visits a third world country which is diverse in culture.",1354147200,,481,4.494252873563219
8200326,5,B000RF9ZEA,This video tour of Belgium is an excellent introduction to the country.  The tour guide makes the information exciting to hear and the locations are first class.  I plan to visit the Brussels area within the next few years and this video makes me want to go soon.,1292284800,2,263,4.458333333333333
8200327,4,B000RF9ZEA,"As usual, Globe Trekker does an excellent job of balancing historical background with travel how-to's. The video is a great introduction and was very helpful to us in planning our trip to Belgium! Enjoye",1196553600,6,203,5.0
