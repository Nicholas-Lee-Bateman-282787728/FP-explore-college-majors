8582302,3,B00CJ03YZM,"I would describe the music on this DVD as very diverse.  Meav is great as usual, but I would like her to sing more Celtic music.  I didn't like Rita's choice of music until she sang a Middle Eastern song, which is her strong suite. She might do well to sing American Blues, but otherwise she was the weakest of the three.  Yulia's talent and range of music is amazing:  she sings in Russian, English, and French.",1407542400,,412,4.311688311688312
8582303,5,B00CJ03YZM,The three ladies were awesome.  Really like Meav.  Scenery added a special effect to the DVD.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes great music.  will watch it again and again.,1395360000,,178,4.645161290322581
8582304,4,B00CJ03YZM,"Overall it was a wonderful performance!

Meav as usual gave a tour de force performance and the other two charming ladies Yulia and Rita were great as well. I found myself totally entranched when Yulia sung ""La Vie En Rose"", not only does she have a great voice but she also has a great stage presence. Rita I was impressed with as well but to be completely honest I feel that she was out of her element because as I understand it her background is in Pop, Rock, and Soul. I just feel the style and tone of the music being played wasn't the greatest match for her.

There were just a few other issues I had with this...

The first one is with the DVD itself, I was bothered that it didn't have biographies on the performers; I'm already a fan of Meav but if I want to learn anything about Yulia and Rita I have to look them up on my own. While with the concert I liked the music but I felt that much of it was similar in that it was very soothing and at a somewhat slow beat; I just wish they had a few songs with more of a ""bang"" to it. And I also felt that there wasn't much of a theme to the music selection, it seeemed a bit random at times.

But I still enjoyed it nonetheless",1379980800,,1181,3.9915254237288136
8582305,5,B00CJ03YZM,If you love any of these three Women you will love this DVD as well as its cd. Was wonderful getting introduced to two new singers who I am going to enjoy getting their music.,1376006400,,175,4.0285714285714285
8582306,5,B00CJ03YZM,"The Angelic voice of Meav makes this concert DVD the beauty in music that it is. Her ""First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"",
""My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose"", and, especially her ""On Raglan Road"" are  lovely. And, then, she surprises us
with the beautiful ""Glasgow's Burning"", which is phenomenal. While the other ladies' songs are pretty, it is Meav that
makes this DVD beautiful. ""Shenandoah"" is wonderful!! I recommend this DVD to all music lovers.",1374883200,2,447,4.658227848101266
