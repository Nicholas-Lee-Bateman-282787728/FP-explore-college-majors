When I received the DVDs I exitedly opened one and it did not work....when I called I was told it only worked in Egypt, Germany and more European places....

Why would I want it here? There was no warning on the DVD, it just said for Region 2...who was I to know what that meant? When I tried to return it, I was told there was no refund if it was opened. Amazon graciously refunded two of the DVD's and instructed me to return ALL the DVD's to Herman. After 3 years of fighting, they have not refunded the money as promised after Amazon intervened, stating they had sent a check!
This kept me from going back to Amazon..until recently: for a toilet seat. Made in the USA.",1255737600,,695,4.225563909774436
