261165,5,6300208354,"Four Faces West is a superb little Western, and it is satisfying to see it released on DVD. McCrea, Frances Dee [his real life wife], Charles Bickford [Dee's father], and Joseph Calleia head a fine cast. McCrea is eminently believable; his trademark taciturn, self-effacing character is captivating--not a single shot is fired in the entire movie! Bickford's Pat Garrett is also a stand out. Now, let us hope that some of McCrea's other oaters get released---maybe RAMROD (with Veronica Lake), or the playful SADDLE TRAMP (with John McIntyre) and CATTLE DRIVE (with Dean Stockwell). And there is STRANGER ON HORSEBACK, another superb little Western....and RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY, already on VHS, desperately needs DVD release.",1064188800,54,725,5.3130434782608695
261166,4,6300208354,I liked the movie and have been trying to find it for a long time . black and white but still a good movie. Joel McCrea is good as always in this western made in 1948.

261199,5,6300208354,"It seemed weird but, as the movie developed the Paso por aqui began to make sense to me. It was less about being a western and robbing a bank, as unusual a robbery as it was, than about someone 'passing this way'. I loved the movie and the fact that McCrea and Dee were real life husband and wife made the story even more delicious. They couldn't hide their true love as they played their roles. And the character played by Joseph Calleia [Monte Marquez] is delightful as a kind of foil for McCrea's predicament. Bickford is good, too, as Pat Garrett.

Good man steals money for a good reason although it is still a crime.  He decides to repay the theft on his own although the female lead certainly influences him to take the high road.  He helps a Mexican family recover from a terrible illness instead of fleeing into Mexico for safety, subsequently being arrested by Pat Garrett, who shows a kindly side he never actually had.

(Believe me, you'll want to watch this more than once, just to get your head around what a wonderful job this fine character actor does with this role.)

This is a feel-good movie based on a classic western novel, 'Paso Por Aqui', written by Eugene Manlove Rhodes. The casting is superb, the location filming breathtaking~~even in black and white.

I wasn't disappointed.  Once more, I was thrilled and star-struck by the strong, soft-spoken cowboy, Joel McCrea who, after all these years, still sat ""Tall in the Saddle.""  And Francis Dee (McCrea's actual wife) still made me jealous !!  They were supported by a strong cast of memorable actors, including Charles Bickford (sheriff) and a wily little Mexican bandito leader that makes one laugh.

My only complaint was that the movie was still not long enough.

261422,5,6300208354,"Allied Artists Pictures presents ""FOUR FACES WEST"" (1948) (89 min/B&W) -- Starring Joel McCrea, Frances Dee, Charles Bickford, Joseph Calleia, William Conrad & Martin Garralaga

Directed by Alfred E. Green

When the family land is threatened with foreclosure, honest, hard-working rancher Ross McEwen (Joel McCrea) resorts to bank robbery in order to come up with the necessary cash. Although he leaves the bank an I.O.U., Sheriff Pat Garrett (Charles Bickford) is sent out to catch the criminal as he flees to escape capture.

In his trek across the desert McEwen comes upon a Mexican family who are desperately ill. They will die if he refuses to help and proceeds on his original journey. He shows his true nature and interrupts his pilgrimage to care for the family. Pat Garrett, who has sworn to catch the outlaw, overtakes McEwen at the poor hovel. The climax is suspenseful and is a fitting conclusion to this fine Western adventure which was originally titled ""They Passed this Way"".

Frances Dee who plays Fay Hollister, a nurse who tends McEwen's wounds, was Joel McCrea's real-life wife (they were married for 57 years!) - the pair had also combined more than 10 years earlier for Wells Fargo (1937).

McCrea appears to have been very much his own man, he never overplayed any of his many roles. His presence here does nothing that calls attention to himself, ringing true with an air of quiet nobility, and the effect is deep and emotional.

Special Footnote: -- Not a single shot is fired nor is one punch thrown in director Phil Green's ""Four Faces West"" -- The film was produced by Harry ""Pop"" Sherman who was the original producer of the Hopalong Cassidy series. Hoppy was as noble a western hero you can get, and that's what Sherman gives us here through the Joel McCrea character!

261425,4,6300208354,"After robbing a bank of $2000, cowboy Ross McEwen (Joel McCrea) flees the small desert town of Santa Maria.  The `great manhunter of the southwest,' Pat Garrett (Charles Bickford) is soon on his trail, starting a movie-long chase to capture the outlaw.  The story is taken from Eugene M. Rhodes `Paso Por Aqui,'  They Passed Here, that was first serialized in the Saturday Evening Post in 1926, later published as a novel.  The title refers to a big rock formation in New Mexico on which passing travelers carved their names.  If there are a million stories in the naked city, then, as evidenced by the rock, there are at least several hundred in the great southwest.

 McEwen, on the run, gets bit by a rattler, hops a passing passenger train, and meets a pretty young nurse from the east who is traveling west to work in a small frontier hospital.  The nurse is played by Frances Dee, McCrea's real-life wife, and her character's considerable talent at wrapping a tourniquet around a snake bite is second only to her ability to get McEwen to do the right thing, which, in this case, is turning himself over to Garrett before the bounty hunters get to him.  That McEwen did a bad thing for a good reason - Here's the money for the farm, Pa - probably goes without saying.  That McEwen and the nurse are a bumpy carriage ride and abbreviated trainboard conversation away from falling in love is no less surprising.

Even including the presence of the free agent bounty hunters there's not a lot of tension in FOUR FACES WEST.  Bickford's Garrett is thoughtful and compassionate and we know if he captures McEwen he'll treat him fairly.  The movie gathers some wool during its first couple of acts, but gathers steam in its third when McEwen gets serious about crossing the border into Mexico.  The location shots are gorgeous, McEwen's wiliness in foiling the persistent Garrett ingenious.  McEwen's last-reel flight takes him to the cusp of the border, a half-day's ride to Mexico and freedom, when he comes upon a Mexican family desperately ill with diphtheria....  And that, I think, is where the full whoomph of this movie has surrendered to time.  The other major character in FOUR FACES WEST is a Mexican, Monte Marquez, a successful Alamogordo businessman.  Marquez is played by Joseph Calleia (who, ironically, is Maltese rather than Mexican.)  That McEwen, or any western hero, might befriend a Mexican and possibly stop to help needy Mexicans, was rare in 1948.  To that extent FOUR FACES WEST was pushing the envelope of social tolerance, even if modern audiences have to look to see it.  Otherwise this is a good enough movie about the good guy beneath the bad guy surface.  The location photography verges on the spectacular, and, as always, McCrea is a laid back and comfortable presence.",1151193600,14,2802,4.79375
