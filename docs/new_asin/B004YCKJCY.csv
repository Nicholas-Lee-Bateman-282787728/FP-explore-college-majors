4498701,5,B004YCKJCY,I was looking for something small to add to a Christmas gift and this was such a good find! The price is great and you get 10 full-length movies! Any child will be excited to open this up! Highly recommend. There are several theme packs...  check out all of them!,1324598400,6,263,4.26
4498702,5,B004YCKJCY,"Some of the movies on here are just plain corny and not something an adult would enjoy; but an 8 year old might or a 10 year old or even a 12 year old. None of them are classics or superb movies. But there is a large enough selection that you should be able to find something most everyone can agree on. I particularly like that you get ten movies on two dvds in one package. It sure cuts down on space and waste of packaging like this. Bailey's Billions is a favorite for my children.

Worth they Money.
Enjoy.",1323043200,28,511,4.11
