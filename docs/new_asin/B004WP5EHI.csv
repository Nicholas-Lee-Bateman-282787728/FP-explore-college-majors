8445535,4,B004WP5EHI,Nice variety of touring tales. Not full stars for rating just because of production quality.,1491264000,,92,5.2
8445536,5,B004WP5EHI,"I really enjoyed this DVD, and it says volume 1.  Where are the other volumes??  I can't wait for them to create some new ones, I've been waiting for 4 years!  Buy this DVD, you'll love it!",1422230400,,189,4.054054054054054
8445537,4,B004WP5EHI,Full of great information.,1412812800,,26,5.75
8445538,3,B004WP5EHI,Not bad.,1412640000,,8,3.5
8445539,5,B004WP5EHI,"I purchased this DVD because I know of the exploits of several of the presenters but have never been to one of their talks. Rene, Peter and Kay and Tiffany are spellbinding for me. Their talks and slides of their travels still up the wanderlust in me, though it is unlikely I will ever undertake anything as challenging as an around the world tour. Greg's presentation was OK but for whatever reason he didn't ""speak"" to me in the same way the other three did. Don't expect that this is an action DVD where you will see movies of their tours. Rather, this is a recording of these folks talking to a HUBB gathering about their adventures with slides. For me it was worth every penny.",1332633600,,682,4.420634920634921
8445540,2,B004WP5EHI,"I expected more than live recordings of speaking engagements.  Indeed, the riders have impressive stories to tell, and to attend their events might well have been inspiring, but setting up a camera and recording their slide shows does not capture the power of their journeys.  The motorcycle riders, while great adventurers, are not great speakers.  Their monologues quickly become tedious and the video becomes another installment in the infamous tradition of slide-show monotony. Add in tacky backgrounds behind the talking heads and occasional poor sound quality and there is not much to like visually or aurally about this DVD.  I am going to give my copy away--if anyone will take it.",1323820800,2,689,5.18018018018018
8445541,5,B004WP5EHI,Grant & Susan pull it off again with great collection of four interviews. Rene makes information hilarious and the others all have invaluable contributions to motorcycle travel. Besides who can't like supporting a couple that makes a living doing what they love.,1322006400,,262,5.261904761904762
8445542,5,B004WP5EHI,"I've watched the entire Achievable Dream series three times (all 18 hours) and look forward to this series as well. If you want to know what it takes to ride your motorcycle around the world, there is no better focused resource than Horizons Unlimited for the nitty gritty details.",1321920000,,281,4.755102040816326
8445543,5,B004WP5EHI,"Just finished watching this incredible DVD.... It will take your motorcycle traveling to another level. The ONLY thing these motorcycle travelers/adventurers haven't done, is ride on water itself. Otherwise, they have ridden on every terrain possible: muddy, snowy, gravely, sandy & a combination of all mentioned terrains, & they have the pictures to prove it.

Also check out the first series of DVD by HU, on how to prepare yourself & your bike to take such a trip.....",1305763200,,472,5.051282051282051
8445544,5,B004WP5EHI,"If you're curious about motorcycle travel to far-flung places, you owe it to yourself to watch this video. Upon viewing, you soon get the point that these people are ""regular Joes"" who decided to do something BIG, and had a great time learning the ropes along the way. They are all entertaining speakers, and guaranteed to make you laugh out loud!

Lots of amazing stories and even more amazing photographs, it's great fun and very inspirational.

We have watched all the other Horizon's Unlimited videos, and can heartily recommend every one of them.
