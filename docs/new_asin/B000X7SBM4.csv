Mediocre kung fu, mediocre plot, bad English dubbing

The only interesting thing about this movie at all
is that it seems to be the inspiration for Bruce Lee's ""Game of Death""
in that it involves the daughter of a general working her way

8227152,2,B000X7SBM4,"Great movie, but when I made the purchase I was expecting the English dub of the film. The product details on Amazon listed that the Audio was in English, but when I started watching the movie the language of the film was in Mandarin with English subtitles. Now that I've started watching the movie I can't get a refund per Amazon's order cancellation policy. Usually this wouldn't bother me because I watch a lot of Asian films with the subtitles, but since the product details on Amazon said that the audio was in English, that's really what I was expecting when I made the purchase. Now I'm stuck with this movie instead of another Shaw Brothers movie I could've watched that included the English dub.",1526169600,,704,4.64
8227153,4,B000X7SBM4,"I see some older 1 and 2 star reviews of this film but I believe there was a mix-up with another film.  This fantastic movie has Ti Lung and Alexander Fu Sheng and other familiar great actors.  It's a perfect depiction of the process of being accepted into the temple, then doing menial labor which builds the beginners strength in order to later master the different styles of fighting.  There is gripping intrigue and betrayal, heroic sacrifice and mind-blowing action all set within the classic Shaolin rebellion against the Qing dynasty.  What's not to love?",1502323200,,562,4.88421052631579

8227155,5,B000X7SBM4,"Movie is in Mandarin, but the English closed caption seemed accurate and there are plenty of time to read without having to rewind.  To understand this movie, you need a small bit of context.  Shaolin Temple has been a well respected Buddhist temple known for their high quality kung-fu, and was regarded as a valuable component of China during the Ming Dynasty (Ming Emperors).  However, the Ming Dynasty was over taken by the Qing Dynasty, which is the new set of emperors.  During the Ming Dynasty, the emperors had a close relationship with the Shaolin Temple, and that made the Qing Dynasty felt threatened by these high level martial artists.  So, the Qing emperor added spies at the Shaolin Temple during a vulnerable period when the temple was lacking students, which had caused the temple to accept new students who seem to be able to handle pain and suffering.  The Temple was looking for students who were not greedy and determined to learn the Shaolin way of life (no women, no meat, no alcohol, no greed, no drugs, no harm to others, etc.).  Students often spent years learning their particular kung-fu skills.  Some learn certain styles of fist fights, weapons, jump skills, etc.  Each specialty is displayed in this movie.  Students are not allowed to leave the Temple without permission as everyone plays a role in operating the temple.  Some cook, some clean, etc.  However, students who want to leave without permission must fight their way out, normally not to the death, but in this case the spies wanted to kill the students who were seeking revenge against the Qing Dynasty.  Most Shaolin kung-fu movies are based on this premise during this period of transition between the Ming and Qing Dynasty when Shaolin was threatened and destroyed by the Qing Dynasty because the Qing Emperor was afraid these high skilled fighters might rebel against the new enperor.  However, Shaolin survived through centuries as the students spread across China to teach Shaolin kung-fu and their values even to this day.  This movie gives you an insight into how disciplined Shaolin students were and how they learned their different styles of kung-fu.",1494806400,,2154,4.944444444444445
8227156,5,B000X7SBM4,"Classic !  This movie is also known as "" Death Chambers ""  The Great Abbot of the Shaolin Temple  realized that  before the decree of the Emperor of the Qing Dynasty will destroy the Shaolin temples, they have to let laymen into their temple and  train them to fight against the Qings. One monk opposed the decision of their master since he is a traitor and  is secretly working for the court. Fang Shih Yu is portrayed  by Fu Sheng ; Ma Chao-hsing ( Chi Kuna Chun ) and others. Endurance and the determination to bear suffering are the tests of the Shaolin monks before they are trained according to the style thatfits their endurance and character.
 In another setting , notable Ming soldiers Tsai Te-cheng (Ti Lung), Hu Te-ti (David Chiang), Yen Yung-chun (Szu Shih), and Ma Fu Yi (Wang Lung Wei) have escaped from the Qing soldiers and  arrived on a village near the Shaolin temple. Three more students withstood the tests  of the monks after several days without food and water and were accepted into the temple, Huang Sung Han (Lee I min )  Lin Kwong Yao (Kuo Chui), and Hu Hui Chien (Tsan Tan).  Things begin to go sour at the temple due to the treachery of Hai Hsein and Ma Fu Yi and it is eventually attacked by tThe movie entails loyalty, treachery of a monk who gave information for the Qing soldiers to conquer and vanquish the Shaolin Temple. Thousands of monks have been killed  and the temple was burned. In the end, only eight Shaolin devotees escaping the ensuing massacre.",1489708800,,1490,4.535580524344569

8227159,5,B000X7SBM4,"This is a review of the movie Shaolin Temple (1976) This has been one of my favorite movies since watching at first as a kid.  The plot is interesting and shows how common people became Shaolin disciples and were instrumental in staving off the Qing army.  It also contains some humor but the best part is the martial arts.  The fighting scenes at the latter part of the movie were done well.  It stars some of the great kung fu stars of that era: Ti Lung, Fu Sheng, David Chiang, Chi Kuan Chun, Johnny Wang and the Venoms (pre-Venom days).  The director Chang Cheh is one of the best directors, if not the best, of Kung Fu Cinema.  I watched this on Amazon Prime but also have the DVD.  This movie is also called Death Chambers.  You can also watch 5 Shaolin Masters which is the continuation of this story and features some of the same actors (Ti Lung, David Chiang, Fu Sheng).",1483142400,,879,4.3496932515337425
8227160,3,B000X7SBM4,The movie itself is great.  The picture quality is also surprisingly good as well.  But the transfer from the widescreen is horrific.  Most scenes have characters cut off or important elements offscreen.  It ruins the movie.  What a shame.  This is a problem with Celestial Pictures and nothing to do with Amazon.,1482969600,,313,4.923076923076923
