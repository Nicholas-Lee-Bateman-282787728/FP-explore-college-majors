8748007,5,B01APXH90A,This was a GREAT workout! Easy to follow and fun to do!,1533686400,,55,3.6666666666666665
8748008,2,B01APXH90A,"If you enjoy moving seamlessly between moves and getting your heart rate up, this is not the workout for you. There is way too much downtime between moves which allows your heart rate to come back to almost resting which is the complete opposite of what I want from a workout. Her moves are effective and I might have liked the workout better if she saved all the stretching for later. I was soooo bored that I had to finally turn it off. This is probably best for beginners or people who hate workouts that are strenous.",1480982400,,521,4.381443298969073
8748009,5,B01APXH90A,"No need to preview this workout JUST DO IT! Michelle gives precise cue's that allow you to get right into it. I would like to call this workout Strengthen & Stretch. After each segment worked there is a very good deep stretching session which really does feel so good & has a restorative effect in anticipation for the next thing (such as ab work). Superb sequencing & targeted toning! Michelle you really make this look easy & it is not! The resistance band really packs a punch and I would recommend having one especially for the leg work. If you need to move around allot in your workout you won't get that here. Tone & Tighten is more TARGETED and it digs deep into the muscles you are working on in that segment... so so nice to do such small targeted moves & feel like you lifted the empire state building after the workout is through. The stretching sequences are bliss when they come. All her 'reminders' for posture correction & breathing were very good! That helped me allot b/c it's easy to let go of proper posture/form during those fatigue moments, so the cue's were needed (by me anyway). I am glad I have this workout!! Thanks, great workout Michelle!",1473465600,3,1166,4.530805687203792
8748010,5,B01APXH90A,I was a couch potato. I hate the gym. And then I discovered Work it. It changed my life. The third class I took there was tone and tighten. It was the best workout ever. Very effective without straining any part of your body. It's the most intense work out I ever did and I used to go to the gym 3 times a week with a trainer. i liked it so much that I got the video. And it's amazing. It's like being in the class in the studio. Michelle is able to motivate you even through the video. She is a fantastic instructor. And she is an amazingly nice and funny person. She makes you smile even when you exercise with the video and you don't realize how much you worked every major group of muscles in your body. And you don't even sweat. In the time it takes you to work one group of muscles in the gym you have worked several parts of your body with this video. And you don't need any fancy equipment. It makes you want to exercise. You want to get fit fast? This is the way to go!,1457308800,,978,3.969543147208122
