8203575,5,B000S0GCBS,"""La Riffa"" (The Raffle"") is a sweet early vehicle for Italian beauty Monica Bellucci. I 'd state at the outset of this 'review' that the 5 star rating I'm bestowing upon the flik is largely based on an arbitrary 'Monica watching' scale that assesses such 'important' elements as : how much screen time does Monica get, how hot does she look, and are there any nude scenes?  Based on this 'stringent' criteria, La Riffa is a Bellucci bonanza!  As has been noted by a previous reviewer this film does not seem to be available anywhere (yet) with an English translation (the disk I purchased was from Greece w/ Greek subs over the Italian sound track) so one must be content to just watch as the simple plot unfolds (or rush out and take Italian lessons).  The story line follows Monica's character in the aftermath of her husband's death in a car accident as she must come to grips with the reality that her, seemingly affluent, husband left a lot of debts behind and she must sell off virtually all of her possessions (including the clothes off her back in one delightful scene!) in order to make ends meet.  After this financial avenue is exhausted someone suggests that she 'raffle' off herself as a prize to a wealthy admirer to get some more money to pay the bills, and apparently complications ensue. Much of this 'action' is rendered somewhat nebulous by the lack of English but in the final analysis it's really all about watching Monica go through her paces, and in that regard La Riffa is a winner.  This is one of Bellucchi's earliest films and her beauty is at a youthful peak making her a sheer delight to view. The plot presents several opportunities for scenes with exotic apparel and there are 3 solid nude sequences to be enjoyed.
Despite the (minimal) frustration of not being able to understand the dialog, this film is a stellar opportunity to sample the qualities that have raised Ms Bellucci to the ranks of international stardom.  Highly recommended for fans of Monica.",1309305600,6,1990,4.687679083094556
8203576,4,B000S0GCBS,"I have the Italian release of this film.  But I see Amazon only carries the Korean version.  Same movie so guess I'll review it here.  When Monica releases a movie I buy it.  it's that simple.  Now will I rate it 5 stars?...no, unless it deserves it.  You really have to like Monica's work before diving into her pre-Malena career.  The average watcher will not.  La Riffa cannot be found with english subtitles...so another reason the average viewer wouldn't bother with this title.  If you like Monica's films enough to look into getting this film then great.  Some of Monica's early work is her best.  La Riffa is a very early Monica film, nearly her first feature role.  She has alot of screen time, she is very young, and addictive to watch.  WARNING Viewing this film could be the start of a Bella Bellucci Obsessione!",1197331200,29,824,4.6
