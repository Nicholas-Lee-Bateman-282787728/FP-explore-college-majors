624957,5,6303295657,"This it IT!  I have been waiting for NOVA to release this episode on video.  Get this tape!  I can't imagine anyone not being spellbound by the process of constructing these ancient machines of war; the scholarship, the research, the craftsmanship and just the coolness of seeing these huge machines fling their payloads into a castle wall is too amazing!  Want a taste of what you will learn?  OK, ponder this - the wheels on these catapults are not for transportation!",971222400,6,470,4.753086419753086
624958,5,6303295657,"This is a very well-done documentary about two midieval historians who take on a mission: given two weeks, build a trebuchet and use it to knock a hole in a 5-foot thick castle wall 200 yards distant.
The documentary  covers the little known history of this amazing siege weapon, and let me  tell you, it's really incredible seeing these contraptions chucking  250-pound stones around.  One of the historians has build a smaller-scale  model that throws small upright pianos and 55-gallon drums of flaming  napalm, and the other has built an even smaller scale model that throws  rocks across an indoor hall.  The bigger of the two full-size ones is  almost 5 stories high!
The other episodes in this series are good also,  but there's just something truly amazing about watching these wood-and-rope  machines knocking holes in big walls.
At the end, one of the historians  observes (in a cultured British accent): ""I think it's plain that  given a team of builders and a couple of weeks, you can knock a castle into  powder.""",950227200,3,1026,4.855491329479769

7843529,2,6303295657,"The Ancient Romans left no blueprint for how they made baths.  Engineers and scholars in this program try to recreate things.  This attempt may have been of interest, but the problems faced by the modern planners happened due to time constraints they placed on themselves.  The narrator stated that it probably took months to make a bath 2,000 years ago.  We learn much interesting stuff here.  The Ancient Romans didn't have soap.  They disliked hairy bodies, but I sho would argue that Italian men are known for being hirsute individuals.  They compared Roman baths to modern-day Turkish harams.  Theres a gray area here.  The narrator admits that Ancient Romans would have been naked at the baths, but they show the scholars entering the baths wearing towels.  On the one hand, no one was hurt not getting to see the older, flabby bodies of the interviewees here.  However, don't sleep: some scholars are sex radicals and have big egos.  I bet some of the scholars recorded would too have been bold enough to be filmed butt-booty naked!  They could argue they wanted to be historically accurate, after all.  I do think the topic of sex may have been avoided.  I am no scholar of Ancient Rome.  However, I suspect that Roman citizens may have also had access to female and male prostitutes at the baths.  If they enjoyed fresh fruit, massages, and good conversations at the baths, then why not some sexual contact too??  Think about it.",1428451200,,1438,4.776422764227642

7843531,5,6303295657,"This in depth, detailed story of Don's discovery got me deeply interested in human origins.  At 45, I returned to college to take some courses I thought I would enjoy.  Our Anthropology teacher played this for us.  I borrowed it from her and put it on a 6 hour VHS  tape along with ""Dawn of Man"" (the one narrated by Richard Dreyfuss),  and used to put it on when I laid down to sleep.  I started reading all I could and recording any shows on our human story.  I eventually got to meet Ian Tattersall, who introduced me to Don.  I was lucky enough to go to Madagascar with them,  Don and Ian are two of the most fun guys to hang with....they're like a comedy team.  This 2 hour story is still good and Don introduces many of his friends and colleagues to chip in their part of Lucy's story.  My hat's off to all those unknown scientists out there who spend their lives - sometimes in primitive and/or hostile environments - tediously pursuing the details of our world and our history.....Only a handful will ever have the luck and the opportunity to make a discovery such as LUCY.  Don was not only lucky,  his dedication and hard, hot days in the Ethiopian Awash Valley put him into the world's spotlight,  and he has that ""right stuff""  to connect to the millions of people who have attended his lectures in a way most others in this field just cannot.  I was honored to be there when the Explorer's Club awarded him their ""LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT MEDAL!""  He is a fun character to be around,..and when Ian is added to the mix,  the fun never stops.",1414368000,,1549,4.375438596491228
7843532,5,6303295657,I saw this video in my anthropology class and immediately came to Amazon.com to purchase it and the companion videos from the series. Excellent and highly watchable. I can't wait to view the others!,1078272000,3,198,4.852941176470588
7843533,5,6303295657,"This is absolutely THE coolest video that you'll ever purchase!  I originally saw this on PBS when it first aired back in 2000 and I was transfixed for the ENTIRE show!
Unlike some of the other ""How did they build that?"" series that I've seen on TV, NOVA, the engineers, and the timber framer crews did their best to actually build these ""weapons of mass destruction"" just like they would have 7 centuries before - with only wood, rope...and a lota' sweat!  (Wait to you see the 14th century lathe they constucted to make the hinge pin with.)
Even if you aren't into warfare, seeing 250 lb. sandstone balls...hurled at a simulated and realistic castle wall...200 yds. away...at over 125 MPH...with startling accuracy...is just down-right fascinating!  (Let's see an NFL quarterback do THAT!)
I'm still patiently waiting for the DVD but I might have to break down and purchase this on VHS if it doesn't come out soon.  Worth every penny...and then some!",1055462400,2,952,4.822085889570552
7843534,5,6303295657,"We watched this video in our technology class before we built our own trebuchets (we have a maximum height limit of 3 feet to launch a foosball 75 feet- the weight:distance ratio is the same as the men use in the video).  It was really helpful, but moreover, it was really interesting to learn about medieval seige weapons and to watch how one was built.  Following the trials of the men launching their own trebuchet was very engrossing, and gave me great ideas for bulding the one I'm working on now.  If you're thinking of building your own trebuchet, this video is a must!",1049155200,2,576,4.519230769230769
