8228064,3,B000XDXREK,"I have not yet seen similar productions, so no chance to compare. The directing Lady Ph D was very fresh, friendly and encouraging couples to communicate and not be shy. Sensate focus exercises, like it is said above, slow things down, so the arousal increases while one is f.ex. restricted to just caressing and exploring the partners face by hands. To me there was too much focus on strap-ons - so as a lesbian lover you seem to be just an imperfect man and need a dildo to give real pleasure to one another. Also the long fingernails and the body-shave of the actresses didn't match my taste - maybe it's a cultural difference. I liked that after ""exercise"" the couples discussed how they felt as ""giver"" or ""receiver"" and they seemed to really care. Masters and Johnsons therapy is meant to help couples overcome difficulties. Usually couples don't need lessons on how to make love. Of course the tape might be pleasurable for men.",1205280000,12,935,4.672727272727273
8228065,5,B000XDXREK,"My girlfriend and I bought this DVD because it looked different from the other videos that came up when we searched Amazon.  The exercises are about increasing intimacy and not focusing solely on orgasms and the ""goal"" of sex.  We've seen other videos like this, but they were all straight couples, and while you can still learn from them, it's really nice to be able to watch couples that look like you!  The girls are very sexy in the L Word kind of way.  The therapists did a good job of explaining the exercises and going step by step.  They didn't talk too much either, but once they finished explaining a little bit they just let the couples demonstrate.  We also liked the section on anatomy - it's nice to get a refresher on what is where!  The questions and answers that they had at the end were interesting too.

We had a lot of fun watching it and using the exercises.  They definitely help slow things down and take the focus off of always just having sex to get off.  It was nice to see couples who look like they're really into what they're doing - they talked afterwards, and seemed like they really got a lot out of what they were doing.  Would definitely recommend it for couples.",1196899200,32,1197,4.3954545454545455
