8195885,4,B000QEJ128,"This is a terrific course IMHO... I already have the Gnomon Workshop DVD ROM for Maya Dynamics for Outer Space and though this Underwater one is shorter, I think I prefer this one (though both are excellent.)

This one here comprises nine lectures, each around a half-hour, showing how different aspects of an underwater environment are created.

So... a general overview of the underwater environment, such as caustics from light, water surface scattering and patterns, fog which affects how far into the distance one can see, bottom geometry with undulating sea bottom, rocks and seaweed/grass etc. There's also the underside of a small boat, which drops anchor and so results in dynamics of the anchor's rope, bubbles, turbulence from displaced/disturbed sand and so on.

Also, it may be obvious but in case it's not, this is a DVD ROM (not a traditional DVD you can play on your tv)... which is fine, however what prevents me from giving this a 5-star rating is the apparent age of the course. My Intel Mac was a no-go... only PowerPc alas. So Apple Mac OSX 10.2 or Windows XP & 2000 only. Luckily I had an old Windows XP which I could use.

However, this course is well worth the effort. A total of 275 mins of Masterclass quality lecture by professionals.",1355011200,2,1261,4.744292237442922
