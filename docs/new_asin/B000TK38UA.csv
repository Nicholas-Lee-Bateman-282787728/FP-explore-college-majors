2905738,5,B000TK38UA,"I saw this as a kid and I never thought I would again till I looked on amazon for my primo, to my surprise, I found an bought it, it's a great film with a great message about loving and having respect for yourself, gang banging isn't all it's cracked up to be, cool and fun at first chillin' with the homies but in the end it can lead to trouble and cause pain, it's a film many can relate to as I can, the dvd looks to be a bootleg but the quality is really good, It looks the same way my old school vhs did back in the day and  to have it on dvd is pretty tight because you can't find it in any store, if you remember this movie or just want to see a good one, I recommend this one that was made by The Victory Outreach program, it is a lowbudget film so don't expect studio quality, but it's great for what is is.",1339459200,6,816,3.8

2905741,5,B000TK38UA,"This movie really touches my heart for it tells a true story of life in a gang and how people can change, turn there life around and really make something of themselves. This movie is an outstanding look of REAL life in the barrio. The actors are amatuers but play there part well... It's about 2 gangs Tokers Town and 14th Street both rival gangs Duke gang leader of Tokers Town feels the pressure of  his barrio to fight it out with rival gang 14th street. However wile Duke was in jail he made a peace treaty with the gang leader of 14th Street to find out later that it had been broken and 14th Street comes to get him and his homeboys although Duke wants out of the crime he has no choice but to declare war with 14th Street, wile his mother prays for Duke to get help on the other hand his homies getting shot up Duke can no longer take the pressure and decides to make the biggest change of his life!

THE QUALITY OF THIS DVD
This quality of this DVD is actually pretty good I watch this movie all the time it looks pretty clear but a bit dark coloring not sure if this movie is legit the real one or not cause I don't know who actally made this movie in the first place so it could be a bootleg copy i'm not sure but even if it is a bootleg the quality is pretty good so I would recamend this DVD to anyone you won't be dissapointed. This is a must have in your movie collection. It is my second favorite gangster movie next to Boulevard Nights. I hope you enjoy this as much as i do.",1261612800,7,1492,4.054237288135593
2905742,5,B000TK38UA,This movie holds a special part in my life being that my Lowrider is included in the movie and my girlfriends 2 sisters are both in it. One played the dukes girlfriend and the other played ciscos girlfriend. My Girlfriends brother in law played Cisco (dukes Brother). This film was made by the victory outreach church filmed both in San Jose and in Los angeles Ca. with most of the actors from San Jose. It is very well made and the story is pretty enlightening with a moral at the end about giving up the cholo gang life before its too late. The acting is pretty good being that most of the actors are newcommers. In Fact my girlfriends sis that played the part of the dukes girlfriend was offered more parts in hollywood after this film.,1208476800,18,739,4.401459854014599
