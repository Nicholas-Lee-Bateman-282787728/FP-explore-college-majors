1005923,5,630529285X,"All of the occupations and fields of endeavor to which Ayn Rand devoted her ideas and activities were and always have been dominated by men - and certainly not least the field of Philosophy.  It might be seen as  instructive that none of the reviews here, before this one, seem the least  bit concerned that Ayn Rand, the screenwriter, novelist, and daringly  self-appointed ""philosophress,"" was ""just a mere  woman.""  If for no other reason, that thought alone should reenforce  one's determination to see this documentary, at just about any price (under  a hundred dollars, say).",936144000,,581,5.042105263157895
1005924,5,630529285X,"A very thorough, educational and entertaining biography of Ayn Rand.  If you have never read her books, this movie will give a solid frame of reference and outline of her philosophy, ""objectivism"", which  states that personal freedom is the foundation or ""fountainhead""  from which all societal improvements flow.  If you believe in democracy and  capitalism, Rand's books are a MUST read. Watching this video was the best  2+ hours I have spent in many years.",933033600,5,460,5.066666666666666

Considering all the collectivist in our country, we need an inspiration for the indivdual.  For  the individual who gave this movie one star, I am sure you were thinking on  your own, yeah right! Oh well, you have the right to your own opinion,  thanks to people like Ayn.  This is a must see, and her books are a must  read!",925862400,3,443,4.329268292682927

The depth of information and content conveyed to the viewer is phenomenal and should not be passed over.  To  watch it is to spend a few hours living in a world where success is  possible and heroes are a way of life.  I travelled over a hundred miles  many times to see this production in the theatre and I met the director in  person after a private viewing during a convention.  All I could say to him  was, ""Thank you.""  This film is worth every penny and should be a  treasured part of anyone's video library.",918950400,5,616,4.315789473684211

News flash, to the Atlas Society - the human mind cannot fully comprehend ""infinite"".  Therefore, who is to say that God has not ALWAYS existed?  Objectivism, logical as it is, needs a closed system in which to make absolute sense.  Perhaps a ""human construct"" to explain the universe?  Lets all chase our tails, shall we!

1006003,4,630529285X,"Well, I  used to be a knee jerk fan of Ayn's.  She seemed to be a promoter of the individual, the original, and the entrepreneurial. However, she turned out to be merely a reactionary to Communism, as out of touch with her own nature as anyone, denying parts of it and consequently becoming a slave to it and its needs.  She victimized her philosophy, the admirers around her including her husband (Frank O'Connor), her young lover (Nathaniel Branden) and his wife and any fan who didn't slavishly follow her concepts. It's a sad tale, to quote Shakespeare. But, does it signify nothing?  Only time will tell. This DVD is a respectable addition to the wealth of material available on Ayn.  But to get a full perspective one must read biographies on her written by Nathaniel Branden, Barbara Branden, and especially Jennifer Burns' ""Goddess of the Market."" Ayn's a great writer. Her fiction is superb. However, when she wandered out of her depth into economics, politics, philosophy and psychology, she was not the genius she believed she was.",1420070400,3,1042,4.864406779661017

1006010,5,630529285X,"Ayn Rand changed, if not saved, my life and mind.  For those of you who are not familiar with her, this is a great capsule summary of her life and values.  Wonderfully written, directed, and produced by Michael Paxton, the documentary covers the span of her life as expressed in her writings and interviews, and through the experiences of those who met or knew her best.  The narration by Sharon Gless is emotive and draws viewers into the story.  I've seen the film many times.  In retrospect, I cannot think of another actor who could have done it more effectively--much in the same way that no other actor could have narrated ""The Shawshank Redemption"" better than Morgan Freeman.  For those of you have read her works, you won't learn anything new about her ideas.  But, as one who never knew her, I concluded watching the film feeling as if I did.  It is my hope that those of you who choose to make a purchase will conclude your viewing with understanding her sense of life, if not a finding a greater  appreciation of this incredible, yet controversial individual.",1403395200,,1071,4.654255319148936

Going to at least see the movie ""Fountainhead"" (it was made into a movie wasn't it?)  Ayn's story was so far beyond pretty much all of our life experiences.

But I do appreciate her more as an honest and intelligent person. I was not swayed by her case for Individualism and Objectivism but have a greater appreciation for her point of view and can understand why she came to her philosophy based on her biography. I believe the documentary would have been more enjoyable for me had it been more balance by giving more time to opposing points of view.

1006098,5,630529285X,"I have seen most of the footage of this documentary in many shorter commentaries and biographies; and as extras on DVD`s of her films. It is the mostly chronological and few soundbite presentation that has an almost movie like feel.

Aside from the purpose of the presentation I really enjoyed seeing clips of a lot of my favorite movies. Most are in my collection.

Ayn Rand as a writer is quite amatureish in my opinion . I also think the dvds are B grade and thoroughly boring. If this is supposed to be individulism and the way to live ones life why could she not write a satisfactoury ending instead of a science fiction other worldly  non ending to her tome?  The cult of Ayn Rand is a better description of her ideas and quite dangerous ones in the wrong hands . Self interest can be easily misunderstood . The religious texts do the same thing in the wrong hands. All of us should do the best we can given our individual gifts and be able to form relationships with many different peoples.

That quote is emblematic of this film, which stands as a definition and epitome of the word ""paean"". There is never the slightest attempt at even-handedness or balance. In the opinion of this film, no one can simply disagree with Rand, criticize her writing or dispute her philosophy. Her critics (none of them ever named or quoted) can only ""viciously attempt [the word 'attempt' helpfully bringing our attention to their inevitable failure] to discredit her."" There's a lot of interesting information in this documentary, and I give it 2 stars for that. But it was clearly produced by the most breathless and fawning of admirers of Rand; a fanatical fan in whose eyes the Great Woman can have no flaws, and with whom no rational person could ever conceivably disagree.

Ayn Rand was a profound thinker and remains an important figure in contemporary philosophy. She deserves to have her life and work documented in a serious film. This childish piece of breathless, dewy-eyed hero-worship is infinitely far from being that film.",1325462400,9,1121,5.059459459459459

1006177,5,630529285X,"I like biographical films; indeed I like biographies in general and they take up a large portion of my adult reading life.  I am presently reading to biographies on the life and work of Ayn Rand and this particular film fit perfectly with my personal agenda.

Now to begin with, this review is not going to be an endless rant or series of pontifications either for or against this lady, her writing or her philosophy.  I have close friends who are quite bright and well educated who are absolute Rand fanatics.  I have close friends who are quite bright and well educated who absolutely despise Rand, her writings and everything she stands for.  I have, over the years, read her works and I am the type of person who likes to do his own reading and make up my own mind and I pretty well completely ignore the rants of others.

When watching this rather well made biography the viewer should probably know that it is quite sympathetic to Rand and her work.  If they do not know this fact, it will not take long to figure it out.  This was fine by me as I was not expecting an ""authorized"" film to be anything less than sympathetic. I do feel the film addressed the different aspects of her philosophy quite well in a style and language that most can easily understand. Weather or not they accept her teachings....well, that is up to the individual.

No, my reasons for watching this film was strictly due to the fact that I find Ayn Rand to be a most fascinating individual who led a most interesting life.  Now in her case I realize that it is almost impossible to separate the individual as a human being from the individual as a writer and philosopher; they go hand in hand.  Still and all though, I feel efforts to do so in my case was the best attitude and methodology.  In many ways Rand is a poster girl for the American Dream.  Escaping Bolshevik Russia, she made her way to this country with extremely limited recourses, spoke almost no English and was Jewish.  Despite all of this...she was undeniably successful.

This film traces Rand's life from the beginning as the daughter of a middle class Jewish family in prerevolutionary Russia through her entire career as a writer and a philosophic power.  This woman saw a lot in her life.  She was undoubtedly a brilliant individual and was one of those people whose personality was so forceful and an individual who was so driven toward her goals, that she was bound to the a success at what ever she did.

Other reviewers have compared this particular biographical film to the work of Ken Burns. I would have to agree with this as the quality and the overall feeling and impact is most certainly present.  The young lady that narrates the film was a perfect fit for the part.  The film consists of a tremendous amount of old film footage and black and white photographs and some of these films are absolutely priceless...I thought they were truly the highlight of the entire film and of course were one of the primary reasons for my watching this work.

As you watch this film, weather or not you agree or disagree with Rand, consider this.  In surveys it has been found that other than the Bible, people overwhelmingly state that Rand's two major works have influenced their lives more than anything they have ever read.  Her books still sell hundreds and thousands of copies each year.  There is (I know that many will deny this, but it is fact) a group of very bright individuals who have raised this author and her work to an almost cult type of figure.  Her writings have influenced at least four generations of people.  Her works are taught in high schools and colleges all over the country. Folks, this author's work, for better or for worse...depending on how you feel about it, has had a major impact on our society.  Anyone that has that kind of power deserves to be studied.

As I said...Rand is was and is a fascinating individual.  I did like this film.

I learned what kind of family she came from and what they did, how her parents influenced her, what events happened in Russia as she grew up, and how she and her family reacted to them.
She loved American movies, and when she arrived in the USA, she made her way to Hollywood, taking any job to support herself in her first goal of becoming a screenwriter. Being accepted as a novelist was also slow for many years. But she did not compromise her values. You may not agree with her beliefs, but you have to admire her honesty.

She saw communism and its creed of mass identity even as she formulated her own philosophy based on individualism. Her family knew that she would not survive long under the commissars and arranged for her to go to America. This is where she began life with a new country and a new name.

Ayn Rand's life is fascinating. She worked in Hollywood, met her ideal of a husband and became a novelist and a well-known philosopher. In the 1930s, when so many were falling under the impression that fascism and communism were the wave of the future she stood by individualism as the heart of societal and cultural potential. This film follows her life as she became successful novelist and a great debater, despite having to learn English as a second language.

1006212,5,630529285X,"I've been an admirer of Ayn Rand since reading her classic `Atlas Shrugged' some thirty plus years ago but unfortunately I'd never really taken the time to further explore her other literary works, life, or the philosophy of objectivism. Now in retrospect I feel I've cheated myself by delaying this exploration into an extremely profound individual and her extraordinary school of thought.

Finally I have taken an important step in rectifying the situation by viewing the incredible 1998 documentary `Ayn Rand - A Sense of Life'. The film captivated me from the beginning and my interest never waned for a single moment until its all to soon to arrive end. That in itself is quite a feat. Just think about it for a moment, a 143 minute documentary film dealing with the life and times of a 20th century philosopher that holds your attention as firmly as any big budget Hollywood extravaganza. Honestly, I couldn't tear myself away for a moment.

What an unbelievable life she lived; escaping a tumultuous Russia during the rise of the Communist regime, turning a chance meeting with the legendary Cecil B DeMille into a bit part in the silent film classic `King of Kings' and forming a relationship with him that would eventually land her a lucrative position as a screenplay writer . And that was just the beginning of a productive career that most of us could only dream of.  If anyone had a true ""sense of life"" it was surely Ayn Rand.

Aside from being a documentary about such a relevant, larger than life personality, the film also excels in virtually every imaginable category; stylistic approach, production values, soundtrack, editing, and a multitude of other levels that I simply can't think of at the moment.

If indeed there was anything one could be critical about concerning `Ayn Rand - A Sense of Life' it would be that it was obviously a production made as a tribute and memorial to Rand by those who loved her and hope to promote her legacy for future generations. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that but a little more exploration into some of the more questionable aspects of her life could have added further depth and thought into an already exemplary cinematic portrayal.

1006214,4,630529285X,"The memorable, and ultimately appalling, thing about Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life,the new film biography of the right-wing novelist-philosopher, is that it is perfectly true to its subject. Just as Rand, who was born in 1905 in Leningrad as it was convulsed by revolution, declared that she had not changed her ideas about anything since the age of 2, this reverential documentary presents her thoughts as uncontested truth.

The evangelical tone is set by filmmaker Michael Paxton, quoted in the press material as saying that he first found Ayn Rand when he was an adolescent trying ""to find a book that would answer all of my questions and give my life meaning."" A Sense of Life contents itself with interviewing her friends and acolytes. It acknowledges that she was much criticized, and even considered a crank, but her critics don't appear onscreen and their views are not explained.

But neither Rand nor the film should be dismissed, if only because she is widely read and her ideas have been deeply influential. They lie behind much neo-conservative commentary, which recasts democracy -- essentially an untidy contest of ideas and interests -- as a secular religion (she called it Objectivism) where competing points of view are greeted with adolescent impatience.

But more particularly, Rand's influence helps explain the concealed romanticism of much right-wing commentary, which replaces iconic figures from other belief systems with buccaneering businessmen and entrepreneurs. As this film unwittingly makes clear, Rand herself was one of the great romantics. A worshipper of Hollywood, and partly successful screenwriter, she laments that the film version of her novel The Fountainhead ""lacked the Romanticism of the German films she had loved as a youth."" That these films were the precursors of fascism seems to have escaped the notice of Rand and her disciples.

This appealing simplicity, a charming oblivion to her own contradictions, gave Rand a widespread following among those looking for answers, even as it exasperated intellectuals. She believed that each individual has a sacred core of personal talents and dreams which can be expressed in a free society. People may choose to co-operate, but these choices must ultimately serve their self-interest. If an action is truly selfless, she often said, it is ""evil."" Her reasoning was that selflessness in one's own life can be enlisted by political systems such as communism that call on human beings to sacrifice themselves for the state.

These views were apparently burned into Rand's consciousness by the horrors she witnessed during and after the Russian Revolution -- a period the film recalls through family photographs and archival film footage. She decided that capitalism was the only hope for mankind. ""Capitalism leaves every man free to choose the work he likes,"" she declares onscreen, oblivious to the deadening monotony of most people's jobs, not to mention unemployment.

Like her spiritual successors she prefers the grand and distant vista, and does not approach closely to see the outcasts and victims who are part of every great undertaking. She loved ""the view of the skyscrapers where you don't see the details,"" declares the film, unselfconsciously.

This made her a formidable popular writer. She was seriously able to declare that Marilyn Monroe seemed to have come from an ideal, joyful world, that the star was ""someone untouched by suffering."" The hero of her last novel, Atlas Shrugged,was the direct descendant of Cyrus, the hero of a boy's adventure story she read at the age of 16. Like most libertarians, she had a deeply childish world view.

Never beautiful, Rand's intensity (and searching black eyes) seduced more than a few men. According to Harry Binswager, one of her academic admirers, ""her idea of feminity was an admiration of masculine qualities."" This was also Hitler's idea of feminity, and Rand's screenplays invariably include an idealized hero or heroine standing on a distant promontory, Leni Riefenstahl-style, but these fascinating parallels are of course not examined in A Sense of Life.

Rand had a powerful, if not searching, intellect. In many onscreen interviews seen in the film, she gives apparently convincing answers to her critics. But the answers are always framed in absolutes -- ""man wants freedom, suffering has no importance"" -- which are essentially empty postulates. But they have an attractive ring.

A Sense of Life is worth seeing because its naive presentation of Rand is consonant with Rand herself. In fact, it feels like nothing so much as an in-house biography of the founder of some fundamentalist religious sect. It acknowledges its subject's imperfections (her infidelity to her husband of 50 years, for example), but only to declare them redeemed by her quest for truth.

Rand was, of course, a lifelong atheist. But her work is a testament to the yearning for belief. The film concludes on a lingering shot of a poster for Atlas Shrugged,""Don't call it hero worship: it's a kind of white heat where philosophy becomes religion.""

Or, perhaps, the ashes that are left when you turn up the temperature on a new belief system to the point where human community and compassion are burnt away. Conrad Alton, Filmbay Editor.",1216598400,6,5272,5.174882629107981

1006216,5,630529285X,"Ayn Rand wrote some of my favorite books: The Fountain Head and Atlas Shrugged.

Born at the beginning of the 20th Century Russia, in the beautiful city of St. Petersburg, Ayn Rand started to read from the early age of six. By the age of nine, it is said that she knew she wanted to dedicate her life to writing and to philosophy.

Russia of the times was focused in collectivism, something Ayn Rand despised. After reading the works of Victor Hugo her character starts to shape. She lived through the Kerensky Revolution and in 1917, through the Bolshevik Revolution. From the start, she denounced communism and when the revolutionaries are victorious and start the painstaking process of taking away property, confiscating the pharmacy her father owned, she decides Russia is not the country for her. The family undergoes poverty and lack of food. While at school, during a class of American History, Ayn develops the ardent desire to become an American citizen. The United States becomes her goal because she wants to join a nation of free men and women, where the rights of the individual are protected by its constitution.

The university where she was studying philosophy is overtaken by communists, but during her last years of study; she enjoys one great pleasure, watching Western films and plays, and decides to enter the State Institute for Cinema Arts to study screenwriting.

Finally, she is permitted to leave Soviet Russia and to visit the United States. Her trip was supposed to last a short time, but she was determined never to return to Russia. New York City, with its skyscrapers, thousand lights, and never ending activity becomes the city that shapes her interpretation of the finest achievements of humanity. For a while, following her acting career, she travels to Hollywood and meets Cecil B. DeMille, who offers this striking young woman, with piercing eyes, a ride to the set of his movie The King of Kings. Mr. DeMille gives her an opportunity, her first job in the USA, as an extra, a script reader.

She meets actor Frank O'Connor and they strike interesting conversations that result in a marriage until death did they part. She writes The Fountainhead, where she shapes a hero by the name of Howard Roark, an architect, an ideal man that reveals to the world a philosopher that clearly sees how ""a man ought to be."" She then moves to write Atlas Shrugged, a novel that shares her philosophy through a story, surfacing the concept of objectivism, or how to live on Planet Earth.

The beauty of this DVD is that you see rare interviews with this marvelous philosopher who believed that only through a free capitalistic economic system and process could humans express and reach their full potential. For us, it provided a rare view into a favorite writer and we thoroughly enjoyed learning that as her characters, she refused to compromise and demanded that the entire speech given by her character, Howard Roark, played by Gary Copper, be delivered in entirety in the production of The Fountain Head. Without a doubt, if you admire Ayn Rand's work, this is a DVD that opens the door to rare film where we can see the episodes of the life of an amazing woman, writer, and philosopher.",1207008000,5,3214,4.823956442831216

Particularly disappointing is the documentary's slighting of Nathaniel and Barbara Branden, who played an enormous role in Rand's life from 1950-1968 and were largely responsible for the launch of the Objectivist movement.  Nathaniel, of course, had an affair with Rand, with the consent of their spouses.  Leonard Peikoff (who didn't learn about the affair until years later) blames Rand's split with the Brandens on Nathaniel's supposed failings.  Of course, there is every reason to think the split was a bit more complicated than this.  Unfortunately, Peikoff (mistakenly called Rand's ""intellectual heir"") even speculates that the affair did not hurt Rand's husband Frank O'Connor when the evidence is to the contrary.

Paxton did, however, have access to Rand's archives and the documentary contains plenty of interesting pictures and video of Rand.  Even those who know a fair amount about Rand's life will learn a lot.",1195171200,13,1176,5.28494623655914

1006221,3,630529285X,"A documentary about Ayn Rand should be interesting to watch whether you agree with all or some of her philosophy or not. The problem with ""Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life"" is that it is a tribute to her rather than a biography. It does tell the story of her life, but it does it in a way that seems aimed at her fans and followers rather than to the general public. The film seems to preach what a perfect person Rand was, and imply that those who criticize her are ignorant. Everything about Russia is bad, everything about America is good (are there no other countries in the world, by the way?). This oversimplified worldview - as well as the film's tendencies to get sentimental - hurts the credibility of the movie.

The running time is almost two and a half hours and it should have been shorter. Early on in the movie, there's a sequence of footage from silent films that Rand liked to watch as a child, and later there are some details that are just not very interesting, such as the one that she had to move because she had a cat, and that she was excited to get the chance to drive a train when researching a book. If some of these things were taken out the film would have been better paced. Although it's fun to see talk show footage of Rand, it can get a bit repetitive.

Overall, this film is somewhat interesting to watch if you take it for what it is - a tribute made by her fans. A film on this subject could have been much better though.",1150329600,21,1449,4.2086330935251794
1006247,4,630529285X,"I've been interested in Ayn Rand ever since I read ""Atlas Shrugged"" when I was only 22 years old. I didn't quite get everything Ayn was trying to say in that book at the time, and I chalked it up to my lack of life experience given my youth. When I was 40, I ran across this documentary on public TV. I figured that since 18 years had passed, watching this documentary combined with my maturity would enable me to understand Ayn Rand.
This biography is a very sanitized version of Ayn Rand's life. The biography is accurate if not complete, since there is a lack of balance in the presentation due to the absence of information that shows the flawed and even somewhat ""kookie"" facets of the woman. For example, she encouraged her followers to smoke to highlight mankind's dominance over fire. The film also makes out her relationship with her husband, Frank, to be an ideal romance that lasted for decades. In fact, Ayn cheated on Frank for years with colleague Nathaniel Branden. To give her credit, she was true to her philosophy in being ""objective"" about the affair in the sense that she insisted that both her and Branden's spouse know what was going on. She ceased being objective, though, when Branden tired of her and began having an affair with a younger woman. She threw Branden and his research out the door with all of the emotion of any human being whose heart was being ""subjectively"" stomped on. I bring these points up not for the purpose of character assassination. Instead, I think that that it is difficult to get a balanced view of someone whose life work was pronouncing how life should be lived without examining the both the flaws and triumphs in that person's own life.
The documentary did give me some insight into Ayn Rand's philosophy, though, and I'll have to say that she seems to be someone who threw the baby out with the bath water at every turn. As a youth in Russia, prior to the Russian revolution, she saw the failure of the Russian orthodox church to connect with the parishioners and help their lives in any way. This caused her to become an atheist without causing her to explore if it was in fact that this particular institution of religion  was the failure, rather than the concept of God. After the revolution she saw the utter failure of the policies of Communism, and this caused her to believe that pure unadulterated capitalism is the only economic system that works, not bothering to realize that there might be a third way that looks out for society's weaker members while also rewarding enterprise and hard work.
The fact that Ayn was what is an ""odd bird"" in 21st century America - an atheist capitalist - can only make me wonder what she would have to say about today's situation of fundamentalist Christian dogma intertwined with cut-throat capitalism that has become today's Republican party. I can't imagine she'd have anything good to say about it, and on that we would be in agreement.
Thus, if you are interested in learning the main points about Ayn Rand's life, this is a good source for the facts and even some insights - particularly good are the clips from her appearances on the Donahue show shortly before her death. However, realize that this biography is somewhat sanitized.",1146787200,18,3241,4.666083916083916
1006248,4,630529285X,"Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life is a positive look at the life of author-philosopher Ayn Rand and was obviously lovingly made by people who have read her novels and were part of her inner circle of friends. No matter where you find yourself in the political spectrum, Ayn Rand's viewpoints have probably touched you, directly or indirectly, through the power of her ideas and her philosophy of Objectivism, which has gained a firm foothold among libertarians and individualists. Objectivists are now fairly easy to find anywhere you go.

This movie is of interest to anyone who has explored one of her novels. If you have an interest in collectivism and how it can shape people, this is also a good movie to watch. Rand's life was full of highs and lows, personal tragedies and lofty achievements. It is worth examining. A Sense of Life is a positive portrait of her as a human being, and glosses over her personal flaws. And that is OK with me, because from my perspective, Ayn's life had a far more positive impact on humanity as a whole than her personal flaws had a negative impact on her inner circle.

Lives ripple outward, and Ayn Rand's body of work has touched millions of people. Whether you agree or disagree with her worldview, A Sense of Life celebrates Rand and her important ideas. If you've made it through Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead, and found anything in them that left you spellbound or wide eyed, then this biography will likely hold your interest.

Ayn Rand's work focused on an all but lost artistic tradition known as ""Romanticism"". Romanticism focuses on the best of us, not our flaws. To that extent, this documentary is true to her ideals. It leaves out what was bad about her and focuses on the good. It tells of how she came to America with 8 dollars in her pocket and went on to become one of the most successful writers of the twentieth century. ""What was her serious crime"" you ask? She was a woman living in the 1950's who spoke her mind and had an affair with a younger man. This film doesn't go into the last part in much detail. If that makes it biased, then so be it.

Objectivism is/was not a dogma. It has been labeled as such, but those who would apply that description to it obviously don't understand it. Objectivism requires that each individual use ""objective"" reality to come up with their own views. I am capable of admiring Ayn Rand, considering myself an Objectivist, and disagree with her on numerous issues. A cult where everyone gets to make up their own mind is a contradiction in terms.

Also shown are excerpts from Ayn's television appearances, most notably two interviews with Phil Donohue, who seemed to adore her.

The obvious bias of the film and the reverent worshipful tones of narrator Sharon Gless are a little too much treacle to swallow without question - something Leonard Peikoff and her other acolytes seem to do wholeheartedly. The whole debacle with Nathaniel Branden was glossed over, with Ayn portrayed as a victim, not the immature virago her writings make her seem.

Frankly, I felt a little queasy watching this because Ms. Rand's books and philosophy made such an impact on me as a teen. (Ms. Rand's philosophies are perfect for teenagers, for whom everything is black-and-white, all-or-nothing.)

The treatment Nathaniel Branden receives is terribly unfair, and Ayn Rand's culpability in the whole affair is reduced to victemhood (not a likely proposition given Ayn's strong character).  There is little if any hint at all of her dislike for most of the adherents to her philosophy and their sheep-like adoration.

It's clear that Piekoff and the rest of the Objectivist gurus had a strong hand in this documentary's production and content.  It is certainly a whitewash of her excesses and the execesses of objectivist organizations that sprang up in support of her ideals.

Much like Rand's books, which can be read and re-read, always finding more to think about, this documentary can be repeatedly viewed, and one will always find something missed and something more to learn, because it is so packed with information and extraordinary footage.

The still photographs and archival film footage is astonishing in its quantity and quality, and as explained by filmmaker Michael Paxton in the 2nd Disc interview, were painstakingly chosen and added to the film; it is an endless collage of her life, narrated with extreme skill by Sharon Gless, whose pleasing voice is perfect for this long (143 minute) film.

Those of us fortunate enough to have seen this world-premiere play in Los Angeles fifteen years ago, remember hearing the splendor of Ayn Rand's words spoken by first-rate actors under Paxton's masterful direction. Those who did not see the play, have a very special treat awaiting them. But even for those who previously saw the play, the filmed version offers an additional level of enjoyment, because we get to see the action close up from the perspective chosen by the director.  This adds another level of emphasis and meaning to the film. This part of the bonus DVD is a treasure.

Any fan of Ayn Rand will be delighted with this new Collector's Edition of Michael Paxton's ""Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life.""",1097539200,16,1937,4.836858006042296
1006256,4,630529285X,"While an undergraduate student in the 70's, I discovered the works of Ayn Rand.  As a professor of humanities and philosophy I have used her works in classrooms, where students are introduced to the enigma of Rand's philosophy.
Rand was a better novelist than she ever was a philosopher and the contradictions in her philosophy become obvious upon semi-serious reflection.
Yet, this is not to detract from her absolute popularity even to the present day.  The DVD ""A Sense Of Life"" is a wonderful glimpse into the life of one of the 20th century's great idealists.  Though eliminating some critical elements of her life that genuinely contradicted her philosophical views, the film does a fair job of sharing the story of her life in the big picture.
In the absense of reading her works, the film will have less impact that it could.  There is little real analysis of her works in the film and the glossing over does not do her justice.
But, in all fairness, the film is a biographical film, not a critique of her literature.  And in the sense of a biographical film it is a fair and acurate protrayal.
Though many philosophers have disagreed with her work, (one of my undergraduate phil. profs once said of her work: ""If I were ever going to use Ayn Rand's books in my class, it would be a class on 'Rabid Subjectivism'""...an opinion I strongly disagree with.
I respected Ayn Rand, both as a novelist and as a thinker who tried very hard to formulate her ideas in an age that downplayed reason and critical thinking...such that Bertrand Russell was refused a teaching position in New York because of his philosophical opinions. Even Russell had his philosophical difficulties.
The film captures important scenes from Rand's interviews, though I never understood why Phil Donahue would interview Ayn Rand, as I don't consider him a critical thinker at all...But that is what we are offered.
In conclusion, the film is well worth the money and time to watch it...you may even be inclined to actually read some of her books.",1074211200,7,2022,4.765714285714286

The story of Rand is enticing, even to those who do not like her.  The story was extremely well-written and the selection and handling of material was well done.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the variety of materials which had been assembled for this Academy Award nominated documentary.
After meeting the director, Michael Paxton, in person, I can see why he achieved such a great film.  He is as amazing a person as the film itself is on the screen.
Sitting to watch this film over and over with friends and family is an excellent use of one's time-- and time which will be enjoyed.  I highly recommend this DVD to be part of any serious movie collection.
I have the framed, preserved, autographed movie poster for this DVD hanging in my office behind my desk as the focal point of the room-- that's how much I love this film.",1073606400,4,948,4.552941176470588

The interviews with Ayn and her discussing her philosophy of objectivism, are priceless.  What a wonderful way to learn about her. Also the story has so many scenes of old New York that are so exciting. All I can say is if you want to know about Ms Rand, buy this DVD. You will not be sorry.

1006281,5,630529285X,"It's just as well that this terrific documentary did not win the Academy Award, since that same Oscar for documentary film later was awarded to ""Bowling for Columbine"" -- a staged work of satire whose shams and errors substantively disqualified it from ""documentary"" status (but rules don't really matter in Hollywood).  The award has thus been cheapened, and ""A Sense of Life"" is in a much higher class.
All of the people who consume more than they produce (in other words, thieves) will not like the story of Rand's life, in that they are properly cast as society's villains.  However, everyone who produces, champions individualism and promotes self-reliance, will find this fine (and genuine) documentary inspirational.",1059436800,11,723,5.224137931034483
1006282,4,630529285X,"This is an entertaining and very thorough, though one-sided, look at the life of Ayn Rand, one of the most controversial philosophers of recent times. The fact that many in academia would not deign to call her a ""philosopher"" at all is due more to ideological bias and her uncompromising nature than to any defect in her thinking or writing. Ayn Rand was a Russian immigrant who loved the idea of America from an early age. In America, and in New York City in particular, she saw the highest culmination of man's achievement. In her view, only a completely free capitalist economic system allows human beings to express their true nature and reach their full potential. This philosophy was later adapted by the modern libertarian movement (which Rand herself quickly disassociated herself from for various personal and ideological reasons). This documentary does a very good job at showing Rand's life in a way she herself would have appreciated (she died some twenty years before the film was made). This, of course, can be considered a defect. There is scarcely one dissenting voice in the film, with the exception of Phil Donahue, who interviewed Rand several times. Leonard Peikoff, called Ayn Rand's ""intellectual heir,"" does not seem to disagree one iota with anything his teacher ever said. The paradox about Ayn Rand and the movement she started, called Objectivism, is that despite its strict adherence to reason and individualism, it had some definite cultlike characteristics. Followers imitated Rand down to the smallest mannerism; for example, it was virtually mandatory to smoke cigarettes as Rand considered this a powerful symbol of man conquering fire (this detail is not in the film). Rand's dogmatism inevitably comes through in the film, but it is mainly presented as the virtue of one who refuses to comprise, like Howard Roark, John Galt and the other heroes of her novels. There was definitely a less noble aspect to her personality, which is not dealt with in the documentary. Her affair with Nathaniel Branden is briefly, and rather clumsily alluded to. Nathaniel Branden, his wife Barbara (both who have written books about Ayn Rand) had a complex relationship with Ayn Rand (and her husband Frank O'Connor, who seems to have mainly taken a back seat in the events of her life). The film implies that the unpleasant ending of Rand's relationship with Branden was due to some shortcoming on his part. There are, of course, other versions of this story. One fact, again not mentioned in the film, is that Rand and her closest followers denounced Branden (who is himself the author of several influential books on psychology) very viciously, treating him very much like someone who has abandoned a cult. It may very well be, however, that Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life is a better film for focusing on the positive traits of its subject's life. After all, many brilliant artists and intellectuals have been difficult personalities in their everyday lives. Ayn Rand's arrogance, dogmatism and intolerance of dissent does not explain or justify the contempt with which she has been treated by the mainstream media and academic establishment. It seems that she was a spokesperson for an idea that will never be intellectually respectable -that the individual, not God, society or the state is of primary importance. I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested in the life of this extraordinary woman. Those not familiar with her may want to read her novels, especially The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged first.",1058486400,126,3538,5.039249146757679
1006283,5,630529285X,"This was an incredible film of a remarkable woman.  In particular, the film does a great job of showing more of the person behind the persona.  It shows how she consistently applied her principles and how they furthered her life and gave her happiness.",1056758400,3,252,4.704545454545454
1006284,3,630529285X,"Ayn Rand once said something to the effect of, ""As much as I hate to admit it, I share something with Karl Marx.  He once said, 'Save me from the Marxists!'  Sometimes I feel like saying 'Save me from the Randians!'""
This movie was a reverential treatment of Rand by people who loved her, and there's certainly nothing wrong with that.  However, I almost flipped as I watched several of them explain that Ayn dissociated from Nathaniel Branden because of ""severe philosophical errors.""  This ""philosophical error"" was to end the 25-year affair that Rand orchestrated and to start dating a younger woman who was Ayn's intellectual inferior.  At one time, Branden was revered as a near-god by the same people who denounced him in this film.  One word from Ayn, and they all changed their tunes as if they'd never sung his praises in the first place.
Ayn once said that there was no danger of Objectivism becoming a cult, because since it championed reason and logic, its adherents would always arrive to proper conclusions through their own volition.  True enough in theory, but in practice, Objectivists have simply adopted Rand's writings as a standard for truth, logic or reality notwithstanding.  (They even adopt her signature punctuation error!)  I admire Rand too, and I don't mean to denegrate or ridicule, but I think that modern Objectivism could use an overhaul and incorporate a little free thinking.
If Ayn were here today, I believe she would still be saying, ""Save me from the Randians!""",1053475200,19,1500,4.897233201581027
1006285,2,630529285X,"""A Sense of Life"" is a hagiography of Ayn Rand made by and for her admirers. To those who haven't drunk the Randian kool-aid (or did so when they were teenagers and have since felt the effects wear off) it will seem thin and simplistic. This is forgivable. Rand was an ideologue, so you expect a certain amount of simple-mindedness to trail in her wake, just as you'd expect, say, a documentary about the Berkley Free Speech Movement to have a naively rosy view of 1960s idealism. What's unforgivable is how dull ""A Sense of Life"" is.
Clocking in at over two and a half hours, Paxton's movie is a slow crawl through Rand's biography. It consists mostly of narration over archival footage, interspersed with clips from admiring academics and sound bites from Rand's TV appearances, primarily a ""Donahue"" segment shot in 1980. The first of these is the worst. Narrator Sharon Gless's voice strikes a patronizing note of indignation whenever she describes something that Rand would have disapproved of, like editorial intrusiveness or the rise of the Bolsheviks. The academics are inoffensive, but since it's not exactly hard to get the gist of Rand's philosophy, also superfluous. Most prominent among them is professional acolyte Leonard Peikoff, who is billed in a subtitle as ""Rand's intellectual heir,"" and it's fun to think about the cachet this toadying designation must have in certain bow-tied circles. It's also fun to note how, in a movie full of self-satisfied ideologues, Phil Donahue still comes off more fatuous than anyone else. But these are small delights. Overall, the pace of ""Sense of Life"" is slow and the details are numbing. When Paxton informs you that Rand and her husband had to move out of one of their apartments because the landlord didn't allow pets, you get the sense that the script could have stood a little tightening up.
This is particularly a shame because Rand's life is fascinating, a classic immigrant's story full of high drama and historical sweep. Born in St. Petersburg in 1905, the young Rand experienced firsthand the misery of life in the early years of the Soviet Union. She came to the U.S. in the mid-1920s and made her way to L.A. While wandering around the Universal lot she caught the eye of Cecile B. De Mille, who cast her as an extra, a break that began her climb up the Hollywood ladder. That a key moment in Ayn Rand's life would seem to have been lifted straight out of a 1930s musical is entirely appropriate. Unlike native-born authors like Dorothy Parker or William Faulkner, who made literary names for themselves before they went slumming in Hollywood, Rand's first ambition was to be a screenwriter; the novels came later. There's a winning originality and lack of pretension in this career path. Ayn Rand claimed that she was born in Russia by mistake, and ""A Sense of Life"" is best when it explores Rand's American-ness: her ambition, her practicality, her love of tough guys and neon lit streets, and her unabashed embrace of Hollywood. Though Rand's enduring image is that of an imperious European intellectual, her rise was a quintessential American success story. The lady had moxie.
But so did a lot of people back in the golden age of Hollywood, and when you look back on it, the work they produced was pretty corny too. ""A Sense of Life"" contains clips from an 1942 Italian adaptation of Rand's anti-Soviet novel ""We the Living"", and if you weren't paying attention you might think it was pro-Soviet propaganda, because the dialog is stiff and preachy in a way that is reminiscent of nothing so much as Socialist Realism. The tragedy of Ayn Rand is not that the quality of her work was outstripped by her personal charisma.  (Which, judging from the interview clips, was considerable: imagine a prickly Russian Oprah).  It's the way she attracted followers who adopted her black and white worldview but replaced her cranky iconoclasm with limp hero worship. (You can't help wondering how many of Rand's fawning admirers, had they been born in St. Petersburg in 1905, would have ended up penning odes to Lenin.) Limp hero worship is ultimately all this movie can manage. Ayn Rand wrote novels that were bloated and preachy but still weirdly compelling. All Michael Paxton can manage is two out of three.",1047772800,33,4273,4.852054794520548
1006286,5,630529285X,"Watching this exhaustive documentary (2:23) was a real eye opener for me. While I am conversant with her works, I was quite ignorant of the details of her life. The documentary follows Ayn from her oppressed Russian beginnings to (believe it or not) the pasteboard sets of 30s Hollywood to the intellectual circles of New York. The contrast are amazing and one can't but conclude that Any Rand lived a very fortunate life.
The commentaries are not very insightful - but only due to the exceptionally detailed information narrated by Sharon Gless. Strangely enough, one of the more dramatic events of her career; her affair with Nathaniel Branden, is glossed of in less than 15 seconds. So I recommend seeing ""The Passion of Ayn Rand"" for more on that story. A word to the wise: if you buy both this DVD and ""The Passion of Ayn Rand"", I suggest watching this one first. It will give you a more complete understanding of her background.",1034553600,3,934,4.701219512195122
1006287,5,630529285X,"Sharon Gless's narration for this video was a bit too sugary for my sensitive United Kingdom ears. That aside, I thought the programme was interesting and well organised, with the strange omission of anything to do with her funeral and subsequent burial alongside her beloved Frank. Frank is given quite a lot of screen time to flesh out his background - barely covered in any other material that I have seen - and comes across in a much more favourable light than usual, with his promotion from simple flower arranger to commercial horticulturalist :-) I get the impression that the Big-Brains who have written articles about Ayn Rand resented the fact that Ayn loved Frank.

The contrast between Ayn Rand relaxing in her Californian, Neutra designed house, and the images of the Russia she left behind, less than 20 years earlier, was somewhat dramatic: such a style of living only attainable by those in the higher echelons of government, and not at all possible for an ordinary person, as she was in the US. This was further amplified by: her testimony at the Senate hearings where she pointed out that unless one had lived under a regime such as she had emigrated from, her testimony would seem to be rather fantastical to an average American, etc; her private train carriage - like Dagny Taggart's - for her final, New Orleans lecture trip; and how her sister, Nora - a set designer in Russia - had fared.

The interviews with Leonard Peikoff were good to watch, as were those of others who knew her.

Unfortunately this video is a US release only, in the NTSC format. This isn't a problem for playback in the UK, since most VCRs, nowadays, will play both PAL and NTSC. But shelling out another ($$$) for import duty is a bit of a bummer.",1030579200,6,1744,4.6558441558441555

Then along comes ""Sense Of Life"", which explains it all.
Remember, Pro-Rand are happy to espouse her benevolent Super-Man theories, and Anti-Rand relish calling her fascist.  Ironically neither are really true.

I always thought her writing was juvenile (an ancestor of todays TV Soaps), and her politics naive.  I had no idea how right I was.

1006323,3,630529285X,"The three stars that I gave this DVD, a gift from a special friend, an ardent student of Miss Rand and Objectivism, does not mean that I did not enjoy this documentary tremendously.  I am not the most ardent fan of Miss Rand although I greatly admire the one book of hers that I read, ""The Fountainhead,"" for its astounding literary merits.  I have started reading ""Atlas Shrugged,"" considered her masterpiece, even better than ""The Fountainhead.""  Indeed, I am vaguely uneasy about the ""cult"" of personality that developed around her, and because the documentary did not address this issue, which has fascinated me, I am giving the documentary three stars only--the HBO movie with Helen Mirren, ""The Passions of Ayn Rand"" was more revealing about her followers, the impact of Objectivism on its followers, and how inter-connected Rand became with some of her admirers.  In other words, I do not know that much more about Miss Rand because of this documentary, but I did enjoy watching it first because it was given to me by a dear friend who admires Miss Rand, and secondly because I realized how strong one person's will can be as Rand's will was so strong that it propelled her out of one world so vastly different from the one that she ended up in.  Of course I am talking about Russia as her original world and America as her new world.  However, I vaguely felt that there were many pieces about her life like the Center for the Advancement of Objectivism (and any impact it may have had on today's intelligensia), which should have been addressed in the documentary.  I would also have liked the documentary to reveal more about her notorious and later bitter relationship with Nathaniel Branden, with whom she carried on a love affair for many years with the consent of her loving and loyal husband Frank O'Connor, a topic that the documentary almost dodged.  I also would have liked to know more about Rand's more joyful relationships with people like Leonard Peikoff, her intellectual and legal heir, and Alan Greenspan, the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, the U.S.'s central bank.  But for anyone new to Rand who wants the quick and dirty (the DVD is 144 minutes however) on the chronology of her extraordinary life, this is a pleasant and well put together narrative.
I did find extremely fascinating though, sort of as an after thought of the DVD, the whole parallelism I saw with Rand's life from when she was born in 1905 to when she died in 1983, with that of the struggle of America as it became the emergent leader of the free world at the end of the 20th Century.  The America that Rand loved and abandoned Russia for, and which she extolled for its egoism and value of the individual will, became the triumphant ""winner"" in the great experiment of free market and democracy versus altruism (that of sacrificing individualism for the good of the masses), collectivism and communism.  It is sad that Rand was not alive in 1989, just six years after her death, to see the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Rand would have enjoyed seeing that which she said should happen: that rationalism of man should win out over the irrationalism of man, and that rationalism is choosing that which is good for the individual, and that to her, America represented the greatest achievement of the rational man and triumph of individualism.
One more thing:  Rand said that the self should not exist before work.  I take this to heart as I learned how disciplined she was about her writing.  As an aspiring writer, I have to realize that the self should not exist, that comes later.  First comes work.  There can only be work.  Work, work, work, she said, which means, write, write, write to me as it was to her.  This, I take as a lesson, from the documentary.",986083200,9,3804,4.67616191904048
1006324,5,630529285X,"Ayn Rand may be the person about whom the most stupid things have been written, except for the whole class of people about whom only stupid things can be written. Numerous commentators have improvized themselves experts on her thought and proceeded to demolish it in what they were probably convinced was a very clever way. Numerous others, while proclaiming to be her genuine admirers, have tried to make her a virtual monster by blowing some aspects of her life and personality out of proportion, and projecting on her all sorts of morbid fantasies.
*Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life*, on the other hand, maybe the most perceptive concise presentation of Rand's life and works ever made (and as no full-length treatment is available as yet, this is high praise indeed.)
First, it is a first-rate documentary, rivalling with Ken Burns's widely acclaimed works. It is perfect in its structure, roughly following Ayn Rand's life and seamlessly integrating the more philosophical discussions with the biographical material. It is rich in period detail and source materials, from manuscripts and photos to period films, extracts from movie adaptations or theatrical productions of Rand's works, and highlights from her few TV appearances. And it abounds in perceptive interviews with individuals who knew Rand personally and who, for the most part, devoted their careers to studying her philosophy: mostly PhD's like John Ridpath, Harry Binswanger, Michael Berliner or, last but not least, Leonard Peikoff.
But if Ken Burns had done a documentary on Rand, he would certainly have gotten the ideas wrong, as when he tried to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson's theory of individual rights in his biography of the Founding Father, and the whole sense of life of the work would have been totally off, with actors reading lines from Rand's writings in melancholy tones, as if they were about to drown themselves.
So what Michael Paxton has accomplished is a miracle: he has combined the know-how of a Ken Burns with a flawless understanding of Objectivism and of Rand herself. All the fundamentals of her philosophy are presented, and I could not spot a single misrepresentation of them. All the stages of Rand's life are included, down to the small details which a less consciencious biographer might have missed, but which reveal so much about what she was as a person, such as her fondness for what she called her ""tiddlywink music""-light-hearted popular music of the early twentieth century.
The documentary even made me cry twice: when the actress impersonating Kay Gonda, in a short extract from Rand's 1934 play *Ideal*, said: ""I can't forget the man on the rock"" (whom we should all thank Rand for reminding us of); and when Rand testified for the HUAC and described the conditions she had experienced in Soviet Russia under Lenin. I had just watched a documentary on the 200,000 abandoned orphans who live off the streets in North Korea, and the whole families imprisoned and brutalized in concentration camps by the Communist government, and as Rand's words connected with the images I had seen, I understood what she was fighting against with what Leonard Peikoff called the concreteness of a truck speeding towards me.
*Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life* also reveals surprising facets of Rand's life and personality. An atheist, she met her future husband on the set of De Mille's *The King of Kings*, where she worked as an extra, chanting hosannas to Jesus; and she ""felt a benevolent inevitability that they would meet again"". An arch-egoist, she admonished herself in her diary: ""No thought whatever about yourself, only about your work."" And an admirer of America's wealth and glamour, she found Los Angeles ""overcrowded, vulgar, cheap and sad.""
*Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life* is perhaps the best place to start for anyone who wants to know more about this ""American born on Russian soil"" who may well have been the greatest woman who ever lived. For further biographical information, this film can be supplemented by David Harriman's edition of Rand's Journals, and Michael Berliner's edition of her Letters.",982454400,93,4096,5.051698670605613

We did not know what to expect going into the movie, so we went with no expectations (good or bad).  I was pleased with the movie for what it was...a movie about the Woman behind the Philosophy.  I have read several of Ayn Rand's works...fiction and non-fiction and I really did not need to see a movie about Objectivism for I am familiar with it's premise and concepts.  In this regard, the movie was a pleasant surprise.  The movie gave insight into Ayn Rand's personality and passion, not her Philosophy.
Those wishing to find out what Objectivism is really about should read MORE of her works than just Anthem.  Anthem, as is the case with many writers, is a sophmoric entry into the world of literature.  I also read Anthem and found it to be a fabulous story...very inspiring and highly motivating.  Paying close attention to the message in Anthem, one finds that Logan's Run, THX-1138, and many other movies are fashioned after the concepts and premise found in this book.
One reviewer was unable to fully appreciate this documentary for what it was and made snide remarks regarding this movie as well as attacking Ayn Rand, the Woman.  Please do not limit yourself to this misinformed viewer's opinion.

1006326,4,630529285X,"For her legion of readers, Ayn Rand's legendary novels, ""The Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas Shrugged,"" have been life changing experiences.  Her heroes, Howard Roark and John Galt, are rugged individualists oblivious to the world's judgments, and Rand's gift for story telling would have been enough to secure her position as one of the 20th century's greatest authors.  But Rand's novels offered something more: a philosophy she called ""objectivism"" that wasn't too far removed from the philosophies upon which the United States was founded, but which, nonetheless, proved controversial, often mistaken for selfishness.  As a result of the controversy, Rand's standing in the world of literature suffered as her notoriety as a philosopher grew.
Michael Paxton's Oscar nominated documentary isn't likely to alter anyone's opinion of this brilliant, strong-willed woman, nor is it likely to provide the faithful with any revelations that haven't already been made available elsewhere.  The film follows Rand's unhappy girlhood in Russia to her immigration to the U.S., her relationships, both platonic and otherwise, with film director Cecil B. DeMille, husband Frank O' Connor, and psychologist Nathaniel Brandon.  A generous helping of vintage film clips show Rand explaining and/or defending her concepts to the likes of Mike Wallace, Phil Donahue, and Tom Snyder, but there's little in-depth examination of her beliefs, making the film a love letter from a fan for the benefit of an audience already familiar with and devoted to her work.  On that level, it is a success.  For the uninitiated, it may fall short and prove enlightening only after having read the novels.",975456000,19,1666,5.409266409266409
1006327,5,630529285X,"The film opens with Statue of Liberty and Sharon Gless quoting Rand's words ""If a life can have a 'theme song' -- and I believe every worthwhile one has -- mine is a religion, an obsession or a mania -- or all  of these -- expressed in one word: Individualism."" From here the you  go in to the fascinating life of Ayn Rand. This absorbing documentary lets  you see how Ayn Rand came to the United States from Russia with little more  then nothing, and became one of the worlds greatest novelist/philosopher to  have ever lived. Interview segments with Leonard Peikoff bring out clear  and rich picture of Ayn Rand to every fan of The Fountainhead and Atlas  Shrugged will enjoy.",945993600,22,678,4.553719008264463
1006328,5,630529285X,"The price is right again! (Even the VHS copy was affordable when it first became available). As soon as I discovered that the DVD version was on the  way I preordered it for a great price. It finaly arrived and I again was  spellbound. On a good home entertainment system, the experience of watching  this film is now even better. Yes, it does gloss over certain facets of  Rand's life (i.e. Nathaniel Branden, and the fact that some people misapply  her philosophy)but it succeeds in depicting the fundamental benevolent  spirit that Rand, myself and others wish for everyone to have. So it  definitely achieves what it set out to, and does so in a fascinating  manner, recalling many aspects of Rand's life that many of her fans, much  less her detractors, may never have been aware of. Kudos to Michael Paxton  for creating a wonderful film!",941068800,19,844,4.719178082191781
1006329,5,630529285X,"I would have bought this, but the price is too high. geezz Rand didn't expect everyone to  win the lottery did she??. I want to learn more about her, but how can you at that price. Guess I will find a used auction book  instead.",936230400,2,228,4.044444444444444
