3853674,5,B0026IQTR2,"This DVD contains wonderful historical information on the engineering and development of some of the apollo era equipment.  Authentic video of the work and many interviews of those involved fill this video.  If there is any shortcoming I would have to say it is the limited number of machines covered.  I would like to see this expanded to cover many hundreds of the machines instead of only the five or six included. Machines included in this DVD -as I recall are: Saturn V, Service Module, Command Module, Luner Module, Moon Rover.",1251763200,,533,4.835164835164835
3853675,5,B0026IQTR2,"Finally,

A view of the space program from those who made it work. Even though the series only has access to program managers, etc., it gives an idea of the typical (and not so common) problems that engineers face. This is especially true when the problems have never been encountered before. Being an engineer myself, the challenges haven't changed much.

Problems range from keeping the Saturn booster engines running to figuring out how to handle the daily/mundane tasks of providing toilet facilities.

If you want a more detailed viewpoint of how things got done, this is it.",1249171200,,580,4.958762886597938
3853676,5,B0026IQTR2,"As one who had the great good fortune to see these magnificent machines in action, I am very glad to see this sory by the men who made them.  If you enjoyed ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" or ""From the Earth to the Moon"" DVD's you will love this one!  This DVD is the perfect complement to ""Apollo"" by Charles Muray and Catherine Bly Cox. I also highly recommend ""Angle of Attack"" by Mike Gray that tells the inside story of North American Aviation's incredible problems in developing the second stage of the Saturn V - the incomparable S-II-C.  ""Apollo"" by Murray and Cox was published 20 years ago, and it is a delight and just a superb account of how we went to the Moon in 8 years and 2 months after JFK hurled his challenge to the country and at the Soviets. This incomparable book tells the story through the people that solved unsolvable problems.  This DVD actually has them telling the story in their own words.  Of particular interest to the connoisseur is the seldom told tale of Apollo 4, and the near-disaster of Apollo .  The sleuthing of the problems of Apollo 6 is still a tour de force of root cause analysis.  The very next Saturn V that was launched after this near failure went to the Moon carrying Apollo 8.  The human stories retold in this DVD make the unbelievable event come alive.  For those of you who, alas, did not live through this incredible period - this DVD is a good tase of what it was like.",1248307200,33,1422,4.335849056603774
3853677,5,B0026IQTR2,"What makes this collection of documentaries so fascinating and wonderful is firstly they focus on the technical side of the greatest human engineering feat ever achieved, secondly the stories are told by the engineers who were actually involved.
Each episode discusses the designs, trials and tribulations, and final culmination or 'moment of truth' when the system was utilized in the missions. The engineering detail is very good for a documentary and far better than anything I have seen before. The footage is also very good quality and fascinating.
The best thing however, is the people. In explaining the program they show a great deal of humility, intelligence, sometimes humour, and then there are moments where they explain what the stress, long hours and problem solving was doing to their personal lives, and finally they come to terms with their achievement.
If you are an engineer, scientist, or are of a technical disposition you will find this inspirational. There should be more documentaries like this.",1247270400,36,1019,5.219512195121951
3853678,5,B0026IQTR2,"This is easily the best series about Apollo to date. I heard last week that we spent the equivalent of one TRILLION dollars in 2009 dollars on the Apollo program. After you watch this, you will know why. These guys had to invent almost everything as they went. I really thought the Navigation episode was the best, but they were all great. I had never heard of ""Rope Memory"" until this - amazing.",1246406400,3,396,4.438356164383562
3853679,5,B0026IQTR2,"To date, this short series is the best work yet produced by the Science Channel.

Unlike most programs dealing with space flight, this series is about engineers rather than astronauts.  Seeing the cleverness that went into the different elements of Apollo should make you proud of your species.

The producers interviewed many of the surviving project directors and engineering team leaders, including then-and-now photos, a nice touch!  Specific problems and their eventual solutions are described using language suited to a general audience, yet not insulting to their intelligence.  Even the musical score is noteworthy.

For me, the episode on the lunar rover is easily worth the cover price by itself, but the lunar suit comes a very close second.",1245628800,57,752,5.277310924369748

This is the real history not a bunch of sensationalist hokum.  It uses footage from the time of the program and commentary from the people involved who were alive when the program was made.

It's one thing to say 'let's go to the moon!"" and quite another when your tasked with accomplishing that goal. My favorite is ""Saturn V"", amazed to learn Von Braun put a 28yr old engineer as the manager of developing the F1 engine that got us off and going. That engine program alone was a billion-dollars to develop and this was '60's dollars we are talking here!. By the end of ""Saturn V"" I was chocked up with emotion, I damm near shed a tear, if your an Apollo nut this series is not to be missed.",1454025600,,643,4.235772357723577
3853691,5,B0026IQTR2,"These videos are really fantastic and informative.  I was a kid during the space race and know a lot about it but these stories still mentioned things I didn't know.  Some have said this is not technical enough, but there is still a lot mentioned (the second Saturn V launch longitudinal oscillation, the two second stage engine shut downs for different reasons etc.) much of the technical details are better obtained in books. These combine an adequate mention and discussion of the major technical challenges (and they are not sugar coated) with discussions given by the actual engineers.  Also a plus is a nearly non-stop run of period footage that brings the story home.  Having all this collected is a great treasure and very entertaining to anyone interested in the space program, or even engineering in general. It is rather emotional in a few placed and even someone not particularly technically minded will enjoy these.",1451001600,,928,4.967741935483871

I have several movies/documentaries about the subject, but this one is the first that really explained the engineering aspect of the missions.  Did you now that your typical IPOD has 50,000 times more computing power than he mission computer used aboard the spacecraft.  It is absolutely amazing when you really think about.  I really enjoyed the episode on the space suits, and how they evolved.

I also liked that this documentary doesn't focus on the astronauts who flew the missions, rather it focuses on the engineers and program managers who worked behind the scenes.  They have a lot of inside information that you never will hear from the astronauts.

3853706,2,B0026IQTR2,"As an R&D scientist myself I was very disappointed; it's a great effort, and if you want to hear the voices of the Apollo engineers, get this DVD.  But the technical coverage is very superficial, this is a human interest, not a science or engineering movie.  The focus is more on things that went dramatically wrong than right, and on things the producers had good archival footage for, not on what was necessarily important.  The interviews show amazing men who designed the machines, but, with all due respect, they're in their 70's and beyond and their memories are faded and their recollections dim and superficial.  I watched the first two episodes and skipped the rest.",1413331200,,675,4.843478260869565
3853707,5,B0026IQTR2,"Saw this on cable and wanted to own the series.  Was born in the late 1960's and was too young to remember this period of our nation's history though do vaguely remember Skylab.

Episode on Saturn 5 was great.  Comments from engineers about the first launch (Apollo 4) and the power that the old beast had gave me goose bumps.

""My God we've done this.  We've gotten it built.""  ""Shock wave progressing across the water."" ""Like an earth quake in California.""  ""Thought you would be knocked over by the power of that.""  ""You see it move off very slowly......come on...Go! Go! Go! Go!.""  ""You want to coax it.....you know...'Get off of there' "".  ""Ooh....ahh... and then clapping.""

Cannot wait for the SLS's first launch. She is billed to be more powerful than the old Saturn 5. With luck, perhaps the generation who did not see Apollo will experience that.",1412553600,,856,4.677852348993288

3853723,5,B0026IQTR2,This is a great series that goes behind the astronauts and recounts the technical triumphs of the space program as told by the engineers who actually had to design and produce the equipment the US needed to win the moon race.  It makes you appreciate the hard work and sacrifices and ingenuity of the people who had to devise the systems and solutions necessary to make it all work.  At base the space program was about human ingenuity and indefatigable devotion to success.,1403913600,,474,4.698795180722891

3853726,5,B0026IQTR2,"There are a lot of videos on project Apollo which range from documentary (like Discovery Channel's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-We-Left-Earth/dp/B004LGGR2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When We Left Earth</a>""), historical docu-drama  (like HBO's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-the-Earth-to-the-Moon/dp/B002O3Z4QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From the Earth to the Moon</a>""), to the technical, like anything published by Spacecraft Films. Most of these other videos casually brush past the development of the spacecraft involved in the missions, focusing instead on the pilots and ground crews involved with the immediate task of flying these missions (""From the Earth to the Moon"" does a fine introductory job at presenting some of the development phases, but docu-dramas are just that: not actual history). But what Science Magazine has done with this DVD set is nothing short of brilliant: to provide the viewer with the technological obstacles required to fulfill project Apollo's mission objectives.

This four hour DVD set is broken down into 45 minute segments, focusing on the development of the Saturn V rocket, the space suit, the lunar roving vehicle, the lunar module, the command/service modules, etc. With each episode, the producers tracked down key personnel who aided in the design, development, and testing of these machines. The interview style of filming is top notch, and reminds me of the quality Ron Howard employed in interviewing the astronauts for the program ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Shadow-of-the-Moon/dp/B000XJ5TPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Shadow of the Moon</a>."" Hearing the first-hand account of how many of these marvelous inventions came to life is engaging, and at times, jaw-dropping. I was specifically impressed with the development of the spacesuit, especially the care taken in developing custom-fit gloves for each and every astronaut - gloves which had to allow the astronaut enough dexterity to be able to pick up a dime on a slippery floor, but also remain pressurized within the vacuum of space. The number and variety of space suits that were designed and tested was also new to me. ILC Dover company, who finally won the contract, even sent NASA a film of their test engineer playing football in an Apollo spacesuit prototype!

This DVD is not just interviews with the developers of these machines. The real gem here is the careful selection and presentation of rarely seen testing and development film footage. I was impressed with how much material was dug up for these segments. I also watched the whole video in one sitting the first time through. Very engaging!

If you're looking for an excellent companion to this video in book form, I highly recommend W. David Woods' superb book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-Apollo-Flew-to-the-Moon/dp/1441971785/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How Apollo Flew to the Moon</a>.""",1392940800,,3058,6.171361502347418

3853739,5,B0026IQTR2,"""Moon Machines"" was a series of hour-long segments (50 minutes without commercials) highlighting each of the machines or technologies that were vital to the American Apollo program to send men to the Moon.

The segments are about the Saturn V rocket, the Command Module, the Space Suit, The Lunar Lander, the guidance systems and computers, and the Moon Rover. So, practically speaking, you're getting six programs essentially for the price of one - a real bargain.

Each program does an excellent job of highlighting each technology with period video and stills as well as interviews with engineers, managers and technicians who worked on each project and the challenges they encountered. The video really did an excellent job of showing the often torturous path that these men and women had to go through in order to produce each technology under the restraints of the schedule of getting an American to the Moon and back before the end of the decade to meet the challenge originally set by John F. Kennedy.

3853746,5,B0026IQTR2,"Anyone with even the slightest interest in the space program will be absolutely thrilled by this documentary. I don't think I've ever heard this narrator before and he is simply fantastic. When he starts the show with the opening lines, ""In the 1960s, an impossible dream came true, when human beings walked on another world,"" it gives me goosebumps.

It's amazing to see how many of the people who worked intimately on those devices are still alive, and able to give us a firsthand account at how they did it. Right now, the United States no longer has a way to get a man into space, even low Earth orbit. We have to rely on the Russians to do it for us. That's both pathetic, and somewhat frightening. If you consider the level of technology available to them at the time, it's astonishing that they were able to pull off this miracle.

At the present time, when NASA discusses going back to the moon, it's usually said that it will take somewhere on the order of another decade. Here it is 50 years later, with all the new technology at our fingertips, and we can't figure out a way of repeating their feat without working on it for another 10 years. How is that possible? They started from scratch, and it took them just nine years.

With the exception of Apollo 13, which if anything, was more of a technical challenge than the other trips, they went to the moon nine times (8, 10, and 13 didn't land), landed six times, walked around freely - eventually even having a golf-cart-like device - and then came home safely each and every time. Think about that for a minute. This DVD tells the story of how they did it.

I'm so lucky to have grown-up and able to watch the entire thing. It never once crossed my mind that it was all a put on. The conspiracy theorists, who think that it was all a hoax, should be forced to watch this DVD and realize that we not only went, but as the saying goes, ""There's only one thing harder than going to the moon, and that would be faking it.""

Buy the DVD, gather your kids and grandchildren around, and shown them what human beings can do if they dedicate themselves to a goal.",1372982400,,2118,4.379134860050891
3853747,5,B0026IQTR2,"As an aeronautical design engineer who was around during the Apollo days (but too young to have worked on it), I have a special appreciation for what is included in these six 45-minute programs.  Some great ingenuity was needed in order to meet JFK's deadline, and while I might be a bit biased, I think that anyone who was around in the Apollo days will enjoy these programs (aside from the small percentage who still believe that it never happened).

They are well-written, well-edited and seem quite accurate, and while they have enough technology to keep the interest for those of us for whom this is a profession, they are not too deep to stump the layman.  While all the episodes are good, I must admit a particular interest for the one on the LM, since I worked at Grumman the following decade (when they were building wings for the Shuttle).

However, the most fascinating episodes are probably the ones on the seemingly less audacious hardware: the navigation computer, the space suit and the lunar rover.  It's remarkable that today's smartphone has over 50 times the computing power of the machine that got us to the moon, that the space suit was the product of a bra and girdle manufacturer, and that the lunar rover needed some real cool thinking to allow it to fold up enough to fit inside the LM while still being easy to deploy and light enough to bring.

No astronauts, grizzled flight controllers or pundits here, this series highlights the engineers who sweated the details.  Old men now, they look back fondly on an adventure to which they devoted large parts of their lives - with pride, awe, and occasional sadness, especially when they talk about the Apollo 1 fire.  Rather than make this a fast-paced, slam-bang effort, the film makers will linger on the face of an interviewee after he finishes a sentence, catching a raised eyebrow or a frown, speaking far more than words themselves.  As a space enthusiast, I also appreciated the wealth of behind-the-scenes footage unearthed, and how it's not simply used as generic ""b-roll"" as other producers have done, i.e. showing the wrong type of rocket during liftoffs or using footage shot out the command module window during re-entry to ""illustrate"" the Apollo 1 fire.

Could we go to the moon today?  Probably not, but this series highlights a time when thinking big and doing big was a national goal, and engineers like those featured here dreamed the dreams (and turned the wrenches) that brought Neil Armstrong to the moon in the now so-long-ago.

1) Saturn V Rocket
2) Command Module
3) Navigation Computer
4) Lunar Lander
5) Space Suit
6) Lunar Rover

Each episode contains commentaries by a dozen or so of the original Engineers/Managers/Technicians who worked on the specific systems, interspersed with videos relevant to the commentaries.  Each episode captures at least 2 or 3 of the ""problems"" that had to be overcome to develop each of these critical systems, and captures the ""most critical"" and ""high point"" of the Apollo Mission, from the perspective of those who worked on the individual systems.

I watch these documentaries over and over... the Saturn V episode is my favorite.

It is my opinion that the way in which the Lunar Lander episode depicts that Von Braun ""finally came around to accept"" Houbolt's Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) was the ""only way"" to get the moon (within the 10 year goal set by Kennedy) is over-simplified & misleading, and really misses the facts in a number of ways... to see for yourself, one can read an account of Von Braun's own opinion on this subject, in an online article that contains two interviews with Dr. Von Braun (conducted August 25, 1970, and November 17, 1971); in which Von Braun clearly corrects the record on this subject... so, that Robert Seamans & this documentary (made in 2008/2009) would take - in my opinion - an unfair and outdated representation of the situation, apparently cooked up by the press in the late 60's for its ""sensationalist"" angle, is a bit misleading on this important/main historical subject from that particular episode.

For example:

Sample Excerpt from Interview #1:

In the Apollo Spacecraft Chronology, you are quoted as saying ""It is true that for a long time we were not in favor of lunar orbit rendezvous. We favored Earth orbit rendezvous.""

Von Braun:
Well, actually even that is not quite correct, because at the outset we just didn't know which route [for Apollo to travel to the Moon] was the most promising. We made an agreement with Houston that we at Marshall would concentrate on the study of Earth orbit rendezvous, but that did not mean we wanted to sell it as our preferred scheme. We weren't ready to vote for it yet; our study was meant to merely identify the problems involved. The agreement also said that Houston would concentrate on studying the lunar rendezvous mode. Only after both groups had done their homework would we compare notes. This agreement was based on common sense. You don't start selling your scheme until you are convinced that it is superior. At the outset, neither Houston nor Marshall knew what was the best approach. And the fact that Houston happened to study the lunar orbit rendezvous mode was purely coincidental. That mode didn't even originate in Houston-it was first proposed by John Houbolt of the Langley Center. The problem with Houbolt's original study was that his weight figures for the lunar module were based on certain operational assumptions that Houston considered absolutely inadequate for the mission. So, as Houston added realistic requirements to the Houbolt scheme it lost a lot of its original charm. In the end, everybody wondered whether the lunar orbit rendezvous mode would still look attractive by the time the necessary realism had been instilled in it.",1302739200,8,3360,4.943262411347518

It contains valuable video footage filmed during the development of these machines... you will enjoy hearing and seeing the real people explaining how they had to come up with the task of building a dream and knowing that many of them had to sacrifice all and everything to get the job done.
I enjoyed every chapter, but there are two that over exceeded my expectations ""the navigation computer"" and ""the lunar module"".
Don't doubt to order this documentary, it's worth the price.
To all who were involved on the making and participated in all aspects of making this DVD, great work and Thank You!",1301097600,,1154,4.833333333333333
3853814,5,B0026IQTR2,"Much has been written and filmed about the astronauts and their stories and memories of the Apollo space program.  Equally compelling is what happened behind the scenes to make their feats possible.  This video does an outstanding job at documenting the efforts, the problems overcame, setbacks and triumphs of the thousands of scientists and engineers who built the machines. We see how they look back in deep pride for their role in making the impossible possible. Highly recommended.",1299888000,,486,5.217948717948718
3853815,5,B0026IQTR2,"This is a wonderful documentary however, some of the commentary is no longer relevant since President Obama has canceled America's manned space program, and with it America's return to the moon.

Lots of great details on the Apollo lunar module.

3853818,5,B0026IQTR2,"Moon Machines tells the Apollo story in a great way.  It focuses on the equipment that was required and the people who developed that gear.  It is really amazing to watch these men and women talk about a time that was clearly the highlight of their lives.  There is enough technical detail to get the feel for how high of technology this was at the time but not so much that the story bogs down.

There are six episodes covering the Saturn V, Command Module, Navigation Computer (sounds boring but was actually one of the very best), the Lunar Module, The Space Suit, and the Lunar Rover.  The Saturn V chapter really gets things started with some excited engineers talking about the joy and frustration in thier job.  There are plenty of rocket shots-gone-bad but they actually explain what happens.  The Command Module is the most emotional not only in the story of Apollo 1 but also the story about the designers of the parachute recovery system (""imagine what would have happened if the astronauts went to the moon and back then drowned in the Atlantic because my parachute didn't work"").

I get a consistent sense of humility and sincerety throughout from the people who worked on this program.  They felt like they were part of something grand and acted with the fortitude appropriate for the mission.  In the end, I felt a little bit more grand as well.  This is a very inspiring documentary and well worth the watch.",1289952000,,1424,4.656

3853821,4,B0026IQTR2,"This DVD provides an excellent overview of various systems that contributed to the Apollo lunar landings. It doesn't drop down to the layman level of understanding, yet doesn't reach into the esoteric. It deals with some areas not normally see - such as the Apollo ""space suit"" - contains some footage that is not widely seen, and is well worth viewing by everyone interested in the history of the Apollo programme.",1279497600,3,415,4.859154929577465

3853823,5,B0026IQTR2,"I have been a student of the American manned space program for over 25 years and have seen just about everything to come along. For those interested in the hardware aspect of the Apollo program, this DVD ranks right up there at the top.  NASA and its contractors were starting from square one in many aspects of the manned mission to the moon, especially in the development of the lunar module.  Moon Machines brings this to light, utilizing rare footage one doesn't often see.  It will occasionally pass right over what are otherwise significant historical events within the program, but it does so in order to stay focused on the topic at hand.  If you are into Apollo, this is a must.  You won't be disappointed.",1273449600,,715,4.642857142857143

3853826,5,B0026IQTR2,"Wonderful. I loved it. Makes you understand what engineering is really about: challenges, ideas and solutions. The emphasis is - rightly - placed on audaciousness, creativity, (technical) knowledge, tenacity and probably, beyond everything, talent and the human touch needed for dreams to come through. The documentaries abound in really touching moments, especially when the people involved in the projects describe how challenging it was, sometimes from a personal point of view (divorces, not seeing the kids grow,...) and how they were relieved when things worked according to expectations. Behind any complex engineering project, there are men and women, with their dreams, aspirations, fears and emotions, and these documentaries are a wonderful testimony to this. As I said, I loved it and strongly recommend this DVD. It should be seen in any engineering school.",1257120000,,870,5.548872180451128
3853827,5,B0026IQTR2,"Moon Machines is amazing in that the engineers, the people who made the Space Program what it is, share their experience, their deep passion,devotion and memories in this very well made documentary.  My husband and I live in Huntsville Alabama, near the Marshall Space Centre and have had the opportunity to surround ourselves with some of our local NASA engineers, people who work for the supporting industry of space technology and developers through the Von Braun Astronomical Society ([...]) and have great admiration for the accomplishments that revolutionized the world of technology. Some of our members personally know the men and women who are in the Moon Machines DVD Series.  Each Episode offers a fascinating look into how the the Saturn V and it's upper stages, the Command Module, the Lunar Module, The instrument Ring, the F1 engine, the J2 engines, how the space suits were developed, the gyroscope developed at MIT  that guided the apollo capsule around the moon, and so much more! The Saturn V and the incredible, complex issues that had to be resolved in order to go!  Again, told by the people who made the decisions and who together piled up all the stages of the Moon Machine Rocket, the most powerful still yet and fired it in one piece at Cape Canaveral watching millions of parts, wirings, new designs fire successfully!
Moon Machines is a must for your collection if you want to hear the story told by the people who devoted their lives as well as their family's to bring us into the Space Age.
You will guard this one preciously!  We promise!  And, by the way, told in very humorous ways at times too.  Captivating for sure!

3853828,5,B0026IQTR2,"Moon Machines is an outstanding program.  It tells the story behind the scenes of the moon missions that most other programs don't feature. Shows details on how the space suits, guidance system, lunar module and other key hardware were designed & built. A must for air & space lovers",1255651200,,283,4.775510204081633
3853829,5,B0026IQTR2,"Years ago, I heard or read one of the Apollo astronauts deflecting hero worship. I don't remember which astronaut it was, and I certainly don't remember his exact words, but what he said was essentially this: ""I'm just an ordinary man. I can't walk on the moon. But there were thousands of people who designed, built and operated these amazing machines that were capable of carrying human beings to the moon and bringing them back safely, and I was just lucky enough to be one of the guys who got to take that ride.""

Though he certainly understates the contribution of the astronauts themselves, he's right about the thousands of people on the ground. This series of six programs looks at the machines and the men and women behind them: the Saturn V rocket, the guidance computers, the command and service module, the lunar module, the lunar rover, and the space suits.

I've been a space nut for a long time, but almost everything here is new to me. The programs are packed with information, from unseen archival film and interviews with the people who did the work. Production values are absolutely first-rate. I've seen a lot of documentaries about Project Apollo, and this is one of the best. I watched it all in a single sitting, and at the end of each episode, I caught myself saying aloud, ""This is GREAT!""

I couldn't recommend it more highly.",1252713600,12,1352,4.6722689075630255
3853830,5,B0026IQTR2,"The material on this documentary is very interesting- worth multiple viewings to understand it all.  You'll be saying to yourself ""That's how they did it"" over and over again.  The background music is cool. If you've ever wondered how they developed the major machines needed to make the moon landings possible, this is the best documentary to date.  The facts presented put alot of the moon landing hoax theories to rest.  My favorite episode is the lunar Rover with the lunar lander in close second.  Highly recommended.",1252540800,3,522,4.954022988505747
