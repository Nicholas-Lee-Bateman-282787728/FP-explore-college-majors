8083412,5,B000B8IA2Q,My son really enjoys this DVD.  We have all the Wubbulous World DVD's.  Hope there will be more...my son just loves them.,1358208000,,121,4.454545454545454
8083413,5,B000B8IA2Q,"We love the Wubbulous World series.  The characters are Dr. Seuss wacky, and many are well known from the stories (such as Horton, the Cat in the Hat, Sam I Am).  Each video has several vignettes, with silly songs and lots of action.  Each vignette has a moral, that is subtle yet worthwhile.  The videos appeal to parents due to the clean language and subject matter.  They appeal to boys and girls ages 3-8 due to funny puppets, voices, and situations.",1276992000,2,454,4.555555555555555
8083414,3,B000B8IA2Q,"This was the first DVD of its kind that we bought and I think it will be the last, unless the kids develop a greater interest in it.  I think it is hard for them to follow.  I would say it is average though, since there is nothing really to dislike about it--the kids just aren't interested.",1168300800,,291,4.087719298245614
