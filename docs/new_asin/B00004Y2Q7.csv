7926504,1,B00004Y2Q7,"This is not a performance by the Sistine Chapel Choir (misspelled in the opening credits), but apparently of the Cappella Giulia, a mixed-voice choir conducted by the Reverend Monsignor Pablo Colino.

False advertising at its most noxious.",1476230400,,239,5.45945945945946
7926505,2,B00004Y2Q7,"First the good news.  This type of music is very difficult to find in any medium, especially on DVD.  It is for the most part competently performed by an a cappella mixed adult choir of about 50 members.  They perform at about the level of a good average college or community choir in any metropolitan area.  The low rating is not because of the choir (although with a name like Sistine Chapel Choir one might expect a world-class ensemble--that they definitely are not).  They can however be seen enjoying their work--that does count for something.

Now, the not as good news.  The choir is not warmed up for the first few numbers;  the video color is not natural;  there is applause after every number, and the audience popping flash bulbs which is annoying but unavoidable in a live performance, I suppose.  The production is especially marred by roving video cameramen who intrude into almost every scene, retreating from their previous take or setting up for the next one.

All the foregoing could be condoned and forgiven but for the worst news of all:  the program listing on the cover, as well as the DVD table of contents, and the contents as listed by a previous reviewer, have nothing whatsoever to do with the music being presented.  I'm not talking about a few spelling issues, I'm saying that nothing matches, period.  One of the items listed is on a different track, but the other tracks are out of the blue.  And one of the reasons I bought the DVD, listed as Jubilee Triptych for Organ, is simply not there (and no organ music of any kind).

The track selections are as follows.  I can only positively identify a few of them (possibly others, in time).  Listed titles are shown first, in quotes.

1. ""Palestrina---Stabat Mater"".  Actually begins with Vere Dignum, but I can't make out the next phrase (not the usual ""et justum est"").

2. ""Palestrina---Tu es Petrus"".  Unknown, first word sounds like ""Recordare"".

3. ""Gregorian---Victimae Paschali laudes"".  Unknown, lively, definitely not Gregorian, being at least 4 part writing.

4. ""Perosi---Ave Maria"".  Unknown, definitely not Ave Maria.

5. ""Perosi---Cantate Domino"".  Unknown.

6. ""Liberto---Veni ad librandum nos"".  Actually a setting of the complete Pangue Lingua, alternating between Gregorian chant and 4 part between verses, composer unknown to me.

7. ""Bartolucci---Salve Mater---O Sacrum Convivium"".  Actually Adoramus Te Christe by Palestrina.

8. ""Bartolucci---Salve Mater---Exsultate iusti"".  Actually O Bone Jesu, originally attributed to Palestrina, now thought to be by Ingegneri.

9. ""Liberto---Christe Redemptor Omniam"".  Actually a setting of O Domine Jesu Christe, composer unknown to me.

10. ""Liberto---Alma Redemptoris Mater"".  Actually it is Sicut Cervus by Palestrina, discernable from sheet music held by chorister!

11. ""Palestrina---Sicut Cervus"".  Unknown, seems to start with an Adorate.

I'll update if I can identify any more.  I'd appreciate comments from others if they can identify any as well.",1376438400,2,3001,5.179540709812109

7926507,5,B00004Y2Q7,"A fascinating video with an opportunity to hear and see the Sistine Chapel choir performing Renaissance music.

The selection of music was stunningly beautifully performed. This was also technically very difficult music and sung a cappella, a stunning feat.

To be able to see this famous choir on video at home was a rare treat.
