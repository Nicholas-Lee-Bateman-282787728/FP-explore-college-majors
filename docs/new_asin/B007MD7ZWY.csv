8519507,5,B007MD7ZWY,"Oz Vessalius, who just turned fifteen, has always lived a rich and privileged life as an heir to the Vessalius estate. During his Coming of Age Ceremony, he is drawn into an eternal prison called ""Abyss."" While there, Oz is saved by Alice, the Bloody Black Rabbit. Oz and his friends/allies try to uncover the mysteries of Alice and her missing memories, Abyss, and the ""Pandora"" organization.

I love this fantasy/adventure anime! This is such a good take on Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass. The characters are so unique and interesting. The story is exciting and a bit eerie, full of adventure and drama, and even has some comedy thrown in. I just wish they had continued with another season, because so many things are left unanswered. There is Pandora Hearts manga. I'll have to read them to find out what happens. I definitely recommend watching this.",1384560000,,870,4.878378378378378
8519508,5,B007MD7ZWY,"I really recommend this series to anyone, but especially if they enjoy victorian settings for intrigue, drama, and a wonderful alice in wonderland twist. The series is beautifully done in both the manga and anime, but also the plot and character development. This is one of my favorite series, and it never dissapoints. Plenty of action, twists and turns, drama, and tons of humor. Not to be missed!",1371254400,,399,4.882352941176471
