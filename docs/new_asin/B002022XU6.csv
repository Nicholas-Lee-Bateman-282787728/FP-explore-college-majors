8348397,4,B002022XU6,"I'm a Leslie West Fan from way back and a rock/blues guitar player. I had fun with this video and Lelie's sense of humor in presenting an assortment of methods of geting that great guitar tone. His insights to obtaining his vibrato style was helpful. The best part of the video is where Leslie breaks down how to play ""Mississippi Queen."" He doen't get very technical in terms of effects, amp, etc.,and  more on guitar technique and attitude.

Id say ""Buy it"" if you like Mountain and want to enter the world of Leslie West. I saw Leslie recently at the West Fest 40th Woodstock Reunion. He still plays a nasty sounding ""Mississippi Queen"".  Take what you can from the DVD and get inspired a bit. That what guitar can do.

If you're a Leslie West fan like I was, you won't be after you see this. You will learn NOTHING from this DVD other than how to play Mississippi Queen (which is pretty basic anyway). All he does for over 100 minutes is jam in the key of E or A. He has NO chops to speak of. Leslie admits he knows very little about music and mostly plays with only two fingers (slowly) - and that's exactly what comes across on this video. He's vulgar on this video and takes us into a strip club next door. He promises to show you how the studio works, his pedal board, amps, etc., but never does. He even repeats his story of how he started playing in another section, word for word. He must be getting Alzheimer's.

It's a shame, as I WAS a fan. I'm sorry I saw this piece of junk. I can't say it enough - you'll get absolutely nothing from this video except an empty wallet. There are far better videos out there to learn from, from ""real"" guitar players like Yngwie Malmsteen, Joe Satriani, Eric Johnson, Joe Pass, in fact anyone except Leslie West. You'd figure after all these years of playing, he'd actually learn how. I'd have no problem on stage with him, and I don't consider myself anything special.

Wow, if his intent was to show how to NOT make a video, than he succeeded! Run!",1255132800,9,1422,4.224264705882353
8348399,2,B002022XU6,"Let me start by saying that I love Leslie West as a guitar player, always have and always will.

Having said that, I have to agree with Pascal; I was expecting an in-depth discussion of West's entire signal-chain, from his strings to his cables, from his effects to his amp settings. I was NOT expecting the Lenny Bruce of guitar players (no offense to Lenny intended), but that's what you'll get if you buy this DVD.

The freakin' guy doesn't even let you see the pedals he's got on his pedalboard !!

What saves this DVD from getting only one star instead of two is Les' ribald sense of humour. I particularly enjoyed his ""witty banter"" with two Russian pole-dancers from the strip club next door.

Bottom line: this DVD is little more that a mediocre Las Legas lounge act featuring a world-class GUITAR PLAYER !?!  Forwarned is forearmed -- move on to your next selection and don't look back.",1255046400,3,895,4.56875
8348400,3,B002022XU6,"I had been waiting for this new version of ""Big Phat Ass Guitar"" DVD after I could not get the first issue.
I always have been a great fan of Leslie's guitar tone. look up p6x on UT, and you will find an absolutely incredible version of ""Theme for an imaginery western"" performed live by Leslie West.
I bought this DVD hoping to finally solve Leslie's tone mistery, but although I took great pleasure in listening to his playing demo, my questions are still mostly unsolved;
In this DVD Leslie offers demonstrates his ability to make incredible music and tone out of what he says is his limited ability to guitar technique. ""I only use to fingers""-""I can't read music""
I was looking for a detailed review of his effects, amps, something to give me a basis to mirror my own set up. He does touch on what effects and amps he use, two Marshalls and a Fender re-wired as a Trainwreck. But the pedal brands he use are unamed; yes I know you use a delay or a compressor, but which ones? I have a Memory Man and a TC Electronics, I still can't emulate your tone on my Fender The Twin! lol.
The demonstration of how to play Mississipi Queen is fantastic, especially with the hand close up for those whom would want to learn how to play the song.
My overall feeling is that Leslie could have gone the extra mile to give those of us looking for specifics what they were expecting. Hence, the reason why I only find the DVD ""ok"". It is not really to be classified as ""instructional"" DVD;
My final words are, if you like Leslie, you should buy it; Simply for the music, a good showcase. If you are a guitar player wanting to emulate his fabulous tone, you will be left in the cold, but you will be able to learn to play Mississipi Queen.
N.B.
I have now been able to locate one of the original DVD version on Ebay, and I have bought it. I will therefore be able to compare the two versions and will post a write up.",1253836800,,1903,4.259668508287293
8348401,5,B002022XU6,"If you can play, and you like Leslie West, you'll enjoy this DVD. You're not going to learn to play the guitar using this Video. He stresses ""Tone is everything"" and basically that's true. You don't have to be the best player in the world, but with great tone, you can do just fine. There is some cool stuff where he goes over the Amps and Effects he uses, and I love his humor! He tells you how he gets as much as possible playing the Pentatonic and Blues Scale. I got a kick out of one of his lines ""Fenders are good on cars"". He's always been a diehard Gibson guy, although I have seen him using Steinbergers,and Dean Guitars. He plays ""Mississippi Queen"", and ""Theme"" slowly, so you can see what he's doing.  For the price of the video, it is worth it.",1253145600,3,756,4.213793103448276
