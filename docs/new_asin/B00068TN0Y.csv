8475114,1,B00068TN0Y,"Sounded intriguing from the description, however, anything good about it ends right there. In fact, it was so bad that I turned it off in the middle. It was just a mess, which in some places, was just plain disturbing. The bottom line is, there are plenty of other, much better, movies available on Prime, so my advice is to pass this one by and watch something else.",1377129600,,367,4.411764705882353
8475115,2,B00068TN0Y,"It was a drama about murder, Mental Health issues, and execessively close family ties. Mature subject matter, children would be scared.",1371081600,3,135,5.476190476190476
8475116,2,B00068TN0Y,"Turned out to be a little about the invented and nothing about the so called secrets the government were hiding.
Said to be banned from US television, What a joke! Just hype!",1364860800,2,174,4.46875
