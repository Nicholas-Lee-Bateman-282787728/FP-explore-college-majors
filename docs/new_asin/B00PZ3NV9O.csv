8689865,3,B00PZ3NV9O,"Sly (Thomas Daniel) loves alcohol, cocaine, his baby doll Annie (Tabetha Ray) and Jesus but not necessarily in that order. He is traveling with Annie and feels appointed by God to kill sinners and rob Quick Marts. They end up in the house of David Caine (Terry Sasaki), named in order to have meaningless biblical references, in a home break-in type of movie. David works to earn their trust and divide the two, exploiting Sly's mistreatment of Annie.

The metal soundtrack created a grindhouse effect. The acting and dialogue didn't bring their ""A"" game in what amounts to a three man play. David's attempts were slow deliberate and methodical as one would expect in a real situation, but in a film it wasn't entertaining until the end when things started to happen. Great ending BTW, but the filler needed to have some excitement, like tying David up and making him watch them make love, which would have relieved the boredom in the middle of the film as well as added something at the end.

Guide: No swearing or sex. Brief nudity in B&W effect footage",1481673600,,1055,4.697297297297298
