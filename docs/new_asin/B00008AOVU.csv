7980978,5,B00008AOVU,"I love Jerry Baker and follow all his suggestions about gardening. Love the DVD! I always can refer back to information, if I forget a recipe or technique.",1376611200,,155,4.571428571428571
7980979,3,B00008AOVU,"I gained some good gardening knowledge from ""Gardening Wisdom"". However, as many reviewers describe, he does go quickly through the material. This DVD does not utilize any kind of a PowerPoint presentation or other form of notes, so viewers are left to scribble down notes or rewind. Having watched many of his specials before, I have learned to record him with a voice recorder; those devices are much more easier to rewind/fast-forward than a DVD, in my opinion.

While ""Grandma Putt's'"" tonics are made using household items such as beer and dishwashing liquid, their ""green-ness"" can and shoud be questioned. He does believe in using pesticides and herbicides, but only as a last resort in most cases. While this was released in 2003, the footage appears to be a decade older.

In ""Jerry Baker's Gardening Wisdom"", Baker gives some good advice, but be prepared to take notes and hit rewind if you want to absorb the information.",1264723200,2,932,4.929936305732484
