8480801,5,B005NWGHA2,This was a gift for my 85 year-old mother. She loved it! This collection had all her favorite episodes and she laughed out loud on each one. She also enjoyed sharing these classics with her young caregivers.,1478908800,,207,4.621621621621622
8480802,5,B005NWGHA2,"I grew up watching this show with my mother for years as a child. Am thrilled that they put the best ones on one DVD. Once had the entire collection, but there were so many that were before my time and didn't keep my interest. These were the very best ones and I am expecting to enjoy this DVD for a very long time. Amazon is so wonderful in that they make DVDs available to the public that simply cannot be purchased anywhere anymore and especially if you live in small rural areas.",1461974400,,483,4.204301075268817

8480804,5,B005NWGHA2,I must admit either these do not hold up well or I'm overlucied as I did not like them as much as I had hoped. But the favorites were pretty much all there. She was a great comedian.,1377129600,2,182,3.8157894736842106

This is a timeless classic with some of Lucy's favorite episodes. The first staircase scene of Lucy Gets In The Picture is probably my favorite!",1360627200,3,261,4.458333333333333
