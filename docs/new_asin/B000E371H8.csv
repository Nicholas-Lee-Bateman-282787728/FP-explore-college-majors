8104889,4,B000E371H8,"This is another installment of the History Channel's ""Automobiles"" series which looks at one model or make - sometimes both at the same time. This episode was entitled ""Firebird"".

The video is not solely about the Firebird, but contains a lot of backstory. Beginning with the post-WWII era, Pontiac had to compete with the many makes to survive and prosper. Pontiac, formerly a staid, practical brand, acquired a performance reputation with the ""wide track"" stance as the company was run by men suck as ""Bunkie"" Knudsen and John Delorean.

The decision to create the Firebird, as well as Chevrolet Camaro, lies in the success of the Ford Mustang. The Ford ponycar required a response and the Pontiac version was a little more polished than the Chevrolet offering. The DVD then follows the Firebird through the 1960's, the 1970's, the ""Smoky and the Bandit"" Trans Am's and even to the fourth generation models. The video was produced before the decision to drop Pontiac completely so, the video ends on a positive note not borne out by future events.

It's a good DVD on Pontiac and the performance emphasis of the brand. Four stars.",1448582400,,1133,4.890625

It's the future - 2015 - and gas burning vehicles have been outlawed.  This was supposedly done because of a fuel shortage, but we all know it was just a ruse by the Evil Government to control people.

These laws are enforced by the ""Department of Vehicular Control"" or DVC.  The movie even a song about about them (""DVC, DVC, you can't catch a rabbit and you won't catch me"").  More about the horrible soundtrack later.

The laws are opposed by colorful characters known as ""burners"" (that name is probably the best thing in the movie).  They're not really organized, but they all defer to Red, played by Darren McGavin.  The movie begins with the arrival of Red's estranged son, played by a British actor, trying unsuccessfully to do an American accent (trivia: this actor, Robert Wisden, would later play Richard Nixon in The Watchmen).  The burners don't have much of a purpose.  They just rebuild cars, drive around and have fun.  They do *absolutely everything* in their power to get caught.  Not only do they drive across open fields in the middle of the day, kicking up clouds of dust that would be visible for miles, but they announce their activities on CB radios (younger readers may need to be told that these can be monitored by anyone).  Luckily for them, the DVC is totally incompetent, and they only find burners when they stumble on them by accident.  In fact, they're so incompetent, they can't find Red's secret hideout, although it appears to be the only building for miles around.

The leader of the local DVC patrol is McVain, played be Doug McClure.  He's conflicted about his job, and trying desperately to keep his agents under control, since they tend to get murderous and rapey if left to their own devices.  One of them is morphing into an American Indian in reaction to some previous trauma.

That's basically the movie.  It's not a spoiler to tell you there will be lots of car chases and explosions, but not nearly enough to make the movie interesting.  If you don't know there'll be a romantic interest for Cam, it's because you've never seen a movie.  The movie doesn't so much have an ending as get to 90 minutes and stop.  If you listen carefully at the end, there's *one line* that alludes to a subplot that would have given the burners a purpose and the movie a point, but unfortunately, they forgot to put it into the rest of the movie.

It's hard for someone my age not to get a little nostalgic for a movie that stars Darren McGavin *and* Doug McClure.  To be fair, McGavin does the best he can and any entertainment value the movie has is due entirely to him.  McClure mumbles his lines and looks genuinely embarrassed to be in the movie.

Probably the worst thing about the movie is the soundtrack.  Commissioning a set of custom songs must have eaten up a lot of the movie's tiny budget, and it definitely wasn't worth it.  The low point is the love song accompanying Cam's little romance.

Speaking of songs, here's some trivia:  this movie came out in 1981, the same year Rush released ""Red Barchetta"", which basically has the same theme.  Of course, rock songs don't need to make sense.

I suppose your bad movie education is not complete without seeing this movie, but trust me, you won't enjoy it.",1447286400,,3442,4.617792421746294

8104893,1,B000E371H8,"I suppose that calling this an ""ACME TV Classic"" is supposed  be a wink and a nod ""joke."" Of course, the ""joke"" is on whoever plunks down good money on this. OK, the movie is really bad and maybe it is supposed to be in the cheap B-movie tradition. But for an Eighties film, the video transfer is far worse than one would expect. As usual with companies like this, they rummage through garbage bins and find obscure titles like this on VHS, and regardless of their quality put them out for gullible people. If the quality of the transfer is beyond horrible, to me that just makes a bad movie even worse, because it is rendered unwatchable from the first frame.",1394150400,,660,4.409836065573771
8104894,4,B000E371H8,"Sometimes confused with ""The Last Chase"" with Lee Majors, this is a cheaper version by far. It is somewhat entertaining if you consider the time it was produced and the political climate.",1392076800,,187,4.875
8104895,2,B000E371H8,I bought this movie thinking it was another movie I had been searching for but it turned out this wasn't the movie so I watched it and thought it was goofy.  I actually left the room acouple of times because I got bored.,1340841600,,220,4.116279069767442
8104896,3,B000E371H8,"In 2015 the government has outlawed private automobiles in a policy Al Gore would no doubt love. Darren McGavin (who only two years later would star in the brilliant ""Christmas Story"") plays ""Red"", a burner, a person with an illegal car, in his case a blue Firebird. This Canadian production reeks of incompetence from the acting (McGavin is by far the best actor present) to the direction, script, and basic premise. Note also the rockin' soundtrack featuring songs protesting the ""DVC"" (i.e. the ""Department of Vehicular Control"") and recollecting that horrible day in 1992 when gasoline was banned. Later there is an astonishing waltz (the ""Firebird 2015 AD"" Love Theme) that has the most saccharine lyrics I have ever heard this side of fellow Canadian Terry Jacks. Please also note the incredible proliferation of boom mics captured here for posterity.

The movie is an excuse to have a lot of driving around in the desert, with occasional gunplay and explosions. There is a tepid teenage romance featuring astonishingly clumsy innuendo, and a subplot about struggles within the DVC about killing burners. For me the clear highlight of the film centered on rogue DVC agent ""Dolan"" (Alex Diakun) who is a half shaman-half shogun who takes time to meditate and run around in a loincloth and face paint while howling at various things...absolutely stupefying.

The film teaches viewers a lot about high speed chases. For instance, I never knew that if snipers were firing on your car from close range with high-powered rifles with scopes, that the best solution was to do doughnuts in an open field within range of the guns for ten minutes. Now I know. For some reason, despite the extraordinarily high price of gasoline on the black market and the issue of having DVC agents with guns out to shoot at unauthorized cars, the film revolves around pointless driving and racing in the desert. Before it's over there's a ludicrously executed kidnapping plot to be resolved, a Senator to transport to a congressional meeting to reauthorize motor vehicles for the public, a long climactic shootout, and a woman demonstrating that in 2015 the proper way to shower is with all your clothes on.

I give this movie three stars for unadulterated camp value. It wanted to be a cross between a Steve McQueen thriller and ""Warrior of the Lost World"" apparently, but when not taken seriously (and how could you?) it's a funny way to spend an hour and a half. It would have made a perfect episode of MST3K, and that's high praise indeed.",1253750400,5,2523,4.890186915887851
