8310778,5,B001IBOEPC,"The Bret Michaels DVD featurs four brand new, never-before-seen, acoustic performances from Bret Michaels, including 2 classic Poison hits ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn"" and ""Something To Believe In"", and 2 of his solo songs ""All I Ever Needed"" and ""Driven"". All 4 songs are taken from his solo album ""Freedom of Sound"" and the 2 solo songs also feature on ""Rock My World"" his latest album. The DVD from Time Life also includes behind-the-scenes footage, rare photos and in-depth interviews with the lead singer of Poison.
This DVD was a part of the Hard & Heavy CD/DVD collection from Time Life which was advertised by Bret Michaels on tv. The DVD is great but would've been even better if it was a little longer for example Bret's 4 music videos (""Raine"",""All I Ever Needed"",""Go That Far"" and ""Fallen"") could've been included on the DVD which would've made it perfect.",1227052800,6,866,4.78
