4507649,4,B004ZBFRLM,Not bad for a college freshman movie.  Actors did a good job and the story has some unexpected turns.  Not award winning but solid fun to watch.,1365724800,,144,4.296296296296297
4507650,4,B004ZBFRLM,"Indy flicks are alive and well and this is a good one to wrap your head around.

Here's the scoop. Aaron is in college, ahead of his time, enrolled in an advanced engineering program. His mom is overbearing and his dad in milquetoast. He really would rather be an artist. He gets involved with and older woman student who has a rough past. Her daughter starts to dig him and there is kind of a cool female student in the wings. It all gets really messy.

As in all good indy films the writing and acting are at the heart. The set-ups might not be too original, and you see fairly early on where these set-ups might lead, but it's still full of surprises. Aaron is younger than his classmates and gets involved with things that are beyond his years. He navigates through the situations as best he can but they are messy and he's lucky he's smart and has a good heart. A lesser person would have been eaten alive. He likes Linda, the older woman. He's too young for her. Her daughter likes him. She's too young for him. Then there's Wes (Esai Morales) who's a cop also in love with Linda. Each character is on the brink of going off the deep end. They stumble and bumble but end up none the worse for wear.

They dot the film with glimpses of his artwork and fill it with a lot of nifty tunes. Enough was spent on production to give it a professional sheen. You like these folks. None of them are bad. They just have issues that are at odds with one another. Aaron is having difficulty with his big engineering project (walking on water) so the viewer really wants to see if he'll nail it. How will the relationships work out. I was satisfied with the way things played out. Everybody wins (or at least doesn't lose) in a way that didn't seem too pat. Kyle Gallner, as Aaron, played the doe-eyed card a bit too much. Esai was steady. Laura Allen and Britt Robertson did well as mom and daughter. Zosia Mamet as Darcy left me wanting more. I would like to see a sequel to see if her and Aaron have any relationship in the future.

This is a cool flick with a lot going for it. If indy films are your poison, this should do you well.",1352160000,4,2129,4.249382716049383
4507651,4,B004ZBFRLM,"It's not perfect, but it would do. It's about Aaron and how he get's into college. Aaron is one of those smart people and he in college at the age of 17. He get's into a top Ivy league school and in a tough engineering program. But, we see him not too interested in it as to in his Art class. This is where he meets Linda and she 30 something years ago. He learns a lot from her and they become friends. Later he finds out that she has a 14 year daughter, Beth.

Beth is very independent and very different from Linda. Beth really gets on Aaron neves. But, he still okay with that and starts to fall for Linda. He then finds out Linda has a BF, West and is so, so about Linda. But, starts to like Beth.

Now, everything starts to fall apart and Aaron is in the middle of everything and he starts to come to age now. He helps out Linda, Beth, and West with their problems and they become a family at the end. Aaron learns more about life and what it has to offer and he is well on his way to get on with his new life.

I felt this movie had a great plot and characters. It seems to be a very low budget movie but all the actors were awesome playing their roles. The acting is really made this movie good. The script was okay, but the actors made it better. There were many great moments and scenes. I do recommend this movie.",1336694400,,1324,3.9886792452830186
4507652,3,B004ZBFRLM,"As you might expect from the title, this entry in the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival concerns itself with a freshman entering college saddled with an inconvenient virginity. I automatically braced myself for a snicker and grin T & A-type toga party, but had to quickly alter my expectations. Although there are a few bongs around, the story quickly evolves into a far more complicated one.

There are no ""name brand"" actors in the cast, so I'll just talk about the characters:
  * Our hero is a talented artist but his parents are determined that he will be an engineer. His roommate is such a successful lothario, our guy quickly becomes sleep deprived.
  * One fellow student in his art class is a gorgeous woman (NOT a girl!) who seems flirtatious and approachable. There is a reason why she doesn't drink, though.
  * Our hero's roommate is the stereotypical horndog whose life is a constant party. He isn't above a practical joke or two, either.
  * A delectable 14-year-old girl gets a BIG crush on our hero. Problem is, she's the daughter of that gorgeous woman in his art class!
  * The parents footing the bill for this iffy college career are understandably concerned.

 This is a film that will have trouble finding an audience. It's too dramatic for a comedy; too funny for a drama; doesn't have enough sex for a toga party; has too much sex for a family film.

Hmmm...

Our hangdog hero will eventually have his day, though. Whew!

Amazon.com has both new and used DVDs of this one.",1335139200,2,1505,4.665399239543726
4507653,2,B004ZBFRLM,"CHERRY starring Kyle Gallner & Brittany Robertson.

Supposedly a funny coming of age movie in which a virginal college freshman falls in love with a 31 yr. old freshman that has a 14 yr. old daughter who falls in love with him. I thought this could be really funny & touching at the same time but the characters are just toons. I never felt that this was happening to people & therefore could of cared less about what happened to them. A 40 yr. Old Virgin remake or more like a scaled down American Pie with Adult toons thrown in. If you want to see a penis under a wooden ruler this is your show. If your interested in a better coming of age comedy see http://www.amazon.com/Gotcha-Anthony-Edwards/dp/B00009AOBK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326817301&sr=8-1 2 Amazon stars for CHERRY.",1326672000,3,780,4.909090909090909
4507654,5,B004ZBFRLM,Can't recommend this movie enough. It really creates a sense of longing. Wonderful acting. Well composed shots. The music was spot on. Great little film!,1324857600,3,153,5.16
4507655,4,B004ZBFRLM,"This movie is about Aaron, a 17-year-old who just went away to college. His parents expect him to be an engineer, but Aaron is drawn (pun intended) to the arts. In an art class, Aaron meets a 30-something student named Linda, and they become fast friends. But Aaron finds himself attracted to her... and Linda's 14-year-old daughter is attracted to him. Along the way, he also has to deal with his oversexed roommate and overprotective mother.

What really carries this film is the wonderful performances by all the actors. The always-impressive Kyle Gallner (who I usually see in horror films) is very likable as Aaron. How is this actor not a star?! However, I was most impressed by Britt Robertson, who plays the 14-year-old (I was shocked to find out she's 21 in real life..she truly did look like a teenager!) Britt's performance is multi-layered and expertly played.",1320364800,6,872,4.891891891891892
4507656,5,B004ZBFRLM,This movie exceeded my expectations. Kyle Gallner impressed me again with another phenomenally played role. I highly recommend this movie.,1315353600,3,138,5.95
4507657,5,B004ZBFRLM,"Cherry is a brilliantly told story, and it's never predictable or unrealistically cute, as so many movies tend to be. The look of the film, as well as the costumes and locations, are all beautiful and the music is well-chosen. The acting is excellent as well, particularly by Kyle Gallner (Aaron) and Britt Robertson (Beth). I was most impressed with the story itself, and how there is so much going on in terms of conflicts and characters, but it never felt overcrowded; there is a natural, easy flow to the movie. At its core (pit? ...sorry), Cherry is a story about growing up - not so much about the main character losing his virginity, but about him becoming a man in a much more real sense. I think that emotionally, everyone will be able to relate to it in some way. Overall, it's just excellently crafted and worth watching. If you rented it and liked it, be sure to buy the DVD; indie movies as good as this really need and deserve your support.",1315267200,19,954,4.488505747126437
4507688,5,B004ZBFRLM,"I had no idea that I would absolutely fall in love with this movie. I thought it would be another teen movie but I couldn't have been more wrong! This movie actually had depth to it, it was an emotionally moving, interesting, and heart warming movie. I ended up watching this twice, which is extremely rare for me! Definitely worth the watch! Watch it until the end and you certainly won't regret it. I genuinely can't believe this movie isn't more popular. Wonderful actors and actresses, great storyline, and intriguing from beginning to end. Probably the best movie I've watched on Amazon Prime so far, not an exaggeration.",1525305600,,626,4.805555555555555

4507691,4,B004ZBFRLM,"Enjoyable film, the essence of a dramedy, with emphasis on the comedy. It touches on some deeper topics but doesn't really explore them. This is the second time I've watched it and I enjoyed it as much as I did the first time. I'll watch pretty much anything Britt Robertson is in. It's a plus when the film is as good as this one. If you're a fan of hers, watch Ask Me Anything. It deals with some deeper issues than this piece of fluff, enjoyable as it is.",1523232000,,458,4.157303370786517

4507697,5,B004ZBFRLM,"So much more than what the cover potrays it to be. This is a well written, beautifully acted potrayal of both the pains and joys of life. It never allows itself to get cheeky or cute. There are scences that can be tough to watch but it does an amazing job of showing you each of the characters feelings. A great movie. Its one of the better movies of 2010 which was a great year in movies. This is one worth watching",1520380800,,416,4.085365853658536

While there were some humorous episodes, this was actually a  serious drama with far more depth than is typical for this genre.  Acting was excellent, and the characters nimbly avoided cliche with even the most annoying of them having redeeming features.  This was much less about ""getting the girl"" and much more about people finding their way through life.  Best I've seen in a while.",1402444800,5,516,4.818181818181818

He was attracted to the daughter a little; but he treated her as a little sister. I love how he interacted with the daughter and I would love to seen what happened when she turned 18 years.

A real well made and much enjoyable film from a real good writer and director. The acting was very good from all of the characters. It takes me back to some of the typical hi-jinx from my college days!! A real high-ho to Britt Robertson who is a real good young actress! I have seen her before in a couple of other recent films and she is quite good. I recommend this movie, It has intellect,great young romance a little animal house fun, as well as some serious coming of age drama and upheaval!!

It is so realistic and true to life it's almost like not even watching a movie, but rather having a bird's eye view of a small piece of reality.

The acting is simply outstanding.  All of the main characters are not only believable, they are so superbly brought to life it 's nothing less than stunning.  Each and every actor in the film does a truly remarkable job.  None of the scenes seem forced or contrived at all.  I haven't cared this much for individuals in a movie in a long, long time.  The quality of the acting and directing  is just fantastic.  It is so rare to see a film with this level of honesty and realism in the emotions and interactions between the characters, as well as in the events taking place.  I was engaged from the first few minutes all the way until the very end.  When it was finished, I uttered the words ""Oh my God, an actual movie"".  A very simple way to say that I was so impressed with the quality of every aspect of this brilliantly conceived and executed gem of a movie.  Highly recommended for anyone who would enjoy a real, passionate, genuine, honest film.",1526342400,,1250,4.378260869565217
