7974705,1,B00007AJGI,I guess you get what you pay for. This movie is very old & our son didn't get into it at all.,1347494400,,93,3.272727272727273
7974706,5,B00007AJGI,"I bought this DVD because I took my son and his friends to see it 5 years ago for a birthday party.  At the time I was blown away by a vert ramp routine by Bob Bernquist.  It was simply the best example of an athlete being ""in the zone"" that I had ever seen.  I wanted to see if my memory was accurate.  It was.  Bernquist's ride is poetic.  I don't watch the rest of the disc, but consider I got more than my money's worth.",1243296000,,424,3.8160919540229883

7974708,4,B00007AJGI,"ESPN's Ultimate X is the most entertaining IMAX film that I have seen. It features Thrills galore with amazing stunts done on moto cross vehicles, skateboards, BMX racing bikes, and the Street Luge. The music in the film also provides a rush and ads a lot to the stunts performed. The only thing I didn't understand was in the opening credits, they showed a guy doing stunts on a wakeboard, and I got really excited thinking that they were going to have a segment on wakeboarding. But, as the movie time wound down, there wasn't one. So I was kinda disappointed, but it wasn't really a flaw in the movie. It was very well made. I also didn't like how it was only 40 minutes long because I ached for more. It was a fun film, and I think that it has something for everyone to enjoy. The 75 year old grandma taking tickets at the door kept talking to me about how neat it was. This movie is definitely worth your time. Check it out!!!",1040688000,4,931,4.295454545454546
7974709,4,B00007AJGI,"Bruce Hendricks's did a wonderful job with this documentary on the X-Games. The film has some of the best cinematography I have ever seen in a sports movie. The best segments were the sequences involving Freestyle Motorcross.
These sequences had booming, yet tastefully used scoring for music. The way the camera is used is very nice, the shots are extremely clean and varied; making the films like ""Childeren of a Metal God"", and ""Crusty Demons of Dirt"" look ametuerish. The audience begins to love Pastrana and hate Deegan. So there is a sense of characterization in this flick. Still this pales in comparison to Bruce Brown's 1971 classic ""On Any Sunday"".
The skateboarding sequences are also suberb. Hendricks's is a good story teller, and makes these seemigly bland andrenaline junkies seem like the real people that they are.
The downsides are the lack of naration other than that of the athletes and commentators. It would have been better without the ESPN commentators for their commentary in the movie seemed to be rather patronizing, and at its worst, propaganda for ESPN.
Also the street luge was well shot, but was just style without substance.
Overall a movie defintely worth seeing if you like good cinematography, well done documentaries, or just like guys going all out.",1039392000,,1286,5.014018691588785
