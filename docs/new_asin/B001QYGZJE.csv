8336868,2,B001QYGZJE,"If you're a big fan of BJ and MMA like myself, there isn't much here that you haven't heard or seen before.  As stated in other reviews, the production is very much on the cheap, and if you've seen the UFC Primetime Series which basically covers the same time period then it will look that much worse in comparison.  The fact that the UFC didn't allow them to use fight footage is fairly maddening.  This is a documentary to hype one of their biggest fighters, what's the real harm in letting them show what he does best?  I did enjoy some of the earlier footage of his BJJ career, but overall I really can't recommend it.",1264204800,,622,4.336206896551724
8336869,2,B001QYGZJE,"I'm a BJ Penn fan, don't get me wrong--but the production on this movie and the little quirks that they do really annoyed the hell out of me!  They had to distort the UFC images so bad because they probably didn't even try to get the UFC's approval to show the images on their videos.  Amature! Real Amatures!",1263772800,3,309,4.310344827586207
8336870,3,B001QYGZJE,"First off, let me say that I think BJ is a great fighter. Still working on trying to break into professional mixed martial arts myself, I would consider it an honor to one day be worthy of actually challenging BJ.  That being said, my title for this review pretty much sums it up.  I watched this a few months back and I can't remember seeing anything I didn't like about it.  Actually, I can't remember anything that really stuck out about this movie.  If you're interested enough to buy this dvd then you probably already know most everything that it'll tell you about BJ.  You probably already know that he came from a well off family and started out with more money than your average fighter.  You probably know that he's tough, trains hard (although not as hard some of the other top fighters), and lives in Hawaii.  Really this dvd isn't likely to change your opinion about BJ, whether you love him, hate him, or couldn't care less.  I still recommend this movie to anyone interested, but don't feel like you're missing out if you pass up on it.",1259280000,,1051,4.494736842105263

90 DAYS

BJ Penn is one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time and possibly the best ever in my opinion, The Prodigy is highly entertaining and supremely talented. BJ is not only a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu but he trained under the Gracie's and became the first non Brazilian to win World Jiu-Jitsu Championship on the black belt level. I have been a fan of his since I first had seen him and was hooked ever since. BJ to me is the perfect fighter especially when he really wants it or when he is not being cheated [either by judges or greasing]. I am sure a lot of people will disagree with me but in my opinion he is one of if not the greatest of all time.

This documentary is about the 90 days leading up to the GSP rematch fight at UFC 94 and has nothing to do with the UFC 94 lead in show that they were filming at the same time. Because not only does this film focus on his training up until the fight but it is also a look back on his career .While the look at his work out regiment is great and people like myself will love it even I will admit that the biggest selling point of this DVD is the look back at his career. Starting obviously with his childhood and how he got into Jiu-jitsu into his training with Ralph Gracie, love that fact. Of course going into the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship is very interesting and the actual footage of him in it is a great addition to the documentary.

Of course his first run in the UFC is covered up to the first fight with Jens Pulver which is a classic for sure but Penn would loose that fight. From there his final fight in his first run is covered when he defeated Matt Hughes for the Welterweight title. This is one of the most interesting points on the DVD, the split from the UFC and the fall out with Dana White. This is just one more thing that a fighter is saying about how Dana can be a little crooked, so many are saying it has to be true. But if it would not have happened we would not have gotten all those fights Penn had outside of the UFC, like his fight with another great, Renzo Gracie. His fights in Dream and at Rumble on the Rock and such would never have happened.

Then of course the infamous return is covered as BJ would have a great battle with GSP, their first encounter was great in which BJ lost by split decision. This is a touchy subject with me because BJ really won that fight and I will never be convinced other wise. Of course it seemed like destiny when GSP got injured and BJ got his rematch with Matt Hughes for the Welterweight title. If you did not see the fight BJ dominated Hughes for two rounds but then after something happened he got stopped by Hughes when the ref stepped in. From here we get insight into BJ's return to lightweight when he destroyed Jens Pulver, Joe Stevenson, and Sean Sherk, Penn's take on these fights are great. Plus he is now a title holder in two different weight divisions. But then it goes into what this DVD is all about, the rematch with GSP. Which brings me back into his training which believe me he was putting in work, I wish the greasing would not have happened.

The look into Penn's training and the build up to the fight with GSP is great and the look from his corner during the fight makes it look even more epic. The thing about that fight is every one that watched it knew after the second round something was up. For those who do not know GSP got caught greasing his body up after every round, which makes BJ's Jiu-Jitsu useless because he just slides off GSP's back with his legs and such. If you have not seen the grease gate video you need to check it out. But GSP won the fight so that makes two fights with him BJ was screwed in.

The special features are great with interviews and all kinds of things, like the hilarious ""Who's the best"" feature, excellent. Also there is an interview with BJ four days after the GSP fight that is real interesting. This is an excellent documentary and my review does not even touch the surface, if you don't have this you must buy it now. BJ Penn is one of the greatest fighters in the history of the world, with out a doubt.",1244937600,,4119,4.194444444444445
