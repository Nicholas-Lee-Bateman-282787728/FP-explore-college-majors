594004,5,6303201423,"I found the video to be perfectly geared towards my post pregnancy condition. While the exercises might be basic for some, I found they worked well to get me started back into a regular routine and still produce  results.  The format is well laid out in 3-10 min.segments that were  easy enough to follow,and were not so difficult they were discouraging.",940550400,24,354,4.770491803278689
7840789,4,6303201423,"I could not believe how well this video works on the abs! I felt the burn immediately, and noticed that I was holding myself with better posture after the first workout. After having done the video only a few times, I can tell a difference already.",1062547200,,248,4.413043478260869
7840790,5,6303201423,"I really liked this video. It was a bit tough right after the baby was born. But it got better, because the video is set up for you to get stronger gradually. And contrary to the title, it helps strengthen your abs, legs, and buns! A good purchase.",1025136000,6,248,4.1875
7840791,5,6303201423,"My baby is 3.5 months old now. I've had this video for 6 weeks, and wish I'd gotten it earlier.
Good Things:
1) Tape divided into shorter workouts that you can put in your day whenever you have and extra 10 minutes.  Warming up, abs, thighs, and butt are all covered, plus some pushups.
2) I really did 'feel the burn' on these!
3) Madelaine is a fun workout leader, and is energetic - it really helps.  I also like that all the women in the video had babies recently. Of course, they look alot better in their tights than I do right now, but, well, that's why I got the video!
4) She has one of the gals in her group doing exercises the way you do them if you still have the separation in your stomach muscles.
5) The exercises in each segment start easy and get progressively harder, so you can stop if you have to.
6) She doesn't ignore the upper body - you have to do pushups! Ack! Even though you only do a couple of sets, it makes a difference.
7) No special equipment required.
Bad Things:
1) I was wishing for more!
Definitely a keeper - I think that it would be good whether you were previously athletic or not - no matter what, after the last 3-4 months you were pregnant, some muscles are just going to need some work!",1024531200,35,1229,4.159663865546219
7840792,5,6303201423,"This video is very nice because it's divided up into sections.  There's a warm-up section, an abs section, a buns section, and a legs section.  Each section is 10 minutes long, so it's very nice to use.  I can fit it in when the baby is taking a short nap or I only have a few minutes.  It definitely tones the muscle groups in each section!",1018396800,,341,4.121212121212121
7840793,5,6303201423,Just the right amount and intensity of exercises.  I really like the instructor too.,1015977600,,84,5.0
7840794,4,6303201423,I bought this recently after the birth of my 2nd child - needing to lose about 50 pounds & really get back in shape.  This tape - unlike others I've tried - isn't too hard if you're not in shape at all.  It's broken down into different sections so you can do just what you're able & there's a definitive stopping place.  I would really recommend this for those post-partum pounds!!,997747200,7,381,4.338028169014085
7840795,5,6303201423,"I have always HATED exercising.  Gym was my LEAST favorite class in school.  I always found aerobics instructors annoying and their workouts boring, and thier crew just made me feel even worse about myself
This video goes against all that!  Madeline is motivating! She does her best to instruct without annoying you.  She doesn't talk needlessly, only to give directions.  She makes sure you are doing each exercise to the best efficiency.
The women working out along with her are actually REAL PEOPLE!! They are NOT supermodels, and that makes me feel better.
The exercises are arranged in such a way that you do not get bored! Just when you think you can't take any more, she switches to a different one.  She emphasises that you only need to do what YOU feel comfortable with.  I felt good that I could only do the first 2 segments for a while, until I felt able to go on. Now, I find I can actually do the entire video without being annoyed, and I really feel like I worked out.
I imagine that if you are a very fitness oriented person, you may want something more advanced, but until your body is ready for it, this is a great jumping-off point.
Again, a pure joy!",995587200,9,1169,4.460093896713615
7840796,4,6303201423,"I found this video to be a good starting point for my post-pregnancy weight-loss and exercise plan.  After delivering my first child, I was surprised at just how sore my body would be.  Madeleine Lewis' exercises  were just the solution for gently easing me back into an exercise program.  Her exercises are gentle but effective.  After doing this exercise program  for three weeks, I feel like I have strengthened my muscles enough to try  even more challenging videos.  I would highly recommend this video to any  new Mom looking to get back into some fitness program.",951004800,16,570,4.854166666666667
7840797,5,6303201423,"Easy to follow workout.  The exercises really target the areas that need work after pregnancy.  I've only used it three times and already I see results, especially in the abs.  Madeleine Lewis' upbeat attitude keeps you  motivated during the workout and will help you to continue exercising  everyday.",950313600,16,301,5.1875
