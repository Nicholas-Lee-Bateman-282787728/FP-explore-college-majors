3506334,5,B001C4ZQ9I,"The name Genghis Khan evokes many images. This movie provides insights into the social and political climate that Tem&uuml;jin (Genghis Khan) faced while uniting and ultimately expanding the Mongol Empire. From checking a few sources, it appears that much care was placed on being true to what factual information exists about his life.  This film delivers a very entertaining movie with insights into Tem&uuml;jin's childhood and adult life.

As Tem&uuml;jin  grows, we see him face a series of adversities that build his character and provide credibility as a leader.  At the end of the film, I found myself marveling at how part of Tem&uuml;jin's success involved challenging conventions of the time and being willing to take risks.

The film is in Japanese, with excellent English subtitles. The plot was easy to follow and kept a good pace start to finish. The action/fight sequences had some blood, but not really distracting to the overall rhythm of plot. The cinematography was beautiful with sweeping shots of rugged nature and rolling plains. The characters were all well-played and very believable.

As a foreign film, this movie sets a high bar for the action/historical drama genre we're typically used to getting from Hollywood. Definitely one my wife and I will enjoy seeing again.",1220140800,,1296,5.177033492822966
3506335,3,B001C4ZQ9I,"Genghis Khan was one of the great military minds of history. He built an empire that spread from China into Europe. His armies fought in modern Hungary and even, if I remember correctly, into Vienna. One of his few failings, in fact, was was attempt to invade Japan. An effort that was foiled by the original kamakaze.

This film tells the life of Genghis back when he was just Temujin. We see him coming of age, meeting his future wife and blood-brother, and learning military tactics. The story leads from there up to his rise to power, eventually becoming Khan and ends with him about to invade China.

Technically the movie is quite good! Filmed on location in Mongolia, you see some of the areas where the battles actually happen. The battles themselves, when you see them in the film, are stunning! I understand there were thousands of extras involved in the film, and you really see them. The only real problem with the battle scenes is that they are rather brief.

The costumes are impressive, and the sets are well done. Love the wheeled yurt. :)

Where the movie fails is that it seems rather disjointed at parts. I'm betting there are large parts of the film we aren't seeing. I don't know if they are available in a special edition overseas or something, but they are sure aren't here.

The film gets four stars from me, but the DVD gets exactly zero. Why? First, there's no extras. At all. Zero. There's trailers, but I never count those. There's also a very annoying trailer at the begining of the DVD which you aren't allowed to skip over. I'm also rather confused as to why Funimation, which apparently specializes in anime, is releasing this DVD here in the States.

Still and all, I liked this movie. I don't know that I'll watch it again, but I'm glad to have watched it once.",1220140800,34,1795,4.559006211180124
3506336,5,B001C4ZQ9I,"From the opening shot to the end of the film, I was struck by the beauty of the landscape/cinematography, and was reminded of the beauty of Dances With Wolves.

The film introduces us to the legend of Genghis Khan, most notably his childhood and early years. It captures well the spirit of the nomadic way of life for the tribes of Mongolia, and how this deeply impacted the women of the region - who were treated more as spoils of war/trophy objects, rather than people. Often the women were kidnapped and raped, sometimes becoming the wives of their captors, and bearing the children which resulted. This is important to understand the psychology of Genghis Khan - his mother was kidnapped (and there are questions as to who his real father was) and his wife is also kidnapped in a revenge attack later on. We also bear witness to his killing of friends and family members, sometimes forced to by a convoluted sense of honour.

As someone who knows a little Japanese, I found it odd to hear everyone speaking Japanese. I also cannot help but feel that the film somewhat glorifies Genghis Khan  - perhaps he was as deeply thoughful, noble and honourable as they portray him to be...and yet I cannot help but feel that the true person was a darned sight more brutal that the film depicts.

Nonetheless, I highly recommend this film, and would dare to label it an ""instant classic"" of Japanese films.",1220054400,,1399,4.651821862348178

I wanted to like this movie.  I was so looking forward to receiving it and finally getting to watch it.

But I admit that I am somewhat disappointed.

On the plus side is the music, which is gorgeous and suitably epic; the cinematography, which is lovely to look at; and the costuming, which is rich and interesting.

On the downside is just about everything else.  The acting isn't atrocious but it is stagey and overdramatic in an uncomfortably laughable way.  I don't expect Kurosawa-level direction but even half-Kurosawa-level would have been better because the direction had odd transitions that had me scratching my head.  The insertion of Kulan, a warrior girl, is a prime example.  She comes into the story a little after the halfway point and she then takes up an important spot in the story.  So important that she supplants the subplot about Temujin and his son, Jochi, that should have been delved into far more considering what transpires in the last 10 minutes of the movie.

I don't want to harp on the negatives because it isn't a bad movie.  In fact, it had the potential to be a very good movie, but the pieces just never quite come together.  This was a story about the man who would become Genghis Khan and all I could think was, ""Boy, he was kinda lame,"" which I doubt was the objective of the filmmakers.

Overall, it is a solid 3-star.  It isn't bad; but it isn't great either.  Basically, it was potential missed.",1220054400,2,1781,5.110726643598616
3506338,4,B001C4ZQ9I,"This is a remarkable independent Japanese movie that was officialy selected to be showed at several independent world film festivals, such as Antalya Golden Orange, Moscow International, and Bangkok. The film is obviously in Japanese, with English subtitles available, and tells the story of Genghis Khan, one of history's greatest rulers, a warrior of a tribe converted to a myth by means of war.
At the beginning it took me a while to get into the story,  but soon I was hooked up by the epic proportions of the drama and at the end I enjoyed the movie very much. The budget for this kind of movies is low, so don't expect the effects of LOTR, or the battle sequences found in Braveheart, although the DRAMA within the movie remains pristine. The acting is quite remarkable and the costume design is outstanding.
Recommended for independent film lovers and excellent for those learning Japanese :-)",1220054400,,900,4.8441558441558445
3506339,3,B001C4ZQ9I,"GENGHIS KHAN: to the ENDS OF THE EARTH AND SEA (2007, Aoki Okami: chi hate um tsukiru made) is a Japanese produced epic directed by Shinichiro Sawai. The film is a massive 136 minute film, but with its title, it can be at least two 136 minutes films. The title gives the impression that this is a completed tale in the life of Khan but the film has barely scratched its surface. I've read that there is a sequel in the works but it all depended on how well it did, and judging from its box-office take, it didn't do well enough to justify a sequel.

The film chronicles the life of Temujin/Genghis, (played by Takashi Sorimachi) who rises to power from a clan leader to Khan. Temujin (soon to be known as Genghis Khan) is the offspring of a tribal leader who has to live in poverty after his father dies and the tribe abandons his family. Mongolia was a place of feuding tribes, and the film's main premise revolves around his dream of unifying the Mongols. He shares this dream with his best friend, Jamuqa (Yusuke Hirayama), but unfortunately, as fate dictates--there can only be one Khan.

The film's outcome is quite predictable, and to its credit, the film tries to focus on Genghis' obsession in finding the secrets of his birth, his strained relationship with his son, (played by Kenichi Matsuyama) and his conquest of other tribes. The film was shot mostly in Mongolia, and the all-Japanese cast is better suited to play Mongols than the cast in the U.S.-made John Wayne film a few years ago. Takashi Sorimachi struggles with his role at times, he seems to be trying too hard to convince us that he is an awesome, ruthless warrior. The great cinematography helps the film's proceedings and the dialogue somewhat resembles classic chambara films. The all-Japanese supporting cast is decent; with some hints of human angst, but they act like Japanese, never as Mongols. There is a very familiar face in beautiful Koyuki (Last Samurai) and I thought she was a welcome sight.

Now, for a grand spectacle such as this, one will expect quite a lot of warfare. There are quite a good number of them; and most are executed with a very limited use of CGI. The film is a nostalgic treat to the films of old; they use real Mongolian soldiers and real horses in those sequences. They spared no expense, and I thought this was an impressive move by the director; too bad it was too little and too late. The battle scenes turn out very mediocre, the bloodless battles fail to provide intensity and excitement. The musical score also seems out of place, Temujin's conquests were murderous and bloody, not something as glorious as the musical track emulated. The film gets redundant after you see soldiers running around under the cover of CGI dirt and dust.

Sawai tries his very best to keep the film at a certain pace, but unfortunately, in doing so, he fails to provide certain qualities that make a grand spectacle. There really is nothing memorable in the scenes, and the direction seems rushed. Sawai was overreaching in his ambition that it really felt like the film only wants to cover enough about Temujin then he moves to the next stop. Temujin's second wife/warrior (played by Korean actress Ara) is severely underdeveloped, and the familiar scene when Temujin and Jamuqa become blood brothers lacked precise exposition. The film seemed incoherent at times, Khan's life seems too hurried and unfocused due to Sawai's rather lackluster script or maybe its budget. I also caught some lazy bits of poor editing.

My knowledge of Khan's history may be a bit blurry but I very much doubt that this is an efficient biography of Genghis Khan. The film would have been a spectacular epic, but with its abstinence from bloody warfare, it is just an old-fashioned epic that will only be good in a ""made for TV"" movie. The film had a lot of ambition, but it was very obvious that it had a very limited budget, and offers nothing we haven`t all seen before; and done better. Too bad, real people in an epic battle field sequence would have been very exciting and a great trip to nostalgia lane, ""Genghis Khan: to the Ends of the Earth and Sea"" falters. This version seems a little incomplete and unfinished, and definitely forgettable.

Recommended with caution, RENT IT first [3- Stars]

3506341,3,B001C4ZQ9I,"This movie was made by Japanese.

The acting is average.

The battle scenes give mixed result. On one hand, it's exciting with real stunts, no CGI. For example, horsemen and horses were beaten and felt to the ground. On the other hand, the sword fighting scenes are messy and not engaging. It's very difficult to see the movements of the fighters. It might be because of bad directing and unskilled actors. Consequently, these scenes are not interesting as those of Hollywood or Chinese movies.

The drama's element is okay.

I saw it in a theater and cannot for the life of me remember the somewhat unusual title.  All I know is that it was not this film, which is quite beautiful in terms of its cinematography and other technical elements, but just isn't as compelling a story.  I also get a bit nervous about recommending historical films of this type because they often take great liberties with the truth (which I know can be a common problem in film).

3506345,5,B001C4ZQ9I,"While there are no movies without faults, this is choice feeding for a battle bird.  During the last year I have viewed at least four versions of the story of Temujin and this is the best I have found.

The faults.  English subtitles and long.  There are no written histories which tell of all of the exploits of the great conqueror, least of all brutally accurate ones.  Some artistic license is given to not offend the censor.

The accolades.

First is the location.  Actually filmed in the correct region of the world, not England or the American southwest.  I loved watching the background.  I replayed some scenes just to concentrate on the background.

Second, is the action and accouterments.  With a few minor nit picking points of Mongol horse archery, the strategy, tactics, and weapons were very close to as described in period texts and archeological dig findings.  The scene of thousands of the best medium cavalry in history of the world clashing was without a doubt the best special effects I have seen since watching Avatar.

Third, the acting and directing.  It has been said that no man is a villain in his own eyes.  The complexity of Temujin is rivaled only by the complexity of the attempt to bring a foreign (or ancient) culture to life to be understood at least partially in the short space of three hours.  Temujin has to come out showing the contradictions of choices made while the director has to make sure that the actors around the leads are portraying the culture in which the decisions are based.  While I detest having to read sub-titles, keeping the language without overdubbing is an effective way to induce the opening of the cultural bias in the viewers.",1320451200,4,1690,4.72945205479452

Genghis Khan is portrayed as a complex man - honorable but with a temper. Like the story of the Mongol empire, the movie isn't just about big battles, but how Genghis Khan was able to unite his conquered enemies into a greater force rather than plundering their lands.

This is a Japanese film, and the movie has a Japanese feel to it. The language spoke is not Japanese. Some of the cultural traits (excessive asking for forgiveness, bonzai-style chants, etc.) really seem more Japanese than Mongol. It would have been more appropriate to give the film more a Mongol flavor. Despite this, it overall feels like an epic period drama.

3506355,5,B001C4ZQ9I,"The history and legend of the rise of first Mongolian emperor Genghis Khan is told beautifully here in ""Genghis Khan: To the Ends of the Earth and Sea"" (AKA ""Aoki kami: chi hate umi tsukiru made"" or ""The Blue Wolf: To the Ends of the Earth and Sea""), a Japanese-Mongolian co-production. This dramatically epic film presents Genghis Khan's story from birth to conquest of China (ending as his soldiers approach the Great Wall, as a warning for those seeking that part of the story), depicting a difficult childhood as a nomadic tribesman with an unclear lineage and the forging of a love and a friendship that would play important roles in his struggle to unite the Mongolian people. Focusing more on the development of Genghis Khan's character, portrayed here as a strong warrior tempered by a belief in loyalty to friends and respect for women, there is less time spent on battle action and more on relationships, betrayals, lessons, and emotions. It's actually a nice change from most historical, battle-themed epics in this regard, but there is still violence and action to be found, as one would expect. And on top of all that, there is the female soldier character of Kulan (slightly reminiscent of China's Mulan, except that she also becomes Khan's lady on the side), played by a gorgeous actress named Ara, whose beauty is reason enough to see this flick!

Highly recommended if you are interested in an engaging depiction of the early years and rise to power of Genghis Khan (called Temjin for most of the film, as he is declared Genghis Khan close to the end), though understand that the film is based on historical-fiction novels and I believe little is still truly known about Khan's early life. I'm not sure if any of the issue of Khan's unclear lineage is based on known facts (probably something from the novels instead), yet this is an important plot device throughout the film. Nevertheless, it's all good stuff, though aside from the English dubbing option and English subtitles option, this Japanese dialogue, widescreen DVD comes with no extra features, only trailers for other Funimation releases.",1235433600,,2117,4.91340782122905
3506356,5,B001C4ZQ9I,"Unlike ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan"", which is boring, unimaginative and slow-moving, this movie is majestic and glorious and its choice of colours is excellent. I enjoy every part of it, both as a spectator and as a martial artist. If there is a secret to Genghis Khan's ability, it is his humanity and willingness to learn from his mistakes. Sir Karl Popper, the great philosopher would have been proud of him for, he believes that progress proceeds by way of ""Conjectures and Refutations"" (this is the title of his masterpiece). There are plenty of examples in the movie that illustrate this greatness of Genghis Khan but because of the exigency of space, I will restrict myself to two. Firstly, when he defeated the lady warrior, he did not take advantage of her as most male warriors of his time would. Instead, he listened patiently to her explanations and then explained that he did not regard women as the spoils of war. Instead, he offerred her a position as one of his warriors. Secondly, when he realised that Joshi was really sick and that he gave instructions to his commanders not to let the enemy know about his predicament and not to worry his father, Genghis Khan's heart immediately melt. In fact, after uniting the Mongols, he used Joshi's ring to release the arrow which will determine his next conquest. Just a slight criticism if I may. The blurb says that Genghis Khan is ""one of history's great rulers"". In fact, he is history's greatest ruler. Unlike Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great, he has never been defeated. He also conquered more land than these two generals. Thus, I feel that this story needs a sequel. It stopped after Genghis Khan united all the Mongols under his banner. But even given this slight misgiving, this is still a fantastic movie. I highly recommend it to all fans of Genghis Khan.",1232409600,3,1838,4.728971962616822
3506357,1,B001C4ZQ9I,"This movie was a total waste of money and time. The costumes were terrible, the acting was worse and the script was pathetic!! A lot of people seem to like it, but I have no idea why. This movie produces realism at about the same level as an Audie Murphy western. Audie Murphy is a Hero, and I mean him no disrespect, but the 50's westerns like he was in are far from realistic... like this movie. If it was possible for the dead to come back, I'm sure Genghis Kahn would have been back already to tear the entire crew of this film apart for portraying him as a pansy. Horrible, horrible movie!!!
Mongol, The rise of Genghis Khan was better than this and if you want to see a Genghis Khan movie, I suggest you see that instead. I believe that one could have been much better done though too, but no where near as bad as this!! That is unless you enjoy loops of horses being tripped to fill in for the lack of any battle that should have happened.
Unless of course this movie was supposed to be a comedy. I have to admit I laughed real hard for about twenty minutes of this film at how ridiculous it was.

The film manages to cover a vast timeline, and other than the obvious budget constraints succeeds as an engrossing if not sweepingly grand entertainment.  The acting is hard to gauge because of the language and sometimes I could tell the subtitles weren't relaying the exact sentiment being displayed in a scene. Also the production values are little clean considering the Nomadic lifestyle the film depicts and the battle and attack scenes while effective feel minimalistic.  My only major problem with this effort is the anemic score which fails to convey the emotion contained in many of the scenes and is overused throughout.  There are other bigger budget versions of this mans story to be found, but this one has a grounded narrative and appealing cast that make it easy to sit through.",1227139200,,970,4.825301204819277

Visually, the picture often pops with life across the screen - making me wish I'd had the opportunity to see it at the cinema.

The action is filmed in the classic style - brutal, cinematic, but with sweep and edited tightly almost to a fault - neat, tidy and too perfect.

While the film may put off some westerners looking more for a History Channel treatment, most fans of Asian cinema will recognize - and appreciate - the styles associated with more familiar Asian epics which, for me, is a marvelous way of telling this particular story.

I was really hoping that ""Genghis Khan"", would be a film in similar style to ""300"", or perhaps an Asian ""Braveheart"". While ""Khan"" is beautifully shot, I felt the fighting sequences were a little flat, and I had a very hard time rooting for the Mongol leader. I did like the aspects where Khan was trying to understand where he came from, and the dynamic with his son and family wasn't bad, but it wasn't really what I was hoping for. The whole film kind of felt like a ""paint by numbers"" epic, shot and presented by professionals, but lacking ""heart""? (Not sure if that makes sense?) I appreciated what the film makers were trying to do, but the whole experience just falls kind of flat.",1221696000,,859,4.620915032679738
3506367,4,B001C4ZQ9I,"It's clear from the start that this movie has high ambitions.  And while it mostly succeeds, there are some things which hold it back from greatness.

Let's start with the good.

It's an engaging well-made movie.  I was expecting more of a focus on Temujin (Khan) as a warrior.  And there are plenty of well done battle scenes.  However the focus is not solely about him as a fighter but also his development as a person as he learns from his past experiences.  The interaction of Temujin with various family members is also interesting to watch.  The changes you see in him as he interacts with his son Jochi and his mother Hoelun delve deeper than the typical warrior-hero stereotypes.

There were some very interesting support characters introduced as well.  Each character brings out a different aspect of Temujin through their interaction with him.  Whether it is his attitude toward women, family, or outsiders, each of these characters has a role in the development of Temujin as a person.

Now on to the not-so-good - character development and pacing.

The emphasis is squarely on Temujin, much to the neglect of the supporting characters.  Although the supporting characters are generally interesting and necessary to the overall plot, they don't get developed as fully as they could.  A character will be introduced, something conflict will arise, and then the character just disappears for large chunks of the movie.  Then suddenly the character reappears, and whatever conflict occurred is quickly and not quite convincingly wrapped up.  This is especially noticeable with scenes involving Temujin and Jochi.  Most support characters could have been so much deeper had more time been devoted to them.  This problem with character development is also a contributing factor to the overall pacing of the plot.  The intial scenes with Temujin as a youth feel a bit rushed, then there are sections in the middle which feel a bit slow.  Then the end is rushed again.  It felt like several plot elements could have been addressed in greater depth and some could have been skipped completely.

Overall there were a lot of good pieces, they just weren't all assembled together in the end.  Borderline between 3.5-4 stars.  I'll give it 4.",1221523200,,2241,4.975741239892184
3506368,4,B001C4ZQ9I,"I liked this movie. Yes, it was made by the Japanese but unlike others reviewers I don't see the problem with that. That said, gestures and other mannerisms were culturally Japanese, but it didn't hurt the movie. As a long-time martial artist I can say that the fighting techniques, especially the sword work, was very Japanese. Chinese sword play does not look like Samurai sword play.

But the story, though historically off a bit, was well told, the acting was fine and the spectacle was, well, spectacular.

It is the first DVD I've seen where actors were not listed.

It's not that bad. A good one for a rainy Sunday afternoon.",1221523200,,632,4.675675675675675
3506369,2,B001C4ZQ9I,"Being this is over a 2hr movie and the nice marketing done with the cover, I had high hopes.

But those hopes were dashed about half way through the movie when I started asking myself where was this story going?

First off, you don't hear the words ""Genghis Khan"" till the very end and only once. About 2/3 of the way through my wife asked me if the main character is Genghis, because there is no explanation how his name changes or how he gets the name we are all familiar with.

About 2/3 of the way through a new character emerges; a female warrior who seems to be having an affair with Genghis. Where did this come from? The scene is brief but handled as if the characters have a long standing affair with each other. It was very confusing.

The biggest fault with this movie is it makes Genghis out to be a soft-hearted, merciful character. Uh, no! Why try and change history? Was this a simple effort on the producers to make a ""sympathetic"" character? Well if failed on so many levels as the character wasn't consistent with the decisions pressed upon him or speeches he makes during the movie of his goals and motivations.

Lastly, there is no explanation why Genghis chooses to attack the Chinese. And the movie ends with him charging the Great Wall. . .no epilogue to inform those unfamiliar with history if this was his last battle or not. The movie leaves you completely and utterly sitting on a cliff hanger that goes unresolved in this 2hr+ show.

Yes, it has some beautiful panoramic shots and brief wide-screen battle scenes, but it was in such small doses that it is overshadowed by the negatives of this movie.

I even lent the DVD to a guy at work where there is very few Asian movies he doesn't watch or like. He didn't like this either.

What was so frustrating is that a friendship is built up, the love between Genghis and his wife is built up, and other events occur that have so much potential, but the movie didn't know what direction to go with it all. It was if the movie wanted to focus on his accomplishments, but kept getting sidetracked by his family struggles. . .the same struggles that seemed to appear out of nowhere and other struggles that go unresolved and no mention of them later in the movie.

OVERALL: Watch the Hallmark made movie ""Attila"" if you want a dose of a Asian, historical, conquerer story. You'll be better off than watching this confusing piece of poorly edited, failed potential.",1221436800,,2435,4.503401360544218
3506370,4,B001C4ZQ9I,"Creating a magnificently filmed biographical epic of the rise of the great Genghis Khan is a daring adventure in film history. Although the film has the look of success, bringing the Khan to life is only partially realized. Part myth, part history, Genghis Kahn steadily rises to power, making bold battle decisions and faltering rarely. What is missing from this solid film is a core of passion. Too many scenes drag.

Director Shinichiro Sawai wanted to be circumspect in telling the story of Temujin, who finally unites the Mongols to claim the title Genghis Khan. But in presenting Temujin as a man growing into leadership, Sawai has to evade some truths. The Temujin of this film, played by Takashi Sorimachi, is thoughtful and honorable, almost to a fault, a reputation at odds with the one of history.

Toward the end of the film, Khan tells Kulan, his female soldier, that blood must be spilled to open borders, a seeming contradiction that is sensible to him. Indeed, having a whole world without borders is perhaps a euphemism for total world domination. Another omission from history is that the Khan left his DNA all over Asia and Europe yet none of this is part of the story. In fact, the movie implies that Temujin is faithful to the one wife. It's little telling points like these that make the film less effective. Having a hero without warts is terribly unrealistic and unreasonable.

The film is episodic in nature, presenting key moments in Temujin's life, showing what manner of man he is all along his life's journey. Unusually kind and considerate toward his women, Temujin, in fact, reveals a major life issue: whether he is truly a child of his father and the great blue wolf or if he is blood issue from a warring tribe, of which one member took his mother to wife for a while.

History repeats itself when his own wife is abducted and recaptured by Temujin, only to discover she is pregnant. Is this baby his or the child of the enemy? When he captures the girl soldier, she insists on death rather than be taken as a spoil of war. Temujin shows his magnaminity by allowing her to become one of his soldiers, then later she invites him to take her as concubine. The director chooses to depict Temujin as an equal rights proponent when history would most likely dispute this.

His loyalty to his childhood friend is the most telling episode of Temujin's character. The final scene between them is painfully slow, again to reveal the inner turmoil that Temujin feels.

The longest drawn out scene is the naming of Temujin as the great Genghis Khan, a scene that went on and on and on. In contrast, the final scene is the impending attack upon the Great Wall of China and the Jin Dynasty with the suggestion of extending the kingdom to the ends of the Earth and Sea.

Even with the film's omissions and perhaps slight shifting of truth, ""Genghis Kan: To the ends of the Earth and Sea"" is a rewarding movie experience. The vistas of Mongolia alone are enough to see this epic film.",1221350400,59,3003,4.6440677966101696
3506371,5,B001C4ZQ9I,"I thought this film was very well done and done in the best tradition of Epic Japanese Cinema.  The film is a Japanese - Mongolian coproduction and a very good one.  It goes from the beginnings of Genghis Khan's life to the point where he is to invade China.  Along the way we learn about his life and the nomadic culture he lived in.  The kidnapping and rape of women is an interesting one which causes countless heartbreak for the women who can be rejected and if there is a child, death to the child they bear.  I found that interesting and sad.  I think it was a very difficult culture for people to live in but what the Mongols were able to do is amazing.",1221350400,,660,4.198412698412699
3506372,2,B001C4ZQ9I,"I have not yet seen the OTHER Genghis Khan movie - Mongol. But from what I've just sat through, I think I might like it better. This was one talky movie.

And it really lost me with all the stops and starts.  You have major plot climaxes every so often, but the seemingly natural climax (the titular character's rise to the status of Genghis) is twenty minutes before the end of the movie.

There is a heart breaking coda, and a five minute bit of exposition that finally lets Khan supplant his Mother's near movie-long narration, hers mostly about who is whose baby.

There is a lot of talking. Did I mention that?

The CGI is not all that convincing. Way too much blood spray that looks less than convincing because it looks more like a sudden ""poof"" of red than anything actually human produced. Maybe they changed this for US release? But the augmented battle scenes look pretty good for the most part. Only once or twice was I pulled out of the film by distracting battle shots.

But the weak script, which even features a female soldier named Kulan (Disney might have a lawsuit here) is pure revisionist high compression movie silliness.

The performances are from really good to fairly weak. And whatever you do, you should never listen to the English dub. It is not good at getting across the emotions of the actors, and makes those performances seem strange at times.

Other than some anime previews, there are zero bonus features. No making of, nothing.

Some good performances, weak script, beautiful images, midling CGI, zero bonus features. For folks who want their historical films inaccurate and overtly melodramatic.",1221350400,5,1632,4.75886524822695
3506373,4,B001C4ZQ9I,"Take a ruthless murderer, romantisize the story, put in some subplots about love and devotion to the family, set it in a sweeping drama with violence and spectacular scenery.

Thats ""Genghis Khan: To the Ends of the Earth and Sea"", but it could also be ""Chisum"", just replace Genghis with Billy the Kid and you're there, and since John Wayne played the great Khan in ""The Conquerers"" he could be in both flicks.

I've been watching a lot of Westerns recently, and I really was struck by some of the similarities between this Japanese tale of the Mongol warlord and some classic Hollywood horse operas.  The scenery in this movie should get star billing, just as the Monument Valley starred in John Ford films.  This isn't a bad thing, because the setting in Ghengis Kahn is a visual treat.

I was expecting more of an overview or documentary type of film from the scope of the title, but it focuses on the rise of Ghengis, his early loyalties, loves and struggle to unite the Mongol tribes.  I found myself waiting for the terrible conquerer of history to come through, but much like the Hollywood version of William Bonney's life, the treatment here is pretty sympathetic.

I watched using the subtitles, because the sound in the dubbed version was basic stereo rather than the 5.1 surround that the subtitled track offers.

This wasn't a bad movie at all, but I don't think it will stick in my memory for too long.  If the swords and bows had been replaced with sixguns and Winchesters, It would blend right in with many other films I've watched.  A good, enjoyable effort, but not the super epic that the title seems to promise.",1221264000,,1631,4.631944444444445
3506374,4,B001C4ZQ9I,"As a member of the general audience of film goers I like to be entertained and dazzled with brilliance, not BS.  For me, films that have artsy elements and cinematography are typically lost on the general audience as are films that dazzle with special effects and visuals only.  That said, I watched Genghis Kahn wandering if I was going to be shown an art-house love story or a war movie; I got both.

Genghis Kahn follows strictly the birth, youth, and rise of Temujin (Genghis Kahn) and NOT the rule of the Mongol Empire or their conquering all of Asia.  The name Genghis Kahn first appears in the last twenty minutes of a movie that is over two hours long.  Know this when you watch the movie as myself and other viewers in the room were puzzled how the movie relates to Genghis Kahn since the name doesn't appear till the end.

Regardless of the quasi-misnomer, ""GK"" is a fairly beautiful and fairly accurate tale of the rise of one of the most effective military leaders in Asia.  The actual story of Genghis Kahn's birth and upbringing is somewhat unknown; the only primary source of information regarding Temujin's origins and youth is in The Secret History of the Mongols, a literary source written after Genghis' death by an anonymous author.  This source is more in line with folklore and poetry than an actual historical document similar to the Llyiad although the story is nonetheless appealing.

Despite historical ambiguity, GK stays fairly true to The Secret History of the Mongols although they take some artistic liberties to compress the story and make it more appealing although revealing some would have spoilers.

The story itself is fairly compelling; a child is born of an outsider woman to a nomadic nobleman and grows up trying to unite a politically unstable region filled with tribal conflict.  The story follows Temujin from birth to his arranged wedding, his conflicts with neighboring tribes while trying to unite them, his rise to Genghis Kahn and just up until the invasion of China.

The downside to the story is how slowly the movie progresses, some scenes of staring and observation going on far too long almost akin to a bad episode of Dragon Ball Z.  Many of the scenes could have easily been condensed to make the movie an even two hours and some of the scenes less cumbersome to watch.

The visuals were fairly nice with minimal computer animation, which was used to make battles seem as though there were more horsemen.  The majority of the visuals was the fairly stunning landscape of the Mongolian grasslands.  One of the more odd visuals was blood spurting which, in typical Japanese fashion, spurted out like a oil drill hitting pay dirt.  While I'm not much for fanboy service, the blood spurting genuinely made me laugh.  Meanwhile, the music was very compelling but not soothing enough to make you wanna feel asleep.

The one thing visually that disappointed me was the lack of battle sequences.  Granted, in a world where we've been treated to the beautiful battle sequences (It feels ominous saying that) from Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, and Braveheart, we've become accustomed to seeing spectacular visuals depicting battle, however, the battles in GK were waay too short or vaguely hinted at.  I can understand if the budget didn't allow but they when a person purchases a movie on the greatest conqueror in Asia (next to Google and Michael Phelps) that viewer typically expects to see riders charging into battle giving out numerous Howard Dean battle cries (We're going to Mongolia then on to the Tatars and then the Great Wall!!  Yeeeeeeaaaaaaaw!!) and that happened but very briefly.

If anything, this is a political romance film and NOT a war film.  The balance between war, romance and peace reminds me of the John Adams series (great series BTW); against the backdrop of the American Revolution, the Quasi-War, and the War of 1812 but focused more on politics and some romance over the battles.  This is not to say the story is bad but it is a little misgiving.

All in all, this movie is worthy of renting and possibly purchasing as long as you realize this is NOT a war film.  I am glad I bought it and will gladly display it amongst my collection but under the ""political drama"" collection rather than next to Braveheart.",1221004800,2,4286,4.780189959294437
3506375,4,B001C4ZQ9I,"This is a Japanese / Mongolian co-production, filmed entirely in Mongolia, and featuring some very beautiful scenery.  It covers the life of Genghis Khan starting from childhood, and going through his eventual unification of all the Mongolian tribes under his leadership.  As a boy, his father is killed, and his family abandoned as someone else takes charge of his tribe.  Over the years, he slowly builds alliances and conquers other small tribes in his area, building up power.  The portrayal of Genghis is very favorable, showing him as a fair man, a victim of circumstances on the Mongolian plains where constant warfare is the norm.  He always holds onto the dream of uniting everyone so that all may live in peace.  His character in the film is quite likable, which was the key to my enjoyment of the movie.

The film is in Japanese, with English subtitles.  You can also choose to listen to the English dub.  The dubbing is fair, a bit emotionless and ""official"" sounding.  At age 15 or so, Genghis unfortunately winds up being dubbed with an adult man's voice, which is rather distracting.  The dialog is quite simplistic, telling the story in basic fashion.  The acting is a bit overwrought at times, but this seems to be the norm for most Asian action stuff I see.  Probably the movie's biggest problem is that Genghis is never portrayed as taking part in the battles, he directs the action from afar.  So the battles are nothing but groups of men on horseback riding into each other.  There's no skill or valor displayed by the protagonist.  Also, the movie does drag considerably towards the end.  The coronation ceremony where he is declared ruler of all Mongolia goes on too long, and the dialog veers into absurdity at this point as well.  Portrayed as a down-to-earth, normal guy throughout the movie, he suddenly starts speaking in quasi-religious verbiage, giving speeches which seem completely out of character.

Overall, I quite enjoyed this.  The protagonist is a very likable character and watching him rise from a child to the eventual ruler of Mongolia kept my interest very nicely.  The film is certainly not without problems, but in my opinion the good outweighs the bad and makes for an overall favorable experience.",1221004800,,2244,4.8680738786279685
3506376,2,B001C4ZQ9I,"This Japanese production covers Genghis Khan's life from birth through the establishment of his empire. Sadly, it feels as long as Khan's reign (which would be a bad thing for someone watching it)and is contrived with a plot that might have worked in the 50's but just doesn't play well in the 21st century. I didn't find the film very believable and while I don't mind the fact that all the actors speak Japanese (after all it was made for a Japanese audience originally and American films commit the same sin all the time--making Germans, the French and others speak English vs. their native tongue in American movies),it might have been nice to cast the film actors that might have Mongol blood running through their veins. It's not as bad as casting, say, John Wayne as Khan (which WE did)but it isn't quite as believable either.

The production design is quite handsome at times although the film, again, betrays its Japanese origin with many of the costumes and sets looking more like they might have come out of feudal Japan. The cinematography is beautiful looking and the performances solid enough (although I'll admit I found the English dubbed dialogue much inferior in terms of performance when compared to the Japanese version).

If this had been directed by Kurosawa the film might have had more of an epic sweep and grandeur. Director Shinichir Sawai does a solid job with most of the action set pieces but when the action slows down, the film seems stuck in molassess bogging the story down in tedious details. Based on the novel by Seiichi Morimura and adapted by Takehiro Nakajiima and Shoichi Maruyama the film takes a fair amount of liberties with its historical basis based on what I recall from Khan's life. This is a drama however and NOT a documentary and that wouldn't be such a major flaw if not for the sluggish pacing and unconvincing drama on screen.

I'd suggest a rental.",1220745600,2,1902,4.757575757575758
3506377,3,B001C4ZQ9I,I look at this film as a historical film that tells us the story of how Genghis Khan came to be the historical figure that he is.  What I really liked about the movie was the cinematography.  Definitely a well done visual epic tale.  I did learn which is always good for me.  The constant struggle for self acceptance by the main character made the film more enjoyable.  I would not buy the film.  If I were doing research on Genghis Khan and wanted to visually get an idea of what it may have been like to be in Mongolia in the 1200's then this would be an ok film to rent.,1220745600,,574,4.080357142857143
3506378,2,B001C4ZQ9I,"I wanted to like this movie. The cover looked great. Here's what was inside.

There are three ways you can make a movie about Genghis Khan (GK) - either a hagiography, the opposite, or something based on knowable history, warts and all. This is the hagiography, make no mistake about it.

In this version, GK is a sensitive, Western-educated Enlightenment champion of women, whose goal - in his own words near the end of the movie - is to conquer so that trade, cultures and traditions of all peoples, will flourish. It's the most ridiculous scene I've seen on film for a while, even counting Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo. I don't have anything against GK, but such a statement is simply idiotic. And the claims about his efforts to establish equality for all, including women, are mostly made by Mongolian historians and, to my knowledge, are without any supporting evidence whatsoever. So ... bring along many grains of salt.

Which GK is the GK of history? Here, he's a 90's man, missing his woman (""I missed you!"") and loudly lamenting the death of his son, and waging war for the sake of multi-culti. He doesn't take women as spoils of war, unless they insist - insist, I tell you! - on becoming part of his harem (not shown) out of respect and admiration. I don't buy it for a second!

The other side sees him as a genocidal Lothario, killing and pillaging and always keeping the most beautiful women for himself. This view is entirely absent from this movie.

No, he kills to preserve culture! (and trade.)

The plot is interesting, as it deals with tribal warfare, problems of fatherhood and the identification thereof, and the sufferings of women in such a culture. Is his father a hated Merkit? Did he just kill him? And so on. The dialogue is just passable, but my opinion may be due to hearing and reading the English version.

But the cinematography and lighting are pedestrian. The costuming is another problem - the lead actor looks sufficiently conflicted and pained,  but frequently looks lost in costumes or armor which look designed for a much larger person (John Wayne?), an unfortunately comical effect. It may be authentic, but it was a mistake. Some headgear bring to mind Jackie Chan's seal cap in ""First Strike"".

And everything seems too clean - the clothes, the huts, everything. Spotless. It may just be my ignorance of ancient Mongol cleanliness, though. Or propaganda. You decide.

As for the music, the score doesn't fit at all; it is decidedly Western in tone, and at times *really* Western - I mean *cowboy* Western. It's quite a strange mix.

In conclusion, I learned something from this movie - or, rather, from trying to verify how much of it was true - and was quite skeptical of the overall picture. It's probably as ""historical"" as ""Kingdom of Heaven"" or ""JFK"" or ""Harold and Kumar"" - and by that I mean: not too much. I give it two stars for sheer earnestness. It will be interesting to compare this to the upcoming ""Mongol"".",1220313600,7,2976,4.6928982725527835
3506379,4,B001C4ZQ9I,"I went into this film with no preconceived notions of what it would be like.  My experience with Japanese cinema had pretty much been limited to Godzilla movies and martial arts flicks.  So I can say that the overall quality and scope of this film was somewhat surprising, and quite impressive.

The main menu for the film comes up after a single preview that I could not skip nor fast-forward through, no matter what I tried.  I went straight to the beginning of the film, though aside from the usual scene selection, and set-up menu, there appeared to be no additional special features.  A shame, really, as there could have been some very interesting background and behind the scenes features included. Upon pressing play, the movie defaults to Japanese language with easily legible English subtitles.  This is how I watched it.  I did not look to see if there was an alternate dubbed English soundtrack.

The movie actually begins prior to the birth of the child who would someday become Genghis Khan, and covers events in his life leading up to his middle age, and ascension to power.  To be honest, I can't attest to the film's historical accuracy, as my knowledge of Genghis Khan is pretty much limited to the comical twinkie-eating, baseball bat wielding Khan on display in BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE.  That being said, I found the story and narrative to be quite engaging.  The film was a bit slow to get going, but by about a third of the way through, I had come to care about the characters being portrayed, and gladly stuck with it until the end.

There are several epic battle scenes, all beautifully staged and photographed.  I imagine there might have been some CGI involved, but if there was, it wasn't the least bit detectable.  The actual fighting was shot in the way that I prefer - none of this ultra close-up, quick edit, can't-really-tell-what's-going-on stuff.  You saw all the moves and counter moves quite clearly.  And the blood.  Sure there were a few instances of blood spurting from a wound after the blow was delivered.  But it was not overdone as it is in so many other movies of this type.  And I could be wrong, but I don't recall seeing any blatant dismemberments or decapitations, so if you get off on that sort of thing, look elsewhere.

In all, a well crafted film, with a solid (sometimes even inspiring) story, beautifully photographed, and well-acted.  Perhaps not destined to become a classic, but a nearly great movie nonetheless.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoy this type of film.",1220227200,,2541,4.7272727272727275

8286129,5,B001C4ZQ9I,"I cannot remember seeing a better, more beautiful dvd....Acting suburb...photography, beyond improvement...story [as I know of the actual of Kahn] very close to actual history....each scene flows seamlessly into the next...can be the Historic ""Date Movie"" yes, she will llke it after being coxed or bribed into watching it because it is a great love story with sacrifice of ego and human understanding....there is nothing not to like about this dvd [unless you are one of  those few movie reviewers who deliberately go against common opinion just to attract attention to themselves].  This is an Epic  Production without a flaw. stands equally with ""Rashomon"" as Japan's greatest (this one is broad of scope while the other is a tight interplay of the three central characters)....everyone I show it to wants a copy for their collection [serious cinema people]  in many ways it is a shame that the American movie going public d is denied seeing films like this because of some unknown hold the studios have,  that forces the theater owners into accepting the junk we have every week..(with few exceptions).  for those who thought of Mongolia as one never ending desert this will surprise them with views of green hills and liveable pastures...as they say "" TV has never lived up to it potential for.educating""  so ""Genghis Khan: To the Ends of the Earth"" does its bit in raising the level of expectations. of the movie going public ,,,if they can ever have the chance to see it.  Buy it because it is a family dvd, showing what standing by the family [clan or country]
means,... your kids will be better for watching it with you.",1397865600,,1629,4.855595667870036
