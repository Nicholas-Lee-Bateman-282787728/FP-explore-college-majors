7960867,4,B000065AYQ,"Brain Powered is an okay animated series with some strange turns of plot (it seems a matter of course that mecha appear in the series - though it doesn't make too much sense :P). It certianly isn't a Marcoss or Gundam ripoff, but it isn't entirly successful in shaking off the giant robots wars so common in anime.

The soundtrack is really good, its been done none other than the famed, Yoko Kanno. Kanno really hits another one out of the park with this one.",1130976000,,460,4.411764705882353
7960868,4,B000065AYQ,"I know Amazons reviewer hates this series, but I find it entertaining. I know the story doesnt really go anywhere, and some of the Mech designs are poor, but I just enjoy watching it. I don't find the characters boring at all, I do find them a little retarted at times. The Isami family is a little wacked in the head, the Mom sleeps around the daughter is a psyco the son seems pretty normal and the dad is just weird. If you like L-Gaim or Gundam, or other war based mech series you should find this worth a watch at least.",1053561600,,525,4.1568627450980395
7960869,5,B000065AYQ,"I'm a big fan of all types of mecha anime, but this one has to be my favorite now. It has pretty much everything I could want in a mecha show. Fans of Five Star Stories and Heavy Metal L.Gaim will love this.
Departure from the Ocean Depths (B-): Hime recieves her very own Brain while Yuu contemplates live on Earth.
Fated Reunion (B+): Yuu escapes Orphen to find Hime and tries to break into a research lab.

At the Port of Call (B): KD tries to infiltrate Novis Noah and Kanon becomes more attached to Russ Lemberg.
Johnathan's Sword (B+): Mr. Mohammad comes to buy the Novis Noah and Johnathan Glenn holds the ship's crew hostage.
The music of Brain Powered alone is worth watching this show. The animation is a tad dated, but still watchable. Extras on the second disc include Textless Opening and Closing. The insert in the package contains a brief synphosis of the series.
Overall, this is a great start to a highly intriguing plot that will get way better as the show goes on. Plus, 9 episodes on 2 discs is a good deal. Highly recommended to all mecha fans, old or young.",1035331200,,1617,4.522184300341297
