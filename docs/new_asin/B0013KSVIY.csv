8251588,1,B0013KSVIY,"Was misleaded, thought the DVD was in the same series as the Nicolas Cage Ghost Rider.  I watch for about three minutes, then simply threw the stupid disc into the garbage.",1462060800,,172,4.548387096774194
8251589,3,B0013KSVIY,"More of the same. Fun to watch if you haven't already seen any of these videos. All videos in this series are very similar and if you already have one, perhaps you don't need another.",1424304000,2,183,4.257142857142857
8251590,1,B0013KSVIY,"I opened this movie and to my surprise (and disappointment) this is not a sequel to ""Ghost Rider"" at all, it is a 'B' rated film that someone made by attaching their camera to a motorcycle and riding (like a nut) around in European countries dodging traffic.  It has no plot or make any sense at all, that I can see.  I wish now that I had not opened the package and returned it instead.",1378252800,10,387,4.1466666666666665
8251591,5,B0013KSVIY,"This particular DVD had a lot of interesting footage to it in comparison to others.  Some of the footage isn't of the highest quality like the ride in the Netherlands; however, it is still mind blowing to watch.  This might be one of my favorite Ghost Rider dvds.",1357862400,2,263,4.458333333333333
