8442644,3,B004V2FU2G,"astik is good film to watch but it's a repetition of most of Amitabh's performances where he is always the angry man whose family gets murdered in his early childhood, and later seek revenge once he finds the killer and sometimes reunites with his loved ones when we assume they're still dead! Nevertheless, I enjoy Amitabh's wonderful acting because his appeal is simply unique whether it's drama, action or comedy. As for Nastik, it talks about Shankar's journey as an atheist when he renounces his faith in the gods after the horrible deaths of his family by the evil slumlord Tiger. Blirin and Gori were the perfect companions for Shankar as they earn their living through stealing from the rich until they encounter Tiger, and discover his heinous crimes against innocents so they fight him.",1305849600,,796,4.9037037037037035
