2596764,5,B000G0O5CI,"This is a user-friendly DVD, highly recommended for those of us trying to shed some pounds/ tone up.

1. It is comprehensive i.e. one can just follow the routimes in this through the week. I would however recommend a Stretch DVD for one day a week

2. It can be done in the confines of the home, minimum extra equipment required, minimum space required

3. It is relatively short, fits into daily schedule

4. It is do-able by the ""average joe"". There is no complicated choreography. The routines are easy to learn. I would however recommend that one sees the DVD in full before attempting the first time. I would also say that it is tougher than it seems

5. It can be done by both gents and ladies

6. I would recommend that 6-times weekly option, but other options are also okay.

Good luck - Abi",1171929600,11,799,4.394557823129252

This video does a nice job of mixing things up, and despite the relative simplicity of the exercises, I always finish feeling I've gotten a good workout.",1171843200,11,301,4.574074074074074
2596766,5,B000G0O5CI,"The workouts are non-sense weight lifting and Interval Training. The abs workout is excellent. Beginners and Intermediates will benenfit the most from this program.

It is perfect, as I am 48 yrs old and hate the jumping on a carpet.  The weight training, like another reviewer wrote, switch exercises for the same body part; push-up instead of chest press, etc.  I was doing the Body for Life program, and wanted a fitness routine that I could kind of model after that, every other day weight/cardio, but with a DVD instead of on my own.",1170892800,7,514,4.214285714285714

It incorporates all aspects of the ABS Diet, and guides you thru a few strenuous routines. You can set up your own schedule and as long as you stick to it (and amend your routine as needed) you will find this a useful and worthwhile workout DVD. I bought it, and I'm glad I own it - but I'm even more happy to say that this is one I actually use!",1167782400,21,489,4.0
2596769,5,B000G0O5CI,"This is a great workout DVD. I really like the aerobic ""speed"" workout, which consists of scientifically-proven workouts in which you jog in place for basically 25 minutes, interspersed with 30, 45, or 60-second speed sections (jump rope, jumping jacks, etc.) [it has been shown that alternating intensity is the optimal fat burning way to exercise]. It really works your body in the optimal way, and only takes 25 minutes to do. I find it very helpful for someone to take me through that, because he shows you just how to work out to burn the most fat. Great stuff.",1163376000,10,566,4.67
2596770,5,B000G0O5CI,"The CafeWriter obviously wasn't watching the DVD very carefully. There IS diet information on this DVD. Plus, the swiss ball is only needed if you want to do the Intermediate level. There is a woman in the back who shows you how to do exercises without the swiss ball (beginner's level). Not all of the exercises require that you use a swiss ball. Plus, it's great to see both levels at once, so you can alternate between the two depending on the difficulty level at which you want to perform an exercise. You can also select your plan for 3, 4, 5, or 6 days a week (through the Weekly Schedules menu). This DVD offers a lot more options and customization than the Vol 1 DVD.

This DVD is a great supplement to the book, which explains the plan in detail and provides suggestions for exercises. If you do not already know about the plan, I suggest buying the book first (or in addition to this DVD).",1160179200,16,899,4.383233532934132
2596771,3,B000G0O5CI,"I was expecting something along the lines of the book ""The Abs Diet Get Fit, Stay Fit Plan,"" which offered a lot of variety. This is partly why I'm so disappointed. This appears to be ""Abs Diet"" in name only.

First off, all fitness DVDs should state up front what equipment you will need. This one does not. You'll need a mat, a pair of dumbbells, and for intermediate/advanced exercisers, a fitness ball to use as a weight bench.

Unlike the previous DVD, there are is no diet information - just workouts divided by frequency (3 to 6 times a week), and then by level. Regardless of which level you choose, you'll get the same thing: a 3-minute warm-up (static stretches and very light cardio), an abs segment, an intermediate/advanced weights circuit routine, and a cardio workout. The only difference in the entire thing is in the abs workout segment: beginners do 10 minutes, advanced do 12.

The exercises in the 25-minute circuit routine are straightforward, fairly standard (chest presses, shoulder presses, kickbacks, lunges, squats, crunches, etc.), and the same for ALL levels. Beginners will have to watch for modifications, even if they chose the ""Beginner"" menu item. Overall it flows well, and though the music is still a little annoying, it is not as bad as the first DVD.

For cardio, there's a 25-minute ""speed interval"" workout - a high/low intensity mix of jogging, straddle hops, squat jumps, jumping jacks, knee lifts, etc. There are no modifications, so this part of the DVD may be difficult for new exercisers, people very out of shape, or those with knee/back problems.

The breakdown in general is as follows:

3 Days a Week

  Mon and Fri - Abs and Circuit training (35 min)

  Wed - Circuit training and speed intervals (50 min)

4 Days a Week

  Mon and Fri - Abs and Circuit training (35 min)

  Wed - Circuit (no abs) (25 min)

  Thu - Speed intervals (aka 'cardio') (25 min)

5 Days a Week

  Mon, Wed, Fri - Abs and Circuit (35 min)

  Tue, Thu - Speed intervals (25 min)

6 Days a Week

  Mon, Wed, Fri - Abs and Circuit (35 min)

  Tue, Thu, Sat - Speed intervals (25 min)

For mix and match, you can combine the 3-minute warm-up with either 10- or 12-minute abs, plus 25 minutes of circuit training (w/modifications) and 25 minutes of hi/lo cardio intervals.

My 3 stars are maily due to the lack of labeling about equipment, an intermediate/advanced workout labeled as beginner (if it's ""Beginner,"" the workout should be tailored as such), a cardio workout that's the same for all fitness levels, and a suprising lack of variety. I'd recommend ""The Abs Diet Get Fit, Stay Fit Plan"" book over this DVD.",1158969600,71,2637,4.664488017429194
2596792,3,B000G0O5CI,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

The cardio moves were extremely unimaginative:  jog and jump, jog and jack, etc.  Then do everything again.  The weight segment also pretty much followed suit.  The basic and repetitive nature does not bother me.  It is more important that the moves actually get me in my target heart rate zone than be fun, fluffy, and new every two moves.

Unfortunately, this instructor just did not work for me.  I would have preferred silence to the repetitive and largely pointless commentary he gave throughout.  Instead of motivating, I just felt annoyed.  Granted, that is harsh, so if the instructor works for you, you will get a decent, basic workout.

The music only option is no better --- it is distracting rather than helpful.  They could have chosen any random jazzy music and played it over the moves and had the same match (pretty much nil.)  Music should at least have a definite beat that helps you keep pace with the moves.

Not a repeatable experience for me.  Comparatively, I enjoyed the abs diet for women workout much better.  While the moves were also very basic and repeated, it was effective without being non-annoying.",1301961600,,1187,4.830845771144278

This one is very challenging, even the beginner stuff was a tad too hard for me. I pulled a hamstring doing one of the exercises even though I stretched beforehand. The trainer, Terry Simpson, was not annoying at all. I like how you can customize your own workout.

After taking a bit of a hiatus for my knee to heal, I hit it hard again (minus the cardio part) and have been doing it three times a week for several months.

2596805,5,B000G0O5CI,"I have been using this DVD through Netflix and as a person who is lethargic, I am still in the basic set of exercises.  However, I have examined a number of workout videos and did not care for them, here's why:
* In most DVDs, either the camera work, or the instructor leave you guessing as to what you are supposed to be doing.  The instructor is excellent about explaining and cuing you to the next move.
* The instructors don't necessarily explain what benefit you get out of the exercises, but this instructor does.  Additionally, he will remind you of points to be concerned in the middle of an exercise so you can improve your workout and form.
* Most DVDs are too slow or too fast.  This one lets you hurt yourself at your own pace -- if you are not ready, you stick to basic.  If you need more of a workout, you do the intermediate which is shown in parallel with the basic.

One minor update: It is good enough that I ordered it, so as not to tie up my Netflix slot any longer!",1231286400,,986,4.190476190476191

2596808,3,B000G0O5CI,"Good workout, with an instructor who cues well. Countdowns for the timed segments. Some beginner modifications.

What I didn't like:

When you have a separate intro section, and this DVD does, introduce your fellow exercisers there, not in the workout segments. You get tired of hearing the intros each and every time. Same with the workout breakdown/technique explanations/equipment required, do it elsewhere, so that you're not just standing there wasting time.

Warning to those who don't like high-impact cardio, this DVD has some, and little in the way of modifications. Wouldn't be quite so bad if it were done on grass or a mat or carpet.  I wish people would remember that ""aerobic"" doesn't necessarily have to be rough on the joints.

On cardio day, I'd do the Speed Interval training on my rebounder so it would be easier on my knees and on strength training day, I'd do the Advanced Abs followed by the Muscle Toning routine. I use the warm up portion from this DVD and I just add a little more stretching on my own at the end. The Muscle Toning part where you'd have your arms above your head while doing squats for 90 seconds was VERY challenging. During the first round, I had 5 lb dumbbells on each hand and I almost didn't finish it so the second time around, I used 3 lb dumbbells and I was breathing hard after 90 seconds. I'd be sore the next day or 2 after doing this routine...Highly recommend this DVD. It's short but very effective in my opinion.",1207008000,5,862,4.167664670658683

You can even make up you own workouts. I'm a advance exerciser, and this workout challenged me! both the circuit, and speed interval (also know as HIIT) I've never found a HIIT workout on a dvd.(HIIT mean high intensity interval training). I found the ab portion really good the dvd had two seprate workouts for the abs, both beginner/intermediate and advance. The only negatives no variety, the same warm up is used for all the workouts, and the warm up is kinda boring, and it didn't have a cool down on the circuit weight part, and the cool down on the HIIT part was way too short for such an intense cardio workout.

It's the diet/lifestyle itself that's the most important to follow, and will shed the pounds and increase lean mass. As for this dvd, the workouts address all the muscle groups. I like the fact that you can mix and match the different phases of the dvd based on your workout schedule (i.e. warmup + ab workout + strength training). Not that it's a drastic flaw, but the only thing I didn't like was that the instructor uses the same weight dumbells for all exercises, but I just would swap dumbells in between the diff't exercises.

There's no wasted time here, no cute dances or weird, ineffective moves. Just straightforward weight training that I really feel the next day.

For the record, the interval training is only 25 minutes long, and is beginner-intermediate. It's fine, but a walk-run outdoors, or a gym bike on an interval setting, would work as well.

I'm not crazy about this workout DVD. The weight training exercises are pretty good, somewhat challenging - but I wasn't very challenged by the excercises targeting the Abdominals. The speed interval training was way too long for me. For someone who has never excercised, or anyone who used to excercise and is trying to get back into shape, the 50 minute speed interval training may prove to be discouraging. It keeps going on and on, I felt frustrated and annoyed the whole time. For someone who may be struggling with a workout schedule, this might not be the DVD for you.

It's not a total loss, I think I'll go back and keep doing the weight training part of the video, which is about a 30 minute routine. And maybe after a few weeks of getting myself into shape I'll try the 50 mintue speed interval training again. I wouldn't recommend the speed interval training for beginners, though.

I would like to recommend another fitness guru: Karen Voight(her DVDs are also here on amazon). I find her abdominal workouts much more challenging. Her routines are usually about 30 mins. I rarely find myself frustrated with the exercises she has you do. She warms you up really well (something I find other fitness videos often lack), she explains the positioning of each exercise very well, and always does a relaxing stretching session at the end. I find I can go along to one of her workouts and before I know it, it's over and I'm proud I've squeezed in a workout in my busy day. And I never feel burnout. I can talk myself in to doing another one 2-3 days later, no problem. That's the way it should be....

When you feel frustrated and annoyed, you don't feel like doing it again and again - and you may feel like giving up altogether. Don't let that happen, find another way to workout!",1184198400,,1933,4.454802259887006
2596829,5,B000G0O5CI,"The DVD starts off with a main menu consisting of
-Introduction
-Audio setup
-Weekly schedules
-Mix and match workouts
-Bonus: the abs diet eating plan.

In the introduction, the trainer, Terry Simpson, explains that the workout is based on the ABS 3 system and describes its principles. This is detailed in the book called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Abs-Diet-Get-Fit-Stay-Fit-Plan-The-Exercise-Program-to-Flatten-Your-Belly-Reshape-Your-Body-and-Give-You-Abs-for-Life/dp/1594864098/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Abs Diet Get Fit Stay Fit Plan: The Exercise Program to Flatten Your Belly, Reshape Your Body, and Give You Abs for Life!</a>.

The diet aspect of the Abs Diet is described in the section called `Bonus: The Abs Diet Eating Plan section'.

Under Weekly Schedules, there are 4 options.
If you can exercise:
-3 times a week
-4 times a week
-5 times a week
-6 times a week

I decided to try the '3 times a week' option.

Within the 3 times a week submenu, are 3 workouts:
Monday & Friday
Abdominal Workout & Big Muscle Circuit (35 mins)
-Beginner
-Advanced

Wednesday
-Big Muscle Circuit & Speed Interval Training (50 min.)

I decided to try the beginner abdominal and weight workout.  The trainer, Terry, was accompanied by 2 ladies Jenny and Shaela. They were super-fit. The first part was the warm up which consisted of various stretches and a short jog. Next up was the abdominal workout. For this you needed a mat and light dumbbells. For each exercise there was a beginner option (done by Jenny) and an intermediate option (done by Terry and Shaela). All the exercises came from the books:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Abs-Diet-The-Six-Week-Plan-to-Flatten-Your-Stomach-and-Keep-You-Lean-for-Life/dp/1594862168/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Abs Diet: The Six-Week Plan to Flatten Your Stomach and Keep You Lean for Life</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Abs-Diet-Get-Fit-Stay-Fit-Plan-The-Exercise-Program-to-Flatten-Your-Belly-Reshape-Your-Body-and-Give-You-Abs-for-Life/dp/1594864098/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Abs Diet Get Fit Stay Fit Plan: The Exercise Program to Flatten Your Belly, Reshape Your Body, and Give You Abs for Life!</a>. After the abdominal section was the big muscle circuit. Equipment needed was hand weights, mat and Swiss ball. The big muscle circuit was tough because of the number of reps of each exercise. The exercises were done for either 60 or 90 seconds. They were done in a slow and controlled manner. The descriptions and demonstrations by the instructor were very helpful. During this section of the DVD I was sweating profusely and my muscles ached. The effectiveness is definitely in the number of reps.

The only thing missing from this workout is a cool down. I had to stretch on my own at the end.

The big muscle circuit and speed interval training consisted of a warm up, weight exercises and cardio.  Materials needed for the muscle circuit - hand weights, Swiss ball and mat. For the cardio, jogging, jumping jacks, skipping, knee skips, squat hops and thrust reach-ups (the hardest) are done. Periods of low and high intensity are alternated. By the middle of the workout you will be panting and sweating.

I was pleasantly surprised by how the larger number of reps in the weight workout affected me, as well as the cardio intervals and so I am satisfied with this DVD however the packaging should have stated what materials would be needed to complete the workouts (mat, weights, and Swiss ball).  I'm looking forward to trying all the workouts on the DVD as well as mixing and matching.",1182902400,30,3713,5.879182156133829
2596830,4,B000G0O5CI,"I really like this dvd.  Although I gave the first one a good review, I quickly outgrew it and stopped using it.  This dvd, though, is a different story.  I've been trying to incorporate HIIT cardio into my workouts and have had a difficult time doing it since it's so difficult to do.  The HIIT cardio on this dvd is perfect to go along with.  It's 25 minutes of pure high intensity interval training.  And, it's HARD, but it's kind of fun, too.

Another good thing that stands out on this is the advanced abdominal portion.  It starts out easy, but the truth is, by the last set, I was a bit nauseous since it was that difficult. That has NEVER happened to me-- EVER.  I can do abs for a LONG LONG time and still have more energy.  This, for some reason, was a bit harder than I expected.  I'm impressed.

I am reviewing these sections only since I do other weight training workouts and didn't purchase this dvd for those portions.  I did do the beginner abs, though, and that was not difficult at all.

The guy leading the workouts is friendly and cues well.

The only complaint I have is the lack of countdown timer on the screen. There is a countdown for each set of exercises, but there isn't a total countdown. For instance, the cardio portion had a countdown for each interval, so I knew how much longer I had to keep going, but there was no countdown for the entire workout, and I had just taken off my watch.",1176249600,8,1418,4.2981132075471695

8128184,5,B000G0O5CI,"Excellent DVD! The excercises are very reasonable in length; easy to moderately advanced(depending on your preference). The DVD menu setup is very straight-forward, complete with several different workout options.",1322611200,,213,6.379310344827586
8128185,5,B000G0O5CI,"I have no experience exercising, I don't go to the gym and I am not planning on joining any in the near future. I only run twice a week, and although I am very slim, I had this pesky fat around my waist which was bothering me because I couldn't get rid of it. A friend of mine suggested working my abs, so I started browsing DVDs to get a little help, but before buying something, I decided to rent it and try it first.

I was worried the work outs on this DVD would be too challenging for me and would only motivate me to give up, well, I was proven wrong! They're very good and simple for beginners, and I even try the ""intermediate"" variations sometimes. I have yet to try the ""advanced"" variations.
The instructions are clear and the trainer does a demo of each exercise before starting the repetitions. It keeps me motivated and focused.
This is my second week with this program and I am already seeing results! They might be small changes in the way my clothes fit, but it's very promising.
Long story short, I decided to buy this dvd. Can't wait for it to arrive in the mail!",1311811200,,1082,4.252427184466019
8128186,3,B000G0O5CI,"The weights routine seemed fine, but I have preferred other trainers' ab workouts more, and found myself giving up on the aerobics part about three quarters of the way through due to the difficulty. I have been doing Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred for a few months, so I'm more intermediate than beginner by now, I think. The aerobics routine in the Abs Diet 2 workout is 25 minutes long, but you don't get any rest at all in between moves so you're alternating between light aerobics of about a minute (light jogging) and then intense aerobics (like jumping jacks) of about a minute, all without stopping for almost half an hour. Also, I didn't really take to the trainer. I found him a little annoying, but that's just personal preference.",1308182400,,741,4.66412213740458
