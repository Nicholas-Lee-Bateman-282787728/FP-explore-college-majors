8625032,5,B0042Y68BK,"I purchased this DVD from Amazon UK a while ago when I first discovered Suzanne Bowen (not sure why but Amazon US was not carrying it then and doesn't seem to be carrying it now either).  I have a few other 10 Minute Solution DVDs and I predominantly like them as add ons or for days when I really don't feel like working out but have convinced myself to do 10 minutes just to shake off the guilt ;) I intended to use this DVD for the same purpose. However, the first time I popped the DVD into my player and set myself up for one or two short workouts, I just couldn't stop! I ended up finishing all 5 workouts on the DVD and got an excellent workout! I do love Suzanne's BarreAmped DVDs and was aware of the way her workouts tend to be more barre based. With the short length of the workouts though, I expected this DVD to be more like Suzanne's other 10 Minute Solution DVDs, which are both more pilates based. It was therefore a pleasant surprise to see that the express workouts on this DVD are all true to Suzanne's barre side (low impact, toning-intensive, all about the BURN and SHAKE). I was sore all over the next day (in a great way!) and this has become one of my favourite pick-me-up DVDs for days when I just need some motivation to get moving. Suzanne is lovely as usual, very encouraging and on point with instructions. The segments fly by and even when I do barre workouts almost daily, I never fail to feel the burn with this one. Highly recommended!",1440979200,2,1468,4.280575539568345
