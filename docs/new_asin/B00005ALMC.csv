Marc Singer and Lisa Pescia are incredible. And yes, they do have chemistry. Pescia is incredible! Super sexy, smart, conniving, vindictive--my kind of lady! Ha! Ha! Singer meets her at his sexual research job and in only one weekend ends up planting the seeds to his own destruction. How do women do that to us! it just goes to show that no man can resist a sexy, beautiful and alluring woman.

Some people say this is a copy of Fatal Attraction but I say the two films are completely different and the endings certainly are. If you like intense sexual situations and a hot and naked woman who will do whatever she wants to get the man she desires, buy this film on DVD. I already have it and plan to view it again on DVD when it's next selected.

I'm the ninth person to rate this DVD and I rate it at Five Stars. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.

7935454,4,B00005ALMC,"This movie is a bit like fatal attraction, but I thought it was more intense. It doesn't end quite the same way either.  The cast was great and had great chemistry.",1366675200,,164,4.290322580645161
7935455,5,B00005ALMC,"Both versions (never advertised that way) are well produced, beautifully designed, wonderful scenery and superior acting by perfect casts.  My vote goes to ""Body Chemistry"" because of Marc Singer.  You see, I'd pay for tickets to watch that man sitting on stage, reading (out loud) a telephone book.

He is really a perfect specimen and isn't shy about showing off his magnificent physique.  If you'd like a few good views of Marc and his ""Singer,"" you'll love this film.  Have a drool cup handy.",1264377600,,496,4.857142857142857
7935456,5,B00005ALMC,"I loved this movie from beginning to end. Marc Singer made this movie so interesting in my opinion. I haven't seen a movie of this genre since ""Fatal Attraction"" (which was just as awesome).",1002585600,8,190,4.617647058823529
7935457,5,B00005ALMC,"This a great movie not only because Marc Singer is in it, but is very well done.  Don't be put off by similarities to Fatal Attraction...it is in some ways better.  Plus Marc shows his behind.",999648000,9,192,4.305555555555555
7935458,5,B00005ALMC,"First off everyone should watch this movie for one reason alone! Marc Singer! This guy was the Beastmaster...THE BEASTMASTER!! Not to mention staring in tons of great soft core Cinemax at night style movies. Don't stop with this movie. Watch Street Corner Justice, Cyberzone, Deep Space, etc. The list goes on and on. This movie right here is pure genius. Leonard Maltin refers to it as a Fatal Attraction clone but in reality this movie was filmed prior to Fatal Attraction. It just took longer to get released because it lacked the mega-starpower that Fatal Attraction had. Not to mention this is far superior. Marc Singer is ten times tougher than Michael Douglas.  And with lines like ""I didn't want anything serious, but you do.  You want to get beaten up."" it's clear that the scriptwriter was a absolute genious. I cannot say enough of how great this movie really is. Please do yourself a huge favor and pick this screen gem up immediately.",997142400,13,947,4.7682926829268295
