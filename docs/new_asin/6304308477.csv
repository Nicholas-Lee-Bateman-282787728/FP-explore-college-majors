844263,5,6304308477,"This is one of my favorite films - not just of the 1930s, but of all time. Rarely have I seen elements of both comedy and tragedy blended together so smoothly and seemingly effortlessly. The movie is nearly 70 years old now. Naturally, some parts of it are dated. Still, I suspect it was rather advanced in its views at the time. One character, Carlotta Vance [Marie Dressler], for example, is a faded beauty in her 60s who was once a great star. Instead of voicing regret that she has had many lovers and has always used men to advance herself financially, she exudes the confidence of one who has lived life to the fullest. And watch as she counsels the young Paula Jordon, who has taken and older lover and has decided to dump her dashing young fianc. No moral platitudes from Carlotta, just some sage advice. In fact, all of the female characters are strikingly independent, despite the fact that men are, by necessity,  their main source of income. I like these women!
MGM intentionally assembled the greatest cast it had on hand at the time. These were stars the public loved to see. This is from the days where there really were parts for older actresses. Ms. Dressler, who leads the cast in the credits, was sixty-five. The divine Billie Burke [Millicent Jordon], who I think was one of the funniest actresses who ever lived, was forty-eight. Jean Harlow, who plays the social climbing Kitty Packard, was just  twenty-two, and Madge Evans [Paula] was twenty-four. Unlike today, the two older stars were not forced into subordinate roles. All of the actresses' parts have equal weight.
We have both Lionel and John Barrymore. John gives a heart-wrenching performance as Larry Renault, the alcoholic, washed up matinee idol Paula has fallen for. The role is eerily similar to his own life. Wallace Beery is hysterical as the oafish self-made millionaire, Dan Packard.
The plot is fairly simple. Millicent is planning a dinner party for the much sought after Lord and Lady Ferncliff, but trials and tribulations await her at every turn. Meanwhile, Oliver is about to lose the family shipping business. Carlotta thinks she is broke. Kitty is having an affair with a society doctor. And so forth. But the movie is about more than just a storyline. It's about great actors playing great characters. Times have changed, and so has society. Emotions haven't, and this is one emotionally charged movie. It remains fascinating and, in many ways, relevant. Best of all, it is great entertainment.  And I almost forgot to mention the director was the inimitable George Cukor, one of the best who ever lived.",1020729600,32,2603,4.818791946308725
844264,4,6304308477,"Dinner at Eight offers a chance to see some of the greatest stars of the early Thirties all together in one film.  Lionel Barrymore stars as a failing businessman whose wife, Billie Burke, is putting on a dinner party for an English nobleman.  Their engaged daughter Madge Evans is in love with an alcoholic has-been actor John Barrymore, while Lionel's doctor Edmund Lowe is having an affair with Jean Harlow, the wife of Lionel's business opponent Wallace Beery.  Added into this mix is Marie Dressler as an aging former actress and friend of Lionel's who is in need of money.  It's quite a collection of characters coming together for one evening, especially when they are played by the actors in these roles.  Jean Harlow gives one of her best performances as the tough social climber, and her fight scenes with Beery are well played by both.  The Barrymore brothers have the serious roles in the film and play them with great skill, with special credit going to John who comes so close to playing himself it's almost uncomfortable to watch.  Burke is very funny as the hostess trying to impress everyone as her party falls apart.  However, it's Dressler who has some of the best lines, and she plays them with relish.  Her acting in the closing scene alone makes the video worthwhile.  Yes, it is very talky and episodic as it moves from one subplot to another, but it all comes together at the end very well.  I do wish music had been included on the soundtrack, but this was early in the era of sound. But it's a funny, honest, and sophisticated comedy, and movie fans will want to seize the opportunity to see so many great stars in peak form!",990748800,,1651,4.600682593856655
844265,5,6304308477,"This is one of the best films from Hollywood's heyday! Comedy and Drama perfectly blended together by a great director and a stellar cast. Knockout performances by Marie Dressler, Lee Tracy and Glinda herself, Billie Burke but its Jean Harlow who knocked me for a loop! As Kitty Packard, the wife of a tycoon she is sensational! She is all silver, platinum, satin,diamonds and deco with one hitch! When she opens her mouth no pearls roll out just razor blades! She steals the show.

844266,5,6304308477,"A must-see classic from the days when it was both fun and intellectually invigorating to go to the movies.  Marie Dressler is a stand out as washed-up actress Carlotta Vance (it's hard to believe that a woman who  looked like Dressler could become one of the top 10 box office names in  Hollywood, but she did it in the 30's - but that was before today's  shallow, looks-obsessed culture).  Her performance in this film makes me  wonder why MGM doesn't release more of her films onto home video / DVD (as  of now ""Emma"" and ""Tugboat Annie"" are still waiting for  release).  You'll also enjoy seeing Jean Harlow and Wallace Beery go at it  - Jean is at her huffing, puffing best (if you saw her in ""Libeled  Lady"", you'll know what I mean) as the sexier half of a nouveau rich  couple who behave like something out of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia  Woolf?"" throughout the film.  The scenes at the end when Dressler and  Harlow meet and exchange witticisms are worth the price of the video alone  (favorite part: Harlow announces ""I was reading a book  yesterday,"" and Dressler staggers back in shock).  Also featured in  the film are: Billie Burke (Glinda from ""The Wizard of Oz""), John  and Lionel Barrymore, Lee Tracy, and Louise Closser Hale (an actress you  don't see much of in films) as a witty friend of Burke's.  A treat from  start to finish - I'm guessing Hollywood will try to remake it soon and  will botch it royally (they already have on TV - make sure you stay away  from that version).",956620800,2,1496,4.492537313432836
844267,5,6304308477,"Highly successful as a stage play by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, DINNER AT EIGHT ran for 232 performances at the Music Box Theatre where it opened in October of 1932. Many feel the script used for this screen  adaptation is even better than the original. Millicent Jordan (Billie  Burke) is a flighty socialite who arranges a dinner party in the honor of  the never seen Lord and Lady Ferncliffe. Millicent's husband Oliver (Lionel  Barrymore in a surprisingly restrained portrayal) tries to hide from his  preoccupied wife the fact that his steamship line is on the verge of  financial disaster and futhermore, he's on the brink of a physical  breakdown. Lionel Barrymore is sympathetic as the dying Oliver,  underplaying the part effectively. Lee Tracy is excellent as Larry  Renault's agent; Edmund Lowe has just the right combination of virility and  polish for the role of  society Dr. Wayne Talbot. Billie Burke is vivacious  here as the fluttery matron who's unaware that her fine house is tumbling  down. Jean Harlow blooms under Cukor's direction and her playing of Kitty  Packard is riotous fun. John Barrymore IS Larry Renault and he's chillingly  realistic as the has-been ham actor who's glory days are long over. Madge  Evans does well in the role of Paula; her freshly  youthful beauty and  sincere playing are considerable assets to the film. The great Marie  Dressler got first billing in this all-star extravaganza, and although some  feel she wasn't quite right for the part of Carlotta Vance, she's  undeniably funny and brings a real ""human touch""  to the role  which could have been played  annoyingly one-dimensional by the majority of  other matronly screen actress of her day. That's Elizabeth Patterson (Mrs.  Trumbull in ""I Love Lucy"") as Oliver Jordan's secretary. One  feels that they've been to one hell of a party after seeing this  fascinating example of prime Hollywood talent, 1933 style!",945820800,3,1929,5.038095238095238
844268,5,6304308477,"DINNER AT EIGHT is great fun to watch due to the stellar cast of these uniquely talented stars of the early thirties. Marie Dressler is fun as the stage actress Carlotta Vance - she's both natural and hilariously affected in her broad playing of a grande dame who's seen better days financially. When Oliver Jordan's fifty - something secretary, (Elizabeth Patterson) tells Carlotta that she relished seeing Vance in her swan song performance - when she was a little girl - Carlotta retorts with a venomous glare ""HOW EXTRAORDINARY""! - ""We must talk of the CIVIL WAR someday, just you and I""! Lionel Barrymore succeeds in getting sympathy from the audience as Oliver Jordan, the dying shipping magnate: he's hiding the inevitable from his self-centered, social climbing wife. Jean Harlow plays Kitty Packard, a sexy, wisecracking floozie: her afternoon exercise is reading movie magazines and eating bon bons in bed. Wallace Beery plays the uncouth Dan Packard with whom Kitty has a sensational squabble about her origins and his flat-chested first wife. Billie Burke gives a downright sparkling performance as the foolish, fluttery and totally self-absorbed Millicent (this is, perhaps her best performance.) John Barrymore is always a fascination, yet his playing seems rather hammy and obvious in this, Madge Evans is a 1933 moderne and Lucy is played by the antiseptic Karen Morley. Lee Tracy is brilliant and chilling as Barrymore's agent who has to reveal to the once great star that he's THROUGH. Hilda Vaughn is Harlow's conniving maid; she slyly suggests that a diamond bracelet would suffice just fine in exchange for keeping mum about the doctor (Edmund Lowe) who makes Kitty ""feel better"" during the day! You will be enchanted by this Cukor classic which is a star-studded delight from 1933.",943833600,2,1803,5.115254237288136
844269,5,6304308477,"Dinner at Eight is one of the funniest, sharpest comedies in film history.  Based on the Moss Hart-Edna Ferber play, the film deals with a dinner party at which several members of New York society have been invited.  The  film features an immpeccable cast:  feuding castmates Jean Harlow and  Wallace Beery, at the height of their comedic powers; Marie Dressler,  perfectly cast and delivering the film's classic last line; John Barrymore,  pretty much playing himself, brilliantly; and Lionel Barrymore and Billie  Burke, impossibly married to each other.  Dinner at Eight is unusual in the  canon of director George Cukor, considering the film's rather scathing view  of the rich, but he's made a delightful film that speeds by with an energy  that's rarely been matched in comedy.",912470400,3,783,5.126984126984127

844485,4,6304308477,"This film from MGM and directed by George Cukor (My Fair Lady) assembles a whos who of Hollywood, both vets and up-and-comers.  I usually like films of this genre (comedy/drama) from this era for a variety of reasons.  One is the great sets, especially when they contain the art deco style.  Unfortunately this film is set in NYC, so the sets are statelier with lots of dark wood, thick carpets and gaudy ornaments.

Lionel Barrymore plays Larry Renault, a once wealthy shipping magnate.  What most people don't know, is that his business is struggling and hes close to being tapped out.  This is actually a common theme throughout the film.  Larrys wife, Millicent (Billie Burke, who everyone will recognize as Glinda in The Wizard of Oz) is organizing a grand dinner (at eight oclock) followed by a trip to the theater.  The guest of honor is some Lord from England or something.  The Renaults 19-year old daughter, who is engaged to be married, is having an affair with a 47 year old actor (John Barrymore), a drunk and Hollywood bust trying for a part on Broadway.

Wallace Beery plays Dan Packard, a Wall Street tycoon and Jean Harlow plays his wife Kitty.  Their real life 26 year age difference would suggest that the spread between the aforementioned teen and middle age actor is par for the course.  And then there is Dr. Wayne Talbot played by Edmund Lowe.  Hes having an affair with Kitty, but hey, hes 5 years younger than Beery.  The top actor during this era however was Marie Dressler who plays Carlotta Vance, another has-been actor who is also coming up short with living expenses.  Shes an old friend of Larrys who has stayed in touch throughout the years.  She and Billie Burke get most of the funny stuff.  The drama is handled by the Barrymores.

The film is mostly a lot of extended scenes featuring the individual actors which all leads up the eventful dinner party which, alas turns out to be uneventful.",1467158400,,1928,4.670623145400594

844488,2,6304308477,"My mother and I watched most of this movie, expecting it to be a comedy (from what the box said). Comedy? There was not a single laugh or even smile to be had. The movie ranged from boring to unpleasant, and there were plenty of big stars but nary a likable or sympathetic character in the lot.

The movie stars a wealthy New York woman who wants to throw a dinner party for the purpose of social advancement, with her husband reluctantly going along. She invites over a wealthy British couple who are coming to the United States, and invites a number of other people to have the proper number, as well as the right mixture of males and females. But everyone has some sort of dark secret; the couple's daughter, who has a fiance, has fallen in love with an actor whose career is failing; the husband's company is in serious financial trouble; a former actress is also in financial difficulty; a bullying former miner is secretly buying out the husband's company's stock, and his wife is having an affair; and this is just a sample of the betrayals and intrigues that are going on.

This could have had the makings of a comedy, but we found no jokes or any other reasons to laugh. Nor did we end up caring what happened to any of the characters in the story. Pass up this dinner invitation.",1464566400,,1289,4.434599156118144

Both Lionel and John Barrymore shine in their hardly intersecting universes as men facing in succession possible and inevitable ruin. In the face of all this star power plus that of Wallace Berry playing her blustering husband Jean Harlow more than holds her own as a woman with designs.

It is not really a comedy, and I don't see how it ever made it onto the list of 100 funniest movies. I did some digging to find out how my response could differ so much and was a little relieved to find that the original review (as a play) in the NYT actually agreed with me in some regards; the NYT reviewer said that the ending was very dissatisfying. Also, the original movie trailer did not bill it as a comedy. There are clever lines delivered very well in the movie but I could not overcome my distaste for the behavior of almost everyone on the screen (with the possible exception of Billy Burke, who has a sweet quality about her even when she's being an airhead).",1363219200,,899,4.383233532934132

BUT this one takes you in so many directions that you have to tip the hat to George for collaborating the many complex elements into a single dinner party... I was truly surprised at how poorly Jean Harlow looked and acted after hearing so many blonde bombshell comments, looked like a 9YO boy with an even less impressive voice...but the hair was the rage I guess.. Marie who they made up like Frankenstein for some odd reason was the funniest aspect of the film, she had the comedic chops in the midst of despair of the 30's collateral damage... if anyone makes a movie bout this era PLEASE look at the sets, costumes, hairstyles, etc. to get it right (i.e. Funny Lady, DUH!) the sets were incredible! recommend for Barrymore fans and my dear Marie!",1338163200,,814,4.659722222222222
844967,5,6304308477,"This is, quite frankly, the film that has Jean Harlow and Marie Dressler giving immortal performances and for that reason alone, is well worth the price.

Flighty Billie Burke wants to have a dinner party and throws together an improbable guest list.  There's Carlotta Vance, (Dressler) who just swept down from the moon she is so fabulous.  There is the scheming businessman (Wallace Beery) and his harpy, blonde, beautiful wife (Harlow) who is having an affair with her doctor (Edmund Lowe).  And there is John Barrymore, a fading actor wrecked by debt and alcohol, who is having an affair with the daughter of Billie Burke and Lionel Barrymore.

So there's a lot going on.  And it's funny.  And it's classic.  And, I think, better by one star than ""Grand Hotel"", made the previous year.  This is MGM star power, 30's style, flexing its box office muscle and it can still lift us today, 80 odd years later.

Lionel B. and Madame Dressler are both broke but won't admit to that (only to each other).  Like ""Grand Hotel"", everyone has a secret.  Poor Billie Burke flutters around going crazy over an aspic.  It's really Depression-era tragedy, all gussied up as comedy and hijinks, but if you listen closely, it isn't.

844970,3,6304308477,"Dinner at Eight was one of the earliest star studded blockbusters. It followed the tremendous success of ""Grand Hotel"" the year before, and has several carryovers - John and Lionel Barrymore, Jean Hersholt, and Wallace Beery as actors, and William Daniels as the cinematographer with William Axt providing the score. To this they added Jean Harlow, Marie Dressler, Lee Tracy, Edmund Lowe, and Billie Burke.

The film is based on the Broadway play of the same name by George S Kaufman and Edna Ferber. It was adapted to the screen by Herman Mankiewicz, Frances Marion, and Donald Stewart.

This was a powerhouse of talent -

* Wallace Beery had been nominated as Best Actor for his role in ""The Big House"" (1930) and won for ""The Champ"" (1932),
* The Barrymores were Broadway royalty and had just appeared together in ""Rasputin"" (1932) as well as ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), John had an enormous success with ""Svengali"" (1931) and Lionel had won the Best Actor for ""A Free Soul"" (1930).
* Marie Dressler won the Oscar in 1930 for ""Min and Bill"" (Beery was the co-star) and was nominated again in 1932 for ""Emma"".
* Jean Harlow was MGM's hottest rising star with enormous successes in ""Platinum Blonde"" (1931), ""The Beast of the City"" (1932), ""Scarface"" (1932), ""Red Dust"" (1932) and ""Red Headed Woman"" (1932).

Look for Jean Hersholt who makes a brief appearance as John Barrymore's producer. Also note that John and Lionel never play a scene together. This was not uncommon. The brothers often feuded and could go months without speaking to each other. Many of the screen appearances have them working independently.

Often spoken of as a comedy, (e.g., AFI ranks it #85 in its list of 100 top comedies) buyer beware - the comedy is about as sporadic as the gulps for air of a drowning man, and the plot of the film resembles people being sucked down the social and economic drain. This is a Depression era melodrama, not a comedy, even if it is interspersed with the occasional laugh. Here's a brief overview of some of the main characters -

* A third generation shipping magnet (Lionel Barrymore) whose health is failing and whose business is on the rocks.
* A greedy and less than honest businessman (Beery) who stays in an adulterous union to pursue his political career.
* A drunken, womanizing, suicidal, actor (John Barrymore) whose best days are past him and who is on the verge of bankruptcy.
* A self absorbed housewife (Billie Burke) who is more concerned with her dinner party than her husband's health and her daughter's scandalous affair.

Not exactly light faire.

George Cukor (1899-1983) directs. Cukor was nominated 5 times for an Oscar and won once (""My Fair Lady"") in 1964. He's best known for his comedies ( ""The Philadelphia Story"", ""Adams Rib"", ""Born Yesterday"", ""Pat and Mike"") but was equally capable with drama (""Romeo and Juliet"",  ""A Star is Born"", ""Gaslight""). He's famous for saying  ""Don't just do something, stand there!"" All things considered, this is one of Cukor's poorer efforts. Basically he has decided to treat the film as a play, and shoots it accordingly.

This was David Selznick's (1902-1965) first film for MGM after leaving RKO (where he worked with Cukor). Selznick would go on to produce such Oscar nominated classics as ""Viva Villa"" (1934), ""David Copperfield"" (1935), ""Anna Karenina"" (1935), ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1935), ""A Star is Born"", and, of course, ""GWTW"" (1939). For a Selznick film the production values are exceedingly poor, even down to the trappings of the rich and famous.

Williams Daniels (1901-70) is the cinematographer. Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim and also Greta  Garbo who used him in all but 2 of her films. Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times (""Anna Christie"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""How the West was Won"") and won once (""Naked City"" in 1948). Daniels camerawork follows Cukor's lead - you are watching a play.

""Dinner at Eight"" is one of those interesting 1930s films that shows its heritage from the silent era. Dressler and John Barrymore provide excellent examples of silent screen acting, and while it works well on the sound stage since they were both great actors at their core, silent or sound, it is essentially silent screen acting. The camera work is also very much like the standard silent film - a static camera that rarely moves, focused on medium shots for 30 seconds of more, with the occasional two shot. Actors exit and enter while the static camera remains motionless, as if we were watching a play. What is remarkable about this film is that a year earlier, in ""Grand Hotel"", the camera work is modern and fluid and yet it's also an MGM film and also photographed by Daniels.

What is strange is that while the camera work is vintage 20s, there is virtually no background music. William Axt (1888-1959) was primarily a silent film composer, working on films like ""The Mark of Zorro"" (1922), ""Greed"" (1924), ""Ben Hur"" (1925),and ""While the City Sleeps"" (1928). He continued working through 1940 when he retired.

""Dinner at Eight"" was #2 at the box office. The New York Times and Film Daily said it was one of the 10 best films of the year.

1933 was a good year for films. Box office hits were Mae West's  ""I'm no Angel"" and ""She Done Him Wrong"", Roby Keeler and Dick Powell in ""42nd Street"",  ""King Kong"", and Garbo in ""Queen Christina"". The Oscar winners were ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (Actor), ""Morning Glory"" (Actress) and ""Cavalcade"" (Picture). Other notable films released that year included the Marx Brothers' ""Duck Soup"", Laurel and Hardy's classic ""Sons of the Desert"", and ""The Invisible Man"". Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made their film duo debut in ""Flying Down to Rio"". FWIW - 1933 was the year that Walt Disney referred to the gold statue as an ""Oscar"" when he won it for ""The Three Little Pigs"".

Despite the poor camerawork, the depressing script, and the lack of any background music, the film contains marvelous performances. Marie Dressler is a hoot, and Jean Harlow, in addition to being Harlow, gets a chance to shape her comedic skills which would emerge more strongly as time went on. John Barrymore gives a tremendous performance, especially in his final scene by the fireplace, and Billie Burke is hilarious as the oblivious housewife whose world is crumbling around her while her biggest worry is that she will have to serve crabmeat instead of aspic as her appetizer.",1301443200,7,6436,4.8019891500904155
844971,2,6304308477,"I enjoyed some of the performances, particularly by Billie Burke and the Barrymores.  The acting was superb in this movie -- I have no complaint about the acting ability of anyone in the cast, including the bit parts.  May Robson as the cook, although she had only a small part, was very good, as were all of the leads.

Some reviewers here indicate the story is tiring and I cannot but agree.  Practically every leading man in this film is either a philandering husband (who could not be faithful if he tried) or a tyrant and sometimes both.  While the acting was good, this part of the storyline got really old, almost to the point of being too stereotypical.  The burnt-out actor and actress roles were portrayed as such caricatures that it was hard for me as a viewer to relate to them.

This movie reminds me of typical biography movies of the 90s and 2000s decades, where famous people are portrayed as having awful, sordid lives, despite their apparent fame and success. These kind of ""biographical"" movies where the famous person has an awful life all basically have the same plot and that is what makes them tedious.  As a viewer, we are somehow supposed to relate to every man being an unfaithful husband and every wife as adoring her creepy husband.  Although Jean Harlow does portray a disgruntled wife, her character is so out of place in this kind of ""rich and famous"" movie, the storyline trashes her as simply a low-class former chorus girl.  After portrayals of too many negative roles, a viewer longs for some kind of respite from the downtrodden, negative story.  Someone mentioned this movie is supposed to have some comedy in it, but I did not find anything comedic about this film.  The attempted humor in some of the lines fell flat.

I cannot really get too excited about this film because the storyline was too negative in its outlook.  The fine performances did not make up for the plodding storyline.  I feel the storyline needed something more in order to give it a smidgen of entertainment value.  Without this, it was just a travelogue about the downtrodden rich and famous and why we should not care about them.  I could never sit through this movie a second time.  It is not a classic by any means.

For film buffs who enjoy ""rich and famous"" soap opera-type movies, I would recommend ""The Razor's Edge"" with Gene Tierney, Tyrone Power, Anne Baxter, Clifton Webb and Herbert Marshall.  That movie is much more interesting than ""Dinner at Eight"" is.",1297296000,5,2480,4.670506912442396

The plot centers around the backstories of these guests at a dinner party.  Several of whom are having affairs with each other and are trying to do some sneaky business deals behind people's backs.  For the most part, I found the plot agonizing.  I just didn't care for that type of melodrama.  However, from an actor's point of view, the performers are flawless.  Athough, even among the best of the best, I found a shining star in Marie Dressler.  She is flat out superior as an actress with that added spark that puts her over the top of the rest.  And her character of the aging actress was actually one of the more likeable ones in the show.  So, I would use this movie for an acting class.

And yet there ARE signposts: for all the laughs, Cukor doesn't let us off scot-free. Bankruptcy, blackmail, suicide --Cukor helps us through the darker times and makes us giggle here and there, but the final shot of the dining room doors closing for dinner is both natural and very forboding: we're afraid for these people, even the chiseler (Berry? or Beery? sorry) and the gold digger (Harlow, who was never better). But don't get the wrong idea -- DON""T get turned off!! There are plenty of laughs here for those who go for the verbal/sophisticate brand of humor (tho. there are a few hints of slapstic, equally funny).

845049,5,6304308477,"Dinner At Eight is an outstanding movie with great acting, a fine plot even if a bit complicated, and a wonderful cast! The movie held my attention every step of the way; and it's a much more artistic film with much more social commentary than I expected.

When the action begins, Millicent Jordan (Billie Burke) is obsessively planning a dinner party. Unbeknownst to Millicent, her husband Oliver Jordan (Lionel Barrymore) is suffering from serious, life threatening heart problems--and their steamship freighter enterprise is going broke after a century-long life of being the family business.

As if that weren't enough, there's plenty more people with serious financial and personal problems that showcase human foibles as well the toll the depression took on even the wealthiest of people after the stock market crash. We meet Carlotta Vance (Marie Dressler), an older actress who is broke. Carlotta sells her stock in the Jordan shipping business to stay alive; and she's not the only one selling her stock on that fateful day when so much of the Jordan stock is sold that the family fortune just might be in jeopardy. There is Wayne Talbot (Edmund Lowe) and his wife Lucy (Karen Morley) who tolerates Wayne's never-ending marital infidelities; and we also see that the only people climbing up the ladder are the comparatively crude and unsophisticated couple Dan and Kitty Packard (Wallace Beery and Jean Harlow).

Throughout the movie there are vignettes that display how cruel life can be. There is a rather long scene in which we see the poignant suffering of a man who was huge in silent pictures and who has gone broke and ""washed up"" now that the ""talkies"" are in style. John Barrymore brilliantly plays Larry Renault and his story is told with great care and sophistication. I admire the way George Cukor directed Larry Renault's part of the story.

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here--how will Larry Renault handle the fact that he's through in show business? What happens when Lucy Talbot catches her husband Wayne cheating on her yet again--this time with Kitty Packard? How do the Packards even manage to stay together--they fight all the time. Moreover, when and how will Millicent Jordan ever come back down to Earth and realize that there are many things in life that are infinitely more important than her dinner party? No plot spoilers, here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

The DVD's best extra is a Sharon Stone hosted featurette on Jean Harlow which is very well done. The Vitaphone short ""Come To Dinner"" is amusing as well.

Dinner At Eight is a film that has so many wonderful actors and so much depth and meaning that it simply must be seen to be truly appreciated. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors and classic movie buffs will cherish this DVD for years to come.",1211587200,35,2848,4.849794238683128

845051,4,6304308477,"This movie was adapted from the work of George Kaufman and Edna Ferber by Frances Marion and Herman Mankiewicz, casting some of the best names in Hollywood. Brilliantly directed by George Cukor, the story is a character study of four individuals during depression era (1933), affected by love, greed, possible poverty, and infidelity. John Barrymore offers one of his finest performances as a down and out actor, Larry Renault, caught up with drinking, and in desperation commits suicide as he has no other way to go in a world that doesn't accept losers. Lionel Barrymore offers another great performance as Oliver Jordan, a shipping magnate and the CEO of a company, which is in financial ruins, and it is close to collapse unless a financier helps to save the company. Burdened with his heart problems, and his scatterbrained high-society wife, Millicent Jordan (Billie Burke) preoccupied with hosting a dinner party for rich and famous, and his only daughter in love with much older Larry Renault, is confronted with the realities of the Great Depression. Dan Packard (Wallace Beery) plays a devious and crooked financier who plots to gain from Oliver Jordan's company, and his unfaithful wife, Kitty Packard (Jean Harlow) who threatens him to do a good deed by spilling beans about his dirty scheme to Oliver Jordan, when Dan likes to file for divorce because of her infidelity. Marie Dressler as an aging star, Carlotta Vance is very entertaining; in spite of her own insecurities, she offers her wisdom to Paula Jordan (Madge Evans), when she gives her the news that her lover, Larry Renault committed suicide, and to Kitty Packard in the film's final scene.

If you are a fan of Jean Harlow, don't expect much from this movie as she is in a supporting role. Nevertheless she has offered a great performance in the company some of the Hollywood's greatest stars. With regards to the fans of John Barrymore, it is ironic that his final years in real life was somewhat similar to the character of Larry Renault as his addiction to alcohol and possibly Alzheimer's disease had significant impact on his movie career.",1188950400,2,2120,4.938375350140056

845053,5,6304308477,"""Dinner at Eight"" is a 1933 film that still holds up when viewed by today's audiences. How odd that it wasn't even nominated for an Academy  Award. This could be because it is quite similar in form to ""Grand Hotel"", which won the Best Picture Oscar the year before. It really is more of a comedy/melodrama than pure comedy, since there is much tragedy unfolding during the movie. Aging star Carlotta Vance (Marie Dressler) is broke, silent film star Larry Renault (John Barrymore) is ""washed up"" and a hopeless alcoholic, and Oliver Jordan (Lionel Barrymore) is in danger of losing his shipping business. While these people are all struggling, the only characters that are doing well are the reptilian Dan and Kitty Packard (Wallace Beery and Jean Harlow). Dan Packard is a self-made millionaire with no ethics, and his wife is a gold digger with eyes for another man - her personal physician. The lives of the players all intertwine in ways that are unknown to them, with the depression-era message being that the rules of life have changed in ways that had never occurred in the U.S. before. The vice of the opportunistic social-climbing Packards is rewarded, while the well-heeled of yesteryear, playing by the rules of the past, have nothing but their memories and faded finery left to comfort them.

Of course, there are plenty of comic moments. Billie Burke's performance as Mrs. Jordon is hilarious as her prime concern is that her carefully planned dinner party is coming apart before her very eyes. She comes across as a kinder, gentler Marie Antoinette when she acts like the accidental destruction of her centerpiece dish, a lion-shaped aspic, is the end of the world. Although many have said that Jean Harlow steals this picture, and her talents do shine through, I think Marie Dressler's comic touches really help make the film. For example, when a forty-something secretary mentions that she saw Dressler's character perform ""when she was a little girl.""  Dressler replies that the two must get together some evening and discuss the Civil War. Dressler also makes the very last scene of the movie. As everyone is going into dinner, she finds herself in conversation with Harlow's character. First off, she does a hilarious double-take when Harlow mentions she's been reading a book. Next,Harlow tells Marie Dressler how this book she has been reading says that machinery will soon take over every profession. Marie Dressler looks Jean Harlow up and down as only she could do and says ""My dear I don't think you need to worry about that.""",1176681600,3,2551,4.91415313225058
845163,5,6304308477,"I am a huge Jean Harlow fan. I keep waiting for a Jean Harlow DVD boxed set to be released but alas none yet. So I am buying her movies one at a time. Dinner at Eight is one of the first screwball comedies of the 1930's. Also one of the first ""all star"" movies. It features such greats as John and Lionel Barrymore and the wonderful Wallace Beery. Jean Harlow did not make many movies, she tragicly passed away at age 26. But she left behind some great movies and Dinner at Eight is one of her best.",1174435200,5,499,4.05050505050505
845164,5,6304308477,"I'm glad to see virtual unanimity of approval of this classic film, so I won't rehash how great the cast is, or the story, or the great double-take near the end.  The comments I have to add are few:

Notice who the first billed performer is?  It's Marie Dressler, 65 years old and the highest paid actress in the 1930s.  We shall be charitable and say it wasn't because of her looks -- though she'd agree -- and I wonder if any movie made in Hollywood today or in the future would dare give lead billing to a woman over 30.

This movie reminds me of many other classic movies, beginning with John Barrymore's excellent self-destructing alcoholic (cf. Ray Milland, ""Lost Weekend""); Jean Harlow's constant sniping at Wallace Beery (cf. Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford in ""Born Yesterday""); and Dressler's wilting Carlotta Vance (see also Gloria Swanson in ""Sunset Boulevard"").

What hasn't been discussed a lot (but has been mentioned) is the DVD, and it's worthy of the movie.  Besides the good to very good transfer, there's an original trailer.  Better yet is the inclusion of Warner Bros. spoof ""Come to Dinner"", a short comedy featuring impersonators of all the cast members of ""Dinner at Eight"".  It's amazing how sharp satire could be in 1933, one year before the Hays Code started to be enforced.  And last, but not least, is a documentary about Jean Harlow, hosted by protege blonde siren Sharon Stone, and providing an interesting insight into an actress who was taken from us far too early.",1171843200,3,1504,4.772200772200772
845165,5,6304308477,"My mother used to use the expression ""dinner at eight"" to refer to the high-drama that always precedes the launching of a party.  She must have seen this 1933 film and it obviously influenced her for her entire life.  It wasn't until last night, however, that I, myself, saw this film on DVD.  And I must say that I can now well understand the effect it had on my mother and on her generation.

I've heard tales, read books and seen films about the Great Depression on America and what life was like in 1933.  But this film is neither a documentary about those times, nor a writer's analysis.  ""Dinner at Eight"" is the real thing.  It put me right there in the time and the place and, even though times have changed, the human drama is timeless.  Originally, it was a play written by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber and really does seem like a film version of a play, even though it was adapted for the screen. All of the scenes are set indoors and people make their entrances and exits through doorways rather than just letting the scene fade out.  Produced by David O. Selznick and directed by George Cukor, the cast is a star studded one, the acting is impeccable, and the impact is still there, even after all these years.

The cast reads like a who's who of Hollywood stardom.  Billy Burke and Lionel Barrymore are a wealthy couple planning a dinner party.  But their fortune is fading and Wallace Beery and his low-class trophy wife Jean Harlow represent the opportunistic newly rich upstarts.  The wealthy family's daughter is in love with a has-been actor played by John Barrymore.  And Marie Dressler is magnificent as a aging once-beautiful famous actress.  They are all getting ready for the dinner, and their intersecting stories are soon to be combined.  How it all plays out is as fresh today as it was in 1933.

Yes, there are differences.  There was no plastic surgery in those days.  With the exception of Jean Harlow, the actors look like regular people, not movie stars, and the older ones have lines in their faces and sagging chins.  The doctor smokes cigarettes.  Everyone drinks.  And the telephone is the most modern technological item.  The culture was changing too.  We can see that in the way the wealthy Americans are courting English aristocracy even though the depression is invading all of their lives.  There is love, death, grief and despair.  But there are also some hilariously funny moments.  The pace is fast.  There is not a dull moment.  And then, after all the personalities are developed, the plot is defined and some complex issues reconciled, everyone forces a smile and the dinner is served.

I loved the film.  And I was also delighted by the special 47-minute feature made in 1993 about Jean Harlow's life.  Narrated by Sharon Stone, the tragic story is fascinating and tragic.  I learned a lot as I never knew any of the details of Jean Harlow's life.  There is also a short spoof of the film and a very good trailer.  All and all, I must say that watching this DVD was a wonderful experience.  It was nice spending an evening in 1933. And it was even nicer to know that this is available to everyone on DVD. I highly recommend it.",1155686400,9,3180,4.576241134751773
845166,4,6304308477,"This film is a lovely slice of life look at the world of the upper crust--some of whose fortunes are dwindling, others who are on the ascension--during the Depression.  As all the other reviewers here have mentioned, the performances are stellar, the writing excellent, the storyline alternately funny, sad, wise and disturbing.

My favorite part of watching old movies like this is seeing old-time actors I'm only familiar with by name or by one other film.  For instance, I'd only seen Billie Burke as Glinda in the Wizard of Oz--a role she fit to a tee--and it was fun to see her play the society matron, and to do it so well. You can still hear echoes of Glinda in her voice, but her character in this movie is very, very different. Ditto for Lionel Barrymore, who I'm most familiar with from his role as the nasty Mr. Potter in ""It's a Wonderful Life!"" another classic film and immortal role.  Again, his character here is so un-Potter-like, it's an unexpected pleasure to see.

Anyway, no need to summarize the plot. You can find that spelled out elsewhere on this page. Basically, it reminded me of ""the Grand Hotel"" where we see a day in the life of a group of people, each with their individual triumphs and troubles, coming together for a brief period. Thoughtful, thoroughly entertaining, movie.",1155427200,3,1306,4.7105263157894735
845167,4,6304308477,"MGM's 1932 GRAND HOTEL, which featured an all-star cast in a series of interweaving plotlines set against a glamorous Berlin hotel, was a tremendous success, and the studio wasted no time in acquiring DINNER AT EIGHT, a popular Broadway show by George S. Kauffman and Edna Ferber that had much the same concept and which could be given the same all-star treatment.  When New York society matron and relentless social climber Millicent Jordan has the opportunity to host a dinner for members of the English aristocracy, she determines to go all out--and the film follows the lives of her soon-to-be guests over the course of a week.

Millicent (Billie Burke) is unaware that husband Oliver (Lionel Barrymore) faces both a business and medical crisis.  Oliver's friend Carlotta (Marie Dressler), a stage star of yesteryear, has sold her stock in Oliver's company--which allows loudmouth business tycoon Dan Packard (Wallace Beery) the chance to cash in at Oliver's expense.  By coincidence, Packard's wife Kitty (Jean Harlow) is having an affair with Oliver's doctor, Wayne Talbot (Edmund Lowe)--and if this were not complication enough, Oliver and Millicent's daughter Paula (Madge Evans) is on the verge of provoking a social scandal via an affair with aging and alcoholic movie star Larry Renault (John Barrymore.)  And all of them are invited to dine.

DINNER AT EIGHT is usually described as a comedy, and it is true that there are several notable comic performances.  The most famous of these are Wallace Beery and Jean Harlow, who give outrageous performances as the bickering Packards; Billie Burke and Marie Dressler also score as the harried hostess and the retired actress whose charms are long gone.  Where comedy is concerned, DINNER AT EIGHT plays extremely, extremely well and can hold its own with even the best of 1930s comedy--but in truth the movie is more of a drama than a comedy, and where drama is concerned it shows its age in no uncertain terms.

For one thing, the script relies a great deal on coincidence.  This adds to the fun where comedy is concerned, but it works less well for drama, and in DINNER AT EIGHT the neatness with which the parallel plots link to each other is a bit too pat.  For antoher thing, there is a clash of style between the film's comic and dramatic moments, most particularly in terms of the John Barrymore sequences, where the acting seems excessively stagey.  Instead of seamless, the various elements tend butt against each other in a slightly awkward way.

Even so, and whether your taste runs to acid-tongued comedy, broad melodrama, or wild farce, DINNER AT EIGHT offers a great deal to enjoy.  The performances are first rate, with the comic moments a true delight; there is dark irony in John Barrymore's performance; and the set designs and costuming are nothing short of iconographic: it is impossible to think of Jean Harlow, for instance, without envisioning her against a white-on-white Modern bedroom--and that, and a great deal more, comes straight out of this film.  Although the film has not been remastered, the print and sound are extremely good, and bonus features include a very good documentary on Jean Harlow, who more or less steals the show from her numerous co-stars.  Recommended.

Wallace Beery too -- he can play anything, even a man in a dress suit and tie. When the devil will someone release ""Tugboat Annie"" with Dressler and Beery on DVD?  Harlow convinces.  And the Barrymores -- what can I say?  There is so much meat to this that one viewing just won't do it.  Billie Burke plays Billie Burke and for a social comedy-drama that is a bit over the edge.

845169,5,6304308477,"The black cloud of the Great Depression shadows every scene and every character in DINNER AT EIGHT, George Cukor's brilliant adaptation of the hit Broadway play (it didn't hurt that the play was written by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, or screenwrit by Frances Marion and Herman Mankiewicz.  This is a smart and slick production.) I write that with a trace of wonderment.  I remember the comedy - I saw this movie years ago - but the serious undertones, the prominent minor chords, I didn't remember, and they caught me by surprise.

 The comedy is indeed memorable.  Jean Harlow, up until then more or less a platinum sexpot in a tight skirt who gave little indication she could act her way out of a paper bag practically steals the movie as the bored and socially ambitious wife of boorish businessman Wallace Beery.  As good as Harlow is, Beery matches against her well - have a bickering couple ever been this much fun? - and Marie Dressler, as the rather aged and worse for wear stage actress, is just as good in her scenes.  Dressler was cast against type in the sort of role Ava Gardner took after she'd worked her way through an ocean of booze and an arena full of matadors.  In Dressler's character's youth her beauty was so overwhelming that foolish young men - the Lionel Barrymore character was such a one - routinely rashly proposed marriage to her.  Dressler had a long stage and film career but was no Sarah Bernhardt or Theda Bara, and audiences in 1932 would have known that.  What she had was exquisite comic timing and a baedeker of facial expressions.

 Cast uncomfortably TO type is John Barrymore as the alcoholic, washed-up actor Larry Renault.  Renault receives an invitation for dinner (at eight), and therefore we're allowed to observe him behind closed doors.  What we see may make fans of Barrymore squirm a bit.  A cad and a drunkard, Renault is also a ham whose looks are going - one character remember him as having a `great profile,' if for no other reason than to drive the verisimilitude nail in a little deeper. In short, he's a ham who finds job offers drying up at an alarming rate.  The scenes with the Renault character aren't the most pleasant in the movie, but if you're a fan of John Barrymore you'll find them fascinating, and maybe even a little courageous.

 The extras on this disk include a trailer, a Sharon Stone hosted profile on Jean Harlow that satisfied my curiosity about the actress, and the Vitaphone short parody ""Come to Dinner.""  I thought the short was kind of flat.  DINNER AT EIGHT is so witty and comedy-filled already that ""Come to Dinner"" suffers in comparison.  It's interesting, and that's about it, although it doesn't detract from my strong recommendation for this disk.",1130976000,9,2744,4.686847599164927

845172,5,6304308477,"In the 21st Century, ""Dinner at Eight"" still entertains as a model of ensemble acting. Released in 1933 as an all star blockbuster, the film is set indelibly in the Depression. The plot revolves around the complex and intertwined lives of a group of mainly selfish and promiscuous people invited to the home of Lionel Barrymore, a bankrupt shipping magnate, and his frivolous wife, Billie Burke, for ""Dinner at Eight"".

Director George Cukor faultlessly mixes tragedy and humour into an irresistable cocktail. If the drama is a bit corny in spots (mainly the lines of Madge Evans), the humour is not and every scene with Jean Harlow or Marie Dressler is timeless. Dressler mugs, pouts and manipulates her rubber face creating an hilarious portrayal of an over the hill star. Savor her dialogue and mannerisms for this is overacting/scene stealing at its most accomplished; note in particular, her hilarious encounter with Elisabeth Patterson which is as memorable as the ending with Jean Harlow. All of Harlow's scenes with Wallace Beery are great too. Their shrill antagonism as they hurl the insults at each other is hysterical. John Barrymore adds an almost autobiographical portrait as the finished matinee idol and he is superb. Lionel Barrymore is very sympathetic, avoiding the overacting which often spoilt his performances. Billie Burke also has a very good part as the selfish and harried wife and she too is marvellous. Her scene when she finally explodes with exasperation is a stand out. Also, note Karen Morley's moving scene as the doctor's wife. She underacts to perfection.

The DVD print has not been restored but is good enough i.e. grainy in parts and with at least one visible tear. For once, an MGM DVD contains some worthwhile extras: there is a very funny short which takes the film off cleverly and a moving documentary about Jean Harlow narrated by a mannered and posturing Sharon Stone. The DVD is OK value but better if purchased as part of the Comedy Classics set.",1126396800,3,1993,4.9640718562874255
845279,5,6304308477,"I am grateful that Dinner At Eight is finally on DVD. This is a truly classic film which is as fresh as it was when it was released in 1934. I am an ardent Jean Harlow fan and she was a very gifted comedienne and no mere sex symbol. George Cukor said to her on the set, ""When I first saw you, I thought you were hopeless."" But Cukor said later that ""she played comedy as easy as a chicken lays an egg!"" Jean Harlow may look glamourous but she puts everything into the role of Kitty Packard that was written into it. She plays dumb to her husband's corrupt plans but proves to be more intelligent than one would ever guess. This a highlight in her brief life and career. She received rave reviews when the film was originally released and many critics stated that she stole the film from the stellar cast. Her fights with Wallace Beery are priceless and her one scene with Marie Dressler (who adored Jean and admired her talent enormously) is a perfect ending to a great film. I am puzzled that this film was not nominated for Best Picture! Marie Dressler is a delight in this film as she is in every sound film I have seen her in. Her comedic timing is perfection and she steals every scene she is in. Besides Jean Harlow, Wallace Beery, Marie Dressler we also have the magnificent Billie Burke, John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Madge Evans, Lee Tracy, Louise Closser Hale, Philip Holmes, Hilda Vaughn who is great as Harlow's maid Tina!. Cukor's direction is superb cutting from one story to another just when the viewer is wondering what is going on with a certain character. The sets are gorgeous and the script is great. I hope that Turner will soon release more Jean Harlow films. Make certain to see her in ""Platinum Blonde"" and ""Libeled Lady"". She died so young. At age 26 on June 7th, 1937. Like the great Carole Lombard, she left a legacy of timeless screen performances which are as fresh today as they were when they were filmed. ""Dinner At Eight"" is a milestone in her brief but brilliant career.",1125100800,3,2009,4.461956521739131
845280,5,6304308477,"DINNER AT EIGHT is often referred to as a comedy, and while there are some marvelous comic moments, this film is no more a comedy than THE GODFATHER.  I think one reason it is thought to be a comedy is the final lines of the film, where the decidedly unbookish Jean Harlow tells Marie Dressler that she had been reading in a book (a revelation that visibly jolts Dressler) that in the future all jobs would be done by machines.  After eye-balling Harlow from toe to head she assures her, ""Oh, my dear. That's something you need never worry about.""  There are other humorous moments, but the truth is that while the tone of the film might often be humorous, the form of the film is tragic.  Yes, the destruction of the Jordan shipping company has been prevented by Jean Harlow's character blackmailing her husband, who has been trying to buy a majority of the company shares via a proxy, but it doesn't change the sense of precariousness that pervades the film.  In many ways, this is one of the great films dealing with the end of the twenties and the effects of the stock market crash.  Although the film revolves around a hostess's efforts to throw a lavish dinner party, virtually every individual invited is suffering from problems of one sort or another.  The aging actress, long retired, is strapped for cash.  The actor, a former matinee idol, has been revealed as a former pretty face by the advent of the talking film; he now is unable to find work and utterly broke.  The shipping magnate, whose wife is organizing the dinner party, is suffering both from financial woes and ill health, and is in danger of losing the company that has bourn the family name for nearly a century.  The only individuals, in fact, who are thriving and doing well are the crude, ill-bred Packards, who are gaining in wealth as rapidly as all of those in the upper crust of society are losing theirs.  Few films in Hollywood history have been as fixated on class as this.  Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufmann, the authors of the original stage play, were always attuned to such issues in their work, and there is almost an anthropological air as they analyze the changes taking place in the upper rings of society.

The film features one of the most celebrated ensemble casts ever seen.  Brothers John and Lionel Barrymore have no scenes together, but apart they provide many great moments.  This was one of the last films that Lionel made while he was still able to ambulate normally.  Throughout the thirties arthritis and a serious hip injury made it increasingly difficult for him to walk, sometimes feigning onscreen injuries (such as a supposed broken leg in YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, that gave him an excuse to wield a crutch), always sitting as much as possible.  His brother John suffered even more decline, in his case brought on by the same kind of excessive drinking we see in his character.  There is, however, a great deal of difference between Barrymore and Larry Renault, the actor he portrays.  Renault is a has-been, a former pretty face with no real acting talent.  Barrymore possessed prodigious talent, and despite his increasing drinking difficulties managed to find a great deal of work throughout his decline, even if what he mainly played was a series of drunks.  The film creates an odd time warp for me, since in 1933 both John and Lionel were aging, yet 72 years later John's granddaughter and Lionel's great niece Drew is still quite young.

One of the joys of the film is being able to see the great Marie Dressler as aging former stage actress Carlotta Vance.  Despite being extremely overweight and possessing looks that could only be described as extremely unpleasant, one noticed her appearance only briefly after seeing her in action.  One of the great stage performers of her day, for some reason Dressler never managed much success in film during the silent era.  Ironically, after age had ravaged her looks and her obesity increase, she unexpectedly became one of the first great stars of the sound film, winning an Oscar for one film and a nomination for another, and completely upstaging Greta Garbo in her first sound film.  DINNER AT EIGHT is not Dressler's greatest performance, but for most film fans it is the most readily obtainable one.  Tragically, shortly after the film was released she was diagnosed with cancer, and she died less than a year after the film's release.  It is a fitting tribute to her that the best and final moment of this film was created by her stunned reaction to Harlow's stating that she had been reading a book.

The vivacious Billie Burke had been recently widowed when she starred in the film as Mrs. Jordan, her husband no less than the greatest of Broadway impresarios, Florence Ziegfield.  She sparkles in every scene in which she appears.  Wallace Beery always came across as a bit of a bull in a china shop, and here the china shop is anything to do with social grace.  There is also a hint in his character of the way the country as a whole was changing, as the men who know their way around money started supplanting the traditional aristocracy.  Jean Harlow's hair always struck me as a bit surreal, but there is no question that she possessed an earthy sexiness and beauty that was unique in thirties Hollywood.  Although she is the secret savior of the Jordan family, she is hardly an angel, playing someone who is a a former stripper or worse, a current adulteress, and hopelessly uncouth and crude.  But she also manages to be the most charming character in the film.  The film also features one of Lee Tracy's finest screen performances.  Tracy's film career was more or less destroyed shortly after this one due to an international political incident he generated during a moment of extreme inebriation, but he is superb here as Barrymore's long-suffering agent.

The film was one of George Cukor's first great films, and while he is often said to have been a great women's director, the truth is that he was simply superb with people talking.  Cukor always managed to make people simply talking tremendously exciting.

The quality of the print used in the production of the DVD is extraordinary high.  I've rarely seen a DVD with a brighter or cleaner image, and the film looks as if it could have been released yesterday.  I'd have to rate this as one of the cleanest versions of an early 1930s film I have ever seen.",1115337600,116,6398,4.686046511627907
845281,3,6304308477,"It's interesting.  I was for many years a fan of classic American films of the 30's and 40's.  However, now that I am a bit older, I am discovering that there are really only a handful of truly great American films that survive the test of time into the new millenium.

Unfortunately, ""Dinner at Eight"" is not one of them.

Melodramatic, stagy, and cursed with a deadly lack of pacing that the normally talented Cukor must have winced at years later, the film just doesn't hold up as a classic.  Not sure if it wants to be a depression drama, a comedy of manners or a love story, the film settles for slabs of everything and lurches along weighed down with scenes that go on FAR too long.

That said, the film is saved by some fun performances, especially those of Billie Burke, Jean Harlow, Marie Dressler and the great John Barrymore, playing a role not unlike that of himself--an actor who had seen glorious days as a popular matinee idol but who's career was destroyed by alcohol, ego and a fickle public.

For better films from this approximate period, try ""Twentieth Century,""  ""My Man Godfrey,""  ""It Happened One Night"" or the brilliant ""Trouble in Paradise"".",1113177600,13,1166,4.621359223300971

If the film has a flaw it's that it may suffer a bit from staginess, but that is inherent in alot of films from this era.  However, that is compensated by the richness of the writing and performances.  The narrative of the film is really about the activities of the persons invited to the climactic dinner party;the dinner itself is merely an afterthought.  The performance I found most affecting was John Barrymore as a washed-up actor.  He is matched by his brother, Lionel, as a kind-hearted shipping magnate who is facing the collapse of his business.  Wallace Beery and the legendary Jean Harlow are hilarious as the bickering nouveau riche couple.  Marie Dressler lights up the screen as the straight-talking grande dame.  Billie Burke has her moments as the harried party hostess.

John Barrymore, I think, must have drawn from his own life experiences when he played the not so popular anymore matinee idol. Marie Dressler has one of the best lines in film history at the end of the movie when she talks to Jean Harlow. Billie Burke is great too. The sets are fabulous, so is the script and direction. This is one of those timeless films that will be enjoyed by many more generations.",1111190400,7,563,4.423076923076923
845284,4,6304308477,"MGM, the studio with ""more stars than there are in heaven"" had only recently proved their point by putting six of their top talents in one film; ""Grand Hotel"" (1932). A clean sweep at the Oscars, the success prompted David O. Selznick - then a rival producer on the backlot - to devise his own all star melodrama of merit with ""Dinner At Eight"" (1933). The plot is threadbare but serviceable. Affluent hostess, Millicent Jordon (Billie Burke) is so enraptured at the prospect of throwing the society party of the decade that she eschews all other concerns in favor of the frivolities associated with such a swank soiree. Her roster of guests include the boorish social climber, Dan Packard (Wallace Beery) and his much younger wife of hot body but low class, Kitty (Jean Harlow), aging grand dame of the theater, Carlotta Vance (Marie Dressler), family physician, Dr. Wayne Talbot (Edmund Lowe) and desperate has-been movie actor, Larry Renault (John Barrymore). Millicent's husband, the kind-hearted, good natured Oliver (Lionel Barrymore) has just discovered that he is fatally ill. However, acknowledging his wife's lack of feeling for anyone but herself, Oliver decides to forego divulging his diagnosis, presumably until after the party.
What is most engaging and impressive about Selznick's take on the all star spectacle is that, unlike ""Grand Hotel"", he does not afford any one actor particular preference or even attempt to evenly space their on screen time. Rather, there is a strange sense - particularly from a star system as galvanic as MGM's - that the people being observed are just common folk on route to a flashy night on the town. The film also gives DVD audiences their only chance to admire the comedic stylings of one of Vaudeville's most gifted former actresses - Marie Dressler. In girth, stature and poignancy, Dressler is at her personal zenith - delving high comedy and low melodrama with equal panache. At one point in the evening, after having been told by Harlow's character that a book has explained that machinery is going to take the place of every profession, Dressler casually eyes the sultry Harlow from head to toe before commenting, ""Oh my dear, that's one thing you need never worry about.""
Warner Bros. DVD treatment of this classic star vehicle is about on par with their lack luster previous treatment of ""Grand Hotel"". Although the gray scale can exhibit some nicely balanced contrasts, solid blacks and clean whites, more often there is a sense that contrast levels are a tad too low and blacks are more deep gray than black. There is, at times, an excessive amount of age related artifacts for an image that is rarely smooth or easy on the eyes. Film grain is also obtrusive. The audio has been cleaned up but exhibits a fairly noticeable background hiss throughout. The Sharon Stone hosted bio on Harlow - which is all too brief, and a short subject: ""Come to Dinner"" are all the extras you get. A shame.",1109980800,11,2950,4.8902195608782435
845285,5,6304308477,"Priceless cast in one of the best films of the '30's.  A socialite frantically tries to pull off an A-list dinner party as everything crumbles around her at the last minute. Billie Burke (a few years from her turn as Glinda the Good Witch in ""The Wizard of Oz"") is matchless as the fluttery Mrs. Jordan, the wealthy matron. The A-list cast includes Marie Dressler as a faded stage star, both Barrymores Lionel and John, and Jean Harlow as the social-climbing wife of Wallace Beery. The George S.Kaufman-Edna Ferber comedy-drama (based on the play) is good on the screen with George Cukor directing the multi-layered plot and sub-plots that somehow never get confusing. There's too much going on in ""Dinner at Eight"" to go into but suffice it to say it's as completely satisfying now as it was in 1934. A classic to be treasured. While the acting is top notch all round, it's Dressler as Carlotta Vance and Harlow who pull out the stops and nearly walk off with the film. Their meeting at the end results in one of the funniest lines in movie history expertly delivered by Dressler. A must for vintage film collectors. The DVD print is fine. Enjoy.",1109721600,14,1147,4.650246305418719
845286,5,6304308477,"DINNER AT EIGHT is one of those rare films that blur the distinction between comedy and drama.  It is really a ticking time bomb in which a huge star-studded cast plan to converge for a formal dinner given by a secretly broke but still regarded as wealthy Oliver Jordan (Lionel Barrymore)and his wife the social butterfly Millicent (Billie Burke). These two plan the dinner but share the dramatic focus with a large supporting cast and a number of improbable subplots, all of which are neatly tied together by the closing reel.
When DINNER AT EIGHT was released in 1934, the Depression had been ripping apart America's social fabric for nearly four years.  The film contains several pointed barbs that suggest that even in the celluloid world of Hollywood make believe, the crushing reality of broken financial dreams lurks uncomfortably close.  Simultaneously, the advent of talking pictures pushed the silent film industry into the recesses of America's recent memory.  The brothers Barrymore were two of the very few silent stars to make this successful transition.  Here, Lionel, as Oliver, is a sick elderly financier who is given a short time to live by Doctor Wayne Talbot (Edmund Lowe), who keeps himself busy by having an affair with upwardly mobile bimbette Kitty Packard (Jean Harlow), who is married to the crude Dan Packard (Wallace Beery).  Oliver's daughter is Paula (Madge Evans), who has fallen in love with a much older Larry Renault (John Barrymore), a washed up sot of a silent film star who still thinks that huge paydays are in his future.  Millicent plans a sumptuous party whose purpose it was to keep at bay the reality of the Depression that was then staring in through her fancy bay windows.  The comedy drama blending of DINNER AT EIGHT is the natural result of an attempt to fuse the seemingly disparate elements of light drawing room comedy with the collapse of a morality symbolized by the hucksterism of Dan Packard and sleazy social climbing of his wife Kitty.
Director George Cukor succeeds in this fusion by channeling most of the comedy into a subplot of a disastrous marriage between Kitty and Dan.  Their several scenes of marital discord are quite funny as she claims that this upcoming party will make a lady out of her--if it does not kill her first.  The real star, however, is grande dame Marie Dressler, who, as Carlotta Vance, functions as a comedic chorus passing off witty barbs, including the famous closing line double take when Kitty bewails that modern technology will soon render all human interaction, including her own sensual nature, as obsolete.
DINNER AT EIGHT is a genuine pleasure to watch.  None of the more than twenty-five stars is allowed to dominate although each makes maximum use of their screen time.  Part of the joy of watching how laughter could blend into tears was in never being quite sure whether any one scene was meant to elicits gasps of laughter or howls of pain.",1073174400,4,2941,4.871743486973948
845287,4,6304308477,"This movie engaged me from the beginning, casting its line right to my easy chair and reeling me into its all too believable world of human triumph and tragedy.  It is an example of what can happen when strong acting, strong writing and strong direction are brought together by people who DO NOT aim for the lowest common denominator, but rather, for the sophisticated audience who reacts warmly only to quality performance and credible story line.  I also appreciated the structure and pacing, where subplots are introduced and then intertwined, and just the right time is taken to develop characters and story before changing the focus, so I could follow it.
See this for an evening of real entertainment.  The only problem is, it will spoil you for any of the dumbed-down crapola that Hollywood has released in recent years.",1065916800,5,827,4.892857142857143
845288,5,6304308477,"Any movie with Jean Harlow and Marie Dressler is going to be delicious, as this certainly is. One of the greatest of all time. MGM had just completed its star-laden Grand Hotel, and while everyone was idle during early 1933, this stellar cast was assembled to make a movie from the original Broadway play. Marie Dressler, 64 at the time, plays the part of Carlotta Vance(based on Mrs. Patrick Campbell)as she barges into every scene and rubber-faces it when necessary. Most do not realize she was ill with cancer at the time, dying the next year. Louise Closser Hale is delightful as cousin Hattie. Hale died in a car accident later in 1933. The great dislike between Jean Harlow and Wallace Beery in real life shines through in the climax argument they have when his manhandling her looks very real. The wonderful Billie Burke is perfect as the scatterbrained social climber. John Barrymore basically plays himself. Originally, Clark Gable was to play the doctor, and Joan Crawford to play Paula Jordan, but they had prior obligations, so declined. This is a must-see, and is as fresh today as it was in 1933. The quickly-moving plot centres around a zany, social-climbing tycoon's wife and her preparation to have dinner at 8:00 that evening, and trying to assemble dinner guests. The sub-plots are many and are interwoven very well. Comedy and drama both surface and are handled expertly. Not to be missed, this one.",1048636800,3,1419,4.867768595041323

Spoiled beauty Jean Harlow, who always feels entitled, and is constantly rude to the maid such as snapping ""get over here you nitwit!"", and her grizzled hubby Wallace Berry are invited to a dinner hosted by Billy Burke and her husband Lionel Barrymore. Lionel's business is in danger from the deppression and wants Wallace's help  with stocks. I remember Wallace from his very good role as powerful and intimidating big company boss  in ""Grand hotel"". I liked Billy Burke here with her charm, similar to in ""Everybody sing"" with Judy Garland, but she was still best as the good witch of Judy's Dorothy in ""Oz"". Marie Dressler's good as the ailing, aging former stage actress who says ""death, it's just so.. final"". Even back then, there were some people who doubted the afterlife. But if there is an afterlife, I bet that Marie Dressler is grinning down on me now seeing me writing this. Ex silent film star John Barrymore joins them and gives a good performance too. There are numerous other things that keep the film interesting such as a broken engagement, drunkin bickering, and..there is a suicide.  There is the dramatic, but there's also the humor and wit too.  This was a good old style dinner party, but we never see them eating dinner.

The last scene, with Jean Harlow, will leave you rolling on the floor.
The trials and tribulations of many of the characters seem right out of a soap opera but the movie is saved from falling into that catagory by the wonderful comedic scenes and the character of Oliver Jordan (Lionel Barrymore) whom you cannot help but admire.
