8420485,5,B004AM5Q1C,"This dvd is great for not only making cards to sell, but for anyone who likes to be creative.  This dvd can help get the creative juices flowing.  It is something you can use to help youth groups/churches, or other organizations be creative and make a profit from their hard work and ideas.  Some people need a jump start to their creativity.  This dvd can help spark those ideas.  It can be used for new grandparents looking for ways to show off new baby pictures, by sending out cards.  That is why we got this dvd.  Then it dawned on me that the dvd could be a great tool for youth groups to show ideas and market their tallents for fundraising.  The dvd makes good points about how to make a profit.  Look at stores like Target- they have hand made cards on sale for $8, each, as a type of ""designer"" card.  The purpose of this dvd is to encourage that kind of creativity.  The possibilities are as endless as the imagination behind each card.",1388534400,,947,4.323863636363637

8420487,5,B004AM5Q1C,"This inexpensive DVD is a great DIY program. In a simple, down-to-earth manner, it teaches anyone how to create personal greeting cards for all occasions. And the finished cards look so professional! I purchased mine for my mother, who resides in a retirement home, and she has plenty of spare time to make greetings cards for her loved ones, and she loves doing it. In addition, the program shows you how to easily turn this simple hobby into a profitable business. It's perfect for stay-at-home moms and dads looking for additional income. It also makes a great gift for retirees, or folks in between jobs, who might be looking for an easy way to help pay the bills. It makes a perfect stocking stuffier for Christmas, too. I have no regrets.",1384041600,,744,4.687022900763359
