8162581,4,B000LP50TK,"This is a terrific routine if you have some experience in the martial arts. Of course, you have to work on stretching a lot to perform some of these movements. So, do not expect to perform this wushu routine overnight. The movements are not so complicated, but the degree of stretching you need to perform to do these movements is difficult. I recommend doing the movements slowly without the speed and modifying some of the movements until you achieve the flexibility to perform the routine. The description of the movements is good, but you will have to rewind a great deal because the movements are performed quickly.",1370044800,,620,4.803738317757009
