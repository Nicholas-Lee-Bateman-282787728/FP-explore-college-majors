8505547,3,B006WCPRGM,"This is a DVD that I was not familiar with, but since I collect odd animation I decided to give it a chance. From the other reviews on this DVD I learned that this cartoon was based on Star Wars. I have to say that it is loosely based on the 1977 Star Wars. The colors are brilliant, but the animation violence was enough for me to give it a 3 star rating. I only watched one of the episodes plus the bonus CO.P.S feature. I must say that the bonus feature was horrible. It had nothing to do or add to the rest of the animation. I don't remember Jayce & The Wheeled Warriors from the 1970's Saturday mornings' lineup of cartoons. I also don't remember Matel putting out any toys regarding Jayce.
If you like animation violence and silly storylines, then by all means buy this stupid DVD, otherwise pass it up.",1424908800,,809,4.259740259740259

8505549,5,B006WCPRGM,"as a kid, i watched alot of this, even had most of the original 8 volumes that we had in the uk. the whole series is based on starwars characters, by looking, just at the cast you can tell who they are based on. This seris alone is starwars, transformers and inhumanoids all merged together for the perfect space adventure. the artwork on the cover and back is great, and as the cover says you get the best early episodes from the series which is great, because despite it's age and voted 85 of 100 greatest cartoon series in old comic collectable magazine, it has lost none of it's original appeal as a series. The down side is there is no movie to conclude the series, unless you consider the 5 part story in the 2 volume collection as such.",1370476800,4,743,4.314285714285714
8505550,5,B006WCPRGM,"I don't know if I agree with the mention that this series holds up better than the original Transformers.  I'm sure arguments could be made in both directions of that statement.  I will say that the animation is fantastic and the writing is miles above the usual drek that escapes from ""kiddie"" shows.  The only annoyance of the show is the bumbling-knight character, filling the role of other classic ""funny"" characters such as Snarf (Thundercats), Orko (He-Man), and T-Bob (M.A.S.K.)... still very enjoyable though!",1336867200,2,517,5.130952380952381
