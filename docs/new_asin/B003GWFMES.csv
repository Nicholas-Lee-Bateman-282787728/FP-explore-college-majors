8396572,4,B003GWFMES,"This is a good little Pre-Code movie. Nothing earth shattering, but simply a pleasant and agreeable short (68 mins.) light diversion, a ""smart set"" comedy-drama. This movie mainly appeals to me for the charming and well-realized daughter and mother characterizations by young Joan Crawford and Pauline Frederick, and the believability of their vibrant, warm, loving sincere relationship. Picture quality and audio is excellent for a surviving movie of such vintage. I'd give this movie a perfect 5-stars rating if just judging the appealing, captivating, entirely first rate performances by Crawford and Frederick, as the well-matched daughter-mother pair, and for the great quality of the DVD. The rest of the story (specifically Miss Crawford's character's interactions with her romantic suitors), and the two young male leads, on the other hand, are, I feel, weak and strictly average. But, for the two female leads and their characters' winning relationship, and the fact that I love early-'30s movies, this movie is one I'm pleased to own a copy of in my excellent ""keepers"" DVDs collection. Another wonderful Warner Archive release!",1383436800,3,1138,5.435028248587571

The story opens with Di Winter (Pauline Frederick) planning a trip with her married lover, Andr&eacute; de Graignon (Albert Conti). Di had divorced her husband years ago, apparently was judged an unfit character by the court, and had her daughter taken from her and not even allowed visitation. Di then moves to France, and eventually becomes the long time mistress of the wealthy Andre. Andre, in return, furnishes her with a lovely house and clothes to match, servants, and in general a very luxurious lifestyle. Out of the blue, Di gets a letter notifying her that her long lost daughter Val (Joan Crawford) is on her way for a visit. Val turns out to be a good mixture of mom and dad - she has mom's fun loving ways balanced with dad's moral compass.

Val lacks experience with the kind of people her mother rubs elbows with and the high life in general, since she has lived a rather sheltered life. She finds two suitors. Tony is a free spirit who takes everyone as they are with no judgment, but he has no use for marriage. Bob is a more conventional sort and the marrying kind whose parents' ancestors not only came over on the Mayflower, either one of them could easily be confused with Plymouth Rock itself. They are that stuffy and very judgmental. Which suitor and accompanying lifestyle will Val ultimately choose? On top of that Di has lied to her daughter about who exactly owns her house and where her money comes from. To make matters worse Andre is getting tired of paying Di's bills and getting no bang for his buck since daughter Val moved in. All of this together makes for good drama indeed and a great showcase for the talents of all concerned. Plus it was good to see an older woman (Miss Frederick) playing an attractive woman and an object of desire. That's something you'd never see in a popular film today and that's the reason that great actresses with 50 year careers like that of Joan Crawford are likely to remain forever in the past.

The video an audio are in great shape on this early talkie. The DVD-R has no extras and no chapter stops - you may only go forward and backwards in ten minute increments.",1279324800,7,2353,4.492990654205608
