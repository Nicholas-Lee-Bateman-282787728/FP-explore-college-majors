8277902,5,B001AK3S6W,I love Pitbull's music and his sense of humor and presentation cannot be surpassed.  I was up almost until dawn enjoying this DVD.  I only speak and understand English which did not present a problem until family section and I was totally in the dark.  Imagine having to wash someone's skanky feet when losing a bet.  His off the wall imagination and setups are appreciated as you cannot wait to see what will happen next.,1391040000,2,422,4.586666666666667
