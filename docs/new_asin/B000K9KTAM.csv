2685258,5,B000K9KTAM,"As a practicing martial artist for 25 years, the first 10 in the Korean martial arts, I have seen my share of instructional videos. If you want a clear picture of the moves, requirements, and basic form necessary for beginners to advance in the Korean art of Tae Kwon Do, this is the DVD for you. The camerawork, performances, content, and organizational layout of the DVD are of high quality.",1165795200,38,393,4.628571428571429
2685259,5,B000K9KTAM,"As a novice to Tae Kwon Do, I found the DVD very informative. It is a great practice guide; the demonstration is excellent, especially the views from different angles are very useful. The instructions are clear and draw attention to important details. The selection feature on the DVD makes it easy to view, practice any section of the instructions.",1165536000,28,349,4.932203389830509
8155179,4,B000K9KTAM,Good basic DVD for taekwondo beginners.,1483315200,,39,5.666666666666667
8155180,5,B000K9KTAM,I have watched this video. Yes this is a white belt video. They even say so. And as basic as it is I believe it will be a great help to my nephew which has been studying Tae Kwon Do for six weeks now. He is having trouble getting some of the forms right. The class is large and the instructor cannot spend a lot of time with him. Watching his classmates to learn the forms is not the best idea since they have not perfected the forms themselves. His family cannot really help him since no one knows what the proper forms are. I believe between this video and instructors fine-tuning he will excel into a yellow belt and further. I see nothing wrong with this video.,1398297600,,665,4.203125
8155181,3,B000K9KTAM,This is a very basic video. And either I overlooked or they understated that it is only the first in a series of basic videos. This is white belt stuff really.,1392854400,5,159,4.161290322580645
8155182,4,B000K9KTAM,"That is what this video give the kids who want to learn martial arts.  Good against bullying.  One, two, three . . .",1371513600,,116,4.0
8155183,3,B000K9KTAM,"This is a basic video in everything, techniques to production.  Would I have bought this if I knew what was on the video, no. Would I rent it, yes.  I also found the fact that the instructor being a little on the girthy side a little less than inspiring.  The kids, most likely his own, who where treating the filming a little too unserious tended to be a distraction, but a funny one. This is an okay video, but not a great video.",1370304000,2,431,4.168674698795181
8155184,2,B000K9KTAM,This will only help if you have been training taekwondo for a month. Nothing your master can`t teach you.,1226275200,2,105,4.578947368421052
8155185,4,B000K9KTAM,"I have met Mikhail a number of times over the years as we train from the same lineage of instructors.  What some buyers should be aware of is that the techniques contained herein are mainly from Tae Kwon Do in its most traditional sense, and has little to do with modern Olympic Tae Kwon Do.  If you are a student studying the traditional forms as Chung Do Kwan founder Won Kuk Lee taught, such as the Pyong-Ahn and Kuk-Mu family of forms, then you will get value out of this DVD.",1220572800,19,480,4.263736263736264
8155186,4,B000K9KTAM,"It's a good DVD for beginners. I like when the forms are shown
simultaneously from two different angles.
The self defense part is useful. Also, the teacher is good at demonstrating
how to break fall.",1197936000,9,199,4.714285714285714
8155187,4,B000K9KTAM,Haven't viewed the dvd yet since I am giving it to my son for Christmas but was happy with quick delivery.,1196035200,2,106,4.095238095238095
8155188,5,B000K9KTAM,This DVD clearly demonstrates the fundamentals of this sport.  I was impressed with the presentation and recommend it as the best I have seen.,1166400000,10,142,4.916666666666667
