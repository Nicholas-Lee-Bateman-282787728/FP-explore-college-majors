5709629,2,B00CAWF150,"The popularity of this show is modern mystery, though I suppose that just because E4 shows the entire series from beginning to end 5 times daily it doesn't exactly mean that anyone is actually watching it. The Big Bang Theory is so gratingly dated, using styles and techniques that went out of fashion in the early 90s and a character dynamic that didn't work with Joey but somehow is resuscitated by the agonizingly overenthusiastic laughing sheep in the audience. They try to cover it up with an overabundance of pop culture references but I'm not falling for it.

None of the characters are all that likeable. Sheldon is an annoying pedant with almost no redeeming features. Howard cannot get through half a sentence (usually some lame sexual innuendo) without boring me to tears. Raj is never really given anything to do. Leonard fails as the 'straight man' to their weird antics, and his on/off/on/off/on/off/on/off/on/off relationship with Penny is more irritating than Ross Geller's 'we were on a break' schtick from Friends. None of these characters properly develop and the live-audience nature of the show gives every single line of dialogue an overly rehearsed feel turning many scenes in each episode into an unbearable ordeal.

The Big Bang Theory is so phoney and false it's like acid in my face. Live-audience sitcoms are out of style. Laugh tracks in general are out of style. If it were not created by Chuck Lorre this aggravating crap would never have made it to the air.

The two-star rating is merely for Kaley Cuoco's occasional pointy nipples.",1350604800,3,1565,4.942965779467681

I watched seasons 4 through 5 in Marathon fashion.  Very enjoyable. The characters are quirky and very funny. And they are very flawed, which is what makes them so fun to watch. Don't get me wrong, I don't like watching train wrecks - it's painful for me to watch that kind of stuff. But flawed and funny; well that's what makes all of the cast very easy to relate to and enjoy.  Who doesn't have a Sheldon-like character sometime in their life?

5709692,1,B00CAWF150,"I ordered the Seasons 1-5 set of Big Bang Theory because it's one of my favorite shows of all time. Seasons 1-4 played fine. The quality is great, and I thoroughly enjoyed the extras. However, 2 of the 3 disks in the Season 5 set will not play in either of two DVD players in my household. Season 5 was packaged separately from the rest (1-4 were shrink-wrapped together), so perhaps that's why the first 4 seasons were okay.

I'm even more disappointed to see that amazon's return policy means that I missed the window to return this DEFECTIVE product by ... 7 days. I will have to find a more reliable way to obtain quality DVDs.

(edited 08/27/13): In fairness to Amazon, I must add that they treated me fairly in responding to my complaint about this defective product. It was annoying to deal with DVDs that wouldn't play, but the issue was resolved as well as it could have been, under the circumstances.",1377216000,2,910,4.509090909090909

I love the closed captioning and I can finally pause the program to see the directors thoughts on the show, inspirations, and random bits of wisdom.  The show is well thought out and typically fits together like a jigsaw puzzle in the end without ever having to watch prior episodes.  Make no mistake if you don't have attention to subtle details you will miss the humor.  If you can pickup on other peoples quirks, idiosyncrasies, emotions, and thought processes then this show is for you.  If you can't, then you're like Sheldon Cooper in which case you should watch it anyway so you can see all the mistakes you could be making.",1377216000,2,776,4.391608391608392

THIS SET IS BRAND-NEW!!! IT IS NOT PIRATED AND IT WORKS FINE IN A U.S. REGION BLU-RAY PLAYER!!!  And to be honest, my blu-ray player is at least 3 years old...and it probably hasn't been updated in a year...Whatever the blu-rays work and the picture looks great.  I would highly recommend this seller (a2z Blu Ray) and this set to anyone.  It was an awesome deal!  $65.00 for the first 5 seasons...that easily would've been $100 if purchased separately.

This has been PERFECT! Some of the special features aren't that high definition but that's expecting a lot for a show that's still going on.... The only other thing I noticed was that I had my TV settings changed at first which made the graininess of the first episode stand out more but once I changed it back to a better (warmer, less bright) color setting, it made those first 8 minutes a lot less noticeable. Now, the rest of the episodes look perfect! Trust me when I say, don't judge these blu-ray's on the fact that the first scene is grainy because that is something in the show... Not this set. The set is perfect and WELL worth the buy (especially at this price!)!!!",1365379200,,962,4.471590909090909
5709783,5,B00CAWF150,This is my favorite TV sitcom. Having seasons 1-5 on DVD means I can watch any episode any time I want to. The Blu-Ray Disc is very clear and their are additional clips(outakes) one cannot see on other discs. I can recommend this set highly.,1365379200,,241,4.377777777777778

I've read other reviews which make the accusation that these are pirated disks--I sure can't tell any diminished quality of the video, audio, or the disks and packaging. Audio and video quality are first rate. Yes, they are made in the UK, but mine all state that they are ""Distributed by Warner Home Video, a division of Warner Bros. Entertainment UK Ltd.""  For me, there were no skips, jumpy frames, drop-outs, or any technical problems.

Every disk has some extras: behind the scenes, bloopers, cast interviews, etc, and they are all well done. The video is full 1080p, with dts or Dolby audio. Since the disks are not restricted to a particular region, so they will play on any Bluray player sold in any part of the world.

Overall then, this collection of 5 seasons of one of the best modern sitcoms was a great value, and great quality.",1364515200,17,888,4.643312101910828

I laughed at the one review from buyer who cautioned people in US to not purchase because it didn't work in her DVD player. Ummm blu-rays will NOT play in DVD players so don't let the ""import"" scare you.

We seriously watched all the discs as fast as we could because this show is hilarious! It's our new fave and I know we will get a lot of used out of these watching over and over!",1362960000,,569,4.117117117117117

I contacted the company to see about getting a replacement for seasons 3 and 4.  Their advice to me literally was that my blu-ray player was at fault, even though the other seasons worked.  They further asserted that there was no possible way that faulty discs could have passed through their quality control.  With such an arrogant attitude, i believe i will now attempt to get a refund from the company, i literally own hundreds of blu-ray discs, and only 3 other titles have had problems, that roughly works out to about a 1% failure rate, so i'd have to say i'm 99% certain it's not my player.",1362355200,4,720,4.343283582089552

5709853,5,B00CAWF150,"When this show started out I thought it would not last beyond a season. Four super-smart ""geeky"" guys who love to go to the comics store and love to quote Star Trek and debate philosophical issue regarding superheroes trying to connect with the unreachable hot blonde next door. Well the writers of this series keep coming up with new and hilarious new avenues for this show that never seems to get boring.

What is always constant among these characters is both their hatred towards Sheldon, the self-centered egotist who slings insults without a second thought and whose mind that can solve string theory, cannot fathom the most mundane things regarding human interaction. As each of the characters has an innate desire to slay this ""major annoyance,"" they are also inexplicably drawn to him, no matter what ""detailled contracts"" he makes them sign or iron clad rules he makes them follow (each day is assigned a specified meal and activity).

The stories keep evolving for the better, whether it be learning that alcohol can allow Raj to talk to girls, having a Wil Wheaton/ Sheldon Cooper rivalry, finding the perfect woman for Sheldon via an on-line dating service (Amy), having Sheldon and Penny sing ""Soft Kitty,"" having Raj's parents appearring only via Skyppe or whether it's knock ""Penny,"" knock, ""Penny,"" knock, ""Penny!""

And now the show is into its sixth season and nobody cares that the elevator is still out of order! Some of the best scenes happen when they are walking up or down those several flights (how did they move that Time Machine up the stairs?).

TBS seems to have a few nights of marathan episodes each week and I can watch them back to back without getting bored. While a show like Modern Family is funny, the shows seem to all be the same and the characters have not really evolved since the first episode. With TBBT we see Amy evolving to becoming more human and little by little we see Sheldon start to change (he did get jealous of Amy's date with Stuart). Penny has learned to accept Sheldon's quirks and occasionally Raj will slip and talk in front of a girl sans alcohol. I don't think we will ever see Howard's mother on-screen though but we do know that the two people that tame Sheldon are his mother and his twin sister.

I hope the writers can keep up the excellent job on this show for seasons to come and that the actors realize what they have now and don't decide to jump ship just yet.",1359417600,8,2430,4.641860465116279

5709860,2,B00CAWF150,"technically i should've given this review 3-stars (5 stars for each o' the 1st 3 seasons, and 1 star each for seasons 4 & 5......divided by 5 = 3.4), but i chose to xploit the fact that no one had written anything for the 2-star slot, so 2 stars became the shortest distance......anyway

no doubt i'm in the minority here, but i lament the unquestionable loss o' that which made this series truly unique in the 1st place, that which has been steadily losing momentum during the last 2 seasons (and no doubt is continuing to occur in season 6)

i don't always collect things sequentially; so this last xmas i was sent the one season i was missing - s2.  i had picked up s5 while i was visiting family in october cause i actually found a copy for $25 (not even on amazon was that possible back then).  however i held off watching it until i returned home, i even watched disk 4 o' s4 to help set the stage.....however s5 failed to really hold my attention - even after repeated viewing. in fact since then i had also been watching s4 more in an effort to want to like it; yet it simply never solidified into anything i could recommend.  sure there are sporadic moments which made me laugh, but the direction o' the show had quantifiably shifted

in between watching s5 and the arrival o' s2 i read an article in an ish o' entertainment, and while i found myself disagreeing w/ much the author had to say about the show it wasn't until i received s2 and popped in the 1st disk that my suspicions were utterly confirmed.......

the all too predictable focus on relationship conundrums has been steadily eroding the ONLY interesting aspects o' what made this series genuinely original in the 1st place; and if they don't find a way to bring it back then i'm most likely going to give away the last 2 seasons, cause they really aren't as engaging as the first 3.  like many who instantly gravitated to the series i LOVED all the scientific references, the `inside' math jokes, even the cursory celebrations o' nerd culture (despite the heavy-handed emphasis o' dc over marvel); but sadly BBT has become much more about the most superficial trappings o' nerdom rather than about mining the precious nuggets o' humor based on the actual glories o' math & science - and even their awkward xtrapolations into the amerikan social spheres.  it's no accident that their oft touted impressive leap (almost quantum-like given the arena in which it occurred) in viewership coincided precisely during the season when the math & science took an unmistakable backseat to the stereotypical plights o' relationship foibles - that tried & true safe constant o' ALL popular sitcoms.  personally i don't give a lab rat's ass if leonard and penny EVER hook up, they so aren't ross & rachel - that high-water mark which nearly every romantic probability will forever be compared.  however let us not forget that what made this show such a singular phenomenon in the 1st place was the fascinating interactions o' a gaggle o' PhD holders (and their plus one MIT graduate) and their erratic orbits around one another; the pole-star being a particularly eccentric `alpha' nerd

it's bad enough our country scores so low against other nations in the disciplines o' math & science, must we also dumb down our writing skills to cater to such pathetically low xpectations ???",1358812800,,3341,4.663265306122449

He can't talk without holding his left hand in his right hand, he always tilts his head back to talk and looks down his nose,(ok, he's short, but can't he move his eyes?) he always furrows his brow, he has a whiney, inflexible voice and his role in the show is too large. The Howard and Raj characters are much more amusing. There's a bit too much of Penny and too much rap rap rap Penny Penny Penny on the door. That little joke got old quickly. And too much filmed in the apartment or the canteen. Having said all that- I really like it, but Leonard loses a star. Incidentally Only $60 in Oz for the whole package!",1358467200,,839,4.25

5709868,5,B00CAWF150,"In the cult tradition of Spartacus, the halls of every science department now echoes: ""I AM SHELDON""!

Currently into its sixth season, The Big Bang Theory proved to be one of the most funny TV sitcoms ever aired. Even if the show seems to have slowed down form its initial explosive impetus, I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of Frasier and Seinfeld - and Big Bang Theory is consistently brilliant!

Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.

His equally super-intelligent (yet sexually confused at times girlfriend), Amy Farrah Fowler, received a far more enlarged role since the fifth season. However, she was not a very good addition and she unbalances the show. Her character only manages to blur the focus form Sheldon (there is only room for one idiosyncratic genius!), diffuse a number of comically charged situations and gum up the show's flow.

Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself (who Sheldon tries to ""help"" by steering him towards a teaching career), he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny. Which crush, like lunar eclipses, follow a predicted yet unavoidable periodicity.

Leonard tried his hand in a long-distance relationship with his friend Raj's sister, Priya, but he seems to be gravitating back towards Penny once more.

Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD (and Sheldon will never let him forget it). An engineer (whose crowning achievements were a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle and a liquid waste management solution), he also managed to wreck the Mars Rover in hopes of landing a girl (but he made sure no one can prove anything).

The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.

Howard used to be the show-stealer. Whenever he entered the scene you just knew he would offer such an outrageous perceptive that would render you speechless. Now, if only Howard's character was allowed to continue in its stellar trajectory. He has been weighted down by his fiance, Bernadette, who is very likeable, but also is cramping his style. Not to mention that she, slowly yet inescapably, is turning into his scary mother.

Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He takes the ""metrosexual"" lifestyle a little too literal for his own good and he keeps using the ""poor Indian"" defense even if his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley. His character, even in the current sixth season, remains underdeveloped.

Then there is Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends (Sheldon has in fact calculated the exact number of them, extrapolated from a bell-curve that started at 14)- and, obviously, from her neighbors.

The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch, the fish-out-of-the-water) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!

The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?

Keep in mind, however, that the price fluctuates daily and shipping will take a lot longer. Also, I used to have the DVDs, but despite the fact that each season is only on two blu-ray discs, the quality of the video is far and away better than the DVDs. I noticed it immediately.
