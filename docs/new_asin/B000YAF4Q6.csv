3018792,4,B000YAF4Q6,"I took my teenage sister to see this movie last week. If Chris Brown wasn't in it, I don't think she would've been interested. Chris Brown, by the way, really impressed me in this movie. His acting is great and his singing, in my opinion, has improved a lot. I thought he was great in ""Stomp the Yard"" despite his small role and I would love to see him in more movies in the future.

At first glance, ""This Christmas"" seems like a family film. However, if you do watch this with your family, make sure there are no little children around because there are too many inappropriate things in this movie:

1) The mother in the film, Loretta, and her boyfriend Joe, who is a DEACON in a church,  have been living together -in Loretta's house- for the past several years. They're not married and Loretta's youngest son ""Baby"" accuses her of being afraid of marrying Joe due to a bad marriage she had in the past. I thought Joe was going to propose to Loretta at the end of the movie, but it never happened.

3)The oldest daughter, Lisa, has a husband, Malcome, who is cheating on her. While he is in the shower, Lisa confronts him about it. Malcome, not knowing that Lisa squirted baby oil all over the floor, wraps  his lower body with a towel and comes out of the shower. The entire scene is of Malcome slipping and sliding on the bathroom floor with Lisa beating him with a leather belt. Even though Malcome is wearing a towel, he is not fully overed, he's slipping and sliding on the floor AND YOU CAN SEE HIS PRIVATE PARTS AS HE ATTEMPTS TO GET UP OFF THE FLOOR. I saw TOO much. Laz Alonso is an extremely handsome man, but the entire scene looked like S&M to me.

2) The middle daughter, Kelli, has a one night stand with a guy she met at the club. A few days later she sneaks this STRANGER inside her mother's house so they can  sleep together. Supposedly they went to high school together and the guy claimed he liked her back in the day, but I don't know. For a successful Harvad-educated woman getting up in age, I guess Kelli was desperate for a man.

3) The youngest daughter, Mel, brings her boyfriend over for the holidays. They are only boyfriend/girlfriend, but they are allowed to sleep together in the same bed as well as play hanky panky in the closet and it's no big deal even though there is a young niece and nephew and other family members in the house.

Sorry, that I gave away parts of the movie, but this isn't a Huxtable Christmas movie and people need to know this before watching it with children around. But then again, who am I to say what is appropriate and inapproprite?",1196035200,19,2597,4.349173553719008

3019088,5,B000YAF4Q6,I say its worth seeing because I've ignored it every Christmas. Maybe there's been so much Christmas going on until I'm just Christmased out and tired of the jingle bells. However this was recently played on BET's Christmas in July show block where they played nothing but Christmas themed black movies. I have to say I should have watched it sooner. It reminded me not only of how talented Chris Brown is but the other actors that starred in this. If you want something with a comedy splashed here and there with a family theme this is it.,1500854400,,540,4.520408163265306

I was unsure of what he would think.  When it was over he said it was his favorite Christmas movie.  I completely agree.  It is one of my favorites still to this day.  The music is jazzy holiday which gives such warm, fuzzy feelings, which I love.  Some Christmas movies aren't all about Christmas, but this one is and that's what I expect from a Christmas movie.  It's humorous, fast moving, and very sweet.  Definitely a movie you should add to your Christmas collection.",1415836800,,647,4.378151260504202

The people in this film have great chemistry, the music is good, and it just works as a movie.  The reason that it didn't receive the additional star is because it still resembles a holiday movie.  These movies don't typically take many risks at all.  Some people call them ""cookie cutter"".  This Christmas does fall into that category.

Loretta Devine plays the mother of three boys n three girls who have their own lives but during this holiday season their problems become her problems and it all plays out in a dramatic and sometimes very funny way.

Well written, brilliantly casted, and fabulously acted. The major, universal family issues were all accounted for, with some delicious new surprises to boot! I was hugely entertained from start to finish! Even the ""overrated"" traditional ""Black movie"" Soul Train ending, was a joy! I had fun. I was moved to tears, I wanted that fight between the sisters, I needed the ""Make Up"" scene between them. God knows, I was living to see the eldest son give Joe his props and blessings, that Madea and Joe could Love ""Out Loud"". I followed that family into the next TEN YEARS of Xmas gatherings!

I read a lot of the other reviews and I agree with most of what the negative reviewers said to a certain point but I'm one who focus on the positive points . This is a black loving family with a lot of issues but are there for each other and learning as they move forward in life. Yes everyone knows a divorce is nothing to celebrate but the movie didn't focus on the divorce just her moving on the celebrating is in the beginning with adults going through this horrible time to keep them strong so yea for kids its not a good message but for adults I believe MOST should know the kids will be hurt , the wife will suffer a lot of heart ache and so on but again not the focus of this movie. Its true that a lot of men leave out to have the women raise a family on there own but I seen individuals whom had love and respect for one another there was others not married sleeping with there boy/girl friends but that's a fact of life as all adults know what I'm saying is to the negative reviewers is I think adults can handle this and enjoy it for what it is a loving heart warming family Christmas that was great from start to end I would recommend it to everyone .",1355961600,,1300,3.9656488549618323

This movie was surrounded by Christmas trappings, true, but it is all about venerating the devil, it portrays sleeping around, it portrays drinking and violence without redeeming virtue, it is studded with foul language and inexcusable degrees of undress. I confess I didn't watch it to the finish, I'm trying to clean up my mind, not pollute it. I wound up taking heavy scissors and cutting this thing up and filing it with the rest of it's ilk. My advice, if you value your spiritual welfare, don't waste your money or your time with this thing. Excuse me, I'd like to get on my knees now and ask forgiveness for watching as much as I did.

3022376,1,B000YAF4Q6,"""This Christmas"" rehashed the types of themes found in ""Soul Food"" -which is why I did not like this film. Dysfunction rules in this family as it did the family in the other movie I just mentioned. What kind of ""moral"" can you come away with from a movie like these?? 1) Marriage is AWFUL and for the ""weak-willed"" woman, 2) A woman is, therefore, better off involving themselves in one-night-stands or using a certain ""device"" requiring batteries for pleasure, 3)Put yourself above ALL others, 4) Children are mostly ""accidents"" that just HAPPEN to you. And many such depraved ideas were propagated by this movie.

This was supposed to be a warm family movie, but the children in the movie were treated as mere props. It was all about the adults and their vain pursuits. When Regina King's character decided to divorce her cheating, overbearing husband (presented as any typical husband) and father of her two children, there was revenge and a celebratory attitude as if she'd just won the lottery. So sad to see so many African American movies follow this narrative, being that one of the main problems in the community is broken homes and fatherless children. I know, I am African American.",1321660800,14,1193,4.819512195121951

The family values, the wide variety of interpersonal relationship..... A really great movie.",1321315200,,387,4.5285714285714285

This is a story about a family of adult children, returning home for the holidays. The baggage that each of them brings with them is what makes this story so interesting. And to top it off, Mama has a little baggage of her own! In the end though, you are reminded that it's family that counts.

I was loving Chris Brown in this movie. He has made quite a bit of drama for himself since this was filmed. Maybe Chris should watch the movie again and get back in touch with the wise, centered character he played here!",1294099200,,617,4.228813559322034

Ma'dere is the Matriarch who's Los Angeles home is where the vast majority of the story takes place. As with any family gathering there are topics that are best not discussed. When they are discussed here they end up in fights -verbal or physical (an excellent sister-on sister catfight stands out here). One sister is encouraging the siblings to sell the family dry cleaning business and split the profits. One bother is running from loan sharks. One brother is AWOL from the Marine Corps and One sister has brought along the man she's dating at a historically Black college. I really enjoyed this movie, all the casts were magnificent and so beautiful I am  looking forward to watching it again.  This is a Christmas Movie indeed.",1260403200,3,864,4.870748299319728
3022414,3,B000YAF4Q6,"This was an enjoyable but not great movie. All of the actors involved turned in stellar performances. Regina King is one of my favorites and she definitely did not disappoint in this movie. Idris Elba and Columbus Short are so handsome their mere presence made this movie enjoyable to watch.

The family drama, in my opinion, was not plausible. Although it's never really stated, from conversations it appears that Senior, the husband of the matriarch Ma'Dere has been gone for many years. All of her children grew up without him, and are now adults. It just made no sense to me that she'd still be afraid of how they would feel if she divorced him and moved on with her life.

My other issue with this movie was that although it's titled This Christmas, and has lots of Christmas songs playing in the background, Christmas was more of a prop or back-drop for this movie than a major theme. This film could easily take place at Easter, Thanksgiving, or even the 4th of July and nothing about the plot would need to be changed.

But this was an enjoyable movie. It's a great DVD to own and pull out to play around the holidays.",1259107200,5,1126,4.509803921568627

3022434,1,B000YAF4Q6,"Hi Amazon community, this is my first movie review here...

I wish I would've skipped this movie :o(
It just felt like it was a waste of time...
As a comedy, it didn't make me laugh.
As a drama, it shot everywhere but didn't hit a thing.

The only good part, most actors are above average and they really tried their best.

But,the soundtrack felt like it was pushing a bit too much...Like, let's see how many Xmas songs we can put in one Xmas movie?
The story was a whole bunch of family drama stuff that we've all seen before a million times so nothing new there...

My wife and I kept watching and thinking it would get better since most reviewers here recommended this movie, so we kept watching and watching and nothing good, funny or touching ever happened...

IF you're looking for a good Xmas movie, this isn't it.

Oh, white girls can't dance then???",1231372800,2,859,4.405063291139241
3022435,5,B000YAF4Q6,"""THIS CHRISTMAS"" is a very heartwarming movie with excellent performances by all of the actors and actresses.  For us baby boomers, it brings back memories of the old family dinners during the holidays and those infamous Sunday dinners.  The plot is very basic but still holds you in suspense for the final ending.  I watched it twice and will probably watch it again.  The ""Soul Train"" dance line, at the end, is fun!  It's a ""must have"" movie that can be viewed anytime but had special meaning for me ""this Christmas""",1231286400,,519,4.65934065934066

Through it all the Whitfields on Christmas day come together as one at the end, to me that was the highlight of the movie. I can sit and watch this movie a hundred times because the plot and music was outstanding. In these times and days, all families should get on one accord and receive a message from this movie. Time out for so much hatred and violence. I do not purchase violent movies at all. The writers, directors & procducers should STOP making movies that are violent. I get so sick and tired of that mess. Chris Brown's singing was outstanding. I love that song ""THIS CHRISTMAS"", however no one can sing it like Donny & Layla Hathaway. BUY THIS MOVIE PLEASE.

3022457,5,B000YAF4Q6,"There are parts of this movie that remind me of Soul Food - the daughter with a college education who can't cook to save her life, the daughter who didn't go to college but stayed home; she cooks well, has a husband and children and seems to always put the needs of others before her own. I enjoyed Soul Food, but this movie is much better!
Regina King is a beautiful, talented actress who does well in both dramatic and comedic roles. If you want a good laugh, you have got to see her in this movie! Delroy Lindo is cool no matter what role he plays. Idris Elba is a fine actor who brought depth to the film. Whether he's singing or acting it's obvious that Chris Brown was born to entertain. Loretta Devine, I love her down-to-earth demeanor. She seems like the kind of woman who would invite you into her home, treat you like family and wouldn't let you leave without feeding you; she was perfect for the role she played. Sharon Leal - I used to watch her on Boston Public and I'm so glad that she's on the big screen now. Everyone who acted in this movie did well. This one is worth watching not only at Christmas, but any time of the year!",1228176000,3,1144,4.228310502283105
3022458,5,B000YAF4Q6,"With its ""can't miss"" cast, I thought for sure that This Christmas would be a hit...and I wasn't wrong.  Loretta Devine ""M'Dear"" is the matriarch of her family of six (did I miss anyone?)....who has been scarred emotionally by the love of her life...who deserted her and his family to pursue his love for music.  Unfortunately for M'Dear, not one but two of her sons have that same love....leaving her with a fear of further desertion.  Insert also cheating spouses, sibling rivalry, interracial romance....and the constant tug of war between her longtime partner (Delroy Lindo) and her eldest son (Idris Elba), and there is never a dull moment in this flick.  Add to that a great soundtrack...and you have a recipe for success.  Great ""eye candy"" (for both sexes), also.  Don't make the mistake that I did of renting this one....purchase!  Makes a great addition to any DVD library.

There was so much eye candy.. ok but that's not why this movie was great.  The direction was very well done in this movie (good job, Will!).  It has a ""Soul Food"" feel to it with the element of food, family and the typical sibling rivalry issues in all families.  The movie was fun and funny - I enjoyed it through and through.  This is another great movie to play during the holidays when you have a mixed generational group of people to entertain.  It could even inspire some fun activity within your own holiday plans.

The heart's in the right place, but the execution could have resonated more than a substandard holiday greeting.

I really enjoyed watching this movie and will include it in my DVD collection.

Cons:

The church scene did not appear to be an authentic AA church.  I did not buy the scene.  It was very fake to me.

Chris Brown's cover of Otis Redding song just left me feeling flat.  He simply doesn't have the vocals and the physical appeal(manly) to pull off such a powerful song.  It was  watered down and over produced.  However, I am sure the teeny boppers got a thrill.

Pros:

The soul train line at the end of the movie had me laughing big time.  This is what my family does when we get together.  We dance.",1211241600,,821,4.309210526315789

3022508,3,B000YAF4Q6,"This Christmas looked like it was going to pass without any cinematic holiday cheer. Luckily audiences will find a special gift at their local multiplexes from Preston A. Whitmore, a filmmaker whose latest picture comes wrapped up with so much holiday mush that it would be hard for even the biggest scrooge to scowl at its spirited Christmas message

It's the most wonderful time of the year again, and the Whitfield family plans to continue their holiday tradition of bringing the entire clan back home for a few days of presents, good eating and family squabbling. The only problem with This Christmas is that each of the children has brought more than just gifts. Absence without leave, surprise pregnancies, interracial relationships, cheating husbands and angry bookies are just a few of the surprises in store for the family's matriarch, Ma Dear, making it a Christmas that will either tear the Whitfield's apart or bring them closer than they've ever been before.

With This Christmas, Preston A. Whitmore successfully bounced back from his sophomore slump. The choice to ""Crossover"" into the holiday genre is a big move, though looking at the filmmaker's oeuvre, he seemingly defies categorization. Written with heart, This Christmas isn't just impressive for its well balanced drama and comedy. Its ability to transcend its targeted audience to become a holiday film that can be enjoyed by anyone who has ever experienced family dysfunction makes the picture a refreshing surprise.

With an all-star, African American cast including Delroy Lindo, Loretta Devine, Idris Elba and the lovely Sharon Leal, Screen Gems certainly seems to be pushing the racial factor when marketing This Christmas. While this strategy will probably draw in adequate box-office receipts (See Tyler Perry's success), This Christmas will draw the majority of its fans next Christmas when it finds a wider audience on DVD.

Though many of the family's problems translate to touching and humorous bits of cinema, This Christmas ultimately suffers from one fatal flaw, too much conflict and no easy way out of it. There is so much going on, that the tidiest and most satisfying conclusion seems far too difficult to reach. It also seems that the character of Joe, played by Delroy Lindo, has the answers to everything. Able to pacify everyone from street thugs to the U.S. government in a single night, Joe gives Santa Claus a run for his money on this Christmas Eve.

However plausibility isn't the strong suit of the Whitfield family. There are plenty of nit-picky details audiences will pick up on that could easily take them out of the narrative. While viewers might scoff at bits such as buying the picture-perfect Christmas tree on Christmas Eve, the performances from the actors, tight editing and gorgeous cinematography will help get you through This Christmas.

If filmmakers should write what they know, then Preston A. Whitmore certainly knows Christmas and family far better than war or basketball. A solid holiday outing sure to please any audiences that comes across the film, Whitmore's well executed dramady should resonate far longer than This Christmas.

3253289,4,B000YAF4Q6,"I took my teenage sister to see this movie last week. If Chris Brown wasn't in it, I don't think she would've been interested. Chris Brown, by the way, really impressed me in this movie. His acting is great and his singing, in my opinion, has improved a lot. I thought he was great in ""Stomp the Yard"" despite his small role and I would love to see him in more movies in the future.

At first glance, ""This Christmas"" seems like a family film. However, if you do watch this with your family, make sure there are no little children around because there are too many inappropriate things in this movie:

1) The mother in the film, Loretta, and her boyfriend Joe, who is a DEACON in a church,  have been living together -in Loretta's house- for the past several years. They're not married and Loretta's youngest son ""Baby"" accuses her of being afraid of marrying Joe due to a bad marriage she had in the past. I thought Joe was going to propose to Loretta at the end of the movie, but it never happened.

3)The oldest daughter, Lisa, has a husband, Malcome, who is cheating on her. While he is in the shower, Lisa confronts him about it. Malcome, not knowing that Lisa squirted baby oil all over the floor, wraps  his lower body with a towel and comes out of the shower. The entire scene is of Malcome slipping and sliding on the bathroom floor with Lisa beating him with a leather belt. Even though Malcome is wearing a towel, he is not fully overed, he's slipping and sliding on the floor AND YOU CAN SEE HIS PRIVATE PARTS AS HE ATTEMPTS TO GET UP OFF THE FLOOR. I saw TOO much. Laz Alonso is an extremely handsome man, but the entire scene looked like S&M to me.

2) The middle daughter, Kelli, has a one night stand with a guy she met at the club. A few days later she sneaks this STRANGER inside her mother's house so they can  sleep together. Supposedly they went to high school together and the guy claimed he liked her back in the day, but I don't know. For a successful Harvad-educated woman getting up in age, I guess Kelli was desperate for a man.

3) The youngest daughter, Mel, brings her boyfriend over for the holidays. They are only boyfriend/girlfriend, but they are allowed to sleep together in the same bed as well as play hanky panky in the closet and it's no big deal even though there is a young niece and nephew and other family members in the house.

Sorry, that I gave away parts of the movie, but this isn't a Huxtable Christmas movie and people need to know this before watching it with children around. But then again, who am I to say what is appropriate and inapproprite?",1196035200,19,2597,4.349173553719008

However this was recently played on BET's Christmas in July show block where they played nothing but Christmas themed black movies. I have to say I should have watched it sooner. It reminded me not only of how talented Chris Brown is but the other actors that starred in this.

3255827,5,B000YAF4Q6,"I had seen this movie in the theater with my mom, before my husband and I were even together, and loved it, so I asked him to watch it with me our first Christmas together.  I was unsure of what he would think.  When it was over he said it was his favorite Christmas movie.  I completely agree.  It is one of my favorites still to this day.  The music is jazzy holiday which gives such warm, fuzzy feelings, which I love.  Some Christmas movies aren't all about Christmas, but this one is and that's what I expect from a Christmas movie.  It's humorous, fast moving, and very sweet.  Definitely a movie you should add to your Christmas collection.",1415836800,,647,4.378151260504202

The people in this film have great chemistry, the music is good, and it just works as a movie.  The reason that it didn't receive the additional star is because it still resembles a holiday movie.  These movies don't typically take many risks at all.  Some people call them ""cookie cutter"".  This Christmas does fall into that category.

Loretta Devine plays the mother of three boys n three girls who have their own lives but during this holiday season their problems become her problems and it all plays out in a dramatic and sometimes very funny way.

Well written, brilliantly casted, and fabulously acted. The major, universal family issues were all accounted for, with some delicious new surprises to boot! I was hugely entertained from start to finish! Even the ""overrated"" traditional ""Black movie"" Soul Train ending, was a joy! I had fun. I was moved to tears, I wanted that fight between the sisters, I needed the ""Make Up"" scene between them. God knows, I was living to see the eldest son give Joe his props and blessings, that Madea and Joe could Love ""Out Loud"". I followed that family into the next TEN YEARS of Xmas gatherings!

I read a lot of the other reviews and I agree with most of what the negative reviewers said to a certain point but I'm one who focus on the positive points . This is a black loving family with a lot of issues but are there for each other and learning as they move forward in life. Yes everyone knows a divorce is nothing to celebrate but the movie didn't focus on the divorce just her moving on the celebrating is in the beginning with adults going through this horrible time to keep them strong so yea for kids its not a good message but for adults I believe MOST should know the kids will be hurt , the wife will suffer a lot of heart ache and so on but again not the focus of this movie. Its true that a lot of men leave out to have the women raise a family on there own but I seen individuals whom had love and respect for one another there was others not married sleeping with there boy/girl friends but that's a fact of life as all adults know what I'm saying is to the negative reviewers is I think adults can handle this and enjoy it for what it is a loving heart warming family Christmas that was great from start to end I would recommend it to everyone .",1355961600,,1300,3.9656488549618323

3256871,1,B000YAF4Q6,"I bought this movie hoping to add it to our fine Christmas movie collection. Christmas is about Jesus, the perfect, the one and only holy Son of God. This movie was surrounded by Christmas trappings, true, but it is all about venerating the devil, it portrays sleeping around, it portrays drinking and violence without redeeming virtue, it is studded with foul language and inexcusable degrees of undress. I confess I didn't watch it to the finish, I'm trying to clean up my mind, not pollute it. I wound up taking heavy scissors and cutting this thing up and filing it with the rest of it's ilk. My advice, if you value your spiritual welfare, don't waste your money or your time with this thing. Excuse me, I'd like to get on my knees now and ask forgiveness for watching as much as I did. It is not about Christmas.",1322870400,5,818,4.496644295302014

The movie has a lot of characters and sub-plots so the viewer is never bored.  From sentimental moments to hilarious, it is greate viewing.  It's not Oscar winning but neither are most Christmas movies.  The music is also great.

3256873,1,B000YAF4Q6,"""This Christmas"" rehashed the types of themes found in ""Soul Food"" -which is why I did not like this film. Dysfunction rules in this family as it did the family in the other movie I just mentioned. What kind of ""moral"" can you come away with from a movie like these?? 1) Marriage is AWFUL and for the ""weak-willed"" woman, 2) A woman is, therefore, better off involving themselves in one-night-stands or using a certain ""device"" requiring batteries for pleasure, 3)Put yourself above ALL others, 4) Children are mostly ""accidents"" that just HAPPEN to you. And many such depraved ideas were propagated by this movie.

This was supposed to be a warm family movie, but the children in the movie were treated as mere props. It was all about the adults and their vain pursuits. When Regina King's character decided to divorce her cheating, overbearing husband (presented as any typical husband) and father of her two children, there was revenge and a celebratory attitude as if she'd just won the lottery. So sad to see so many African American movies follow this narrative, being that one of the main problems in the community is broken homes and fatherless children. I know, I am African American.",1321660800,14,1193,4.819512195121951

Ma'dere is the Matriarch who's Los Angeles home is where the vast majority of the story takes place. As with any family gathering there are topics that are best not discussed. When they are discussed here they end up in fights -verbal or physical (an excellent sister-on sister catfight stands out here). One sister is encouraging the siblings to sell the family dry cleaning business and split the profits. One bother is running from loan sharks. One brother is AWOL from the Marine Corps and One sister has brought along the man she's dating at a historically Black college.

3256911,3,B000YAF4Q6,"This was an enjoyable but not great movie. All of the actors involved turned in stellar performances. Regina King is one of my favorites and she definitely did not disappoint in this movie. Idris Elba and Columbus Short are so handsome their mere presence made this movie enjoyable to watch.

The family drama, in my opinion, was not plausible. Although it's never really stated, from conversations it appears that Senior, the husband of the matriarch Ma'Dere has been gone for many years. All of her children grew up without him, and are now adults. It just made no sense to me that she'd still be afraid of how they would feel if she divorced him and moved on with her life.

My other issue with this movie was that although it's titled This Christmas, and has lots of Christmas songs playing in the background, Christmas was more of a prop or back-drop for this movie than a major theme. This film could easily take place at Easter, Thanksgiving, or even the 4th of July and nothing about the plot would need to be changed.

But this was an enjoyable movie. It's a great DVD to own and pull out to play around the holidays.",1259107200,5,1126,4.509803921568627

I wish I would've skipped this movie :o(
It just felt like it was a waste of time...
As a comedy, it didn't make me laugh.
As a drama, it shot everywhere but didn't hit a thing.

The only good part, most actors are above average and they really tried their best.

But,the soundtrack felt like it was pushing a bit too much...Like, let's see how many Xmas songs we can put in one Xmas movie?
The story was a whole bunch of family drama stuff that we've all seen before a million times so nothing new there...

My wife and I kept watching and thinking it would get better since most reviewers here recommended this movie, so we kept watching and watching and nothing good, funny or touching ever happened...

IF you're looking for a good Xmas movie, this isn't it.

Oh, white girls can't dance then???",1231372800,2,859,4.405063291139241
3256932,5,B000YAF4Q6,"""THIS CHRISTMAS"" is a very heartwarming movie with excellent performances by all of the actors and actresses.  For us baby boomers, it brings back memories of the old family dinners during the holidays and those infamous Sunday dinners.  The plot is very basic but still holds you in suspense for the final ending.  I watched it twice and will probably watch it again.  The ""Soul Train"" dance line, at the end, is fun!

I can sit and watch this movie a hundred times because the plot and music was outstanding. In these times and days, all families should get on one accord and receive a message from this movie. Time out for so much hatred and violence. I do not purchase violent movies at all. The writers, directors & procducers should STOP making movies that are violent.

I enjoyed Soul Food, but this movie is much better!
Regina King is a beautiful, talented actress who does well in both dramatic and comedic roles. If you want a good laugh, you have got to see her in this movie! Delroy Lindo is cool no matter what role he plays. Idris Elba is a fine actor who brought depth to the film. Whether he's singing or acting it's obvious that Chris Brown was born to entertain. Loretta Devine, I love her down-to-earth demeanor. She seems like the kind of woman who would invite you into her home, treat you like family and wouldn't let you leave without feeding you; she was perfect for the role she played. Sharon Leal - I used to watch her on Boston Public and I'm so glad that she's on the big screen now. Everyone who acted in this movie did well. This one is worth watching not only at Christmas, but any time of the year!",1228176000,3,1144,4.228310502283105
3256955,5,B000YAF4Q6,"With its ""can't miss"" cast, I thought for sure that This Christmas would be a hit...and I wasn't wrong.  Loretta Devine ""M'Dear"" is the matriarch of her family of six (did I miss anyone?)....who has been scarred emotionally by the love of her life...who deserted her and his family to pursue his love for music.  Unfortunately for M'Dear, not one but two of her sons have that same love....leaving her with a fear of further desertion.  Insert also cheating spouses, sibling rivalry, interracial romance....and the constant tug of war between her longtime partner (Delroy Lindo) and her eldest son (Idris Elba), and there is never a dull moment in this flick.  Add to that a great soundtrack...and you have a recipe for success.  Great ""eye candy"" (for both sexes), also.  Don't make the mistake that I did of renting this one....purchase!  Makes a great addition to any DVD library.

I know I will be playing it out myself.  =)  I will also be buying it as Christmas gifts for my family members.,1221004800,,386,3.9358974358974357

3256999,5,B000YAF4Q6,"The reason I visited the theatre to see this movie was because there were some real actors, i.e. Regina King, Loretta Devine, Delroy Lindo, and Idris Elba.  I knew this movie would not be some garbage with such people.

I really enjoyed watching this movie and will include it in my DVD collection.

Cons:

The church scene did not appear to be an authentic AA church.  I did not buy the scene.  It was very fake to me.

Chris Brown's cover of Otis Redding song just left me feeling flat.  He simply doesn't have the vocals and the physical appeal(manly) to pull off such a powerful song.  It was  watered down and over produced.  However, I am sure the teeny boppers got a thrill.

Pros:

The soul train line at the end of the movie had me laughing big time.  This is what my family does when we get together.  We dance.",1211241600,,821,4.309210526315789

As long as your kids are at least 13, I am sure that they won't be shocked by anything in this movie.  There is nothing worse in this movie than what can be seen everyday on network t.v.

3257005,3,B000YAF4Q6,"This Christmas looked like it was going to pass without any cinematic holiday cheer. Luckily audiences will find a special gift at their local multiplexes from Preston A. Whitmore, a filmmaker whose latest picture comes wrapped up with so much holiday mush that it would be hard for even the biggest scrooge to scowl at its spirited Christmas message

It's the most wonderful time of the year again, and the Whitfield family plans to continue their holiday tradition of bringing the entire clan back home for a few days of presents, good eating and family squabbling. The only problem with This Christmas is that each of the children has brought more than just gifts. Absence without leave, surprise pregnancies, interracial relationships, cheating husbands and angry bookies are just a few of the surprises in store for the family's matriarch, Ma Dear, making it a Christmas that will either tear the Whitfield's apart or bring them closer than they've ever been before.

With This Christmas, Preston A. Whitmore successfully bounced back from his sophomore slump. The choice to ""Crossover"" into the holiday genre is a big move, though looking at the filmmaker's oeuvre, he seemingly defies categorization. Written with heart, This Christmas isn't just impressive for its well balanced drama and comedy. Its ability to transcend its targeted audience to become a holiday film that can be enjoyed by anyone who has ever experienced family dysfunction makes the picture a refreshing surprise.

With an all-star, African American cast including Delroy Lindo, Loretta Devine, Idris Elba and the lovely Sharon Leal, Screen Gems certainly seems to be pushing the racial factor when marketing This Christmas. While this strategy will probably draw in adequate box-office receipts (See Tyler Perry's success), This Christmas will draw the majority of its fans next Christmas when it finds a wider audience on DVD.

Though many of the family's problems translate to touching and humorous bits of cinema, This Christmas ultimately suffers from one fatal flaw, too much conflict and no easy way out of it. There is so much going on, that the tidiest and most satisfying conclusion seems far too difficult to reach. It also seems that the character of Joe, played by Delroy Lindo, has the answers to everything. Able to pacify everyone from street thugs to the U.S. government in a single night, Joe gives Santa Claus a run for his money on this Christmas Eve.

However plausibility isn't the strong suit of the Whitfield family. There are plenty of nit-picky details audiences will pick up on that could easily take them out of the narrative. While viewers might scoff at bits such as buying the picture-perfect Christmas tree on Christmas Eve, the performances from the actors, tight editing and gorgeous cinematography will help get you through This Christmas.

If filmmakers should write what they know, then Preston A. Whitmore certainly knows Christmas and family far better than war or basketball. A solid holiday outing sure to please any audiences that comes across the film, Whitmore's well executed dramady should resonate far longer than This Christmas.
