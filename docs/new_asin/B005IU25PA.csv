4710010,4,B005IU25PA,This is a unique movie about a transplant doctor whose families Sikhism faith cause the young doctor to make some radical decisions he later comes to regret.  It is a movie worth watching and if anyone cares to research what the Sikh's faith is about they will be surprise at what they learn.,1365811200,3,292,4.509433962264151
4710011,3,B005IU25PA,"It is about Shik immigrants (after the partitian in India) wh settled in Canada and became quite successful  The main turning point is not well described and could be from almost any country in the world at some time or another.  The movie does not ""enlighten"" on to historical significance and numbers effected. They use the word ""holocust"" which I feel should be ""saved"" for the plight of the people affected in Nazi Germany.",1363478400,,427,4.756756756756757
4710012,5,B005IU25PA,"The description of the film on Amazon might make it seem a bit trite. It is not of the very highest quality as a ""film"" -- no citizen Kane here. And it might be seen as just another ""struggle to maintain one's integrity"" film. But that would be selling it quite short.

The film interweaves some very serious issues in medical research and clinical practice with the challenges of maintaining ethnic identity in North America. First let me say that almost nothing is said about Sikh religious beliefs, but the emphasis is on how important community and tradition are to them and the turban becomes a symbol of that in the film. The doctor's struggle to keep or abandon his turban in order to advance his dreams of medical progress is mixed beautifully with his struggle to advance his dreams of medical progress and save lives in the face of the business model for medical research and clinical treatment. Religious beliefs come in because it is part of his Sikh belief to give and do good and serve others. That is why he became a doctor.

He was lured to move from Toronto to Detroit to begin an organ transplant center based on his own research. In the US the business model dominates in medicine, however, whereas in Toronto there is virtually universal coverage and he would have been able to do everything to save a patient. Not so in Detroit for a patient that does not have adequate insurance and it is tearing out his heart. At the same time, he is being passed over for leadership because he does not look as good with his turban and dark features as another doctor when it comes to fund raising. How much should he compromise his integrity in the new system in the US? Abuse adds to abuse. And he has isolated himself from his support community of Sikhs  back in Toronto. All this tears fiercely at his heart.

The problems with medical research and patient care in the US are real and serious for everyone. The problems with maintaining ethnic identity are real for many people. After all, even atheists can have a struggle to maintain their identity in a society where there are so many believers. Thus there is a certain universal quality to the film even though it might seem ethnic.

The Sikhs reminded me in a way of the Jews who have endured great suffering to maintain their identities. Then that bitter history adds all the more to the importance of keeping their traditions alive for them and to the importance of their identities.

I had not known about the historical persecution of the Sikhs and so this was an eye-opener. The film offered me pause to think seriously about general matters of human identity as this man struggled to maintain his identity as a healer and as a Sikh. I may never look at a turban the same way again.",1358985600,12,2754,4.553535353535353
4710013,2,B005IU25PA,"Ocean of Pearls has a good plot. However, the casting is not credible. Omid is a Persian playing an Indian. He is also much too young to be a highly paid, successful surgeon. The film is a nice attempt for beginning actors and directors but certainly not worth 5 stars.",1347840000,,269,4.4
4710014,5,B005IU25PA,"Ocean of Pearls has been a very insightful experience into the world of Sikh religion. Coming from Malaysia, a country where there are an estimated number of 130,000 Sikhs, I was aware that Sikhism was a separate religion from Hinduism, Buddhism and Islamism. Though equipped with that knowledge, I was surprised to find that I had learnt such a significant amount on the Sikh culture.
I found two conflicts within the movie especially thought provoking. One being the struggle to oppose the forces of racism in the modern world derived from the misunderstanding of Sikhism, and the other being his internal psychological battle between compromising the traditional Sikh practices in attempt to gain the image of being ""normal"" in society.

 I watched this at a Cranbrook showing during my Senior year today. IT was a very very powerful film. It spoke to me even though I am not Sikh. This film needs to be sold SO I CAN BUY IT NOW.",1328486400,16,932,4.782608695652174
4710015,5,B005IU25PA,"This movie highlights the struggle one Sikh man deals with balancing his spiritual identity with his work goals.

4710019,5,B005IU25PA,"Such a great film- I wasn't sure if it was going to be great or not but without expectations it was one of the better developed films I have watched in eons.
I love how the son, a surgeon drifted away from his own values only to find out the battles were there no matter what avenue I chooses. The hospital he transferred to began their subtle undertones of hatred in ways only those of us who are the target would understand. And eventually his returning to the 'fold' I highly recommend it- No matter how educated people are the ignorance prevails. I could relate in ways though probably if we compare situations it is nothing alike but being Irish in London in the 1970s it was a constant battle to get through a day without feeling slighted- Classifieds or jobs would be given, not to the most deserving but to others- others not Irish (as a fashion model I saw this first hand) and outside flats it would rwad (no Irish and no Blacks) it became the normal. Then the Ugandian Asians arrived and  the hatred was diverted- This film will recall memories and will bring understanding and hopefully healing .....A beautifully made film. Worth watching! The actors  were so believable too. Great work!",1496188800,2,1200,4.576744186046511

4710039,5,B005IU25PA,"Complex, no easy solutions or happy endings, wonderful subtle and expressive acting (especially by Abtahi and Rawat, in the small scenes). It is about the importance of making a stand for one's principles without judging conscious compromise for some perceived higher good. These are secular humanist principles that transcend any specific religion and are not even unique to atheists.
Please don't expect to learn anything about Sikhism from this movie (unless you think you learned about Christianity from Ben Hur).
The only hiccup in the storyline was the protagonist's unawareness of Partition, he had to have suspected, questioned and wondered, and filled in some of the blanks in his father's story himself.",1478995200,,713,5.375

4710100,3,B005IU25PA,"So let me get this straight. US hospital board offers promising Canadian Sikh surgeon chairmanship of their program, but then balks when he shows up wearing a turban. Like they didn't already know he was a Sikh? I assume they interviewed him for the job, saw his picture, knew what he looked like? Then he performs cutting-edge surgery to save a woman's life, only to have the board prefer a lesser surgeon for the chairmanship because he's, you know, white, follows rules better and doesn't wear a turban. Totally unbelievable. Also gives preference to socialized medicine (not mentioning long waits and how people can be denied care there, too), and makes Christians look kind of lame. But then it's supposed to be from a Canadian Sikh perspective, so you have to expect that.

As just a movie, it's okay. Kind of a love story involved, though pretty weak, kind of torn between two women, though not much happens, conflict with his father, though that turns out kind of predictable. Dissatisfying ending, also not very believable. But I give it three stars for the sincerity of the actors and ""stay true to your conviction"" theme.",1443139200,,1132,4.835051546391752

4710105,5,B005IU25PA,A wonderful movie which depicts the dilemma of a Sikh wanting 'to fit in' when his religion demands that he 'stand out' in order to publicly demonstrate a religious way of living (and believing in One God). An important film about the pressures of prejudice and bigotry (which are normally the purview of out-and-out racists) from the professional liberal class who see only a turban and beard and immediately have a knee jerk reaction confusing a Sikh with a Jihadi Muslim.

4710133,3,B005IU25PA,"The actors:
The leading actor was too young to be an accomplished doctor.
His mother was too young.
The head doctor, as an African American I would have expected to be more racially tolerant.

The plot:
The central character found an excuse to not bed with his Sikh girlfriend, but had no such compunctions with his American girlfriend.
The central character cut his hair and stopped wearing a turban at work to better blend in, which seems absurd since he kept his scruffy beard and of course his brown skin. Just the act of not wearing a turban, to my mind was a clear character demerit that could not be overlooked by his bosses and colleagues.

On the positive side:
I learned much about the history and culture of the Sikhs, such as their dedication to public service.
The characters were generally likable.
The scene at the airport where the doctor encounters intolerance and then saves the boy was compelling.
The lack of a definitive end was appropriate (where would they go? Punjab or Detroit).",1421020800,2,1003,4.725714285714286

4710162,2,B005IU25PA,"My friend, a Sikh, and I, of Indian non-Sikh heritage, both born and raised in the USA, watched this film for about 20 minutes and had to stop because of the ridiculously over exaggerated stereotypes. At one point we wondered how the ""Indian"" actor didn't scoff at the screenwriters about how ridiculous the stereotypes were and how far from reality they were, until later learning the actor isn't even of Indian heritage, so that explains that. Despite her jumping ship and not watching, I decided to watch it in entirety...
The clichs were abundant, the acting was pretty painful (especially the mother who switched from a horrible Indian accent to no Indian accent consistently inconsistently). And it was obvious there was no medical input into the screenplay scenarios (we're both physicians and were laughing at the ridiculousness of the scenarios they portrayed). Yes folks, we do not trust lay people to be able to care of a simple knee scrape and instead don on sterile surgical gloves in the same manner in which we operate...
Do we think this is a glimpse into Indian or Sikh culture or the Indo-American experience? No. Do we think this is an over-exaggeration of racism in North America? Absolutely. While we have experienced racism and discrimination in our lives, our experiences haven't been to the extent as demonstrated in this film. While South Asians might be a minority of the North American population, they do make up over 30% of the physician population in North America and many do hold high level positions within their clinical settings. But yes, nepotism does exist such as in the movie, but that's irrespective of ethnicity.",1410048000,3,1653,4.9496402877697845
4710163,5,B005IU25PA,Nice movie,1409788800,,10,4.5
4710164,4,B005IU25PA,"Simple, quiet film full of important issues, e.g., choices we make in life, being true to oneself, not compromising one's principles, etc.  Also examines ethical issues in healthcare, e.g., the best care going to those with the most money, patients being viewed as means to a profitable end, etc.  It plays like an after-school special, a made-for-TV movie (albeit a fairly good one).  As others have said, it's predictable, formulaic, nothing earth-shattering but if the subject matter is of interest to you, you may like it.

Sikhs are from India, slightly reminiscent of Quakers, emphasize selflessness and live their lives in service to others (ALL people) and are a unique, intriguing people.  Their religion is like no other, they accept other faiths as equally valid, live amongst others, and don't proselytize (seek to convert anyone), though everyone is welcome to attend their devotional services.  They're one of the few faiths that accords equal status to women (have done for centuries).  Sikh men never cut their hair (for women that's optional), and wear turbans in public, and as depicted in the film, are often mistaken for Arabs and suffer post 9/11 discrimination.  Both men and women are chaste until marriage.

***MILD SPOILER*** This is a simplistic but heartfelt, well-meaning tale about a brilliant physician and organ transplant researcher who is tempted to violate the tenets of his faith in order to achieve professional goals, further his career and advance medical science.  Chock-full of thorny ethical, moral, medical, religious and cultural issues, e.g., prejudice and tolerance, all presented simply and clearly (yet not in a preachy, overbearing way).  It covers a LOT of ground, but quite subtly so.  Though it's not likely to win any awards and won't knock your socks off, its stars are appealing, and it moves along at a good clip.  I found it absorbing.

HIGHLY recommended for preteens, teens and young adults- thought provoking.  It would make a great classroom teaching tool, too, regarding all the issues above, plus the temptations of casual sex versus the merits of saving sex for marriage- handled in an honest yet decorous fashion (couples are shown kissing passionately, but it stops there).  Also demonstrated is respect for one's parents, elders.",1409011200,9,2295,5.195652173913044

4710186,5,B005IU25PA,"This movie is in English, so I didn't have to read subtitles. It also doesn't have Bollywood songs.

It clearly shows the identity struggles people go through when they go to a different culture.  Each person has to come up with their own answers as to how much they are willing to change and what traditions they will hold firm, as the doctor did in this film. He is a Sikh who moved from Canada to the U.S. thinking he will head an organ transplant unit.

It seemed to me that all three of the women - the mother, the girlfriend and the coworker - had the same basic personality.  Since it is based on a true story, it may just be a quirk that they were that similar in real life, or maybe he wasn't that observant as to their differences. It also seemed strange to me how clear the discrimination was.  In my life, I find that things aren't that clear. Is it my skin color, my place of birth, and my religion that keeps me back? Or is it the fact that I'm a woman, or I'm not as good looking, or am I not as articulate, or maybe it was that mistake that I made last month?

I would like to think that American doctors too are appalled at not being able to help people without any or with insufficient insurance, but have come to see it as a way of life and don't feel they can do anything about it.  Coming from Canada, where this isn't an issue, he can see more clearly that it is unacceptable.",1387670400,,1398,4.117647058823529
