8513012,5,B0079T8SEA,"I saw this video in our hotel room in Honolulu before our cruise began, and I had to have it because it was so wonderful. So, I ordered it through Amazon for $15 so it would arrive before we got home. We took the Blue Hawaiian Helicopters tour of the Island of Hawaii and bought the DVD of our tour (wonderful!!), and could have bought this ""Visions of Hawaii"" video for a reduced price of $15 - same price as I paid online.
The DVD of our tour was nice, but not terrific. The ""Visions of Hawaii"" video was a perfect reflection of our wonderful vacation and our amazing, $500 helicopter ride. If you don't buy any other memento of your trip to Hawaii, get this video. But hey, they have great prices on Aloha shirts at ABC stores, just $30 for two cotton shirts. I haven't washed the shirts yet - I may have a different story after I have to iron them....",1394064000,,855,4.219512195121951

8513014,4,B0079T8SEA,"I bought this DVD used on Amazon. I was born and raised in Hawaii, but I've never seen the islands like is is depicted in the DVD. While some of the narration can come across as melodramatic, I think it was a sincere and mostly successful effort to show the islands in a way that you can't possible see them in a rental car or tour bus, along with a little history and science that you would not likely hear on a visit to Hawaii. It is a film that shows the natural beauty of Hawaii as shot from a helicopter, with scenes of places that are inaccessible except from the air. It gave me a newfound reverence for Hawaii.",1378944000,3,618,4.158333333333333
