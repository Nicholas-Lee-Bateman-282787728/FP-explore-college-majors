For everyone familiar with Joe's work at Walt Disney Imagineering, he is an extremely passionate and interesting guy.  This is a very enjoyable film that documents Joe's personal journey to a remote part of the world that most of us will never visit, all for a great cause.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1450656000,,478,4.8765432098765435

8734742,5,B015WKAH9Q,"I was able to view this film at a festival in DC. It is absolutely beautiful. It is not so much about the snow leopard as it is about Mongolia, a haunting landscape to put it mildly. And its about the people, who are warm and friendly, a stark contrast to the cold empty beauty of the land. And its about the journey to paint this place and raise money for a wonderful cause. Get the DVD, it won't disappoint.",1447632000,2,409,4.125
