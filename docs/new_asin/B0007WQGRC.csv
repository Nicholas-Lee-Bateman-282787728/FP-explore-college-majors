2247308,5,B0007WQGRC,"They don't make great movies like this anymore. This film is genuinely creepy, I love the scene where the girls are swimming in the pool at the rv  park....I've watched this over 10 times and everytime I find something new  to like. Great acting all around, and a killer ending.",940982400,2,278,4.54
2247309,5,B0007WQGRC,"RACE WITH THE DEVIL is a 70's B drive-in movie that's better than 80% of the ""A"" films released that decade. It's a wild ride, lots of fun, lots of chills, and (most importantly) lots of Warren Oates at his  grumbling-best. Oates and Peter Fonda make a great team in a film that is  equally scary and nutty.
This film is of note to any Tarantino fans,  especially those who dig FROM DUSK 'TIL DAWN. The two films are very  similar (supernatural evil confronting travelers in Texas...) and Tarantino  almost completely plagiarized a scene in this film: Warren Oates has a  speech in which he discusses the ""self contained"" advantages of  traveling in a Winnebago - the speech shows up near the beginning of DUSK  TIL DAWN when Juliette Lewis, Harvey Keitel, etc. discuss their own  Winnebago. Definitely an interesting steal by QT.
I can't blame Tarantino  for stealing the bit, though. It's a great bit, and an underseen film, so  why not rip it off? And I have to admire him for loving this film. It's a  terrific ride.",927331200,3,1020,4.605555555555555
2247310,4,B0007WQGRC,"What really struck me about this movie is that it`s very believable. These normal everyday people take a vacation in their motorhome somewhere in rural Texas. As soon as the sun goes down they witness a satanic sacrafice  across the river from their camp.

2247365,5,B0007WQGRC,"Obviously there are a ton of conventions and icons in this movie that one would consider to be just plain corny by today's standards but it is amazing how well this film holds up in terms of it's basic ideas and intentions. Don't watch it and judge the costumes, the attitudes, or the look and feel of the time it was made, let all that go. We have to remember or understand that ""cult-type worship"" was a big, scary deal in the 70s. This movie is only several years removed from the sensational Manson Family murders and trial so this film's premise was very creepy for it's time.

So if you can propel yourself back to a simpler time and let the outdated elements slide, you'll enjoy a number of genuinely creepy moments in this film that will definitely give you pause the next time you decide to take your friends in your brand new motor home out on an extended trip cross country.",1470700800,,885,4.396341463414634

Like Deliverance, it's go out to the country for a trip... bad things happen.
Lara's character is interesting because she seems to have a sixth sense in that she senses bad vibes.

2247395,3,B0007WQGRC,"It's one of those It's-so-bad-it's-good type of movies, which I happen to love---right up there with ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" and ""Showgirls."" The acting is kind of horrible and the situations the characters are involved in with roaming bands of devil worshipers in seemingly every town they set foot in is completely over the top. However, it's entertaining to the point of being downright comical at times, which is why I watch it during the rare moments I'm able to catch this flick on regular television. The power of Lara Parker brought me to this movie initially, as I've been a Dark Shadows fan for a long time, and was interested in seeing Ms. Parker play a character so unlike the Angelique Collins character she is most known for. It was interesting seeing her play a screaming ingenue as opposed to the deliciously wicked villain I'm most used to seeing her as. If you're looking for some prime time acting with lots of scene chewing, this movie is not it. However, if you're looking for some mindless entertainment with unintentionally funny moments sprinkled throughout, complete with devil worshipers who never know when to quit, this movie is definitely for you.",1462406400,,1185,4.900497512437811

2247446,3,B0007WQGRC,"Released in 1975, Race with the Devil stars Peter Fonda, Lara Parker, Warren Oates and Loretta Swit as two couples harassed in their RV by a group of Satanists in central Texas after accidently witnessing a sacrificial murder.

This is a decent horror/thriller with quite a bit of action, mostly of the car-chase variety, but its held back by its lack of depth and routine style. Theres a secret group of Satanists in central Texas and they seem to be everywhere and COULD be anyone, even the sheriff and his deputies, but this is the extent of the films depth. In one sense theres nothing wrong with this approach because there are serious Satanists out there and some of them have been known to engage in human sacrifice; Adolfo Constanzos Mexican cult in the late 80s is a good example (for which the 2007 movie Borderland is loosely based). Satanists and human sacrifice have been around for centuries. So its a great story idea, but its necessary to add meat to the bones, so to speak, to maintain the viewers interest. If the filmmakers cant do this then they have to make up for it with exceptional thrills. While there are thrills in Race with the Devil they're rather pedestrian and on the level of the average 70s TV movie. Speaking of which, more than anything else Race with the Devil comes across as a prosaic made-for-TV movie. Still, its worth catching (or owning) if you like the stars and the subgenre, just don't expect anything exceptional.

The movie runs 88 minutes and was shot in areas West of San Antonio, Texas.

2247503,5,B0007WQGRC,"I had seen ""Race With The Devil"" many years ago, and it still holds its head up as an excellent horror film.  The late (and great) Warren Oates, Peter Fonda, Loretta Swit, and Lara Parker are all outstanding as RV vacationers in Texas who find themselves being chased by a coven of violent Satanists, after Oates and Fonda happened upon a creepy nighttime ritual around a bonfire - people dancing around the bonfire, stripping off their hooded cloaks, chanting in some weird language, while the ringleader, wearing a frightful-looking devil/goat mask, stabs to death a young blonde woman. Interestingly, this particular scene was incorporated into another, very recent film, ""Devil's Knot"" - about the West Memphis Three murder trial - but, oddly, it was never acknowledged in the ""Devil's Knot"" credits; it's the scene in which Vicki Hutcheson makes up her bogus story about meeting Damien Echols for a nighttime ritual.  Copyright issue?

Very face-paced and exciting, ""Race With The Devil"" is a wild roller coaster ride of suspense.  The relentlessly pursuing Satanists seem to be everywhere: at a public library, a gas station, a general store, an RV park, a hony-tonk bar and grille, a public swimming pool - even a small-town sheriff, to whom Oates and Fonda report the ritual murder, seems to be one of the devil worshipers.  Scary and very involving, with a shocking surprise ending, ""Race With The Devil"" is definitely worth watching.",1402876800,2,1443,5.046218487394958

2247513,1,B0007WQGRC,"Well, you have two couples in an RV who are spotted at night viewing a satanic worship ceremony and then the chase begins.  Only bad scripting such as this could make the lead characters so stupid, doing obviously all the wrong things such as: After finding out the local police and town are in on the occult, they prepare to leave town, but stop to have their back window repaired before leaving, blabbering about the ritual and plans to tell the big city police as the local overhears it during his repairs of the missing window. Next, their carefree attitudes lead them to stop for more recreation and then happily leave the RV unattended. The director could at least have made the perils more convincing instead of making the lead characters fall in traps from shear stupidity (Ex. like Romero made the zombies run in his later movies instead of stumble around to give the characters an excuse for getting caught). Then the road chases begin and after watching them fend off the villains for the entire movie, the ultra poor ending arrives as the occult surrounds the RV out of nowhere and the lead characters meet their doom.

2247518,4,B0007WQGRC,"The story of ""Race with the Devil"" is simple. Two business partners running a motorcycle factory in San Antonio, Roger (Peter Fonda) and Frank (Warren Oates), go on a vacation with their wives Kelly (Lara Parker) and Alice (Loretta Swit). Their trip to a Colorado skiing resort should be a nice one with their brand new RV. On the way, however, they witness a cult ritual murder, which turn their holidays into nightmares.

The most impressive thing about the Jack Starrett thriller is its great car actions that live up with the name of ""Race with the Devil."" There are lots of amazing stunts and they did them without using digital effects. You watch vehicles overturn and tumble off the road, and they are actually driving them. It's 1970s, time of ""Bullitt,"" ""French Connection, "" and ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" (no, not the remake).

Like Steven Spielberg-directed ""Duel"" made four years before, paranoia also plays an important role in the story. You are not quite sure what should be trusted, or what should not. The concept is not particularly original now, but in ""Race with the Devil"" it is still effective.

""Race with the Devil"" is a kind of film you stumble upon TV, and without knowing much about the cast or the director you keep watching it because of the strength of the story. It is a well-made low-budget occult thriller, of which scenes (especially the ending) will be imprinted in your mind long after you have seen it.

2247520,5,B0007WQGRC,"What can you learn from 'Race With The Devil'? Lots of things, as it turns out. For instance, if you're being chased by Texan satanists whom you've witnessed murder someone, it's probably not a good idea to let the alcoholic in the group do all the high speed driving. Also, if he wrecks the vehicle because he's been drinking since midday and you actually manage to get it back on the road, don't let him drive it again. To that effect, if there's a sneaking suspicion that you're still being followed by the satanists after escaping, recognize that it's not the appropriate time to go out to the bar with people you've just met and let the alcoholic who will be driving again that night drink even more.

If you are a woman, testing your vocal chords and lung capacity with shrill noises and crying IS an option, but remember also that you possess arms and legs, which enable you to walk, run and even punch and kick things, should the notion strike you. If everyone giving you directions appears to be keeping you from your destination rather than assisting you, it could be time to invest in an actual map. If you are eighty-two miles away from your destination after a seemingly endless assault from your enemies and the alcoholic suggests pulling over for another drink, politely decline, and continue to safety. Finally, if you yourself are a satanist and are attempting to stop a person or people who happen to be driving an RV and who make frequent stops for alcohol and the subsequent RV accidents, might you try slashing the tires of the RV to immobilize them, rather than slashing the tires of the motorbikes strapped to the back that clearly are not their primary mode of transportation?

2247522,5,B0007WQGRC,"Fans of the gothic soap opera ""Dark Shadows"" will want to see ""Race with the Devil.""  It stars the beautiful Lara Parker as Kelly Marsh.  Her husband Roger (Peter Fonda) and friends (Warren Oates and Loretta Swit) are terrorized and pursued by Satan worshippers as they travel the countryside in their RV while en-route to Amarillo, Texas.

  Lara Parker is most famous for her role as the diabolical Angelique on ""Dark Shadows.""  A Satan-worshipping witch, she would harm anyone who stood between her and her beloved Barnabas Collins, a vampire.  Many times Angelique was merciless.  Parker also starred in an episode of ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker.""  She was a witch working as a model who wanted to kill her way to the top of the fashion industry.  (Incidentally, both ""Dark Shadows"" and ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" were directed by Dan Curtis.)  Therefore it is ironic to see Lara Parker in a role where she is tormented by witches.  Her performance in ""Race with the Devil"" is an excellent one as it was with all her projects.

  ""Race with the Devil"" has the same Satanic conspiratorial elements of ""Rosemary's Baby.""  The helpless vacationers can't trust anyone as they race towards Amarillo.  While watching this horror film, I kept hearing Rosemary Woodhouse screaming, ""They're all witches!""

  An excellent cast, suspenseful chase scenes, and an open, downbeat ending make ""Race with the Devil"" a must see for all fans of occult horror.  Fans of Lara Parker and ""Dark Shadows"" will also want to see this film.  It is interesting to see the gorgeous Parker in the role of victim rather than victimizer.

  Anchor Bay has provided a great presentation of ""Race with the Devil.""  It is shown in a widescreen presentation of 1.85:1 and is replete with full-length audio commentary from Lara Parker, an interview with Peter Fonda, and theatrical trailer.

We can always talk about plot holes, and there are a few of them in the movie, but they did not compromise the overall joy of watching it.

The only thing was wrong was the ending. Ok, it added to the notion of sheer terror, but I think they cheated the audience just for the sake of a twisting end. Why? We were led to care about the four main characters, all of them likeable people (and with good job done by the actors), only for them to die without even a glimpse of hope to escape...

2247525,5,B0007WQGRC,"This is, without question, my favorite movie of all time. It has all the elements I love: a motor vehicle chase (in a brand new '75 Winnebago) and Warren Oates teamed up with Peter Fonda.

The premise is pretty simple: Two couples hit the road in a groovy Winnebago, the men witness a Satanic cult ritual late at night in the middle of nowhere, and the cultists only find out when Loretta Swit sticks her head out of the motor home to screech ""Fraaaaannnk....it's late...come to bed!"" From that point on, all hell (pardon the pun) breaks loose and audiences are treated to some great chase scenes, some creepy small town folks, and a bunch of snakes where they ought not be. Fonda and Oates were friends onscreen and off, and it showed. Their easy camaraderie is really the glue that holds this film together. Two friends, scared and running for their lives, do what they can to fight back. In addition to Swit, Lara Parker (Angelique on Dark Shadows) played the other wife and she too did a fantastic job screaming and acting terrified.

The defining moment of the movie for me was near the end when the now nearly destroyed, but still somehow running Winnebago approaches a roadblock. There's a bus by the side of the road and some kids standing nearby with adults, watching curiously. But Oates' instincts were spot on: ""I don't believe a school bus on Sunday.""  And he plows right on through.

2247531,3,B0007WQGRC,"I'll watch just about any movie starring Warren Oates; he's simply one of the most under-rated actors in history.  Unfortunately, he's made a few clunkers, such as this over-heated occult thriller.  Oates and Peter Fonda are partners in a racing business, and they take an RV vacation with their wives (Loretta Swit and Lara Parker).  When they get tired of driving through Texas, they abruptly swerve off the road and randomly park their RV.  It's about the least attractive vacation spot since Leatherface's meat shack (""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was not coincidentally released a year earlier).  Unfortunately, they happen upon a human sacrifice in the Texas dessert.  When they're spotted, they take off, but the chase goes on much longer than they expected.

""Race with the Devil"" is really a rather silly movie, but it somehow manages to be surprisingly enjoyable.  Mostly, it's the stark 70s atmosphere and grindhouse b-movie vibe; plus, the ending car chases are rather good for their time.  Of course, the movie is also completely unbelievable - from the multitude of small towns along the highway that seem to be in on the plot to the pathetic attempts of the sacrificers to off the protagonists to the laughable dialogue to the way the actors seem to be somewhat embarrassed by the proceedings.  However, if you manage to set aside the silliness, ""Race with the Devil"" is not half bad - more like 1/3 bad.",1212883200,,1415,4.932489451476793

One of my favorite lines from this movie (hope I'm getting this right!) was when Oates and Fonda are drinkin' outside the Winnebago and they are basking and bragging about their business success, money, and situation as friends. ""Look at us, we built it man! We really built it, man!"" lol

2247539,5,B0007WQGRC,"Thanks to Quentin Tarantino, these days ""Grindhouse"" has become quite the trendy retro label.  Having seen major theatrical release and having been a major commercial success in its day, ""Race With the Devil"" is actually technically a cut above most of the movies lumped into this category.  But I would still say that this movie is very much a gem of the Grindhouse era, and quite successfully fulfills all the aspirations of that era's films.

In fact, I would go so far as to argue that Tarantino's own contribution to his recent ""Grindhouse"" double-feature, ""Death Proof"", owes a great debt to ""Race With the Devil"", and it is certainly one of the films that defines the genre of road-based action that Tarantino was trying to emulate.

This film brings together several strands of popular culture then current in the mid-70s.  First of all, there is the kind of unease and near-paranoia about rural America already seen a couple of years earlier in ""Deliverance"".  Second, there is the occult element fueled by the whole occult boom/Satanic panic caused by films like ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"".  And third, there is the whole road movie genre, which Peter Fonda had already contributed to in a slightly different way a few years earlier in ""Easy Rider"".

""Race With the Devil"" tells the story of two couples who hop in their huge motor home (Wow, it even has a microwave oven in 1975! I didn't know they were available that early.) and take off for a road vacation driving from Austin Texas and heading for the ski slopes of Colorado.  But somewhere in the wilds of rural Texas, while parked for the night, they happen to witness a human sacrifice by some Satanic worshippers.  After reporting the incident to the local police, they assume everything is hunky-dory and continue on their way. -- But that's when all the fun starts.

This movie is light on characterization, but heavy on the action -- which is exactly what this kind of movie needs.  The movie really succeeds in maintaining a high level of tension throughout, along with an escalating atmosphere of paranoia.  -- Who'd a thunk it that there'd be so many danged Satanists among them rural Texas rednecks?

The movie itself looks great, and this DVD also comes with a cool bonus interview with ""Race With the Devil"" star Peter Fonda today, as well as trailers and a poster & still gallery.  Nice work, Anchor Bay!

So in conclusion, I would highly recommend this one for your home Grindhouse.  How about a 70s vacation-from-hell double-bill with ""Deliverance"", or maybe a 70s road action triple-bill with ""Vanishing Point"" and that other Peter Fonda classic ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry""?

Just make sure to have lots of popcorn handy, and try not to miss the stickiness of those good ol' real Grindhouse floors too much. ;)",1187568000,,2800,4.822175732217573

It seems that everyone in the part of Texas that they are in is part of the cult as they are hounded every step of the way after reporting the incident. Car chases, snakes, animal cruelty, RV cruelty, and random violence to road signs ensue.

  This is a great paranoid chiller(as most post Watergate movies were) where everyone is out to get our heroes, and no one is to trusted. This is one of the best Drive-In movies of all time! The ending is one that you will never forget and stays with you long after the credits roll.

  The cast is pitch perfect, full of some of the best character actors of all time and the pace is lighting quick. I hear that a remake is planed, well if the ones they have done lately are any sign, they can't improve on this Great Little Chiller!",1176508800,5,1358,4.212355212355212

Frank and Roger{Warren Oates,Peter Fonda} take their wives{Laura Parker,Loretta Swift}on a vacation to Colorado. During a rest the two men witness a Satanic Ritual across the water. They are spotted and the chase is on! The thing that made this movie was as a viewer pointed out was that these people are normal looking. This added much to the creepiness. I always loved the pool scene. Its funny how Laura Parker always gets the stares and not Loretta Swift. The director Jack Starrett has a small role as a gas station attendant. Its filled with car chases which was popular back then and not so much today. I have to keep in mind too that this was 1975 and low budget.

The movie is still somewhat scary and suspensful in a ""B"" movie sort of way.  The DVD has some good extras to it like the interview with Peter Fonda.",1173312000,,449,4.36144578313253
2247546,4,B0007WQGRC,"""When you Race With the Devil, you better be faster than Hell!"" screams the trailer for one of the all-time great irresistible chase movie premises: vacationers Warren Oates and Peter Fonda inadvertently witness a ritual killing and find themselves and their wives pursued in their RV by a bunch of unrelenting Satanists. And these aren't any old Satanists - these are Texan Satanists, and darn well connected ones too. Pretty soon it's looking like the whole of the Lone Star State is part of a Satanic conspiracy, and thankfully it's one that involves lots of car crashes. While it doesn't make quite as much of the idea as it perhaps could and the great ending completely defies logic, it's still as much fun as it sounds. It's not a great movie by any means, but as Peter Fonda says on the DVD it was never meant to be: it was just about having a good time with it (though I'm guessing that original director Lee Frost didn't have such a great time since he got replaced by Jack Starrett). Unfortunately, but perhaps predictably, there is a remake in the works.

Anchor Bay's DVD is a good package, featuring a good 1.85:1 widescreen transfer with decent extras - a 17-minute featurette including an interview with Peter Fonda, audio commentary by producer Paul Maslansky and actress Lara Parker, stills and poster gallery, 3 radio spots,  original theatrical trailer and trailers for The Entity, Quicksilver Highway and Ghost in the Machine.",1172361600,2,1446,4.826612903225806

It stars Peter Fonda and Warren Oates as two buddies who buy an RV and take their wives on a cross country trip. They have a pretty cool dirt bike race between the competitive friends and there is some nice riding in that scene. Also this movie is full of some pretty cool stunts. These are even more cool when you think that back in the day people actually rode those bikes, drove those cars and did all the stunts. In a day of CGI this is just amazing. The story is not Shakespeare but it is fun as the couples run across a ritualistic murder and are then chased by the cult. The paranoia and true fear grows and grows as they race across country in fear of their lives.

2247552,3,B0007WQGRC,"I will let others review the film, which is one of the finest American made thrillers of the 1970's. My issue is with Anchor Bay's DVD.

RACE WITH THE DEVIL was a 4:3 open matt shoot which would have then been shown on a theater screen through a mask to produce a 1:85 (or thereabouts) LBX picture. The problem is, folks, that we aren't watching this on a drive-in screen or what have you -- Anchor Bay masked the picture to 1:85, losing about 1/4 of the screen information and shaving the tops of everybody's heads off. They also used a direct to digital transfer process from a negative, allowing Adobe colors to then be arbitrarily assigned to hue tones in the ranges of millions of shades. Problem is that in 1975, Deluxe only used photochemical color that produced ranges of the thousands of hues. Look at how beet-red everyone's faces are.

The promotional spot bonuses are nice and of course any kind of commentary from the contributors on these films is a compliment to any fan of the movie. But unless you have a widescreen high-end 16x9 screen to watch this on, you're better off scooping up one of the old VHS releases shown in the correct fullframe and transferred from a developed print that used the correct color. Specifically you want the Key Video release from 1985, since Ted Turner's Fox Home Video ""digitally remastered"" the film in 1993, losing some of the rough edges you see on the Key Video release.

That's why the DVD is valued at about $8. It's nice, but only if you have a modern day 16x9 setup and/or don't care about whether or not the picture is an accurate representation of what was originally produced in 1975. One other bit of joyful news: the scene with the satanic ceremony & the *VERY* brief frontal nudity was optically censored as early as the 1985 Key Video releases, and may have been fogged for the theatrical version as well to maintain a PG rating, since in 1975 there was no PG-13 consideration. Anchor Bay did not fog the nudity, the film just came that way.

It's still a classic though, the culmination of the Erotic Witchcraft cult horror boon of the 1970s, and George Miller must have seen it before making THE ROAD WARRIOR.",1148947200,4,2175,4.569230769230769
2247553,4,B0007WQGRC,"As low budget horror movies go, ""Race With The Devil"" has aged well. The plot is simple--two couples en route to Aspen for a long overdue skiing vacation, end up in the wrong place at the wrong time, and witness a human sacrifice. The rest of the film deals with their attempts to escape their pursuers, who happen to be modern day witches! Peter Fonda, Warren Oates, Loretta Swit and Lara Parker are the couples in question, and R.G. Armstrong is the local sheriff they enlist to help them. All the performances are fine, especially the vastly underrated Oates, who is only now receiving the acclaim long due him, (he has since passed away) and his acting is as compelling as ever. The just-released DVD includes a commentary from producer Paul Maslansky and Lara Parker, a retrospective documentary with Peter Fonda, trailer, still and poster galleries and radio spots.

2247556,4,B0007WQGRC,"Anybody that's traveled in an RV knows that it can be hell on wheels if you're not getting along with your fellow travelers. It's even worse when you stumble upon devil worshipers sacrificing a woman right outside your door. A low budget minor horror classic, ""Race with the Devil"" finally arrives on DVD courtesy of Anchor Bay in a deluxe release that probably had a budget nearly as large as the original film release itself.  A pair of couples (Peter Fonda, Lara Parker, Warren Oates, Loretta Swit) traveling by RV to go skiing in Colorado observe what they think is an orgy at first. When it turns into murder and it's clear that it's part of some satanic ritual, they have to run for their lives as the cult pursues them. One of a series of low budget horror movies that are memorable from the 70's, ""Race with the Devil"" was an example of the only type of independent filmmaking that could be made because it was designed for a quick shoot, quick profit and with a specific target audience. ""Race with the Devil"" represented the type of low budget independent films that were being done in the 70's. I thought for a long time that ""Race with the Devil"" was a made for TV movie in the mold of ""The Night Stalker"" or ""The Norlis Tapes"" (another made for TV horror film that deserves to be unearthed) when I first caught it on late night during the late 70's-early 80's.

A surprisingly great looking transfer for this vintage horror film. Anchor Bay has done a superb job in bringing ""Race with the Devil"" to DVD. There's the expected grain issues but there's no analog defects that I can detect and it's clear that Anchor Bay pulled this from a recent print of the film. The film grain isn't the result of the transfer but of the stock and condition of the original negative. It's not even an issue for a film made in 1974 in my mind.  It actually adds texture to the film and to the atmosphere as well. The mono sound comes across crisp and clear and isn't clipped or compressed. Leonard Rosenman's atmospheric period score sounds quite good within the limitations of the presentation.

Anchor Bay DVD producer Perry Martin has included all the bells and whistles here. We get the original theatrical trailer, radio ads, photo galleries as well as promotional stills and posters from theatrical exhibits of the film from around the world. This was the third film that Warren Oates and Peter Fonda made together. They enjoyed each other's company and worked extensively throughout the 70's. There's also an excellent featurette on the making of the film featuring Fonda discussing the making of the film. Featuring clips from two other films that Fonda made with Oates, Fonda discusses the water balloon and pie fight that concluded the shooting of the movie. Oates was a bit surprised commenting that, ""this never happened on a Peckinpah movie"". Fonda explained that this was the crew's way of expressing how much fun they had making the movie. ""Go with it Warren"", was his response. Writer/director Perry Martin makes liberal use of clips and behind-the-scenes photos to illustrate what Fonda discusses in the featurette. Great job yet again Perry!

A very involving commentary track featuring co-producer Paul Maslansky (""Police Academy"") and actress Lara Parker (""Dark Shadows"") moderated by Perry Martin. Martin keeps the discussing moving asking lots of great questions about the making of the movie. Maslansky (who provided behind-the-scenes photos from his personal collection) discusses everything from the fact that they had no ending and created it by using previously shot footage to the remake that he pitched (and is being made this year for release next year). Parker shares many of the behind-the-scenes stories on the making of the movie that one would expect about joking around but also discusses the concern they had working with a real rattlesnake and her own suggestion for how the remake should end.

A terrific job by Anchor Bay in presenting this psychological terror story on DVD. The extras are great and any of the major studios would probably just dumped this on the market without anything in the way of extras so kudos to Perry Martin for doing such a great job with the budget he had for extras.",1125273600,2,4232,4.7904109589041095
2247557,1,B0007WQGRC,"I read somewhere that 'Race With The Devil' was a great '70s horror flick that was getting a new DVD release.  The article made the film sound pretty sweet so I bought the DVD.  I watched the film, then went back, got the article, defecated on it, and then set it on fire.

'Race The Devil' is about two lame couples in a lame RV driving cross-country to Colorado to go on a lame vacation.  Along the way they stop in Buttcrack, Nowhere to spend the night and happen to run across the lamest bunch of Satanists ever.  The Satanists then start chasing the RVers and wackiness ensues.

I realize that this movie was made in 1975, but it just doesn't hold up well at all.  Peter Fonda, in his too tight polyester and aviators, is skeevier than a convicted child molester.  Warren Oates looks like he's one cocktail away from the Betty Ford clinic.  And the two chicks are downright irritating and ugly.  Not to mention every action they undertake is completely stupid.  They're running from Satanists and what do they do?  Stop at some town to go swimming in the pool.  Do you think those lame Satanists found them or not?  Total lameness.

2247560,4,B0007WQGRC,"Bout freaking-A-time! I have been waiting for this dvd FOREVER!!! On my birthday on July 29, I happen to be in a dvd store and I see a different Peter Fonda DVD on a shelf which makes me ask the question I always ask and yet know the answer; ""I was wondering if you have a release date for Race With The Devil?"" Not only does the guy have an answer but he says it shows we have 6 in stock! I was like... no way. It HAS to be a different movie. Has to be. Sure enough we walk over to the shelf and there it is; RWTD. I'm totally freaked. Totally. Not only that but it has extras!!

I really didn't care about the cover art as I stood there in the store though now reflecting on it it seems a shame that Warren didn't make the pic. Beyond that it's a fairly awful Photoshop chop job, even the font is not what it should be; I much preffered the racing stripes.

Looking beyond all that, and having viewed the extras I still say, for the price it was great, let alone the fact I would I have paid ANY PRICE. I had to import ""Magic"" from Korea, I'm still looking for ""The Stepfather"", ""Race With the Devil"" was just another one of those movies I love I could never find, ""Sybil"" being another. Where are these? Anyway, the Peter Fonda interview isn't that great but the commentary is quite revealing and quite awesome:)

I'm surprised that according to all involved the movie did as well as it did. Most people I know have never heard of this. Plus the action is kinda ""Sunday Afternoon TV"" but what I always loved about this movie was the chemistry between Warren and Peter, and wouldn't you know it (though I never knew it) they had made two other movies before this. I knew the chemistry was just right and turns out there was a reason.

Odd too how Warren was ""Frank"" giving Loretta many lines where she said the name ""Frank"" which always conjuers up old terrible himself Frank Burns.

I love just about everything about this movie, though the bike sequences tend to make the movie drag in parts, I love all the bit characters from Sherriff Taylor, to the couple in the RV park, to all the gas station guys, everyone just seemed suspiscious without really doing much to provoke it.

Lastly, the ending. I have always loved this and while it did leave it open for a two parter, what it really did was leave this movie open to your imagination as to what would happen next. I say they were able to start the RV and get away, but how much farther could they run? How wide spread was this cult? Those and many more questions should really be answered in the form of a novel. Because to try and recast this to extend the story now would be a train wreck inside of an RV; alas you can never recast Warren, Peter, Loretta, and Lara, they made this movie what it was.

NOTE: Dear Hollywood, please DO NOT try and remake this movie. It is quite clear you no longer have any ideas we all want to see, but we all have our memories so please do not tarnish them with your awful remakes.",1122854400,2,2974,4.216168717047451
2247561,5,B0007WQGRC,"I first watched this movie in the summer of 97 and waited to this day for it to come out on DVD. I think it is an excellent thriller.

The plot mainly consists of two couples vacationing in Texas via a mobile home and accidentally witnessing a satanic ritual where a woman gets sacrificed. The group of devil worshippers spots them and hence the ""race with the devil"" through Texas begins. Everywhere the couple goes, they encounter members of the cult who wish to kill them, from the town sheriff, to the local mechanic, to the vacation trailer park. Anyone and everyone could be a member.

The movie has some good action sequences. Two which stand out are a high speed chase where the two men have to fight attackers on the motorhome and the scene where they encounter snakes in the home placed their by the satanists.

The ending is absolutely spectacular. Not many endings in movie history will top that one. Sorry, but I cannot give it away.

I don't watch films for nude content, but I strongly object to receiving one that has been altered to cater to current political interest.

2247563,4,B0007WQGRC,"Take a moment and think about the worst vacation you ever had...I've had a few doozys, but I think the absolute worst involved a time when I was in Florida and I got an ear infection for a few days and my activities were confined to laying on my side and administering liquid antibiotics into my ear via a medicine dropper.  My point is everyone has had at least one vacation that didn't turn out as expected, but I think few could top the nightmare encountered by the two couples in the film Race with the Devil (1975), when they inadvertently incurred the wraith of a backwoods cult of Satanic devil worshippers.  Co-written by Wes Bishop (Chain Gang Women, The Thing with Two Heads) and Lee Frost (Policewomen, Dixie Dynamite), the film was directed by Jack Starrett, who also appearing in a number of films, but many may remember him from is role as the purposely stereotypical western curmudgeon Gabby Johnson from Mel Brooks 1974 film Blazing Saddles.  Starring in Race with the Devil is Warren `Quaker' Oates (Dillinger, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia) along with Peter `One Toke Over the Line' Fonda, who, by the way, is set to appear in the new Ghost Rider film as the character of Mephisto.  Also appearing is Loretta `Hot Lips' Swit (""M*A*S*H"", Freebie and the Bean), Lara Parker (""Dark Shadows""), R.G. Armstrong (Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, White Lightning), along with co-writer Bishop (he plays the character of Deputy Dave), and director Starrett, in his seminal role as `Gas Station Attendant'.

It seems two married couples, Frank (Oates) and Alice (Swit) Stewart and Roger (Fonda) and Kelly (Parker) March are finally taking a vacation, after five, long years building up a now successful motorcycle dealership.  For the occasion Frank has gone balls to the walls and popped for a brand new, 32-foot motor home with all the modern conveniences, at least modern in 1975 terms.  Their plan is to drive from Texas to Aspen and enjoy some snow skiing, but events conspire to make this a trip they'll never forget beginning with Frank deciding to find a secluded area to park the RV and rest for the night.  It's around this time Frank and Roger witness a strange gathering or robed individuals dancing around a fire, performing some sort of ritual that culminates in the sacrifice of a young woman.  The men, deciding it's time to leave (uh, yeah, I think so), accidentally arouse the attention of the group, and thus begins a nightmarish journey of escape and survival as the deadly cabal are determined to keep their secrets, even if it means following this RV to hell and back...

One thing I learned while watching this movie is that Satanists are an extremely persistent bunch...they really don't know when to quit, that, and one should watch out for low bridges, especially if you're perched on top of an RV...anyway, I've been looking forward to this film being released onto DVD for quite some time, as I think it is an excellent example of, despite a low budget, a film can still be entertaining and really well done given the talent and crew involved.  The story is pretty straightforward with a few surprises (and some plot holes), but what elevates this beyond its means are the characters of Oates and Fonda, who play surprisingly well off each other, this being their 3rd film together, the other two being The Hired Hand (1971) and 92 in the Shade (1975).  There is chemistry there, as the two complement each other.  The one thing I didn't understand is if this group was as encompassing and organized as we were led to believe, I didn't understand why they didn't just get the couples during one of their stops for gas or something...it would have been so much easier to take care of business then rather than chasing them down the highway at 60+ miles per hour, but then that would have taken away some of the excitement in removing some of the strongest action sequences.  As far as the female leads, well, they really didn't have much to work with, as Ms. Swit's character was just there more or less to flesh out Oates' character, but Ms. Parker had a bit more (not much), as she was of the more sensitive type, picking up on sinister vibes before the rest of the group.  In terms of direction I thought Starrett did very well, considering he was brought in early in the production as the original director was let go due to the powers that be feeling he up for the job.  The film has a consistently creepy vibe throughout, as the unknown of who may be involved is a persistent factor.  Starrett builds the momentum early, and keeps it going until the end.  There are some scary moments, but I really wouldn't consider this so much a horror film, but more of one to give you the creeps.  One of my favorite scenes is when Frank and Roger are witnessing the ritual and Frank's interested is piqued when the females begin disrobing and the distinct possibility of group intercourse is apparent...which is about the time the girl is killed and the two decide they're in the wrong place at the wrong time and decide to sneak away without drawing attention, only to have Frank's wife Alice unknowingly wake up the entire county with her annoying bray, calling her husband back to the RV...another sequence I really liked was later in the film, as the group is speeding down the road being chased by various vehicles filled with cult members.  They cultists begin jumping on the RV Road Warrior style, and Frank has to fend them off, getting jiggy with a 12-gauge shotgun....woohoo!  One thing I thought odd was during the sacrifice scene the girl to be offered up is stripped nekkid, but her nekkidness is blurred out...we see her behind the fire pit, so one could say perhaps the heat emanating from the fire caused this, but I'd wondering if this was how it was during the original release...it didn't really bother me, but I do prefer the content of films on DVD to be as close to how they were originally released as possible.

The widescreen (1.85:1) picture, enhanced for 16 X 9 TVs, looks really sharp and clean on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release.  The audio is only available in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono, but comes through clearly.  There are some very worthwhile special features including a newly made featurette titled `Hell on Wheels' (17:51) with Peter Fonda relating a lot of interesting information about the film and his co-stars.  Also included is a commentary track with producer Paul Maslansky, actress Lara Parker, moderated by DVD producer Perry Martin, an original theatrical trailer, three radio spots, a poster & still gallery, a behind-the-scenes photo gallery, previews for other Anchor Bay DVD releases like The Entity (1981), Quicksilver Highway (1997), Ghost in the Machine (1993), and a reproduction of an original poster of the film on a card inside the DVD case.

And all the time there really are monsters everywhere you look...the same sort of every day plausible situation anyone could conceivably find themselves in; a Satanic version of Deliverance...another seemingly innocent situation that started out to be a simple canoe ride downriver turned into the nightmare from Hell.

What is so disturbing here is that no matter where they go or how far or how innocent the people they encounter along the way seem, all are against them and the ending is really terrifying and a genuine shocker. You don't get to relax for one single second; it is a fast nightmare ride, with pieces of the RV flying off, the women screaming and the men yelling and all sorts of nasty surprises along the way, culminating in the aforementioned, even more disturbing, climax.

2247568,5,B0007WQGRC,"I consider this movie in my own movie buff history to be among the gems of the ""70's Drive-In Era"".  I remember my father taking me to see this movie for I was the usual young boy into cars and I loved car chases.

However, I didn't bargain for the terror and horror of what spurred those chases.  This movie was excellent in direction and pace. The initial send-off for what got the plot going was excellent, a frightening chase scene complete with night time terror (chasing intruders, spinning tires, frightening music, screaming, the works). The movie slows down a bit during the middle while the main characters (great casting with Peter Fonda, Warren Oates, Loretta Swit, and Susan Parker)try to process what has happened, but this is only a setup for the final phase of the film where the action kicks in and the four race down the roadways for their lives from pursuing cars, motorcycles, tow trucks in a free for all highway melee of chaos.

It was great!

The ending I appreciate more now, although at the time I was like no way, don't do this (I won't give it away myself for those reading here who haven't seen it before).

All in all, a great film gem for a fan of chase action, terror, and the actors involved.

2247569,5,B0007WQGRC,"Jack Starrett is the key here.  One of the most exceptional of B movie directors, and sometimes more-RACE is a most amazing ride.  Originally released by Fox in widescreen-RACE is full of those great tricks of the trade--especially taking a mundane subject like a trailer/camper trip into the realms of the absurd and horrible.  In the manner of method and manner--RACE treds the same territory as HILLS HAVE EYES but with more cinematic flair.  Never available in digital format (nope-no laser disc)--RACE is an amazing addition to the pantheon of horror and witchcraft.  It works beautifully.  One can only ask where is Starrett in our horror universe?  He is so under repped in dvd releases.  Perhaps Anchor Bay will remedy.

In 1983, when movie rentals became big, I rented the movie from a the grocery store.  Grocery store rentals always had the odd-ball type movies for rent.  Remember, ""it's alive""?  To sum it up, this movie always gave me the creeps.  Maybe because in 1989, I was with some friends and we went to Dallas and pulled off into some apartment complexes.  Of course, we were too young to drink.  All of the sudden we heard this god-awful sound or moaning.  It's the kind of sound that gives you the creeps just hearing it.  Of course, it was around Halloween, we looked behind us and there was this house with a big backyard with a fire burning.  Dancing around the fire were some people in black robes dancing with a naked woman.  Anyway, we hauled our butts out of there!  So, you can see why this type of movie could scare the hell out of us!

The scope of this cult is pretty fantastic, considering they seem to be everywhere.  Peter Fonda and Warren Oates are the hubbies, with Lara Parker and Loretta Swit the wives.  Having been a fan of DARK SHADOWS and particularly the beautiful Lara (Angelique), it's good to see Lara in one of her few starring roles in a big screen movie.  Although she does little more than scream and rant and rave, her presence lights up the screen.  The rest of the actors do well, with the always villianous R.G. Armstrong the deadly sheriff.

There are some exciting chase scenes that lead to a rather abrupt ending, and not one you'd expect. Still it's a creepy little road movie, worth it to me for Miss Parker!",1098921600,3,899,4.552795031055901

2247574,4,B0007WQGRC,"The 1975 film ""Race With the Devil"" begins innocently enough. Two couples on vacation in an RV decide to take a turn on a dirt road to spend the night away from the bustle. They park their rocking vehicle out in the wilds of south central Texas. They inspect the beauty of the desolate land, have a candle-lit dinner and a glass of wine, and toast the first night of a needed vacation. The sun sets and a full moon rises. But a funny thing happens.
Across the river they hear an eerie howl and suddenly, a mysterious bonfire roars to life. They grab a pair of binoculars and notice a group of people in black robes dancing around this huge fire. There's weird chanting, a man in a mask with a sword, and nude women at his feet. The dancing becomes more intense, and a woman is stabbed to death in an apparent sacrifice. At that moment, the wife of one of the stunned men turns on the RV light and screams at her husband to come inside. The Satanic cult realizes they are not alone, and furiously charge across the river. Thus begins one long and very creepy chase across the back roads of a Texas landscape.
We've been here before, whether it be with a cannibalistic family in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or Georgia hillbillies in ""Deliverance."" The setup is usually the same - a group of innocents, semi-lost, encountering horrid miscreants without a shred of help anywhere in sight. I don't think ""Race With the Devil"" is as good as either of the two previous films mentioned, but I will say in all honesty this flick scared me as a child.
""Race With the Devil"" taps a primal fear we have of being stranded in unknown lands pursued by people with murderous intentions. The inspirations for this little 1975 horror opus are many, as Satan was quite the villain back in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Where to begin? Perhaps Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby,"" one of the most chilling films ever made. And then you have ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Devil's Rain"" and such TV flicks as ""Crowhaven Farm."" Which brings us to ""Race With the Devil,"" where you have robed Lucifer hippies clawing at an agonizingly slow RV rolling for the nearest stretch of cement. Peter Fonda and Warren Oates do their best to fight off this beer-bellied horde (I suppose with the exception of the occasional dancing, they get little exercise), using everything from vacuum cleaners to ski poles to hold off the possessed crew.
For a kid growing up in the suburbs of Texas (that would be me), Satanic cults existed out there, and they were waiting in the dark. Out there is an uneducated wilderness, and it's scary. To this day, I have moments of fear when camping alone, remembering that cult from ""Race With the Devil."" As our society grows each day into an urban setting with farming communities disappearing, what is rural becomes alien and evil. It's out there man! Who knows what shenanigans they're up to!
The Texas-born Jack Starrett directed this little drive-in horror/action hybrid, and he really didn't create much else. A few episodes of ""Hill Street Blues,"" a couple of other B-movie excursions. He's probably best known as the tough cop with a billy club who drives Sylvester Stallone over the edge in ""First Blood."" He sadly passed on in 1989. Starrett has a funny cameo in Race With the Devil as a nosy gas station attendant.
Warren Oates, the greatest character actor in motion picture history, stars as the unlucky sod who makes the fateful choice to camp in the Texas boonies. He was really too good to be starring in this fare, but he does deliver the best line when the sheriff mentions a local hippie cult that kills cats. With a straight face, Oates replies, ""Well, I guess they ran out of cats."" By most accounts Oates tilted beers with film director Sam Peckinpah while they made such films as ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia."" A huge Warren Oates cult has grown since his death in 1983, and this film is as good as any learn the greatness of this brilliant actor.
In ""Race With the Devil,"" Peter Fonda has a good time shaking martinis while firing shotguns at hillbilly Satanists. And you even have ""Hotlips"" Loretta Swit as a perplexed wife. She likes to scream a lot and wear colorful bathrobes.
I suppose we could obsess over the stupid decisions our protagonists make before Satan closes in on the RV. We could laugh at the dialog as they marvel over the newfangled microwave and color TV. We could even snicker as by the end of ""Race With the Devil,"" the trashed RV resembles Steve Martin's and John Candy's car in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles."" But our laughs are uneasy. When we travel to unknown lands, we are terrified of being preyed upon. In ""Race With the Devil,"" these country folks are out there man, creepy and evil. Part horror, car chase and action, this film is one of the greatest drive-in flicks ever made.",1083628800,12,4856,4.595622119815668
2247575,5,B0007WQGRC,"I saw this film in the 70's. It made a lasting impression on me. The film includes the foxy witch from Dark Shadows. Hotlips from MASH. Peter Fonda from Easy Rider and Mr. Warren Oates.
This film was made in an much inocent time way before the strange societies and strange uneasyness that is circulating now. Talkabout Tom Cruz's film Eyes Wide Shut this film prefigured that message. It just that unlike Cruz's movie that alerted folks that rich people belong to not too frienldly societies so too do regular folk inhabite fringelike clubs too. This classic never got the attention it deserved,perhapes it was too close to real life. The ending is real to life too. I mean with all the innocent children being kidnapped and other freaky things that our cablenews is alerting us to be very wary. Imagine how back in innocent times before Ted Bundy and other kind with strange appetites. How it scary was. I mean Earthday was just invented and peace, love, and joy were still believed in. Heck folks in Florida did noteven lock their doors to their houses yet. This film was way before its time. I pesonnally can not see a vacationing RV without thinking of what happened in the film. People disappear while vacation in cars or RVs more than is realize. The film is not graphic or gory. It does not have to be to get the message across. The panic in the film comes across as pure choas. The choas that one feels in the dark no place to turn and no one to turn to for help. That is what so scary. It so like we are living today with the aftermath of the Twin Towers, never knowing what is gonna happen next. You just want everything to return to normal.
Its like impending doom. This film is exactly what Americans feel like today. We are in that RV and bad things are happening man!",1081382400,8,1782,4.435975609756097

Even though this movie is only rated PG but it is NOT recommended for young children cause it contains violence, language and brief nudity, if you love watching suspense movies or high speed chase movies, then Race With the Devil would be just for you, and it's way better than Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scary Movie cause those movies are more meant for teenagers while this movie is meant for guys.",1046044800,5,641,4.440677966101695
2247578,3,B0007WQGRC,"The whole premise of this suspenseful action flick is flawed  -  if masked murderers were seen from a distance in a remote location, especially if they were exceedingly well organized and included the local constabulary among their number, they would have no need whatsoever to assault the witnesses and would instead more than likely just hightail it outta there  -  but it's great fun, anyway.  Just because Hitchcock would've done a better job with the thing doesn't mean it isn't good.
Friends Warren Oates and Peter Fonda, and their wives, Loretta Swit and Lara Parker, take a mobile home road trip to Colorado for a little skiing.  While camping one night, they chance to witness through binoculars a sacrificial murder across the lake by a bunch of masked Satanists.  (See, why wouldn't the Satanists just flip them off, laugh and run away?  But then we wouldn't have a movie, would we?)  The next thing they know, they're being pursued by the killers.  The local constabulary is no help  -  indeed, they prove to be part of the problem  -  and damn near everyone our hapless misadventurers come across for the rest of their trip happens to be hooked-up, one way or another, with the nasty folk.
Aside from the fundamentally flawed premise, and an ending that really makes no sense at all, this is a great flick.  The road stunts are terrific.  The suspense is masterful, the script pretty good.  The cast are completely believable, throughout.  The movie is handsomely produced, and makes clever underuse of an eerie Leonard Rosenmann score to crank-up the anxiety factor.  It's basically Duel meets Deliverance does Rosemary's Baby a la The Road Warrior, and is pretty much as fun as that mix sounds.
Don't think about it.  Just go along for the ride.",1030579200,7,1760,4.822742474916388
2247579,4,B0007WQGRC,"Right off the bat... suspend your disbelief! If you aren't willing to do that, you are simply not going to get as much enjoyment out of this movie as you deserve to. The premise is suspect, there are holes in the plot, and the actions of the main characters lack sense much of the time. If you are the type of person to get frustrated because the characters forgo the logical path, then this movie is going to irritate you. You'll just be yelling at your television. That's not healthy.
That being said, I love this movie. It's creepy in all the ways that really get to me. It has a town's worth of evil, down-home Texan wiccans. It has paranoia. It has fantastic car chase sequences. It has beautifully sinister locales. It has a motor-home park with demented old folks. It has a battle against rattlesnakes. And it has a brawl in a cowboy bar. It has Peter Fonda, Warren Oates and Lorettta Switt.
It's not gory. I appreciate that. In truth, this movie shouldn't really work with all of its disparate elements. But it does. It builds its tension very slowly, but once it gets going it does not let up. And it has a terrific ending. I wouldn't quite say it's a classic (thus only four stars) but it's damn close. I'd buy it on DVD.",1028851200,3,1231,4.379912663755459
2247580,4,B0007WQGRC,"I loved the car chase films of the 70's.  This capped the list of some of my favorites, which include Vanishing Point, Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry (also with Peter Fonda), and the original Gone in 60 Seconds.  There have been films that do pay homage to the non-CGI spectacles in the 80's, notably The Road Warrior and Raiders of the Lost Ark, both of which boast impressive car chase sequences.  (I think Road Warrior is the superior, best-ever filmed car chase, and seems to have some inspiration from Race With the Devil, given the oversized vehicle pursued by numerous smaller vehicles.  Both films provide incredible action sequences as well as amazing stunt work.)
TV (through schlock like Dukes of Hazzard) and Burt Reynolds effectively killed off the genre (by producing stuff like the awful Cannonball Run films.  Avoid these moronic home movies and rent Gumball Rally instead, which is what Reynolds and his pals ripped off.  I do give him credit for the original Smokey and the Bandit, and double stars for Sally Field looking great in jeans!)
The Genre also survived the Hollywood Moonshine obsession of the 70's, which also provided some great car stunt work.  (Why there was such an obsession with the Moonshine South, I'll never know, but some of Burt Reynolds best work comes from this collection, including WW and the Dixie Dance Kings - 'kay,  not a moonshine movie - and White Lighting.  William Faulkner these films are not, but they are fun to check out.)
Race With the Devil lets its plot unfold patiently.  It'll garner unintended laughs (especially when Warren Oates awes his friends and the audience by showing off the MICROWAVE OVEN contained in the RV), but the movie doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is.  It sets up some great sequences (although Peter Fonda's character needs better aim when handling a shotgun), and does manage to be rather creepy, especially when the two couples stumble upon the awful secret in the hills of Texas.
Favorite Warren Oates Line:  ""It's SUNDAY!!""
This is not The English Patient, and doesn't aspire to be.  The music is dated and pretty awful, but remember that  it's great, B-movie, Drive-In fun.  Treat it as such, hopefully with greasy popcorn, red licorice, and blackberry brandy.  And, don't forget your friends locked in the trunk!",1017360000,2,2311,4.887179487179488
2247581,5,B0007WQGRC,"Warren Oates and Peter Fonda are great in one of those great 1970's movies they just do not make anymore.
Oates and Fonda are the male halves of two couples taking an RV from San Antonio to Aspen.  Along the way, they witness a satanic ritual that quickly ends in a murder.  The rest of the film consists of the two couples trying to make it to Amarillo as the coven pursues them and tries to kill them.
This is such an action packed film, and without CGI effects!  The 1970's were wonderful for big car crash flicks, and this is a good one.  The cast is good, but Jack Starrett's direction keeps both the suspense and the action on equal plains, and he accomplishes it.  The last half hour of the film is an incredible set piece involving the RV, a tow truck, a pickup, and a delivery truck, making many of today's action films pale by comparison.
If you happen upon this somewhere, definitely take it out and have a look.  You will be pleasantly surprised.

2247582,4,B0007WQGRC,"It is not often that I watch, let alone review a movie of this genre but this one in particular left an indelible impression on me as a child.  Like several of the previous reviewers, I first
saw this film at a drive-in in the summer of 1976 with my dad and brother.  It was not uncommon then to see a movie circulating in the drive-in theatres a full year after its release.  The VCR and VHS were still several years away.
Roger (Peter Fonda) and Frank (Warren Oates) are owners of a custom motorcycle business on vacation with their wives to Aspen, Colorado, traveling in a luxurious new RV with all the
amenities imaginable in 1975. (The color TV, the stereo, microwave oven...goahlly!).  On their first night camping out in a remote area, they witness a human sacrifice in the distance as
part of a satanic ritual taking place across the river.  All hell breaks loose when the two are discovered and a vicious pursuit of the foursome ensues escalating into several attacks and car chases. Throughout the film, the motorhome is damaged and falls apart piece by piece as a metaphor for the group's shattered sense of security, diminishing sanity and a dream vacation which has turned into a run for their lives!
The movie's shock value for me was diminished only as a result of my vivid memories of several scenes and due neither to the passage of time nor maturity when I finally saw it for the first time in over two decades. It was still as chilling today as it was when I first saw it a quarter of a century ago!
Don't let the critics' maligning criticism dissuade you from watching this flick.  (Hey, how many of us buy a book because it's on Oprah's list anyway?) Granted, much of the dialog is pedestrian and the characters played by Loretta Swit and Lara Parker seem little more than shallow cutouts of the Stepford Wives.  As for Peter Fonda, the motorcycle riding scenes, reminiscent of his role in Easy Rider, seem gratuitously provided in an attempt capitalize on that movie's popularity. That said, who can forget the sinister smile that appears on the face of Fonda's character just before he runs a satanist's car off a bridge exploding into a fireball?
But the best lines belong to Warren Oates who also appears to play his role with more sincerity.
(""Well, this time they ran out of cats!"")
One curious thing that is never explained, though is why the the gunshop owner goes ahead and sells the two men a 12-gauge rifle if we are led to believe that he too is involved in the conspiracy. (After all, the phone lines are ""down"" at the shop due to a ""big wind""!)

The film's best asset, however, is it's ability to transform seemingly peaceful and innocuous settings into an erie landscape.  Gradually, the audience as well the characters realize you can run but cannot hide as the entire area seems blanketed by a network of satanists conspiring to terrify and ultimately catch the two couples.  Through the skillful hands of the director, this movie affirmatively answers the question as to whether a successful horror film can take place on a rural Texas interstate --- and often in broad daylight!  While that may not seem like a great leap today, back in the mid 70s, Race With the Devil was among the first of its kind. Prior to that, most horror films often revolved around gothic settings such as a haunted house,ghosts or graveyards.
Although this film is not the best execution of an intriguing theme, it's one of the quintessential 70s B movies which helped set a precedent for modern horror.",1005436800,9,3520,4.625

I was surprised at how intense the action is in this somewhat  low-budget effort.

2247589,5,B0007WQGRC,"I first saw this in the summer of 1975. It frightened me so badly that I swore off horror flicks. I saw it again the other day, thinking time and maturity would have softened the scare. No such luck, it scared me just as badly. It is based in the Texas hill country so any fan of other Texas based horror films, such as Texas Chainsaw massacre, will recognize locations and unaccredited supporting cast. Particularly good are the four lead characters....but my personal favorite is the devil himself",948672000,5,499,4.681818181818182
2247590,4,B0007WQGRC,"There's always been something disarming about the presence of Peter Fonda in a picture. Perhaps it's his 'nice guy' presence and you'd be right to assume that his starring in a horror movie would work against it. Not so in  this case. Together with Oates and their stage wives, Fonda's presence is a  good way of making of the terror strike home. The two couples are  all-American high-end middle class types and they love living life to the  fullest extent. And so they make a china shop ready for the horror bull to  enter. The movie isn't as slow-moving as it may seem by the clock, it's  just that there is a great deal of momentum being pent up in the early  portions. When the scares actually do start, they are powerful and  genuinely chilling. Let it be known that Satanist-bashing horror pictures  were fairly common in the first half of the Seventies and here we find a  whole string of Texan communities hard at it. The film is just the right  length and its delivery is augmented tremendously by the dark conclusion.  Despite the content, this film is watchable at all levels. I saw it when I  was 10 years old and found it delightfully chilling. The direction is top  rate and first class performances are extracted from Fonda and Oates. Truly  an overlooked classic from a particularly adventurous era of fright cinema.",944784000,20,1333,4.636752136752137

8053023,5,B0007WQGRC,"I've loved this movie since I first saw it back in the 70's and will watch it again and again.  Number 1 reason I had a crush on Lara Parker from her days on ""Dark Shadows"".  Witches Cults were a big thing back in the 70's, there was rumored to be one of the largest ones in the state out at the lake near my hometown in Central Texas.  Only con I would give this movie is it does make  it appear everyone in the state is a witch.",1521849600,,430,3.797752808988764
