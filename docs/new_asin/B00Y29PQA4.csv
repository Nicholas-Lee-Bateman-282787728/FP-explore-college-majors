7207692,1,B00Y29PQA4,"One star is more than this rip off deserves. A poorly done film with some poor actors in a rip off of a truly great book and film. See the original CBS full length min series ""Salems Lot, but skip this trash, I wish I had never seen it. Other than using the name, this film really has nothing to do with the original story or town and it is about as scary as a Sponge Bob cartoon.",1451952000,,380,3.8846153846153846
7207693,4,B00Y29PQA4,"Deliciously ridiculous. Campy, kooky vampire tale with a town full of senior citizen and small child vampires. Tara Reid makes her major motion picture debut as the lead child vampire. Great idea for a story but small budget, homemade looking effects and poor audio looping really make this look cheap.

7207701,4,B00Y29PQA4,"Great quality for an extremely rare film previously only available in the USA on DVDr in a less-than-stellar presentation (not to mention the endless bootlegs ported from well worn VHS tapes). This factory printed DVD presents ""A Return to Salem's Lot"" in a 16:9 aspect ratio, and thank you very much for that! It's an NTSC All Region import from New Zealand, with sharp, clear picture and sound. I don't imagine we'll ever get anything better for this one. For the definitive genre collection, this is a no-brainer.",1482019200,8,516,4.875

7207703,1,B00Y29PQA4,"WARNING: ""A Return to Salem's Lot"" is a sequel to ""Salem's Lot"" in name only. No characters return. The plot isn't followed up on. No mention is made of anything that happened in the previous movie.

If the name of the town were changed (instead of LOUDLY OVERSTATED), this movie would have nothing to do with ""Salem's Lot"" -- but honestly, that wouldn't have saved it. Even seen as a standalone movie, this sequel-in-name-only is a mediocre piece of work, with hilariously bad acting and strange direction... as well as the awesomest character EVER.

Anthropologist Joe Weber (Michael Moriarty) is called back to the US by his ex-wife, who wants him to spend some time with their dysfunctional adolescent son Jeremy (Ricky Addison Reed). So he takes Jeremy out to Salem's Lot, where he owns a decrepit house. And after a hysterical girl begs for his help, he quickly discovers that the town is populated by vampires (and their human ""drones"").

The vampire leader, Judge Axel (Andrew Duggan), has a special task in mind for Joe: he wants Joe to write the vampire ""Bible"" chronicling their history. At first Joe is reluctantly willing to do this task, but when Jeremy shows signs of being pulled into the vampire fold, he becomes determined to escape. But it's only when an odd old man (Samuel Fuller) comes to town that he has a chance.

The biggest problem with ""A Return To Salem's Lot"" is not that it's a sequel -- it's that it's just a really mediocre vampire movie. Director/producer/writer Larry Cohen just doesn't make it scary or suspenseful, and it's filmed in an ultra-low-budget style that makes it look like Cohen filmed it in his hometown, starring his neighbors.

To be fair, there are a few spooky moments. The early handling of the ""ordinary"" vampires' lives is both funny and unnerving -- little old ladies in floral dresses reapplying their makeup after drinking a screaming girl's blood.

But all that pretty much dies in the second half, which is just a plodding mess. Nowhere else can vampire-slaying be so DULL, and horror staples (vampire children, rubber monsters) become tedious. There are also some pretty horrifying ideas woven into it (the human ""drones"" who are basically malevolent slaves), but doesn't really explore them. And Cohen has some serious issues with continuity -- Joe is established as an amoral jerk who has no problem watching HUMANS murder each other, but he suddenly is just horrified by people being killed by vampires. Yes, because that is SO much worse.

And as mentioned, Joe is an amoral jerk. Did I mention he was an amoral jerk? Because he is. As a result, his hypocritical horror at the vampires feels entirely hollow, especially since he never has a revelatory moment where he realizes what a horrible person he's been. Jeremy is truly his father's son... meaning he's a horrible brat, but at least he seems to be somewhat suggestible rather than just a jerk.

Duggan seems to be doing his best with the genially cruel Judge Axel, and there are moments where you can almost believe he is what he claims to be. Moriarty doesn't seem to know how his role should be played, so he opts for the howling ham. Most of the other actors have the acting ability of wet plywood, particularly Katja Crosby as Joe's vampire lover Cathy. However... there is one redeeming performance in this movie: Samuel Fuller as an elderly, blunt-spoken Nazi-killing veteran who can accept the existence of vampires and head out to slay them without batting an eye. I love this character. I want this guy in every single movie EVER.

Sadly, Fuller's awesomeness is not enough to keep ""A Return to Salem's Lot"" from being a clumsy mess with characters that are despicable at best. Elderly Nazi/vampire slayer is the only reason to watch this.",1481328000,2,3771,4.816074188562596
8717457,5,B00Y29PQA4,I saw this movie as a kid and wanted to see it again. The story was totally different as an adult! Lol still good to watch though,1534464000,,129,3.814814814814815
8717458,5,B00Y29PQA4,Love this movie. Will get the second one also. Arrived in good time. Thank you.,1524441600,,79,4.333333333333333
8717459,1,B00Y29PQA4,Thought it was another movie. Horrible movie,1523836800,,44,5.428571428571429
8717460,3,B00Y29PQA4,"Ive got a soft spot for this movie, in spite of its cheesiness and inconsistent characters. Its an interesting portrayal of a small town filled with traditional, somewhat conservative vampires with a soft spot for their own, in spite of its contradictions and lack of any connection with the first Salems Lot movie or book.

Be warned. If you expected to see Ben Mears and Mark Petrie returning to their former home to be welcomed with open arms (and open fanged mouths) by the surviving (or resurrected) citizens of the original Salems Lot, youll be disappointed. The only things this movie has in common with the first is the name of the town, Jerusalems Lot (or Salems Lot) and vampires. Kurt Barlow had nothing to do with the undead population, theyve been there since the time of the Pilgrims.

The return to Salems Lot refers to Joseph Webbers return to this small town, where he grew up as a boy, raised by his Aunt Clara. Joseph, the main character in the movie, is depicted in the beginning as a ruthless anthropologist, willing to watch other people for the sake of scientific observation. He doesnt keep that attitude for very long. It disappears when he arrives in Salems Lot.

Joe is consistent in his protectiveness of his son, Jeremy, whom he ends up taking with him to the town of his youth. Jeremy, is in a big hurry to grow up when we first meet him, but more than willing to join a group of child vampires once he meets the right (or wrong) girl. Go figure.

Joe also lets his head be turned by the wrong girl, one his aunt sent him away to keep him from, yet actively pushes him towards upon his return. Once more, Im left shaking my head, wondering at the unexplained change. There are many times when the plot feels forced, turning into cheese as a result.

In spite of the cheesiness, this small vampire town in its insular silence and creepiness is compelling. The empty streets during the day, with only a few unfriendly people around, and the sound of vampires whispering from the houses is delightfully chilling in a classic horror fashion. The scenes showing this at the beginning of the film, the mystery of this are among my favorites. They include the vampires calling Joe and Jeremy ours, evoking the mood of the dangerous trees in the Territories of Stephen King and Peter Straubs The Talisman.

Some of the vampire villains are suprisingly sympathetic, even when they're scaring us, an intriguing paradox.

Judge Axel, the stern vampire patriarch was a compelling character. His eagerness to welcome Joseph back to his hometown, his strong sentiment that Joe belonged to Salems Lot before he was born, and his need to have this one human being understand his kind was oddly touching, even while it sent shivers down my spine.

Martha Axel was even more terrifying with her churchlady sweetness, mingled with an enthusiastic bloodlust. She brought a touch of humor to the movie, almost foreshadowing the later works of Joss Whedon in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel.

Amanda Fenton, a little girl vampire who looked like a cross between an old fashioned bisque doll and a young Drew Barrymore was a curious enigma, touching upon profoundly disturbing uncertainty which surrounds a child vampire. Many of the vampire children of Salems Lot posed an odd paradox, sleeping in coffins beneath the school, playing childish games, yet getting married. Its a riddle which is never resolved, adding to the general mystery.

One wonders what might have happened if the story hadnt ended with the predictable conclusion of hunting the vampires down, driving stakes into their hearts, and setting the town on fire.

It was an interesting movie, which made me think. The vampires raised some valid points when trying to persuade Joseph of their right to exist, even when they terrorized and fed on humans. They weren't always consistent in their mainstreaming stance, either. Originally, they claimed only to feed on humans on special occasions. Later, Axel claimed they didn't feed on humans for Josephs sake, as part of their bargain with him in return for writing their history. The fact that they wanted a human to write their history, a human whod been raised in their town was a fascinating point as well.

Overall, Return to Salems Lot was fun to watch. It had some fun and thought-provoking moments, for all the contrived plotting. Balancing general entertainment and raising some interesting ideas versus jarring plot and character inconsistences, I give it three stars.",1514332800,4,4503,4.841352405721716
8717461,1,B00Y29PQA4,"Absolute rubbish! It is stand alone from the original film... there is no ""return,"" no tie in storyline, the only return is of the viewers who watched the first film.

Outside of that.... the stand alone film is filled with inappropriate content, horrible special effects (even for its day) and a ridiculous storyline. ... it's obvious there is nothing similar in the film to the original movie outside of the town.

First movie is excellent. Dont excpect any similarities between the two. There is no horror factor in  return to salems lot, its just hokie pokie foul language in every sentence. Rubbish",1511308800,3,603,4.892156862745098
