We bought this movie at the local supermarket last night and I have never laughed so hard in my life.  The music is pure cheese, the plot is hysterical, the acting is downright scary.  I even checked it out on imdb and all the actors had to be the director's friends, because they have not acted in anything since 1984 when the movie came out.

2120191,4,B0002TVX0K,"I did this review judging that you've already seen the film, I didn't go into the story aspect of the film.

Being a fan of Hard Rock Zombies for a few years now, me and my friends have been awaiting a DVD release of this film. Well now it's here, and here's my review.

My initial reaction while hearing the first key drum beats to the opening track was oh god, it sounds awful. I didn't expect much sound wise after turning over the DVD box and saw AC-3 sound, this normally means in my head the sound isn't going to be great. At the time I had it running though my 5.1 surround sound receiver. After listen to a few minutes of the movie, I decided it would be best just to let my TV speakers handle the audio.

Then after my reaction to the sound it was on to the picture. As well my initial reaction to the sound, the picture quality wasn't a good one either. The opening shoot features a road zipping by into a tunnel, then the title credit, which is red instead of white. It just looks like the film this was taken from wasn't well preserved, a lot of new lines and hairs if you will, were beset on to the picture that didn`t exists on the US VHS version. After watching awhile the image did seem to be sharper then the VHS. No VHS fuzz, but still it's far from perfect. A lot of technical errors, on a few occasions the film would just lock up for a seconds. Then it had a few clipping issues where the 75% of the screen would flash white. Then a few static clips though out the picture.

Now onto my biggest problem with this DVD. Maybe I'm nuts, but I find the music numbers in this movie just awesome. Well every time the band is playing a rockin track then a line of dialog is spoken the music is doubled up then a few seconds afterwards, making a ungodly bunch of echoing in place of the wonderful tracks. I don't know if they've taken the audio from a test version of the film, or if the dialog just simply couldn't be heard so they had to boost the speech and replace background sound. I don't know but it isn't good. I love the music in this film. If anyone reading this has a soundtrack please email me, I'll make it worth your while.

Alright so I pointed out all of the bad points, now I'll point out the good points.  This is great if your a fan. The picture at time does seem to be crisper then the VHS. It's good to own a official release of this film. But here is what makes this DVD worth owning to any Hard Rock Zombies fan. Their are a lot of scenes that were cut out of the original VHS release. Those scenes have been added back in this version. Not like it's a entire different movie, but it is nice to see a few more scenes being a fan of the film.

(...)

Special Features, their are none. They have a cast in crew section that doesn't reveal more then the ending credits do.
In closing the picture isn't great, but it's probably the best your going to find for this title.

Well I guess that does it for my review. (...) 4 out of 5 stars. Considering the likelihood of another DVD being produced I was easy on my star ratings.",1096502400,9,3057,4.115771812080537

2120195,4,B0002TVX0K,"Hard Rock Zombies (Krishna Shah, 1985)

When I was but a wee media critic, there were three films, more than any others, that cemented my love of awful, awful movies. First, there was 1972's Beware! The Blob, directed by Larry Hagman (the recent DVD reissue trumpets it as ""the film J.R. shot!""), one of the few movies I've seen over fifty times in my life. So many bad special effects all piled into one place, with so many quality seventies actors hamming it up. How can you not love it? Then came 1977's Shriek of the Mutilated, which I was lucky enough to catch on late-night TV one night when I was in seventh grade (1981? 82? don't know). I say ""lucky"" because it seems from the DVD that the master print of the film has become horribly degraded, so at least I had a chance to see it in all its original... okay, ""splendor"" is not the right word. It's an awful movie in every sense of the word, but for a movie I didn't see for over twenty years, between that one TV viewing and the release of the DVD, to have left that many indelible images on my mind, there had to have been something transcendent about it.  And then there was Hard Rock Zombies, one of the mainstays of my high school years. I have no idea how many times I rented this from my local video store. All of my friends and I could quote from it at length. It's the kind of bad movie that you know is bad, but you just can't stop watching. I hadn't seen it since those days, but here's another case where a recent DVD release has reaffirmed my love for the awful. In fact, it's even better, in a horrible way, than I remembered it being from back in the day.

The story concerns a band, led by charismatic (and insufferably-coifed) lead singer Jessie (Silent Rage frontman and Chippendales model E. J. Curcio, known these days as E. J. Curse), who are headed for the small town of Grand Guignol for a show. Grand Guignol is not your normal town, however. Serial killers, religious fanatics, evil dwarves, corrupt lawmen, and all other manner of weirdness live there. Aligned against them is one young girl, Cassie (Jennifer Coe, in her only feature film appearance), who finds the band the night before and warns them not to go to the town. Jessie runs into her again once the band gets to town, and the two of them fall in love. When the town turns against the band and murders them, is the power of love enough to bring them back from beyond the grave? Well, okay, no, but a song Jessie wrote from lyrics he found in an ancient book of the dead sure does. The band can get revenge from beyond the grave and still play the concert for the record promoter who's going to be in town!

This movie is full of clich&eacute;s, ""hard rock"" in the vein of John Waite, stupid plot branches that seem like they were last-minute additions (entirely possible; IMDB notes this was originally meant as a twenty-minute short), and really, really awful hair. It's the kind of movie that's so entirely bad that once you've started watching it, you simply can't look away, because you can't bear to not know how much worse this thing's going to get. And it seems to be the difference between your run-of-the-mill awful film and something like Hard Rock Zombies is that this movie never stops getting worse. When the big plot surprise happens about halfway through the movie, you have to wonder how they're going to get even stupider. But oh, my. Trust me on this.

There is a brand of stupidity that is capable of marketing itself as genius. Or there is a brand of genius that expresses itself in ways that are, shall we say, differently abled. One way or the other, though, Hard Rock Zombies is a classic example of the genre. It's funny, it's awful, it's stupid, and it's absolutely must-see. **** ",1251331200,3,3754,4.433333333333334
2120196,4,B0002TVX0K,"If ever there was a film that deserved a holy s**t!  award, this mind-blower would have to be it.  Should you, dear reader, see this?  Hell yeah!  But go into this movie with your eyes open.  People expecting Wes Craven or Sam Raimi will be sorely disappointed once the parade begins to go past of Midget Nazis, a mulleted hair band, a horny Hitler, a horny stammering redneck, a near sexy (and horny) Eva Braun, a werewolf lady, head twitchingly stupid redneck townies (wait until you see the thing they do with the giant faces), not one, but two 80s-era montages, and some kind of magic song that gets this whole snowball rolling.  The acting for the most part is heinous, but for the record, the Hitler character was interesting.  Where this movie loses its star is in the uber-crappy transfer and the equally frustrating sound--though as luck would have it, the lousy music comes across just fine.

My favorite scenes:  the werewolf lady who pulls out two switchblade-looking knives to go after one of the band members.

2120199,3,B0002TVX0K,"Amazing. ""Hard Rock Zombies"" is truly amazing. Before I go to far please note that my 3 star review is for the film, as well as the DVD presentation. Meaning that, as far as awful films go, this would get 5 stars without a doubt. Seriously, this film features:
1. Nazi Midgets
2. Awful Hair Metal Wannabes
3. Octogenarian Sex
4. A love story sub-plot with strong overtones of pedophilia
5. Hideous dialogue
6. Completely inept special effects
I sat in awe for 90 minutes as this film played out. I'm tempted to watch it again this evening just to make sure I didn't miss any of the on screen awfulness. If you are a fan of awful cinema, you must own ""Hard Rock Zombies"".
The DVD release is simply awful. The color is faded, scratchy & jumps around. The sound is muddy, and at times it's impossible to understand the dialogue. In short it's everything Quentin Tarantino tried to do with ""Grindhouse""...but this is the real thing. If you are a fan of the film, this probably won't effect your viewing experience too much.

8031912,1,B0002TVX0K,"Hard Rock Zombies (1984)

 I thought that a couple of reasons to see this movie should be mentioned right off the bat, or maybe three reasons.  The first is the lovely actress Lisa Toothman.  She takes her clothes off a couple of times.  In 1984 we would or could only call her smook'en hot.  In the story she acts as bait to get male critters to act stupid long enough for her and her cannibal gang to kill and eat them.  OK, a hot chick takes her clothes off a couple of times, good.  The town in which the action occurs is a little place called Grand Guignol.  I liked this a lot because of the obscure theatrical reference.  The Grand Guignol theater opened in Paris in an old church in 1897 and continued on until 1962.  It specialized in theatrical performances so vile and grotesque that sometime patrons would pass out or vomit.  Ok, good historical reference, shows the movie guys have some brains, yes?  The third good thing is the existence of the film itself.  The original intent of the film makers was to make a 20 minute short film to insert into the larger film called American Drive-In, also directed by the late Krishna Shah.  Shah took a little more time and made this 90 minute mish mash with the 20 minute clip as it's core.  Amazing, terrible, but amazing.
 The movie itself is wretched in every possible way.  The lighting in some parts is so dark you can't see what's happening.  The sound is uneven with some parts sounding like they were recorded with tin cans and string.  Some of the actors had brief careers in Hollywood but we never saw them either before or since in the tiny films that they made.  The direction also reached the lowest levels.  I don't know if there was an actual script although Shah and David Allen Ball have the credit.  Both of them have the writing credit on American Drive-In also.  Much of the film has the feel of bad improvisation by bad actors.  Only Phil Fondacaro, a pro with 68 credits, is someone that we would have seen in other films.  He is a dwarf and had had roles in many films.  He is wasted here as a blood covered murderous little Nazi.
  That's right, we have Nazi cannibals in this one, including Hitler himself.  We also have Hard Rock Zombies, Zombies who even while dead and even when they can no longer talk can and do play and sing on stage.  Some of the original tunes are passable, just.
  Lots of the screen time is taken up with obvious time filler like recuring shots of Toothman dancing around and a couple of minutes used up in 15 second slices of a dwarf Nazi eating himself to extinction.  The story is worthless.  Technical levels are much too low to be endured.  The acting sucks, the direction sucks.
  I like to take a chance on films with intriguing titles but this one did not pay off.

The production was campy by design. The low budget produced visible microphone shadows and for some reason some of the swastikas were oriented backwards. The music isn't that great, the storyline idiotic, and the cheese lacked flavor.
