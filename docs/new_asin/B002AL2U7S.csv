3885374,5,B002AL2U7S,"I was lucky enough to see this film a couple of months ago at a convention/film festival in San Diego and was really impressed. This is a collection of 5 short horror stories with a wraparound with Trent Haaga(Suburban Nightmare). It also includes Chuck Williams(Bubba Ho-Tep) who i am also a big fan of also! What i liked the most was the fact that all of the stories had their own unique feel, due to the fact that they all had different directors, which is really cool, and you can tell that the filmmakers really cared about the quality of the stories and the film as a whole. It looks to be shot on HD and it really looked great. I give it a 5 based on all of these elements which i find to be rare in the indie horror realm!!",1246233600,9,731,4.154929577464789

This doesn't qualify as horror as there's nothing remotely terrifying about it.  Every vignette is totally predictable and poorly acted.  A mixture of zombies, vampires, werewolves, and a Jason/Freddy wannabe.  It sounds good.  But everything is in the execution.  And this morass should be executed. Of course, if you liked VHS, then you'll probably like this too.  Does anyone today know what horror really is?

The acting is solid, as are the production values. If you liked Creepshow, you'll probably like Slices.",1294272000,2,411,5.0588235294117645
3885462,1,B002AL2U7S,"Sometimes you can tell a lot about an independent film by the studio/distributor that releases it.  In the case of the distributor called Brain Damage Films, one can assume that any movie (and I use that term loosely) is going to be a car wreck.

""Slices"" totes itself as a anthology that is a long the lines of ""Creepshow.""  The only thing Slices has in common with Creepshow is that they are features with short stories.  After that the similarities stop.

Slices is a pathetic attempt at making a movie with a camcorder.  The directors involved here shouldn't even be allowed to make movies.  However, thats the problem with video, it allows talentless hacks an at bat when they shouldn't even be in the game.  If you decide to purchase this movie and are able to watch the entire feature with out fast forwarding it, you win the prize.

Here's are what each segments are about:

""The Exterminator""- This segment is about a man who works for a corporation that puts hits out on those who the company has problems with.  Its a mystery to me how a director can make a torture scene boring but some how the director of this segment happened to achieve this all time low goal.  Typically in Anthologies the first segment would be the second best of the entire movie.  If you can watch this entire short then you will under stand it can only get lower from here.  There is virtually no rhyme or reason to the ending either.

""Dead Letters""- A writer types letters to his passed wife who he thinks comes back to life.  This short has at least a beginning and ending.  What it has in the most basic of story lines it lacks in production value.  There is one section of this short that the wind blowing into the mic is so bad you can't even hear the actors speaking.  Did anyone think to loop this or to do post production audio?

""Night Screams"" -A pathetic attempt at a vampire story.  Horrible acting and a plot that has characters show up with no meaning or understanding.  If a 12 year old were to produce this project for a middle school class he would get a D.  To the grown up who made it...Stick to your day job.

""The Range""-A zombie western sounds like a decent idea right?  Wrong!  This is the worst of the worst.  Acting is even worse than Night Screams.  Story has no point and once again no ending.  In a behind the scenes extra feature there is a shot of the director joking with the cast who aren't on camera while his movie is doing a take 20 yards from him.  I guess having him direct the scene wouldn't of made it any better.  A whole review could just be wrote on the ineptness of this short but i won't waste anyone else's time.

""The Turnout""- Two girls and a guy go hiking only to run into a crazy guy in the woods.  This is the best of the worst.  Music is decent and this short at least has a story that has a beginning and ending.  Pretty sure this short wouldnt do well against most film festival shorts but thats neither here nor there.

""wrap around and ending credits""-The wrap around and in between segments are about a guy who is having problems sleeping who turns on a late night creature feature host who happens to be Trent Haaga.  I have no idea why anyone is high on this Haaga guy.  The guy is not funny, talented, or ever good in any movie I have ever seen him in.  He must work for free.  After the ending credits there is a shower scene with a disgusting nude biker looking chick.  Take my word for it, its a turn off.

If you are ready to waste your time buy this movie.  Don't buy into the film makers fake Amazon reviews saying this movie is good.  If it was good it wouldnt of been distributed by Brain Damage.",1267315200,3,3651,4.298091042584435
3885463,1,B002AL2U7S,"Whoever the previous reviewers are they must have some stake in this film.  It is a no budget disaster.  After watching the first and part of the second sections of the movie (of five), I gave up and threw it in the trash.  About the only reason someone might like it is for the gratuitous violence, and that was poorly done.  The segments I saw were hackneyed, plot-less wonders.  Don't waste your money.

8359679,3,B002AL2U7S,"Slices begins with a song that sounds like Motorhead or the riff from ""Train Kept a Rollin"" the Aerosmith/Yardbirds tune.  A man wakes up and watches a horror movie.  The man on TV mentions five horror stories guaranteed to give us chills.  The first story takes place in the not too distant future.  We read a message as story one begins that says in order for the United States to keep the population around 300 million the government has developed a secret organization known as the Q that dispatches a secret task force to specially trained men to eradicate any individual deemed by the state as disposable.  They men are known as Exterminators.

Story one is called the Exterminator.

We see a boss walk into the office of his younger employee.  He's angry because he has to come down to visit this inexperienced man.  The boss asks if his mom dresses him.  He says ""We here at the Q help keep the population under control"".  The younger guy think 300 million is too much and the boss says ""I didn't ask for you opinion!""  He says the young guy reminds him of a puppet and adds ""You have one job and that's to get the list"".  The younger guy says he doesn't have the list.  Usually it's given to him every morning by 9 am.  The boss screams ""Where is the list!"" but the younger guy says ""When it arrives you'll be the first to know about it"".

The boss says every day he gets out of bed and wonders what he's doing.  He says he looks down from his high office room and sees people who resemble ants driving to work, coming home to their family, turn on the news and hear Homeland Security is going to build more walls and protect their freedom.  He doesn't understand why he's doing this job anymore.  The younger guy says ""To maintain order sir"".  The boss says when he started this Q job he was just like him and demands he have the list presented to him by Monday morning.  The young guy says he'll have it by this evening.

The boss goes home and gets a shower.  Later that night he wakes up and a man attacks him when he sees flashing lights.  He's now tied to a chair with a bag over his head after the robber says ""And a Merry Christmas to you sir!""  The boss screams for help.  The man walks in and punches him out.  He pulls the bag off the boss's head, grabs his hair and punches him around before shaving off his hair.  Later he throws fluid at his mouth.  The robber leaves and comes back later.  He says ""Hello sir.  It's just you and me"".  I have a couple activities planned for you today so I hope you enjoy them!""  Do what I say and you'll be just fine"".  The boss screams ""Who are you!"" so the guy takes his mask off and twists the boss's nipples as he proceeds to wrap a cloth around his mouth.  The man zaps the boss's nipples with something and throws a cup of blood in his eyes.  The boss begs the crazy guy not to drive a nail through his hands but he does it anyway.

The boss wakes up asking to be let go so he can go home.  The crazy robber guy just walks away.  He returns and says he's not looking so good.  The robber gets upset when the boss throws up on his shoes.  The boss says ""It really hurts man!"" and laughs.  The boss says ""You're supposed to be killing the homeless and poor- not people like me!  I'm the man of the Q!""  The robber says he has no idea what he's been through.  When he's killing women and their children walk in.  The look on their faces.  And he has to come in here and deal with people like the boss who throw up on his shoes.  ""You're not the boss of anyone and have been terminated!""  The boss reveals his final words to the Q and those are... he spits on the robber's face.  The guy says ""When you get to hell save me a seat!"" and suffocates the boss's head with a bag.

The moral of this story- never treat people like crap because it might come back to haunt you.  I was surprised the killer wasn't the young employee he humiliated earlier.  Really surprised.

Story 2.  Dead Letters.  A man visits a grave site.  He's a book writer.  His friend/adviser Tyler says it's been 2 years and asks if he's still drinking.  Tyler says he'll take care of the book writer and his career.  He hasn't written anything in 2 years and his fans haven't forgotten about him.  Tyler says he'll get him a ghost writer if he needs it.  The book writer says he's also his friend when asked what his intentions are.  Tyler hands the book writer fan letters and a package.  In his car the book writer sarcastically says ""Yeah, I remember what friends are for"".

The book writer pulls over and has a drink.  He opens the package at home.  He opens it and it's a typewriter in a suitcase.  He takes the typewriter to his small room upstairs and begins to type a story.  We now see claymation of a man having a beer in a bar and watching a woman perform a song on stage.  Now THAT was weird!  The book writer's adviser Tyler calls and says he made him an offer he can't refuse involving a 5-book deal.  The book writer invites Tyler over for dinner.

The book writer has a flashback of himself talking to a woman who says she doesn't belong here.  She wonders what she had here, but he says ""A marriage based on love"".  The book writer says she brought him life years ago and now he will bring her life.  He says he's been given a gift to right what ended so early- that being this woman's life.  He says he can be a loving devoted spouse.  The book writer adds she's like clay and he can shape her in any way he desires.  We now see another claymation of the book writer guy typing frantically on his typewriter as his claymation wife falls in half, lol.  Wait, this woman is the book writers daughter?  At least by that daddy comment she is!  The story comes across like she's more than a daughter if you know what I'm saying.

Tyler the adviser shows up to the book writer's house.  They toast to a new life.  Tyler says things didn't go as smoothy as he thought and the book deal fell through.  The book writer is confused.  Why?  They felt he wasn't as committed.  The book writer says he believes in everything he writes regardless what anyone else thinks.  The book writer says his life is complete anyway.  He invites Tyler in the dining room and... his daughter or wife is alive again.  Tyler freaks out!  The book writer says ""What's wrong, it looks like you've seen a ghost?""  They try to eat dinner but Tyler, he ain't hungry.

The book writer says he's thinking about a honeymoon to renew his vows.  Suddenly his wife is a skeleton!  She's not lively anymore.  The book writer says ""What should I do in my situation?"" Tyler says ""I recommend seeing a doctor since, you know, there's a dead skeleton body of your wife sitting in a chair and having dinner with you!""  He doesn't say it quite like that, hehe.  The two have a meeting at a swimming pool.  The book writer says ""Fake worlds with fictional characters and contrived dilemmas"".  The book writer says if there's anything he wants back it's his wife.  When Tyler says ""Ethel is dead!"" (his wife) the book writer punches him right in the mouth!

Story 3.  Night Scream.  The narrator says his life has been molded by a series of bad decisions.  He describes it.  He meets a bunch of people at a log cabin.  Wendy is the sexy neurotic blonde and would offer a distraction.  That was the plan.  Davis was with Wendy, a pain in the rear, more than a little senseless but figures he wouldn't have to deal with him that much.  Stacy is a wonderful girl he met a few days ago.  A good girl who you'd bring to family functions if you wanted to be normal.  His father believes that looking after family is important since blood is thicker than water, but the narrator disagrees.  Some costs are too high.  All he wanted was answers as to why he was on a mission for 2 years of his life and when it will end.  He mentions going to sleep after a party is when things got worse.

He wakes up at night hearing an odd sound and wonders what it is.  His friend chugs along.  He sees a woman up ahead in the hallway who says ""Help me"".  Her name's Sandra.  She just appears there.  She has some scratches but nobody knows what's wrong.  The guy who the narrator said makes little sense (Davis)... yeah, he doesn't.  Anyway Sandra screams ""Dead!"" for no reason before the characters introduce themselves.  Davis the dense guy says he can drive her into town tomorrow.  He offers to take her to the bedroom and his girlfriend gets upset.  ""I think you can manage that one by yourself!""  That line doesn't make sense really.  Does she want her boyfriend to carry this girl to the bedroom?

The dense guy says ""Man did you see the butt on that chick?"" in reference to Sandra.  His friend says ""Some strange girl comes into our house, says we're all going to die and all you can think about is her butt?""  He says ""I like her breasts too!""  He doesn't use such nice words though.  The dense guy goes outside to smoke and hears a loud sound.  He thinks it's his girlfriend Wendy so he goes into the darkness to find her.  A woman shows up but according to his facial expression, it sure ain't Wendy!  She grabs the guy and puts puncture wounds on his skin.  Inside the young people wonder who Sandra is.  The girlfriend thinks she broke out of prison.

The girls see a dead body in the woods... I guess.  We don't see it.  A woman's about to take medication when a boy appears behind her.  Her eyes get big and the screen fades to black and white.  A woman says to her boyfriend ""Kill her Joey!"" and falls to the floor with a hole in her neck.  Stacy says ""I'm saving the best for last"" and ""I'm surprised you fell for my damsel in distress call"".  The man she's having a conversation with drops a big announcement.  He's been tracking her for months.  A man walks through the door and shoots Stacy.  He's the father of the man having a conversation with Stacy.  Stacy flashes her vampire fangs and gets shot again in the forehead.  The man says ""I'm here for you Stacy.  I'm your brother"".  Stacy says ""You should've listened to daddy!"" and bites his neck.  The father shoots the girl again.  Afterwards the father says to the son they have to dig his sister a grave.  The narrator says ""Yeah I got my answers but sometimes it's better not to ask any questions or you'll have to live with the truth for the rest of your life"".  I didn't get my answer.  What the heck happened?

The next story takes place in the old moldy west according to the narrator.  It's called the Range.  Two men (one a colonel, the other a clueless silly person) are walking in the desert when they see a Native American.  The clueless guy asks the Native American where his horse's engine is.  He accidentally shoots the Native American.  His friend, the colonel, says ""You have the intellect of a drunken mouse"".  The colonel's wife appears out of nowhere in the desert.  She says ""I can't believe we came all the way from New York just to get attacked by savages, no food or water, or decent service"".

She says ""This isn't the trip I had in mind!""  Not sure how the wife arrived to the desert suddenly but yeah!  The colonel and his wife camp out in the desert with several other men.  One of the guys says that the colonel needs to be more of a gentleman instead of insulting his men.  One man says ""What I wouldn't do for a woman and a bath"".  They play a guitar line that sounds like Jefferson Airplane's ""Volunteers"".  Some man says to his wife that he's going to strike it rich so it'll be easy livin' for now on.  She talks about wanting children.  Suddenly in another location nearby a man hears loud screeching and freaks out.  The colonel and his men go to find out what it is.  They hear growling as they approach with their lanterns.  Yes it's dark.  Too dark to see.  A man in a flannel shirt became a zombie and eats something.  The colonel and his men see smoke and decide what to do.  The wife is happy to see her husband, but he's a zombie so he walks up to her in a limpy slow way which frightens her.  She runs away.

The woman finds the colonel and says he's just over the hill.  She explains when her husband returned he looked different and is sick.  She will give the colonel money if he and his men help her.  She gets offended when the colonel suggests they were savages over the hills.  When they get there they see blood all over the ground.  They hear growling, walk around and see the wife's zombie husband up in the rocks.  They shoot at him but it doesn't have any effect.  Another zombie takes away some of the colonel's clueless men.

The colonel says his group needs to pull themselves together because for one thing there's no way he can take care of these zombies alone and secondly to warn the townspeople.  The wife slaps the perverted clueless guy and he says ""Thank you, thank you kindly"" lol.  Meanwhile the zombies are walking over the hills and heading towards the colonel and his men.  They shoot at the zombies.  A vampire is seen howling on a rock and... I guess the story's done now.  The zombies won I guess.

Story 5.  Turn Out.

The narrator says Diane and himself were a match for each other and knew she'd be his wife eventually.  He just needed the right time and place to do it.  They say love is the ultimate bond two people can share but if love is such a beautiful thing how can it create a monster?  We see three young people hiking in the woods.  The one girl recommends hanging out by the stream to have lunch since it's safe.  A man and woman kiss by the river.  When the man says he has to pee she gets upset and says to get off of her.  Come on, peeing only takes a minute.  I'm sure she can wait that long!  The nerve of some impatient people.

She tells her friend the situation and the friend says she'll go look for the girl's boyfriend since he hasn't returned in... a minute.  While standing there peeing an old man from behind pulls him to the ground.  The girl is taken away by the old man as well, so the girlfriend panics as she runs through the woods to look for them.  The man ties them both together around a tree and stares and them with an ax in hand.  He pets the girl because she's pretty.  That's what you're supposed to do with tied up girls who are pretty- pet them.

The old man asks them if they believe in love and trust.  They nod their head yes.  He then asks ""Do you really think I care?""  I think you care, otherwise you wouldn't have asked!  Anyway the old man says ""Are you willing to give up your life for hers?""  He asks the girl ""Do you really believe he loves you that much?"" because apparently he doesn't.  He then chops at the boyfriend's body.  Wait, I thought the woman tied up was the friend of this man's girlfriend?  It would be funny on the old man's part if it was the friend.  Who knows.

The other girl yells for them.  ""Jack!  Diane!"" and then John Mellencamp appears and says ""Life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone""  Nah, instead the old man rolls the woman around and chops up her body with an ax.  Blood flies everywhere.  At least he has the decency to separate her from Jack before slicing her up.  And wow does he slice.  He then sees the girl.  The first few notes of Fine Young Cannibals ""She Drives Me Crazy"" plays and off she runs.  She runs up to her chopped up friend's dead body and when she turns around the old man is ready to swing that ax, but she's able to strangle him to the ground.  She goes crazy and strangles him but he's able to strangle her at the same time.  Two stranglers, only one survivor!

Hey, she wins!  She's lucky he's an old man now.  10 years prior the outcome would've been different.  She picks up that ax.  Is she... going to do what I think she is?  Chop up the old man with it?  No, she's going to walk away.  The girl says ""Sometimes you just don't know how your life is going to turn out"".

The narrator on TV tells one more story.  It's about a man who can't sleep and thinks the images he sees on TV are fake, but what he doesn't realize is that the terror is coming to his window.  For when a man can't sleep, when does the dream begin and the reality end!  The man sneaks around the refrigerator but a slasher with a knife slices at him.  He falls on the kitchen floor.  He screams for help but nobody can do that I'm afraid.

Slices is sort of lame.  The first two stories are pretty good, especially the first one.  Watching a man being tortured after verbally abusing others is fun to watch.  The second story feels incomplete in a way, since the book writer should've had more of his mental illness revealed with a longer story.  The vampire story is absolutely lame though.  It tries to tell too much and most of it takes place in the dark so we can't see anything.  Being short really hurt this story and made me confused trying to figure out who the characters are.  The cowboy one was lame because too much was devoted to the colonel and his crew of misfits playing music and saying dumb things without a proper ending.  The zombie outbreak is too short at only a few minutes.  The fifth story is very good, but didn't have a proper ending and wasn't much of a story to be honest- I just liked to watch the crazy old man slice that girl up.  For what it is though, to question if two people really love each other and how far they'd be willing to go to save the other, it was pretty good.

The stories are too short to make an impression so overall a 3-star rating is about right.  I probably wouldn't recommend this.",1502064000,,17467,4.24641659042391
