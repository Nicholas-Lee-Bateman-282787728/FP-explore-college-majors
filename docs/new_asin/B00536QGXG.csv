4533817,4,B00536QGXG,Just an entertaining old movie. No academy award stuff but fun.  I remembered it from when I was a kid.  MC,1357084800,,107,4.0476190476190474
4533818,4,B00536QGXG,"About what I expected as far as a ""B"" movie that I had heard about. Good to have in my ""watch occasionally"" library, alongside my primary library.",1353283200,,146,4.444444444444445
4533819,4,B00536QGXG,"The plot of this little movie is pretty silly, and the characterizations of the Arabs is typically goofy for this period in movies.

But the cast is very good, the production qualities are fine for a B-movie, there are few really huge plot holes or outright technical impossibilities. (I thought German tanks ran on diesel fuel!) The plot has a nice mix of action and a little mystery.

If you take this movie for what it is you will enjoy it. In fact it is sufficiently fun that I'm keeping my copy on the shelf with the other DVD's that are keepers.",1350518400,7,551,4.392156862745098
4533820,3,B00536QGXG,"This movie is typical of the male interest fiction of post WW2, so it is a product of it's time in it's views and attitudes.  Most of the American oil exploration crew doesn't realize the gems stolen by the German tank crew are still aboard, but the leader is quite prepared to give them back to the original owner in exchange for oil rights under that khalifa's part of the desert, even though that Bedouin leader gained his wealth from the slave trade.  In other words, characters are making practical amoral decisions, so it's hard to root for anyone. Irritatingly, they throw in a quote from Abe Lincoln to redeem their greedy companion that gives his life in the end, even though he created their precarious position in the first place.

Flight Of The Phoenix is a better bet for general audiences with a similar theme of desert survival.

The tank used appears to be a modified M24 Chaffee, and I'm sure this was shot in the American Southwest.",1338163200,,950,4.603550295857988
4533821,5,B00536QGXG,This is a very well done adventure/mystery that is probably missed by a lot of people! Rod Taylor and Tab Hunter do an exceptional job of acting and the plot is very interesting! Getting the old German tank running again to save their lives is a hoot! It's a picture well worth watching!,1335052800,5,287,4.433962264150943
4533822,5,B00536QGXG,"The Steel Lady is a good movie about survival in the Arabian desert.  Although it is not a war movie it has the action and military equipment found in one.  Four part owners of a small oil company are exploring for oil in the years after the end of WW2.  Their plane is caught in a severe desert sand storm and they must crash land.

They discover a flag on a German tank protruding out of a sand dune.  They dig the tank out and fix it to use for their escape from the desert.  One of the crew finds a treasure of jewels the Nazis stole from the Arabs, hidden inside the tank and he plots to keep it for himself.

Arabs attack the tank to retrieve the jewels while the other crew members do not understand why.  There is a lot of action in the running battle.  The story line unfolds nicely with the severity of life in the dessert intensifies the struggle.

Morality prevails in the end.  All the bad guys get their just due.  The bad guy on our side repents sacrificing himself to save the others.",1326758400,12,1000,4.178010471204188
4533823,5,B00536QGXG,It's been years since I last saw this film. Has never been available till now. Really enjoyed seeing it again.,1317772800,2,110,4.55
4533824,5,B00536QGXG,"I saw the beginning of this movie when I was about 10 years old. It came out late on a weekend and I could not keep awake to finish watching it. I couldn't remember the name of the movie, just that Tab Hunter was one of the characters in this movie. Originally I thought that Hunter was a member of the Foreign Legion, but it turns out he was a member of a crew searching for oil in the Sahara Dessert. Rod Cameron was the pilot of the airplane and leader of the expedition. I remember Cameron's baritone voice, which kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. Forty or fifty years later I finally found the movie and was able to unlock that mystery. I guess that should say something about how good of a movie it is.  Just by chance I looked up movies by Tab Hunter and I found out the title of the movie as the ""Steel Lady."" I tried to find this movie and you were the only place I could locate it. I like movies with any type of treasure and such. I specifically remember that one of the men had found a bag of jewels somewhere in a German Tank, and that caught my interest so I wanted to find this movie to find out what happened to them and the jewels. It's a great movie and it kept my interest through out, until the very end. I would recommend this movie to any one who is looking for adventure of likes movies with treasure and the unknown, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.",1430092800,2,1402,4.061371841155235
4533825,5,B00536QGXG,I saw this movie as a kid and was always impressed with it's premise. Was happy to see it on DVD and bought it. Watched it many times. They converted an American tank to look like a Panzer III . It looked good. The story line was different and believable.,1425340800,2,255,4.12

4533831,5,B00536QGXG,Just a great old b/w movie story.  Would be a great remake.  You could make a Panzer Mark III with computer graphics.,1400544000,,117,4.2727272727272725
4533832,2,B00536QGXG,"I saw this movie many years ago and eventually tracked it down. regrettably it has not stood the test of time and I now know how much better the movies are today in comparison. Tab Hunter was also in the movie. Especially the special effects. It would be good to see this movie redone. Anyhow I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it to those interested in a  good adventure movie. Steve McGregor, St Ives, Australia",1398729600,,415,4.533333333333333
4533833,2,B00536QGXG,I remembered this movie from childhood and ordered it when I found it on Amazon.  A fun movie full of Hollywood sterotypes and low budget sets.  The sound however is bad and non speech sounds are very muddy and reverberate annoyingly.,1369353600,,234,4.682926829268292

8455019,3,B00536QGXG,"I saw this movie a LONG time ago and never forgot it. Just wanted to add it to my collection. It was worth watching back then, I suppose it is just passable by today's standards, but I will enjoy it.",1483920000,,199,4.0
8455020,2,B00536QGXG,The overly loud soundtrack drowned out much of the dialogue and there were no closed captions to make up for that.,1474329600,,114,4.476190476190476

8455023,4,B00536QGXG,Story lines were simple World War II story. Tab Hunter had more leading role than other young stars in the by gone day including Clint Eastwood and David Janssen.,1456531200,,162,4.620689655172414
8455024,1,B00536QGXG,"Excellent classic. Considering that this was made almost 63 years ago, you would never be able to tell this was a low budget movie.

The acting was outstanding, the frequently stress-induced, acerbic interactions among the leading, stranded, protagonist victims realistic. How did we come to that assessment? Simply put, we couldn't tell that these guys were acting! Exactly how human nature responds under extremely stressful, life threatening situations.

If you're looking for an outstanding action movie, sans all the new genre of special effects, CGI, etc, etc. watch ""The Steel Lady.""",1455148800,,590,5.472527472527473
