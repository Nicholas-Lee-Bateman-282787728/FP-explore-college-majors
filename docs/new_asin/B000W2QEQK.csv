8221081,5,B000W2QEQK,"I have lessoned  with the author and very much appreciated this form of Chi Lel.  I practiced it daily for a few years.  i have not for some time, but NOW when I have trouble falling to sleep I imagine myself doing this form lying in bed.  Within 10 seconds I find myself yawning deeply and so far have fallen asleep BEFORE I got all the way through the form.  It takes some practice to make it your own in your movement pattern sub conscious.  Once you do, it is very relaxing and you actually feel a significant increase in very peaceful energy.,",1446940800,4,548,4.271844660194175
8221082,5,B000W2QEQK,"First i tried Lee Holden's qigong.  It was ok, but seemed to lack something.  I learned about ChiLel qigong from someone online who went over to China and actually studied with Master Chan.  I've only learned Lift Chi Up, Pour Chi Down so far and it is amazing!  All due respect to Mr Holden, if you want to learn qigong,  learn from Chinese masters for best results I think.",1444176000,4,375,4.3768115942028984
