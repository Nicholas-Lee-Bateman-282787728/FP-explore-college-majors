6667014,5,B00NLHEA7I,Great as usual.,1420243200,,15,4.333333333333333
6667015,2,B00NLHEA7I,"The 2 stars are for the fact that Ashley Turner is such a great instructor.  She does more than just direct your yoga practice, she reminds you to become a part of your yoga; to breathe, pause, listen to your body, heighten your awareness, relax, be flexible, be strong, bend and allow yourself to relax into the poses, and to let go of everyday stuff to focus on your practice.  For this reason alone, it is getting 2 stars.

As for the production and actual asans, this DVD is not a good choice and would rate 0 stars.  First, the segments are in actuality only 9-10 minutes of yoga poses after all the talking, warm up, and shavasana so it is a really small amount of time spent on your practice.  You would have to do the whole DVD to get any benefit and with all of the pausing in between the segments, it prevents any type of flow to your practice and would be annoying.  As a yoga practitioner for over 25 years, I would not recommend this short a time even to beginners.  Anything less than 30 minutes is not worth it and you won't derive any real long lasting benefit.  Second, she forgets to do poses on both sides in several of the 5 elements.  This is just bad editing,production, and teaching.  I can only assume after doing several takes she simply forgot where she was and what she was doing.  Not good!!!  Very annoying!!  Bad yoga!!!

That being said, I would recommend all of Ashley Turner's other yoga DVD's as I own and love them all (which is why I was excited about this one!) and find her to be a fantastic and inspiring yoga teacher.  Her other DVD's are segmented into 2 elements such a Strength & Flexibility and I recommend doing both elements or the full DVD as they really balance out one another and provide the most benefit to you and your practice.

As for this DVD, steer clear of this one----I would not recommend to anyone!",1420070400,89,1858,4.357558139534884
6667016,5,B00NLHEA7I,"I did this dvd for the first time today and loved it.  I have all of Ashley Turner's Element dvd's and she has quickly become my favorite yoga instructor.  Her instructions are clear and based on years of experience and expertise.  I was so happy to have a new one to add to my collection!  This dvd is unique in that you can do a single 15 minute routine or mix and match them however you want that day.  Plus she includes a short warm-up and cool-down that automatically plays with your selections.  I would say that this dvd isn't for those brand new to yoga but more of an intermediate level.  I love the options and flexibility of this one, great for days that are short on time or when you want a longer practice.",1417910400,16,719,4.242647058823529
6667017,5,B00NLHEA7I,"I love Element videos and have almost all of them.  I have all by Ashley Turner.  She never disappoints with new moves or a new twist on traditional moves.  I think this DVD is Element's attempt at beating Giaim's series of videos with  20-25 minute yoga segments. This DVD also has 5 segments, each with its own purpose: for example, Energy and Flexability.  What this DVD has over Giaim's is programmability, a warm up and a cool down for each segment.  By programmability  I mean you can combine any segments or even double the same segment and it adds the warm up and cool down automatically.  Even though every segment has a part that helps the entire body, I like that each segment targets a different area of the body so that as you go from first to last segment you work your way up your body. One thing to note when doing Ashley Turner DVDs is that some times she does a lot on one side before switching to the other. I think she is trying to exhaust the muscles on one side before switching to the other. I highly recommend this DVD. When I did all 5 in one day, I was sore the next day and that doesn't usually happen to me for yoga videos!",1417651200,26,1151,4.247706422018348
6667018,5,B00NLHEA7I,"Love this video, much varied movement which flows and is not static.  Goes along with newer theories about the ""nourishment of movement"" and that all body areas need movement and flow!

6667026,5,B00NLHEA7I,"Just wonderful!  Love it, love it, love it!  This dvd has the functionality to allow you to pick a single, or any combination of the 5 different 20 minute workouts.  It took me a bit to get a handle on how this worked, but it's really easy.  Once you pick what you want for the day and start it up, the dvd automatically adds a warm up and Savasana (cool down) to your selected routine.  I think that the poses are explained well and really enjoy the instructor.",1454457600,2,462,4.204545454545454

6667029,1,B00NLHEA7I,"Since there are already lots of reviews of the content of this DVD, my 2 cents is regarding which format to purchase ... Amazon Video streaming or DVD.  I purchased the Amazon Video version because I travel frequently and wanted the option to do the workouts in situations where a DVD player was not available (like in a hotel room).  In hindsight, I should have purchased the DVD version instead.  First, the Amazon Video streaming version cost $2 more than the physical DVD version.  Second, the Amazon Video streaming version is one long video stream that begins with the introduction, then goes from one day to the next with no break and no way to select the individual days.  There is no way to find an individual Day workout beyond fast forwarding or reversing and watching for the fade between Days.  Since most of the time I will have access to a DVD player, I wish I'd purchased the DVD version instead.  I like the content of the program, but I find the Amazon Video streaming version less than desirable.  I am giving this title 1 Star hoping that I help future potential buyers avoid my mistake  and chose the DVD version instead.  Hope this helps!",1452384000,7,1160,4.587378640776699
6667030,2,B00NLHEA7I,I think it's great that there are 5 different yoga sequences included in this production.  I just wish there were a mechanism through which I could choose one over the other without having to fast-forward and rewind constantly.,1451433600,,227,4.973684210526316

I honestly borrowed it, off & on for a year but after getting fined for accidentally forgetting to return it, I decided to buy it since my husband is the one who started using it and complaining of soreness, in the best muscle toning way. My husband is 6'6, 200lbs and a man's man. I knew then it was worth the purchase.

6667039,5,B00NLHEA7I,"As I do not have the opportunity to take Ashley's live classes, this DVD brought me back a bit of her teaching magic.
A great combination of smaller classes that can be put together in many different ways.

The practice begins with breath, continues to the workout you chose and ends in relaxation.  This is as close to having your own personal yoga instructor in your home as possible.  Several friends and I use this video and love it.  I have bought many, many yoga videos but this is by far my favorite.",1438214400,2,445,4.5
6667042,5,B00NLHEA7I,"While I agree with the 2 and 3 star reviews that the video segments are short, and there is a lot of work on one side of the body before switching sides, I absolutely love this video and find that queuing up 2 to 3 segments at a time gives me a good workout.  The programmability is a huge plus, as many have mentioned, and Ms. Turner's focus on the core of yoga as a mindfulness practice is wonderful.  I use this video every day or every other day, and I always feel centered and content with myself after.  I highly recommend this yoga practice!",1436832000,4,548,4.2
6667043,3,B00NLHEA7I,"I like Ashley Turner DVD's normally.  However, I do not like this DVD as much. I feel for the short amount of time each of the clips are (about 20 minutes), there should be more poses instead of focusing on holding one pose.",1435708800,,224,4.209302325581396

6667047,5,B00NLHEA7I,"I'm a big fan of Ashley's yoga teachings because she always ""says"" things during the practice to make me think and to make me push harder. So I was really excited to order her newest and it is awesome! I really like the fact I can customize my practice by combining more than one 15 min segment (each one very specific like core or flexibility or stress relief) and the DVD automatically cues up a warm up and cool down with it. The 15 min segments are also perfect for when I don't have time for 30-45 min practice. The only warning I'll include is this is really not geared towards beginners like some of her other Element yoga DVD's. The poses are more challenging and she moves through them quickly so I'd say its better suited to those who have familiarity with poses maybe looking for the next level.",1431734400,2,806,4.38

6667050,4,B00NLHEA7I,"I really enjoy this DVD.  The first segment is quite challenging, so I usually do the 2nd segment first to warm up and then come back to the the 1st segment.  I think Ashley Turner does a great job queuing for the moves.",1429747200,,220,4.093023255813954

6667052,5,B00NLHEA7I,"This is my new favorite yoga practice and I have many yoga dvds. I love the 15 minute format, which is actually longer if you add in the warm-up). It is so easy to add this length of practice onto any cardio or toning workout, or squeeze it in when you're in a hurry. Even though they are short, they feel complete and totally worthwhile and not rushed or incomplete. Ashley's practices on this dvd are really unique! She offers a unique twist on traditional poses and even some you don't see very often. I will use this often and I truly hope she, or other instructors, come out with more like this format.",1428883200,,607,4.333333333333333

I just wish that each workout included a shorter cool down.  If you do a single workout, it automatically adds the warmup and cool down and the total running time is more like 25-28 minutes rather than the 15 advertised!",1427241600,,338,4.775862068965517
6667057,5,B00NLHEA7I,Absolutly LOVE her cd's. Highly recommend!! This cd's has short yoga sessions that you can do 1 by itself if your pressed for time or combine as many sessions as you like. Great for all levels!!,1427155200,,194,4.416666666666667

6667059,5,B00NLHEA7I,An amazing yoga video.  Ashley is gorgeous and so is her video.  Each day she works on different muscles using different poses.  She pays special attention to the soas muscle which is so valuable.  I have many videos and this is the first one in which the instructor actually has poses the concentrates on that all important muscle.  I highly recommend it.,1425945600,,356,4.67741935483871

8678839,5,B00NLHEA7I,"I have a number of yoga DVDs, but I find myself turning to this one more than the others.  The main reason is the flexibility to build whatever sort of yoga program I'm up for, or have time for, on that particular day.  I can do all of the segments, or if I just have 15 minutes, just one of them.  Or I can cycle through them for variety.  I like Ashley's voice and direction.  My skill level is probably around intermediate (although some days it feels like beginner level), and I have little trouble doing the poses or following along.  If there is something I really can't do, I adjust as needed, but that's pretty rare.  I am surprised by how much I enjoy this DVD, and am glad I picked it up.

8678842,4,B00NLHEA7I,"Ashley Turner is amazing. 5 stars for her teaching, tone, pace and practice. Her style is my favorite.
This is a great set of mini sessions to use if you only have 30 mins.
HOWEVER, the 4 stars is because way it was produced/digitally packaged doesn't facilitate that. I own this on Amazon video so that I can practice (with Ashley Turner) when I travel for work. I love the ease of logging in on my laptop and finding my favorite instructor in my video library. I do wish they session had labels underneath so I could quickly fast forward to the one I planned to do.
I actually noted the intro time to each session (along with color she is wearing). I keep a little card with my computer so I can find the quick session QUICKLY. I wish they had incorporated that into this production. I wonder if the DVD has it? Anyway, hopefully this helps someone else. Namaste.

8678847,3,B00NLHEA7I,"I have tried and liked some of instructor Ashley Turner's other Element Yoga DVDs, but this one didn't click with me; I'm glad it was just a library loan.  Here are some of the issues I had with it:

*The flow of the sequences.  Turner tends to do a very long series of postures on one side of the body before doing them on the other side of the body--in reverse order.  This felt VERY unbalanced to me.
*The length of the yoga segments.  The DVD is billed as having 5 15-minute yoga segments, so I was expecting short routines that I could use as post-workout add-ons.  Well, 2 of the 5 routines clock in under 15 minutes (at 14:39 and 14:40), but the other three were well over (16:52, 16:52, 17:40).  And in truth, ALL of the routines was actually significantly longer than this, as 2-minute breath intro and a 7.5 minute shavasana were AUTOMATICALLY added to EVERY routine--so each routine was actually OVER 25 MINUTES!

That being said, the DVD is programmable, which is nice, and the breath warm-up and shavasana are only played once if you program multiple segments.  I've offered a brief breakdown of each practice below, including the time for the segment (without the breath warm-up or shavasana).

STRENGTH & STAMINA (14:39)
This routine is supposed to focus on the lower body; Turner does spend a lot of time on one-legged balance work.  She includes Kundalini yoga moves, such as a fists of fire kriya.

ENERGY & FLEXIBILITY (14:40)
As suggested by the title, this section focuses on flexibility; it does this mainly through hip-focused work.  Moves include three-legged dog, low lunge, and fire log pose.

CORE POWER (17:40)
I'm not sure how this practice was supposed to address the cardiovascular system (as billed on the DVD case), but it did focus on the core through yoga crunches on the floor and standing twists.

STRETCH & RESTORE (16:59)
I found it very odd that this segment had ""restore"" in the title, as it mainly focused on backbends, which are energizing!  Poses included were cobra, locust, sphinx, dancer's, bow (2x), and side bow.

STRESS RELIEF & MEDITATION (16:52)
This practice was designed with ""seated poses to flush out stress,"" and I probably liked it marginally better than the others.  It included swim-type movements to open the shoulders, twisting lunge, warrior 1, and cow-face arms.

As a long-time yoga practitioner and new yoga instructor, these routines simply did not fit with how I enjoy practicing or how I like to teach.  Like all of the Element products, this DVD has high production values, but I think even this series offers better choices.",1473465600,,2595,4.78876404494382
