8744696,5,B019CZNG72,"Awesome, beautiful silhouette animated fairy tales.  This is a must-have if you're a Lotte Reiniger fan, a silhouette animation fan, or a fan of early animation.  The cover states the DVD is silent, but there is sound on many of the film shorts.  SO highly recommended!",1463270400,4,269,4.804347826086956
