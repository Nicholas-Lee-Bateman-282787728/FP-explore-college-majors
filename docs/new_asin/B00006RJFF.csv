1789242,5,B00006RJFF,"Us sad-sack fans of softcore have a rather daunting task -- to find a Cinemax softcore flick that ably demonstrates the numerous desired aspects of the genre, as well as the obligatory 'plot thread' that won't make us cringe.  I know I'm not speaking for everybody, though I admittedly have been a follower of the genre ever since 1994 when Andy Sidaris' ""Hard Hunted"" gave me this funny, anxious feeling one late summer night at 2:00am in my 15-year-old pants.

The only mistake I ever made with this movie is that I chose it to be the very first Eros release I ever watched back in 1999, venturing away from the New City Releases of the mid-'90s.  For me, this has everything I want in a softcore, and I like a lot of stuff from them.  Namely: numerous sex scenes (both rough and soft), obligatory bathing scene, obligatory lesbian scene, and the really hot Asian girl that just can't control herself.  What the hell else could you possibly ever ask from such late-night viewing?

Is this REALLY a 5-star movie?  No, don't be stupid.  But as an official entry in this specific genre, yeah, high marks all the way.  ""Hollywood Sins"" (directed by softcore mogul Edward Holzman) should be a movie of this type to work up to, not get your get feet wet with.  Bummer that this was my first shot out of the gate.  Every Eros project I've seen since just manages to pale in comparison, unfortunately.  Let me get the unnecessary plot pitch out of the way: promiscuous movie agent sleeps with wrong woman, gets turned into a patsy for sexual harassment and a double-cross, has to salvage his failing agency and hold onto a new actress that guarantees a breakthrough performance for what will surely be a big hit.  BAM.  Reality in a can, right?  But here's the info that you're really after:

9 spicy interludes spread evenly across a 108-minute running time, long for this type of flick.  6 are boy/girl, 2 are girl/girl, 1 is girl (solo).  All these scenes are taken to completion (only 2 feel slightly rushed), and all the sounds of the actors/actresses can be heard, even over the background music.  Another plus about Holzman is his affinity for varying positions, and this movie has many.

Oh... and the lesbian exchange between the Russian and the Nubian... will spin your head around like Linda Blair.  Undoubtedly one of the... Hottest... couplings I've seen in any film.  And I mean ""HOT"" like: slow, very sensual, romantic, soft, and rather explicit.  Eyebrows will be raised, believe you me.

Like I said before, this one is a cut above mainly because of the variety and quantity of sex, along with high production values for a straight-to-video release.  Good camera work, rhythmic editing.  Besides, pretty much every girl involved in this (Tracy Ryan, Kim Dawson, Mia Zottoli, Dee Summer, so forth) is a real looker; some *beautiful* bodies on display.  And -- call me crazy -- but frogging always looks better on 35mm than retrograde video.  And I'd be lying if I said that this little gem hasn't been the scale-tipper for me on a few second dates.  Is THAT reason enough to at least check it out?

Bottom line: always dependable, money well-invested, fits right on your shelf (or that buried space in the very back of your cabinet).

P.S. Not like I should have to mention this to any legit softcore fan, but this review concerns the UNRATED edition available after a long wait on DVD.  Let me put it this way: 108 min. Unrated compared to its R-rated counterpart at 95 min.  You do the sexy math.",1093305600,63,3508,4.6520325203252035
1789243,4,B00006RJFF,I just saw the unrated version. I take back everything I said in my earlier review. The two girl/girl scenes sizzled! The Eros Collection is back!,958435200,,146,4.653846153846154
7972668,4,B00006RJFF,"I got this, Virgins of Sherwood Forrest and Lolida 2000 for a buddy of mine for Christmas.  He liked this one the most, said it had the most ""action"" in it.  Haven't seen it, but his review was positive.",1393459200,,203,4.17948717948718

The more expensive one is Unrated.",1361923200,,119,4.454545454545454

7972671,1,B00006RJFF,"First off this is not the full movie , they cut down a lot of the sex scenes and basically all the nudity. I suggest getting the unrated version.",1309996800,,145,4.0344827586206895
7972672,5,B00006RJFF,Like most of the other reviews I think this movie is very good.  There are both girl/girl and boy/girl scenes.  It also contains a fair number of below the waist shots which are important because that is what makes it different from what you will see on Cinemax.,1209254400,,262,4.4375
7972673,1,B00006RJFF,Lame vanilla sex sandwiched between inexoribly long and idiotic dialog.  Do the men even have penises?  I sure didn't see any!,1178668800,2,126,4.9523809523809526
7972674,2,B00006RJFF,"I'm not sure what everyone else watched, maybe I was expecting to much after reading these other reviews, but I was more than just a little disappointed. The women are attractive that is for sure, but that's the only thing this movie has going for it. The sex footage was over before is started. At the most they lasted about 30 seconds. I'm not looking for hard-core porn, but this was far from what I was looking for. My suggestion is 'buyer-be-aware'.",1149811200,5,454,4.548780487804878

7972676,5,B00006RJFF,"No matter, I enjoyed watching them sin.  You will too.  All the ladies were beautiful, and talented.  No awards for the plot but then who cares about the plot, so long as it keeps taking you to new locations where there are more sexy ladies doing pleasantly strenuous things to somebody.  Loved it!",1122336000,6,298,4.566037735849057
7972677,5,B00006RJFF,"Awesome!  I saw this movie on Showtime or The Movie Channel and it must have been RATED R because there was a lot in this UNRATED DVD version I know I didn't see before.  Kim Dawson is GREAT as always.  Former X-RATED Star now Softcore Star Tracy Ryan is beautiful.  The story is pathetic, as is most softcore, but it is fun.  It shows you beautiful bodies and a ridiculous story that you'll find yourself chuckling at from time to time so it does what it is supposed to.  The only thing this DVD needs is more Kim and Tracy.

The DVD itself is the best quality you can expect for softcore.  Nice crisp picture and sound with no playback problems.",1101600000,26,647,4.289256198347108
