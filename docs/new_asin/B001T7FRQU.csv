8340753,5,B001T7FRQU,"We got sick of waiting for someone to translate from UK DVD language to USA DVD language, and for 69 bucks we got a DVD player from Amazon that supposedly plays ALL DVDs from whatever country. We haven't tested it on DVDs from Khazakstan yet, but it works PERFECTLY for UK DVDs and we are enjoying NEW TRICKS Sixth Series. Also, it allows us to shop around for better prices.
We also LOVE John Deed and marvel at why NETFLIX is so lax in translating these things. Must be making scads of bucks elsewhere???",1310774400,9,506,4.3936170212765955
