Takes a long time for the characters separate from the group. Once they start getting killed by the ""Demoness"" it picks up. Some of the effects looked great, some not so great, but that is to be expected. It also suffers from a very predictable ending.

Watch at your own risk.",1425168000,,449,4.2823529411764705
7966967,2,B00006BS82,"This movie is filmed in beautiful Santa Barbara, California, and features some great nature shots. That's the only good thing about it.

The premise was pretty good: a man loses his wife (because he's a jerk) and he goes to see some sort of witch to get a magic potion that will bring her back. Said potion, however, also resurrects the spirit of ""the crier"", a woman who drowned herself a few hundred years ago and vowed to seek her revenge. The newly in love couple decides to hold a party and invite a few other couples to their house. Strangely, for a party with a bunch of couples, there is no sex. Predictably, each wanders off into the environs one by one for whatever reason, where they each fall prey to the resurrected spirit of the crying woman. In the commentary track, the director and producer actually make fun of their own film, pointing out bad parts that I hadn't even noticed!

The acting is awful- I've seen kids in high school plays do better. The writing is bad- some of the dialogue is beyond ridiculous. The kills are not very inventive, and the gore is unrealistic.

In short: save your money.",1202169600,3,1118,4.497536945812808
7966968,3,B00006BS82,"I am an aspriring filmmaker and have seen this DVD.  I agree with the other reviews here but must add that any filmmaker interested in a good horror film on a no budget needs to check the short film on this DVD.  This short film is called Y2K: Shutdown Detected and is a special bonus on this disc.  There is also a great behind the scenes of this short on the dvd.  I wasn't happy with the feature but the short made it worth my money.
Thank you.",1050192000,2,447,4.045454545454546
7966969,1,B00006BS82,"This is such a terrible film! I had to wait for forty minutes for anything remotely scary to happen.
It's a by-the-numbers film about four couples that come together in a country house, & are then killed one by one by the Demoness.
It takes so long to get going as we wait patiently for the director to give a little introduction to each of the couples. So, by the fortieth minute you're screaming, ""Will someone die?!"" (by the end of the film, you'll have wished it was the director).
Then a couple goes off into the dark, and invariably separates so that the Demoness can kill them one at a time. The next day the same thing happens - another couple go off by themselves, only this time they are killed in a slightly different way (by this I mean that at least one of them gets sprayed with a fine mist of blood from the other (this happens two several different characters)).
For best results, this must be seen as a comedy, & not as a horror.
The only thing I liked about this DVD was that I saw some retro-film previews which star Uschi Diggart! (but then you can just buy these films by themselves).",1039651200,,1105,4.3173076923076925
