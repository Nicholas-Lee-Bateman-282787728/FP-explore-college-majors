I was very impressed to learn how the city of Jerusalem expanded from East to West and then from South to North covering all of the Garden of Gethsemane and Mound of the Skull where Jesus is said to have been crucified.  This means that the mythos of Christianity began almost as soon as the Diaspora (the Jews dispersed amongst the nations) took place after the sacking of Jerusalem and the Roman Legions were gone.  I say that the mythology of Christianity began almost immediately because of the expansion of Jerusalem in the manner the archeologists lay out as mentioned above.  The evidence they give is sound: the buildings towards the west were of a smaller quality than the main city proper.  Now the average researcher would not know just how mystical that evidence is that the city expanding westward and northward.  This very evidence of Jerusalem following the mandate of the first word of Genesis: BERESHITH, is unquestionably the most important archeological evidence there is that cities were built to validate the mythos of Judaism and Christianity.  Similar to Bethlehem of Judea being built at 31.68 north latitude, which is another piece of evidence of city building to validate the Christian mythos.  This evidence of Jerusalem building westward is a very mystical nuance that the archeologist is not expected to pick up in his work or commentaries on the data discovered.  This is why I praise this video so much because it only reported the fact and left the evidence stand as it may.  It matter not that most scholars do not know what I am speaking of but let me briefly explain this nuance below.

The first letter of Genesis: BETH is spelled out; Beth, Yud and Tav. Yud is equal distance from both Beth and Tav.  Yud represent Yahweh, who is according to the Zohar the Sun.  Thus in BETH the Sun is at high-noon. Now the word BETH has to open up to receive the new day: so the Sun (Yud) has to set (sunset) in the West since Beth is in the East making Yud as the direction Down.  The Zohar also tell us that BERESHITH represents the six ordinal directions.  Thus when BETH opens up RESH is inserted.  RESH is spelled out as Resh, Aleph and Shin.  Aleph is equal distance from Resh and Shin.  Aleph according to the Zohar is Elohym and symbolically represents the Moon.  So when Yud goes West the new day is dawning when the evening comes as all the days in the first chapter of Genesis gives evidence.  So Shin is south and Resh is North, which leaves Aleph as the direction UP.  This produces all six directions for a cube or a sphere.  The point being made here is that when RESH is inserted into BETH the word BERESHITH (first word of Genesis) is created.

From these first six letters of the Torah the first two verses of Genesis can be read from the word BERESHITH: letter by letter.  From the above explanation it can be seen why Jerusalem was expanded out westward and northward: to mystically imitate the word BERESHITH.  This would mean that the city fathers of Jerusalem at the time saw Christianity as a new Beginning: BERESHITH.  Also when the first two verses are fully understood the Cross of Christ will be seen.  In my explanation the Cross can be seen by the Sun going west horizontally and Resh going north and Shin going South and Aleph (Moon rising) going Up vertically.

There is a great deal more of the Christian mythos that can be derived from the first word of Genesis: BERESHITH then I can give in this brief praise of this video.  I hope it has been helpful.",1301097600,2,3670,4.533434650455927
