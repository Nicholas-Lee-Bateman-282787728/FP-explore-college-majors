8248599,3,B0012ZO3S2,"My selection of this DVD was a result of my affection for the songs of Stephen Foster.  It is a ""curio"" in many respects, with some appearances by actors familiar
in other roles - especially William Frawley who went on to star on TV in the USA -
and Montgomery himself who starred in ""The Way To The Stars"", one of the more
successful fims about WW2 (and a favourite of my late sister who married a US officer and lived there for the rest of her life).  But back to ""Harmony Lane"".
It is entertaining enough in its way and manages to include some notable Foster
songs but isn't the proper ""bio"" that his short but influential life deserves.
The print is passable for its age except for a few fleeting glitches in the
motion during one or two scenes.  If you have an interest in the man and his music
or the Hollywood of a past age, then this would appeal for its curiosity value
alone and I for one am grateful that it has been made available by its specialist publisher for the public to buy.",1331251200,,993,4.243386243386244
8248600,4,B0012ZO3S2,"I live in Kentucky and grew up seeing the Stephen Foster Story play in Bardstown, KY every year.  The play is wonderful and gets into Foster's drinking.  I knew, from past reading, that his drinking was bigger deal in his life than the play shows.  This movie really does a good job of telling a more accurate account of Foster's life.",1284681600,,335,4.459016393442623
