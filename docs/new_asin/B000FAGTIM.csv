8119779,5,B000FAGTIM,One of the best kung fu movies I have ever seen.,1421712000,,48,3.4545454545454546
8119780,5,B000FAGTIM,This movie is great. It has a lot of good fighting scenes and is also one of the funnier movies I've seen of this genre. I know this movie has a couple of different names and I found that this version of it was the cheapest so I'm really happy to add it to my collection.,1419465600,,271,3.857142857142857
8119781,4,B000FAGTIM,"Better than average old school styled Kung-Fu movie, fights, storyline are all good so this is definetly a movie for your collection. I have over 70 martial arts films & while this doesn't measure up to some of the classics (36 chambers, 7 blows of the dragon, the Shaw Brothers joints, the Venom Mob classics, Gordan Lui, etc...)it's definetly worth having!",1287446400,,358,4.885245901639344
8119782,3,B000FAGTIM,"This is a fairly enjoyable Shaw Brothers' flick, an early entry in wire-fu.  I'm not the biggest wire-fu fan.  I prefer that wires are used to aid in the fight scenes, not star in them.  They do a little of both here.

Ti Lung and some other dude (that I didn't recognize) play orphaned princes, separated in infancy, when Jason Pia Piao kills their parents.  One is oblivious to his heritage, the other is not.  They reunite (and it feels so good) in adulthood to come back and clean house.

This is another movie that, although quite strange, is somewhat serious.  Then there are these brief moments of really silly humor that do not fit.  Since they tend to be brief, I can live with it.  Apart from that, I did like it, and Celestial has remastered the picture beautifully.  The quality really benefits the movie's imagination and they should do the same to ""Shaolin Intruders"", which is quite a bit better.

1982.  aka:  Shaolin Prince; Death Mask of the Ninja",1200096000,7,965,4.567251461988304
8119783,4,B000FAGTIM,"I have been watching Kung Fu heavily for almost 15 years..

This is the story of the Emperor's evil brother who overthrows the government and makes himself Emperor.  Only 2 rightful heirs to the throne survive the coup, one goes to Shaolin & learns E-Ch'ing Kung Fu. This is the only style that can defeat the Evils Emperors Kung Fu. Later the two survivors join up and discover they are brothers.  The evil Emperor better look out..

Anyhow, you get the picture... Classic SHAW BROS plot: murder & revenge made possible by Shaolin Kung Fu...
The fights are good but not the best I have seen, but what is great is the manner the E-Ch'ing Kung Fu is portrayed.. It really seems like it is the ULTIMATE KUNG FU & when the heroes face the 18 Buddha's look out it's awesome..
I would recommend this Film, u can't go wrong..

Also, check out Crippled Avengers, Two Champs Of Shaolin, Warriors Two & Seven Grand Masters 2; Mystery of Chess Boxing (aka ninja checkmate), Buddha Assassinator, Chinese Super Ninjas, Shogun Assassin, Iron Monkey....  These are ALL AWESOME TITLES.. Check them out You'll love the ...
They Are GREAT KUNG FU!!!",1196812800,7,1132,4.663316582914573
8119784,3,B000FAGTIM,"Not bad for a Kung Fu Wire Flick.

This is a shaw brothers joint and is well filmed and choreographed.

The fight scenes, even though wire, are pretty tight.

The story line is unique and original.

Worth a rental!",1168560000,,214,4.410256410256411
