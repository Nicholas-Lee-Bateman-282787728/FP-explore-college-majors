7752182,5,B01FXM2ZRU,Barakamon is one of my favorite animes of all time. I love its simplicity and how it captures your heart from the first episode until the end. A must watch if you want a relaxing and light anime.,1479427200,3,195,4.157894736842105
7752183,5,B01FXM2ZRU,"Handa Seishuu is a young and talented calligrapher who gets himself exiled to a rural island after he punches a famous curator for criticizing his work. Used to the city life, living in the country comes with a few shocks, one of which being how friendly and welcoming the inhabitants are. A group of the local children adopt him, frequently inviting themselves over to play and dragging him out on various adventures. Over the corse of his time there he rediscovers what it was he loves about calligraphy.

This is a really sweet slice of life show that manages to be equal parts relaxing, engaging, and heartwarming. The charters are a bit quirky and fairly well developed. Naru, the little girl, manages to be adorable without being obnoxious and is also one of the more believable child characters I've seen in anime.

There is also a 12 episode prequel series called Handa-Kun about Handa's time in high school (not necessary to enjoy this series).",1478649600,2,953,4.804878048780488

7752186,5,B01FXM2ZRU,"Loved it. I've kept up with the manga, so was very happy we got a release here. Heartwarming, funny, just a good story. Actually watched it both subbed and dubbed, and thought they both were great. Both actresses for Naru were spot on. Highly recommended! Hoping for a second season.",1472169600,2,283,4.68
7752187,5,B01FXM2ZRU,"I'm not going to go into detail, but this is a solid release of a heartwarming and funny story. If you like anime about children, family, or just something for your family to sit together and watch, this show fits the bill.",1470700800,2,223,4.333333333333333

7752189,5,B01FXM2ZRU,"This series has to be my favorite series. It's a rather unknown and underrated one. It's serious when it needs to be and incredibly funny throughout. The animation is great and the relationship development between Seish Handa, a young and somewhat arrogant professional calligrapher, and Naru Kotoishi, a six year old kid, is incredible. The story is pretty interesting and the characters are great and compelling in their own way, including the eccentric villagers. Both the tone and story remind me of ""Your Lie In April"". This in my opinion, is a simple story executed well with a great mix of humor and amazing development. In the great words of Jeremy Jahns this series is... AWESOMETACULAR.",1465430400,12,696,5.008620689655173
8761783,3,B01FXM2ZRU,"I was super excited to watch this once it arrived but I noticed my copy didn't come with a slip cover and I heard something rattling inside. I open it and see some chipped plastic parts from the inside of the case. Not only that, but my copy would stop during episode 8 and skip to a further part of the show. The products arriving condition gets 3 stars but I will later rate higher once my replacement arrives and is thoroughly expected. Also, this show is so lighthearted and comedic. I highly recommend you watch it.",1520035200,,520,4.371134020618556
8761784,5,B01FXM2ZRU,"Great series - very funny and a ""feel good"" title to boot! Recommended to almost any anime fan, regardless of those with a preferred genre as Barakamon is exceptionally well made, VERY funny, the artwork is exemplary and the characters are all very well done. What's more, some of the calligraphy is truly unbelievable.",1502064000,2,319,4.925925925925926

8761789,5,B01FXM2ZRU,"I actually started watching Barakamon on a whim.  I didn't have any expectations for it whatsoever and yet, it was one of the best anime I've seen to date. Barakamon has a very relaxing atmosphere. It is a very sweet, adorable, sincere, and funny anime that I absolutely loved! My one regret is that Barakamon isn't longer than 12 episodes... The animation served it's purpose splendidly and really added to the relaxed feel. It was lovely, yet not overdone. The OST was also impeccably chosen and also added wonderfully to the overall ambience. The characters were lovable, funny, and incredibly entertaining. I loved each and every one of them and that is extraordinarily rare as there is usually at least one that I dislike.

Overall, I highly recommend Barakamon. It's the perfect anime to settle down and relax you after a bad day ... or if you just want something to make you smile. Definitely one that needs to be added to your collection!",1488758400,4,946,4.762195121951219

The anime itself was even better than expected and brought many laughs and tears to my eyes, it's a slice of life anime with humor and inspiration tied into it. Very nice and enjoyable, comes with both English and Japanese versions, I personally enjoy the Japanese version since it has 3 of a handful of my favorite Japanese voice actors! If I had to rate it I would give it a 6 out 5! A must watch!",1482537600,3,460,4.122222222222222
