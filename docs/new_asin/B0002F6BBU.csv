2089712,3,B0002F6BBU,"I am of the generation that prefers less graphic depiction of bodily functions.  And the director/screenwriter didn't miss one. We see Bloom (and/or others) expectorate, defecate, urinate and copulate, all in the space of less than two hours. From that standpoint, ""Bloom"" is a prodigious feat. The novel allows some respite.  It takes almost eveyone more than two hours to read ""Ulysses"" and one can always put the book down for time if approaching overload.

The film doesn't allow that option. Assaulted with voidng bladders, emptying bowels and all manner of sexual imagery, I reached overload within the first half of the movie.  Part of the joy of reading ""Ulysses"" is discovery.  Discovering the multitude of literary allusions Joyce used to challenge the reader or demonstrate his own erudition, who knows which?  Discovering the pensive Molly Bloom's soliloquy at the end of the novel, like the coda of a Mozart sonata, a beautiful finish to a masterpiece.  Discovering the magic of language as used by a masterful writer. Much if this is missing in the film. By all means, watch the film and of your interest is piqued and you are not discouraged by the parade of bodily function imagery, read the book.  You will not be sorry.",1120608000,9,1237,4.913461538461538
2089713,5,B0002F6BBU,"Anyone who still includes James Joyce's ULYSSES among the books they teach should have this DVD. Not only is it amazingly helpful to see the work portrayed so that you understand the way scenes are a mix of memory, reflection, and real-time interchange among characters, but the extras on the DVD, such as the 'scenes' labeled according to their corresponding segments, such as CIRCE, ITHACA, etc., offer a fabulous study aid.

And for those who, as Sean Walsh describes in his explanation of why he created this work, have always wanted to read the novel but never quite made it past page 10, it gives a grounding in the outline of the work that allows a reader to return for another try that not only makes the reading easier, but also increases the ability to relax and just enjoy the beauty of the language!",1114905600,18,811,4.631944444444445
2089714,5,B0002F6BBU,"BLOOM is bound to polarize audiences into those who believe Joyce's great novel ULYSSES should never be tampered with and those who welcome revisiting the glories of the story of one day (June 16, 1904) in the lives of three main characters in the streets and surroundings of Dublin, Ireland.  For this viewer this adaptation by Sean Walsh for the screen works on almost every level.  Walsh was brave indeed to make the internal dialogues of these important and endlessly interesting characters visual, and how he succeeded will be, happily, up to the interpretation of the viewer.

Joyce's ULLYSSES intertwines the thoughts and strolls and inner thinking and perseverations of Molly Bloom (Angeline Ball) who opens the film with lusty thoughts of her well-endowed lover while lolling in bed with her husband Leopold Bloom (Stephen Rea) who is fixated on specific parts of the female anatomy and who holds in abeyance his grief for his dead son.  The other character of focus is Stephen Dedalus (Hugh O'Conor) whose general awakening to the world is both exhilarating and isolatedly toxic.  There is no real story here, simply the meanderings and happenstance crossing of paths of these three indelible people.  If at times the musings and fantasies of Leopold Bloom seem on the verge of outrageous (especially the scenes of his thoughts about domination/submission complete with oddly costumed characters), if the views of the 'snot-green' sea seem repetitive, if Molly Bloom's sexual antics border on absurd, then just return to ULYSSES and the seeds are all there.

For many, James Joyce is an acquired taste and the random nature of this filmed version of his writing will be off-putting.  But for those who still relish the thoughts of the initial struggles and eventual rewards of reading ULYSSES, this film will satisfy. Kudos to Sean Walsh and to his committed cast of Stephen Rea, Angeline Ball and Hugh O'Conor for making it happen.  Grady Harp, April 05",1114387200,47,1964,5.037037037037037
2089715,5,B0002F6BBU,"If you are unfamiliar with - or intimidated by - arguably the finest English language novel of the 20th century, this film is for you.  Like those from many Irish households that have unread copies of ""Ulysses"" on the shelves, I was both fascinated and reluctant to take on this novel.  That all changed once I got my hands on this DVD.  After a couple of viewings of this very beautiful and intelligent film, I launched myself on to an incredibly rewarding adventure of reading the book itself.

Scholars can quivel over the minor points but from my reading the novel, the movie stays very close to the book while masterfully dealing with a number of concurrent plots.  The devotion of the director, the actors and other participants in the making of this film mirror that of ""Lord of the Ring"" trilogy but on an obviously smaller scale.  Often projects done out of love justify avoiding such films at all costs but this time the passion succeeds.

This movie brings ""Ulysses"" out of the ivory tower and out on to the streets of Dublin town where it belongs.",1106784000,23,1059,4.601063829787234
2089716,5,B0002F6BBU,"A must see even though I am not sure that my five star rating is a true reflection of this particular film.  The fact that it is based on Ulysses means that I could not possibly give it less than a perfect score.  There is no greater novel in history, in my own personal view.

The director's choice of beginning with Molly was an interesting and creative decision and I think it paid off.

The beauty of the sets and background is endearing and this production absolutely has the feel of Ireland in 1904.  Other than the tower that Stephan lived in, all of the locations were believable, and the only reason that I say that the tower was not is because I visited the real one in 1991.  I think the choice of actors and actresses was satisfactory even though I regard a better Bloom being cast for an episode of a late eighties Bravo ""Left Bank"" show.

Honestly though, anything that drums up interest in one of the greatest works of art ever written is worthwhile.  I hope people rent or buy this movie and follow it up by reading the book.",1106352000,15,1041,4.329896907216495

But imagine a cast of softcore porn actors trying to read a script adapted from the text. And I when I say ""reading"", I mean reading, because there is not much acting going on here. The performances are so flat and unconvincing that after a while you just think it would be better to just turn off the sound and just read the book yourself. I had hoped for something along the lines of the 1987 movie version of The Dead, which was nicely done. Unfortunately, this movie was not done well at all.

2089750,2,B0002F6BBU,"This film adaptation at only 105 minutes simply leaves out way too much of the James Joyce classic.  It especially leaves out much of the humour, which is inexcusalbe in a heavily satirical book.  Lengthy chapters are reduced to ""cameo"" appearances or are omitted entirely.  Comparisons with the 1967 film adaptation are inevitable so I will confine myself to three:

First: Stephen Rea is a fine actor but simply too old here to be playing Leopold Bloom.  Rea looks like a late middle-aged wreck of a human being and not the early middle-aged, damaged but still optimistic character that dominates the book.  Milo O'Shea nailed the spirit of the part in the earlier film.

Second: This version is simply too glossy, the cinimatography too well done, the characters in period costume looking too much like they just reported direct from wardrobe and make-up.  By contrast the 1967 version, although given a contemporary setting, was filmed in black and white and has the right sense of gritiness about it.  It also gets across more of the humour.

Third: Hugh O'Conor is a much livelier Stephen than Maurice Roeves and the one notable improvement over the first film adaptation.

In short: If you wish to see Ulysses on film best to skip this version and stick with the 1967 original, which is far from perfect but closer to the spirit of the book.  Still better, get the unabridged audio recording from Naxos read by Jim Norton and also available from Amazon.",1254096000,5,1460,4.819277108433735
2089751,1,B0002F6BBU,"An utterly puerile production.  I have seen better acting in school plays and primary school plays at that.  How could anyone believe that Buck Mulligan was a student ... even a mature student?  One reviewer thought Stephen Rea's rendering of Bloom was memorable in its vulnerability - it looked more like stage fright to me.

It contains practically nothing of the character of the book, and why start with Molly?  or was that just to catch the attention of the prurient.

The pace of the film was painfully slow which of course made it impossible to capture the constant turmoil in the minds of the characters.

One of the charms of the novel was the change in style from episode to episode in which the film Ulysses (1967) was at least partially successful.

Do not waste time with this.  Watch the 1967 version.",1238976000,8,815,4.643356643356643
2089752,3,B0002F6BBU,"Bloom is an Irish film of the James Joyce novel Ulysses by director Sean Walsh. Let me be up front- I think Ulysses is a vastly overrated book, with moments of superbness and many more moments of wretchedness. It was Joyce, Woolf, and their ilk that started a good deal of art down the road to narcissistic hermeticism. That all said, while the film Bloom is not a great film, in and of itself, it is a good film, with moments of brilliance, and does a far better job at explicating the events of the first Bloomsday, June 16th, 1904, than the book ever has, despite what pretentious critics say.
  Basically, nothing much happens on that day, yet three main characters- a married couple, Leopold (Stephen Rea) and Molly Bloom (Angeline Ball), and an aspiring artist and scholar named Stephen Dedalus (Hugh O'Conor)- protagonist of Joyce's earlier A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man. The three perambulate about the world of Dublin on that day, meeting and missing each other on several occasions. Dedalus is trammeled by his own inadequacies, and rebelling against the established order, while the Blooms deal with the slow death of their marriage, precipitated by the untimely death of their son, and aided by Molly's flagrant infidelities. Yet, the book takes these circumstances and subordinates them to the intellect, in the conceit of `stream of consciousness' writing, which is basically unpunctuated interior dialogue. Of course, the thing about stream of consciousness is that it is really the conceit, not the real way people think, lest punctuation would never have gotten started. Think of how often your thoughts veer and back up, U-turn and screech to a halt. The mind is certainly not like a river, but more like a potholed city street.
  The film, however, does not suffer from these limitations. The visual image can work on multiple levels with far more immediacy than the word, so the `day' of the book can be easily condensed. Some Joyceans will complain that the film takes things out of order, and mixes many of the chapters together, yet a) this is a film, not a book, and b) that is akin to deriding those who deride Joyce's approach in the book (regardless of whether or not he succeeds- I vote nay), as well as being the height of hypocrisy. There are marvelous images, and truly the cinematography is the best thing in the film. Rea is also great as Leopold Bloom, while ball and O'Conor also have moments of brilliance- including Molly Bloom's closing soliloquy- the last chapter in the book- which the filmmaker wisely opens and closes the film with, so that Molly is indelibly stamped in the viewer's mind while most of the rest of the film explores Leopold and Dedalus.... Almost all of the flaws in the film are carryover flaws from the novel. Film, in fact, would seem to be a medium that Joyce was born to indulge in. Had he been born thirty or so years later I think he may have become the first great screenwriter, and may never have dabbled in novels. Film is far closer to poetry than prose, and Joyce's prose certainly is among the closest published skirts near poetry. Instead of `not doing justice' to the book the film really makes the book far more relevant to readers- hardcore or casual. Its only flaws, outside of the book's, is that it could have been a bit more daring. I mean, if Ulysses is rent of nudity, just how avant garde can it be?
  Overall, I recommend this film on its own right, and as sort of a Cliff's Notes to the book, especially considering the excellent director's commentary. But, it's a so-so book to begin with, so take the former notation in that light. Yes?",1220832000,5,3633,4.677621283255086
2089753,2,B0002F6BBU,"This film reinforces my belief that some books cannot be translated to film. The depth of imagination required to follow and appreciate the intricate interweaving of the Ulysses story/plot/action can only, as far as I know, be achieved within the human mind. The movie industry simply doesn't have the technology to achieve such a feat on the screen. This was a valiant effort, but my anticipated visual bloomsday felt more like a doomsday.",1194998400,3,440,5.041095890410959

 Since I love the television show 24, which breaks neatly into each hour of a single day, I figured there was a chance I'd like the movie Bloom, whose two hours cover 18 of a single day.  Just kidding.  Aside from the day-long time frame, the projects share nothing in common.  Whereas 24's Jack Bauer saves the world at least three times, kills 20-50 people, blows up a half dozen buildings and never stops to eat or use the bathroom in a day,  Bloom's Leopold Bloom (originated by James Joyce in Ulysses) avoids mayhem while walking around Dublin, finding plenty of time to eat and use the toilet during his day.

 Bloom is a shocker for those groomed on current movie mayhem staples, which makes it tough for director Sean Walsh to succeed in his goal of exposing the basic Ulysses story elements to a wide audience, one where he finds very few members have read the book that has been rated as the best of the twentieth century.

 Walsh's approach is to reduce the work it takes to absorb Joyce's writing style, but it could well be that the work is mandatory for appreciating the what happens.  Correlating each of Ulysses' 18 chapters to those in Homer's The Odyssey is part of the fun.  So is going through the different patterns of each chapter, bringing about an oddly rewarding obsessive compulsive appeal.  This is lost in Bloom, where the exact timeframe is dispensed with, losing The Odyssey correlation along the way.

 Still, the basics of the story are covered, with good eye towards recreating early 1900s Dublin and beautiful choices in outlying beach scenery.  Performers are effective, led by The Crying Game's Oscar nominee Stephen Rea in the title role.  Hugh O'Conner gives the Stephen Dedalus character a more ingenuous appeal than found in the book, making him easier to like in the film.  Angeline Ball maintains her figure better than the novel's Molly Bloom, but has a good take on her extended, famous soliloquy, bringing a soft and meaningful reading of the uniquely written piece whose eight mere sentences run about 60 pages in print.

 Her reading is a highlight of the film, taking advantage of one of the book's segments that seems the most theatrical and cinematic.  The other is the Circe chapter of hallucinogenic activities in a brothel.  It would take work to do it right, with part of the challenge being that  the work has to be disguised and flow easily, as Terry Gilliam managed in Brazil.  Walsh, on the other hand, is hampered by his low budget, which lessens the necessary effects for the sequence.  He has his actors play it too broadly, with music that seems to be saying ""This is funny, laugh damn it.""

 The scene will be expected by readers but should take newcomers completely off guard, with no hint at why it's there or what it means.  Most of the film works that way.  Ulysses readers, on the other hand, will recognize most key elements and perhaps enjoy recalling favorite moments from the book so that ultimately the movie becomes a literary, rather than cinematic, experience.",1143763200,10,3043,4.721062618595825
2089755,5,B0002F6BBU,"One reviewer was put off by the bodily functions (almost) portrayed .  Ah well, but that is life.  Does this person ever watch televison past 8:00pm?

Another was so vitriolic I checked their bio; doesn't seem to like very much about about anything.  Ulysses was not voted the greatest novel of the 20th century by literary critics for no reason.  The average novel is to Ulysses as the ""Sound of Music"" is to Mozart's ""Don Giavonni"".

The movie is a beautiful ""abstract"" of the novel and would hopefully tempt someone into reading the novel.  It is difficult and demands some helpful books about it to wend your way through it, but the effort is well worth it.

2089756,1,B0002F6BBU,"I am a lover of practically all things Irish.  I have a deep appreciation for the music, poetry, prose, political passion, beer, and general population of the little green island.

That being said, this was the worst movie I have ever seen....not even the genius of Stephen Rea could save this for me.  I was ready to turn it off after the first 10 minutes, but I was convinced that it HAD to get better.  That didn't happen, I'm afraid.

James Joyce was an amazing writer...I won't disagree with that...and for those that disagree, I recommend forgoing ""Ulysses"" and running far past ""Finnegan's Wake"", and picking up a copy of ""Dubliners.""

James Joyce is commonly only gushed about by those who have an inflated opinion of their own intellect...by those who find it necessary to present themselves as, perhaps, a little bit better than the general public...those who start conversations with something like, ""Well, when I was studying English literature at Oxford...""

Fact: James Joyce (and this film adaptation of one of his best-known works) is not going to be to everyone's taste.  If you are looking for a light foreign film, this should not be your choice.  If you are looking for something to talk to your more pretentious friends about, this is the film for you.",1123718400,10,1273,4.802752293577981

8027588,3,B0002F6BBU,"A good primer for a read of James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" - a read which most readers will need all the help they can get!

The movie, by necessity removes all the rhetorical complexity and is left with only the simplistic story line and so the movie becomes hollow. The title ""Bloom"" is of course reference to ""Leopold Bloom"", one of Joyce's two protagonists, Stephen Dedalus the other.

I think a watch of the movie only for the sake of the movie will be disappointing. The movie has more value as a precursor to a read of the book.

8027595,5,B0002F6BBU,"Joyce's novel is impossible to film because the peculiarities of its form are unique to the written language. It is the same reason that many films cannot be reduced to words because there is more to them than just a story. ""Ulysses"" is more than the chain of events through a single day; it encompasses literary allusions, numerous writing styles, and other elements that contribute to the whole, that no film could capture. This is why the film is entitled ""Bloom"" rather than ""Ulysses:"" it is an entirely different medium inspired by the novel, not a visual copy of it.

Approaching it as a separate work, rather than a failed transfer of the novel to the screen, avoids disappointment. The cast, mostly lesser-known (at least to me) Irish actors, is wonderful, especially Angeline Ball as Molly Bloom. Her soliloquy is worth the price of admission, and probably contributed to her winning the IFTA Best Actress award for her portrayal. The commentary by director Sean Walsh is one of the better ones I have come across, explaining both his general approach to the film as well as explaining individual decisions. For the viewer unfamiliar with the novel's storyline and the different styles of each chapter, the commentary will assist in their following the action.

The sole disappointment is Stephen Rea, whose familiarity compared to everyone else is distracting. Rea delivers his lines in a thickly accented, incomprehensible mumble that glaringly pointed to the disc's major flaw - a lack of English subtitles (the subtitles are in Spanish only).

In all, a valiant effort.",1402272000,,1582,5.030534351145038
