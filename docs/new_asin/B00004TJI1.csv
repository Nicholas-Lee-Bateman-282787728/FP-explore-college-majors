7922805,1,B00004TJI1,"This is one of the poorest videos I have ever had the sorry luck to come to posess. It is less than 22 minutes long, and only contains 2 minutes and 7 seconds of film containing Jigoro Kano, the subject of the video. This is including some quarter screen shots during the opening credits, and  a three second clip of him smiling. The filler is smarmy documentary including tons of camera shots lingering on still photos, and even silly cartoon drawings. One might think, with the video being only (not quite) 22 minutes long, they wouldn't need to recycle footage, but presto, there is a two minute segment, not including Kano, that you get to watch twice. After you suffer through the 22 minute fiasco that the producer calls a collector's item, they have the gall to tack on a 6 minute 'video catalog' of their other products. The catalog spends more time on the screen than the subject of the film. Absolutely infuriating.",984960000,,925,4.640243902439025
