8637256,4,B00HY2ASG8,"I love this DVD. I was a practiced yogi prior to pregnancy and found most prenatal yoga practices/DVDs to be very slow-paced, and really just glorified stretching. I was very tired during my first trimester and didn't workout much at all. By the second trimester I needed something to ease my body back into the flow of working out, but also still serve as a safe challenge for my body. Jessica provides a lower-paced, yet still challenging workout with a few modifications on flow that are helpful to change through during pregnancy. There are also three different time segments - 20, 40, and 60 minutes. I think they are all the same but just continue adding on, but that's ok.  I definitely recommend this.",1458691200,,709,4.717741935483871
8637257,5,B00HY2ASG8,"Oh my gosh finally a prenatal yoga flow that actually works you hard, makes you sweat and feel stretched and good! I am totally impressed with this workout and I think the instructor does a great job explaining the flow and how to listen to your body so as not to push yourself too hard. The instructor is pregnant herself so seeing her baby bump and doing this workout is inspiring to see. I'm only 4 months a long and I'd say I'm in pretty good shape and phew just the 20 minute one kicked my butt. Love it!! I don't feel like a delicate flower with this one like with most prenatal yoga dvds and I appreciate that. We are not gonna break people! Just because we're pregnant doesn't mean we can't work hard...of couse to the limits of each individual. Highly recommend!",1458345600,,771,4.361111111111111
8637258,5,B00HY2ASG8,"I'm surprised there aren't that many reviews of this dvd. If you're pregnant and looking for a good yoga workout, this dvd is great. I also bought ""Prenatal Yoga Vinyasa Workout with Julie Schoen - 60 Minutes for All Trimesters"" and I like Jessica James' workout much better. She doesn't rely on as many accessory items such as blocks, straps, blankets and pillows for her workout. And it's a great flow workout that will get your heart rate up and pumping.  The 10-minute guided meditation at the end is a very nice touch. I feel very relaxed and satisfied after the workout.",1438128000,,576,4.647058823529412
8637259,5,B00HY2ASG8,"It's hard for me to get in to a yoga video, but I know the workouts are good for me. This video is not your normal pregnancy breathing routine, but incorporates a lot of yoga moves. The 40 min video is my go-to!",1427760000,,211,3.9302325581395348
8637260,5,B00HY2ASG8,"I absolutely LOVED this DVD. There's a 20min workout a 40, and an hour, and ask a separate 10min meditation. The wasy favorite part of it because sometimes when I was pregnant, all I had was 20min and it was good to just do something than nothing. Sometimes I would turn the DVD on just for the meditation to relax me and get me in a healthy mindset for birth cause I planned to a drug-free all natural
Birth. Which I was successful in doing. I believe this DVD helped me do that. It's the perfect blend of a hard yoga workout to prep you for labor but gentle enough that your pregnant body can handle it.",1426550400,,605,4.17948717948718
8637261,5,B00HY2ASG8,This is a fantastic prenatal yoga workout!!! The city I live in only offers prenatal yoga a couple of days a week so I was thrilled when I found this home option. I usually do her workout 2-3 times a week at home and it has really helped my pregnancy. Jessica does a fantastic job helping with form and technique. I'm currently 7 months along and feel great. I feel much stronger and more flexible than when I started. I cannot recommend doing prenatal yoga enough to any expecting mothers. I wish she offered a postnatal yoga series as well! :),1408060800,,545,4.405940594059406
8637262,4,B00HY2ASG8,"This is a great prenatal workout!  I have practiced yoga on and off for 17 years, and this dvd allows me to get the cardio component of vinyasa followed by the relaxing components of hatha or yin yoga, so I feel all the benefits of yoga while focusing on my growing belly.  The extra 10 minute meditation and the relaxation at the end of the 60 minute practice are beautiful for pregnancy.  Definitely include one of them to end whichever set you do.  This would get 5 stars, but I would have liked a beginner flow on it so everyone could do it. Beginners could still benefit from the warm up flow, then skip to the stretching poses at the end.  I'm hoping to be able to keep this up in my third trimester, but I may need to switch  to Anna Getty or Hala Khouri, which are less cardio intensive.",1406246400,,795,4.231788079470198
8637263,5,B00HY2ASG8,"My body has been through so many changes already at four months pregnant.  As an active person, I found myself challenged by which workout to do to stay strong while connecting to my growing body and baby.  The rigid workouts that I use to do were making me feel even more achy and I didn't know if they were safe for pregnancy.
I feel as though I have found the ""flow"" of working out again through Jessica's ""We Heart Yoga"" Prenatal Flow.  I broke a sweat while still feeling stable and grounded.
And I love having the option of working out for either 20/40/60 minutes.  On those days that I feel sluggish the 20 minute simple cardio set helps me feel connected to my body and allows me to stretch out the aches.
As a bonus, I feel as though my breath and mind are connecting.  I'm starting to feel prepared for labor through this yoga practice.
Heavily recommend!
I heart Jessica James.",1400457600,2,888,4.423312883435583
8637264,4,B00HY2ASG8,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see that site for additional details.

In this DVD, instructor Jessica James is eight months pregnant.  She explains in her Intro that as a yoga instructor pregnant with her second child, she wanted to design a program appropriate for those who practice yoga PRIOR to their pregnancy.  She reviews modifications, describing how she created three levels of flows to allow for choice depending on energy levels.  Finally, she recommends having props on hand to use with this DVD, including a yoga block, strap, and blanket.

In addition to the Intro, the Main Menu offers options for a 20, 40, or 60-minute routine.  There is also an ""Extras"" selection which brings up music only options for each practice, a 10-minute meditation (which James says is meant to help prepare for labor and delivery), and a 7-minute interview with James.  I have described each of the three main routines below.  They feature James teaching alone via voiceover, with classical-type music in the background.  Names of some of the specific flows as well as countdowns sometimes appear on-screen.

20-MINUTE
James starts this shortest practice in child's pose, then moves into cat/cow.  She uses her ""Flow 2"" as a warm-up for this routine; this is followed by ""Warrior Sprint,"" a fast-paced warrior flow series which includes vinyasas between every pose and which gradually picks up even more speed.  Additional sequences include Frogs, seated Hips (e.g., forward bends), and a brief (about 1 minute) side-lying relaxation.

40-MINUTE
This routine begins kneeling with cat/cow; James again uses the Flow 2 series as a warm-up.  Next is the ""Dancing Warrior"" sequence followed by ""Kali Squat,"" performed on either side.  Additional standing flows include Tree balance and then the Frog series from the first practice.  Coming to kneeling, James performs Hamstring work and ""Cat Pounce.""  The Hips work on the floor includes pigeon and butterfly, and then the practice again concludes with about a 1-minute side-lying relaxation.

60-MINUTE
In this longest practice, James begins with a brief seated meditation.  She then moves into the flows, gradually working her way up to Flow 3 (although she suggests staying with Flow 1 or 2 if appropriate).  The opening series is followed by the Warrior Sprint from the first practice, adding in the Frogs and Hamstrings, and then the Dancing Warrior from the second routine.  Next is a new sequence, a seated ""Arms Up"" meditation; James then moves into the floor Hips work (pigeon and butterfly).  There is a nice sequence of bridge with a block under the sacrum for support, and then this practice ends with a long (5 minute) side-lying relaxation.

James's web site states ""Many prenatal yoga DVD's are soothing and gentle, but they really don't meet the needs of the pregnant woman who is serious about working with her body.""  For sure, this DVD does not offer gentle routines, and as James notes in her Intro, it is intended for those who already practice yoga.  Although James goes on to suggest that beginners could use this DVD as well, I find that hard to imagine, especially mothers-to-be who are new to yoga--I am an experienced yoga practitioner who has never been pregnant, and I had a hard time keeping up with James in these routines!  She sets a rapid pace, often moving on to the next posture before I was finished taking a full breath.  Therefore, I would recommend this DVD ONLY for extremely fit pregnant women looking to maintain their activity level.",1392768000,2,3594,4.994957983193277
