7669749,5,B01BX1EJ1K,"I was just a teenager back then in 1960-61, watching my favorite western on a 19 inch B/W TV. The Rifleman was one of the first and most popular western shows of the time, following on the heels of such greats as Davy Crockett , whom he sort of reminded me of, because of his sideburns and his manner. And in a way, he also had the charm and looks of Elvis Presley. When I watch these shows, I feel like Im being transported back into the past, it makes me feel young again . There sure is a lot of enjoyment watching these golden classics of yesteryear

7669750,5,B01BX1EJ1K,this is my 3rd review each dvd gets better and better. i cannot wait for season 4 and 5 .. the best western ever and i agree with a simular review if they redone season 1 all over again i would also buy it again .,1475971200,,213,3.652173913043478

7669752,3,B01BX1EJ1K,"It was excellent, just Loved it",1474416000,,31,4.333333333333333
7669753,5,B01BX1EJ1K,"The Rifleman was a great, GREAT show. It holds up remarkably well. Rancher Lucas McCain (pejoratively called ""sodbuster"" by bad guys before he wastes them!) is a widower and father, raising his son Mark. He's quick with his rifle, preachy, and unwavering in his principles.

Alas, the show's five seasons are all being released one at a time, for about $50-$60, which is way too much. The entire 6-season run should cost about this much. Instead, when all is said and done, the entire season-by-season collection will cost me about $300. Ripoff !!!, I don't care how good the series was.",1474416000,,587,4.811881188118812

7669758,5,B01BX1EJ1K,"Oh when, oh when, OH WHEN is season 4 coming out????? I ADORE this series and love the DVD's. I have all of them that are released up to season 3. Aching for 4 & 5. The show is about a man and his rifle, but for me, it was more a show about a father and his son. The relationship that Lucas and Mark have is something that everyone should learn from. Mark makes his mistakes, misbehaves, but how Lucas handles him, both in good and in bad... well, damn. I wish I'd had a father like Lucas. Their father and son love is deep and true. And Mark ends up teaching his father a few lessons as well. They are each other's strength and teacher/student. Watch The Rifleman. Each episode is a half hour, so the stories are short, but they were full of adventure, danger, and endurance, with some comedy bits thrown in. If you have kids today and you love them, do them a favor and let them watch this old time western. You'll be glad you did. :D",1471305600,6,936,4.120218579234972

While the audio is not a problem, I just prefer to watch with subtitles, when available. I don't plan to return the Season, but i would have preferred that the option worked. I hope that maybe they will be operating on the other discs.",1464825600,2,408,4.311688311688312
