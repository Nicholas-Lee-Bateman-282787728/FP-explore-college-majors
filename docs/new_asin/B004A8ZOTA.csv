4298620,2,B004A8ZOTA,"I. Overview
""The Guild"" is a comedy web series about online gaming written by Felicia Day, who also stars as the main character, Cyd Sherman/Codex. The title refers to a group of gamers, known in the game as ""The Knights of Good,"" who play an MMORPG together and decide to meet each other in person upon Cyd's suggestion. The remainder of the series follows the Knights of Good and their interactions with each other after, both online and offline. The members of the guild refer to each other by the names of their avatars in the game: Codex (the main character, who plays a priestess), Zaboo (a half-Indian, half-Jewish guy who plays a warlock), Vork (a middle-aged stickler for rules who plays a warrior), Bladezz (a cocky and arrogant teenager who plays a rogue), Clara (a negligent mother who plays a mage), and Tinkerballa (a diva Asian girl who plays a ranger). Other characters are introduced at different points in the series, including a rival guild and several minor characters.

II. The Pros
Season I is quite arguably the best season of the entire series. Anyone who has had extensive online gaming experience can relate to the guild and their addictions to the online game they play, which seems to be a fantasy setting similar to that of World of Warcraft (which some members of the cast admit to playing in interviews). Zaboo's infatuation with Codex is amusing and draws sympathy from anyone who has experienced unrequited love. The cast is colorful and there are some truly original moments, as the ""boss battle"" with Zaboo's mother. All in all, the first season leaves us curious to see what will become of this motley crew of gamers.

III. The Cons
Unfortunately, subsequent seasons of ""The Guild"" fail to build upon the great groundwork that is set in the first season. Although there are many directions Felicia Day could have taken to develop her plot, none of the characters experience real growth or change. The result is a stagnant stream of antics where truly amusing moments are few and far between and the underdeveloped characters that surround Codex are little more than one-dimensional caricatures. Zaboo's Steve Urkel-like obsession with Codex borders on nausea, Vork is a hypocrite who professes to do good in the game while committing illegal and unethical acts in reality, Clara makes us wish the police would show up and slap her with cuffs for a disturbingly overt display of child neglect, and Tinkerballa convinces us that the modern woman is a gold-digging, man-eating, potty-mouth lump of vanity.

Codex herself turns out to be no more interesting/appealing than the characters with whom she interacts. Supposedly shy and demure, Codex/Cyd: obstinately demoralizes Zaboo, blackmails a fellow guild member, encourages a fight over herself at a party, assumes control of the guild, defeats a rival guild leader, and engages a sexual relationship with a complete stranger. It is not clear whether the inconsistencies in Codex's character - like those of Vork's - are the result of poor acting, poor scripting, or both.

""The Guild"" also projects an overbearing, feminist overtone. Codex openly pursues other relationships with guys while Zaboo grovels for her attention, Zaboo's brief distraction from Codex with a girlfriend ends when she rejects him for another girl, Bladezz is defaced when his mom has a sexual encounter with a rival guild member, Vork is ""undateable"" and his role as leader is surmounted by Tinkerballa and Clara when they reject his guild hall, and Clara dominates her husband while refusing to interact with the couple's children herself. Clearly, this is a series that lacks any strong male characters. The effect here is an estrogen-saturated view of online gaming that alienates the male audience.

Finally, we never see the actual game that is being played until Season IV, and then only briefly. Up until this point, we see interaction between members of the guild only in real-time - typically, with each character sitting at their respective PC, holding conversation through mic and headphones.

IV. Summary
At first glance, ""The Guild"" appears to be the interesting and untold story of the online gamer's world. Upon deeper inspection, the series does not deliver what it purports to be. Rather, it is a polarized and overreaching attempt to dramatize a popular past-time. Indeed, ""The Guild"" owes its popularity to online gaming itself, rather than the ingenuity of its script or the quality of its performance.",1320105600,6,4483,5.043184885290149

4298751,4,B004A8ZOTA,"Worth the money if you have a slow internet connection, or you just want to support your favorite independent film (internet?) producers. The Guild continues to be a guilty pleasure for we few, we (not so) proud, we gamers!",1319328000,,223,4.743589743589744
4298752,5,B004A8ZOTA,"I only wish the seasons were longer. This show is hilarious and a real treat for gamers. Anyone who knows even a little bit about the ""geek culture"" will enjoy the humor. Felecia Day is adorable!",1318550400,,195,4.444444444444445
4298753,5,B004A8ZOTA,I can watch all 4 seasons over and over! Am currently watching on Netflix but will definitely be buying the DVD's at some point because the commentaries have to be great. Can't wait for season 5 to be on Netflix!,1313798400,,212,4.325
4298754,2,B004A8ZOTA,"For whatever reason, the commentaries recorded on every season of The Guild's dvds are terrible in terms of the audio.  You simply cannot hear half the people's commentaries on any of them - this one included.

Look, I give The Guild as a series 5 stars - every single season is hilarious and biting and so, so much fun.  But I buy the dvds for the extras, especially the commentaries!  I want to hear what ALL of them are saying, and you just can't.  It's so frustrating.

Like I wrote in a review of the first 2 seasons, it's a damn shame that we are missing out on what these people are saying because with this group of talented actors, writers and directors, you just KNOW they are being hilarious.

Felicia!  We love you, and everyone on The Guild!  Please invest in decent mics for everyone participating in the commentaries!!!",1311552000,2,834,4.506666666666667
4298755,5,B004A8ZOTA,"This is an excellent example of what can be done on a low budget.
Felicia Day is wonderful to watch as she thinks aloud in front of her cam.
She and her fellow associates are all too human and even if you know nothing
about the World of Warcraft , there is much here to keep you entertained.
This is the first of a three pack DVD set and it just gets better as the series
progresses. For those not quite up to the language of gaming , there is a glossay
included with the first DVD.",1310860800,,482,3.979381443298969

4298757,5,B004A8ZOTA,"I know, You can watch this on line, but owning a copy that can be shared with friends and watch whenever wherever I want is FINE. The storyline is the BEST and if your a gamer (RPG, WOW, Etc) you'll get this.",1305504000,,208,3.9761904761904763
4298758,5,B004A8ZOTA,"I have loved The Guild since I first came across them on YouTube.  Having all the ""shows"" together on a DVD is great.  I sat and watched them through in one sitting and it left me wishing there was more than the 4 seasons to watch.  I cannot wait till the 5th season comes out on DVD.  Felicia Day is great and very funny.  The whole ensemble complements each other perfectly...And Will is totally evil... I love it..",1304640000,,417,4.294871794871795
4298859,5,B004A8ZOTA,"I think this is a series that many people would find funny. Sure, it's targeted toward MMO players (and really gamers in general), but it really is just hilarious no matter what.

Plus, Felicia Day. 'Nuff said.

4298860,5,B004A8ZOTA,"This Fantastically nerdy mini series just keeps getting better and better. Felicia Day is incredibly talented for how little she had to create this with. Just pure delightful. Easy to fall in love with all of the characters and very hard to stop watching.

I LOVE this mini series! Highly recommended!",1301097600,,301,4.901960784313726
4298861,5,B004A8ZOTA,"I've been obsessed, frankly, with The Guild for awhile now, and I MUST own them! I cannot get enough of the show, and with the release of the two music videos, things have been looking better and better for The Guild. It's funny, quirky, breathtaking, shocking, and most of all, surprisingly real. Sure, alot of it is a joke about gamers, but the fact that Felicia Day REALLY IS a gamer makes the whole show all that much better! She knows what Gamers like, and uses that to make the show that much better.",1300147200,,506,4.3936170212765955
4298862,5,B004A8ZOTA,"(MANTRA)
I look forward to the final season of ""The Guild"".

I will keep an eye out for all future works the actors produce in their careers.
(Unmantra)

I give accolades to Felicia Day's wonderful work.  I can't fathom how shoe-string budget productions like this have to fight for DVD release and garbage made by the likes of Michael Bay (BLOW S__T UP!) get released to movie theaters nation-wide.  I'll vote with my dollars to keep gifted artists employed and keep me entertained.",1299974400,,483,4.783132530120482
4298863,4,B004A8ZOTA,"I have loved The Guild since season 1, delighting in the way the series demonstrates a love for the misfits who can find meaning online.  Unfortunately, as the budget has improved, the show has added high-quality guest stars like Wil Wheaton and Simon Helberg.  This only emphasizes the low level of talent in some of the original cast, most notably Robin Thorsen.  Her lines are still wonderfully funny, but her delivery still sounds like she has to pause to remember her line, then spit it out as fast as she can before she forgets, then giggle and roll her eyes and wait her turn to go again.  The character is still great for moving the drama, but if the show is going to keep improving along the trend of its popularity and budget, the writer needs to start applying some of the obvious talent toward finding a way to address an actress who is loveable but out of her league.  Overall, another great season for this show and well worth the investment of time and money.",1298764800,,974,4.511363636363637
4298864,5,B004A8ZOTA,"This season was GREAT!! I had a burned copy for the past few months just waiting for this DVD to come out.
The Bonus features are great and the music video is funny. Just a side note: if you are not a MMO or RPG player you might not get some of the jokes that are going on.",1298332800,,273,3.7241379310344827
4298865,5,B004A8ZOTA,"I couldn't wait for Season 4 to hit the internet and snatched this DVD set up.  Very inexpensive and definitely worth the $$$.

Felicia Day and the gang make The Guild fun to watch!!!  The extras included are a hoot!!!

I have recommended this to just about anyone that will listen!  This and the other seasons would make a GREAT gift to anyone that's ever played WoW or another MMO.

Buy it now for yourself and some for gifts!!

5 out of 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1297900800,6,460,4.404761904761905
4298866,5,B004A8ZOTA,"This season is consistent with the other three, being too clever, funny, and occasionally cringe-worthy (mostly due to Zaboo's lines).  The extras are equally as entertaining, with the ""making of"" for the music video being particularly interesting and funny.  I want at least two more seasons, please.",1295827200,10,301,5.382978723404255
4298867,5,B004A8ZOTA,Wow. Four great seasons and Felicia Day hasn't pulled a Joss Whedon yet. That would be killing off a beloved character. I think Vork would be the most missed. Think of the possibilities....  Emmy anyone? Do they give internet Emmy's?,1295136000,4,233,4.825

I'm not a gamer but I can easily relate to this band of loveable losers. their trip to a gaming con was hilarious. And Bladez finds fame, a minute fortune and then is soberingly woken up  to the fact that his fifteen minutes are up. Oh and lots of celebrity cameos.",1405382400,,356,4.235294117647059
