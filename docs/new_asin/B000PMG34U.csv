8192481,5,B000PMG34U,Solid vid for sport climbing intro,1407024000,,34,4.833333333333333
8192482,4,B000PMG34U,"This is a great intro to the sport. Chris is willing to accept a much higher level of risk than many other climbers, especially beginners so I strongly advise the viewers to buy this video, then adapt these techniques to their own skill level and allowable risk level. For example, start with twin rope technique not single, ATC belay device with no moving parts (not counter-intuitive GriGri), wear a helmet(!), triple anchors not dual, avoid single point failures where failure of one item leads to ground fall, don't step all over the rope, avoid series clipping biners etc.",1370217600,,577,4.8979591836734695
8192483,4,B000PMG34U,This is a great introductory video for beginners. Worth the money if your new to the sport. Very informative. Would recommend.,1369353600,2,126,5.0476190476190474
8192484,5,B000PMG34U,"Good video, very informative, thorough and fun. Chris Linder breaks it all down in style with out sounding pretentious. Great intro to sport climbing. If you decide it is for you, definitely go with knowledgeable people or get pro training as there are inherent risks.",1368662400,,268,4.977777777777778
8192485,4,B000PMG34U,"This is a good basic introduction to sport climbing outside.  They explained in clear and concise manner how to lead climb and belay.  There are also good climbing tips.  I would have liked a more detail.  When they went over gear needed for sport climbing, they didn't say anything about ropes or talk about what to look for when purchasing gear.  It the section on cleaning a route, they didn't talk about how to set up a rappel, only how to thread the rope through the anchor to be lowered.  The yoga section was pretty bland (about 10 minutes of how to get into warrior 2 pose).  All in all, there is a wealth of information covered here that is much easier to understand than trying to learn it from a book but, as they say as a disclaimer in the video, it shouldn't take the place of learning from an experienced sport climber.",1275609600,3,833,4.37012987012987
8192486,5,B000PMG34U,"Sport Climbing 101 With Chris Lindner is a fantastic video. I have been climbing sport for about 6 months now and still feel some anxiety when cleaning a route. After watching this video I felt more confident when I went out and I didn't feel 1 bit nervous. I also learned some tips that I never knew about clipping in the draws certain ways and how to conserve energy on the route.
I wish I saw this when I 1st started, it's been quite the re-learning experience!",1239494400,2,464,4.344827586206897
8192487,5,B000PMG34U,"A great intro to the sport -- equipment, vocabulary, technique, safety, etiquette, you name it -- done with genuine enthusiasm.",1222646400,3,127,5.4
8192488,5,B000PMG34U,"I've done enough climbing to be familiar with much of what the video covers, but I still thought it was very helpful. He broke things done really nicely, and certainly covered all the basics I can think of. I found it very helpful.",1197504000,7,231,4.395348837209302
