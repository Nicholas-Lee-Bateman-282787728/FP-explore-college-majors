This one hour DVD with her friends, Christine and Cindy, displayed Charlene's talents, charm and lovable personality to a wider audience. The DVD reminded me of Charlene's exercise series, ""It Figures,"" from 1980s and 1990s that aired on Lifetime television in the United States.

This hourlong workout will boost your energy and self-esteem. Charlene has this wonderful personality to entice even the most unengaged viewers to get off the couch and join her and her friends. Her fellow exercisers, Christine is a real-estate agent in Calgary and Cindy works for the city. Charlene looks great for her age here.",1518912000,,715,5.111111111111111
8190836,5,B000PE3JHW,"Slightly slower paced step workout but still very challenging.  If you use a low step like me you may want to use 1 lb aerobic weights in each hand, but still a great workout - is there  anything less than a great workout when it comes to Charlene?",1403136000,,248,4.145833333333333
8190837,2,B000PE3JHW,"This is probably the most boring exercise DVD I ever tried to do.  There is no music, just some ""drum beat"" type noise. Also, there is no background stage, color, picture or anything. It's just Charlene with 2 others, with a white background. The group looks like they are ""floating"" in air..almost made me dizzy to watch it.
There was no real pattern..just repeating an exercise 3 times or so then moving on to a new one.
I gave it 2 stars because I respect Charlene's ability as an instructor..older DVD's I have seen of her were better than this one.",1292716800,3,553,4.475247524752476
