1850941,4,B00008L3VX,I saw this movie along time ago and liked it.  It was funny back then and it is still funny now.,1280620800,4,96,3.5714285714285716
1850942,5,B00008L3VX,"i first saw this movie some 12 years ago on the TV, and Loved it ever since. this is one of the movies that I had recorded from the TV, then Bought it on VHS when I found it ... and the recently, after long term searching Acquired it on DVD (as VHS seiged to exist).
i don't really care much for the Critics and their grading of the movie. cuz when I look it up in any of the Movie Encyclopedias that's available, the review of the movie is not that great. but I have the right to disagree... admittedly, it may not fall in everybody's taste... but I can't stop laughing whenever I put it on.
The story or plot is as said ... One Big Mess of Mistaken Identity, 3 people comes to venice each with their own agenda, but due to a LINGUAL Barrier, they all get mistaken for one another and each of them, Unknowingly, gets the task that was suppose to belong to one of the others. And from there on ... till last minute ... one big mess.
This is not a movie which needs much thinking or anything... it is 90 so minutes of pure entertainment.

Dudley Moore, ... what can I say ... one heck of a performer. not in the same calibre as in Authur... but his performance is great... as always. I don't really think he as much as smiles anywhere in the entire movie, but He'll have you laughing non stop through out.",1225152000,3,1304,4.113725490196078
1850943,4,B00008L3VX,"This movie did poorly at the box office when it came out, and I could never figure out why. It's a splendid black farce of mistaken identity that never lets up; a kind of hybrid of French sex farce (think Feydeau) and British gangster comedy (think early Alec Guinness comedies). And it's a terrific sort of valedictory for the late, great Dudley Moore. If you love a good farce, you've got to see this flick.",1209600000,10,409,4.466666666666667
1850944,5,B00008L3VX,One of the best movies ever! This movie is worth every penny.  It is an underappreciated classic.,1175040000,3,97,4.705882352941177
1850945,4,B00008L3VX,"Dudley Moore was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy, which is a form of Parksinson's disease, at the age of 62.  That's what killed him, and that's why he stopped doing movies. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed Blame it on the Bellboy.

It was good to see a much older Moore still getting good acting roles.  Of course, he could never do better than his role of Arhur Bach in Arthur and Arthur 2, on the Rocks!

Blame it on the Bellboy is a case of mistaken identity.  It's a cast of wildly unusual characters,like Moore, who plays a timid American salesman, trying to save his job by purchasing an Italian villa for his boss, who we only meet over the phone but grow to loath.

There's only place in the movie you might want to cover your child's eyes, otherwise, its great for the whole family!",1110758400,13,812,4.489795918367347
1850946,4,B00008L3VX,"Here in the late Dudley Moore's last film,he's a guest in a Paris hotel. Giving Moore moral support is Bryan Brown,also a guest. Hollywood dropped Moore after this film and he subsequently had a few short television stints such as ""Dudley"" and ""Daddy's Girls"". Moore passed away at age 66 of complications from diabetes on March 9,2002. Moore's previous duds include 1980's WHOLLY MOSES,1982's SIX WEEKS and 1983's LOVESICK.",1110499200,3,424,5.159420289855072
1850947,5,B00008L3VX,"I've seen it and I would see this a hundred times ans still
laugh. Typical Dudley Moore misunderstanding trama (Micki &
Maude, Unfaithfuly yours)that would make you laugh besides
Patsy Kensit is a very attractive and talented actress.",1032652800,8,234,5.184210526315789
1850948,4,B00008L3VX,"Sure the movie is silly and the story farfetched and somewhat predictable, but it is good entertainment and joy for 1 1/2 hours.",961459200,10,128,4.608695652173913
1850949,3,B00008L3VX,DVD wouldn't play and it came in a shady looking box,1447977600,,52,3.8181818181818183
1850950,2,B00008L3VX,"It had too much sex for a PG-13, the comedy was forced (even for the decade it was made), and the wrap up was sloppy. The only thing that was good about this movie was seeing 'Balky', but even that was a stereotypical portrayal that didn't stretch the acting skills involved. Maybe the funniest part of the movie was the trailer comments.",1446163200,,338,4.467741935483871
1850951,5,B00008L3VX,I really enjoyed this movie. It was better than the original with Jerry Lewis. I loved the plot twists and the way the characters were confused by the hhhhelpful bellyboy. I watch it every time I need a great laugh.,1442880000,,215,4.4
1850952,5,B00008L3VX,"This is one of my favorite silly movies with wonderful actors.  I bought this one to share with my boyfriend, and was pleased to here his frequent laughter as we watched it together.  The script is wonderful as is the acting.  Very funny movie.",1439164800,2,244,4.5

1850966,2,B00008L3VX,"I remembered this movie as being very funny and when I saw it was available on dvd, I wanted to add it to my collection. Seeing it again, as an older person, and in light of the devastation that violence causes ( and my heightened awareness of it as I've matured), I no longer consider it funny. The part with Dudley Moore being brutalized is not in any way amusing.",1349654400,,366,4.242857142857143

7985281,5,B00008L3VX,"GREAT MOVIE!!! Hilarious!!! I have see it many, many times and continue to buy this movie for anyone that needs a 'little extra laughter' in their lives. Dudley Moore is hysterically funny!
The only negative is that I purchased this DVD from a company called RAREWAVES-IMPORTS (found on Amazon) from the UK. The DVD they sent did not work (on two different DVD players). It is obviously a 'dud.'  This company did not respond to my request for a refund.
DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY, but do try and order this film somewhere else, as you will not be disappointed.",1458259200,,565,4.594059405940594
