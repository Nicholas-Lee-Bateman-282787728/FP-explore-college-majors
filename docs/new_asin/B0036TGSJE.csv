4078472,5,B0036TGSJE,"""The Secret in their Eyes"" (""El secreto de sus ojos"") was the Best Picture winner for Foreign Language Film at the Oscars this year. It was a big upset due to most people favoring ""The White Ribbon"" or ""A Prophet"" and left people asking, what is this film? It is a crime thriller interlaced with romance based on the novel by Eduardo Sacheri and was adapted for the screen by him and by director Juan Jos Campanella. The retired Argentinian federal justice agent Benjamn Espsito played by Ricardo Darn decides to write a novel about a case that perplexes him twenty-five years later and through revisiting those memories, more pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into place.

The case was the brutal rape and murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo) leaving behind a grieved husband, Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) who unable to cope sits at the train station each day for a year hoping to spot the suspect. Espsito with the help of his assistant, Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) and department chief Irene Menndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil) investigates and rules out the first accused and spends most of the story trying to track down the elusive suspected killer played by Javier Godino. Benjamn's assistant, Sandoval is a passionate drunk who has moments of occasional brilliance in solving the case but ultimately cannot pull himself out of his stupor long enough to go home to his wife and sober up making him a bit of a screw-up and most of the film's comic relief. When a suspect is found, Irene and Benjamn spend one of the most suspenseful elevator rides EVER on film with him.

At the same time, Benjamn has a problem of being in love with his boss, Irene. Irene is engaged to someone else and due to mentioned limitations of class and upbringing, he shuts down and fails to come up with compliments he wants to shower her with and cannot tell her what she means to him although their eyes both tell a bigger story of longing. In the present, Irene is the one Benjamn keeps bringing his novel back to for approval and they both look back on the story with dissatisfaction at the conclusion of the case and work towards trying to bring it to ultimate justice.

This is one of those movies where the title REALLY fits the film since you start watching the messages being sent with each character's eyes throughout. Sometimes they will say one thing but their eyes communicate something else. The whole reason they came up with their main suspect was through the direction of their eyes in some photos. Ricardo Darn as Benjamn Espsito was particularly reserved in his words and facial expressions throughout the film when talking to the love of his life and their scenes together were full of enough sexual tension to cut with a knife.

The set-up of going back and forth using the past to come to terms with the present is a concept used very often and the layout of this story leads the viewer down a few different paths before bringing in a surprise that is unexpected at the end. What is fantastic about this film is the combination of elements of drama, thriller, comedy, and a great understated romance between two people who work together and fear ""living a whole life full of nothing"" as they gaze at each other but do not act on their impulses. There is a bit of a cliche leaving someone on a train platform scene but it does not take away from the story.

Many people are hesitant to go out to foreign language films because they find it annoying to read the subtitles but regardless, I recommend seeing this one. It is an entertaining, engaging story throughout with something for everyone in terms of emotional range and plot. Or maybe you can wait for a dub version....or an American remake....which will probably happen since it won.",1273708800,70,3758,4.670694864048339

4078475,5,B0036TGSJE,"This ambitious film is simply magic, captivating, funny, disturbing and engaging. The sudden modulations that are included in this brilliant script convey the spectator from the easy laugh to the other side of the spectrum.

Somehow the nostalgical gaze hovers the film as a perpetuum mobile; that unerring chord that prevails in the tango as sublime musical genre. The ashes emerge from the memory. what it could have been and it wasn't. The affective memory is latent like a sleepless spirit. A horrid crime is the gate. The nasty sordidness, the intermingled conflict of interests will lead two men, to deal against the horror of a non sense judicial decision motivated by a web of conceits labeled as top secret.

Both men will respond of different ways. One a la Macbeth, the other a lo Hamlet, when the wheel of the destiny gathers them.

A fundamental movie and probably one of the three major jewels of the cinema in the past year.

Just like that. A towering masterpiece.",1272844800,2,980,4.815476190476191

4078478,5,B0036TGSJE,"Stunning film.  I have to admit I was floored by it.  The production and performances simply soar.  Dar&iacute;n offers another gripping performance, as does the rest of the cast in a Buenos Aires that is atmospheric in its interior spaces, at times even claustrophobic.  The tension of the crime and human drama is sustained throughout and the pay off delivers.

Admittedly I have a soft spot for the films of Argentina, and for Argentina itself.  And I love the sound of Argentinean Spanish, even though I don't always understand it perfectly (grateful for the sub-titles here).  I'm glad to have seen this one in a theater on a big screen for full impact but I'll buy a copy on DVD as soon as one is available (with those sub-titles).",1271721600,14,737,4.666666666666667
4078479,2,B0036TGSJE,"In spite of a few awkward details in the first half of ""Ojos"", we got ready for the second half after putting together some snacks.  But here's one of those 'details' before I go on:  in an off-the-cuff manner Darin's character lists having multiple ""affairs"" (the word is oddly uttered in English, too) throughout his bachelor years.  The snag?  This detail is thrown in to make the character more endearing, to add some interst to his humble existence as an overworked lawyer, and to lend him credibility as a male.  But it's also the sexist type of comment you'd think modern Argentine film culture would have overcome by now.

Still, we decided to plough on, snacks in hand.

The second half is hard to believe.  For starters, this is meant to be a realistic flick.  Keep that in mind and tell me how real the following sounds to you.  The rapist/killer is finally identified when he is caught looking at the judge's cleavage!  Then, apparently, there's no doubt this must be the criminal. Just like that.  You'd think it would take more to be a sexual psychopath.  So, the judge embarks on a mock tirade about the fella's manliness until he finally exposes himself in front of her in what is meant to be the 'daring moment' of the flick. Oh, and then he punches her in the nose. At this point, we stopped eating our snacks to say, ""you're kidding, right?""

But there's more in store.  At the point when Darin's character has to leave the city for his own security, we see a romantic train station scene that could have come out of the world's oldest cliche factory.  Darin boards the train and his lover judge begins running after it, waving and crying desperately, until their hands meet for a fraction of a second on either side of the window pane.  For a minute I thought the movie had slipped into a comical / surreal mode, honest, but no...just more incompetence.

Details like the above abound and stretch the audience's credulity.  Not to bore you with more, but the love story is so thinly developed that the lovers' final union comes as a surprise, the book Darin's character writes is read by others in minutes, there are at least three endings to the movie, and our woman judge at the end (twenty years later) looks younger than she did at the start.  It's a shambles.

I don't know, or want to know, the director's name or history, but whoever he/she is has volumes to learn about subtley, pacing, realism, and even make-up!  This is still a beginner's flick, regardless of how many years' experience the director may have.

The best part of the film?  The snacks!!

(By the way, here's brilliant Argentine production to check out:  ""Las Nueve Reinas"" which features one of Darin's best performances ever!)",1271203200,8,2723,4.632567849686848
4078480,5,B0036TGSJE,"Director Juan Jose Campanella has authored many outstanding films as ""Luna de Avellaneda"" (Moon of Avellaneda) (2004), ""El Hijo de la Novia"" (The Son of the Bride) (2001), ""El Mismo Amor la Misma Lluvia"" (Same Love, Same Rain) (1999) and finally the present ""El Secreto de Tus Ojos"" (The Secret in Their Eyes) (2009).
With these films he has won 36 awards and 18 nominations all around the world!
He is a solid narrator; his films have definitely an Argentinean flavor and at the same time express universal human emotions and recognizable values.
His opuses are first of all entertaining and deal with everyday issues: mother-son relations, the effort of some neighbors to save a small Social Club from being erased and love stories. Over this backdrop Campanella skillfully play with his endearing characters.

""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is a crime story, the efforts to discover and capture the criminal and finally, when official justice fails, revenge and retribution. At the same time there is a love story, some very funny comedic scenes and some very brutal ones.

The story follows: in a small downtown apartment a young woman is raped and murdered. Benjamin Esposito is the Court investigator assigned to the case and unusual gory crime scene steels him into a fervent desire to discover and punish the criminal.
With the help of his boss, Court Secretary Irene Menendez Hastings, and dipsomaniac clerk Pablo Sandoval he solves the case against the opposition of Judge Lacalle.
Those were turbulent years in Argentina under military dictatorship and a strange combination of issues sends Benjamin into forced internal exile and the wrongdoer enters the police forces.
Many years after these events, the lives of the main characters cross again giving way to dramatic unexpected ending.

Ricardo Darin Campanella's fetish actor (he is the main male character in all the above mentioned films) fleshes Benjamin superbly showing a vast repertory of emotions.  This is not a coincidence. Darin is IMHO one of the best Argentinean actors, able to perform dramatic or comedic characters with outstanding conviction.
Beautiful Soledad Villamil as Irene delivers a performance full of subtleties and strength. Guillermo Francella as dipsomaniac sidekick of Darin is unforgettable.

Cinematography is in charge of Brazilian Felix Monti who has won many awards with this film and with many others, totalizing 18 wins and 4 nominations, all well deserved.
Finally ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" has won the Best Foreign Language Film of the Year Oscar!

This is a great provoking film for adult audiences. Do not miss it you'll be delighted!

4078515,3,B0036TGSJE,"For all the great reviews, I just didn't like it. I mean, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, so I give it a fair ""3"".  I wanted to like it because so many others did like it. And some said the rape scene was unwatchable. It was for like 2 seconds - you blink too long and it's over so it's hardly the worst violence against women in movies I've seen. And rape scenes should be unwatchable, so that is a good thing about the movie. I applaud how upset the main characters were about the rape/murder - they are heroes and have human empathy. As for the rapist/murderer, you never find out why he did it. That was so disappointing to me - the unanswered why.  And how was it all planned? And she was a teacher, was she on summer break? Was he watching the house? It happened right after the husband left for work. The husband met her while she was working/paying bills at the bank he worked at, why wasn't she working? The ""elderly"" character's make up was really bad, also. It takes place over 20 years so they had to make them older. Poor job. Except for the main detective - he actually looked better older - less hairy.  Plus, the main detective's attack on the bad detective after he finds out that 2 innocent men were framed in the beginning was over the top. He had to have known the bad detective wouldn't like being humiliated. Too forced. And the ending. Somewhat of a fairytale - we all want that kind of justice, but I just didn't believe it could have been carried out - not enough information for me to believe it. And the judge/detective love story...I kinda saw the sparks, but just not enough for her to just want to throw everything away...again, forced fairytale. Completely unbelievable for me.",1500940800,,1717,4.376175548589342

Ricardo Darn is superb; Guillermo Francella does a wonderful job as Sandoval.
Don't just view this movie through the lens of the past dictatorship. It is there and it is important, but history in Argentina didn't end in 1983. This film's complexity engages the past and the present in nuanced ways. There isn't just one way to see this film. And don't ignore the love. It is a love story, as well. A profound one.

It's so refreshing to once again thoroughly enjoy a film (regardless of its foreign origin) that delves not only in a riveting Hickokian plot, but also contains a profound richness in fine character study. Thankfully this magnificent Argentinian film has both. Not to be missed.

That being said, I enjoyed the mystery and the relationship aspects of the movie.  The political backdrop was also interesting, revealing a glimpse of life in junta era Argentina. The twist was handled pretty well though it was strangely more satisfying on an intellectual level rather than an emotional one. I felt the acting was really good with the main characters having enough depth to get beyond seeing them as cookie cutter stereotypes.

4078660,5,B0036TGSJE,"I knew from the first twenty seconds that this would be a haunting film, something that would linger in the memory, long after the final scenes had faded from the screen.  Ricardo Darin has a certain kind of energy that comes from the soul, it's more than acting.  Subtitles become irrelevant, you only have to read his face and his eyes which have a language all their own.  The ensemble performances of all the cast are good but it is the lead actors and their hopeless, helpless love which affected me the most.  In some ways it reminded me of 'Love in The Time of Cholera' a story of unrequited love in difficult times.  Subtle, sensitive,, yet powerful, this goes deep.  It's as if the bare bones of everyone concerned have been exposed and we can get under the skin.  It just goes to show that you don't have to know the actors concerned or see box office stars all the time. One of the best films I've ever seen from any country.",1461196800,,936,4.375722543352601

The engaging veneer of the romantic melodrama/detective story is an excellent vehicle for the more profound critique of Argentina's troubling dictatorship, with its dirty war, and the traumatic memory that still lingers over the country. Pay close attention to the background and to seemingly inconsequential conversations - they provide important context for the historical dimension of the story. It's worth watching and worth owning.

The story is told somewhat in flashback as a middle aged DA (or whatever they are called in Argentina) decides to write a book about a crime that he never solved.  It involved the brutal rape/murder of a lovely young woman.  But what has stayed with him all these years is the Love (with a capital L) that he saw her husband's eyes, an idea of love that has stayed with him always.  The back and forth between present and past allows us to see him in a relationship with a co-worker that he could never quite make work....Don't want to give away too much, but you'll enjoy the intelligence and the sweetness of this film.",1449014400,,822,4.311688311688312

4078790,5,B0036TGSJE,"Sigh.... This is the way a romance should end...with a door quietly closing. It was waaaay more sensuous than sweaty bodies, full frontal nudity or other more overt signs of lust. In fact, I'm not sure we even saw a kiss....

Actually, this Argentine film ""El secreto de sus ojos"" (English captions) is a police procedural, well done and beautifully cast. We start with a scene we soon understand is from a book, after which we watch the author wad it up and throw it into a wastebasket. He is a grizzled fellow, probably in his fifties, a retired police detective convincingly played by Ricardo Dar&iacute;n (""The Dancer and the Thief""), still trim and fit, but unable to forget a murder which took place 20 years earlier.

In a flashback (by the way, the makeup is incredible), we see him called to the crime scene and start the process of finding the killer. Like him and the devastated widower, we become very much invested in finding justice for the victim.

The photography is excellent, with seemingly long single takes and noteworthy continuity. The characters seem authentic, as does the infighting at the police department and the relationships in the workplace, namely the loyal, hard-drinking co-worker, played by Guillermo Francella (""Incorregibles"") and the new Assistant DA, played by Soledad Villamil (""It's Not You, it's Me"").

I can't tell you too much because I want to avoid spoilers, but I highly recommend this film. No vehicular mayhem, no blowie uppie stuff, only eight gunshots, four of which may or may not have occurred.

This one is excellent.",1446076800,2,1571,4.913207547169812

The romantic storyline didn't do anything for me (and I found it implausible) but the detective/suspense part was awesome.  Not sure if I want to see the recent re-make because it might ruin this version of the story for me.",1445299200,,490,4.438202247191011

'The Secret in Their Eyes' won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2009. Some critics have criticized the film for a lack of verisimilitude, but others, the greater majority, were quite impressed by the way in which the sordid underbelly of Argentina in the 70s is revealed, when it was ruled with an iron hand by the Peronistas and their fascist supporters.

The protagonist here is Benjamn Espsito who pays a visit to Judge Irene Menndez-Hastings, who was his boss back in the 70s in Buenos Aires. Espsito is now retired but used to work as a Federal Police Officer in the courthouse. He tells Menndez-Hastings that he plans to write a novel about the rape/murder case he investigated involving the attractive victim, Liliana Coloto, married to an unassuming bank employee, Ricardo Morales. Most of the rest of the film involves flashbacks to the time Espsito investigated the crime.

As we flash back, Campanella puts us right square in the middle of the down and dirty world of these 'federales', who are entrusted with bringing criminals to the bar of justice. Espsito is aided by his good buddy in the office, Pablo Sandoval, a deputy clerk who has a drinking problem. The machinations involving Sandoval add to the film's believability as the 'good guys' are shown not to be 'squeaky clean' or overly heroic. Initially, two construction workers are fingered by one of Espsito's colleague, Romano, as the culprits in the murder of Coloto; but after Espsito interviews them, he concludes that they're wholly innocent and were beaten and framed by Romano. Espsito goes so far as to file a formal complaint against Romano, who is transferred to another city.

The real suspect, Isidoro Gmez, is revealed after Espsito notices pictures in Coloto's old photo album who are given to him by Morales. In these pictures, Gmez is seen staring at Coloto and this is enough for Espsito to conclude that Gmez is his man (merely by the look of his eyes). Many internet posters found Espsito's conclusion not to be believable at all but sometimes old fashioned police work involves mere 'hunches'. Gmez's guilt becomes more apparent when he intentionally disappears after Espsito and Sandoval are hot on his trail.

Espsito (much to the chagrin of boss Menndez-Hastings) engages in some extra-judicial shenanigans of his own when he breaks into Gmez's mother's home and steals some of his cryptic letters. Again, the good guys are not always so good. Menndez-Hastings shuts down the case but a year later, Espsito runs into Morales in a train station, who informs him that he goes to various stations and sits there for hours, hoping he'll find his wife's killer. Espsito is so impressed by Morales' determination, that he convinces his boss to re-open the investigation into Coloto's murder.

It's Sandoval who has the brilliant insight that the purloined letters reveal Gmez's passion for soccer (Sandoval's meditation on mens' passion, is a critical component later in the plot). Specifically, Gmez is a fanatical fan of a particular soccer team, the Racing Club, so Espsito and Sandoval have been attending Racing Club's games in the hope of finding him in the crowd. And again, many internet posters found it unbelievable that the intrepid investigators would be able to find such a 'needle in a haystack'. Nonetheless, they do and Gmez now finds himself in their custody.

It's rather neat how Menndez-Hastings takes over the interrogation of Gmez and pretends that he's not their suspect because he doesn't fit the profile of a 'real man' who could possibly rape and kill the victim. She insults him by claiming that he is not well endowed at all and eventually he loses his cool, takes out his member (as proof that he is well-endowed), calls her a 'bitch', punches her in the face and inadvertently confesses. It's a very 'cinematic' scene but the wily killer (who soon is smart enough to escape the bar of justice) is not a very clever psychopath at this juncture at all!

Perhaps the best twist in the plot is when Gmez is released from prison after his conviction and is seen on TV, behind Eva Pern, as an apparent bodyguard. Now it's Romano's turn to get 'revenge' as he tells Espsito and Menndez-Hastings to get lost, as the killer has become a trusted lieutenant for the bad guys. It's chilling when Gmez flashes his gun in the elevator in front of Espsito and his nave boss and even more chilling when Sandoval is mistakenly shot at Espsito's home, in a case of mistaken identity.

The years pass and we're now back in the present. Espsito's ending for his novel isn't satisfying to either one of them (he paints a hackneyed portrait of himself and Menndez-Hastings--with her having second thoughts about rejecting him, chasing him in the train station, as he leaves Buenos Aires on the train for good, seeking protection from Gmez and his associates).

With the Judge's help, Espsito tracks down Morales (hence now, a better ending!). The climax is designed to shock but is it believable? After Espsito doubles back to Morales' house, he realizes that the story that Morales told (that he killed Gmez), couldn't be true since Morales had made it clear years ago that life imprisonment was far more a vengeful (and satisfactory) punishment than the death penalty, where a killer merely peacefully 'goes to sleep', after receiving a lethal injection. Given the situation he was in, trapped like a rat by Morales, do you really believe that Gmez would not have taken his own life? And furthermore, I wasn't convinced that it was so easy for Morales to abduct Gmez in the first place.

Ultimately, 'The Secret in Their Eyes' kept my interest, although some of it was slow-moving and not always believable. As for an Academy Award--some voters may have gone overboard just a bit.",1413331200,,5831,4.87979797979798

4079066,3,B0036TGSJE,"The Secret in Their Eyes is having a limited theatrical run, but it is absolutely worth the search to see
it. Set in Argentina, the story begins with a former criminal court employee (played by Ricardo Dar&iacute;n)
planning to write a novel about an rape and murder case from the 1970s on which he worked. He tells a
former colleague now judge (Soledad Villamil), with whom he has always secretly liked.
Flashbacks tell the story at a time when Argentina was under the control of a military junta and justice in
the courts was not common. A woman is found raped and murdered while her husband was at work,
and two immigrant workers are forced into confessing to the crime. Darins character works with his
colleague, a functioning drunkard named Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella), who provides much of
the comic relief that is essential to the storytelling.
The film has twists and turns that leave you guessing. It has some flaws to be sure, but they do not
detract from the overall masterful storytelling and wonderful acting from the entire cast. This film had

4079071,5,B0036TGSJE,"NOTE: The story depends on several surprises, so I'll try to avoid spoilers in what follows.

I strongly recommend this movie.  It won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 2009, and it isn't a particularly profound movie, but it's beautifully put together, and the two main plots resonate with one another to an extent that is very involving.  The situation is that Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) has retired from his job as an investigator in the Argentinian Department of Justice, and in retirement, he is trying to write a novel based on a case that still haunts him from 25 years earlier.  It was the first case he worked on under a new boss, Judge Irene Menendez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil), a woman with whom he was immediately smitten.  In 1999, she is still at work in the Justice Department, and Benjamin calls on her to tell her his plan to write his novel.  The movie keeps going the 1999 story of Benjamin's attempts to write -- and in so doing to get a clearer sense of the case -- and the 1974 story of the original investigation of the crime, an ugly rape and murder of a young recently-married woman.

In the 1974 story, the investigation does not go well, to some extent for political reasons.  An outburst by Benjamin caused by what he thinks is irresponsible behavior by another investigator, Romano, comes back to haunt him later, when, after an apparent arrest, Romano pulls strings to have the arrested man freed and given a government job.  Romano also, sensing Benjamin's feelings for Irene, publicly humiliates him, reminding him that he is not equal to Irene intellectually (she's Cornell-educated) or socially, and that humiliation affects Benjamin's interaction with Irene thereafter.  Benjamin is also distraught because he has promised Ricardo Morales (Pablo Raga), the widower of the slain woman, that he will see justice done and the killer put away for life.  Benjamin is deeply touched by Ricardo's love for his wife and the lengths to which Ricardo goes to try to find the man they suspect of her murder -- an emotional susceptibility heightened by his unspoken love for Irene -- and it is the emotional susceptibilities at play in both stories that elevate the movie beyond the genre of thriller-procedural.

The movie, for all its grimness in many places is not without humor -- most of that coming in the person of Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella), Benjamin's alcoholic assistant, whose alcoholism masks an imaginative and canny feel for the direction an investigation should take.  The director, Juan Jose Campanella, is careful, however, not to make the drunkenness itself funny, and Benjamin's affection for, and frustration with, Pablo comes through clearly.  Suffice it to say here that one of the most unusual scenes -- at a soccer match -- is a direct result of some brilliant intuition and sleuthing on Pablo's part.  Suffice it to say here too, that after Benjamin's rival causes the suspect to be freed, Benjamin feels his life to be in danger, and there are some tense moments as a result.

What I've just outlined is part of the experience that Benjamin, in 1999, is trying to call on in writing his novel.  He can't find a way to conclude it, and in trying to do so, he relives some of the original case and enlists Irene's off-the-record help in doing a bit more investigating.  What he finds brings the case to a surprising -- even shocking -- and emotionally powerful end, with what effect on his novel we don't really know.  Also, he finds the courage, finally, to let Irene, long since married and a mother of two, know of his feelings for her.  It's important for the movie's success that the viewer find Irene as enchanting as Benjamin does, and Soledad Villamil is up to the task of enchanting us.  Ricardo Darin is an appealing protagonist, both in 1974 and 1999, and Pablo Raga is compelling as the murder-victim's husband.  Well-paced, lucidly plotted, and effectively shot, this is a gripping and emotionally engaging movie.",1405296000,,4000,4.84287812041116

The movie alternates between the past (examining the crime and the subsequent investigation) and the present (follow-up investigation of questions that remained unanswered).  The movie was a little slow paced at times as there was a romantic subplot between the investigator Benjamin and his female colleague Irene as well as a lot of interaction with his sidekick investigator.  The individual acting was excellent, however I didn't feel great chemistry between the lead characters and this made the romantic angle of the movie somewhat unconvincing to me.  That being said, crime angle of the movie was excellent and really made me think about not only the crime, but the investigative and judicial process as well as the effect on those who continue to live with the memory of the crime.

The film is about a retired policeman named Benjamin's obsessions in trying to solve a long-unsolved murder case of the young wife of a newly wed years ago.  The other main story line is about Benjamin's undeclared love for his former boss, a judge named Irene while he worked as a court criminal investigator 25 years ago.  The film flashes back and forth
from present to the past.  The film has a look of a novel spanning a long period with many characters but basically with a simple but deliberately extended story line of murder mystery with a surprising but so what ending and the unresolved love interests in the female judge by Benjamin her subordinate.
The critical flaw of this well-mounted film is the two main characters were played by the same 2 actors who looked they were in their 50's.  With the same actors playing the same characters 25 years ago, even the best make-up cannot win viewers' critical eyes to achieve believability, not to mention the make-ups were not very well done.
As a murder mystery, it is over long and bordering on being tedious.

The detective in chief for the case works under a woman, Irene.  He tries to solve the murder of a beautiful young woman while at the same time being unable to stop himself from falling in love with Irene. Unfortunately, she is engaged to another man. The time shifts continually, from when he first gets the case to many years later when he is retired and Irene is still working in law and is married with a husband and children.  He still wants to solve the case. He also has a sidekick in here in the earlier time and most of the humorous scenes are when he has his sidekick in tow. There is a lot going on in this film but the back half is so strong that the resolution is positively resounding on every level. This film unusually succeeds as both a film noir AND a romance.

a partial SPOILER follows:

one final note: Americans are unused to coup d'tats but they are the norm in South America. At one point in the film, as a new coup d'tat takes place, we see that all the order one has worked on achieving in the country's justice system is for naught. if the new ruling party wants to use the thugs in the prisons, they do so and all your work in putting them away was wasted.

Through clever detective work, he is on to who the murderer is -- but there are many twists along the way and 25 years later, he is retired and writing a book about this pivotal case -- that led him away from Buenos Aires and the woman he loves. In writing the book, he sets out to find the killer and he comes to understand how a man can change many things about himself -- his family, his work, his religion -- but never his true passion. His journey leads him to surprising discoveries about how a husband makes a life for himself after the loss of the woman he loved completely, and how a young man now grown older can find a second chance.

4079205,5,B0036TGSJE,"Watching this movie is a powerful experience. One is thrust into a fully-realized world in Argentina in the 1970s, full of corrupt judges and police, a regime that is steadily eliminating its opponents, scruffy streets, class distinctions, fanatical soccer fans and thugs running wild.

The movie begins 25 years later when retired criminal investigator Benjamin Esposito is writing a novel based on a case that has haunted him for decades -- the brutal rape and murder of a beautiful young woman. Esposito keeps writing introductions to his book (which we see enacted) and tearing them up. Later we discover how they fit into the story.

Esposito's boss is the attractive ands ambitious young lawyer Irene Menndez Hastings with whom he falls in love -- but the social and educational gap between them prevents him acting on his feelings. The scene where Esposito discovers the body of the victim is tremendously powerful. You really feel the emotional core of the movie. The body stands for the ravaged heart of Argentina as well as bringing home the sheer awful brutality of such a crime.

Esposito also bonds with the victim's husband, Morales, whose life is broken by the loss. They zero in on a lowlife called Gomez as the possible suspect. We also meet Esposito's hapless drunken sidekick - capable of flashes of brilliant insight when he is not drinking himself into a stupor.

This movie pulses with emotion, aided by a wonderful soundtrack. Gomez is taunted into confessing after a terrific interrogation scene in which Irene challenges his machismo. But he is released by a corrupt regime and recruited as one of its thuggish enforcers. Now, Esposito the hunter becomes the hunted and he is forced to flee to the provinces to save his life.

A quarter of a century later, he returns to try to pick up the pieces and to rekindle his love for Irene. The movie reaches an incredible and surprising denouement.

the story build up, told in two time periods is excellent. The two main characters played by Ricardo Darn and Soledad Villamil are very good and with a special mention for their excellent make up, you can see them as young and older and the transformation is good.

The basic story is a thriller, a crime committed in the past and never properly closed. This is set in Argentina's troubled times when the secret police is a law unto itself. An innocent victim and deep hurts for the one left alive. The court investigator is left with the unfinished case, the one he cannot leave behind. He decides to write a novel and in doing so starts to do research that will lead him on a different path. Personal relationships and humour also form part of the story and the whole is very strong.

4079232,5,B0036TGSJE,"I used to be the sort that could not watch a movie w/subtitles or would avoid foreign flicks thinking of them as elitist.  No more.  After watching this movie for the first time in 2010 I literally moved to Buenos Aires and lived there for two years.  Although my Spanish still isn't good enough to fully enjoy this classic film w/o the aid of subtitles it began me on a voyage of cultural exploration and self-transformation.  This movie may not have the same effect on others but I'm confident that the intriguing storyline, edge-of-your-seat suspense, underlying sexual tension and a twist that would surprise even Hitchcock, will prove reason enough to watch this film

The Secret In Their Eyes is a movie that doesn't fit any one genre.  Love Story/Romance, Suspense, Historical Fiction, Detective Flick or even Buddy Movie.  If none of those reasons prove enough than the world class acting of the best Argentine Actors' Ricardo Darin, Soledad Villamil and Guillermo Francella or strong supporting performances by Pablo Rago and Javier Godino should help to attract those who have never seen these staples of Argentine Cinema on film.  I could also cite numerous other aspects of writing, acting, location or cinematography that should prompt at least a cursory viewing of this memorable classic but I hope you've gotten the gist of it by now.

4079233,2,B0036TGSJE,"Some of the best movies I've ever seen came from Argentina, but the more like American movies they become the less interesting they become. Maybe this one was made with winning an Oscar in mind, to please Hollywood audiences, and that's why it's so superficial and annoying and predictable - and popular.

The hallmark of an American movie is good-guys-versus-bad-guys melodrama, in which the bad guys are REALLY BAD and the good guys are REALLY GOOD; the bad guys win at first so we get all indignant and outraged, and then the advantage lurches back and forth between good and bad a few times before finally the good guys win, the good guy who's not good enough for the girl wins her heart anyway, and they ride off into the sunset together holding hands. That's been the Hollywood formula for more than a hundred years, and it's The Secret in Their Eyes in a nutshell.

This sleek, glossy, superficial movie could just as easily have been made in Hollywood with George Clooney and Julia Roberts (no... she's too old: whoever the latest Julia Roberts is) - and maybe it will be. They can do better than this in Argentina, but (as with movie makers the world over) less money nearly always makes a better movie.

The film is definitely worth getting on Blu Ray as it is pretty.  The acting is great and I think I am going to hunt down the rest of the films of the main actor Ricardo Darin who was the best part of the movie.  That is not to say that his was the only great performance.  His partner, the killer and the female lead all put in good performances.  The only scene that seemed contrived was the interogation scene but I don't think that it really affected the enjoyment of the film.  I think if you knew something of Argentine political history (I don't) you would get even more out of the film as it plays an important role in the film.  It is scetched out for the uninitiated so you don't have to worry about it if you don't.  The film won the oscar for best foreign film and it really deserved it.  I have been watching a lot of foreign films lately and the big complaint I have is that they are often thin on plot.  So many of them are more moods than stories.  I guess the complaint about american movies is that their plots are contrived and too reliant on three act structures.  I for one like a good plot and this movie delivers.  If you are a film make-up buff, this film shows all of the characters as younger and then as older.  They do a great job with all but the husband of the victom.  I really had to go back and make sure that the young judge was the same as the older version.  Movie magic at its best.  The film needs to be purchased in bluray as it is just sumptous to look at.

4079254,5,B0036TGSJE,"This film is set in 1999 and Benjamin Eposito (Ricardo Darin) is a retired federal prosecutor a bit like a District Attorney in America. He has nothing to do since love has slipped through his fingers and he appears to have been married to the job. So finds himself with time and the past on his mind.

He therefore decides to write a book about an old case - `The Morales Case', this involved the brutal murder of a newly wed to her banker husband, Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago). This takes him back to the events of 1974 when the terrible crime took place. His department were none too enthusiastic in prosecuting the case and instead set up some itinerant builders as they were considered to be trash, and beat confessions out of them. Eposito has other ideas; he has been touched by the love he sees in the eyes of the husband and moved by her effortless beauty. He has a thing about seeing behind someone's eyes and this is a central theme to the whole film, hence the title.

After his boss knocks him back he enlists the help of his drunken assistant, who despite his frailties is very loyal and intuitive and has a penchant for telling lies on the phone (even claims to be a sperm bank at one point). The story is told in flash back using his now reblossoming feelings for his ex colleague Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil); he rediscovers more about himself as part of the process and her too. At one point the question is poised `how do you live a life full of nothing?' That too can be seen as central to the film as people fill their lives with the things that aren't important, more or less as coping stratagems for survival and realise their folly too late.

This is not an action packed film, but it is paced and full of intrigue, all of the performances are excellent, the framing of all of the shots has been done with an artist's eye for inclusion of feeling - whether it be humour, intrigue or pathos.

The direction from Juan Jose Campenella is superb, the period detail is excellent too especially the cars and fashions and it had me gripped from the start, there are not plot twists but revelations that keep you guessing for the whole film and I got it almost completely wrong. It is in Spanish with good subtitles and a run time of 102 minutes and I think would be an admirable addition to anyone's collection of seriously good world cinema.",1327536000,,2364,4.440092165898617

Admittedly, I spent a little too much time trying to figure out the job description/title of the leads especially Esposito (Ricardo Darin).  I'm still not sure but he was somehow involved in the trial of a killer of a young, newly married woman 15 years earlier.  What the movie is really about is the relationship between Esposito and his boss Coloto (Carla Quevedo) who he clearly had the hots for, but holds back...at least until many years later as he is writing a novel.  The film jumps back and forth between the two periods, but does it effectively and with purpose.

4079283,3,B0036TGSJE,"Mediocre films win Oscars all the time.  It's just a fact of life.  Even as recent as last year, we saw mediocrity prevail over true genius when `The Social Network' was robbed of the gold by the crowd pleasing hollowness of `The King's Speech'.  Looking over the past few decades we've seen this trend strike quite often, but in most cases this occurs when one of two things happens.  That mediocrity is either extremely enjoyable and heart-tugging (see films like `Forrest Gump', `Rocky', `The King's Speech') or seemingly profound and manipulating (see films like `Crash', `Tsotsi', `Ghandi').

`El Secreto de Sus Ojos' is neither.

This is not a bad film; it is just a mediocre one.  It is sharply made (a very pretty film) with an engaging scenario, fluid movement, detailed art direction and an interesting color palate to overlays some exquisite cinematography.  But, all those pluses can't outweigh the fact that the film itself isn't anything more than a sharply made thriller.  I don't find that this film does anything new or special.  At times it feels like a foreign take on a television series, especially when the soap-operatic love story begins to cheapen the film's overall effect.

With a film of this sort you really need a strong performance or an intriguing angle to make it stand out as superior.  Take `The Silence of the Lambs'.  On the outset one may discredit it as nothing more than a `sharply made thriller', but when you factor in the character definition within the relationship between Lector and Starling (the `angle') and Hopkins' legendary portrayal of Lector (the `performance') you have a film that transcends the genre.

`El Secreto de Sus Ojos' has neither.

Alas, there is that twist ending that kind of took me by surprise and so I'm inclined to commend it for that, but when you consider the films that were in contention for that Oscar (both `The White Ribbon' and `A Prophet' are two of the best films of that year, `The White Ribbon' easily making the top ten of the DECADE) it almost feels like a joke that this film actually won.

Do I now find myself in the position of stating Van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" is a greater painting than say, Rembrandt's ""Portrait of Aristotle?"" I will never do that. Both films are visual and thematic masterpieces, but operate very differently and tell extremely different stories. At its heart, Eyes is a lush, conflicted romance that is splendidly resolved after a terror filled tale of murder and revenge that occurs in the 1970s to the present; on the other hand, Ribbon is a laser-like, blatant, cool tale of repression and cruelty that focuses on destructive familial details in a small German town prior to WWI.

4079318,4,B0036TGSJE,"In 2010 some of the best films were subtitled,White Ribbon,A Prophet and this,The Secret in their Eyes. I own all 3 on DVD.However the first two are head and shoulders above this,as they owe nothing to Hollywood,they are unique works by auteur directors,working out their own vision. Haneke can place himself in the company of another auteur(refusnik),Godard. This is a throw-back to old Hollywood films and has a formulaic,clichd,soap-opera feel to it. Having said that it is head and shoulders above what now is coming out of Hollywood. Hollywood is already about to do the remake. Oh dear. Having said that there are many layers to this film.

Benjamin Esposito(Darin) a retired criminal investigator,is attempting to write a novel based on a case that has haunted him since 1974,two years before the military coup in Argentina-the brutal rape and murder of a young schoolteacher. This is not a murder mystery,as the culprit,Isidoro Gomez(Godino) was caught at the time. But the injustice of the judicial system allowed him to go free,due to his help in indicting ""subversives""while in prison. Meanwhile Esposito is helpless to intervene and he is not an untouchable like his judge supervisor,Irene Menendez Hastings(Villamil) with whom he is in undeclared love. He befriends the victim's husband Morales(Rago)and is continually trying to keep his drunkard colleague off the bottle. He has to flee for safety north.

The central love story is well acted by Darin and Villamil,but professional protocol and class keeps them apart. Eposito deduces Gomez is the guilty one from many photographs where he's gazing at Lillian Colotta(his would-be victim).There is a bungled comic robbery of Gomez'letters from Gomez' mother's house. Hastings intuits Gomez' guilt from his eyes,and goading him she unzips his confession,and he his penis to disprove her unmanning of him. This shows her in a strange change of character. Esposito's writing the novel acts as a framing device,covered by the film's flash-backs and flash-forwards as he questions people involved. Campanella seems to question the reliability of memories:are they memories or `memories of memories'? Do they evaporate or slide away?

However we are not digging too deep nor led outside of our comfort zone. The result,a glossy film made-for-the-international-awards-markets,which doesn't pack a punch. True Argentinians won't be bought off by this. There are some terrific scenes like the one-take shot flying-in into a football stadium,where the investigators pick out Gomez in the crowd and give chase;an unbearably tense scene in a lift which tells you all about the new Argentina; and Sandoval's killing by government goons. Also the comic excellence of Sandoval the side-kick in a tragic-comic role. I found the love story implausible between Esposito and his boss,but a useful emotional anchoring device. The film is too digressive and ruminative to grip like a thriller. The deepest relationship is between Esposito and Morales,inspired as he is by the other's love for his dead wife. Rago is excellent in this downbeat role.",1301961600,,3091,5.342915811088296

Dime, por favor!  It is a actually a main story re-told by a person who's own life is also a love story in this movie.

The idea that human nature is what it is and seldom do we change our passion is the premise and the reason for the title.  The title is because whatever it is that drives us, we usually cannot take our ""eyes"" or our focus, literally and/or figuratively off this passion.

There are clues, but without giving away the plot, there is a lot to that draws the viewer in and allows you to ponder some things.
And therein lies the beauty of how the detective finally solves a decades old murder, and figures out what happened to a despondent, nearly-suicidal groom who lost his beautiful bride before they'd gotten through the honeymoon phase.  So in love, those two, so how do you move on? and if your life shows that you have not moved on wholly and fully, as in never re-married, even if you had tried to date and never seem to want to find a more solid closure to the most horrific crime to tear your world apart?  What of that?

There is also a sort of tertiary or third story of a friendship that the detective had with his co-worker/subordinate, who was often seen slacking off from work at his favorite bar, as he was an alcoholic.  But one can never judge exactly how much or how far a person would go to give whatever they can for friend ...and the detective constantly covers for him, time and again, picking up his bar tab, getting him home and out of trouble with his wife and getting him to work and sobering him up (the main character was his buddy's co-dependent).  Being the strong, dependable one, this is a sort of frequent routine for him with his drunk co-worker. And yet, the astounding and poignant discovery we, the viewers, finally see him acknowledge when he realizes just how VERY much his alcoholic friend truly did value their friendship and him by the sacrifice he made for him.

I know this review is paradoxically ambiguous yet verbiose but I did that so as  not to provide too much of the entire plot.

4079345,2,B0036TGSJE,"In spite of a few awkward details in the first half of ""Ojos"", we got ready for the second half after putting together some snacks. But here's one of those 'details' before I go on: in an off-the-cuff manner Darin's character lists having multiple ""affairs"" (the word is oddly uttered in English, too) throughout his bachelor years. The snag? This detail may be thrown in to make the character more endearing, to add some interst to his humble existence as an overworked lawyer, and to lend him credibility as a male. But it's also the sexist type of comment you'd think modern Argentine film culture would have overcome by now.

Still, we decided to plough on, snacks in hand.

The second half is hard to believe. For starters, this is meant to be a realistic flick. Keep that in mind and tell me how real the following sounds to you. The rapist/killer is finally identified when he is caught looking at the judge's cleavage! Then, apparently, there's no doubt this must be the criminal. Just like that. You'd think it would take more to be a sexual psychopath. So, the judge embarks on a mock tirade about the fella's manliness until he finally exposes himself in front of her in what is meant to be the 'daring moment' of the flick. Oh, and then he punches her in the nose. At this point, we stopped eating our snacks to say, ""you're kidding, right?""

But there's more in store. At the point when Darin's character has to leave the city for his own security, we see a romantic train station scene that could have come out of the world's oldest cliche factory. Darin boards the train and his lover judge begins running after it, waving and crying desperately, until their hands meet for a fraction of a second on either side of the window pane. For a minute I thought the movie had slipped into a comical / surreal mode, honest, but no...just more poor taste.

Details like the above abound and stretch the audience's credulity. Not to bore you with more, but the love story is so thinly developed that the lovers' final union comes as a surprise, the book Darin's character writes is read by others in minutes, there are at least three endings to the movie, and our woman judge at the end (twenty years later) looks younger than she did at the start. It's a shambles.

As some have pointed out, the 'stadium shot/scene' is worthwhile and the film's saving grace.

I'm not interested in the director's name or history, but whoever he/she is has volumes to learn about subtley, pacing, realism, and even make-up! This is still a beginner's flick, regardless of how many years' experience the director may have.

One last point. Having lived in Argentina for a over a decade during and after La Guerra Sucia, and seen many (far better) productions on the topic, El Secreto's handling of these issues at this late date seems like a)overkill and b)a Guerra Sucia film for international consumption (dumbed down, thriller-ized, etc.).

So, the best part of the film? The snacks!!

4079346,5,B0036TGSJE,"This is my introduction to Argentina's fine films.
I'm happy and  surprised by the emotional weight of a film that I had no expectations of in the first place. As things play out between a low level investigator and his well heeled, high social status superior the obvious spark between them is a slow ember burning but looks like it will never spark with any real intensity. It's odd enough that this man's superior is a very attractive but friendly, well educated woman, but she in many ways stands in the way of his investigation, a brutal murder and rape. The richly textured philosophical issues used here, as well as getting a look at the complex social order of  Argentina's civil servants are done simply and effectively. When political expediency -by way of a vengeful cretin in a high place- takes a turn for the worse it's oddly satisfying and disturbing to see how that crucial moment is later rendered moot.  The film uses time jumping sequences  in a good way. Few films manage this in a way making those involved in the leaps resonate with any or much sympathy. Here we get to see the heartbreak of the investigation as seen through the eyes of the recently retire investigator who is reliving that past. He's trying to put that period to rest by writing a novel based on the events but at the same time stirring up embers of lost opportunity and rehashing questions that continue to nag him in his retirement. That single event had a pronounced affect on his life, more than he thought, apparently, as the story unfolds.
The best part about this film is the humane logic that guides it and the passion that keeps me more than eager to see how this story will end.
From the film editing, cinematography (the soccer game chase footage is amazing) to casting this film is as close to perfect as I can imagine. It's beautiful, smart, beleivable and personal.
I'm not big on award winners for their own sake but this one really earned that award.
Ironically this is so well done I expect to see a much shallower version churned out by the Hollywood production machine in the near future.
I hope I'm wrong.",1298332800,,2116,4.58994708994709
4079347,5,B0036TGSJE,"""The Secrets in Their Eyes"" (""El secreto de sus ojos"") is a crime thriller and love romance, and believe me or not, the thrilling film succeeds as both.

The 2009 Argentine film starts rather slowly with a recently retired criminal-court investigator Benjamin Espsito (Ricardo Darn) trying to write his first novel. Or I should say, he has to tell this story. From the quiet opening the film invites us to Buenos Aires in 1974, to let us know about two things Benjamin left unfinished back then.

About twenty-five years ago, Benjamin was assigned a job of investigating a brutal murder case of a twenty three-year-old newly-wed female teacher. Two suspects are soon arrested, but the truth is more complicated than he thought. Benjamin continues his investigation with a new department chief, beautiful and intelligent Irene Menndez Hastings (Soledad Villamil) and an alcoholic partner (Pablo Sandoval Guillermo Francella).

Like the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock, director Juan Jos Campanella seamlessly blends mystery and romance against the political background of Argentian in the 1970s. The film's slow-burn approach to the plot may require viewers to be a little patient at first, but the result is rewarding. As the skillfully story unfolds, ""The Secrets in Their Eyes"" draws you into the fascinating tales of mystery and romance before leading up to a great climax so full of impact. Also, you shouldn't miss the film's intense and gripping soccer stadium scene (which reminds us of Brian De Palma at his best). This alone will prove the director's talent for action sequences.

Superb acting all around, ""The Secrets in Their Eyes"" (the 2010 Oscar winner for best foreign language film) has been unanimously praised, and deservedly so. It is a moving experience that will stay with you long after watching the film.",1297987200,,1831,5.154882154882155
4079348,5,B0036TGSJE,"Correcting the official editorial review........The setting of this picture is a time PRIOR to the military government in Argentina.  Peron was the president at the time and (basically) democratically-elected.  His ""security"" people were responsible for many acts of terrorism, at that time (to help Peron hold power) and later, in an attempt to disrupt the military government.  The ""Dirty War"" in Argentina went both ways.  Neither side was blame free.",1297296000,,454,5.442857142857143
4079349,4,B0036TGSJE,"This is about an individually motivated murder in Argentina, not about any of the mass political murders that took place there. It's about the brutal slaying of a young wife whose snatched life haunts one police detective even after he has retired from the force. However, general political conditions in Argentina do play a role in the proceedings when the likely perpetrator of the crime is released in order to become a government informer. This provides a commentary on how individual life was deemed less important than mass movement during those times.

The lead character stays on the trail of the suspect though, hating to see him get off so easily. The story is told in flashbacks. During the initial investigation, our hero uses an unusual observational technique to zero in on the likely suspect. He closely examines the victim's family photos, noticing who is standing next to whom, who is looking at whom. This technique has come to be called ""photo-analysis,"" and we unfortunately don't often see TV and movie detectives taking full advantage of it, although ""The Mentalist"" has demonstrated its potential in a few episodes.

Another technique shown being used by detectives in this film is interrogation-by-taunting. This technique is more of a staple of crime dramas. In an attempt to elicit an incriminating rebuttal, a detective will impugn a suspect's manhood or imply he simply didn't have the strength to commit the crime. In this case, the routine taunting elicits such a graphic, shocking response though, that the scene almost earned this entire movie a squelching ""R"" rating. The producers/directors had to plead their case with the review boards to allow the scene to stay in without affecting the film's general rating. They won their case - but viewers should be prepared.

As much as being a crime story, this is a love story - a story of lingering, ""Remains of the Day"" love that goes too long undeclared. This elevates the movie above the slapdash territory of many CSI-like productions. However, there was a false note introduced with the handling of this subplot. When the lead detective and the young assistant who will become the object of his affections are shown meeting for the first time in flashback, everyone declares that he is way ""too old"" for her. However aside from being given a few gray hairs, he is made to appear very much her same age. Then when we advance into the present, the make-up department gives him a few more wrinkles (although he remains very matinee idol handsome), while the woman remains exactly the same. This on-going mismatch of stated age ratios is a bit unconvincing and distracting.

The perennial drunkenness of the lead detective's partner also seems to over-accessorize the plot a bit and to detract from the main story-line. The character's lurching appearances often look tacked on merely for the purpose of adding unnecessary comic relief and of showcasing the comedic talents of famed Argentinian actor Guillermo Francella.

What's more, some of the dialogue goes by pretty rapidly, so you also have to stay agile reading subtitles if you don't speak Spanish.

But ""Secret"" has an unexpected ending that is oh so logical, and yet not the sort of resolution I'd seen to any other cold case drama. Overall, ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" warrants close watching.",1297123200,,3334,4.987410071942446

Spend a day in the office with these coworkers and you can't help but laugh at the unrestrained dialogue that is heard at all times.  Imagine a job at a US corporation or at a government office where being politically correct in what you say is not the norm.  For us who live in a world where lawsuits threaten us for any politically incorrect statement or insunation that may transpire, or where the possibility of lossing a job is very real if acceptable language is not kept, it is extremely hilarious to see how coworkers behave in an environment where these constraints are non- existant.  Seeing this alone is worth the price of admission!  This is a very different culture with personalities that portray a great deal of passion continuously.  You would think that they would become quite caloused in this environment, and yet quite the opposite is the case.  Their extreme passions make them very vulnerable.

4079364,5,B0036TGSJE,"El cine no se parece a la mirada del hombre. Esa es una mentira que algunos se creen. Nadie observa una calle caminando de izquierda a derecha manteniendo la vista fija en un punto, ni aprecia a una multitud desde el cielo. Tampoco podramos mirar a alguien a los ojos y nicamente ver esos ojos parpadeando, sin que nada ms entre a nuestro campo de visin. Y sin embargo, seguimos diciendo que el cine es el arte que mejor imita la mirada del hombre por una razn muy simple: el cine es capaz de hacer que una serie de imgenes, cada una con una carga emocional diferente que se logra con distancias, movimientos y juegos de luces, se unan para ""contar"" cmo se ve y cmo se siente, un hecho. Si los  ojos son las ventanas del alma, el cine es la ventana del alma de los hombres.

Podramos asegurar que alguien est enamorado de otra persona con slo ver la forma en que la mira. Parece mentira cuando lo escribimos, pero es as. Sabemos, cuando vemos las fotos que toman al celebrar un cumpleaos, esas fotos que sus protagonistas miran en un lbum, recordando viejos tiempos, que Benjamn Espsito est enamorado, irremediablemente, de Irene Menndez. Ellos tambin lo saben, pero no lo dicen, porque no lo dijeron cuando deban,  veinticinco aos atrs mientras intentaban atrapar a otro hombre que miraba con el mismo deseo a otra mujer en unas fotos parecidas, pero con un matiz de maldad que, como se ver despus, es el que diferencia a los hroes de los criminales.

Y Benjamn e Irene llegan otra vez a los recuerdos, porque Espsito ha decidido abandonar el reposo de su jubilacin. Quiere convertir en novela las memorias del caso que un cuarto de siglo atrs le cambi su vida como investigador de un juzgado al que lleg Irene, recin graduada de la Universidad, para convertirse en su funcionaria superior. El sabio engao al que nos somete el guin de El secreto de sus ojos es hacernos creer durante buena parte de la pelcula que es el crimen sin resolver lo que l no puede olvidar, para que descubramos que son las consecuencias de haberlo resuelto lo que causa la tragedia.

Ese engao es slo una de las muchas buenas decisiones que Juan Jos Campanella, guionista, editor y director de esta pelcula, ha tomado. La primera y fundamental, fue tomar la novela de Eduardo Sacheri, ""La pregunta de sus ojos"" y juntarse con el autor para escribir el guin de la cinta. Slo un guin perfecto, que no pretende decir con palabras aquello que se puede ver en imgenes, pero que al mismo tiempo le da a cada personaje el tiempo justo en pantalla (y los dilogos exactos y las acciones apropiadas) para poder conocerlo ms all de la superficie, puede combinar en dosis justas humor y drama, amor y crimen, ftbol e historia. Slo un guin perfecto logra que 127 minutos de pelcula se vayan en un suspiro. Y que la metfora se vuelva realidad, cuando la puerta que nos abri la pelcula se cierra frente a nosotros y ese suspiro recorre toda la sala de cine.
Porque ese suspiro es la conclusin de la historia de amor que hemos seguido con el corazn en el puo gracias a la forma en que Campanella nos la cuenta. Cuando Espsito comienza a escribir su novela y a volver en el tiempo, ese caso de violacin nos causa la misma conmocin que a l. Cuando vemos a Irene entrando por la puerta del juzgado, vemos con los ojos de l la belleza inmortal de una mujer hermossima. Cuando conocemos al marido de la joven asesinada y violada, nos ponemos de su parte y nos conmovemos con su mirada dolorida. La estrategia del director para aumentar la sensacin de que vemos por los ojos de su protagonista, es tan simple como inteligente: imitar la manera en que vemos realmente: por eso en tantas tomas hay algo que nos estorba (una espalda, una puerta, un florero) el campo de visin. Por eso el asesino se esconde en los ngulos ciegos. Con esto convierte en una deduccin ""nuestra"" lo que no es ms que el producto de estupendas actuaciones: cada personaje esconde en sus ojos un secreto. Dos estn enamorados, otro oculta algo, otro oculta a alguien, uno ms tiene que esforzarse porque sus ojos de alcohlico no delaten su vicio en la oficina.

Hay ms decisiones impecables. Una es el reparto, en el que se confirma la calidad indiscutible de Soledad Villamil y de Ricardo Darn (la pareja que protagonizaba El mismo amor, la misma lluvia, tambin de Campanella) pero se descubre una faceta desconocida y admirable del cmico Guillermo Francella. Es l, su conmovedor personaje habitando su escenario natural, un bar, el encargado de pronunciar el dilogo que por fin, le hace justicia al sentimiento por el ftbol que emociona a tantos en Latinoamrica. Que el ftbol sea tratado como se merece, (mostrando desde el aire la sincrona de sus movimientos y la belleza de un tiro que pega en el palo) ya es memorable. Pero que alguien pueda realizar una proeza tcnica como el plano secuencia en la cancha de Huracn (hay que verlo, pierde la gracia si se describe) sin jactarse de eso, como si fuera normal que viramos ese tipo de tomas en nuestros cines, para seguir con ritmo impecable su relato, es ya histrico. Por eso no se puede hablar tan mal de la Academia de Hollywood, pues al darle el Oscar a mejor pelcula extranjera a El secreto de sus ojos no slo acertaron: le dieron la oportunidad a millones de personas de ver esta pelcula que de no ser por el galardn se hubiera perdido en los catlogos de las distribuidoras.

Hay momentos sobrecogedores, como el largo recorrido de un ascensor que desciende, o un dilogo inaudible en que un prisionero pide que alguien le hable. Hay un humor que nunca se va del todo, y que arranca las risas del auditorio, cuando segundos antes estaba al borde de las lgrimas. Est latente, como parte de la conversacin posterior, la idea de qu tan justa debe ser la justicia. Y todo eso, toda esa emocin y ese contenido ""intelectual"", encerrados en el marco de una historia de amor llena de esperanza, que algunos juzgan como melosera y que otros llamamos elegancia. Por eso El secreto de sus ojos es ms que un gran relato cinematogrfico: es una de las mejores cintas latinoamericanas de la historia. Una pelcula que prueba  que el cine no es la mirada del hombre, pero cuando se hace con clase y oficio, puede ser la mirada de la humanidad.",1293494400,,6208,4.546511627906977
4079365,5,B0036TGSJE,"The brutal scene in the beginning of the film made me stop the DVD.  My adult daughter and I were going to watch the film.  I didn't know what was going to happen; so I asked her if I could watch it by myself.  As it turned out, the actual brutal footage was brief.  I became incredibly captivated by the film.  Ricardo Darin gives an amazing performance as the man driven to investigate the case.  Although it is a minimal performance, his eyes are so expressive, longing and regret at one moment, amazement and disbelief at another.  Soledad Villamil seemed an unlikely romantic pick for me, very un-Hollywood in her casting.  As Irene, she brings a subtle layered performance to the film with the scene where she confronts Gomez, the suspected rapist, as a high point.  Javier Godino plays Gomez explosive and unpredictable.  Guillermo Francella plays the alcoholic office mate whose assistance screws the investigation up as often as it helps.  His final scene is touching and eloquent.

A beautiful Argentine film with subtitles, with the first scenes aptly describing the unsolved case of a young newlywed's brutal rape and murder.  The film glides between the present and the horrible crime 25 years ago.

All in all, this film makes me grateful to live in the United States, where the justice system is not perfect, but better than most.

4079421,5,B0036TGSJE,"Engrossing, suspenseful and a film from Argentina that exemplifies wonderful cinema, ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is absolutely fantastic!

The Academy Award winner of ""Best Foreign Film"" of 2009, the film ""El secreto de sus ojos"" (The Secret in Their Eyes"" is a film that I can't emphasize enough...""must be seen!"".

Directed by Juan Jose Campanella (""Son of the Bride"", ""Avelleneda's Moon""), the award winning film is an adaptation of  Eduardo Sacheri's  novel ""La pregunta de sus ojos""  and is Argentina's second biggest office success since the 1975 Leonardo Favio classic ""Nazareno Cruz y el lobo"" (Nazareno Cruz and the Wolf).

VIDEO:

""The Secret In Their Eyes"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  The film is shot digitally and there is good emphasis on lighting and also how scenes were captured.  Cinematography by Felix Monti does an excellent job in capturing a variety of scenes, especially in one scene which required a large crowd during a soccer match.

The film does display a lot of vibrant red and amber colors (due to the lighting) or characters wearing red but for the most part, the lighting is well-done.  A lot of detail is captured on the walls, texture on the photo books, twill clothing, cigarette smoke flowing through the air to the wrinkles on the skin (love what they did in transforming the characters for 1974 and 1999).  Skin tones are natural and blacks are nice and deep.  I did notice occasional banding but nothing too disruptive.

But overall, picture quality is very good.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is presented in Spanish and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  Dialogue is crisp and clear and there are times throughout the film where surround channels are being used such as gun shots or a train going through the tracks, crowd ambiance, cell phone ringing, etc.  But for the most part, the film is driven by its dialogue and music.

The music by Federico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer is well done, especially during the more emotional scenes and the score is quite powerful.

But ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is not one of those films where you can expect immersive sound.  But for a film that focuses on romance, drama, mystery and suspense, the lossless audio is appropriate for this type of film.

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""The Secret In Their Eyes"" comes with the following special features presented in standard definition, Spanish Stereo and English subtitles:

  * Commentary with Director Juan Jose Campanella - A very detailed audio commentary as director Juan Jose Campanella breaks down the film and its love story as well as the detective story.  Campanella breaks down each scene and explains to the viewer a background of what he wanted to accomplish with each scene.  A very intelligent and well-done audio commentary from the filmmaker.
  * Behind the Scenes of The Secret in Their Eyes - (4:12) A short featurette on the making of ""The Secret In Their Eyes"".  Featuring crew and staff talking about working with each other and
  * Casting The Secret in Their Eyes - (10:38) Featuring audition footage of various talent for the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When ""The Secret in Their Eyes""  won the Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language"" film, before I watched the film, I was stunned.  Could there be anything better than Michael Haneke's ""The White Ribbon"", Scandar Copti and Yaron Shani's ""Ajami"" or even the film which I felt was the true contender Jacques Audiard ""Un prophete""?  Granted, I have not watched ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" and having watched the nominated films, these films were outstanding but there must be something about this film by Juan Jose Campanella that stood out.

So, I watched this film with the highest of expectations and by the final credits, I realized that ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is not only deserving for its multiple-award winning accolades but for any fan of cinema, these are the type of films in which the cineaste yearns for, movie making at its best.  And not to downplay the other films which were nominated because I enjoyed those films very much but ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is one of those films that stays with you and you can't help but feel that this is wonderful cinema, wonderful movie making devoid of banality and ennui.  ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is wonderful!

Juan Jose Campanella did a fantastic job in being the man guiding force of the film.  Many Americans may be aware of his work through TV series such as ""House M.D."" and ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" but before these TV series, he's had success with films such as ""Son of the Bride"" and ""Avellaneda's Moon"".  Campanella is a filmmaker who has a perfect grasp on suspense but also relationships.

""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is a two stories in one.  Two people who were attracted to one another 25-years in the past, separated by tragedy and then being reunited once again many years later.  But then we have the mystery, the murder case that has consumed the main character Benjamin, as well as the victim's husband Ricardo.  The corruption within the judicial system and no matter how Benjamin works hard to find the killer of this murder case back in 1974, the system works against him.  But it's that careful pacing, where you feel easy at times and then Campanella's knows when to make the viewer feel uneasy and that something is not right.  And this leads to a chilling discovery by the main character that was not only shocking but a realization that many of us were not prepared for and it works with tremendous efficacy.

The performances by Ricardo Darin, Soledad Villamil, Pablo Rago, Guillermo Francella were fantastic.  Every scene was well-done and most of all well-captured by cinematographer Felix Monti.  Not only do you have a well-written story but capable actors to make us believe.  And a wonderful job goes to the makeup department that did a fantastic job in making the talent realistic for 1974 and 1999.  I thought this was well-done.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and audio quality were well-done.  PQ has a bit of banding but other than that, it is a solid Sony Pictures Classics release.  If anything prevents near perfection of this Blu-ray release is the special features.  Aside from the wonderful audio commentary by Campanella, the special features were just two short featurettes and I was hoping for more.  Especially on the transforming of the characters for the two time periods.

Overall, ""The Secret In Their Eyes"" is a film that is most deserving of its Oscar and multiple awards.  This film is engrossing, suspenseful and truly amazing in every way.

Highly recommended!",1287619200,4,6680,4.845406360424028

 The theme of this movie is artfully achieved with such delicasy/shock, combining the threads of story, plot, action, and perception from all viewpoints that it is simply a MUST SEE.

He decides to write a novel about it and returns to his old office to enlist the help of his former partner, a perpetually drunk but true-blue friend (Guillermo Francella), and his boss (Irene Menndez Hastings), a beautiful woman he has secretly loved all this time.

This outstanding film won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.  The script is extremely clever, mixing equally-compelling stories of crime and love. There are frequent flashbacks so we feel we really become involved in the case and know and care about the three main characters.  The grizzly crime is thankfully seen only for a few fleeting moments but its horror keeps the story exciting and moving at a fast pace. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.

The actors are all outstanding, so good I never felt they were acting.  The entire film is riveting, the dialogue is realistic, and there is a great ""what would you do?"" ending.

This made it watch-worthy to me, and I watched it the other day. Not what I expected; I thought it would be an exciting cop movie, with twists and turns and intrigue. Well, it had all that, but is all centered around a bittersweet love story, and I can't recall seeing a film where flashbacks/forwards were so seamlessly incorprated into a riveting narrative. I don't want to blab things away, but the sincerity and honesty of the characters had me enthralled. I had my ideas about whom I thought was guilty, but, even after it's explained, the film goes on to reveal one of the cleverest ""twist"" endings I've seen. I was amused and content...and entertained. Acting by all is excellent. Ricardo Dorin (a Joe Mantegna look-alike) handles the angst quite well, and Soledad Villamil is radiant and confident in an equally difficult role. Some credit should be given to the make-up artist, showing all major characters in their own 20-year  incarnations. No car chases, crashes or otherwise violent behavior.

It was by far so unexpected and done so well I had to come in here and say my 2 cents. It literally had me on the edge of my seat nearly the entire movie. Their is some nudity and brief flashes of violence but the majority of the plot is done with the characters and the unrequinted love that is tangible between Benjamin and Irene. This is a mystery that is solved methodically and it is well worth the time to sit and get involved in a ""subtitled"" movie.

It has been a long time since I have seen a Foreign Film or any for that matter that had the suspense this movie had.

The story outline is comparatively simple. A retired police detective can't quite let go of a case he worked many years earlier. As he tries to turn it, and his life, into a novel, he gets drawn back into the case and his then boss who is as intelligent as she is lovely. What is different here is how the story unfolds. It just never takes the low road or the expected turns. As each new piece unfolded I kept saying to myself how neat that particular plot point was. This had so many nice touches I was constantly thrilled.

All the production values are great. The acting, directing, soundtrack, everything. The aging of the characters is handled well. In some scenes it's as though I was seeing young actors made to look old, while at other times they looked like old actors. It was sometimes hard to believe I was seeing the same actors.

There was a slight struggle to pull some of the elements together at the end but it's a minor quibble. This is a great movie and it actually made me re-examine my point of view on certain topics. I find that happening very seldom in film these days. I saw the subtitled version so all the nuances of the actors' delivery were immediate and that's saying a lot.

Yes this is a crime thriller but it's much more than that. If you are at all disposed toward this sort of movie make it a point to catch this. It very well might change your life.",1285372800,2,1620,4.25

The two lead actors are phenominal here as good acting is when the actor disappears and one believes they are the embodyment of the characters they are playing. This is one of those films. The film grabs one at the begining. It is said detectives can be desensitized to the vilence of it all however this detective is surprised and shocked at the brutality at the crime scene and he becomes obsessed. Then he meets the husband. The husband is beyond distraught over the sudden brutal death of his beautifull bride. Believe me when I tell you one becomes as obsessed as the detective in finding the person responsible for this senseless crime. This film does a good job of drawing one in to the story and the acting is first rate. If you are a fan of good acting, good writing and low tech you will not be disappointed.

4079430,5,B0036TGSJE,"EL SECRETO DE SUS OJOS, based on the novel 'LA PREGUNTA DE SUS OJOS' by Eduardo Sacheri who with director Juan Jos&eacute; Campanella adapted it for the screen, is a work of great subtlety and artistic taste.  It is also a fine love story, detective story, and moral tale that makes every aspect of the total experience of watching the film unfold as a kaleidoscope of just how fine the art of cinema can be.

25 years ago in Argentina  the murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo) drew the focus of detective Benjam&iacute;n Esp&oacute;sito (Ricardo Darin), his feisty assistant  Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) and the department chief Irene Men&eacute;ndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil).  The murderer, Isidoro G&oacute;mez (Javier Godino) is captured, but because of the corrupt government, he is not kept in prison: the disgusting governmental police release him to work as an undercover agent for the government as part of the desaperacidos situation in the 1970s. The case is closed, leaving behind Ben, Irene, and Pablo completely disenchanted by the legal system, and the grieving husband of the victim Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) to sit at the train station watching for answers.  Now, in the present, Ben returns and is convinced he wants to write a novel about the murder he still finds suspicious.  Together with Irene (who remains a love interest for the shy Ben) and Pablo, the three research every aspect of the case. In attempting to discover the truth of the murder each of their lives is changed: the communication on the part of every character is through the looks in their eyes until the story ends in a very surprising manner.  Justice is served, love prevails, and the novel is written.

This may seem too fragile an outline of a plot about a film as important as this, but the true beauty of the film is the unraveling of events and the development of the characters: sharing too much information would destroy the complete pleasure the film provides.  Every member of the cast is brilliant, the chemistry between Darin and Villamil is so subtle and credible, and the acts of violence we are asked to witness are delivered in a way that make the story line progress to a breathtaking end.  Campanella's direction (and editing) is of the finest cinematic achievement and the cinematography by F&eacute;lix Mont and the haunting musical score by Federico Jusid and  Emilio Kauderer heighten all facets of the action - love, terror, violence, and character of each of the actors.  This is a film to own, as repeated viewings of it will be like repeated visits to an art museum.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, September 10",1285113600,3,2650,4.936936936936937

4079432,4,B0036TGSJE,"A retired detective decides to revisit an unsettling case from early in his career.  It turns out not only was the case unresolved, its impact left his life unresolved, and working through the case allows him to reconsider his own past.  An intriguing theme explored in the film is that the quiet devastation brought into a life through fear of change and commitment can compare to that inflicted through loss.

As a young detective, Benjamin is assigned to the case of a woman who was brutally raped and murdered.  When the authorities want to pin the case on easy targets, he persists, enlisting the help of his alcoholic assistant and his reluctant but beautiful boss, Irene.  When they think the case is resolved, an unexpected turn of events changes everything for them, and many years later Benjamin once again turns to Irene to reconsider the case and to put his own life back together.

It's an unlikely combination of crime story and love story, with a touch of political thriller.  Mostly, it works.  The actual detective work is a bit old school - where a bit of investigation and a couple coincidences combine with intuition that is invariably on track, and where a bit of psychological manipulation invariably gets a guy to crack and spill the beans.  Still, as old school thrillers go, this one feels fresh and unique, and the hints of Argentina's political past give this a unique edge.  There are elements of brutality, and the language is strong.  It's filmed well, though occasionally the director employs unique or intense shots (fast moving crane shots or vertiginous orbits of the character) that seemed to be merely showpieces - without clear justification in the dramatic demands of the scene.  Not as intense, say, as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tell-No-One/dp/B001D5C1GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tell No One</a>, or as artsy as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Aura/dp/B000K2V7F0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Aura</a>&nbsp;(also starring Ricardo Darin), it's much funnier at times and the emotional payoff is more direct.",1284681600,6,2143,5.6006191950464395

He was excellent, especially in the last chilling sequence.  Also, I didn't spot a mention on that incredible single-shot sequence in the stadium. A combination of Orson Welles with Alfred Hitchcock as the camera moves from an aerial view of the stadium to the single spectator not following the football game.

The most intriguing aspect of the film comes at that final sequence where all the moral dilemmas of crime, punishment, revenge, right, wrong, etc etc come to a head without any easy or moralistic talk from the filmmakers.

4079436,4,B0036TGSJE,"""The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.""

This, the first sentence in the book The Go-Between by L. P. Hartley describes perfectly for me the mood of the Argentinean movie The Secret in Their Eyes.

For one, it takes place in Argentina, a foreign country, literally. Because it was filmed in Spanish, has English subtitles. But the ""foreign"" quality of the film cannot be translated so easily. The formal way the characters address each other, the constant swearing in their speech, the frustrating bureaucracy that blocks the investigation show a world that is genuinely different to the one we are used to see in the movies reflecting life in the USA. And because of that even more fascinating.

Also, part of the movie takes place in the past (1974) where a right-wing government controls in subtle ways (the political situation of the country is never mentioned directly) what happens in the screen.

Both a crime investigation and a love story, perhaps two, The Secret in Their Eyes starts in 1999 as Benjamin Esposito, a criminal court employee just retired, struggles to set to paper the events surrounding the rape and murder of a beautiful young woman and his role in the investigation that followed. To bring the story into focus, he visits his former boss, Irene, the woman he has loved since they first met. Irene, now a judge, had an important role in covering for Benjamin's unorthodox attempts to solve the murder and is, we see as the story unfolds, also deeply in love with Benjamin. Things didn't turn out well for them in the past. Will writing the story release the ghosts that have haunted them since?

Being a writer I totally relate to Benjamin's frustration at his inability to start his story. And I love the part when, still half asleep, he writes two words in a piece of paper, an idea he has just struck him as important, only to be unable to understand its meaning next morning. The reason being that he wrote 'temo' (I fear) when he meant 'Te amo' (I love you). A mistake that, like many of the situations in the movie, does not translate well.

4079464,5,B0036TGSJE,"""The Secret in their Eyes"" (""El secreto de sus ojos"") was the Best Picture winner for Foreign Language Film at the Oscars this year. It was a big upset due to most people favoring ""The White Ribbon"" or ""A Prophet"" and left people asking, what is this film? It is a crime thriller interlaced with romance based on the novel by Eduardo Sacheri and was adapted for the screen by him and by director Juan Jos Campanella. The retired Argentinian federal justice agent Benjamn Espsito played by Ricardo Darn decides to write a novel about a case that perplexes him twenty-five years later and through revisiting those memories, more pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into place.

The case was the brutal rape and murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo) leaving behind a grieved husband, Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) who unable to cope sits at the train station each day for a year hoping to spot the suspect. Espsito with the help of his assistant, Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) and department chief Irene Menndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil) investigates and rules out the first accused and spends most of the story trying to track down the elusive suspected killer played by Javier Godino. Benjamn's assistant, Sandoval is a passionate drunk who has moments of occasional brilliance in solving the case but ultimately cannot pull himself out of his stupor long enough to go home to his wife and sober up making him a bit of a screw-up and most of the film's comic relief. When a suspect is found, Irene and Benjamn spend one of the most suspenseful elevator rides EVER on film with him.

At the same time, Benjamn has a problem of being in love with his boss, Irene. Irene is engaged to someone else and due to mentioned limitations of class and upbringing, he shuts down and fails to come up with compliments he wants to shower her with and cannot tell her what she means to him although their eyes both tell a bigger story of longing. In the present, Irene is the one Benjamn keeps bringing his novel back to for approval and they both look back on the story with dissatisfaction at the conclusion of the case and work towards trying to bring it to ultimate justice.

This is one of those movies where the title REALLY fits the film since you start watching the messages being sent with each character's eyes throughout. Sometimes they will say one thing but their eyes communicate something else. The whole reason they came up with their main suspect was through the direction of their eyes in some photos. Ricardo Darn as Benjamn Espsito was particularly reserved in his words and facial expressions throughout the film when talking to the love of his life and their scenes together were full of enough sexual tension to cut with a knife.

The set-up of going back and forth using the past to come to terms with the present is a concept used very often and the layout of this story leads the viewer down a few different paths before bringing in a surprise that is unexpected at the end. What is fantastic about this film is the combination of elements of drama, thriller, comedy, and a great understated romance between two people who work together and fear ""living a whole life full of nothing"" as they gaze at each other but do not act on their impulses. There is a bit of a cliche leaving someone on a train platform scene but it does not take away from the story.

Many people are hesitant to go out to foreign language films because they find it annoying to read the subtitles but regardless, I recommend seeing this one. It is an entertaining, engaging story throughout with something for everyone in terms of emotional range and plot. Or maybe you can wait for a dub version....or an American remake....which will probably happen since it won.",1274918400,2,3758,4.670694864048339

I had no idea he was making this film, so it came as an unexpected surprise when it won the Oscar as best foreign film at the last Academy Awards.  I found a copy from an Argentinian importer, and eagerly watched it.  It is just now being shown in American theatres.  This film is a complex mystery, that goes back and forth in time, in an attempt to solve a brutal rape/murder that happened many years previously.  The protagonist (Darin, in another finely nuanced acting portrayal), is a retired court investigator, who is writing a book about the case.  He contacts his former boss, in order to gain information and insight.  This contact renews old feelings of love that he has for her.  The female lead is well portrayed by Soledad Villamil, and his dipsomaniac friend is wonderfully portrayed by Guillermo Francella.

4079467,5,B0036TGSJE,"""The Secret in Their Eyes"", which won the Oscar in 2010 for best foreign film, is a terrific movie, a thriller with great acting, cinematography, a very touching love story, and a brilliantly plotted mystery investigated in procedural style. It has many surprises and gripping suspense. It is well-told with all sorts of twists and turns that will keep you guessing right up until the end.
 Benjamin (Ricardo Darin) a court investigator, now retired, is writing a novel about a case of rape-murder that haunted him for many years. The movie is told in a series of flashbacks, and at times the scenes are gauzy as if recreated from lost memories.
A young recently married woman was brutally assaulted and killed. The murder devastated her young husband and turned his whole life into a quest for justice. Benjamin worked for a beautiful judge Irene (Soledad Villamil). He loved her very deeply, but he could not express his love to her.
It takes place in Argentina, and is in Spanish with English subtitles. Justice in Argentina at that time was hit or miss, often with corruption involved, and a system in which prosecutors could often rig cases and get back at their rivals by reversing verdicts. In this story a turf battle turns deadly for Benjamin.
 It's a very powerful, intense, moving story, very novelistic, with many twists and turns in the investigation. Benjamin's assistant is an absent-minded drunk named Pablo (in a brilliant performance by Guillermo Francella), and their scenes together are often very comic and rich in character development. At one crucial moment the boozy Pablo gets an inspiration; everyone has a passion, his is drinking, but he discovers through letters that he and Benjamin have stolen, what the killer's passion is.
 The scenes between Irene and Benjamin are heartbreaking because we know how much they love each other. The way she gets the killer to confess is a masterful scene in the movie.
If your passion is for richly told, creatively photographed, impeccably acted, and inspired moviemaking, then this is the film for you.",1274400000,2,2069,4.973988439306359

What to say of the regally beautiful Soledad Villamil who plays court secretary Irene Menndez Hastings?  I'm looking at her IMDB database and I see she's scandalously underused.  In a perfect world, directors would be clawing their way to this woman to beg that she act in their film.  What drives this movie's narrative is the long-term (25-year+) unrequited love and admiration between these two leading characters that sits right beneath the surface.  Best scene in the film: a spontaneous good cop (Darn), bad cop (Villamil) routine that the two undertake in the interrogation of murder suspect Isidoro Gmez (an outstanding turn of creepiness and malevolence by Javier Godino).  Villamil's character walked into the room under completely different pretenses, but - having been chilled by Gmez's penetrating, roving eye - she injects herself indelibly into the questioning. Her reaction and turn - and Darn's slow but sure understanding of her intent - is acting at its finest.  It's the movie's pivotal scene done extraordinarily well.

A third fantastic performance rounds out the trio of leads: Guillermo Francella, almost unrecognizable from his bouncy, chipper performance as sports agent Batuta in the raucous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rudo-Y-Cursi-Blu-ray/dp/B001UV4XCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rudo Y Cursi [Blu-ray</a>] (I loved that role - he was superb), is an alcoholic co-worker who is endured, carried and cared after by a good-hearted Esposito.  Despite problems with drink, Francella's Pablo Sandoval does get up for the thrill of the chase and proves instrumental in tracking down Gmez.

Some other 'stars' of the film:  the mellifluous Argentinean Spanish never sounded so good as it does here (especially leaving Ms. Villamil lips); the courthouse buildings in Buenos Aires are majestic and imposing;  the makeup artists deserve a special shout-out - the characters appear in two story arcs 25 years apart.

What to say of the regally beautiful Soledad Villamil who plays court secretary Irene Menndez Hastings?  I'm looking at her IMDB database and I see she's scandalously underused.  In a perfect world, directors would be clawing their way to this woman to beg that she act in their film.  What drives this movie's narrative is the long-term (25-year+) unrequited love and admiration between these two leading characters that sits right beneath the surface.  Best scene in the film: a spontaneous good cop (Darn), bad cop (Villamil) routine that the two undertake in the interrogation of murder suspect Isidoro Gmez (an outstanding turn of creepiness and malevolence by Javier Godino).  Villamil's character walked into the room under completely different pretenses, but - having been chilled by Gmez's penetrating, roving eye - she injects herself indelibly into the questioning. Her reaction and turn - and Darn's slow but sure understanding of her intent - is acting at its finest.  It's the movie's pivotal scene done extraordinarily well.

A third fantastic performance rounds out the trio of leads: Guillermo Francella, almost unrecognizable from his bouncy, chipper performance as sports agent Batuta in the raucous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rudo-Y-Cursi-Blu-ray/dp/B001UV4XCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rudo Y Cursi [Blu-ray</a>] (I loved that role - he was superb), is an alcoholic co-worker who is endured, carried and cared after by a good-hearted Esposito.  Despite problems with drink, Francella's Pablo Sandoval does get up for the thrill of the chase and proves instrumental in tracking down Gmez.

Some other 'stars' of the film:  the mellifluous Argentinean Spanish never sounded so good as it does here (especially leaving Ms. Villamil lips); the courthouse buildings in Buenos Aires are majestic and imposing;  the makeup artists deserve a special shout-out - the characters appear in two story arcs 25 years apart.  The make-up is perfect: you believe the aging process has taken place without any suspension of belief.",1273795200,5,3329,6.193478260869565
4079470,5,B0036TGSJE,"I found ""El Secreto de Sus Ojos"" to be well deserving of its Academy Award win for Best Foreign Film.

8390182,5,B0036TGSJE,"This original film in Spanish is much, much better than the watered-down US remake. It took the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 2009 and has since been voted one of the 100 greatest motion pictures since 2000. It is a powerful drama about a 25-year attempt to bring to a killer to justice. The killer had confessed the crime, was convicted and sentenced to prison only to reappear shortly as a member of the security detail for then-president of Argentina, Mara Estela Martnez de Perna, protected under that right-wing government. The film is well cast and extremely well-acted with a surprise ending few viewers will anticipate. I highly recommend it.",1516147200,2,660,4.901785714285714
