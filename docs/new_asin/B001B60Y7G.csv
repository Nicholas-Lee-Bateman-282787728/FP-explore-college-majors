While there are no big named actors in the film, several of them have gone on to work on other projects and they are all very talented. A great movie for those who love the historical fiction genre.",1283644800,,258,4.51063829787234
8281960,4,B001B60Y7G,"I recently purchased this movie, after looking for it for several years under the name ""The Magic Stone"". I was pleased by its quick arrival and even more pleased with the content. The movie was very good with a nice twist on America's discovery. Although I didn't recognize any of the main actors I thought it was well done and very realistic to the period. It was a less violent ""Pathfinder"" with good action and well developed characters. Although not rated I would give it a PG13. It was well worth the long wait. I'm glad I found it at Amazon and was pleased with its delivery and packaging. Thank you.",1266796800,,607,4.4774774774774775
