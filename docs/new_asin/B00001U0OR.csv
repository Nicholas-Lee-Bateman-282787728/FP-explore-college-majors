1246316,1,B00001U0OR,"I wish I could give this disc a 0 star because that's how bad this disc is. The quality overall is horrible, sound is very distored and the video is fuzzy through the whole thing. Not only that but its incredible dull and  boring, the interviews are really drab and reveal nothing new or even  remotely interesting about the Fab Four. And the commentator needs to do  research on them before he even speaks about them again, he was so  inaccurate that I totally died in laughter at times because of his  stupidity. Advoid this disc and get something that really show's who the  Fab Four are really - like Help! :-)",964224000,24,614,4.4375
1246317,1,B00001U0OR,"While no one can fault Giuliano for his research on the Beatles, this one should have remained in the dark!  He has absolutely NO sense of production and the crew he assembled to shoot and edit this mess doesn't seem to have  a clue on any level! When you hear someone talking about Yoko Ono, you see  footage of Paul.. and that sort of ""presentation"" runs through  the entire DVD!
Sound levels are awful and Giuliano brings absolutely  nothing to the screen when he wanders around Liverpool, pontificating ad  nauseum.
About the ONLY redeeming element in this mess is the segment of  Pete Best.. and even that is obviously shot on home video and bumped down  several generations at that.
Wait for the Beatles Anthology on DVD --  THAT will be worth the wait and the money!",958348800,18,773,4.583941605839416
1246318,1,B00001U0OR,Garbage-- don't waste your money on this one lads.  The only yucks out of this video were those provided by the narrator's phony British accent.  Might I recommend Yellow Sub if your in the mood for a little of the Fab  Four.,945129600,35,225,4.309523809523809
1246329,1,B00001U0OR,"Well, that was terrible.

I'll watch pretty much anything that has to do with the Beatles, and I was psyched when I got this for two dollars in a bargain bin, but now I know why. It's bloody awful.

I watched the first ten minutes, then skipped ahead looking for good parts until I ran out of film. The narrator is cheesy and has no idea what hes talking about, and the footage is underwhelming.

I never thought Id say this, but that was a waste of two-fifty. And ten minutes.",1108598400,6,477,4.21978021978022
1246330,1,B00001U0OR,"My favorite moment in this DVD is near the end, when Giuliano does a voiceover, lamenting the proliferation of cheap knock-offs and other products meant to exploit the memory of the Fab 4. He should have added the phrase, ""including the piece of crap you're watching right now.""
A couple of notable tidbits: Danish TV interview with John and Yoko around the time of their wedding; The entire interview with Paul conducted the day after John's death -- source of the infamous ""It's a drag"" quotation. Those I hadn't seen before.
Naturally, no Beatles music. Not even any Beatles-like music, with the exception of some sitar noodling.
The current-day footage is poorly shot, poorly edited, and looks like a junior high school video production.  I had to watch a couple of episodes of the Beatles Anthology to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
I paid $6.99 at Tower for this. However, I'm much more upset about the hour of my life I'll never get back.  Beware.",1089158400,10,958,4.696428571428571
1246331,2,B00001U0OR,I expected this DVD to be packed with Beatles songs and a history of the Beatles. Instead it walks through each of thier lives while they were Beatles explaining what it was they did. A bad DVD. The only good stuff is a few comments and some footage in the movie and the Additional footage they had of the Beatles coming home to the UK from the US. DO NOT rent this DVD it is a waste of your rental spot no matter if you get 3 or 8 DVD's at a time. It also came from San Jose which means that people like me in Minneapolis and people East of Minneapolis will have to wait a while for this movie that is not worth it. Skip this rental.,1052611200,4,634,3.9224806201550386
1246332,1,B00001U0OR,"Paraphrasing a line George Harrison spoke in ""A Hard Day's Night"":  The author of this DVD is a ""drag, a well-known drag...""
Laserlight, the distributor of this DVD, handles cheap-o, marginal programs, at budget prices.  But this is a new low, even for them.  To saddle up with infamous Beatle-leech, Geoffrey Guiliano (the Jerry Springer of Beatles ""experts""), and distibute his childish and smarmy ""Celebration"" is below even their standards.
Even for the price shown, this is a complete waste of money.  There is absolutely nothing of value, interest or entertainment on this DVD.  Purchasing it will only cause Guiliano to do this again.

1246333,1,B00001U0OR,"As an inveterate, long term Beatles fan, it was only natural that I would want to view this video.  Needless to say, I was highly displeased with the quality (or lack thereof) and Mr. Guiliano's long established career of smearing the Beatles.  Mr. Guiliano is not well loved among the Beatle literati and this video will certainly help explain the reason for this.

The interviews are lackluster; the filming quality is poor.  Take the advise of all the other reviews and skip this one.  Watch the Beatles First U.S. Visit, a Beatles' film or any other Beatles' related video instead.",1017100800,23,585,4.81
1246334,1,B00001U0OR,"Beatles-Celebration?  There is nothing further from the truth with this DVD.  Let me first of all say Im a huge Beatles fan and this DVD looks like it was made in someone's garage.  Literally.  The host is so obsessed with them (even wearing the Nehru jackets and following the ISKCON/Hindu guru ideals...coincedence?)that it becomes scary.  You almost feel like you are watching a home video tribute..done by a stalker.  The DVD shows very poor quality interviews.  Yes, I mean ""look ma, Im on home video"" quality.  Horrific.  In fact, I don't even think that the DVD even uses Beatles music at all.  Kinda ironic when you call the DVD a CELEBRATION and it's regarding a MUSIC group.  Stay far away.  Stay very far away.  I quickly wrapped this package up after one horrible viewing and returned it.  Learn from my mistake.  Please.",1012521600,8,833,4.767605633802817
1246335,2,B00001U0OR,"I have to tell you - if this movie wasn't talking about such great band as The Beatles, I wouldn't say you should buy it. Even so, this item, I think, is only for collectors. I must admit: that's not a good movie, not a bad one, but not something you should keep.
Bottom line, I advice you to buy it only if you're a Beatles fan, like myself. If not, good for you to choose something else.",1008979200,3,389,4.0
1246336,1,B00001U0OR,"Luckily, I wasn't the unfortunate buyer in this case, but I feel bad for my friend who thought she was buying me a nifty Christmas present... The blurbs on the packaging promises a great documentary along the lines of The Compleat Beatles, and even during the initial scenes it's still easy to hold out hope for something good, but slowly but surely the realization sinks in that this documentary is all about stirring up anticipation without ever giving a payoff. One major strike against this film is that it contains no Beatles music, and the only exclusive interviews are with bit-players connected to the Beatles. The rest of the film consists of boring location shots overlaid with meaningless commentary interspersed with equally dull footage of random press conferences with solo Beatles... Geoffrey Guiliano has achieved what I would have thought impossible, in creating a boring film about the Beatles",995500800,16,911,5.120805369127517
1246337,1,B00001U0OR,This was a joke! The worse piece of work done on the Beatles that I have ever seen. If only my hand hitting the T.V. screen would actually of hit the annoying guy who created this load of garbage. Thank God I only paid a few dollars for it.,987552000,9,240,3.9183673469387754
1246338,2,B00001U0OR,"This documentary relies mostly on existing footage woven together in a somewhat coherent manner.  The short ""news conference"" with Pete Best is probably the highlight.  Relatively interesting to watch but nothing to get overly excited about.  The Anthology series may be overkill for a casual fan-but this dvd is too brief and generic!",982368000,4,335,5.283018867924528

7914772,1,B00001U0OR,"It's hard to believe that such an amateurish job (on all levels) could be published on DVD. There are many cheap DVDs about the Beatles, usually containing no Beatles music, but this one is by far the worse I've ever seen, and I'm a longtime Beatles fan. The only vaguely (I say vaguely) interesting things for die-hard Beatles fans here are a John Lennon press conference in Denmark and various press conferences or interviews with Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Pete Best. Nearly not any footage of the Beatles together during the 60's. Half of the ""documentary"" looks like a poorly made Powerpoint of Beatles photographs.
I pity anyone who bought this thinking they would get a real biography of the Beatles. And Mr. Giuliano's insistence to make us buy other lousy Beatles-related products he ""created"" is sickening.
Don't spend a cent on it, really.",1267920000,,859,4.931034482758621
7914773,4,B00001U0OR,"I have read several of Geoffrey Giuliano's books on the Beatles, and quite honestly, I loved them all.  It's not so much the information that I enjoy, it's the style.  I understand that much of his writing is inconsistent and sometimes flat out inaccurate, but it's no big deal to me, because as a long-time fan I know the truth and I find it interesting to hear someone else's perspective.

This film, the Beatles Celebration, contains many unique film clips that I have not seen in other documentaries.  There are interviews with Frederick Seaman, Eric Clapton, the Maharishi, and of course the Beatles themselves.  One chief complaint I have about many Beatles documentaries is that they fail to explain what the impact was, in other words what the Beatles meant to their generation.  Even Anthology, as exhaustive as it was, missed that mark by a mile.  This documentary nails it.

Also, many of the interviews included here, to my knowledge, cannot be found anywhere else.  There are interviews with Alan Williams and Pete Best, both of whom were a big part of the Beatles' early story but neither of whom were interviewed for Anthology nor many others.

I feel that, even though the narration drags a bit and the entire program lacks any music by the subject in question, the interviews and the interesting new perspective make this unique documentary worth a go.",1241481600,,1369,4.836909871244635
7914774,3,B00001U0OR,"Geoffrey Guiliano is a very boring person to listen to.  He talks with such monotony that I almost fell asleep.  There is no music in this DVD at all.  But there are some interesting interviews.

Frederick Seamen, a friend of John Lennon, was interviewed for this DVD.  There are interviews with Alan Williams, Pete Best, as well as with John, Paul and George.  There is information here that is not in the Anthology, which I like.  More importantly, there is an interview with the Maharishi, which is something I haven't seen in any other documentaries.

Interviews aside, there is little value here.  Just a boring Beatles ""expert"" talking about the Beatles.  A casual fan would not want this.  An extremely dedicated fan will be interested in the interviews on this DVD.",1179446400,,773,4.824427480916031

7914778,1,B00001U0OR,"Amazon needs to create a negative star rating for some items.

When you have a built-in market that will buy anything

about a subject like the Beatles it's hard to lose.

But this does in a big way.

It's sort of like a PowerPoint presentation of random Beatles-related things.

A voice over including snippets of what may be the Beatles' voices rambles on as

you see a slide show of such fascinating items as receipts, pages out of books

and magazine photos, taped to a wall. At least they could have varied the fades

from one picture to the other, or cropped out the tape holding the picture to a board when they shot it.

It's very mechanical and soul-less.

Basically this would have to improve to be bad.",1165104000,,713,4.457364341085271

Worse still, this DVD contains no Beatles music!  This should give you an insight to its lack of authorisation.  It comes across as a cheap as chips production which is probably why there is no music. The producer simply could not afford it. Don't be fooled by the label stating rare footage. It does not shown anything that has not been seen before.  Such utter garbage, and an offence to any Beatles fan.  It should be renamed to ""The Beatles Slandered by G. Giuliano"".

It is simply not entertaining and poorly made.  Some footage in general is bad quality.  This is truely amateur work.  I must say that some of the footage of the Beatles themselves is somewhat interesting.  However the movie as a whole is just boring!  The movie would be so much better if it included more footage of the band and more music.  Instead, it includes commentary from people who should not be on camera.  The dialoge is monotone, and some of it is repetitive or uninteresting.  It was a waste of my time and frankly of anyone else's as well.  This is coming from a long time Beatles fan.",1126137600,3,731,4.255474452554744
