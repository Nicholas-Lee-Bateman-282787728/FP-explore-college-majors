And like I mentioned:  Great gift to give a family!",1476576000,,290,4.415094339622642
8484479,5,B005S0TGA2,"I can't say enough great things about Like the Scriptures.  My children watch them every Sunday and their friends come over to watch too.  They are witty and fun and I love the songs.  The Jonah movie is a little silly and corny, but the kids love it.",1403481600,2,251,4.1875
8484480,1,B005S0TGA2,"If you love Liken as much as my family does, meaning you love the stories, music, and lessons they teach to your family, then you were probably excited for the release of Jonah and the Great Fish. It is one of our favorite stories in the bible and we had high hopes for it and that it would be a great movie to watch for the ages. Liken even made a kickstarter to raise money so that this movie could have great special effects. We have six Liken movies in our home library, ever since the arrival of Nephi and Laban in late 2003, we have enjoyed each new release. Imagine our surprise a while later when we were just looking around on Amazon and saw this movie as an on demand rental. We told some of our extended family that we were going to watch it together with them. The beginning was ok, be it a little weak. Then all this stuff about ""whose side are you on"" and junk like that came on. It wasn't even fun, it was dark, it was scary. It wasn't uplifting, it wasn't good, it was trash. The songs weren't catchy, they weren't fun, and they weren't heartwarming as many of the other ones are. It was the opposite.

The story of Jonah is very simple and easy to understand, somehow they messed the whole thing up. From talking whales with anxiety problems and weird crab ladies that sing annoying songs, this has it all. They gave the big fish that swallowed Jonah the name of Humphrey. They also added another character Chum, who is the most annoying fish girl human thing you will ever hear or see. The whole Humphrey and Chum story was so bad, it dragged on forever, and it was very poorly written and executed. I could go on and on and on about why watching this might make for the worst 84 minutes of your entire life. Or you might just laugh at the annoying backstories, the terrible songs, and the awful job they did at making this and enjoy making fun of this movie throughout you watching it.

The one thing that this movie has is David Osmond. He has a nice voice, although the songs he sang were complete trash, and he did an almost-decent job at playing his part in the super awful script. Our whole family and extended family that watched this agreed it was very weak and not even close to Liken's standard of quality.

I know that Liken can do better than this, but they have to really try and let the spirit help them know what they need to sing about and what needs to be shown in these movies. Then and only then can they ever make a movie as great as the other Likens, ever again. This movie doesn't come close, if someone told me this was from a knockoff spoof company that was made to make Liken movies look bad, I would believe them. If you want to watch a good movie about the story of Jonah, watch Jonah: A Veggietales Movie, now that is a classic.",1379808000,2,2774,4.24007561436673
8484481,4,B005S0TGA2,"My girls (ages 10,12, &14) love the Liken the Scriptures movies and they claim that this is their favorite. Beginning has a little West Side story feel to it. Overall, I'm glad I purchased it.",1376611200,2,192,4.514285714285714
8484482,1,B005S0TGA2,"I didn't read the review on the movie, if I had read it, I wouldn't have bought  it.  I wasn't to my expectations.",1362096000,,114,3.9130434782608696
8484483,1,B005S0TGA2,"I've seen other reviews on here that talk about how this movie had good music, but the thing is the music was so boring at times.  Sometimes I think the people that make these Liken movies literally think ""Okay we need an emotional song about walking...what should we do?"" and then they do this five minute song about that.  I'm not giving a specific example, but I think you see my point.  This movie is filled with these super random wannabe spiritual songs, and it just ends up being super boring.

Another horrible thing about this movie is they focus way too much on the big fish.  They make him out to be an actual character in the story, and they make up this really sappy story about how he finds a friend named Chum, and how Chum helps him escape from sharks.  The thing is Chum is just really annoying, and whenever they would cut to the scene with them after a while I just wanted to hang myself.  They also seem to make a big chunk of the story about these characters, and it is super uninteresting.  I think they tried to make it appeal to children, but I'm pretty sure that even my seven-year-old sister was bored while watching this.

They made this movie way too long as well.  It ended up being about an hour and twenty minutes, and a lot of it was superfluous singing or a superfluous side story.  It ended up being too long and too boring.  Don't waste your time on this.  And a note to Liken, PLEASE make better movies.  When you make them, please do not make it super long, and please do not put so many songs in it.  Focus on the story at hand, put a few little comedic things in it, a few songs, and then end it.",1340582400,2,1635,4.212218649517685
8484484,1,B005S0TGA2,"My family has every other liken video and they love them, but Jonah was a huge disappointment.  The whole Humphrey and chum was a major distraction to the real story.  I am considering this a mulligan for liken.  Tried way too hard to make it into a full length feature.",1324339200,3,270,4.36
8484485,4,B005S0TGA2,"I've seen the rest of the Liken shows and this one is definitely their slickest production to date. Great songs, great performances, fun story, and the special effects they worked hard on adding work very well with the set.

My only complaint is that, in making a tighter story, they strayed a bit from the way the story went in the bible (and I'm not talking about the sharks - I loved the sharks). In the bible, Jonah insists on being thrown overboard rather than being thrown over against his will. Also, this story takes out the 'sitting on a hill waiting for Ninevah to be destroyed and getting his fig tree cursed' part. I can understand how they may have felt the need to tighten the story up a bit but I've felt that the way Liken stuck to the scriptural account in past productions, even if it made for awkward story telling, was one of its strengths, so I was a bit disappointed. Hopefully they'll correct that in the future, because I really hope they continue to make more. They're a great set of videos.",1323561600,3,1016,4.433155080213904
8484486,5,B005S0TGA2,"I was able to see this movie up on the big screen and I'm thrilled to have it in my home. This is the best movie by Liken yet. The music is wonderful, and the humor and teaching moments are just right.

This is the kind of entertainment I want my daughter to grow up watching. And the good thing is, she already loves it too!",1321833600,2,325,3.9242424242424243
