7819411,4,6301978803,"This animated TV special from the early 70's presents two of Washington Irving's stories: The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and Rip Van Winkle. Both are enjoyable enough particularly if you remember watching this special as a kid. You'll have to pick up a used VHS copy though--it's currently out of print.

The Famous Classic Tales series of specials was created by Air Programs International (API) an Australian animation studio. They created a number of animated specials that aired on CBS ususally around holidays--this particular show dates from 1971. These shows are not as well known as Rankin Bass specials (or Hanna Barberra specials for that matter). Still, if you're nostalgic for 70's TV, you will enjoy this show as well as the others such as A Christmas Carol, Treasue Island, Robin Hood, Connecticut Yankee, Kidnapped, Prince and the Pauper, and a slew of others.

These API shows are hard to find. Most haven't been out on video since the late 1980's when MGM/UA released the entire series. However, five or six titles have recently shown up on DVD (by Delta Entertaiment). Robin Hood and Treasure Island are standouts.",1098144000,7,1129,5.0
