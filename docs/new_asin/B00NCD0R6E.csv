6639368,1,B00NCD0R6E,"I am very disappointed!!
While this DVD promises evidence it delivers nothing. It's a monolog of a guy called Harry Cooper with a few photos that have nothing to do with Hitler's escape. There is nothing investigative in this DVD. There is no structure and nothing really new that's factual. But at some point Cooper says that Japan was testing nuclear weapons and there is evidence that the Germans established secret bases on the moon in 1964.",1433808000,5,445,4.792207792207792

Many Puzzles Explained and More Questions Raised

Michael IVINHEIM's/Harry COOPER of SHARKHUNTERS.com's book is a marvel of revelation about what most of us have never learned of world history of the 20th Century, and explains, between the lines, the inside nature of world political process in our present 21st Century, a process of morally-unjustifiable wars-for-profit seemingly instigated by giant trans-national corporations, the deaths and displacement of millions of people and their exodus into countries economically unprepared to receive them and ethnically surprised at their unwillingness to integrate themselves into their receiving societies, the fragmentation of a world into an incoherently shattered  jigsaw-puzzle of competing factions facilitating armed conflicts worldwide, and only really enhancing wealth accrual by the few, for the few, of the few, as the majority of the world sinks into individual poverty and becomes ruled over by an ever-tightening police-state noose upon us all.  Taking us back in history, as IVINHEIM does, just showing us some of the behind-the-scenes machinations of the major powers during 20th Century,, helps us better understand our world today.  On Page 80, he suddenly throws us a spin-ball with the story of VIKING colonisation in South America ; of lost underground facilities still protected by unknown structural materials that defied even world-leading German mining, boring and blasting technologies of the mid-20th Century, and the question arises : what happened to the Vikings, did they return to their homeland, and if so, why ? -- or did they go off somewhere with the unknown higher-tech builders of these protective facilities, leaving their valuables behind in safe places ? --  and why is this still-hidden knowledge under such a veil of secrecy, even today ?  With these questions, we perhaps begin to get an inkling of why certain world elites are competing in their rush to uncover artifacts and higher technologies of the past, secrets perhaps needed for their very survival -- but not necessarily for ours.  This book, taken together with Harry COOPER's/DON ANGEL ALCAZAR DE VELASCO's book, Hitler in Argentina, in which DON ANGEL quite off-the-cuff, mentions in passing some of the principal Third Reich post-War escapees to South America, begs the questions of, firstly, Who Profits ? and, secondly, whether or not wars, especially world-wars, are not perhaps tragic but orchestrated plays set up by world-elites for development of needed technologies that will benefit, in the first instance, only themselves ? If this sounds paranoid, never forget the dictum of the Principia Discordia, : EVERY BOOK IS A MIRROR, WHEN A MONKEY LOOKS IN, NO PHILOSOPHER LOOKS OUT.

Gar Vieles, was wir offiziell nicht wissen sollten

Michael IVINHEIM und Redakteur Harry COOPER von SHARKHUNTERS bieten uns ein Wunderbares Beispiel an von dem, was die Welteliten uns vorbehalten mchten.  Das Buch kam mir vorerst wie eine etwas trockenere Aufzhlung zahlreicher geheimer deutscher Aktivitten vor und whrend beider letzterer Weltkriegen vor, nderte sich jedoch schlagartig fr ein paar Seiten ab Seite 80 mit der fast nebenlufigen Erzhlung deutscher Entdeckungen mitten im 2. WK zu PARAGUAY, mit Resten einer verschollenen WIKINGERKULTUR, deren unterirdischer Sttten Zugangsschutz sogar deutschen Technologien jener Zeit, inklusive Bohr- und Sprengtechniken mit hchstbrisanten Sprengstoffen, sich gefeit zeigte (!) ; fazit : mit welchen noch hheren Technologien als den in den 40-er Jahrenden deutsch-Fhrenden wurden diese Anlagen gabaut, und, da die Wikinger nach vollen 290 Jahren Anwesenheit vor Ort scheinbar verschwanden, aber vermutlich nicht ganz vollstndig heimgekehrt waren, denn das htte eine Art Flucht bedeutet, wohin und/oder wie und mit wem sind sie in u. U. engerem Bndnis, freiwillig oder unfreiwillig, dieser Welt entflohen ?  IVINHEIMS Buch, zusammengenommen mit dem SHARKHUNTERS Buch ""HITLER IN ARGENTINA"" von Harry COOPER, mit Kernbuch die Kriegsendenaufzeichnungen von DON ANGEL ALCAZAR DE VELASCO, einem spanischen Agenten der deutschen ABWEHR unter Admiral Wilhelm CANARIS, klrt uns auf, wie fhrende Nazis dem kollabierenden Reich enflohen seien.  Erstaulichst, aber, sind  DON ANGELS fast beilufig angefhrten Schlussbemerkungen zur Herkunft fhrender Reichsberlebender, die quasi mit der Reichskasse und dazu noch sozusagen dem Silberbesteck hchster Technologien nachweislich getrmt waren und uns gesamtheitlich zwischen den Zeilen  eine hchst behunruhigende wie auch ohne Zweifel begrndete Fragestellung aufwerfen, ob eventuell das gesamte 3. Reichsgeschehen schlussendlich nicht eine massive Verarschung eines gesamten (deutschen) Volkes darstellt, das von einer (hheren ?) oder sonstigen (?) Weltelite eingespannt wurde, die Drecksarbeiten zu den bentigten hheren Technologieentwicklungen zu vollziehen, die irgendeine Weltelite irgendwann vermutlich bentigen wrde, einer dem Tode geweihten Planeten zu entfliehen, die ergatterten Technologien aber alleine zugunsten der genannten Anfhrer des dazu zu fhrenden Weltenkriegselendes zu entwickeln ? -- Technologien, die uns normal-sterblichen auf keinen Fall je zu nutzen kommen wrden.  Das
Buch  eigentlich beide zusammenhngenden Bcher ! -- sind meineserachtens ganz extrem zu empfehlen -- und mit dem soebengenannten zweiten Buch zusammengenommen, geben fast endlos nachzudenken auf.",1427155200,2,5447,5.848675914249685
6639373,1,B00NCD0R6E,"I rented this from Amazon and it is basically and interview with the president of sharkhunters.com, a group with interest in WWII German U-boat operations.  While it sounds like there is research to back up his assertions it feels more like an infomercial for a book that was written.  The case that was made was not compelling to me and the interview format was rather boring.  It would have been much more persuasive if they had done interviews and shown some actual footage to back up the assertions.  To me this seems like an opinion piece and should be noted as such.",1426377600,4,572,4.578431372549019

8677385,3,B00NCD0R6E,"Definitely more interesting than the DVD Grey Wolf: Hitler's Escape to Argentina, but ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF. Most of the film says ""you want proof, buy my book"". The author is a convincing sounding guy, but we just never get to any proof. I'm a big believer in many conspiracy theories, this one just doesn't cut it. I'm just not convinced that innocent body doubly were smuggled into the bunker & murdered. It could have happened, but no evidence. Bormann's DNA faked by the German government? Again, it may be true, but let's see a little evidence. I'd love to believe this, but i'm unconvinced. Maybe the book is better? Maybe i'll believe once I read the book, but why not put just a little proof in the DVD?",1479427200,3,710,4.5546875

8677387,1,B00NCD0R6E,"I was very excited to watch this ""documentary"" as I am a WWII historian and my grandfather fled Spain during the Spanish revolution. Particularly from NW Spain which was a temporary safe haven for escaping Reich officials. The video was basically an infomercial for a book by Sharkhunters President Harry Cooper. Horrible and repetitive background music, very few <10% video, the rest is the same talking head of Mr. Cooper. It is sad that such a low budget production was put out there, and even more sad that I purchased it. The same information, professionally told an captivating is currently being aired by the History Channel in ""Hunting Hitler"".
