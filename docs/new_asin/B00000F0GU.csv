1207941,3,B00000F0GU,"No, this isn't the old Fess Parker television series, but rather a fairly standard frontier adventure programmer from Republic Pictures that was made in the mid-1950s.  There's a reasonable amount of action, drama, and even some song, as Daniel Boone and his followers attempt to make a new life for themselves in the wilderness at Boonesboro.
There are no ""name"" stars here, save minor ex-Tarzan Bruce Bennett (former Olympic shot-putter Herman Brix), Lon Chaney, Jr., and country music star Faron Young, who does get a chance to belt one out.  Bennett was in his mid 40s when he made this film and, indeed, looks the part of a father with grown children.  The performances of the actors reflect the film's ""B-movie"" status . . . capable enough for the material, though I find the perpetually grinning Freddy Fernandez (portraying Boone's son Israel) to be annoying.  In the middle of the climatic battle, there's Fernandez grinning away like an idiot (I wonder what ever happened to him?).  All in all, though, this is a fairly watchable film that's helped by its short running time (approximately 75 minutes).
I have mixed feelings about this DVD transfer.  I'm sure at the time of its initial release, ""Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer"" was probably a very good looking film.  However, the print that Brentwood Communications has used has washed out colors and is ""soft"" looking, but the audio is fine.  This is the type of film that probably could only be released on DVD through an independent budget video company; it's highly unlikely that any major studio would release this film on DVD.  So, in that repect, viewers looking for older, hard-to-find films on DVD should probably be thankful to the independent video companies for searching out and releasing films like ""Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer.""",998265600,18,1800,4.973333333333334

1208086,3,B00000F0GU,"Bruce Bennett was the only actor Edgar Rice Burroughs requested to play Tarzan.  The one Tarzan movie/serial he made flopped.  Bennett redeemed himself in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre with a great performance in a true classic.  Lon Chaney Jr is best known for his performance as the Wolfman.  Here he one ups the role as an Indian Chief.  His close ups are priceless.  The American flag flying over the fort (in 1775) best attests to the level of thought put into this film.  The Indian attack on the fort (with the 1775 American flag) reminds me of when we dressed up as kids and played Cowboys and Indians, except here if you get killed you don't get up and continue fighting.  But nothing in the history of comedy beats the one of a kind ending involving Boone's arm, two sets of eyes, a dead Indian, and the Wolfman (I mean Indian Chief).  I would have added two more stars if Laurel and Hardy were in the film. This must be the film that set off Marlon Brando against Hollywood's portrayal of Native Americans.  It may not be How the West Was Won, but it's certainly good camp.",1443312000,,1087,4.417085427135678

1208359,3,B00000F0GU,"Daniel Boone Trail Blazer, 1956 film

This Trucolor movie begins with scenes of trees in a forest. Men signal with a whistle. They make camp for the night. [The shadows say it is noon time.] Indians lurk in the bushes. The British offer a rifle for every scalp! More for Boone's. Indian warriors attack the men sleeping [in daylight]. One man escapes from the ambush at Walden Creek. Boone will return to find his dead son. A Pennsylvania company invested money to settle these lands. They need men and supplies for protection. Boonesboro will become a large settlement in the west. Faron Young sings about the future. There is a prayer meeting; a message arrives for a pow-wow with Chief Blackfish. The Shawnee give a last warning: keep those immigrants out of their country. Simon Girty is now an ally of the Shawnee.

Four men leave with Daniel Boone to meet the wagons. They are in danger from Shawnee attack. Boone and the others will rescue them. Bird calls send a signal. A shot draws the Shawnee away. The captives escape, Daniel too. Will the British create an alliance between the Shawnee and the Cherokee? Boone goes to their camp, and is captured. ""White man lie."" Daniel must run a gauntlet to survive; he does. They talk of peace. Will Boonesboro be evacuated? The white men will cultivate the land to produce more food. Chief Blackfish will hold a parley. But there is a treacherous ambush of Blackfish's sons. Back at the fort Faron learns a lesson. ""But which one?"" Blackfish declares war, Daniel escapes, then rescues one son. Dirty Girty? White Fox must be saved. Can they survive a Shawnee attack?

The Shawnee stealthily invade the fort. The Squire shoots one. Did their luck just run out? Blackfish declares the peace is ended. One man runs away, the other sets off the black powder in the wagon. Luke will guard the ammunition in the fort, it is sparse. The Shawnee attack, ladders let them climb the walls. They keep on coming, like waves from the sea. Finally they fall back. The Squire runs out with a white flag; an easy target? Are they finished? [Did you see one of the dead men move?] The Shawnee approach the fort. The gate is open, Daniel speaks for White Fox, Blackfish plays along. Simon Girty shows fear. And so peace came to Boonesboro, the settlement of the West continued.

I remember little about Daniel Boone's exploits in settling Kentucky in the 18th century. What do you remember from school? This movie must be based on actual history, but changed and dramatized for entertainment. Never expect historical accuracy from Hollywood. The British ban on settlements west of the Colonies was one of the grievances in the Declaration of Independence. The Yankees could develop the wilderness that was untamed, even by the French who claimed the lands along the Mississippi from Louisiana to Quebec.",1279670400,,2836,4.781632653061225

This is superior to many other titles available for $1.00 and is good entertainment for the entire family, especially young children, as there are songs sung by children.

It is both good and bad that you can buy this for one dollar. Obviously, it is great for the consumer but it just shows how fast the retail price has declined for DVDs and in turn that makes the business increasingly difficult for producers and distributors.

Republic Pictures was nearing the end of its career releasing B pictures mostly westerns, crime stories and those Bowery Boys pics when this one came around. Released in a process called TruColor, the films colors haven't aged well (at least in this transfer). But it doesn't detract that much from this fast moving story starring Bruce Bennett (Herman Brix, I gotta research and find out why he changed his name) as the namesake of the picture and Lon Chaney, Jr. as the Indian chief whom Daniel must eventually make peace with.
It's a story filled with fights, morality, romance and even song from country crooner Faron Young. Released in 1956, I'm sure to capitalize on the Davy Crockett craze at the time, this low budget story of building the new frontier is fine for the family with some mild violence and at 76 minutes is perfect viewing for a rainy day.
Brentwood/BCI put in their usual extras, six chapter stops, a DVD dictionary, trivia game and a short subject (Hal Roach's ""Little Rascals""). This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called ""The Wild West"" and is available from Amazon.com.",1079481600,9,1267,4.737556561085973
