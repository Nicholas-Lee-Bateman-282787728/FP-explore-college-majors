3829022,5,B001XURPH2,This is a very interesting movie.  I would watch it again and again from time to time.  I haven't seen this much footage on Everest until this movie. If you love Everest stories then this is a must watch.,1440460800,,204,4.205128205128205
3829023,5,B001XURPH2,"Interesting. Having watched Everest Behond the Limit, I had believed that The climbers passed the dying man David Sharp on the way down from the summit and not on the way up. This movie changed my whole opinion of that matter. I do understand that little can be done near the summit of Everest to get them down and that these people pay thousands of non-refundable dollars to Russell Brice to get to the summit and it really doesn't seem fair that an unprepared solo climber who runs into trouble should be the cause of them not making it, but don't lie about what really happened.",1437177600,2,581,4.490566037735849

3829025,4,B001XURPH2,"Amazing documentary on an utterly fascinating subject. I've always found that idea of climbing Everest is one of those ideas that sound great on paper as bucket listers, but not something I personally truly find to be any kind of life goal in that regard. Of course, those who actually tackle Everest have to put in the time and money and effort that weeds about people like me from actually getting on the mountain. Still, there are those who choose this as a vital undertaking in their life, but who don't understand true mountaineering and the hazards of it all - and, most importantly - why they are really climbing Everest. This doco does a great job of exploring all aspects of this issue and the consequences of ego, poor preparation, motivations, and other fascinating dynamics. And, all the while, it tells a compelling story that is - critically - composed of actual video and audio from this disasterous expediton. I've been skydiving a couple of times, and that's enough for me. The idea of climbing Everest is one thing, but this film does a great job of showing what really goes into it and what happens when you might be undertaking this quest for the wrong reasons or with the wrong group of people.",1421280000,14,1215,4.655813953488372
3829026,5,B001XURPH2,"This is a must see documentary on Mount Everest for all those who are intrigued by this monstrous mountain.

The story is very gripping to see those mountaineering seeking to reach the summit .

It also has a story line that is quite noteworthy but sad but I suggest those that are interested do watch it.

It is a must see and watch show not too mention educational as well.

Be sure to watch it on a big screen.",1400544000,,413,4.189873417721519
3829027,5,B001XURPH2,"I've never been to the Himalayas, but for some reason I'm able to ""get"" what it is about them in general, and Everest in particular, that draws people to them like a magnet.  I wish I'd known about this community of nut jobs decades ago when I was young enough to have at least visited base camp or something, even if I didn't have what it takes to climb.  Oddly, these stories of loss and tragedy somehow just add to the allure.  An excellent read.",1395532800,,449,4.258823529411765
3829028,5,B001XURPH2,This is an excellent documentary showing many themes and perspectives on climbing Mt. Everest. This film is very thought provoking and honest.,1362182400,,142,5.5
3829029,3,B001XURPH2,"Definitely worth watching if you are an Everest nut. :) I always wish there was more footage, and more information, but that's my problem. :) Overall, I'm glad we watched it.",1348358400,2,174,4.645161290322581
3829030,4,B001XURPH2,I have seen this documentary a couple times for free online and I liked it enough to order it.  It's well shot and the interviews are good.,1335657600,,139,4.148148148148148
3829051,2,B001XURPH2,"I like climbing movies; I admire many mountaineers, but this film was incredibly boring and when I gave that some thought I realized it's because this particular team (and probably all thirty of the other climbers on the mountain that day attempting the summit) were somehow able to ignore a fellow climber whom they might have been able to help. Their selfishness made the film boring to me; strange, but true. They all seemed cold-blooded, ambitious, unimaginative and egocentric -- and dishonest. IF any of them had radioed the leader about the dying man in the cave, the leader had no record of it -- but he also seemed as self-centered as the men who'd paid him $50k each to take them up there. The dying man, however, seems to have been a true mountaineer more than a consumer of mountains. Boring film about icky people. I ended up feeling sorry for Qomolangma -- and not for the first time.",1465948800,4,898,4.61875

3829056,3,B001XURPH2,"In other documentaries, I've heard about the bodies that are still on Everest, but I found this one particularly disturbing. It's hard to understand how these climbers could just walk past someone who was alive and in trouble. I do understand that when you're there it's sort of every person for themselves, but I've heard of other climbers who have been rescued, and of climbers who have helped someone in trouble. Anatoli Boukreev put himself at risk when he saved three other climbers during the disastrous 1996 Everett expedition. So, it's troubling that none of these climbers did anything to assist. And, all the conflicting stories and justifications they give present an unpleasant picture of the group. Only one of them seemed genuinely conflicted about the decision, but in the end he had to go along with the others, or I suppose they would have left him behind, too. When in the pursuit of reaching the summit climbers lose their humanity, it seems a hollow achievement.",1455321600,8,982,4.921686746987952
3829057,5,B001XURPH2,"Loved this documentary about one of the expeditions on the north side of Everest in 2006. It centers on the controversy surrounding David Sharp, who climbed Everest alone, late in the day, on one of the coldest days on the mountain. He ended up spending the cold, cold night high on the mountain. In the early hours of the following morning, as David Sharp sat dying beside the trail, thirty climbers passed him as they headed for the summit. They passed the stricken man again as they descended. As the public learned of his death, a firestorm of criticism landed on, of all people, Mark Ingalls, a double amputee who was climbing that day. This film is exciting, tragic; the footage is great, as are the interviews with Ingalls and the rest of his expedition. There are two amazing books about the fateful 2006 Everest Season -- Dark Summit and High Crimes. This film is a great complement to those books.",1455148800,7,907,4.6397515527950315
3829058,5,B001XURPH2,Love watching shows that put you in the death zone and feel the pain of climbing the world's tallest mountain.,1454025600,,110,4.55
3829059,4,B001XURPH2,"Very difficult to watch. My questions to the climbers, can you live with the decisions that you made that day? Are there no protocols on what to do when a climber in trouble is found? Very unfortunate situation for all. If you could not stay and attempt a rescue, why is there no call for help documented when the troubled climber was first found? Seems very irresponsible, these low budget climbs, you are really out there on your own, very scary.",1451433600,,448,4.54320987654321
3829060,5,B001XURPH2,Really enjoyed this documentary. If you love mountain climbing movies like I do this one is a must see.,1449014400,,103,4.473684210526316

8347772,4,B001XURPH2,"Very disturbing read. Agree with other postures the story jumped around but that did not bother me. Story was interesting and brought up many ethical dilemmas. A sport one would think would require teamwork seems anything but at least in Everest. Makes you think twice about the ""achievement"" of ""conquering"" Everest.",1494979200,,317,5.235294117647059
8347773,1,B001XURPH2,Not worth any amount of money,1485302400,,29,4.0
8347774,2,B001XURPH2,"This is an ""okay"" Everest documentary. However, there are many more that are free on Amazon Fire Tv or on Netflix. Once you have watched all the free ones, it isn't worth paying for others...you will have seen it all and it just gets repetitive.",1484006400,,245,4.466666666666667
8347775,5,B001XURPH2,Wow!!!  I absolutely love these types of movies and this one is excellent.  You won't be disappointed.,1483747200,,102,4.9411764705882355

8347777,4,B001XURPH2,"Fascinating story.  And I actually understood where the climbers were coming from, even if I didn't necessarily agree with all of their decisions--until the last line of the movie.  There is a voiceover saying how Sir Edmund was correct to criticize their neglect of the dying climber, but his comments show how things have changed.  ""All of society has changed.""  Ah, so that's it.  Society has changed and you're just part of it!  Everybody's like this so why should I be any different? How juvenile, and how cowardly--just like their actions.",1468281600,,545,4.934065934065934
8347778,4,B001XURPH2,"What would I have done? That's the question I was asking myself as I watched this unflinching documentary about a team of climbers determined to summit Everest, even at the risk of their lives. Near the top they encounter, coming and going, a solo climber nearly comatose from frostbite. Should they have set aside their goal to try to help him?

The answer is not so simple as it might seem. But as we are given the pros and cons of either course of action, what I found most interesting was how individuals on the team, who were later excoriated publickly for their choice, attempted to shift the responsibility away from themselves. All seemed to be honorable guys, and I am suspicious of the motivations of armchair critics who attacked them in such an ad hominem way.

Basically they were, as the Brits say, up against it. There was no right choice. In the face of that, they had to do what was expedient.

Ironically, I think most viewers will understand their choice. But the blame-shifting leaves a bitter aftertaste. This is one conquest of Everest that would not have a happy ending. In fact, for these guys, the climb's ordeal might never be over.",1467504000,2,1158,4.639024390243902
8347779,4,B001XURPH2,"I thought  film this was a very provocative and insightful look at this Mountain & its climbers .Very different then the usual the tale of one persons or groups attempt of their climb, one I havnt seen before. I watched it twice actually. The fact that this is the actual footage from that climb in question makes it that much more engrossing. I understand What Sir Edmund was saying and actually agree with him in spirit. But i think his criticism was  wrong,misguided & aimed at the wrong person(s).Unless you where there on ""that"" night. How can you make that judgement ? His fate was sealed by not having 02 & his late accent even then who knows ? The man he blamed so randomly out of 34 had to be saved himself & would may have died had it not been for his climbing companions . I do feel Tex's pain & remorse however . Watch It",1467244800,3,833,4.265822784810126
