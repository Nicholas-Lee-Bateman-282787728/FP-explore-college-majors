8044911,5,B00076ON0K,"The great Paul Naschy stars as an aged actor who finds that opportunities for him are drying up. Widowed by the death of his wife, depressed by the death of his daughter, and cast aside by the theaters that used to woo him, he struggles to hold onto his self-esteem and,nearly broke, reluctantly accepts a job under contract to a small production studio.  From there, he gets sucked deeper into the depravity of the human mind until one day...

And that's where the movie really takes off.  Yes, there is nudity, gore, and a particularly brutal scene where a girl is bound Arms Over Head naked and beaten in front of cameras as a depiction of a snuff film, but the build-up to that scene, and what comes after, is what truly makes this film either (a) repulsive or (b) outstanding, depending on your interpretation of cinematic art.  Naschy fans will rejoice but the uninitiated will go ""What did I just see?"" and move on.

DVD clarity is good and the imagery is saturated with color.  Even though the language is Spanish and subtitled, if you like foreign films you should be used to this.",1440460800,,1090,4.564102564102564
8044912,4,B00076ON0K,"Nascy plays an over-the-hill and out of work actor whose days of fame are long behind. This leads him to signing a mysterious contract while not thoroughly reading the document and also finally snapping and embarking on a killing spree.

This is sometimes a talky, dialogue driven film that spends a lot of its time sometimes drifting from one dialogue scene to the next; however, I didn't think it was boring at all. During the first half hour, there's only some nudity with no full frontal scenes during a stage performance. It takes over a half hour for the body count to begin, but the directing is excellent. The acting is really good as well, so I didn't think the dialogue scenes are boring. Unlike Naschy's earlier classics, the effective atmosphere is completely gone in this film. This movie is also missing the great scenery of his earlier flicks, so it relies on solid performances and really good directing to keep you from being bored. Later on in the flick, there's some full nudity during a snuff film sequence. The body count is good, and I thought there was a decent amount of gore; although I would've preferred some more. In one sequence, Naschy acts as Jack the Ripper and cuts a woman in half, but it's done off-screen; although you do see the gruesome remains with the guts hanging out. Like the rest of the film, the violent scenes are well directed. Soundtracks are pretty good, and the film feels modern; mainstream horror fans may like. it It's a very well made film, but the numerous indoor sequences and the absence of Naschy's trademark atmosphere and scenery was kind of disappointing.

There's trailers, and image gallery, a directors interview and a making of the movie for extras. The quality is good, but it's disappointing that the widescreen isn't anamorphic.",1430956800,,1796,4.790322580645161

8044914,5,B00076ON0K,"Pablo Thevenet [Paul Naschy] was once a famous actor, but now he is forgotten and ridiculed. The only job he can get is playing a human statue outside the Club Pandora, bringing to life all the great murderers throughout the centuries. The pay is good, but the effect it is having on his mind is profound; his vengeful side comes to the forefront and he begins killing all those he believes wronged him in his career, killing them in the style of the character he is playing. And then there is the small matter of the contract he signed with Senor Reficul, a contract he did not wholly understand.

Rojo Sangre is a stylish, surreal telling of a Faustian tale. Lavish sets and surreal touches enhance the brilliant story line and outstanding performance of Paul Naschy. An clever, mesmerizing tale.",1298332800,2,798,4.7
8044915,5,B00076ON0K,"I grew up with Paul(Waldemar Daninsky)Naschy. When I was
a child he was always on the Monster Mash Saturday double chiller
He has played every famous monster from Frankenstein's to Dracula
the Mummy,Mr. Hyde,Hunchback,zombie and of course his most famous
Werewolf...I watch him in the most low budget films but when your 6
you don't care..You just want monsters and action and Paul never
dissapointed. Now he has done a film that is his MASTERPIECE!!!
I say that for it is a VERY well made film,great directing
acting and over a million dollar budget which is a first for
 EL HOMBRE LOBO! Naschy plays a out of work actor who
starred in what else? Horror movies! He will do anything
for work even KILL for it,I am not going into the story
you have to watch for your self but this GEM has everything
for a HORROR/GOREHOUND and then some! With it's Argento
like directing and moody feel you are in for a SHOCKING
good time. I am somewhat sad and shocked myself that I am
the first to review this???????????? This is not only a
great movie but Paul's best and everyone who loves Horror
should give a nod to EL Lobo. Paul Naschy and Christopher
Lee are all we have left of the great MONSTERS actors
please buy Rojo Sangre it is a MUST.
Thank you Paul for your contribution for over 35 yrs.
to my fav. Genre of film...HORROR and for my fav.
wolfman Waldimar Danisky also recommened Curse of the Devil!",1186963200,8,1396,4.474509803921569
