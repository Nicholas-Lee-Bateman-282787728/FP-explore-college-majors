We want to say the right things, and make sure our kids learn the right values at the same  time... but sometimes the questions throw off our timing!  The suggestions  in this video make it easy to reply in a way that will satisfy the kids,  and make you think later, ""Gee, I handled that well!"" I want to  be sure that my kids don't learn about sex and sexually related issues from  T.V. or from other kids -- or even from school alone.  It is really  important to have input in your kids values in this arena.  And this tape  really helps you to remain ""calm"" and give good answers.  I found  it useful for talking to my pre-school AND school-age kids.",947980800,8,784,4.1466666666666665
