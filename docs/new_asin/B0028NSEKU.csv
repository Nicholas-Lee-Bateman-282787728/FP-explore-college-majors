8596611,1,B0028NSEKU,"This is one of the most incompetent and downright pathetic attempts at filmmaking I've ever seen.  Obviously, I didn't expect much from a film written and directed by some dude calling himself Creep Creepersin, but I didn't expect to find such a complete and utter train wreck as this.  Most bad movies (and I've seen a lot of them) at least try to come up with something resembling a plot, but OC Babes and the Slasher of Zombietown fails to register the least tiny bit on that or any other cinematic meter.  This is as complete and utter a failure as any film you're likely to find.  I would rather watch a Manos marathon than subject myself to OC Babes and the Slasher of Zombietown again.

This film has a running time of around sixty-nine minutes.  The first ten consist of the opening credits, the most exciting few minutes of which feature a news report informing us that the dead are coming back to life and eating the living.  The film basically ends after fifty-seven minutes, leaving twelve minutes of closing credits and a lot of footage from the end of Night of the Living Dead - which comes as no surprise because almost half of the actual film itself consist of scenes from that same movie (which is, of course, in the public domain).  The rest of the time, a motley crew of so-called stereotypical Orange County characters assemble in a seedy bar and lock themselves in to keep the zombies out - only to discover that there's a crazed killer trapped inside the bar with them.  Don't expect any gory special effects because there aren't any - heck there aren't any babes, either, and the only zombies you see come from the numerous Night of the Living Dead clips the director kept inserting.

I don't have one good thing to say about this film.  The story doesn't make a lot of sense, the acting is perhaps the worst I've ever seen, the sound is awful (some of the dialogue is almost impossible to make out), there's no sign of anything remotely resembling cinematography, and the editing is - beyond any shadow of a doubt - the worst I have ever seen.  Someone needs to buy Creep Creepersin a dictionary so he can look up the word ""transition.""  The cuts in this film are so sharp and rough that you could actually cut yourself just by handling the DVD.  Believe me - no good can possibly come from subjecting yourself to this horrible film.",1301443200,4,2357,4.515294117647059
8596612,1,B0028NSEKU,"I wish I could take the time it took to watch this movie back. It was horrible.  It barely has a plot, the background music is enough to drive you crazy.  It has points cuts to old black and white zombie movies right to the very end of the credits. Spare yourself, don't watch this.",1251331200,3,282,4.109090909090909
