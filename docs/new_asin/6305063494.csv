965299,4,6305063494,"A classic Hammer chiller, THE WITCHES, which is also known as THE DEVIL'S OWN, is an engrossing story of the occult set in the seeemingly harmless English countryside.
Haunted by the terrors she saw in Africa, schoolteacher Gwen Mayfield (Joan Fontaine) accepts a teaching position in a local Haddaby School run by Alex Bax (Alec McCowan) and his sister Stephanie (Kay Walsh).
Soon, however, as mysterious occurances start, such as a boy falling into a coma, a headless doll found impaled with pins, Gwen starts re-living her African nightmare again.
Very good story, although the climactic witch-coven scene draws more laughs than gasps, with the Witch Queen looking like a cross between Edina from AB FAB and Bullwinkle the Moose.
In deluxe widescreen (aspect ratio of 1.66:1), and original trailers of the film under the DEVIL'S OWN title, and paired with another Hammer film PREHISTORIC WOMEN.",992390400,15,897,5.1506849315068495

What I will say though is that this is well acted, by a fine cast, equally well directed and most important of all its very well controlled. There is a subtle underlying sense of menace going on in this film, which it would be rare to see in a modern film. In fact but for the last 10 minutes, where the inevitable rituals and costumes see the light of day this would have got 5 stars from me. Only the ending lets it down.

It's hard, indeed, to understand why other Hammer fans ignore this entry, particularly since its script is far more literate than many of their other pictures from the same time frame. In any case, the Hammer production team does a wonderful job here of conveying the small village ambience and the screenplay follows Norah Loft's novel very closely. What makes this film so distinctive is its understatement--the horror when it emerges is all the more disquieting since everything seems so idyllic.

Miss Fontaine is superb. Note her scene near the beginning when she is questioned about her nervous breakdown during a job interview. She brings to the sequence and its halting tragic dialogue, the same reticent, diffident charm she displayed nearly 30 years earlier when she explained the death of her father to Olivier in ""Rebecca."" Eerily, these two scenes seem oddly connected despite the passage of time. What a pro she was!

965445,4,6305063494,"I enjoyed this immensely, although it tends to get panned even by Hammer horror fans. Once the daft opening was over, I found it suitably chilling. The trio of central performances - namely Joan Fontaine, Alec McCowen and Kay Walsh - are great, and it really benefits from Richard Rodney Bennett's typically expert score. It prefigures The Wicker Man in its tale of an outsider coming to a village wrapped up in occultic religion, and also has a hint of The Birds, which I'm sure can't be coincidental - Fontaine sports a hairstyle and costume strikingly similar to those of Tippi Hedren in some scenes!",1160265600,,603,4.752380952380952
965446,3,6305063494,"The Witches aka The Devil's Own is an interesting but ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Hammer to make a serious(ish) movie about witchcraft. Nigel Kneale's screenplay displays some of his customary intelligence, but here he seems hindered by working not from an original story but by adapting Norah Loft's novel. A deathly pale Joan Fontaine is the schoolteacher recovering from a nervous breakdown who takes a job in an outwardly idyllic English village only to gradually suspect that there are darker forces at work - although this could just be in her own imagination. Of course, we know that she's clearly bonkers after her horrible offscreen experience at the hands of witchdoctors in Africa (well, a soundstage in Bray) while the credits were running, but we also know that just because she's had one turn of the screw too many doesn't mean there aren't real witches at work...

It's good at the unpleasant undercurrents in ostensibly beautiful small country towns and also looks at the attraction witchcraft has for women of a certain age (it's a power thing, apparently, with magic as a substitute for waning sexual power). Unfortunately, it goes downhill pretty fast once the cat is, quite literally, out of the bag and the last reel orgy plays more like a bad amateur modern dance performance that goes on forever than a terrifying pagan ritual (the silly costume doesn't help, although it's probably the only 60s film to feature faecophiliacs at play if that's your thing).",1145750400,,1486,5.016194331983805

965448,3,6305063494,"In her last appearance on the silver screen, Joan Fontaine, who won an Academy Award for her performance in Suspicion (1941), stars in this Hammer Studios release of The Witches (1967).  While the material here is certainly not of the caliber of some of the previous films she's appeared in, it is fun to watch.  Maybe I have some lurid fascination of seeing once great stars reduced to appearing in roles they probably would have never considered in their prime.
Joan plays Gwen Mayfield, a teacher who has just been accepted to assume a position as head teacher of a private school in a small English village.  The film starts off with Gwen teaching at a mission school in Africa, and, after an incident with a native witch doctor that caused Gwen to have a nervous breakdown, she has now returned to England to put the pieces of her life back together.
After formally meeting with her employers, Alan and Stephanie Bax, played by Alec McCowen and Kay Walsh respectively, the well-to-do resident benefactors of the town who are also brother and sister, Gwen settles into her new surroundings.  The situation seems idyllic, a nice, quiet position in a small town where little happens, but, as the saying goes, still waters sometimes run deep.  The oddness begins when two of her pre-teen students, a boy and a very weird girl, exhibit closeness to each other, one borne of a budding romance.  This causes consternation among some of the townspeople, and soon the boy falls ill of a mysterious coma.  Apparently there was more than just a passing concern about what might happen if the relationship between these two continued, specifically in respect to the girl.
Rumors of witchery begin to reach Gwen, and the deeper she probes, the more ominous the proceedings.  As the notion of witchery becomes more and more viable, the idea that there may be more than one witch, a coven, operating within the town, involving various members of the small village.  Gwen soon finds herself at odds with unseen forces, and suffers a relapse, forcing her to be institutionalized.  She has also lost her memory of everything that's transpired after leaving Africa.  She does regain her memory, bits at a time, and the horror begins to return as she understands what is about to transpire, and rushes back to the town in an attempt to save the girl from an unknown fate, and ultimately learn that witchery is not limited to third world peoples but is alive and well here in this small, English village.
Joan Fontaine does a great job here, still exhibiting the sheen of a Hollywood star, even if some of that sheen has dulled since her prime.  I have to say, even pushing 50 she still looked pretty good, despite the oddish, bowl bouffant she sported through most of the film.  Fontaine's older sister, Olivia de Havilland, didn't fare as well, career wise, in my opinion, starring in dubious films like Lady in a Cage (1964), and Irwin Allen 70's disaster pics like Airport '77 (1977) and The Swarm (1978).  The creepy factor develops nicely as the film progresses, and as the mystery deepens about who's involved in the coven and what their purpose is, but this is soon replaced by a goofy factor as we see the coven in action, performing a ritual, half-nekkid dance of sorts in a decrepit, abandoned church, eating greasy dirt as their leader spouts incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo while clad in colorful robes and donning a crown with birthday candles adorning the top.  I kept waiting for someone to make a wish and blow out the candles, but the others were to busy bumping and grinding to their chanting, and, as I said before, masticating the mud.
Anchor Bay Entertainment releases a great print, in wide screen anamorphic format.  Special features include a theatrical trailer, television promotional spots and a World of Hammer episode titled Wicked Women.  Also included in the DVD case on the flipside of the card listing the chapter stops is a reproduction of promotional material used for the film.  I really find much enjoyment in these little touches, as it seems to indicate thought was actually put into the release, and a sense that one's getting their money's worth, even though this release seems a bit pricey.

I'd read about this movie years ago and have even caught snippets of it over the decades, but nothing prepared me for Anchor Bay's excellent DVD release! Crisp, clean, with deluxe packaging and interesting ""extras,"" The Witches is a quality product all the way. Ms. Fontaine--whose screen persona ranged from innocent and shy (see Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" and ""Suspicion"") to connivingly evil (""Born to Be Bad"")--gives a low-key and totally convincing performance as ""Gwen Mayfield,"" ex-missionionary teacher. Her new assignment, acting as headmistress to a private church school in quiet Heddaby (Cornish England) would seem to be an ideal move, considering her traumatic turn at the hands of African witchdoctors (shown in an exciting prologue).  But what's this? There are strange ""undercurrents"" in Heddaby! Drownings, headless voodoo dolls, a burned-out church, and ""the mangle!"" Could it be? Is there actually (gasp)witchcraft afoot?  Well, needless to say, with a movie called ""The Witches,"" you can draw your own conclusions!  It's interesting to see Fontaine at work--she lacks the bombast of, say, a Bette Davis or Joan Crawford. Instead, she handles her duties as Hammer horror heroine with great subtlety and panache.

7882918,4,6305063494,"I recently returned my viewings habits to some Hammer product I had never investigated and wound up paying more than $35.00 for a new copy of the Anchor Bay DVD which makes it the most expensive Hammer product I've purchased.  I really had to give myself a good talking to because I felt so guilty about expenses and had to pay so much to finally see Joan Fontaine in the league of other great ladies of the cinema doing roles for Hammer.  It was worth it, even though Fontaine is not the menace of the film, and I was happy for her to use her brains to effectively solve the mysteries she uncovered (or more sinisterly, had found her) and even gains a hint that what the evil witch had in mind for herself could very well easily still happen to an aging woman without conjuring the devil to get it.  There were reportedly disgruntled rumors about the star's experience with Hammer and director Cyril Frankel, but the film is well done with a literate script by Nigel Keale based on the novel ""The Devil's Own"" by Peter Curtis.  It boasts a good score by Richard Rodney Bennett (""Murder on the Orient Express"") and lovely photography by Arthur Grant and the director (""Never Take Candy from a Stranger"") does a very admirable job of keeping it all worthwhile.  Kay Walsh and Alec McGowen co-star.  The finale could have been creepier, but Fontaine and Keale's efforts to subdue it from outright camp are in evidence.  It turns out to be a blessing to have it on second viewing and has the elements that seem to allow it be enjoyed with multiple viewings.  The DVD is well done.with some extras like a documentary about Hammer's Evil Women, trailer, TV spots.

The Witches (1966) is one of the lesser known Hammer horror films, but it's a solid Hammer flick.  The acting is pretty good throughout.  Joan Fontaine carries this movie.  She looks really good in this movie, really good for being 48-49 years old at the time.  A quarter of a century after she appeared in two Hitchcock classics, Rebecca (1940) and Suspicion (1941), she still had it.  She's in almost every scene as well.  This is a very talky movie, lots of dialogue, but interesting nonetheless.  The ending of the movie is cool.  The music is pretty good as well.

Just as she is settling in, she discovers some troubling things afoot in the village - a young girl seems to be abused by her grandmother, a promising young man slips into a coma, and his father later turns up dead. In addition to all these unfortunate events, mysterious headless, pin-pricked dolls make their appearances around the village. Gwen's fragile state of mind also begins to conjure images of the voodoo dolls she saw in Africa. Is she losing her mind or is witchcraft still thriving in this English village?

There is a high level of atmosphere and suspense in this under appreciated Hammer movie, and it is also one of the most beautifully-filmed of the studio's productions. I loved the idyllic English country setting which contrasted well with the underlying menace and evil residing among the villagers. Fontaine's understated performance was well-done, but credit should also go to Kay Walsh who plays Stephanie Bax, the intellectual, spirited, and seeming ally. I admit I found the finale quite a spectacle, but if you can get past the cheesy extras and focus on the actual storytelling, this is well worth one's time, especially for fans of classic horror.",1347408000,2,2204,5.820433436532507

The only two things that give the film any credence is Joan Fontaine and that it is a Hammer production. Hammer cannot go wrong in many eyes. The butcher (Duncan Lamont) can be seen again in ""5 Million Miles to Earth"" (1967).

7882925,4,6305063494,"In spite of low budgets and quick shooting schedules, Hammer Horror was often able to attract major stars--and in this instance the star was Joan Fontaine (b. 1917), an Oscar winner for Alfred Hitchcock's SUSPICION and one of Hollywood's great leading ladies of the 1940s.  Fontaine continued to work in motion pictures through the 1950s and 1960s, but during this period she was best known as stage and television actress.  At some point in the 1960s she enountered the novel THE DEVIL'S OWN by Peter Curtis (a pen name for Norah Lofts) and was so intrigued by the material that she purchased the screen rights and took the project to Hammer Studios, where she also co-produced the film.  Released in 1966 and known in England as THE DEVIL'S OWN and in the United States as THE WITCHES, it would be her last appearance on the big screen; although her work slowed, she would continue on stage and screen until 1994, when she retired.

In some respects THE WITCHES follows in the footsteps of such films as 1957's NIGHT OF THE DEMON, 1960's VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED and 1961's THE INNOCENTS, and anticipates such later films as 1968's ROSEMARY'S BABY and television's 1978 THE DARK SECRET OF HARVEST HOME.  Each of these films created a commonplace setting--often in the countryside or small towns, but occasionally in the big city--which proved to be a mask for a hidden evil.  In this particular film, Gwen Mayfield (Fontaine) has spent some time as a school teacher in Africa, where she was attached by disapproving witch doctors and suffered ""a break down in health"" as a result.  Now once more in England, she accepts the position of head mistress of a small private school in the tiny English village of Heddaby, where she is befriended by the wealthy brother and sister Alan and Stephanie Bax (Alan McCowen and Kay Walsh), who fund the school.  Miss Mayfield finds Alan, who seems to have a religious fixation, extremely odd, but she is particularly curious when she notices that most locals disapprove of a seemingly harmless friendship between a boy and girl attending the school.  Not long after odd things begin to occur, and Miss Mayfield becomes uneasy that they are signs of witchcraft.  But are they?  Or is she simply still struggling against the trauma she experienced in Africa?

By his own account direct Cyril Frankel was unhappy with the film, which he had originally envisioned as a dark comedy but which the studio and producers (including, one presumes, Fontaine) forced him to shoot without ironic embellishments.  The resulting movie is hardly in the league of the truly great horror films of its era, but it is nonetheless entertaining, contains a number of effective shocks, and is certainly one of the better ""star vehicle"" movies that Hammer produced.  Fontaine and company have a tendency to overplay and the result is a touch of camp, but that merely adds to the fun, and while the plot becomes increasingly obvious as the film moves along, the story is never dull.  The DVD contains several extras, most notably a brief but interesting look at some of the more famous women who worked for Hammer Studios during the 1960s, including Bette Davis and Tallulah Bankhead; it also offers trailers and television spots.  Recommended for some late night fun!

7882926,4,6305063494,"It was quite enjoyable to see THE WITCHES again after almost 40 years. The widescreen print used for the DVD was in much better shape than the one I saw at the drive-in. I had forgotten most of it but the prologue and the delirious finale came back almost at once. I hadn't realized that Nigel Kneale of QUATERMASS fame had written the screenplay which explains the intelligence and the subtlety on display here which I can appreciate much more now than I did in the early 1970s.

This has to be one of the most beautiful films that Hammer ever made from the beautiful location shooting to the art direction and a very effective score from Richard Rodney Bennett. A teacher (Joan Fontaine) at an African mission suffers a nervous breakdown and tries to restart her life at a quiet country school in England. Slowly she begins to believe that there are sinister goings on beneath the village's picture postcard facade. This ultimately leads to another breakdown and the loss of her memory. There are strong overtones of Hitchcock here as well as earlier Hammer psychological thrillers like SCREAM OF FEAR. There's even an interesting parallel to the much more famous THE WICKER MAN and ROSEMARY'S BABY, both of which came later.

Fontaine reportedly hated THE WITCHES also known as THE DEVIL'S OWN (it was her last feature film) and working for Hammer although you could never guess that by watching it. She is low key but extremely intelligent and vulnerable which is a hard combination to put across. Her clothes and hairstyle look like the Hitchcock films of the 1960s as does some of the editing. Director Cyril Frankel had already made a superior Hammer thriller (NEVER TAKE CANDY FROM A STRANGER) and he brings that same sense of low key tension to this film which is very effective. One of Hammer's best unsung efforts.",1274140800,3,1825,4.753943217665615

The pictures appear murky, bleeding and washed out even though its obviously a direct burn from a genuine Anchor Bay DVD. The sound drops in and out. I played each disc on 3 different players manufactured by 3 different companies. In all I wasted $20 dollars a piece on 3 of these pathetic knock offs. Originally when I purchased these titles there was NO mention of them being bootleg quality DVD-R's. I don't know who's ingenious idea it was to propose such a gross misuse of wasted effort. Either shame on Anchor Bay or shame on Amazon for perpetuating such poor quality knock offs at such an absurd price. They even use the original Anchor Bay DVD's cover art printed by a laser printer however most of the special features listed will not appear.
