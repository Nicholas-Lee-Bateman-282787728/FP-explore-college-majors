8319678,5,B001LS0D7A,"For those who love Sharpe and are a fan of British film, it is well worth the price of the mulit regional player. (I paid $40.00 for mine and it is worth every penny.)  There is no question that this is the best deal you are ever going to get on this series. Save yourself a lot of time and money. It is everything you could hope for and more. Clean and clear picture, much better than the bbc set. Don't bother getting the series one disc at a time. Do the math! You know you want them all and with this, you get all the extras you can't find anywhere else. Even if you add the price of the player, you've still saved yourself a lot of time and money. There is also a region 1 set, though your going to pay more and I couldn't vouch for the quality of the picture. From what I hear, the picture isn't as good and your missing the extras with some of those sets. I bought seven or eight of the original BBC films, so I know not to go there. I still spent less on this than finishing out my collection with individuals. You will still need Sharpe's Challenge and Sharpe's Peril to compleat your collection. Both are set after Waterloo and well worth watching. Sharpe is just one of those films that you can never get enough of. The added plus of having a multi regional player is, you can shop for he best deals, find films that you would otherwise be unable to watch and open up a whole new world of fantastic films you have been missing. Give it a thought. No matter where you live, what ever country, you can have it all. But best of all, you'll have your Sharpe.",1368403200,,1565,4.131147540983607
8319679,5,B001LS0D7A,"For those of us living in the US and were introduced to the series via its Public Broadcasting airing, you and I were sorely let down by the BFS publication of this fantastic movie series.  For those of us with region free players or DVD drives, there is an alternative.

This set is the original publication brought to the Sharpe fan base by ITV.  This set is the complete set of the original 12 made for TV films, shown as intended; from a crisp clear print shot and shown on widescreen.

Even the 12 films were shot on 16mm the R2 DVD presentation has more definition, more vibrant color and crisper sound than the BFS counterpart.  It's almost like watching a different set of films, there's that much difference in the clarity of the R2 release.

In addition there are some extras in the form of photos from the location shoots with notations, as well as historical notes as to who some of characters are based upon.  Animated menus, extras, clearer image and sound, and a nice clean sleek package, you will not be disappointed in buying this set.

So, go get yourself a R2 drive, or hack into your DVD drive, and buy yourself this wonderful series all over again, and watch it as it was meant to be seen.  You WILL NOT regret it!",1280188800,4,1235,4.429203539823009
