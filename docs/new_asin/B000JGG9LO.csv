8150331,2,B000JGG9LO,"There isn't 90 minutes of footage!!!  There is 15 minutes of total footage... maybe.  They show a short clip of a move (most are far from innovative), then they show it again, then it's shown in super slow motion, then it's shown one last time.  The whole time you're screaming to yourself, ""NEXT!""

It's not an instrustional by any means.  As a highlight video, it's content falls flat on it's face.  If you want instructionals go for Marcelo Garcia, or Saulo.  If you want highlights go for 101 Submissions.  If you want to be disappointed, buy something of Marc Laimon's.",1179878400,3,574,4.67
