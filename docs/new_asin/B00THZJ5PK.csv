7009718,5,B00THZJ5PK,i read the reveiw at bluray.com and the reveiwer says the bluray is no good well pilligram your so wrong i think the video looks great much better than the dvd it sure is worth 8 bucks too bad the audio isn't remastered in 5.1 is the only drawback. i don't trust any reveiws anymore at bluray.com.,1433894400,4,297,4.228070175438597

7009724,2,B00THZJ5PK,"This is a great western.  Unfortunately the Blu-ray version (above) is being released with a severely reduced picture ratio.  I have, in my hand, the DVD release at ""Aspect Ratio"" of 2.35:1 (widescreen) as the film was shown originally.  Unfortunately this release on Blu-Ray is the smaller Aspect Ratio of 1.78:1.  I also notice that the DVD version selling on Amazon now says the Aspect Radio is ""Unknown"".  Guess they don't want anyone to check to see if the Blu-Ray about to be released is the origional theater release size.  5 stars for the movie but minus at least 3 stars for the reduced picture size.",1427068800,7,609,4.69811320754717

7009773,4,B00THZJ5PK,"JW oater family style. Wayne as the absentee U.S. Marshall father whose boys fall in with some bank robbers and otherwise despicable types. Up to our hero to save men wrongly convicted of a killing during a bank robbery, straighten out his sons, and deal with the real  bad guys. Not one of JW's best, but not a bad film either, the story being a bit more complex than a typical JW western. JW's screen time is shared with the actors playing his sons, so not so much front and center JW in this film, though he's effective when on screen. I saw this movie first run, in the early 70's and was a bit disappointed in it then, but having just watched the blu-ray release, I think it's aged well. Actors playing JW's sons do a nice job and George Kennedy as the chief villain is sufficiently menacing. And a nice relationship is portrayed between JW and his half breed Indian tracker. Picture and sound were both first rate. A nice addition to any western and/or JW collection. I would recommend.",1437868800,7,992,4.450549450549451
7009774,4,B00THZJ5PK,"'J.D.Cahill' (John Wayne) is a lawman that can face down a number of villains at a time, yet struggles as a widower
bringing up two young sons, 'Billy-Joe' (Clay O'Brian) aged 11 and 'Daniel' (Gary Grimes) aged 17, 'J.D' is always
away too long.
While 'J.D' is bringing in some outlaws he'd caught, back in town a deliberate fire in a barn has been set to cause a
diversion allowing 'Fraser' (George Kennedy) and his gang to get out of jail long enough to rob the towns bank, and
try and put themselves back behind bars while the Sheriff and town folk tend to the fire, not everything goes to plan,
they have to kill the Sheriff who had been alerted to the robbery.
J.D' is now back in town and is puzzled why a posse from town fail to pick up any tracks....
He deputises his son 'Danny' and along with tracker 'Lightfoot' (Neville Brand) set out to try and pick up the trail the
possse had failed to find, they come across 4 men who have new-money on their person, 'J.D' arrests them, though
his son insists that he doesn't think they were responsible...'J.D' will ponder his sons reactions, realizing that his sons
played some part in the robbery, trouble is for 'J.D' just how deep is their involvement.
Meanwhile 'Fraser' wants the money that he's willing to let 4 innocent men hang for, trouble is, he has to turn to
'Billy-Joe' to recover the ill-gotten gains.
With it's usual mix of gun-play and indeed humour often seen in 'John Wayne' westerns, watching the 'Duke' in action
is always a pleasurable experience even though you may well have seen the film a few times before.
Films like this built the legend that was and remains -'John Wayne'
Good upgrade to the Blu-ray Format.
