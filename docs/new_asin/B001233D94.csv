The music is soothing and beautiful, the instructor is very good too - easy to follow.  If you are looking for a non-strenuous but effective workout for an elderly relative - this is perfect.  I like a more vigerous workout, but this is a great way to loosen up the muscles and get the blood flowing and it is an excerise my mom and I can do together, which makes it more special.  I highly recommend this product.",1246320000,,558,4.08256880733945
