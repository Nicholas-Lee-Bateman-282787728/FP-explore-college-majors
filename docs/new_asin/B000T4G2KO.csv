2894691,5,B000T4G2KO,"I have 4 of Debbie's dvd's and love her easy to follow exersizes.  In others in which you are doing complicated footwork and your arms are doing something else I just got frustrated and would do one or the other and not get the benifits.

Debbie gets you moving, uses enough talk to give you form instructions without the nonstop blather other instructors can be known to do",1234483200,10,374,4.485294117647059
2894692,5,B000T4G2KO,"Quick, efficient, hits all the body parts, room for advancement, makes me sweat and makes me sore the next day...",1375401600,2,113,4.7
2894693,4,B000T4G2KO,"This DVD works the core with some cardio involvement.  Focus is on the core. May not be enough cardio by itself for some, may be just right for a day following more intense cardio.  A good product overall, devoid of the loud music and the 'overdone' enthusiasm over nothing of the instructor like some other workout videos. (You've seen them,  the ones with lot's of current urban catch phrases and other useless junk.)  It's a workout, not a surgical procedure or a Stanley Cup Finals hockey game, it's a workout. I say just do it and shut up.  This video does it and shuts up. I like this instructor and her video.",1369267200,5,616,4.464285714285714
2894694,5,B000T4G2KO,This is a great dvd even for beginners it's not forever long like most of Beach body's  workout DVD's. Mine Is a keeper!,1361491200,,120,4.217391304347826
2894695,5,B000T4G2KO,"I have done other Slim in 6 workouts, and they truly work. It may not look like you are doing much of anything, but those muscles begin working and you do indeed burn lots of calories. The commercial is right, you will burn nearly 1000 calories per workout! I was shocked when I saw my heart rate monitor, I had burned 945 calories in one workout! So I know for a fact that these Slim in 6 videos work. Anyways, if you are looking to slim down, tone your muscles, lift your booty, and get a great cardio workout with a mild down to earth instructor then Slim in 6 is for you. The Cardio Core made me sore the next day, and I definitely felt the burn with this dvd. Highly recommended.",1355788800,9,684,4.150375939849624
2894696,5,B000T4G2KO,"If you are on the fence about what dvd to get...GET THIS ONE! Especially if you have ummm...a lot of work to do to get to your goal. It is very effective, totally do-able even if you are not in the best shape but challenging enough to get a good work out. I have several of Debbie's dvds and while I like her and appreciate that she doesn't do crazy stuff your average out of shape individual can't do, her work outs are on the longish side. This is just under 30 minutes and gets the job done.",1335830400,3,494,4.051020408163265
2894697,5,B000T4G2KO,"I used this workout video three times a week and lost a total of 5 inches in 5 weeks. it was actually amazing, it was simple to do. beginners can do it. and it also helps tone your arms! i love this video!",1328140800,10,205,3.7906976744186047
2894698,3,B000T4G2KO,"I just finished this workout and I was kinda disappointed. I read the reviews and thought this has to be a good sweat inducing workout. Also based that opinion after doing Debbie's Slim in 10 years ago. DVDs #2 and #3 are awesome, but maybe I was out of shape then. But this was eh at best. Of course, like other workout DVDs of Debbie's something is off. On this one, there is a woodchop move on one side then never on the other. Ugh! Okay, so not impressive and not a big calorie burn at all. Not efficient if you are in great shape. I agree with the other reviewer that this is a mild ab workout at best. I think all the 5 stars have to be from people who are out of shape. I workout for an hour for 5  days a week and rather intensely I should add. I say if you are at your goal this is a nice mild workout, but it won't get your to your goal if you are already in great shape but need a few pounds to hit the road!",1320192000,9,919,3.836842105263158
2894699,4,B000T4G2KO,"I would have been really happy with this DVD... if I could read it on my french computer !! Unfortunately I can't ! But if I review it it's because my sisters have it at home and I've done the workout several times with them and loved it (which is why I wanted to buy one for me). I mostly the same exercises seen in slim in 6, but its done with more 'enthusiasm', it seems more 'modern', plus she has addes new moves in this video to really sweat it out ! And it was cheaper than slim in 6 (but there are less exercise workouts on the cardio core than on the slim in 6). So I recommend !",1290816000,2,588,3.8677685950413223
2894700,5,B000T4G2KO,If you stick with this video it does make a difference in how you feel about yourself.  More positive feelings the more you workout to this video.,1287100800,,146,4.407407407407407
2894701,1,B000T4G2KO,This is a really mild ab workout.  I can't imagine getting any results from using this.,1240531200,2,87,4.4375
8207747,2,B000T4G2KO,"Workout could have been okay but at 20 minutes into it she does what she refers to as a ""woodchopper move"" on her right side, then never repeats the move on the left.  Ruined it for me.",1481414400,,185,4.0
8207748,5,B000T4G2KO,"This is a good addition to Slim in 6. Not as busy/cardio like original, but mainly targeted for the waist and stomach.  So far I'm happy!  I use this for warm-ups and lazy days. After 2 weeks I noticed my waist is firming up.",1479340800,,225,4.090909090909091

8207750,5,B000T4G2KO,"I absolutely love this workout!!! it does what is states..I have about 7 of Debbie's workout videos and this is by far my favorite. The moves in the video are concentrated on the core area; another words you will be doing plenty of moves to make your mid section smaller, the video is mostly doing workouts for the waist area. And she incorporates cardio moves the flow to the video is really smooth...",1425340800,2,402,4.52054794520548

8207752,5,B000T4G2KO,"I like this workout DVD because its only 30minute and she hits pretty much all my targeted fat spots. Seems easy but you will burn lots of calories, especially if using the weights. I used 2lbs weights and needed a nap shortly afterwards.",1396396800,2,238,4.558139534883721
8207753,4,B000T4G2KO,I have Slim in Six and was looking for something quick to do over the long videos. This is wonderful core work without having to get on the floor. I work from home so its very easy to turn on the TV get thirty minutes in and go right back to work:-),1388534400,,249,3.8076923076923075
8207754,5,B000T4G2KO,"After I had my first child, I had ordered the entire slim series, which I enjoyed, and it came with this 30 minute quick cardio routine that I loved. I love it because its high intensity and a half hour so I can almost always find the time to do it. Soon, I had retired all my other excersise programs because this was everything I needed. I lost the baby weight in record time and even after having another child I swear by this dvd. I also LOVE the six minute ab portion, if you stay committed the results are awesome. I was so happy to find the dvd on amazon after literally using my first one to death, Love it!",1384992000,4,615,4.090909090909091
8207755,5,B000T4G2KO,"I enjoy the workout, and love that it is express as I am very busy but always feel better when I work out.  This lets me fit a workout in when I am extra short on time.",1384819200,,168,3.5405405405405403
8207756,4,B000T4G2KO,"Good quick workout when time is limited.  More on the beginner level, but if you keep with the pace it is a decent workout when you're short on time.",1383609600,,149,4.137931034482759
