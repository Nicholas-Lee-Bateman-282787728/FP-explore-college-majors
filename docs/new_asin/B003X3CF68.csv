4215217,5,B003X3CF68,"This movie is both inspiring and worrisome. Inspiring because it shows clear proof that people ARE getting better results from non toxic alternative treatments. Worrisome because the dogged insistence on thickheaded-ness by the medical establishment is boggling. I mean, why can't we finally start telling the truth about alternative med for use in cancer? (I'm not naive, it's obvious why the truth is not being told - this movie only makes it crystal clear)

If you haven't see it yet, I HIGHLY recommend you see these video clips (links are listed in the comments attached to this review):

They are NOT about cancer. But they are very enlightening with regards to something as plain as day, yet conventional med REFUSES to acknowledge it. Namely a guy's life was saved by high dose vitamin C, yet they simply won't acknowledge they made what would have been a fatal mistake. These videos are another slant on the conventional VS alternative dilemma we are in - but free. Incredible!",1294617600,12,986,4.933734939759036
4215218,5,B003X3CF68,"... to see how much government and organizations (like the FDA) are corrupt AND, mostly, to know there are solutions for cancer and that there's no more need to spend billions on research. This wonderfully made movie explains very clearly, always stating the sources of its informations, how it works when real good discoveries happen, so it can make Dr. Burzynski's case and cancer solution largely known, and medicine more good will-based in the future. We hope so, because solutions like Dr. Burzynski's must become available to everyone and make chemotherapy history. I hope to see a documentary of this kind about hyperbaric therapy (to treat Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Alzheimer's...) and pulsed electromagnetic fields devices (PEMFs), to name a few, because the list of suppressed health solutions is very long.",1292976000,16,815,5.276923076923077

4215220,5,B003X3CF68,"I had heard of Dr. Burzynski's name in the shadows.  I had even heard that the Clinical Trials he was involved in were not done according to protocol.  But I did not have the big picture of what was happening in his professional life.  This film is a chilling allegory for all of us about the power of money and corruption in our country, even at the highest levels of government.  Burzynski's treatment of brain cancers and his successes should be known to all so an informed choice about treatment can be made.

This film once again demonstrates the power that a documentary can having in shedding light on the truth.  A most important film!",1287619200,31,643,4.547826086956522
4215221,5,B003X3CF68,"As a cancer survivor, I am always interested in cancer research. Dr. Burzynski from Stafford, Texas, has made what may be the best discovery ever in cancer research. As a biochemist and physician, he found naturally-occurring peptides made by the human body which seem to inhibit cancerous cells from multiplying. Cancer patients typically lack these compounds, which he calls ""antineoplastons."" So he synthesized them and used them to treat about 50 types of cancer during the last 30 years, achieving much better cure rates than conventional chemo/radiation without side effects! He has had particularly good success with brain cancer patients, especially children, who were written off as having a fatal condition. Why haven't we heard about him before? Because the Texas Board of Medicine prohibits him from practicing his treatments outside of Texas.

  And here is where it gets really ugly. Since the 1980's the FDA has harassed him and tried to force him out of business. He went through four grand jury investigations, and was not indicted in each case. He was even brought to trial but acquitted, supported by many grateful patients whose raised money for his defense. The FDA even raided his offices, seizing 300,000 pages of patient records. He was then allowed to have them photocopied for his practice, at his expense. Why? Cancer treatment is a billion-dollar industry and the pharmaceutical companies stand to lose big-time if a safe alternative treatment becomes the standard. The FDA was chastized by Congressional members during a hearing for persecuting Dr. Burzynski, and it finally allowed him to conduct clinically-controlled trials on his own medicine. Dr. Davorit Samid, who was previously hired by his Clinic to do research on antineoplastons, is now employed by the National Cancer Institute. She and the NCI have applied for and received patents on these compounds, on which Burzynski has held patents for some time. Patent infringment is serious business.
  This documentary may be panned by some movie critics (and we all know how objective they are) but the information it contains is priceless.",1282694400,182,2126,5.241176470588235
4215222,5,B003X3CF68,"I saw this movie in a small theatre. It is mainly a documentary about Dr Burzynski and his discovery of antineoplastins to cure cancers. There are actual patient stories of amazing cures of incurable cancers using his protocol. Also his fight to be able to continue using his medication protocol and his fight with big pharma and the other powers to be.

It was very enlightening to see what happens behind closed doors. There is so much corruption going on in the government that we don't know about.

I would highly recommend this movie because of the information you gain about the government and also that there are other ways to get rid of cancer without going the chemo/radiation protocol that this country insists on as the only way, and how they get big bucks following it.

Anyone who has had cancer, or knows someone that does or may have, definately needs to see this movie before submitting to the fear that they will die if they don't take the chemo/radiation route.

EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE, IT IS LIFESAVING, THE SOONER YOU GET IT THE SOONER YOU CAN SAVE A LIFE.

If we want to use his treatment, we should have the right to make that decision!!!!!!!!  FDA and Big Pharma are corrupt, and they are only bullying Dr. Burzynski and other doctors out there just like him, because they are a threat to their bottom line.  I hope the American people will wake up to their lies, and start to fight for the truth.  Thank you Dr. Burzynski for continuing to fight this fight, and not giving up!  You are hero in my eyes!!!!!

4215251,1,B003X3CF68,"I enjoyed the movie and I think that it helps expose lies in the medical establishment, but if I had cancer I wouldn't go to the Burzynski Clinic. I have had several friends with cancer and have seen some go conventional and some go alternative routes. Considering both ways there have been good, bad and ugly outcomes.

As for Burzinski, I had a friend named Fred (one of the nicest funniest guys you would ever meet) and he battled reoccuring boughts of Brain Cancer for about 10 years. Our church loved him so much that when his last bought came on that we raised nearly $75,000 so that he could go to Burzynski's. The program took him though the cost is over a $100,000 for treatment and about 3/4 of the way through they informed him that he was running out of money and that they don't take credit so he was sent home and died.

For far less than $75,000 anyone could do far more than what he got at Burzynski, you could be set up to help many friends with cancer for that kind of money.

If I ever get cancer and need to go some place, it will be Home for Health in Kentucky,HomeforHealth .net, it is a Christian place not trying to make money off of sick people! I would also recommend people to look at CancerTutor. org as they can get a lot of helpful information for free.

That's my two cents.",1402012800,4,1305,4.271255060728745
4215252,5,B003X3CF68,"This movie is very well done with valuable information.

4215255,5,B003X3CF68,I heard of Dr. B many years ago. This is typical of todays  refusal to accept or even investigate any cure other than Big Phama dictates. This is a real disgrace and the government is to blame.,1395446400,2,193,4.216216216216216
4215256,5,B003X3CF68,I highly recommend seeing this documentary for those who want a change in cancer treatment.  No one should suffer with their cancer treatment and so many people suffer with chemo and radiation.  Burzynski takes treating cancer to a new level with a new treatment that really works and no one suffers from terrible side effects.  This documentary also exposes the fraudulent practice in our failed medical system so it is a real eye opener.,1394323200,,439,4.905405405405405

4215259,5,B003X3CF68,"As Above, the DVD is heart-wrenching to watch. Eric Merola has done such a good job with this documentary and I thank him for it. He has made himself instrumental in waking us up to the insidiousness of the AMA, FDA, American Cancer Society, Big Pharma, etc. It is unfortunate that most people do not read, but here is a good replacement for reading. Watch this video and see what is going on as a cancer in our society....the lack of true information, the proficiency of the disinformation machinery we call the mainstream media. I cried while watching the documentary. It was impossible not to. The dismal mistreatment this wonderful doctor is going through is just too painful to watch. Recently, USA Today had Dr. Burzynski on the cover, only to malign him some more after Eric Merola produced a sequel to this documentary. This documentary made me regret those days when I was involved with administering chemotherapy to my patients. I will never let that happen again. And if you do decide to read, read about Dr. Simoncini from Italy and the late Dr. Gerson (with healing centers in Hungary and Mexico). Read ""Healing the Gerson Way"".

The testimony of the SF police officer in the first five minutes of the movie is so touching and moving, that I remained speechless for a few minutes myself. This documentary also shows the corruption in our medical industry, where FDA is in bed with Big Pharmacological Industry and they will do whatever it takes to destroy anyone and anything that could threatened their big profits. The movie shows that the mighty $$ comes first, the well being of the patient second.
I repeat myself again, saying that there is nothing in this world that would force me to undergo chemotherapy or radiation, if diagnosed with a cancer of any kind. I find it absurd to treat a sick and weak human body with a poison, that destroys the bad cells as well as the good cells??",1386806400,4,878,4.598726114649682
4215263,2,B003X3CF68,"Like many who watched this film (and wrote 5-star reviews) I was outraged at what I saw. Here was a doctor that apparently created a cure for some of the worst types of cancer, who was prosecuted by the FDA and his discovery suppressed, then patents taken out by others on his cure for their own financial gain. It tugged at my heartstrings and allegedly confirmed what I'd heard about before: there's a concerted effort to suppress any cancer cures that don't involve mainstream treatments, like chemo and radiation.

However, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, there's two sides to every story and ""Burzynski, the Movie"" only presents one side. Without going into the opposing details (that have been covered by other reviewers) I recommend going to wikipedia, and other sources, to research them.

Like most everyone, I would like to know about a cure for cancer that doesn't involve destructive therapies like chemo and radiation. However, after looking at other info on Burzynski I'm skeptical of the movie's claims.",1382659200,,1030,4.982558139534884

4215275,5,B003X3CF68,"You will love this movie and won't be able to turn your eyes away. It's very well done and SO interesting. I highly recommend you watch it. I watched this movie a week ago and have not stopped thinking about it the whole time. I have literally told every family member and co-worker (and even some customers) to watch it. I was so compelled after seeing Burzynski 1, that I just watched Burzynski 2 last night. Equally as good. I suggest you watch them both. The movie is about Dr Burzynski, who seems to have discovered a cure for cancer, or at least a better treatment for it, and how it's being withheld from the American public because big pharma won't be able to profit from it.

Almost everyone in America seems to know someone who has died from cancer. It's important to watch this movie because there are breakthrough treatments for cancer that are being kept from us. One of my best friends from college, Ryn, just died from brain cancer (oligodendroglioma) in 2009 at age 42. leaving 2 small children behind. She actually didn't die from the cancer, she died from the radiation treatments, which weakened her blood vessels in her brain and she had many strokes, which did her in. To think that this non toxic antineoplaston treatment was available the entire time she had cancer and it was withheld from her by the FDA because of greed. It makes me sick. After watching this movie you will want the FDA to be held accountable. I'd like the head of the FDA put in jail.

Watching this movie made me aware of the FDA, something most people (and I) have not thought much about. I was shocked to realize
(my opinion)that the FDA is not watching out for public health. They are watching out for big pharma's bottom line. I had heard that the FDA was corrupt before but after watching this movie, it put it in a whole new light. It will take regular citizens doing ""something"" to make a difference to fix this for society. America is supposed to be the greatest country on earth. We are better than this. We need to fix the FDA. I think we should actually shut the FDA down and start a new agency called the Public Health Authority (PHA). (An idea I thought of when I woke up this morning.) Watch the movie and make up your own mind.

PS. I want to thank Dr Burzynski for all the years of hard work and caring. I can't believe all that he has put up with. America has been worse to him than communist Poland. I'm ashamed, but will try to do something to make up for it.",1381104000,,2478,4.3847826086956525

They are only interested in maintaining your sick status and sell you drugs/tests/surgeries. Look at all these inhibitor types of medicines they sell, like those controlling histamine, blood pressure, and cholesterol. They only block the nature defensive responses of your body, rather than treating the root cases, which might often simply be your processed foods (read the Wheat Belly book, among others).

Even with this preparation, I was literally shocked off my chair when watching this movie. It is unimaginable how far a government agency could do to make sure the business of cancer treatment can keep pumping money.

I have no doubt that each individual has to do his/her own research before signing up any expensive and dangerous treatment agreements. We are extremely lucky to live in an era when Internet and Google is available so patients and families can educate themselves instead of blindly following the car mechanics (so called medical doctors).

Have you ever wondered, after having spent hundreds of billions of dollars on cancer research over the last 60 years, why we still rely on decades old radiation and chemotherapy that makes people sick while trying to make them better?

Burzinsky is a sobering look at how collusion, greed, arrogance and power have stymied collaboration, outstanding research, and incredible breakthroughs in this so called ""Best HealthCare System in the World"".  The gut wrenching injustice directed toward a brilliant, driven, medical research oncologist, Dr. Stanislaw Burzinsky, who stumbled upon and patented a class of biological compounds that cure cancer, is the subject of this movie.

The way that the NCI, FDA and Big-Pharma tried to ruin this scientist was simply appalling!  If you thought the Mob was nasty maintaining its territory, just watch how dastardly these rotten to the core mega health care players use the legal system to take out Burzinsky.  Their behavior is unbelievable, unforgivable, and unethical showing complete disregard for the Hippocratic Oath.  The callous disrespect toward the afflicted and their heart-wrenching stories of struggle has left this American disturbed and wary of these organizations!",1343174400,,1364,5.282407407407407
4215357,5,B003X3CF68,"This is a documentary about Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski who in 1977 discovered a non-toxic cure for cancer. He found that cancer patients usually lack compounds called antineoplastons. In order to cure cancer, he synthesizes these compounds and uses them to treat some cancer patients successfully at his institute in Texas. He has treated many hopeless cases, usually children, where the cancer they had was known to be fatal with our typical cancer treatment. Instead these children and some adults are walking around today totally cancer free. Although he is not successful in all cases, Dr. Burzynski has a noticeably higher cure rate than the toxic regimen our current medical system uses to treat cancer (chemo and radiation).

What is very enlightening about this movie is that the federal government (specifically the FDA) has been trying to put him behind bars for treating cancer. However, the real reason they are doing this is because there are billions of dollars to be lost if our society does not continue the toxic cancer regiment that currently exists.  After all many companies have huge investments in equipment and drugs and that revenue would be lost if a cure for cancer was found.  Also, these big companies do not want one guy to receive all the profits  as Dr. Burzynski holds all the patents for his treatment.

In this documentary, you'll also learn that one of his former colleagues who now works for the government was able to get the federal government to issue duplicate patents to her in an effort to steal his work.  Luckily, Dr. Burzynski successfully thwarted that effort.

The federal government did everything they could to discredit this doctor and throw him in jail and failed.  They even tried to pretend to work with him by offering to trial his regimen.  In fact, this was the absolutely most chilling point about this documentary.  Once again, the federal government (specifically the National Cancer Institute) purposely altered Dr. Burzynski's cancer treatment in a trial they were doing by reducing the antineoplastons regimen that he prescribed.  The National Cancer Institute knew that all the patients would die in this study with that regiment but they did it anyway so that they could discredit him and steal his treatment. To me this is pre-meditated murder.

The story told here is appalling.  Every day that antineoplastons don't become an available option in our society to treat cancer is another day one or more patients dies from the disease.

A non-toxic cure for cancer exists that is more effective than our current toxic chemotherapy and radiation treatments and offers better chances for survival in many cases. I commend Dr. Burzynski for having such character to continue to fight for his right to make his cancer treatment more successful and appears to care so much about curing the cancer patient.",1343174400,2,2861,5.033898305084746

Here's the scoop. Dr. Burzynski has developed a non-toxic method for curing most cancers. His success rate is at about 25% though some trials showed it as high as 50%. One of the important aspects of his treatment is, even if it doesn't cure you, it won't put you through the same hell as chemo-therapy or radiation treatment. The FDA didn't like that so they kept dragging him in front of Grand Juries. After all, they have a multi-billion dollar industry in place. So what if it isn't all that good. We're talking money here. He survived the Grand Juries, so they figured, if you can't beat him, steal his patents. Which is exactly what they did.

This is an outstanding documentary. It starts by showing the reasoning behind his treatment as well as the process. You get the testimonies from all the cured patients, along with their words on what they were told from various other doctors on how they, or their child wouldn't live past ""X"" months. These ducks are all lined up in a row and there is little, if any question, that the FDA and the pharmaceutical companies are a bunch of scumbags that aren't as interested in helping people as they are in helping themselves. One of the worst aspects of their witch hunt was that they weren't questioning the efficacy of his treatment. They were trying to nail him on more commerce related issues. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, isn't the value of the treatment the first consideration? Can't the irrelevant details be worked on later?

The ""Walk for Cancer"" and the pink ribbons are a good show, but, as of now, I wouldn't give them one thin dime or a minute of my time. They are criminals and  deserve to be hanged by their miserable throats. What they did to Dr. Burzinski is unconscionable.

As a graduate of journalism school, I look for cited sources and this film puts all the documents right out in the open. The only people who argue with these documented facts are those that don't like what those papers have to say and you must ask why. Watch this film and tell me if you want someone else telling you what you should and shouldn't see, or what medical treatment you should be allowed to choose. I'm currently studying holistic nutrition and I know how non-patentable healing herbs are not discussed by the average doctor and this film shows why they only offer patented pharmaceuticals. Yet watch this film to see documents of numerous cases and courtroom testimonials of patients of Dr. Burzynski who have, in fact, been cured by his treatments. The issue is that the discovery of this cure was not in the hands of the the establishment and, since they could not profit and this more effective treatment would likely detract from their profits, it is pushed off as not sufficiently tested when, in fact, has been extensively tested and proven effective more times over.

I also do not understand why the one-star comments claim others could not duplicate Dr. Burzynski's findings when they were clearly stated by the Dr. Friedman of the National Cancer Institute when he was filing (stealing) Dr. Burzynski's patents from the gov't tests results used in trying to justify the patents.

IN OTHER WORDS .... the details are in the documents cited in the documentary ... how can others claim these don't exists???  Did they even watch the documentary or are they just commenting without having watched it ???",1333065600,3,797,4.845588235294118
4215384,1,B003X3CF68,"This is just one more in a long series of polemical faux-documentaries promoting the commercial interests of people who have failed to carry scientific opinion. It should be viewed alongside other nonsense like Zeitgeist and What The Bleep - it is wholly uncritical, subscribes wholeheartedly to the idea of a global campaign to suppress miracle cures, and does not even try to be in any way balanced.

There are several reasons why people think Burzynski is a quack, none of them to do with any external agency. He has not published his so-called miracle cure for scientific peer-review (meaning that only he can profit from it); he has not published the results of his many ""trials"", he charges tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars for the trials when such trials are normally free to the patient; his ethical review board failed to perform any ethical review; he charges many times the going rate for standard drugs and insists that those drugs be supplied only by his in-house pharmacy; he uses thuggish tactics against critics. None of these are under anyone's control but his own.

So, if you want to watch a lengthy whining advert for a man making a lot of money from desperate people, this will do you nicely. If you'd rather do something to support curing cancer then you need to send the money to one of the cancer charities because they, unlike Burzynski, share the results of the work so everyone can benefit. Oh, and they publish so their claims can be objectively challenged. Oh, and they don't send the rottweilers after teenagers who criticise them on Twitter.",1330041600,13,1585,4.802197802197802

4215416,1,B003X3CF68,"This ""documentary"" is brought to you by the same folks who made the infamous conspiracy film ZEITGEIST.  Yes, that one: the mother of all conspiracy films, the most insane of them all, and the most widely debunked film in history.  Go look it up.  It's like every conspiracy theory known to man all rolled up into one lunatic movie.  9/11 truthers, anti-Semite world bank mind control, some random Da Vinci Code stuff about Jesus, it's all in there.

The director of the ""documentary"" Burzynski will do anything to prevent you all from knowing that his career is that of a conspiracy theory peddler.  He used a false name for his role in Zeitgeist, and will delete any comment on youtube or vimeo who mentions this part of his filmography.  But the fact remains (and is easy to verify if you google it): Eric Clinton Merola = Eric Clinton (on the Zeitgeist IMDB page).  He made ZEITGEIST, and made a ton of money selling DVDs of ZEITGEIST, with his brother Peter Joseph Merola --  who goes by Peter Joseph.

So let's leave the science aside for a second.  And you tell me: does a real doctor hire a known conspiracy crank to make a documentary about him?

Another way of asking my question would be:  Yes, I know there are a lot of vested interests and corrupted aspects of the mainstream scientific community.  But ultimately, who would you rather believe:  the mainstream scientific community, or the lunatics who made ZEITGEIST who never met a conspiracy theory they didn't love and has NO PROBLEM ETHICALLY with just lying outright in his films (as proven in the past)?

Of course, it is not easy to convince some people that there are those in our government and the pharmaceutical and medical world that would actually allow so many people to suffer and die, when there are natural non-toxic treatments in existence that have actually cured many people of cancer...even after the medical doctors have given up on them.  I think of the fathers, mothers and children who are taken from us early because of our failed system of treating cancer.  Many of my own family and friends have died from cancer, after receiving the ""best"" that medicine has to offer.  We watched helplessly as they suffered through agonizing pain and nausea, being brave and hopeful to the end.  And then to watch their families suffer their loss for years.  I finally learned about Dr. Burzynski and others like him, amazingly gifted doctors and scientists, who have studied the nature of cancer and how to help our body's natural healing processes to prevent and kill cancer cells.  I've read several books and researched the subject on the internet.  I didn't believe at first that such a thing could happen in this country.  I couldn't believe that human beings could be evil enough to allow so much suffering and death.  But, after months of reading and pondering, I now understand that for some people, money is the only thing that matters.  Even though they bring about the tragic, unneccessary death of many, many trusting people.  If you watch this movie for the first time, you will be blown away with the truth.  But even so, it is truth that we must face.  Only when people in great numbers come to see the truth about our situation, will we be able to rise up and demand changes.  We are all accountable for how we serve our fellow beings.  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.  This movie is very, very well done, and is our best hope for a real cure for cancer (and any other disease) today.  Incidentally, an excellent book on the subject of alternative non-toxic cancer treatments (if you only have time to read one) is ""Outsmart Your Cancer"" by Tanya Harter Pierce. It took me a long time to finish it, as I was really studying it, but it taught me so much about how the body works and how to avoid disease and what to do if cancer strikes.

4215421,4,B003X3CF68,"Having watched this film and read a number of the reviews, I have to say that some are missing the point of this film.

For me, if you are getting caught up in the films supposed 'bias', or the scientific provability of the success of the treatment, without asking the bigger questions that the film uncovers very successfully for the viewer, then I would argue you that are watching the film through your own biased goggles.  Getting both sides of the story is important, and so is the science of the matter, but to expect this from a documentary is unrealistic.  The purpose of the film is to create awareness of the issue.  If you want balance and science you're going to have to get your elbows dirty in research.

I don't have the time to become an expert on everything, so when analysing the various controversial medical issues such as vaccines or cancer treatment or HIV/Aids, I find it very useful to ask the ""WHY?"" question, and for helping me do that this film is excellent.

Sometimes, in lieu of actually knowing or having the time/money/energy/brainpower to research the actual data or actual physiology of an issue, it can be very useful to ask the ""WHY?"" question in forging your path toward the truth.  This method of 'truth discovery' may not be scientific, but it is very useful for the non-specialist out there.

If we can ask the ""WHY?"" questions, get answers to them, and then evaluate the strength of those answers and the ability of the other side to respond again in turn, we get closer to the truth.

The ""WHY?"" questions from the film are:

-Why has Burzynski won all his court cases?
-Why do new court cases keep being brought forth (and lost) by the governing authorities?
-Why can Burzynski only practice in Texas?  Surely what's good for the goose is good for the other 49 ganders?
-Why are hundreds of people protesting in favour of Burzynski's treatment?
-If the antineoplaston method is bunk, why did the NCI and an ex-Burzynski employee try to take out a duplicate patent on Burzynski's methods at the same time they were trying to shut him down through the courts?
-Why aren't mature adults with terminal cancer allowed to choose their or their children's treatment no matter how untested and unconventional?
-Why are there no stories of toxic reaction to Burzynski's methods?
-Why are some people clearly being cured by the treatments into full remission?
-Why is Dr. Burzynski still in business after 25 years of practicing his treatment? If he was a charlatan as many of the critics claim, how is he still fooling people?  Where is the great 'Burzynski expos'?

Critics of the film and Burzynski's methods must now answer these questions.  The mainstream medical establishment must pool its gargantuan resources and make its own documentary addressing these.  The film makes some serious claims - these must now stand up to scrutiny.

Most important of all, people should realise that this is a freedom issue.  The freedom of mature, consenting adults to choose.  Choose products, choose treatments.  This film therefore is step toward more informed choice in people's healthcare choices.

Most did not know about Burzynski's treatment before.  Now they do.

The reason for only 4 stars: The film is +-20min too long and requires a lot of concentration toward the end as it becomes very narration intensive and also requires a lot of reading of text on the screen to piece the legal drama together.  The directors did a great job of getting a complex web of problems across very clearly, but I would certainly recommend watching the film in two sittings with a nap or energy snack in between:)",1322956800,10,3632,4.79454253611557

Is the FDA (my government) doing what is best for me?

Burzynski has a treatment that does no harm... and maybe it does no good, DOES NOT MATTER.... what this movie did for me was expose a simple truth...

Our government is too big and corrupt to care about us.

To further heighten my skepticism, after watching this movie, a friend turned me on to ""Food Inc."" which reveals harmful flaws in another government agency that supposedly ""has our back"". The USDA.

You may be skeptical of the Burzynski treatment and the movie but I think it is important to recognize some simple truths.

He has been sued by the FDA (and Texas medical board) several times, the same agency that approved his trials, and he has won every time.

-Why is he being sued when the treatment doe no harm?

Bruzynski is now on the second stage... with a vengeance! Add to this component the billions of dollars at stake for 'big pharma', and you can understand the context of how this story is being played out.  The movie makes certain assertions that not even their detractors deny, so I take them for truths:  traditional therapy consisting on radiation plus chemo has a cure rate of under 1%, when 'cure' is defined as cancer free after 5 years.  At the same time, that therapy costs tens of thousands per patient (billions yearly as income for the pharmaceutical companies that hold the patents).  Either the individual, the insurance company and/or all of us pay through taxes, Obamacare, etc. for those treatments that have almost zero chances of curing.  Life (while it lasts) is miserable for those under radiation/chemo.  This doctor in Texas comes up with a treatment which lots of normal people previously given-up by doctors, are alive and cancer free after many years following treatment with Burzinsky.  How does anyone dare to try to shut him down?  FDA tried to indict him 4+ times (the hearings in Congress questioning the head of the FDA are shown in the movie, they are not made-up).

If it was not true, given the vendetta of big pharma, FDA, NIH, National Cancer Institute, etc. the movie would be already confiscated and out of circulation on a Court's decision for libel, etc.  I think that a Nobel price (perhaps posthumous, this doctor is not getting any younger)will be the (happy) epilogue to this story.  How many people will have unnecessarily suffered, died and families gone broke because this treatment has been demonized over many decades?  They will weight in the conscious of a few bureaucrats and their patrons. In a way, you can validate the efficacy of this therapy by the extreme efforts of their detractors to kill it.  5 attempts to indict him failed, and they are still trying?  Raided his clinic, confiscated all medical records only to return them when they failed in Court to shut them down?  Patent fraud?

If FDA is in the clutches of big pharma companies, I wonder how many FDA clearances were issued under non-medical grounds! A nation had to spend $60 million and had 6 senate committees just to put one Dr. out of practice and into prison... and yet none of the charges against him were proved.  Is it really happening in the USA?

If Dr. Burzynski's claim for effective cancer treatment is true, may he consider to relocate to another country where his treatment may be allowed?  Many cancer patients will go to any place wherever better treatment is available. Even if he could save a few lives, it will be a great service to mankind.

His story sounds similar to that of 19th century's Louis Pasteur who was exiled into a remote area out of Paris, and who had ultimately invented preventive vaccines for deadly diseas like anthrax, rabies, etc.

4215471,5,B003X3CF68,"This is one of the most powerful films on the subject of cancer that I have ever seen and I first heard about on my buddy Sean Croxton's ""Underground Wellness Radio Show."" It's called Burzynski: The Movie from filmmaker Eric Merola. With a background in making documentaries and in television, Eric decided to use his skills to bring to light the story of a medical doctor and PhD biochemist named Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski. After hearing about the harassment and lawsuits Dr. Burzynski endured over the past two decades, Eric signed on to direct and produce a full-length film highlighting the unbelievable perseverance and determination Dr. Burzynski had to stand up for the patients he had helped beat their cancer without the use of chemotherapy. You must watch this film to gain an appreciation for the man behind this miracle cancer-fighting treatment.

In this DVD, Eric Merola tells the story of Dr. Burzynski in compelling language and discusses:

- The incredible discovery Dr. Burzynski found to treat cancer
- Why nobody has paid attention to Dr. Burzynski's story before
- How this documentary shows abundant proof
- Why Dr. Burzynski remained defiant against his detractors
- How he was able to leave Poland with $15 and his peptide discovery
- The meticulous record-keeping methodology used by Dr. Burzynski
- Why the fight isn't over because Phase 2 of his study is complete
- How the government tried to steal his idea for treating cancer
- The promotion of the benefits of Antineoplastons for cancer patients

You really owe it to yourself to watch this film and decide for yourself whether you think Dr. Burzynski is a hero or a goat. I'm convinced he's a hero who is deserving of the Nobel Prize in science someday soon.",1322611200,2,1738,4.884745762711864

4215473,5,B003X3CF68,I went to see this movie after a good freind of mine was treated and saved by Dr. Burzynski.  I had no idea any of this was going on while she was in treatment. After seeing the moving I am amazed that the FDA and Texas Government is trying to stop a man who is making miracles happen and with no side effects.  My friend had a brain tumor and went though the treatment for 2 years and now has been cancer free for 2 years.  And during this treatment she had NO side effects.  With chemo she was sick all this the time.  When cemotherapy and radiation failed this man was there to save her life.  I would recommand this clinic to anyone and everyone should watch this movie and help fight to get the FDA and Government to leave Burzynski alone and let him continue to cure lives.  Without him my friend may not have been here today along with many others who are fighting cancer.  Pharmaceutical companies rather make money off drugs that fail with horrible side effects than one that has been proven to work time after time.  Please take time and watch the movie and fight for Burzynski!!,1321920000,3,1089,4.325123152709359
4215494,5,B003X3CF68,"Dr. Lee Cowden saved my son's life. Cowden was harrassed by the state board in Texas much like Dr. Burzynski until he moved to Phoenix and eventually established residence in Panama.

Undiagnosed Lyme disease with co-infections and mercury toxicity almost killed my son.  His weight dropped from 150 lbs to 98 lbs. Dr. Lee Cowden cured him and is curing terminal patients and putting serious chronic diseases in remission, much like Dr. Burzynski. There is life saving natural medicine out there, folks, but it is being withheld from the sick and dying.

Jack was in his 20's in 1991, He had always been healthy, industrious, full of life and enthusiasm, but, began to not feel well and started seeing doctors and having test to rule out conditions but nothing significant was found. He was spiraling downward into disability without a diagnosis to the point that I moved in with him as a caretaker and after seeing many doctors in our state we traveled to Mayo Clinic in Minnesota or anywhere we had a shred of hope for improvement.

Conventional Medicine was making Jack worse and personally insulting him. They used nuclear medical testing that made him worse and only offered drugs and psychriatric counseling.  He was suffering and we were desperate. Psychoanalysis labeled him as a malingerer.(pretends to be ill to avoid work)

 We heard about an Environmental Clinic in Dallas, Tx so we were there off and on for several years and eventually got a diagnosis of Lyme disease. He got better doing Dr. Rae's sauna detoxification program but reached a plateau still disabled.  Dr. Rae put him on IV nutrition thru a shunt in his chest that brought his weight back up to 150 lbs.  It saved Jack's life but he was still not well.

We were fortunate to come in contact with Dr. Lee Cowden in Dallas by Jack participating in a Lyme study about ten years ago.

Dr. Cowden is an MD and practiced Cardiology for many years before turning to natural medicine to cure a serious personal health issue and has practiced Natural Medicine ever since.

Thru the years we noticed that we would lose access to natural supplements that were really helping Jack. You just couldn't get it anymore. It was suspicious. But, there are so many new ones becoming available all the time that it would be difficult to shut down all of them.  Other countries are far ahead of the U.S. in producing these vital supplements and giving their people access.

Dr. Burzynski and Dr. Cowden are not giving up. They and their patients are taking on the dirty dealing double talking
entities in this country who don't care how many people die as long as they keep hearing the KaChing!!!

My son is well. He can run 10 miles and plans to enter a marathon. He is a certified Naturopathic Practioner in Arizona. He enjoyed playing in a band before he got sick and has been playing in a band for the past couple of years. At 97 lbs he made funeral plans. What kind of person would purposely withhold lifesaving treatment from the suffering and dying?

Its good to know information on how the FDA tries to put people with an actual CURE out of business and in jail for life! Good thing the supreme court did not put the Dr. into prison and thanks to all of the real people who stopped this from happening. If more people watched this movie, not only do I believe we could save lives, but people will begin to open their eyes to the government and how it is run.

He may be the key to the biggest breakthrough in the fight against cancer yet. Unfortunately by also being the inventor and solely patent holder of this new non-toxic cancer treatment, he is now faced with a legal battle as challenging as cancer itself against the FDA, NCI and multibillion pharmaceutical companies who will not sit and tolerate any serious threat to their profits. All the negative reviews focus on the heavy amount of transcripts and medical records that are presented as a way to say it is boring yet for me it was precisely what I needed to see in order to believe that Dr Burzynski is a credible and a serious person who is indeed bringing amazing results to patients once doomed to a terrible prognosis by regular treatment methods. It is a serious documentary focusing on an important issue, there will be evidence presented to support it. In fact there is a whole website that continues to follow Dr Burzynski's struggle.

After seeing the movie I asked my doctor here in Florida about Dr. Burzynski. He told me he referred a patient to Dr. Burzynski in Huston, TX for a grade 4 astryocytoma aggressive brain tumor for a 12 year old nephew of his friend who was told he only had 4 weeks to live and no reason to even try chemo or radiation. Long story short: That 12 year old kid is now 40 years old. Completely cured. This isn't a single case, many cases. His treatments are not a 100% cure, but far better than chemo or radiation. In some types only 25% success rates, but even in these cancers chemeo and radiation treatments only getting 1% cure rates. Also, no serious side effects. I know I would go to him if I got cancer. I went to the white house web site and signed the petetion that was started by his patients to put pressure on the Obama administration to help get his drugs available for patients with cancer to use if they wish.",1320105600,4,1045,4.225
4215499,5,B003X3CF68,"When I saw the reviews for this film, I thought, ""oh dear, some mental case documentarian has swindled a bunch of people about another quack"". I mean, the word ""wellness"" makes me cringe with all these people who worship pseudo science. Still, I had never seen so many consistently positive reviews for ANYTHING on Amazon, outside perhaps of George R. R. Martin's ""Game of Thrones""...oh and Atlas Shrugged (joking).

In fact, this film is an indictment and the greatest argument one could possibly make against BIG Government in ALL its forms. The FDA must be one of the most evil organizations to have ever existed. Nevermind whether this doctor was or was not a ""quack"", and it seems that he was far from that. Actually, it seems that he may have cured or invented rather, a cure for cancer. The key importance of this film is to show the evil of Statist philosophy at work in the USA. It is a bleak reminder that we are living in that 1984...it has come to pass.

If Jefferson was still alive, this movie alone would have sparked a revolution.

Pharmaceutical firms are not the enemy here, although clearly the people at the FDA have destroyed the free market in medicine. Big Pharma has become the enemy, forced to be the enemy by the Government. And doctors are all criminals...when they use their brains to discover new and impossible cures.

In this case, we're talking about people who had zero options. And even then--prevented from saving themselves by the same people who would force a woman to give birth...oh yes...this is the same philosophy at work. The idea that Government owns your body. And it does!

I will not try and say what has already been said better. Just watch this film. If you want to know what is destroying your world...what made Nazi Germany and Communist Russia possible...it is right here, in your Government, and it's already won half the battle. Not just that man must live for the state, but that we must sacrifice reason, our reason and facts...to the power and emotional impotence of bureaucrats.

I'll leave you with a quote from the book I mention above...which hated as it is...demonstrates and predicted the very thing that is now happening, about 50 years ago.

""Did you really think that we want those laws to be observed? We want them broken. You'd better get it straight that it's not a bunch of boy scouts you're up against . . . We're after power and we mean it. You fellows were pikers, but we know the real trick, and you'd better get wise to it. There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted.] - and you create a nation of law-breakers - and then you cash in on guilt. Now that's the system, Mr. Rearden, and once you understand it, you'll be much easier to deal with.""",1320019200,3,3132,4.6122082585278275

My sister died this year from cancer and was treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston (where Dr. Burzynski practices).  To my knowledge she was never told about antineoplastons.  My sister died of complications of radiation therapy and not from her cancer.

The film is entirely one sided, and the reviews here, on Netflix, and elsewhere on the internet are primarily, as far as I can tell, from shills.

The calls to disband the FDA frankly defy any logical explanation.  Even if everything in the film were true, that would be an extremely dangerous response - cutting off your nose to spite your face.

Burzynski's ""statistics,"" as presented in the film have not been independently verified or replicated.  He charges obscene amounts of money for this unproven treatment, taking advantage of those most desperate.

This same doctor (Burzynski) is behind another unproven ""treatment"" called Aminocare - used to treat wrinkles that sells for $120 per box.  It is backed by the same type of pseudo-scientific research claims and ""testimonials.""

I could go on and on, but the more I learn, the more I am convinced the guy is simply out to make a quick buck preying on people's insecurities and desperation.  It is truly despicable.  And what's worse, there is clearly some sort of PR firm attempting to control the message available online with Burzynski ""supporters"" who fail to use reason.  Burzynski wants you to think there is some mass conspiracy against him, but in reality, he is the one orchestrating a conspiracy.  Based on all the fake reviews, I now wouldn't even be surprised to learn that some of the patient testimonials were fabricated.

It blasts big pharma company and portray a picture of corruption in the action of FDA by taking money from the companies that it regulates.  However, the film fail to recongnize that Burzynski Institute itself is a pharma company that synthesize alternative medicine.  Thus, it also takes money from the Burzynski Institute.  It sounds more like a disgruntle employee lashing out on its big boss, the FDA.

This movie is one sided and it fails to mention that 4% of patients using the antineoplaston treatment died during the treatment. Also, numerous prominent oncology doctors reviewed the treatment procedure and found that this treatment contain toxic level of sodium (salt), which was claimed in the movie that the treatment is ""none toxic"".  As to the claim that this treatment actually cure the patients, that claim itself is a mix bag.  Majority of the patients had undergo ""Special exceptions"" by the FDA, which means that the patients had already undergo some type of preliminary treatment from somewhere else and Burzynski's treatment is secondary treatment.  It is hard to verify if his treatment actually worked or it is from the previous treatment. Finally his unwarranted ""I can cure any cancer""  approach makes me wonder if he is really after the money or the well being of the patients, especially when the treatment ""might"" have an effect only on a portion of his patients.

As mentioned in the movie, big pharma is about earning money.  Woudn't every big pharma company want to gain an advantage over ther competitor by buying Burzynski's company if his drug is so effective?  If his treatment is so effective on ""every"" cancer, why wouldn't any big pharmaceutical company just offer a irrefusable large sum of money to buy him out instead of ganging up on him and trying to shut him up?

I could not care less about the bottom line of pharmaceutical companies, and would be thrilled to learn about any successful treatments for cancers with poor prognoses.

That said, I found this documentary to be extremely one-sided.  It tugged at the heartstrings by showing parents of children with deadly cancer diagnoses with no options, and showed that these children were living cancer free a number of years later.  However, there was no balance.  While no claim was made that the treatment was 100% effective (rather, effectiveness stats presented were still low - but higher than traditional treatment), the case studies presented were clearly cherry picked.  As it is said, the plural of anecdote is not data.

I also found the claims against Dr. Burzynski to be poorly articulated.  At one point, it was mentioned that there were 75 counts brought against him (most of which were ultimately dropped), but it was never explained what these counts were.  I do believe that regulators like the FDA can be biased, but I don't believe they are completely irrational and vindictive, which is how the film made them appear.  The argument of the other side was never fleshed out, and therefore I had no ability to fairly evaluate it as a viewer.  It left me feeling the filmmakers were trying to brush unsavory facts under the rug.  They put up a straw-man and knocked him right down.

Speaking of the filmmakers, I would have liked to see an explanation for how they were funded and how they got interested in the story.  Were they approaching the subject from an independent perspective, or did they have a horse in the race?

Finally, what I was also left questioning was why, if this treatment is so miraculous, have no independent researchers been able to replicate Burzynski's findings?  At one point in the documentary, an independent antineoplaston trial shown in the film looked like it was being conducted with diluted drug and in incorrect doses.  I fully understand why that study didn't work.  But if I'm going to believe that this is a treatment that's worth spending my hard-earned money on if, heaven forbid, I am ever faced with a cancer it purportedly can treat, I need to see Dr. Burzynski's statistics replicated.  From what I can tell, that's never been done (across a variety of studies - not just the flawed one presented) - and that's extremely alarming.

I would love nothing more than to see Dr. Burzynski's treatment work.  However, this documentary left me feeling like I had not heard the full story.",1318809600,29,2701,4.892307692307693

When and how does a person reach the point where monetary value, selfish pride and lust for power not only outweigh but cause the suffering and torture of another human being, especially a child. Is it mental illness or just plain evil? I would probably vote for the latter, though I see how one stubbornly clinging to the delusion they have all the answers and setting out to deliberately destroy new knowledge and the bearer of such could be a sign of mental illness.

But it takes two hours to present the evidence, and the evidence presented is very convincing, made all the more so because in the end the powers arrayed against Dr. Burzynski demonstrate that (a) they believe that his injections do cure certain cancers and (b) they would like to profit from its sale. These powers include the Food and Drug Administration while it was headed by David Kessler, whose persecution included twice assembling Grand Juries in attempts to indict Dr. Burzynski. The facts prevailed in these two instances, and Dr. Burzyski prevailed against other attempts to besmirch him, but this was at great cost. This movie won't make you happy, but it tells you things you will want to know. You don't have to watch it to learn about a terrible injustice being done (You can do that by reading almost any day's news.), but you should know about this one because it shows what the agency charged with protecting your health has done to possibly endanger it.",1318118400,5,1181,4.737864077669903
4215539,5,B003X3CF68,"I watched this movie on the advice of Dr. Mercola at [...], who is an advocate for a life free of chemicals or artificial anything. I knew when I was younger that they had found a cure for cancer, I was overjoyed but did not know why. Now, I am angry at the government, because no less than 7 of my immediate family have or have recently passed away from cancer. This is a very in depth look at the truth what our government is hiding, they will continue to hide. The sad fact is that the people are not listening. Some are mindless drones to another corrupt industry, wireless. This is because you cannot multitask and pay attention at the same time. I thank Dr. Mercola for bringing to my attention the fight that is going on behind the scenes for the overtake of our individual health and welfare.

It is the individual that chooses to take or not to take the medicine given to them, it is not the job of the government to choose who does or does not choose who lives or dies, the first rule of medicine in any humane field is humanity itself, not to hurt, lie or maim the patient that they are treating, Dr. Burzynski wants no harm to any patient, this is the same with atomic bomb, everyone who seen that effect wish it was never invented. To some extent it is different here, but not much, the whole world has been waiting for a cure, but greed is stopping it? That itself is inhumane.

After seeing this film, I will NEVER again donate a penny to ANY Cancer fundraising organization, not breast cancer or lung cancer or prostate cancer or even brain cancer, even though most of my family is or has passed away suffering the effects of thing like chemo, (do they really know what its like to watch your mother die from chemo, hours after the treatment? I don't think so) all they want is money, for what? To find a cure? They have the cure!!

I have a number of documentary-type DVD's on the subject of America's ""PHARMA"" controversy, which includes the doctors, the hospitals, health insurance, the FDA, congress and powerful cancer research support groups.  They all play critical roles in efforts to shut down or totally ignore Dr. Burzinski, his medical genius and his long-term ""fight"" for justice, truth and proven alternatives to cancer research and treatment.

My only disappointment is the need for a more current updated DVD.  Obviously the DVD in this review needed to tell the whole story - this plight is medical history (REAL DOCUMENTATION) and had to go back to Burzinski's medical beginnings to really reveal the whole picture.  Now, I would buy an updated DVD immediately.

Trust the FDA, American Cancer Society, ""BIG PHARMA"", your doctor's directions and all the large associations who raise zillions for cancer research - who give generously toward the fight for ""THE CURE""?  You will feel differently - and feel shame and disgust for America's treatment of this Doctor and his goals. Buy it TODAY!

I frankly believe that the FDA, the NCI and Dr. Samid should be criminally prosecuted for their actions clearly laid out in this film.

It would be one thing if all the film showed was criminal activity on the part of the American government... I guess we're all kind of used to that these days.

But the immense tragedy is the many, many lives that will be lost to cancer because of the limitations the FDA/NCI have applied to Dr. Burzynski's protocols... and the fact that the FDA/NCI have required chemo to be conducted in conjunction with Burzynski's protocols (which in and of themselves have no side effects).

And it is NOT for the American public.  This film is about a doctor who discovered a cure for cancer (YES, a cure for cancer!).  And how the TX medical board along with the FDA tried to discredit and suppress his work.  But in the end it shows how some of his own colleagues along with the gov't tried to steal his discovery.  It is an amazing film detailing Dr. Burzynski's battles with the government.  And such an eye opener to what is going on with the FDA and the National Cancer Institute.  Wouldn't you think if someone found a cure for cancer that these two organizations would happily jump for joy?? Nope, this is not what they are about. They are about just treating the symptoms, not CURING! It is sad that our health industry is all about money and PROFITS. And there are thousands of people out there dying of cancer every year.

Thank God for Dr. Burzynski who has fought court battles after court battles for decades defending his discovery.  He stands for what is right and ethical in our corrupt health industry.  He never wavered in his fight and never backed down from the bullies from some of the top officials in our government.  Dr. Burzynski does not receive public funds for his research.

Every hard-working, tax-paying American should see this to know the lengths to which Big Pharma, with the help of the FDA, will go to quash anything that doesn't line their pockets--even a cure for cancer!!!  I so admire Dr. Burzynski for his perseverance, and Dr. Merola for getting this documentary out to the public.  I've often wondered why, after all these decades of cancer research and billions (or trillions?) of dollars in contributions no one has yet discovered a cure for cancer.  I'm now convinced it is simply--and immorally--because the pharmaceutical companies make billions on new poisons they consistently invent and market as ""chemotherapy drugs"" and they know they will lose massive amounts of revenue and profits if a cure is actually found.  It will be a very long time before I contribute any more of my hard-earned dollars to ""cancer research"" through customary channels.

This DVD is shocking and eye-opening, yet hopeful as well.

Billions upon billions have been poured into all the organizations supposedly looking for cures - ie - Jerry Lewis Telethon - how many people do we know who've been cured of MD?  It's obvious after polio was cured, pharmaceutical companies and MD's were realizing far less profits which would cause speculation that nobody in the industries wanted anything else cured.

This superb documentary clearly lays out the story with an astounding amount of ""smoking gun"" evidence.  For me, this is no surprise (regarding the corruption in the medical industry), but all too many people still believe the fabrications of so-called public health ""experts"" and industry associations who cynically abuse their positions of public trust for personal gain and to perpetuate their own power, prestige, influence and authority, at the expense of the health and lives of innocents.  Outrage is too mild a word to describe my reaction on seeing this film.  Importantly, the movie takes an even and factual tone in presenting very compelling and voluminous body of damning evidence.

More movie facts: The FDA frivolously indicts Dr. Burzynski 6 times over 10 years, sabotages his clinical trials and publishes a smear study to discredit his treatment, invades patient's privacy by subpoenaing their private medical records leaving the doctor unable to treat them, slanders his good name repeatedly by contacting all those who do business with him influencing them and others to stay away from any business dealings with him.  Even 2 congressmen accuse the FDA of harassment, but FDA ultimately wins the 7th indictment and prosecutes him, and loses the case --spending $52 million in taxpayer money and leaving cancer patients to die in the meantime (that doesn't count the many millions of public money spent over three decades to harass the doctor!).  The National Cancer Institute tried to steal his innovations and patent them as their own during the time period where they joined with the FDA to sue him and distract his energies and money toward defending prolonged legal suits rather than protecting his patented treatments!

This is a must see about how one man is trying to Cure Cancer and none of the previous entities want him to because there is more money in people dying from cancer while pumping them full of poison and radiation. He has found a NON Toxic way to help people survive some of the worst cancers we have seen. If you want to donate money to help fight cancer is should be to Dr. Burzynski NOT the National Cancer Institute or Susan G Koeman. They are not trying to cure cancer they are just making money.

Its no surprise that psychopaths and sociopaths are the ones who are most attracted to this industry.  A person who enjoys sickness and death would feel right at home in medicine.  The history of medicine is a horror story.  From arsenic laden medicine, to blood letting, to spreading horrible diseases due to unsanitary medical devices.

Until the 20th century, draining a patients blood was the preferred treatment for the common cold as well as other diseases.  This is beleived to be the cause of death for our first president George Washington.  We now know blood letting has zero medical benefits and only causes harm to the patient.  It took thousands of years to figure that out.

As this movie states, until recent times doctors never washed their hands or used clean medical devices to perform surgeries or operations.  It will never be known how many people died as a result.  It is no wonder that doctors always amputated the limbs they worked on.",1308009600,5,1055,4.9375

The American government has been open for business and up for purchase since the 60s, and we've been long since owned by corporate America for some time.

What is amazing is that there were a few good Congressmen not yet owned by corporate America that helped, to some extent; and that the Dr. survived the continued harassment from the Pharma owned FDA.

I love this from the move, ""There is nothing sacred under the capatilist sun"", said by the former NIH scientist commenting on their style.

I'm a bit disillusioned.  So many people hold so much credence in science, and here we see, YET AGAIN, a corporate influenced falsification of peer-reviewed scientific documents.  Truly, there is nothing sacred in this 'great' country any longer.

Our only recourse as a people are to be educated and to question everything.  Do you really wonder why the U.S. govt is stopping funding of education, why states cut education first?  Because an uneducated populous are much easier to deceive and sway than an educated populous.  Do whatever you can to learn as much as you can while you can.

Google search 'scientists under attack' to get to the DVD documentary; we see that BP with a 500 MILLION dollar grant to UC Berkley in exchange to WRITE CURRICULUM.  Get educated while you can before they control what you learn as well.

There may be another way, but we're not going to find it if won't give new ideas a fair trial.

4215648,5,B003X3CF68,"I'm pleased to see Burzynski's story told so well.

Burzynski has been the victim of a series of scandalous attacks over the last three decades. This movie tells the story in an compelling fashion.

Really top notch. Very impressive. This movie could change things.",1307923200,5,265,5.0
4215649,4,B003X3CF68,"I saw this movie online. The Burzynski documentary is fascinating and includes the testimony of quite a few patients, and includes many documents.

The primary contention is that Burzynski came up with a new treatment  for cancer and was persecuted by the FDA for administering a treatment unapproved by the FDA that helped 25% of the patients and wasn't toxic. By contrast the chemotherapies normally recommended are toxic and aren't effective.
There is a great line - ""[our doctor told us] there's no evidence that that [Burzynski's treatment] worked... Well yours doesn't really work either."" 26:10

This said the movie could be a little clearer as to the FDA's position. One thing they don't do is explain standards of proof. (Read ""Stanislaw Burzynski and ""Antineoplastons"" by Saul Green, Ph. D.)
The problem is that there's no evidence he's doing this scientifically. He's just doing something that seems to work - that doesn't make it scientific.
I read elsewhere -
"" ""When fair-minded clinical investigators independently conclude that data are worthless, two options seem available: withdraw antineoplaston therapy from public use, or develop new protocols in conjunction with experts in clinical trials,"" said Barrie Cassileth, a psychosocial oncologist and author of The Alternative Medicine Handbook. ""
As a Judge pointed out, there seems to be no evidence that Burzynski's treatment isn't safe or effective. The problem is that the evidence is all anecdotal and doesn't conform to FDA and other rules of scientific evidence.
What isn't clear is - what are those rules and why doesn't Burzynski simply comply with them and get approved? It seems quite possible he simply doesn't understand them. Or maybe the filmmakers needed to more clearly explain why it was impossible to do so. If compliance was impossible it needs to be explained. Apparently many people found his Phase II trials to be insufficient.

This still doesn't explain though his persecution. So who care if he's not scientific?
The problem is that the state licenses medical practices - and non-scientific medical practices are generally politically unpopular, although they've gained a lot of ground. This appears to be in part an ideological battle. Supporters of science based medicine want to use the state to crush non-scientific medical practices, and basically to define medicine as only practices that fit in to a scientific paradigm. Just because something sometimes work and causes no harm is not good enough. I think some people honestly can't tell from his research if some people are harmed, why some withdraw, etc. There's no scientific data.
This isn't too say that the pharma companies in reality have great evidence - but they are better able to fit in to the dominant paradigm.
At any rate about minute 54:05 they make it clear that ""Issue isn't safety or efficacy. It is that it hasn't been proven by controlled clinical trials.""
This is important - the problem is the lack of controlled clinical trials. His work is outside the scientific paradigm. He's being prosecuted/persecuted for that.

Was the problem that they couldn't raise financing? Seems like many other people can do that.
Patent protection is key. Elan doesn't want to invest in something that isn't patentable.
Similarly though Burzynski seems very protective over his patents. It's not clear if he's willing to share rewards and take in partners.
The case could well be though that no firms believe trials can be done and a patentable product created that will sell. But seeing how Burzynski has a business employing quite a few highly skilled people, it seems extraordinarily short sighted to think his business couldn't expand.

Particularly disturbing is that they seem to provide a lot of evidence that the National Cancer Institute study didn't follow the protocols Burzynski and they agreed  to. Not surprisingly the new protocol failed to produce positive results. It isn't clear why they couldn't recruit more people when Burzynski has lots of potential people for his trials.
It was ironic that the US government tries to patent his work at the same time the FDA is suing him.

They also mention Ignaz Semmelweis. Semmelweis is a classic example of how the scientific paradigm can shut out clear empirical evidence. As Wikipedia says -
""Some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and Semmelweis could offer no acceptable scientific explanation for his findings.""
The irony is that while his theory of transmission of disease seemed unscientific, today we don't comprehend what they considered scientific theories.
People had no concept of a disease being the outcome of living things growing inside the body. This required the 'germ theory' - disease 'sprouts' from a 'germ' or seed.
Disease was seen as chemical / physical - dosage was important just as with poison. The idea that touching a dead body would create a disease, especially the body of a person un-diseased at death, seemed magical. How could an invisible piece of matter affect the whole body?
Semmelweis didn't have a scientific explanation, and one wasn't available until Pasteur.
Now we know about germs, and empirical evidence for the seeming magical deadliness invisibly small quantities of material is an argument in favor of the germ theory, but at the time Semmelwies' ideas didn't seem scientific.

If Burzynski isn't able to fit in to the scientific paradigm we can expect problems with acceptance. However the state licensure system and patents makes things worse by preventing free use of his treatments.

We should note that there are some significant problems with his treatment if Burzynski and other researchers aren't scientific.
If other people can't replicate his results that's a serious failing.
What if he's doing something else during his treatment that helps people?
I also wonder why isn't the body of someone with cancer naturally producing anti-neplastons?",1307923200,7,5959,5.178608515057113

4215680,5,B003X3CF68,"Whenever I tell someone that our government and health care agencies do not want a cure for cancer unless they can benefit from it financially, I'm accused of being a conspiracy theorist. Those unfamiliar with the corruption in health care just cannot believe cancer cures are being suppressed. You'll be convinced after watching this remarkably informative documentary about Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski.

Burzynski is a biochemist who discovered peptides called antineoplasts that are abundant in healthy people and completely lacking in those with cancer. He developed a protocol for extracting these peptides from the urine of healthy people and injecting them into people with cancer, which in many cases led to complete remission of the cancer--with no side effects. He later was able to synthesize it and holds a patent on his treatment.

Dr. Burzynski has been ridiculed and attacked for his discovery. The Texas Board of Medical Examiners, the FDA, the National Cancer Institute, a pharmaceutical company and a former consultant have conspired to take away his medical license, disrupt his practice, brand him as a quack, throw him in jail, and steal his patent. His office has been raided and patient files have been confiscated, disrupting Burzynski's treatment of very ill people. Millions of tax dollars have been spent by the FDA in its attempt to imprison Burzynski.

They haven't persecuted Burzynski because his treatment doesn't work or because it is harmful. They're persecuting him because it does work, and they want it. Their charge is that he shipped it across state lines to his patients, to other scientists investigating his cure, and for use in FDA clinical trials. And while pharmaceutical companies receive tax monies for their research and can get drugs approved in a mere three to four months, Burzynski receives nothing and has tried for decades to get his treatment approved by the FDA. All while paying millions to defend himself in court.

Dr. Julian Whitaker summed up very well the sad state of affairs, ""How could the U.S. Patent Office be corrupted to the point that they issue patents on medical therapies that have already been patented and issue them to someone who had nothing to do with their discovery or use? And how could the Patent Office then assign fraudulent patents to some of the most powerful institutions in American government? And imagine, all of this was being done while these same government agencies were spending billions of the taxpayers' dollars trying to put Dr. Burzynski in jail so that he could not fight the criminal theft of his discovery. Well, what about the ten million patients who died of cancer over the last twenty years? The majority of them could have been saved if the government had not blocked the therapy that they knew could save them.""

In Burzynksi, the Movie, you'll hear from Dr. Burzynski, Dr. Julian Whitaker, Congressional members, and former cancer patients. The testimonies of Burzynski's patients are heartbreaking, because all they want to know is, ""Why are you trying to take this away from us?"" And just when I thought the movie was ending, another segments began with more unbelievable corruption. I was completely disgusted and outraged by what I learned.

My hat is off to Eric Merola for producing a documentary that is informative, entertaining, engrossing, heartbreaking, and infuriating. There's not a dull moment, and I wish everyone on the planet would watch this. Then maybe, maybe something might be done about the stranglehold the FDA and PhARMA have on preventing the advance of health care so that it actually heals people.

I viewed this film at a film festival and none of the audience expressed any doubts about the incidents presented and the efforts of the FDA to in fact steal the Burzinski patents.
