7904847,1,B000006QKE,"The greatness of Josip Broz Tito was never captured in this biography mainly due to the US affliction with anything socialist being evil or bad. If you are thinking of getting a proper appraisal of the life of Tito, then DON'T buy this one. Total rubbish.",1390435200,2,255,4.565217391304348
7904848,5,B000006QKE,"The biography of Yugoslavian leader Josip Broz Tito could have been presented in many different ways, taking into account different literary portrayals of this truly great statesman of the 20th century.  There is no doubt that Tito had a multitude of enemies, but the number of his friends was even greater.

I was a child when Tito died, but I witnessed the truly heartwrenching outpour of grief among common people of Yugoslavia - from Slovenia in the Northwest, to Macedonia in the Southeast (or as a Yugoslavian song says, From Vardar to Triglav, From Djerdap to the Adriatic).  I will never forget that stunning sight.  It is that much more sad that Tito has been much maligned by the radical nationalists, and even more sad that the common people who once cried for him now rejected the memory of him.

Tito is often portrayed as a communist - there is no doubt that he was the leader of the Yugoslavian communist party.  But above all, Tito was a nationalist, fighting for the southern Slav peoples of the Balkan peninsula.  Not many Westerners know that Tito never allowed Stalin to absorb Yugoslavia into his Eastern Bloc, or Warsaw Pact.  Tito, along with Nehru and Nasser, was the founder of the Non-Aligned Movement.

The world, not just Yugoslavia, lost a great man on May 4th, 1980 at 3:05pm, when Tito succumbed to illness in a hospital in Ljubljana, Slovenia, just short of his 88th birthday.  The world needs more leaders like him, leaders who truly strive to unite and spread peace.  So, indeed, may he rest in peace.",1176854400,7,1535,4.7330827067669174
7904849,5,B000006QKE,"Very short and concise overview of the life and history of Josip Broz Tito, one of the most important leaders of the 20th century.  The film consists of some great narrative and wonderful film pieces from Tito's life.  Recommended for anyone wanting a good visual history of this great leader.",1173312000,2,293,4.84
7904850,5,B000006QKE,"One of the people who influenced XX century most was certainly Josip Broz Tito. Loved by her friends and common jugoslav folk at least as much as hated by his enemies, this charismatic figure have chosen his way between  superpowers to get the most for his people and himself. Description of him  as a communist leader and dictator who made a major contribution for fall  of communism is certainly quite true.
Putting someone's 88 years long  life into 50 minutes biography, A&E mastered just fine. This biography  should be seen by everybody, people who didn't know him, people who hated  him, people who loved him, people who just lived under his rule, like  myself. Everybody may find elements to support his feelings about Tito and  this is why A&E did great job, too. One fact is not to doubt by anyone  who knew about Tito: he was one of the greatest politicians of XX century.
A&E showed what is material the legends are made of.",962236800,2,936,4.624242424242424
