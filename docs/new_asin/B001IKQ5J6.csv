8311043,5,B001IKQ5J6,"Great DVD, it has some great matches with Matt Sydal/Evan Bourne. I hope he will be given more performance freedom in WWE that he shows in here soon, as his matches on the DVD are much better than his WWE matches thus far. Hopefully this is just a prelude to a great WWE DVD for him one day.",1321833600,,291,4.0344827586206895
8311044,4,B001IKQ5J6,I enjoyed the product. It Just makes me sad to see someone with great talent not be used to his potential today. I like how it offered options. I can watch matches as they were seen on television or all the raw footage.,1306108800,,219,4.116279069767442
