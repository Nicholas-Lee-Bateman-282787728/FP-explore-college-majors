8411160,2,B003ZWIIRW,"I just watched this DVD before giving it to my 5 year old grandson, who LOVES space and rockets and astronauts.  He wanted to know what the real ones look like, sound like, et cetera.  This DVD sounded like it was made to order for the purpose, but they have missed the mark, in my opinion.  It is filled with technical terms.  There are long stretches of things like the surface of the moon, astronauts floating, rockets in space, set to classical music.  The fact that each section is introduced by a cute little yellow talking airplane doesn't help much. There is little narration of the videos themselves.  On a positive note, they did not include any flights which resulted in death, in case you were wondering. If you are old enough to remember hearing on TV, ""Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero, ingition, WE HAVE LIFT-OFF!!!"",  you will probably be disappointed, because you will not hear that in this video.  Just the numbers, not the whole countdown.  If I had only known, I would have returned it unopenned.",1288137600,,1047,4.646739130434782
