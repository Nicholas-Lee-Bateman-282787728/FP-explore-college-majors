He movies are Great and I am looking for his movie called the Body disappears which I just saw on TCM.  I laungh so hard,  It sadden me you don't have it.  Have to check with TCM I guess.

He also team up with another ld time great which I have been looking for her movies but saddly I do not recall her name only her nickname.  They called her hourseface.  She was great too.
Wish they had great movies like their today.  What they call funny today makes me sick.

Anyway, if anyone knows where I can get this movie please let me know.",1268870400,,650,4.015625
