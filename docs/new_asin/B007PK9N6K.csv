8520423,5,B007PK9N6K,"Honestly enough said if you are a fan of this group; calling all Anne Rice fans!!!!!! This band never dissappoints the concert is great nearly two hours also the live CD includes three new tracks but they have really upped the ante for this tour they have an amazing live sound and this live DVD/Cd is much better than their last one Desire of Damnation, there is a thick booklet inside of tour photography, mainly of the gorgeous Sonya Scarlet, she's a damn good vocalist! But its a wonderful booklet, and it has the lyrics to the new songs they recorded for Cult of Lamia, gorgeous bonus tracks that I hope are a reflection of the new album to come, because I surely cannot wait for more music from this outstanding band. So if you are a fan of TDV this is a must have it doesnt' disappoint!",1369785600,,793,4.364864864864865
8520424,4,B007PK9N6K,"Ok, so I now own both DVD's from TDV, The first DVD ""The Addiction Tour"" was good enough for me to get this one. This DVD is so much better in production, nicely presented in widescreen, sound is good but in 2.0, in todays modern age most concert DVD's are in 5.1 surround. I love the orchestration of TDV as it is very gothic and melodic. The only thing that irritates me is Sonya's vocal style. Before I further explain, understand that I never owned any albums from TDV and hadn't heard any of there music till I got there first DVD. There first DVD being only 45 minutes long, Sonya's vocals didn't really bother me cause I was enjoying the music and concert was short for me to even notice her vocal style. Well, with this DVD you get a longer concert, which is good, but Sonya's singing style really irritated me. Up to this point of writing my review, I've only watched an hour of the concert so far, and not from one viewing. Sonya is pretty to look at, but to me she sounds like an 80 year old singing in a very good gothic band. This is a very good DVD, and I do enjoy the music, I just don't like Sonya's singing. I'm sure I'll hear it from TDV fans, but hey...I'm being honest.",1366502400,,1189,4.1965065502183405
