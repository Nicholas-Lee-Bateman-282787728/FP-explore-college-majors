8237631,1,B0010BCE20,"this film is so horrendously made and slack-jawed yolkalled it clocks in at less then 50 min!!
this film looks like it cost $.10 cents to make. i wish i had not bought it!! i threw my copy in the trash
and kept the keepcase box as a back-up. if you want real pot cinema just stick to the cheech and chong films, after all, they are the masters of the genre.",1330732800,,357,3.9722222222222223
