8220105,5,B000VUHDB8,"I love this dvd. It works, you see results fast and if you want a more challenge then buy the Bikini Ready Workout DVD as well, that is more intense and offers much more cardio.",1369094400,,177,4.085714285714285
8220106,5,B000VUHDB8,"Excellent tape for an hour of toning, and exercises all body muscles. Use 3 times a week and what a difference in your body strength. Use 2 lb. or 5 lb. weights!!!! Michelle R.N.",1274832000,,178,4.264705882352941
8220107,5,B000VUHDB8,I first did this Video on Comcast On Demand. I was able to get it from Amazon cheaper then buying from the place Comcast suggested. I really enjoy doing this video. Its set at a great pace. You can feel the burn but it doesn't kill you. Lauren's moves and side comments are hysterical. I give it 5 stars! :),1249948800,,307,4.133333333333334
8220108,2,B000VUHDB8,"First of all, I had a really hard time taking the workout seriously. The leader, Lauren Jones, tries too hard to be cute and comes off cheesy (I guess this is somewhat expected because its' Baywatch). She blows kisses, frequently mentions thongs and lingerie,does a ""booty dance"" between lunges, and often refers to adjusting herself because of ""wardrobe malfunctions"".  However, she demonstrates every move with proper form before having the viewer perform it, and seems sincere and doesn't come off like an airhead the entire time. The music could just possibly be the worst workout music ever-very drab guitar stuff.  She has a few unique variations on some basic moves, but there is nothing too imaginative or new here.

I think the main problem with this workout is that is confused about its' target audience. It's not really a beginner workout, because of all the jogging (that begins in the warm-up) but it does not perform enough reps of any of the strength moves to really challenge the intermediate or advanced exerciser. There is generally 10-15 reps of each move and she uses light weights. So it is probably best for the advanced beginner. You need weights and a mat for this workout. You can always mark in place if you want to make this low impact and use heavier weights to make it more of a challenge. She looks like she is using 3-lb weights, but that's not really much of anything.

The DVD is divided into several sections named with a lifeguard motif in mind. The sections can be done together or individually. The first section, ""Rescue Shapes"" focuses on lower body toning (squats, lunges, knee raises) and intersperses the strength moves with jogging in place. Then there is the ""Swimming"" section, where you focus on shoulder toning using light weights. Next, the ""Resuscitation"" section is a combination of push-ups, tricep kickbacks and chest flies. The ""Surfing"" section concentrates on improving your balance with standing moves that work your core. After that is the ""Bi's and Booty"" section which targets your biceps and butt. The ""Abs"" section is probably the most intense section with more reps and two types of crunches. You finish with a nice stretch.

Overall, I can not recommend this workout because it is not intense enough for anyone but those who are entirely out of shape, but if you are just starting out it would be good to show you proper form on some basic moves. However, I think you would quickly outgrow it and there are much better workouts out there that demonstrate good form.",1231286400,4,2529,4.844907407407407
8220109,3,B000VUHDB8,"If you want a video that's good for eye candy, then this might be a good one for you.  If you want a serious workout video, then you might find this one to be too fluffy and even downright annoying.  There's two women and one man who are in Baywatch-lifeguard shape doing the exercises.  They do some pretty basic exercises.  They spend a lot of time running in place...if I wanted to do that, I could run outside for free!  Anyhow, the comments that the instructor makes is just annoying.  Like saying over and over ""think of how sexy your booty is going to be..."" and even insulting as she refers to the only male on the video as ""man candy.""  Also, after each section of the video, the instructor then strikes a model pose and looks at the camera in a sultry way.  Maybe if I wanted a swimsuit model video, I'd enjoy that.  I was looking for a good workout, and have over a dozen other videos I'd rather use for a good workout.  But, if you want to watch sexy model Baywatch lifeguard-types bouncing on your TV screen, then go for it!",1219104000,,1037,4.271794871794872
8220110,5,B000VUHDB8,"I love this workout video! Lauren Jones is wonderful. She has a great body which definitely motivates the viewer to reach the ultimate goal for the best looking body possible. I can't wait to see her do more videos, she helps me to stay in shape and I believe she will help you too. Order TODAY and you will not regret it!",1204243200,,322,4.209677419354839
8220111,4,B000VUHDB8,"This is a nice beginner/intermediate work-out...not a lot of cardio but rarely do other fintess videos have instructors who blow kisses during the rountines. Lauren is fun albeit a bit stereotypical of a beach bunny. Great scenery, lots of good weight work and abs.

The only criticism is the routine is divided into three parts and then each part is repeated...this can make it a little slow.",1200355200,,393,4.865671641791045
8220112,5,B000VUHDB8,"I work out a few times a week and do fitness DVDs pretty regularly. This DVD is a great combination of a solid exercise routine and a fun reminder of one of my favorite TV shows.  The set is great - I love looking at the beach while I'm exercising and Lauren Jones is so funny. I love the way she is encouraging and motivating, while not being one of those annoying cheerleader types.  She's got a great body which is very inspiring and will make me do this DVD over and over again until I'm ready to hit the beach myself!",1196726400,,522,4.107843137254902
