5525928,3,B00AXFK96M,"We received this on the day it was released(yesterday), and have watched it a couple times.  My boys like it and got most of the jokes, but I felt that it was not as good, nor as witty, as was the Phantom Menace(the first Lego Star Wars featurette).  This film is 22 minutes long with no extras or special features(unlike the Phantom Menace, which had several); total bummer.  On the plus side, the package comes with a nifty ""celebration"" Darth Vader wearing a medal.

We are glad to have this addition to our Lego Star Wars collection, but I sure do wish the film was better and that there was more 'there' there.",1364342400,,615,4.415929203539823

5525930,5,B00AXFK96M,"We received this today and my 4 year old Star Wars LEGO fan said.  ""Its celebration Vader,""  quickly followed by ""Huh he wasn't at the celebration.""  I had to laugh,  since the minifig included is Vader with his Medal.  I along with my two kids all enjoyed this video more than the Padawan Menace.  I wasn't crazy about the Padawan Menace episode but it was a necessary purchase for to get young Han aka little Han as my son calls him.

As with all LEGO productions it has clean humor for kids and adults.  If you aren't concerned about the minifig then I would say get this over padawan menace.  If you want the minifigs get them both.  As for no blueray, not really concerned its a cartoon.  We have all the clone wars so far on SD also and for a cartoon I don't see the need for blue ray.  Plus you can play these in the car.",1364256000,,828,4.138364779874214
5525931,3,B00AXFK96M,"Arrived early thanks to Amazon pre-order.  Nice show for the kids but note that unlike The Padawan Menace this has no special features so much shorter total runtime that the first disc.  This edition does come with a Lego Darth Vader, which is a nice touch, but I would give up the minifigure for a Blu-ray disc and some extras / special features.",1364169600,30,347,4.492063492063492
5525932,4,B00AXFK96M,"Great compliment to the Padawan Menace and love that they use voices from ""The Clone Wars"" series, but wish they had a Blu-ray version since this is 2013 and they had one for the Padawan Menace.",1361923200,64,194,4.416666666666667

5525990,4,B00AXFK96M,"Goofy, all-ages scrambling of the Star Wars universe, with scatological humor involving characters from the first 6 Star Wars films, in Lego format of course. Silly enough for kids but plenty of gags aimed at the older set (such as references to Han shooting first). Anthony Daniels lending his voice to C3P0 was a nice touch of authenticity as well, but doubt that's enough to qualify this as canon. Just silly fun for the whole family.",1454716800,,437,4.7631578947368425

5526089,4,B00AXFK96M,"Once upon a time, there was HARDWARE WARS; now we have Lego Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Out. Both are very short, jumping from one joke to the next, and aimed at junior viewers. Parents will find humor in it as well. C3PO & Chewbacca coming out of a bathroom with flushing sounds is about as questionable as the humor gets.

The story does a fast-paced mix-and-match of various story elements from various films throughout the SW series, and contains numerous references to both the films & the Lego Star Wars games. Still, the story here is self-contained -- no mean feat really -- and adds a nice touch with the Maul-Vader rivalry.

Pros: Anthony Daniels himself voices C-3PO, and accordingly becomes a more useful character.

Cons: $10 for 22 minutes.",1418860800,,756,4.755725190839694

5526145,4,B00AXFK96M,An animated comedy spoofing the Star Wars series. It's funny and looks impressive. Everything is made of Lego. It's child friendly. There are other parts that you should buy along with you. It is shorter than I expected. I may see the Lego Movie which is currently in cinemas. You might like Robot Chicken dvds.,1394236800,,311,4.672727272727273

5526149,5,B00AXFK96M,"While I am at a loss to explain why this isn't on blu ray, I must still say that it was fun to watch. I have the padawan menace and that one was great as well. The exclusive figures that come with it are also pretty cool. I loved playing lego star wars with my friend's son (I lived with my friends at the time, their daughter is my goddaughter). We both laughed at the slapstick/humor. It was rather clever and appealed to both the younger generation and the generation that grew up with the original star wars. Sometimes the jokes are a bit campy but in a good way. A lot of inside jokes for those of us who have seen everything star wars related. Some of the more adult jokes would go over the heads of the younger viewers. Either way you'll all be laughing by the end. The humor of the games translates well into an animated format, even though they talk now (instead of just slapstick and sounds) the jokes are spot-on. Great idea to use some of the voices from the animated Clone Wars series.",1392940800,,998,4.257894736842105
5526150,5,B00AXFK96M,My daughter loved it.  Typical Lego but the Darth vader character is hard to find as a stand alone product.,1392336000,,107,4.35

5526153,5,B00AXFK96M,Typical Lego comedy. Its really entertaining. I had to add this to my movie collection. A really good animated movie.,1391385600,,117,4.9
5526154,5,B00AXFK96M,"This was a Christmas gift for my two kids. They were very excited. Their favorite toy is Legos' so that was a win, and then their favorite movie is Star Wars! Win win! I would highly recommend for any Lego fan or any Star Wars fan. Very entertaining for the while family.",1390780800,,271,4.230769230769231
5526155,5,B00AXFK96M,"The jokes are cheesy, but not horrible. There are a lot of inside jokes for fans of the series. My kiddos are too young to see Star Wars (live-action or Clone Wars), so this was a perfect fit for them. Looking forward to more from the lego team. The included Darth Vader mini fig is a nice addition to the collection as well, since we did not have one of him.",1390348800,,359,4.070422535211268

5526158,5,B00AXFK96M,"First, in the world of Lego, a Darth Vader Minifig by himself is like ten bucks. So consider that in the price you pay. The Half Hour Cartoon, which is actually quite entertaining, is more of a bonus. Do not expect it to respect Star Wars continuity, it's just some silliness for the kids. And it succeeds in that wonderfully.",1389139200,,326,4.45
5526159,4,B00AXFK96M,This was a gift for my grandson who is six. He likes the mini figures and seemed happy when he received it. When the item arrived i looked at it and for the money paid it seemed to be made ok i would not recommend for a younger child as the figure was tiny,1389052800,,256,3.759259259259259
5526160,5,B00AXFK96M,My son loved this movie and it made it even more awesome that he got a darth vadar figure. I think the movie is humorous even for adults who like star wars.,1388707200,,156,3.90625
5526161,5,B00AXFK96M,A fun movie for the whole family. The exclusive Darth Vader mini-figure is a bonus and will be an added item to my son's mini-figures collection. Great buy.,1388534400,,156,4.607142857142857
5526162,5,B00AXFK96M,"This one builds on the Padawan Menace with more jokes and jabs at the live-action movies. My son loves both LEGO Star Wars movies and this one is a must for any Star Wars fan,",1388448000,,175,4.0285714285714285
5526163,5,B00AXFK96M,I enjoyed watching this and laughing at the inside jokes that are peppered through this good natured video. My son laughed a lot and it really was nicely done. The darth vader minigured is a treat. Well worth watching multiple times.,1388448000,,233,4.7073170731707314
5526164,5,B00AXFK96M,The humor works on different levels to keep both age groups entertained.  Highly recommend if you have a little Lego lover in the house!,1388448000,2,136,4.666666666666667
5526165,5,B00AXFK96M,"If you want to find a darth vader mini fig, it is not easy. He comes in the bigger sets. I felt lucky to find this reasonably priced DVD and mini figure. My son was super excited",1388188800,,178,3.8378378378378377
5526166,5,B00AXFK96M,"This movie is a hit for both the target audience, as well as the adults in the house.  There are insider movie-related jokes which the grownups will get, and my son loved this movie from the first viewing.  A little bit of a letdown that there is not a digital version, though.  Lego should do better at that.",1388188800,,309,4.293103448275862

5526169,5,B00AXFK96M,"My 5, 9, and 11 yr old all loved this little movie (it is short) and I did as well. We watched a library copy so I'm basing our opinion of the movie on the movie not the price. They laughed loud and long at much of the dialog and antics that poke fun at the actual Star Wars story. The immature approval seeking of Darth Maul and Vader is utterly hilarious for adults watching but the kids ""got it"" too. Mixing up Lego humor (i.e. pieces coming apart and characters needing to put parts back together) plus a great well-known story is Lego entertainment's forte. My kids watched it numerous times and ""rewound"" certain scenes repeatedly because they found them so funny. This Lego movie is as wonderful as all the other Lego shows and movies. Nothing to fear here, it's just a clever witty show.",1387670400,,795,4.414965986394558

5526187,5,B00AXFK96M,"Maybe it was because I wasn't expecting much from a ""kids"" product, but this is a clever and wonderfully written companion piece for anyone who's a fan of Star Wars. There are even humourous nods to the ""Han shot first"" controversy and Darth Vader's infamous ""Noooooooooooooooooooooooo"" from Episode III. The clever details and inside jokes hidden in the background signage are also a bonus for obsessive fans. If you're a Star Wars fan, especially if you have kids, this short movie is a must watch.",1382572800,,500,4.894117647058824

5526191,5,B00AXFK96M,This was really funny and all of my kids love it! You can't beat the price either! The cost of the Darth Vader mini figure alone is higher than this DVD/mini figure set. You can't beat that!,1381276800,,190,4.162162162162162

My son will laugh out loud at some of the jokes...its really cute. I would say kids younger than 5 could watch this, its not violent. And definitely the older kids will find it entertaining as well. The only bummer is that this DVD has a run time of 22min! Crazy! I wish they could have made it longer.

5526196,5,B00AXFK96M,I love the spin that Lego puts on the Star Wars universe. I'm a S.W. nerd; it's great that they put little one liners and tidbits in to entertain adults and not just children.,1379116800,,175,4.176470588235294

5526198,5,B00AXFK96M,"Synopsis:  The Rebels have blown up the Death Star... but it's not over yet, as Luke Skywalker needs to find the hidden Imperial bunker while Han Solo and Princess Leia go to Naboo for reinforcements (they're the lucky ones though, because the rest of the Rebels have to go to that overfrozen Wampa toilet known as Hoth!)  Darth Vader figures he's going to be spending some quality time with the Emperor, but ends up going to find Luke because The Emperor wants that jerk Darth Maul to help them construct the new Death Star.  Will the Rebels succeed in defeating the Empire again, or will the Empire crush the Rebellion once and for all?  Anthony Daniels reprises his role from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Original-Star-Wars-Trilogy/dp/B000PMLFRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Original Star Wars Trilogy</a>&nbsp;as the voice of C-3PO.

To all the parents wondering if this is age appropriate for their kids, there's a few instances of crude humor (C-3PO tells Chewbacca to ""watch his paw"" when they land on top of each other during a space battle, the Emperor calls Darth Maul a Sith head because of his insolence) but nothing wholly objectionable for ages 6 and up.  To put it in perspective, I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spaceballs/dp/B003UAMWWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spaceballs</a>&nbsp;when I was a six year old and that was way, way, way more offensive than this.

The humor is definitely geared towards kids in the slapstick variety that likes to reference running gags.  However, adults will likely giggle or laugh out loud at the silly humor as well; so it's not like a kid's film that feels like it goes on forever.  Star Wars fans will enjoy this, as the cartoon parodies both Star Wars and the Family Guy parody of Star Wars while maintaining running gags for fans of all the movies.  Best part in my opinion?

(Solo shoots a Stormtrooper)
C-3PO:  Han shot first!
Solo:  Of course I did, why wouldn't I?  It was either him or me!
C-3PO:  That is the subject of much debate!

Kids will enjoy it, adults will gladly sit through it, and Star Wars fans will giggle like kids.  The makers of this short movie wanted to make an entertaining cartoon and as far as I'm concerned, they knocked it out of the park.  So if you've ever wanted to see Luke Skywalker in a situation where a gaggle of teenage girls would be more dangerous to his well-being than the entire Empire could ever be, then this is certainly the film for you.  Well done!",1377302400,,2554,5.125603864734299

5526219,5,B00AXFK96M,"From the very beginning of this Lego film, the humor explodes. The story features the battle between Darth Vader and Darth Maul as well as a Rebel mission to keep the Empire from hurting the Rebels on their new base. The short movie takes place between episodes IV and V but, the humor is drawn from parodies and puns from all of the Star Wars films. From start to finish the action is humorous, the jokes are great, especially if you are fairly familiar with the Star Wars films. The action is fast paced and the jokes never stop. While not a deep or brilliant film, there is an elegance to the simplicity that makes the film worth watching over and over. I highly recommend this film for children and adults who love Legos or Star Wars.

Also, the Darth Vader minifigure is quite nice. It is the same high quality figures that Lego makes with an exclusive printed medal. Though, there is no lightsaber, the figure is still worth the price of the movie on its own.

It features several voice talents from the Star Wars saga, as well as the animated Clone Wars series. The humor is quirky, family friendly, and consistent with the last title; in terms of parodying the Star Wars saga, especially that of the mired prequel trilogy. That being said, I believe this series would still fit in well with the more mature Family Guy, and Robot Chicken Star Wars parody sets.
As is mentioned with some of the other reviews, there is no Blu-ray disc included. I didn't think it was really necessary for The Padawan Menace, and so for me, it wasn't really missed this time around. Despite this fact, I would not view it as a point of contention for purchasing, unless you are an A/V purist, or only sought out DVD/Blu-ray sets. My only real critique, like that of it's predecessor, is that at only 22 minutes long, it felt a bit short. There was also no specials, nor any extra material for this release. However, for something under the $10 price range, I don't think I can complain too much.

Taking place shortly after the first Death Star is destroyed, Luke goes on a mission to find he's hindered by the mob of girls who have latched onto his new celebrity.  Meanwhile Vader and Darth Maul duke it out to be the Emperor's favorite.  It's a cute and often silly story featuring great animation and voice work.  On top of that at only 22 minutes it doesn't grow tiresome. For that alone it's worth picking it up and enjoying.

Unfortunately the disc release is very much lacking.  While the pack-in of a special Darth Vader Lego Mini-figure is a nice touch, especially for folks that picked up the previous release and it's pack-in, the DVD is bare bones.  There is some basic navigation and that's it.  No bonuses or special features to speak of.  Also, unlike Padawan Menace there's no blu ray, just the DVD release.

My kids really liked it, and I laughed quite a bit myself.  What's really neat is the inclusion of the actual sound effects from the SW films that devoted fans instantly recognize.  Plus, Anthony Daniels is on hand to lend his voice to C3PO once again.  The voice of Darth Vader isn't James Earl Jones, but it wasn't until the end credits that I knew for sure, the imitation is so good.
