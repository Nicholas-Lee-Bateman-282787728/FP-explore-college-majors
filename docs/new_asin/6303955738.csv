7856924,4,6303955738,"In this video, Gould plays Bagatelle Opus 26, No. 3, the F major Variations, Opus 34 and Piano Concerto No. 5, Emperor with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra conducted by Karel Ancerl. This video includes straight  music only and no Gouldfs talk. You may feel a slight eccentric accent in  the very first cadenza. Other than this, performance is punchy and sharp.  However, I am not sure that this Emperor, such a competitive piano  concerto, is the best amongst numerous recordings. On the other hand, I  have not seen his concerto performance other than one in this video. This  is a definitely valuable film, if you are a Gould fan. Sound is mono, but  good. Quality of picture is also good. The performance seems to have been  filmed in the TV studio. I wish that this performance had been in the  concert hall live. I think all works in this video are available on CDs,  too.",961891200,19,877,4.6
