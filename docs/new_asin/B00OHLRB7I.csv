6751361,2,B00OHLRB7I,"For a Not Rated film of this variety, I expected family humor for young teens.  The movie opens and within minutes one couple is going at it in a bathroom stall : ( .  NOT what I expected.  Luckily, I was previewing this and did not start out watching it with my young teen, as this is not a family friendly ""Not Rated"" film at all.  It's also kind of cheesy and the acting is mediocre at best.  They skipped the subtitles as well and it can be hard to catch all of the dialogue without them.",1422144000,,492,4.030927835051546
6751362,3,B00OHLRB7I,"LOTS OF RECOGNIZABLE STARS AND A FEW LAUGHS HERE AND THERE, A BIT ON THE RAUNCHY SIDE

INTRO: I state raunchy not as a judgment, but simply so people know up front and can decide for themselves.  I have certainly seen pithier movies, but for those not interested in that sort of thing, you might want to skip this one.  If you are ok with a little off color humor, this has it all the way through the film.  I would not call the romance sweet, though it had a few sweet moments.  I found myself often thinking ""that was a clever exchange"" or ""oh, that was a nice comeback"", yet I didn't really laugh out loud that often (I chuckled inside more).  There are lots of supporting characters that are pretty interesting or humorous and the lead couple are strong enough to bring it home if the movie suites your tastes.  I would also say the movie starts a little rough and gains some traction over time. Again, if it suites your tastes to begin with.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Vincent (Geoff Stults)  is a high powered divorce lawyer that never loses.  Furthermore, his clients walk away with outrageous settlements.  He is the prototypical playboy who is afraid of commitment.  One of his best buddies is Kenny (Josh Hopkins)  the marriage counselor, his opposite in many ways.  One evening while at a club with the whole gang, including Kenny's serious girlfriend Stephanie (Jennifer Finnigan), they encounter a gorgeous ""man-eater"" Jane (Mina Suvari) making mincemeat of would-be approachers.  As Jane toys with other men in the club, Vincent the lawyer becomes interested and makes his play which involves a little bet.  He fails.  As fate would have it, Jane is Stephanie's best friend who Vincent has never met, mainly because Stephanie had no intention of letting that ever happen.  You see, the reason Jane is such a man eater is because she went through an awful divorce where her husband got everything.  Now she lives a life of free sex, or revenge sex, and no commitment.  Of course everyone starts spending more time together and lots of little bets ensue (and a few big ones).  It's the whole premise as you might have guessed.  In any case, Jane is good at absolutely everything and suddenly the man who never looses is never winning.  The punishments that come with each lost bet are clever and sometimes even hilarious.  You can guess what's happening as time goes on, but I won't give away how it resolves itself.

OTHER THOUGHTS: The beginning of the movie didn't pick up that quickly.  Once they get into the actual relationship and challenges are made, it worked just enough to keep me interested.  Mena Suvari was also a key for me as she was terrific at being both a Man-Eater, and a complete sweetheart at times.  Making the guys dance at a gay bar after a lost bet wasn't original, but still genius!  Unfortunately they only mildly capitalizes on the moment as their dance was funny, but didn't really bust me out laughing the way it should have.  I know there are going to be a lot of people who won't find this movie funny and I definitely think that's valid.  I myself thought it was more clever in their retorts and banter, more than I thought it was knee slapping funny.  Hopefully I have described enough for each person to make their own choice whether to skip it or not.  If you are still interested, I suggest a rental first.  For those interested, Kristin Chenoweth features prominently on the DVD cover, but has only a small cameo at the beginning of the movie.

RATING AND CONTENT:  This DVD lists no rating.  However, there is enough language and one flash of breasts that an R rating would likely have been applied.  The movie avoids plenty of opportunity for nudity all the way through, so the one brief scene of nudity was a little odd, though meant to illustrate a point.",1421712000,9,3809,4.603268945022288

8683654,2,B00OHLRB7I,"Very hard to follow, alot of scenes don't seem to have a reason for being in it. I didn't find it funny . Definately geared towards a lounge llizard mentality, male audience. There was hardly any storyline and the scenes were just one disjointed scene after another with gratuitous sex thrown in. The mascot of the film is a penis statue which they either explained so quickly I missed it or maybe it's just something we are supposed to ""get"" as in understand. All I got from this is hoping that guys aren't REALLY like how they're represented to be in this film. In one pivital scene the lead is in a car with a one night stand he'd picked up the night before, he decides to be a ""nice guy"" and drive this one home,  BUT first he stops at Mena Suvaris place to prove to her he's ""changed"" because he didn't sleep with the girl! IMO if he had changed he wouldn't of picked up the one night stand in the FIRST place! duh",1436745600,,919,4.221590909090909
