8208475,4,B000TAZJPW,This vocational film contains some nice World War II vintage footage of a pharmacist at work.  It is not very long but the content is factual and describes the pharmaceutical scene of the times.,1357084800,,194,4.705882352941177
8208476,5,B000TAZJPW,"I remember seeing similar films, shown by coach when it was raining and there was nothing else to do in gym class.  Now I'm teaching a History of Pharmacy class at a local university and find this film valuable.  First, as an honest (if somewhat campy by 21st century standards) look at the profession at that point in time.  Second, for the unintended humor contained in the film, especially with respect to the roles of women in the profession.  Overall, it's very good for this use.  Quality and audio are as good as could be expected, better than the old projector coach used in the gym.",1245888000,,591,4.537735849056604
