2568093,4,B000FILVFA,"Not just soft. It's flaccid, floppy, and limp. It's silly, fun, and adventurous, but it's still pretty limp.

What's to like? A lot, really. This comes down to us from a time when a B-cup was a god-given gift of beauty and a joy to behold, rather than an unhappy accident to be repaired with implants. It's filled with silliness. ""We need water - quick, take your shirt off!"" And best, the silliness just gets better as it goes along. Watch the costumes on The Grand Dames of Whatever - the colors get brighter, the poufs get poufier, and the haircuts get closer to one of the worse ""Dune"" movies.

Babes, bods, bouncing boobies, and bravado. There's a lot to like. Nothing that matters, but a lot anyway.

There's lots of nudity with a spattering of sexual scenes. Her friend, Zadou, has a nice, but plain face, but a great body.

The DVD is presented in a plain package; a picture of Tawny on front with the title, Gwendoline, and a picture of her on the back in one of the uniforms from the movie. This looks to be the French version dubbed in English except for the English characters, but I could be wrong. The titles are in French.

It's been a while since I've seen the movie on cable, so I don't know what makes this ""Unrated director's cut"" special.

If you're interested in Tawny's acting, get Witchboard or Bachelor Party. If you want to see one of the sexiest woman running around naked and pretending to have sex, buy this DVD!",1170028800,5,901,4.383233532934132

2568098,5,B000FILVFA,"I have been wanting to pick up this obscure movie for years, ever since I first watched it some 12 years ago.  Unfortunately, up until now it has been out of print - even on VHS.  I was un-willing to pay an obnoxious price for a used version on Video tape.  Now there is no reason to fret any more:  Gwendoline is here & she's on DVD!!!

The original title of the film was The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak.  It is basically a low-budget INDIANA JONES type of adventure movie, only with a whole lot more erotica mixed in. One could say there are elements of Monty Python as well. Brent Huff plays a Harrison Ford wannabe.  He has a great physique for an adventure movie, but he's not a particularly good actor.  The third major character is Gwendoline's sidekick / friend, Beth (played by French actress Zabou).

The overwhelming reason to buy this DVD may be summed up in 3 words: Tawny Kitaen topless!  While she has stripped down in a few other movies (such as WITCHBOARD), one needs to have the pause button on the DVD remote handy to get a good look.  Not so with this film.  She is topless throughout most of the 2nd half of the film - and that's a very good thing!!!

I can't for the life of me understand why Tawny has not had a more robust acting career or why she didn't make many more movies.  For one thing, there have not been too many female redhead movie stars.  Tawny is gorgeous and there are a few scenes in this film where she is absolutely ravishing - to the extent that she took my breath away.  She is also a better actress than a great many women in Hollywood.

To be sure, this is a very corny movie.  Tawny and Zabou are good actors;  the rest of the cast are all a bit stilted.  I believe it was originally in French as the people all suffer from dubbing-man's disease.  However, it is also a very fun movie, and I had forgotten just how cute Zabou is.

So, if you are even a remote fan of Tawny Kitaen you need to JUMP at the opportunity to buy this one.  It's a feel good movie and Tawny is the one who will making you feel good!",1162252800,102,2075,4.145363408521304
2568099,1,B000FILVFA,"I generally like some of these French-comic-books-turned-into-movies because they're usually pretty erotic.  Jane Fonda's role in Barbarella comes to mind.  This Gwendoline series definitely had the POTENTIAL what with the scantily-clad women-in-bondage theme and the scenes involving Gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend.

But the very beautiful Tawney Kitaen (cast as Gwendoline) apparently balked at doing girl/girl scenes (this was 1984, after all), and so the producers obligingly didn't force her to do any, and as a result this one turned into a very bland, weak, and diluted version of Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It's not a good adventure film, and it's certainly not erotic.

There's a little nudity, and some ridiculous moments that are supposed to capture the kinkiness of the French comics, but overall this one was a disappointing bust.",1158105600,12,851,5.416666666666667

2568117,3,B000FILVFA,"What a daft movie.

A comedy skin flick of sorts, or it would be if Tawny Kitaen would just lower her bloody hands. And her elbows. We get a couple of short flashes of the forbidden fruit but then she covers up again. Why is a mystery, since she must have known she wasn't hired for her acting skills (which can be seen in all their glory in 'Bachelor Party' and it doesn't get any better than that here). What little plot there is is Barbarella-esque, but the payoff isn't there because 80s Kitaen seems nowhere near as at-ease sans clothing in front of the camera as 60s Fonda was. Shame, because she had a nice bod in those days. I guess she figured she was no Fonda, able to build a sleazey T&A movie into a career in the mainstream.

I'll pull a star for her behavior and another for general lack of oomf. This sort of movie should stack up against Barbarella and Emmanuelle and it lacks the humor of the former, the lush production of the latter and the plot and eye-candy of either, at least until the last 20 minutes. Some of the stuff in the ""torture chamber"" is rather cleverly done but then the spikes all turn out to be rubber. We can tell because the ""actors"" forget to not lean on them every so often.

There's a Ben Hur-esque chase involving chariots drawn by teams of bare-breasted girls but for pony girls there's precious little  of the equestrian about their costuming. Also, if you want to wave a whip around while the sound FX cracks but you *don't* want to hit anyone, use long-handled buggy whips rather than having the wielders wave coiled bullwhips around in the air. Important fetish trotting tip there, sadly one which the director was not privy to.

How Just Jaeckin was involved with this I'll never know. It completely misses all the targets he hit so well in his other movies.

2568141,2,B000FILVFA,"I bought this movie because I thought Justin Jaeckin's movie version of ""The Story of O"" was ""pretty good"" (about a B- overall), and because the many still photos from this movie (available on the web, through an easy Google search) looked interesting.  I'd hoped for a ""Indiana Jones meets Story of O"" theme, and the movie makes an attempt to deliver, with an unexpected dose of comedy.  Unfortunately, unlike ""O"" (and ""Indiana Jones""), the acting in this movie was unbelievably awful, and was in fact rather silly in some cases, as was the writing.  The ""visuals"" were pretty good, that is, there were plenty of pretty women wearing very limited clothing, put into some intriguing situations, and well photographed as they sorted it out.  The movie may bear a second viewing, although that seems doubtful, at least in the near future.  I think the best thing I can say about ""Gwendoline"" is that I've seen worse.  If one star is the lowest possible score, and five is the highest, then I'd have to give ""Gwendoline"" about two stars, with the best part of that score going to the photography and the somewhat successful attempts to be funny.",1378512000,,1142,4.742424242424242

I love skin, & I love camp, & I can sit through an awful lot of bad movie to finish a story [a little bit OCD, anyone? ;) ] but this movie doesn't rate 3 stars on its best day!
This is one of only a few movies I've ever walked out on in a theatre [admittedly, it was with my gf of the time dragging me out on this one, but I didn't put up much of a fight.] Finally finished it off years later via rental, and was sad that I'd had to waste money on a rental just so I could scratch that unfinished story itch; it is truly bad. After the one scene in the jungle where Tawny K. gets topless for a shower, it's pretty much all downhill. It's one of those movies where you keep waiting for it to get better: there will be a little scene that offers you some hope that it's about to turn the corner, then another 5 minutes of boringly bad acting & plot... well, it's not development... sideways movement?

Ultimately, there's insufficient nudity to support a movie filled with incredibly poor acting, plot & direction. Excellent cinematography can only do so much!

The only way to give this a higher rating would be to insert porn elements that to my understanding were just never shot to be available for inserting into a ""director's cut."" Seriously, I've seen low-budget porn that except for their shot-on-video camera work were easily superior to this movie both on storyline & acting.

Bad, bad, bad. Not so bad it's funny, just so bad it's seriously awful! The only reason it gets 2 stars out of me is because 1: it's dvd instead of vhs [talk about compounding the awfulness w/ a cr@p picture!] & 2: what nudity there is has some truly lovely girls in the cast. If Tawny had stripped off more & really gotten into this, she could have saved the movie. C'est la vie!",1310515200,2,1835,4.3130434782608695

One thing that will appeal to some males watching it, is Julie ""Tawny"" Kitaen's lead role in it. Tawny was in Bachelor Party, and some Whitesnake videos when she was with David Coverdale.

Most guys who came of age in the 80's would likely know the film because there's a TON of topless nudity in the second half of it - it's akin to a film like ""Barbarella"" in that it's derived from a French comic and there's a highly sexual element to it, but to tell the truth, the film/story (about a young woman who is searching for her father & a rare butterfly, and discovers a society of warrior-like women) is really not that good and the acting is pretty uniformly subpar.  I'd be curious what was cut from this, that created the edited version, because there's not a whole lot of plot to begin with?  I WILL say, however, that this uncut director's cut has a REALLY good transfer (in 2:35:1 widescreen) and the image is very sharp, and this wasn't even a blu-ray.  Extras are ok - trailers, commentary, some other ancillary interview footage.  I can't imagine anyone would want to watch this more than once, unless you're a devout Tawny fan, but to each his own.

In the Soviet Russia in the 80s, when I was in the university, the only source of information about Western (made in West, not just the cowboy stuff) movies - besides the officially approved and thus empty editions - was a couple of obscure and very cheezy Polish magazines, printed on bad paper with smudged photos and unreadable texts. ""Gwendoline"" was a sensation with them and they dedicated article after article to the movie (they did the same with Emmanuelle and other softcore masterpieces).
So I finally decided to find out what was all the frenzy about.

Well , the 70s and 80s are over (thanks for small mercies) and the movie proved to be so bad, that it is not even good. You know, how we often say - oh, it is so bad it is delicious. This is not the case. This one clearly transcends the stage ""so bad, it is actully good"" and goes into ""oh boy, bad is not the word"".

Even softcore adventures should have at least one good idea, one good laugh and one good line per movie. This one does not. Girls look good (nobody argues) , the boy looks great (very neat six-pack) , costumes (if you can call them that) are rather abbreviated.

Usually when I do not like a movie and do not intend to keep it, I give it away. In this  case I dropped it into trash as I would have been too ashamed to give it to anybody - not because of the naked bodies, but due to sheer stupidy of the film.",1183420800,11,1491,4.2140350877192985
2568185,2,B000FILVFA,"I remembered this movie from high school as a mildly amusing adventure story with some pretty girls showing some of their charms. I had a faulty memory.

The pretty girls are there. Tawny Kitaen and Zabou and definitely easy on the eyes and they show themselves off quite a bit. So do a lot of other girls but those are nothing to stick in the memory. The problem though is with the story.

It is a silly adventure story but it is much worse than I remembered. A girl devotes herself to finding the butterfly her scientist father died trying to find. She is aided by her girl sidekick and by a mercenary guide. They find the butterfly and a lost civilization of Amazons with nefarious plans. Silly but the background is worse.

What I did not remember or realize from all those years ago is that this is some sort of fetish film intended to excite those who like seeing women wear leather and be led around on leashes. Blah!

It was watchable but not very good.",1181606400,6,961,4.382022471910112
2568186,3,B000FILVFA,"This movie is a typical sexy B-movie, but it has enough scenery to keep your attention while trying to find the plot.  We watched this twice through, and each time was about the same.  Funny, sexy, but kinda cheap and amateurish, like most B-movies can tend to be.  Knowing that you are not getting this movie for the plot or action scenes, but for the scenery and Tawny, you can settle in and enjoy this movie.  There are a couple of scenes that are a bit gross, but overall it isn't as bad of a movie as I had expected.  And yes, Tawny does look good in it.  :)",1180483200,3,563,4.1192660550458715

8123260,3,B000FILVFA,"I hadn't seen Tawny Kitaen in years, and did not read the reviews; The cover looks neat(unrated director's cut), doesn't it? So here is a good review of this movie: I liked the 3 actors, and the best scene is at 50min mark, where the male is using a straw. The movie is silly but fun--It is well-done, but I do NOT like fetish or any bondage. So I ff it til the end, just to see how it ended. If they had not had ANY bondage it would have been an ok movie....Also I like to see what the writing is about, and I never could get ""cc"" for hearing impaired feature. Also the ""extras"" are a joke. So I rate it fair, because the 3 actors are good, but the movie is too long, due to the fetish garbage, etc.",1493596800,,700,3.936619718309859
