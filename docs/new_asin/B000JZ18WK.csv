8153574,5,B000JZ18WK,"This is a nice restorative yoga DVD that lasts just 30 minutes, which is probably a good thing if you're short on time.  More and more I've been doing 30-minute workouts because of life's demands.  A 30-minute ""yoga nightcap"" is doable, whereas a 60-minute one isn't. You could always extend savasana if you wanted more than 30 minutes.

This was my first restorative yoga DVD, but I've taken restorative yoga classes before. That said, this is a really nice restorative yoga practice.

I've been collecting all the YBB DVDs, and I'm impressed with each one.  They are all fun and different, and definitely different from any other DVD I've tried, and I've tried a lot.

This is a great DVD to use right before bed.  I would suggest brushing your teeth and slipping into your PJs before doing this DVD. That way, you can roll into bed and fall into a deep, relaxed sleep.

If you're new to Teigh and Gillian, the YBB instructors, they are positive and pleasant.  Their good energy comes through in the DVD.

As in their other YBB DVDs, they start out in ""easy sitting pose,"" and do a few minutes of kundalini inspired yoga, including a mudra and setting an intention.

They use two blankets, a bolster, a strap and two foam blocks, but you can substitute, towels, pillows, a robe sash or a tie, and small pillows for the items used.

Although this DVD isn't a workout, it's a nice add-on to anyone doing the YBB DVDs or someone just seeking a ""yoga nightcap.""  It could also be used in place of a nap or for a deep relaxation session.  At just 30 minutes, it's easy to fit it in to a busy day.  In fact, that's when it's probably the most useful.",1390003200,,1646,4.45819397993311
8153575,5,B000JZ18WK,"This is a really great before bed workout. It really helps you relax. You do need a few items(eye pillow, yoga strap, yoga blocks and yoga bolsters). I highly recommend this DVD.",1304380800,,178,4.59375
8153576,5,B000JZ18WK,"Teigh and Gillian created a wonderful pajima time workout that really relaxs your body and mind. If you had a long day at work this is the best way to unwind and forget all your worries. Now understand that this video is not ment to be a workout where you burn alot of calories, it's more to just restore your self ...

you start off with some gental swaying movements and breathing techniques. Then you do a sholder excercise, frog exercercise, then some leg streches,upside down child pose, sholder stand and another breathing technique. Finally you one last relaxing pose that will make you fall alseep (or almost). You will need a couple of firm pillows,a yoga band(you can subsitue with resistant band), eye pillow(you really don't need it that badly) and a couple of blankets ( any will do)and yoga blocks which if you a couple of firm pillows or one big pillow you will be fine. This dvd lasts for about 30 minutes. I would recommend buying this dvd if you can it really does work , and help you get a restful night of sleep!",1246492800,4,1032,4.48936170212766
