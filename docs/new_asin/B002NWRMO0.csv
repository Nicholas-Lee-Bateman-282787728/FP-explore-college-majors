3960260,5,B002NWRMO0,"I thought this film might teach me a few origami patterns.  Instead, it opened-up to me a world that I didn't know even existed.  It's still hard for me to realize that each piece of art shown in the film was created by the folding of a single sheet of paper!  It just doesn't seem possible!

The artists featured were quite articulate and expressed themselves very clearly.  In the background there was a  subtle, supportive musical score that created an awe and unity to the presentation.  I feel so grateful that I had the chance to see this film.",1271289600,3,550,4.494949494949495

3960262,5,B002NWRMO0,"I heard about this film and ordered a copy. I have watched it a couple of times and will watch it again this weekend. It is absolutely remarkable what can be created from a single flat piece of paper.  It is scheduled to run again on lots of PBS stations so you might want to see it there, then buy a copy.  The artwork and mathematical models need to be seen to truly appreciate them, words are not adequate. The film has the added benefit of presenting the creators perspectives.  These innovators are varied in perspective but all interesting.

I teach a couple of graduate level courses on origami as a tool for engaging K-12 students in learning, especially in, but not limited to, the math area.  I was happy to see this film with many of the individuals whose work I reference in my classes.",1268784000,,798,4.438356164383562

Ah, but it's nice to see my tax dollars doing something useful for a change.

Gorgeous doc by Vanessa Gould that explores and celebrates Origami and its increasingly real-world applications. Non-stop beauty as the folders fold and discuss their motives and joys while so doing. Some astoundingly lovely works of art emerge; my favorite folks were the Eric/ks: Eric Demaine and Eric Joisel, one a prof at M.I.T. by age 20, the other a true sculpting genius, both united by their love of the origamic discipline and its seemingly endless inherent delights. But everyone on display here is in one way or another a treat to watch and consider. Origami obviously attracts some very bright minds, minds not afraid to fold in on themselves intensely and with much happiness.

I played some with this art form as a kid, but these guys take it to a whole 'nother plane. And planes. And zones. There's a lot to ponder for the math geek in all of us here, and even more for the lover of epiphanic symmetries and tesselations. Gould does a fine job of quickly peering into the minds of about a dozen truly gifted pairs of hands/cortices, and the viewer leaves feeling refreshed and inspired in many ways, and astounded by the level of artistry and genius revealed by some of these folks. At least, I did.

I wish everything on tv were half as entertaining and enlightening as this wonderful little film. Or even 1/16th.

Highly recommended.",1268265600,5,1439,4.717131474103586
3960264,5,B002NWRMO0,"A wonderful way to view the art and science of origami. To watch and listen to both the creative and scientific discussions around the idea of a ""fold"" was delightful.

3960265,5,B002NWRMO0,"When this 55-minute documentary - which played on PBS - begins you are amazed at how intricate practitioners of Origami (Japanese art of paper folding) are. You see one single piece of paper (though it could be five feet in length) become a lizard or a violist or a beautiful multi-colored abstract sculpture. (They use special colored paper to create the latter). Origami requires that the artist use a single sheet, no cutting and no pasting. )> The word ""Amazing"" pops into your head. How o they do this? (Answer: hours and hors of folding and a mind that sees the result long before they start.) The high-definition quality of the original film and its DVD transfer will bring out these astoundingly beautiful images on practically any TV set.

But about half way through the film - when writer, producer and director Vanessa Gould has you mesmerized - we move from the artists to the ""mathematicians"" who use the paper folding to solve long time mathematical questions and teach students in elementary schools about math through origami. You'll meet the father and son geniuses (the younger becoming a professor at MIT at age 20!) that are using it to help scientists examinethe forms of human body cells and DNA. As the son says, ""we may even, someday, find a cure for AIDS"". Then there is the teacher who has integrated origami into the math curriculum in all the elementary schools in Israel and the results of test show that it improves the students' scores.

This film won many festival awards and deservedly so.

The DVD includes a collection of ""deleted scenes"" (my favorite is the genius son who says he does this only because it has to be fun) as well as a six-minute short film (also by Gould) about the Israeli school program.

Whether you appreciate art or science or just want to be fascinated for an hour, this is film that I can highly recommend!

3960266,5,B002NWRMO0,"This film brilliantly illustrates one of those instances when play intersects beauty and utility.  This can be done by eluding formalism (ranging from topology to origami), or not.  In the former case, one ought to follow inspirational heuristics.  It's a showcase for the 'no-limits' nature of human mind and creativity.

The takeaway?  Outside the obvious surface folding domains/applications, this film ought to stimulate our quest for improvement in a lot of other directions.  As well, the human being is so much better at getting from A to B in so many ways rather than explaining the process.  It's a plea for learning by doing and doing while learning;  very inspirational indeed!

___________

As a footnote, I would play this film in many a board room/academic environment where knowledge comes scripted at best. At least, the folks in the latter setting have also Paul Feyerabend.",1261353600,3,891,5.125
3960267,5,B002NWRMO0,"This documentary stays focused on origami however, it is much more a documentary on interdisciplinary art. What is more interesting is that what make origami art can be applied to just about any art or discipline.

The one big plus about this documentary is that it is not a collage of meaningless soundbites. We can almost use this as a training film or at least a professional class.

We start out with the kitsch factor of origami then go through the different forms of origami. Then we get to meet the man that really changed the concept of origami Akira Yoshizawa. From there we learn that there can be more than meets the eye with the mathematical application of origami and the origami application on geometry. We apply origami to potentially all forms of science. Then we even apply it to practical applications as folding of air bags for automobiles.

Now let us slow down and see that the individual artists and engineers presenting this program also are presenting the evolution of how people become experts in their field.  We see that everything starts out (concise or otherwise) as a series of simple skills and progress into complexity. We try to imitate reality. Later we realize that am imitation is just that and drop the effort to imitate in place of capturing its essence. You see this in artists and writers that appear to have gone off the deep end. It also applies to practicality when we stop making robots to look like people and instead capture the functions needed.

If we do not take the time to contemplate the impact of origami on the world, the documentary is just fun to see what you can make or maybe purchase in the world.

I would really have liked to see an expanded documentary on papermaking.

Models of discovery originating with origami have been used in space, in automobile airbags and beyond. Since proteins fold causing diseases like Alzheimer's can medicine cause the proteins to unfold and so cure the disease? The film maker showed the history of origami from an early Japanese practitioner who was the first to use wet folding. His figures look like they are about to breathe they seem so alive. She shows a convention of young people from around the world who are competing with one example of a dragon folded from one sheet of paper with complicated scales. Imagine all the bugs in the universe folded magically before you with all the right number of legs to be anatomically correct...every year the invention with origami gets more complex and more amazing. In the 70's maybe 60 to 80 folds would complete one form. Now maybe 120 to 150 steps are required. And in the future? Over a thousand. She showed the most intricate realistic shapes and then abstract origami. Wow! And its all over the world. She found practitioners in France and Israel all working in very different ways.

3960287,5,B002NWRMO0,"Did you know that children can learn math by folding paper?  BETWEEN THE FOLDS is a documentary of the marriage between paper, art, science and math. Experience shows that when children are given creative ways to fold paper using origami they began to tap into the essence of math.  What is origami?  It is a Japanese art of folding paper into beautiful sculptures and designs.  With one piece of paper one can stimulate, shape and manipulate the paper to anything all without using staples, paper clip, tape or glue to create the final product.

In BETWEEN THE FOLDS you will meet various types of artists as they display their expertise with art craftsmanship from creating special paper to various styles of origami.  Now where all of this comes into play is that with origami as the children are creating these shapes they are actually learning about geometry and other high levels of math.  As the development of origami is evolving children are learning and creativity is heightened.
If you want to see a great documentary that offers beautiful shapes and dimensions while seeing how the children learn math by merely folding paper BETWEEN THE FOLDS is ideal.",1449360000,,1165,4.883248730964467

3960383,3,B002NWRMO0,"I expected to learn more tangible connections between art and science, but instead this documentary merely showcases the works of a handful of artists, mathematicians, and  scientists, who share a common interest in origami. Apart from a statement at the very end, made by a father of one of the subjects, there aren't many (if any) correlations between art and science being directly explored in this film. This is simply a showcase of various origami sculptures, interwoven with insightful commentary from professionals and enthusiasts from the arts and science fields.

That said, as a film that is simply about origami, it was pretty fascinating. The sculptures were incredible. It's difficult to fathom how some of those constructions come to look or behave the way they do. Specifically toward the end of the film, there are some truly impressive and awe-inspiring pieces that, according to the creators, are supposedly quite simple to make. It blows my mind to imagine creating something like that would be 'simple'.

Overall, if you are interested in origami or art in general, this could be quite enjoyable for you. If you're expecting to learn about the similarities between art and science, look elsewhere. Worth watching in your free time, or perhaps playing for an art/math class if your a substitute teacher. ;-)",1353024000,,1326,5.12962962962963

How can we as a society push the limits of our creative potential in a variety of media? In what was does art and practical engineering intersect?

All in all, I was blown away at the things people are capable of making these days, and the details in many of the models pictured and filmed is out of this world! It is great to finally see some film on how origami has influenced so much of everyday life, no matter what corner of the world you live in. My only issue with this is one of the ""artists"" they focused on. We all know that origami is the art of *folding* paper, yet a sizable portion of this video focused on this guy who doesn't fold the paper, he kinda barely bends it (picture a pringle potato chip), and that's it. Personally, I found that whole section of the video to be a waste of time~ Whenever it comes up, thats when I go hit the head, refill the drinks, or find something else to distract me so I don't throw a boot through my TV.",1322006400,,903,4.107344632768362

3960411,5,B002NWRMO0,"A single sheet of paper + some of the world's most brilliant minds = art you wouldn't believe. This was an absolutely brilliant and stunning look at an art form with which most of us have little familiarity, and that is part of what makes it so intriguing. I originally selected to view it with the mindset of, ""Huh, that might be interesting."" Never did I expect it to capture my attention like it did. A truly fascinating film!",1321228800,,429,4.443037974683544
3960412,5,B002NWRMO0,Very much enjoyed this short and fascinating film. The time spent looking at both the art and the science (and how the two are connected) was consistently fun and informative.

3960414,5,B002NWRMO0,"""Between the Folds"" is absolutely beautiful.  The people featured here are beautiful.  The ideas are beautiful.  The artwork is beautiful.  This documentary and its subject matter point way beyond themselves, and speak of an intangible beauty infused with mind-blowing, creative order that speaks of the universe itself, as well as many subsystems within the universe (i.e. biology, mathematics, etc.).

""Between the Folds"" has put thoughts in my head that are affecting the way that I understand life, the universe, and all that those two things encompass.  Amazing is not a strong enough word for this film and the people and ideas it contains, and cannot contain.",1314316800,2,666,5.235849056603773
3960415,5,B002NWRMO0,"A very nice little documentary, doing a good job of looking at the subject (origami) from many different angles, investigating both the technical and artistic aspects. The camera work, editing, and music all worked well together along with the narration.",1313884800,,254,5.375
3960416,4,B002NWRMO0,"Well done overview of the origami world from an artistic perspective. The mathematical accomplishments are glazed over, but still presented. The engineering applications are only spoken of briefly while there has been much work accomplished in that field. In general a must see for anyone remotely interested in origami.",1310515200,,320,5.551020408163265
3960417,5,B002NWRMO0,I love the artistry of origami and this documentary showcases the different stills of origami from various origami artists around the world. Plus I loved learning about the history of origami as well as the mathematical and scientific applications of origami.,1306627200,,259,5.341463414634147
3960418,5,B002NWRMO0,"Every now and then you watch a movie in stunned silence.  This is one of those.

It covers many kinds of origami and features many types of personalities.  You will come to realize that you either are a folder or you are not.  You will realize why these kinds of minds are critical to NASA and package manufacturers.  You will see art and science, left and right hemispheres merged into a unity.

You will never look at a sheet of paper the same way again.",1306195200,2,456,4.305882352941176
3960419,5,B002NWRMO0,"I was skeptical about spending an hour watching a film about origami, but I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It is definitely more than just about paper-folding. It's about the intersection between art and science. It is about beauty in simplicity and a passion for something as deceivingly simple as origami.

After finishing this film, I am inspired to learn more about origami, how it can be used to teach geometry, and instruct scientists to find cures to diseases - sounds like an odd set of inspirations, I know.  Yet the film does a surprisingly good job of folding all these subjects (as well as others) together.

It's just one hour of your time, but you'll end up feeling satisfied that you learned something new. You'll also want to tell your friends about it.",1304467200,3,780,4.762962962962963

3960421,5,B002NWRMO0,"This documentary is a real gem. Who would have ever guessed that origami could successfully capture my attention for a full hour? Not only that, it was fun to watch and left me wanting to learn even more! Vanessa Gould masterfully reveals the dynamic and surprising aspects of origami. This is not an art for art's sake type of film. The director shows how origami has very practical applications in education, medicine and physics yet still retains a very playful nature.",1295740800,9,472,4.839506172839506
3960422,5,B002NWRMO0,I was entranced with the origami and its relationship to mathematics.  It is visually stunning.  You sit in awe and wonder how they can make all those folds and come up with a complex figure.,1292544000,,191,4.428571428571429
3960423,5,B002NWRMO0,"Vanessa Gould shows you that origami is not just for amusing children. It is art, competition, math, and physics. Many times I was wowed by the artists' creations - and their process. Paper can be so much, anything really! Makes me want to create something. Or rethink the things that I already create.",1283472000,2,302,4.716981132075472
3960424,4,B002NWRMO0,"I have been folding for about 6 years and enjoy engaging others in this activity. I had seen some snippets of the video but was pleasantly surprised when I got to watch the whole thing. I purchased the edition (from PBS)  which allows for public performance and displayed it during the lunch period of a county schools' science teachers workshop. Everyone who stayed really liked it. The DVD presents the wide range of possibilities which origami provides: an art form which may extend to creating your own paper, a mathematical/physics challenge which benefits scientific fields like space travel, a mental exercise to develop spatial skills in students, etc.
  I have led origami folding projects with many people, from making paper doves to decorate a church in Nicaragua for a wedding, to a day's worth of middle school social studies classes using real origami paper to make a three-dimensional figure. I can't wait to use this video as a preface to next year's groups - whoever they are!  Catherine Carr  DeLand Florida",1279843200,,1025,4.970760233918129
3960425,5,B002NWRMO0,"Much more than I could have ever imagined, Between the Folds chronicles the stories of ten fine artists and theoretical scientists who have abandoned careers and scoffed at hard-earned graduate degrees--all to forge unconventional lives as modern-day paperfolders."" The simplicity of origami is that it allows everyone the opportunity to create their own interpretation of the world we all share -- through paper. An art form that is not only revolutionizing contemporary art as newer generations of practitioners redefine and exceed traditional perimeters.  Mathematicians like Erik Demaine, associate professor of MIT, are also using computer based models of origami to study how to save lives...

By trade, I am a mixed media papermaker. Director Vanessa Gould says: ""At its heart, Between the Folds is a film about potential. The potential of an uncut paper square. The potential of a wild scientific idea. The potential to see things differently..."" ...And that's exactly how I came away from the viewing. ...Feeling like the only limits on my art are the ones I place there myself.

Between the Folds has won several awards and is being called  ""Filmmaking at its most wondrous. ... breathtaking."" . . . ""A riveting feast for the eye and mind"" . . . ""Mesmerizingly beautiful"" . . . ""Exhilarating"" . . . I think it would be a great edition to any collection. Especially for teachers of art or math. I also found it interesting that besides being the director, Vanessa Gould is also a pianist and artist. The ability to cross disciplines gave her great sensitivity in filming the project. Beautiful imagery as well.

3960426,5,B002NWRMO0,"When most of us think of origami we think of what?  Usually it's the ""cutey catcher"" from grade school or the ""crane"".

Between the Folds takes one to a new dimension in exploring origami and its use of paper in the 21st century.  From its use in grade schools in Israel as a venue to teach geometry, to a successful physcist who retired early to pursue a career full time in origami, to the whimsical work of a french man named Joisel, this film leads one down the proverbial rabbit hole of Alice and explodes into a world that most of us never could imagine in our wildest dreams.
