8658778,1,B00KH6JM7E,This product doesn't play on typical US DVD players. It should be written on the headline. Not everyone looks at the product description or the reviews. Very disappointed customer.....,1456876800,,184,5.379310344827586

Beware! This is a rip-off!
By Hurm on 11 May 2015
I bought this set for the DVDs and they are absolute crap. The discs are about half an hour long, so everything could have been put on one DVD. What you get is a few of the usual talking heads we recognize all too well from the ""Inside..."" series by Classic Rock Legends. But this is far worse than most of the DVDs in those series, because the fragments of Kinks performances are overdubbed with some anonymous rock 'n' roll instrumentals. Probably they expected copyright troubles.... The book looks fine: lots of nice pictures on a big LP size format and a track-by-track description (the writers call it 'analysis' themselves but most of the time that's to much honour) of their albums until 1980 and a short history about what happened after that. By far not worth this money, though.

The material is already on other DVD's and the overdubbing by a 'dodgy' copy band is crap! I tried to send it back to LuvfilmLuv

This is absolute rubbish. The material is already on other DVD's and the overdubbing by a 'dodgy' copy band is crap ! I tried to send it back to LuvfilmLuvmusic but they would not accept it as they said it was not defective. It certainly was in my eyes. I wish that I had not accepted it in the first instance!
