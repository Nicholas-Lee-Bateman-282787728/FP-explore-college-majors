8324907,5,B0009IGXJA,"What can I say about Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds?  I never watched it when I was  a kid, maybe because it was never broadcast in the U.S. when it was made,but I sure love it now.  I like the stories, even though one can see little connection between all of them.  A few little jumps and skips, but that was probably my player.  But even so, I still love the series.  I hoped it was longer, but nothing lasts forever.  I bought the first series and  to find the second was good as the first was a breath of fresh air.",1352937600,,524,4.068627450980392
