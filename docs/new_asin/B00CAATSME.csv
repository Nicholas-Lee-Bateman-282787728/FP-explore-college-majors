absolutely the worse film of all time. no doubt about it.
It is not funny, it is played out so how in the world did some people give it 4 and 5 stars? If this movie is enjoyable to you then you need help. Id rather work in an African diamond mine for a year than watch this movie again......WoW!",1368230400,5,402,3.9146341463414633
5709279,1,B00CAATSME,"I would just like to start by saying that this is the first and only movie I have ever walked out on at the theater.

The PG13 rating is perfect for Scary Movie 5 because the audience it targets is definitely younger teens. The humor isn't witty or clever in the least but the younger audience was dying with laughter (12-14 year olds). This makes me wonder if the original Scary Movies were equally as bad and I was too young to notice? But I'd like to think at least the first two films in this series were funny.

The opening scene with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan was terrible which was them in bed doing a spoof on the Paranormal Activity movies. And the following spoof of 'Mama' was equally bad and when I decided I had seen enough.

I would say this qualifies for the worst movie I've ever seen. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone ever, not even my worst enemy.",1368057600,5,879,4.315151515151515

Scary Movie 5 - the continuation in a long line of mindless drivel. The first two (and arguably even the third film) in the Scary Movie film series were entertaining. Riffing on famous films with low brow humor, they were absolutely hilarious. However, this is not at all near the calibre of those films. In those previous films, there'd be one film parodied with slight nods to other franchises in a humorous manner. However, in this one - SPOILERS - there is no plot. It's just haphazard attempt to parody numerous movies that were out in 2009. So not only is this film 3-4 years too late, it just flat out IS NOT FUNNY.

It was a painful movie to watch and even worst to think about after the fact. Save yourselves the headache - if you want a good parody film, I recommend Scary Movie I and II. Pretend this crap doesn't exist, don't buy it, don't rent it and maybe for once Hollywood will let it die.",1366934400,7,1218,4.384955752212389
5709282,4,B00CAATSME,"Scary Movie is back after 5 years and I saw it as early as I could in theaters. I didn't think it was the best of the series but still was a good spoof on some of the latest horror films. I agree about the other review how it had a different tone and had more dark humor in it. It mainly focuses on Paranormal Activity but also quite a bit on Black Swan, Mama and Rise Of the Planet Of The Apes. I can't believe how many people dislike the Scary Movie franchise, I even find it a bit underrated. It's not a masterpiece but just great dumb, hilarious spoofs. The pg-13 rating should've been R due to a high amount of sexual content (no actual nudity though) and language. Scary Movie V was mostly enjoyable throughout and delivers many great laughs.",1365984000,13,748,4.2377622377622375
5709283,3,B00CAATSME,"will someoen agree with me. if you like these kinds youw ill probably like it, ifyou hate these kinds, don't waist your time. i was looking forward to this for a while. i liked its sick, dark, slappstick humor but the only thing that really disappointed me i thought by previews, i thought by interviews, charlie scheen would of been in it more, oh well, i liked how morgan freemans voice narrorated it, i liked the humor my wife is not in to horro flicks and she laughed not even having a  clue what half the titles they spoofed off of, i had to tellher most of them and now she kind of wantin to see some of what was being poofed she alughed so much. we liekd it, we liked 1,3 and 4 the best, i liked this, i just thought charlie scheen would of been in it more anyone agree with thisa t all?

it's part of the franchise if i had to pick i say part  2 wa the worse if it was my  opnion, again it was funny, stupid, silly, just plain dumb but ""FunnY"" wish scheen was in it more other than that i give it a  6, 7 on a slapstickish scale",1365897600,3,1036,3.9615384615384617
5709284,1,B00CAATSME,"Let's do the bottom line first:  parody films are the scourge of the film world.  The comedy parody is the cheapest, most worthless form of entertainment in all of film.  Quite simply, they give movie-making a bad name and simply try to cash in the success of other films.  Now, this particular response is mainly due in large part to the abysmal, horrendous parody films in recent memory  - including, but not limited to Movie 43, The 41-Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It, and A Haunted House.  Now, that's not to say all parody films are bad.  On the contrary, that are are select few parody films that a classics - including Spaceballs, Hot Shots!, The Naked Gun, and Scary Movie.  Does the original Scary Movie film belong in that club?  The honest answer is probably not yet (give it more time to appreciate in value), however, if you compared the massively successful Scary Movie to newest sequel in the series, Scary Movie 5, you'll see exactly how far the franchise has fallen in terms of quality.

Typically, this is where the synopsis for the film enters the review - but when you're dealing with a parody film, there's absolutely no plot to be had.  From beginning to end, Scary Movie 5 mainly attempts to follow the Paranormal Activity plot-line where there is an evil presence in a ""normal"" suburban home and the residents try to videotape the evil inhabitants.  However, Scary Movie constantly veers off course to mock various other films, including Black Swan, Evil Dead, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Inception.  Although this film is technically a sequel, previous main cast members Anna Faris and Brenda Meeks exit the franchise and make way for Ashley Tisdale and Erica Ash.  However, Charlie Sheen (briefly) and Molly Shannon both return after stints in previous sequels.

There's really no other way to say this:  Scary Movie 5 is not funny.  For a film to be labeled a comedy, one would assume there's laughing involved.  Easily the worst in the series, Scary Movie 5 completely misses the mark, often trying too hard to create something out of nothing.  If you saw the trailer and thought there might be some hope for the film, you're not alone.  The problem is Scary Movie 5 is one of those films that used all of its best moments in the trailer - including the brief appearance by Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan, both of whom are only in the opening scene and were obviously brought in to tastelessly dupe people into falsely buying tickets for the movie.  Not only were they strictly in the opening scene, but there is absolutely nothing to take away from that scene, other than the sad state of their personal lives.  Sheen shows off his sex tape collection, while Lohan goes on and on about her court date the following morning.  It's a completely lackluster and disappointing interaction between the two, especially since the general public is already mostly aware of their constant battles with the legal system - and virtually don't care anymore.

It's often hard to find a silver lining in a parody film, but if one exists in Scary Movie 5, it has to be the acting of Ashley Tisdale.  Surprisingly, she plays her part well - even if she is less effective than the absent Anna Faris.  It was announced relatively early that Faris would not be returning to the franchise (and who can blame her), but Scary Movie 5 was obviously written with the assumption that the Faris/Meeks tandem would be reprising their roles.  For the diehard Scary Movie fans (assuming they exist somewhere), it's a pretty devastating blow to be without Anna Faris, the face of the franchise, for the first time - yet, Scary Movie 5 almost feels like a parody of a parody with Tisdale/Ash doing their best Faris/Meeks impressions.

Occasionally, there are brief moments of sunlight in this monumentally dull film.  In one particular scene, the main lead - Ashley Tisdale treats her cell phone as a means to discover whether or not she's pregnant by using an ""I-Preggers App"" - which she urinates on, and then immediately answers an incoming call.  While the scene isn't overly amusing, it does serve its purpose to make fun of the way society relies on smartphones to give us the majority of our information.  Oddly enough, Scary Movie 5 has far too many of these smart moments and not enough laugh-out-loud funny moments, with the majority of its cracks being either too dimwitted or too intelligent for their own good.  Either way, the film suffers greatly due its complacency.

Overall, the Scary Movie franchise continues to struggle without the Wayans brothers - and even more so due to the restriction of a PG-13 rating, which the franchise adopted for Scary Movie 3 and beyond.  The film is filled with an endless amount of sex, drug, and celebrity references, and even though the film was able to attain a PG-13 rating, it's still unsuitable for kids and simply mind-baffling how a film of this nature wasn't given an R-rating.  Do yourself a favor and skip this film at all cost - and if you have kids, make sure they skip it, too.

5709285,5,B00CAATSME,"I grew up with the Scary Movie franchise. I've always welcomed another sequel. This new film was actually pretty funny, but has a very different tone to it. Anna Faris and Regina Hall are gone, but Ashley Tisdale does a fairly decent job leading the movie. The main spoofs are Paranormal Activity, Mama, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Black Swan, and Evil Dead. Tisdale stars as Jody Sanders, a woman married to Dan (played by Simon Rex from Scary Movie 3 & 4) Jody and Dan adopt Charlie Sheen's kids, who have been hiding in the woods with 'mama' When they move in to their new home, they notice ghostly paranormal activity. Jody teams up with her ballet partner, Kendra to find the Necronomicon and try to defeat Mama.

5709320,2,B00CAATSME,"Not every scene in this 5th sequel is Hillarious, some of the scenes are plain stupid and not much funny at all
No Anna farris for starters, Ashley Tisdale replaces her in the film
where she tries to be funny when she's not well not really anyway, Anna farris did a better job in my opinion
no Leslie nielson he passed away back in 2010 tragically
and no Anthony anderson
so the magic is gone from this 5th film hence movie's ending at 70mins and the credits start rolling
where is the Duration on the back cover says 86mins, i found that confusing
it turns out the last 10-14mins is just the outtakes/bloopers from the film mixed in with the end credits

the first 4 scary movies were definitely the best written & best Directed spoof films
for this 5th film, either writer David zucker was trying to hard to be funny or
the replacement actors in the film like Ashley tisdale were trying to take over Anna faris role
it really is a matter of opinion
as for the special features
there's no behind the scenes footage or interviews with the cast & crew for some reason
no audio commentary by the Director
all you get is lots of Deleted scenes & some extended scenes from the film
which is very poor effort from Miramax
so maybe 2 stars based on lack of special features & lack of extremely funny scenes",1436313600,,1300,4.371900826446281
5709321,3,B00CAATSME,"For all of the Scary Movie fans, including me, there could be a feeling of disappointment and uncertainty of how Scary Movie 5 was handled. After Anna Faris and Regina Hall disagreed to return for the fifth installment of the Scary Movie series, High School Musical star Ashley Tisdale returned to the scene as the main character, Jody Sanders, who, at first, doesn't fare well with motherhood. When Jody Sanders and husband Dan Sanders, who Simon Rex portrays, take in three children, demonic spirits enter their new suburban home. Horror movie references from Mama and The Cabin in the Woods, to popular movies from Rise of the Planet of the Apes to Black Swan, center around Jody's determination to end the curse.

Although there are a few laughs from time to time, Scary Movie 5 does not meet the expectations of fans and critics. The parodies and scenes that are intended to show humor seems repetitive, eerily similar to the previous installments in the franchise. The plot and the characters, meanwhile, don't seem to match very well. The characters are very erratic and there is lack of development. Most parodies, also, seem unnecessary, such as the Fifty Shades of Grey reference. Ashley Tisdale and Erica Ash, who portrays the carbon copy of Brenda Meeks, tried too hard to replicate the roles of Anna Faris and Regina Hall.

The fifth installment, also, is overwhelmed with star-studded cast members: Lindsay Lohan, Katt Williams, Teen Wolf's Tyler Posey, Bow Wow, Snoop Dogg, Mac Miller, Mike Tyson, and the reality TV stars, Big Ang and former Real Housewife, Sheree Whitfield. Most of these stars, of course, seem entertaining in the movie than the main characters, but the film continues to overdo characters with popular or infamous stars to bolster the film's plot.

Overall, the movie was okay; it brought a couple of laughs, but it didn't meet the expectations all Scary Movie fans wanted, and the concept and movie choices were poor. The Mama, Cabin in the Woods, and Black Swan parodies didn't dominate the interesting parodies of The Exorcist in Scary Movie 2, or Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer in Scary Movie 1, The Ring and 8 Mile in Scary Movie 3, and Saw and The Grudge in Scary Movie 4.",1434672000,,2226,4.821989528795812

I watched the opening skit with Charlie Sheen and Linsey Lohan which was semi-funny. Then the rest of the movie started. I sat stone faced for 15 minutes then figured out what the problem was - I was sober. So I made myself 4 vu-dews and put them in the freezer. I started watching the movie again and to my surprise it started getting funnier. Eveything started getting fuzzier after my 4th vu-dew. I woke up on my livingroom floor about 6 hours later and my TV's screen saver was running. I think I actually watched about 60 minutes of the movie before passing out. About 59 minutes too many. Before this movie, the worst parody movie I have seen was Disaster Movie, now Scary Movie 5 is the worst parody movie I have ever partially seen.

The antics of the ""Mama"" character, and the little girls made me laugh.  Watching the sex scene at the beginning between Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen was hilarious!  It was like watching an old episode of the Benny Hill Show!

There were spoofs in this movie that actually worked themselves into the plot and actually advanced the plot rather than just being there to be funny.  Like the book from the Evil Dead movie, the ape from Planet of the Apes, and the ballet from the movie Black Swan.  They were funny but also actually helped the storyline.

For example the evil dead thing was over the top I loved the remake of ED but it just did not work in a spoof at all.

I also missed Anna Faris presence in this entry Ashley was okay but Anna could have really brought it home.

For the most part it seemed like Ashley was simply phoning it in and overacting.

Simon Rex was hilarious in certain parts and horrible in others.

The supporting cast were so so at best including the stereotypical angry black girl who wants too get too the top no matter what.

I found the housekeeper up until near the end of the movie however hilarious she was one of the funniest ones in the entire movie.

The Black Swan spoof was a waste of time and space a horrible horrible spoof of that movie.

I found the beginning pretty hilarious with Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen basically spoofing themselves.

Overall though for the most part this entry was simply a wasted effort and it shows that the creative waters for this franchise are running dry at this point.",1417046400,,1278,4.395744680851064

I cannot put my finger on this one. It mocked some horror movies I have heard of. It had the occasion male juvenile humor in it. It had the outlandish gags. But it was just not funny. It was filmed in such a way that it reminded you of that one where those kids film it with a hand held. Dunno. And that guy who plays the lead looks so old and kinda creepy old man now. And whoever that girl was that played the lead is so ugly. Why was she chosen? She offer to do it for free? I'm sure there were other prettier and more talented actresses than her who would have volunteered. Dunno. Just was a not a good one.

If you aren't a fan of the series already,this one probably won't win you over - but for fans of the series,they should be right at home

The Zucker/Proft duo aim the next installment at Paranomal Activity,Rise Of The Plantet Of The Apes and Black Swan, sans Anna Faris but with a healthy cast of Scary Movie regulars and cameos. The absence of Fari's wide-eyed Cindy might be a drawback,but it also frees the movie from serving her storyline (a laughable fact of the series,known to retcon characters deaths from previous sequels). A certain wight is lifted and it feels fresh to have a new lead in the likable Ashley Tisdale. Its also nice to have Simon Rex back in a supporting role after a mere cameo in part 4.

Charlie Sheen,Terry Crews,Kat Williams,Snoop Dogg,Mac Miller,Molly Shannon,Jerry O'Connell,Lil Duval,Sarah Hyland,Darrell Hammond,Lindsey Lohan and others join the fun. Sure..some jokes fall flat,and theres a fair share of juvenile humor-but it is Scary Movie 5,not Hamlet...this should be expected.

Have you seen 1-4? Did you like them? Ok then..see SM5. It will remind you of that movie about the cabin in the woods. Whatever the name of that movie about the cabin in the woods was. ;)",1406678400,,1292,4.890410958904109

5709377,1,B00CAATSME,"When Scary Movie 5 came out, for some mysterious reason I was excited for it. I really enjoy Scary Movie and Scary Movie 2 but didn't care much for the third one and never even bothered to see the fourth so it makes no sense why I wanted to see it. Then, I found the reason, it is directed by Malcolm D. Lee who directed the absolutely hilarious action satire Undercover Brother. Maybe, without David Zucker the franchise can get back on track but I was dead wrong. This is the second worst comedy I have ever seen. This comes close to number one but I have a feeling that spot is going to be held forever by Disaster Movie.

Scary Movie 5 is filled with terribly unfunny gags, painful acting, and is just simply unbearable to sit through. It is filled with unfunny cameos as well, everything is unfunny in this movie. Modern spoof movies are just plain horrible and this one justifies that case even more. Luckily, it seems that not many people pay for these unbearable spoof movies anymore which is absolutely a blessing. There are no positives about Scary Movie 5 even if you are a diehard fan of Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Lohan, or Ashley Tisadle(Who Is?) avoid it at any possibility.

If you liked Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Date Movie, Dance Flick or any of those gems go ahead and check Scary Movie 5 you are probably going to have fun.",1405641600,8,1360,4.457831325301205

I knew this movie was going to be rough, but this was just awful..... A poorly done spoof film, that went south starting with the 1st terrible scene. I'm not even sure I cracked a smile at this garbage. One can only hope there isn't a Scary Movie VI. So here we go with the evaluation.

SCRIPT:
I could probably guarantee my review has more words and less misspellings!

FX:
Get ready for a re-used ape costume, the ""Ring"" character (AGAIN), a moving wig and a sh*tty banana.

ACTING:
Cameos galore. Yes, lots and lots of cameos!!! The celebs are just lining up to let everyone know that their careers are over!

Yup, get ready to see your favorite celebs and Scary Movie regulars come together to act out the most poorly written scenes in comedic history. You'll be greeted with such jokes as ""The Poopie Pie"" and ""The Chair Having Sex With The Microwave"" and ""Flinging Feces"" and ........ well that's about it.......

Movie spoofing of horror movies, less bs.",1383350400,,476,4.375

5709477,4,B00CAATSME,"Mostly spoofing and parodying the well done ""Mama"" and ""Cabin in the Woods"" as well as other modern horror genre films and their overuse of the same hooks (pun) over and over again. I should give accolades to the Morgan Freeman sounding narrator spoofing - had me fooled. Morgan's science docs will never be the same.
Spoofing of the following:
Any desolate cabin in the woods with hanging dead animals and mysterious object (book in this case).
Flickering lights; moving household items although I don't recall the customary opening/closing doors.
Floating/suspended people.
Inanimate objects coming alive - pool vacuums (and their regular vac friends) in this case.
Shadowy figures moving in the background.
Shadowy figure tends to be female with long dark hair.
Excessive number of cameras placed to see every corner of the house.
Rec symbol in the corner.
Loud, including the tiresome banging, noises.
Possessed and/or wild animal like kids.
Helicopter view of lone car moving along country road. Next to ""no cell phone service"" this visual is the second most overused hook in suspense/thriller films. But their parody was, for one scene, to substitute a toy car. Loved it!
My criticism, which mirrors some of the negative reviews, is that it seemed to get a little slow and redundant at times - could have used more memorable knockoffs from other films.",1378166400,,1358,5.066964285714286

5709484,2,B00CAATSME,"Of all of the films in the Scary Movie series, this one is by far the biggest disappointment. The familiar cast of characters and any pretense of plot continuity have been flushed down the proverbial celluloid toilet in favor of a new cast of unlikable characters and no real plot to speak of. They don't even seem to have stuck to the premise of just making fun of ""scary"" movies anymore. Now, the targets are any movie that they think they can get a cheap laugh out of. For the most part, it doesn't work.

The whole segment with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan falls totally flat. Lohan (pre-rehab) just comes off as more of a bad actress than a comedian. Sheen simply isn't given any decent material to work with. Throw-in some cameos by Snoop Dog/Snoop Lion and lots of other celebrities that can't act and you get a mish-mash of half-assed comedy sketches that normally would not rate enough laughs to make it as a sketch on Saturday Night Live.

The film did have its moments at times, but as soon as it felt like things were starting to turn around another round of bad acting, bad writing and lack of any interest at all in the main characters would bring everything to a screeching halt. Based upon the previous movies in the series, I really wanted to like this movie. I'll give it two stars for the director, cast and crew trying to make the best of a bad situation (i.e. the script, loss of main characters, having to work with Lindsay Lohan, etc.). As a stand-alone movie, forgetting that it is part of what was once considered a classic franchise, it barely deserves that good of a rating though.",1377907200,2,1611,4.494880546075085

It constantly insults the audiences intelligence. I know, I know, it's a spoof flick but Its like they didn't even try. The previous films revolved around a central storyline with pop culture and slapstick comedy. This film was a stream of fart/butt jokes that had no structural integrity. I have seen all of the movies parodied, but they did an awful job. Honestly I can't stand the over-hyped paranormal activity series- of which there are hundreds of parodies already. Lohan has really messed up her face and she looks 10 years older that Charley Sheen in the opening scene. Also it was glaringly obvious that the script was written for Cindy and Brenda- from the writing its clear why they decided mot to do the film.

Having said that, this one just was bad.  It didn't even have the normal Scary Movie type feel.  Ashley Tisdale was very hot in it of course, but not having Anna Ferris, Regina Hall, Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart, was disappointing.  There were a couple times I laughed out loud, but for the most part just sat there.  But as I mentioned, the feel was just not there and if there is going to be a #6, I really hope they go back to at least how #3 and #4 were done.  1 and 2 were great but the Wayans Bros. gave up this series.

The story was just extremely boring and bland.  It is mostly about the movie Mama with the other big movies being Paranormal Activity (which was just because of some of the camera shots) and Black Swan which just made no sense.

5709505,3,B00CAATSME,"Scary Movie 5.  It starts off with Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan in bed together.  If that terrifying image is not enough to scare you off, read on!

This movie mostly spoofs the horror movie ""Mama""  - so if you want to get the most out of Scary Movie 5, be sure to watch the movie ""Mama"" first.  Scary Movie 5 also loosely spoofs Planet of the Apes (the current one, of course) and Black Swan.  (I didn't see Black Swan, but I don't think that really mattered).

Anyhoo.....did I enjoy the movie?  Well, I suppose in a way...I did get some laughs out of it....it wasn't boring....and YET....something didn't quite feel right.

I think this particular installation in the Scary Movie series had a darker humor to it than the others.  Also, this movie does not have Anna Farris...the nave bumbling lovable star of all the other Scary movies...and THAT I think, is where it fails the most.

Anna Farris had a charming innocence about her...she was, basically, a nice person, and you rooted for her as the main character.  Now we have Ashley Tisdale as the ""star"" - and she is not likable at all.  Not that I blame her - it's the writing that's at fault, of course.  But she plays a sort of trashy, unlikable, unfriendly person who you really DON'T root for, at all.  And this, I believe, is the main reason why the movie just doesn't have the same ""feel"" as the others.

A lot of the humor is indeed the same in Scary Movie 5 as in the other Scary Movies - (***WARNING***: This movie is NOT for young children - plenty of sexual references!!!).  So yes, there is definitely humor - just no Anna Farris.

Should you see the movie?  Sure, it's worth seeing at least once - especially if you are a fan of the series.  But perhaps you want to put off buying until you actually see it.",1377388800,,1780,4.3689024390243905

Number 5 builds primarily on the film ""Mama"" but also incorporates the Paranormal series, ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Black Swan,"" Madea, ""Evil Dead,"" Inception,"" and ""The Help,"" plus a few I might have missed. The Zucker humor in this film is no different than previous films relying in part on crudeness and slapstick.

The best part of this film was the beginning as Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan joke about their real life and have a sex scene out of a Benny Hill episode. Unfortunately they die after opening scene and do not appear again outside of some doctored up photos.

This is not a film you must rush out and buy. It can wait for a price drop...like a 5 pack for $5.00.

5709514,3,B00CAATSME,"So we wait for years for a 5th movie and when it finally comes out, we get a few laughs, but in the end, overall it's the weakest of all the series. Many said 3 and 4 where bad because the Wayans brothers did not create them, but I think people appreciate them more now because they realize who actually made those and what parodies he was involved with many years ago. It does take 3 to make a classic, true, but on his own with new friends at the plate, 3 and 4 has been seen as different to the first 2, but in there own way, a great part of the whole franchise. This time around however Zucker decided to kick back and let someone else take the helm. Although he was still involved, I think this movie clearly shows where and what he was involved in compared to the other guy who's claim to fame was ""Undercover Brother"".

Plot: HAHA, if you can call it one. Charlie Sheen himself dies and his kids go missing in the woods. His brother gets word they are found and brought back to society, but they have gone rabid and brought Mama back with them. End Plot. I think the first thing that has confused people is that Sheen has been in parts 3 & 4, and was killed off in 4. But now he is back, but not playing a character, he is playing himself. His supposed real life brother is played by Simon Rex who played his brother in Scary Movie 3 & 4 but is now playing someone else who is supposed to be his real brother, but only in the film. It's kind of confusing for some, but I suppose if you can look at the logic that Star Wars 1, 2 & 3 are actually 4, 5 & 6 and 4, 5, & 6 are really 1,2 & 3, and now that Disney have the franchise, they will make parts 7, 8 and 9 which are really going to be 10, 11 & 12 to avoid any confusion about it. Anyway, no one seemed to mind when one of the Wayans was killed in the first Scary Movie and was one of the killers in the end, but came back alive in the second movie like nothing happened. So it's not the first time the franchise has done this. Oh, and Brenda was killed in every movie. Kind of like a Kenny from South Park thing. Only now the names have been changed to shame the guilty.

Anyway, enough jibber-jabber. This film takes a spoof on Paranormal Activity and Mama for the most part. Throw in Black Swan, The Evil Dead and Inception and you have Scary Movie part 5. There is some good stuff in this movie. I actually saw this before I saw Mama and Evil Dead, and it did cause me to laugh at those scenes once I realized what they where making fun of. It's not all that bad of a movie, worthy of seeing once at least, and it does actually have a much better ending than Mama in my opinion.

I think what let so many people down was the expected Anna Farris to at least make an appearance. Well, she was written into it, but could not do it due to pregnancy. But oh well, she'll probably pop her face into part 6 somewhere.",1377216000,,2875,3.9965217391304346
5709515,1,B00CAATSME,"To say Scary Movie 5 is a step below the other entries in the Scary Movie series would be an understatement. It's actually six feet under the rest of the series. I might have laughed five times. Actually, they were more like giggles. One critic was right. Scary Movie 5 makes the underwhelming A Haunted House look great in comparison. There were scenes in this movie that actually made me feel ill, such as a fired maid offering Simon Rex a poop pie, a poop sandwich, and poop banana. I would rather watch a compilation tape of Justin Bieber sitting on the toilet defecating than sit through Scary Movie 5 again. I'm sure it wouldn't be as crappy!",1377129600,2,648,4.5

5709517,1,B00CAATSME,"""Scary Movie 5"" must be some kind of psychological experiment. Perhaps the filmmakers sat in a lab, rubbing their temples while wondering aloud how awful they could make a movie and still score at the box office.

It's the only reasonable explanation for this lazy, boring, vile and tragically unfunny attempt at a horror-film spoof that is sure to kill brain cells and may signal the impending apocalypse. It's the kind of movie that leaves audience members partially lobotomized, exiting the theater and muttering absently to themselves, ""How on earth did this movie get made?""

The answer: cheaply. Each of the increasingly terrible ""Scary Movie"" installments has enjoyed an impressive return on investment, so it's only logical that producers want to keep making them, quite literally, ad nauseam. The cost-cutting is evident, between the not-so-special effects and the amateur editing errors, including a casual relationship between dialogue and moving mouths.

Thirteen years after the first ""Scary Movie,"" this new chapter follows the same general template, with one exception: This incarnation kicks off with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, playing themselves, preparing to make a sex tape.

From there, the story skips to couple Dan and Jody, who inherit a trio of youngsters after the demise of the kids' dad. What follows shouldn't be confused with a plot; it's more a series of snippets in which the characters borrow familiar story lines from other movies, including ""Mama,"" ""Inception,"" ""Black Swan"" and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes.""

But ""Scary Movie"" doesn't really put any kind of twist on these familiar plots, so much as present them in some brainless context. But stupid doesn't necessarily equate to funny, and that goes for Heather Locklear, dressed as a pregnant ballerina whose water breaks all over a male dancer's face as he lifts her above his head.

The movie is so appalling that even a film fan who guffawed her way through ""The Aristocrats"" would feel nothing but a deep emptiness as the end credits begin to roll, wondering if one solid joke was too much to ask from a movie that bills itself as comedy.

But no, there's nothing worthy of even a small smirk. Instead, the movie serves up violence against man, woman, child, doll and ape, not to mention sexual situations involving a German shepherd, a hairy, overweight nanny, Santa Claus, an automatic swimming pool cleaner, a pony and a microwave. A knock-knock joke told by a 6-year-old would be funnier than this endless stream of flatulence jokes, feces-infused food items and gratuitous vomiting.

For some reason, watching this movie kept conjuring up the voice of Smokey Bear intoning ""Only YOU can prevent forest fires."" It must be a sign from beyond that we -- the film-going public -- have the power to end this. As long as people keep watching these inept films, the ""Scary Movie"" franchise will thrive and reproduce. And that is a truly terrifying prospect.

Anna Faris and Regina Hall are gone, but Ashley Tisdale does a fairly decent job leading the movie. The main spoofs are Paranormal Activity, Mama, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Black Swan, and Evil Dead. Tisdale stars as Jody Sanders, a woman married to Dan (played by Simon Rex from Scary Movie 3 & 4) Jody and Dan adopt Charlie Sheen's kids, who have been hiding in the woods with 'mama' When they move in to their new home, they notice ghostly paranormal activity.

5709520,2,B00CAATSME,"I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of Scary Movie V for review.  Here it is:

We are all familiar with the silliness of the Scary Movie franchise, so one would think we already know what we are getting ourselves into before viewing another Scary Movie installment; however, what we get with Scary Movie V is really just immature and juvenile slap-stick comedy.

Scary Movie V has its moments where I actually laughed out loud at a few things, but then the movie seemed to just keep dragging on and repeating a lot of the same stuff, i.e., when someone gets hit in the head with pots and pans.  Usually, a comedy is supposed to move fast and keep you laughing throughout most of the movie, not making you beg for it to be over.  Clocking in at 88 minutes long, Scary Movie V was just too long of a movie and should have been only cut down to 30 minutes as that's about when it started to lose its luster.

Some of the movies that were parodied in this installment were Black Swan, Paranormal Activity, The Cabin in the Woods, and Inception among others.  We even see a Fifty Shades of Grey parody in the movie, which was interesting, but many people probably wouldn't get the joke if they haven't read the book.  Although Scary Movie V has an all-star cast of comedians who have been part of some extremely funny movies in the past like Charlie Sheen, Katt Williams, Molly Shannon, Mike Tyson, and Snoop Dogg among a whole list of others, it still wasn't enough to save this movie from being such a train wreck.

Overall, Scary Movie V was just an okay comedy movie.  It certainly isn't one of the better movies in the Scary Movie franchise and probably shouldn't have even been made.  Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the Scary Movie series, I even like the fourth one as well, and that's probably where it should have stopped.  I give Scary Movie V an overall rating of 2/5 stars because, although it was a disaster, I still got some pretty good laughs out of it within the first 30 minutes of the movie.  Some people like this kind of comedy, and I do as well, but it just dragged on too much throughout this film.  Scary Movie V is definitely worth checking out yourself so you can make your own judgment.

Overall Rating:  2/5 stars

Nevertheless, there are plenty of laughs to be had as the plot progresses rather rapidly while engaging quick scenes of true hilarity. Acting is great, believable. Special effects are well done.

The movie makes ""Movie 43"" or ""Disaster Movie"" look like master pieces! And the fact that they obviously tried to replace Cindy and Brenda with bad copies for potential sixth and seventh parts(Jody and Kendra) made it sink. Ashley and Erica tried too hard to be funny, while Anna and Regina didn't had to try a lot. I just wish Dimension would had waited for Anna Faris (she was pregnant at the time this was filmed), because perhaps, the movie with her would had been WAY better. No one can replace Cindy and Brenda! There's no Scary Movie without them. Also, Simon Rex's performance was painful to watch. He should quit acting. If he thinks he was funny in this movie, well he's not! All the funny moments of the movie are seen on the trailer, the other ones are just the typical physical humor jokes or tasteless comedy. At least the other Scary Movies were stupid and with physical humor sometimes, but they were funny!

Another thing that annoyed me is that they parodied more drama movies/TV shows than horror movies (isn't Scary Movie known for parodying HORROR movies?).

5709535,3,B00CAATSME,"Director Malcolm D. Lee (The Soul Men, The Best Man) took a formula story of parody with characters originally created by Marlon and Shawn Wayans, Aaron Seltzer and others - and a final script by Pat Proft (Real Genius, Police Squad) and David Zucker (Airplane, The Naked Gun) and had some fun making fun of films like `The Help', The Cabin In The Woods', Paranormal Activity, Black Swan and `Rise of the Planet of the apes'.

As the fifth in the line, the comedy is simple and the jokes are always not as obvious, but in `Scary Movie 5' its Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan who have a really funny opening scene of making of a `sex tape' of themselves. Without saying too much, it literally goes over the top and both Charlie and Lindsay obviously have no problem making fun of themselves as well. It is probably the best bit in the film.

Ashley Tisdale (High School Musical, Suite Life) and Simon Rex (Scary Movie 1,2,3 & 4) play a mother and father who obvious have a house with issues. The movie centers around the two of them realizing and then dealing with the `ghostlike' problem the house is having. People like Snoop Dogg, Mike Tyson, Mac Miller, Big Ang and Sharee Whitefield all make cameo appearance of themselves. All are exaggerated, but definitely making fun of themselves.

Overall it's a video movie for me because the previous films were a little funnier to me and had more gags.
