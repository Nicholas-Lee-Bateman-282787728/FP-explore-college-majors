3514314,5,B001CMZF46,"The How'd They Build That videos are great for kids of all ages.  I have several different ones, which I obtained for my[...] nephew.  His favorite was the fire truck and garbage truck videos.  After seeing them, he wanted to (a) become a fireman and (2) drive a garbage truck.  This kept my nephew's attention the whole way - highly recommended!",1240358400,2,346,4.622950819672131
3514315,5,B001CMZF46,"This video was fascinating for both children and adults alike in our test group.  Viewers are taken on a personal tour of Seagrave Fire Apparatus plant and learn exactly how fire trucks and rescue vehicles are assembled.  This plant has been designing, constructing and assembling the toughest trucks for 125 years.  They are the very best in the business and you get to see how they do it.

When a customer orders a vehicle, they use computerized 3-D technology, which enables them to see every item on the vehicle before production begins.  Amazingly, there are 1800 to 2500 different parts on each vehicle.  At Seagrave, many of these parts are still hand-crafted.  For this reason, it takes 1500 to 3500 hours to build a single fire truck.  No vehicle is allowed to leave the lot without extensive testing to prove its strength, stability and safety.

The plant tour is interspersed with interesting fire engine facts, such as the difference between fire trucks and fire engines.  Fire engines, or pumpers, primarily pump water to extinguish fires, while fire trucks carry ladders, tools and specialized fire equipment.  This video does a great job of explaining the components of a fire vehicle and exactly how those parts are assembled.  It's put together in a fun, informative way, and would make a terrific gift.  Did you know there are 125 different colors to choose for a fire vehicle - but 92 of these are variations of red?  You would if you had watched this video.",1227225600,5,1477,4.8326693227091635

3514318,3,B001CMZF46,"My son loves watching the manufacturing process. He has the ""How'd they Build That"" videos for garbage trucks, school buses, and concrete mixers. The problem with the fire truck video, according to him, is that there is little actual manufacturing--the video shows the trucks in action more than the actual making of the truck.",1346976000,,327,5.074074074074074

3514320,5,B001CMZF46,"My 3 year old loves this DVD. The music, narrator's voice and the extra bonuses like ""School bus"", ""Cement Truck"" and ""Military planes"" were of a great surprise. I ordered two different DVDs. One was How'd They Build That ?...Fire Truck, the second was ""Diggers and Dozers"" by Mighty Machines. To compare the quality of the How'd They Build That ?...Fire Truck to the latter is way higher. The information is little too much for a kid of 3 years old.

3514324,5,B001CMZF46,"My 3-year old daughter loves firetrucks and is constantly saying she wants to be a fireman. We viewed the ""How'd They Build That"" video together, and I was amazed at how it captivated her attention with its visually engaging ""inside look"" for nearly an hour. This is a quality video...well produced...that explains and illustrates the different styles and purposes of several fire fighting vehicles. My daughter especially loved the vehicles in action scenes, and before we had finished watching...my 16-year old son was equally enthralled with the stimulating presentation and fun facts the program delivers. I would recommend this video for a broad age range of viewers. I enjoyed it and learned from it as well. Very pleased!",1256860800,10,728,5.177966101694915
