4153140,5,B003LJNC98,"I was so excited to get Playball because it meant I can have Patrick at home with me when I could not get to the gym to take his classes. Being a busy mom means being on the run all the time and squeezing in my workouts. This workout out is fun and challenging. And the best part is I just need three items - a ball, water and my towel. This is one video workout which does not bore me. Patrick has great energy which is a motivation with in itself.",1273968000,,449,3.891304347826087
4153141,5,B003LJNC98,"This video is amazing! Patrick makes the hour fly by by creatively structuring the work out like a basketball game. I even got my fiance to work out with me with this video.  The moves are doable but challenging. We got into shape using this video for cardio and another Patrick Goudeau video for strength/cardio. I want to try all the other videos now! Doesn't hurt that Patrick is funny, toned, and in crazy shape.  We did this video in our living room with just a ball! No coordination necessary, just need a sweat towel! I have to admit that the first couple of times we did this video by the 4th quarter I was a spectator just trying to catch my breath but now I can for sure PLAY BALL!!!  Highly recommend this video!",1273708800,3,723,4.340740740740741

8399687,5,B003LJNC98,This is a terrific workout for beginners (which is what I am). I was told to start doing some strength training and a friend recommended getting a medicine ball. This video is fun and a great introduction.,1368230400,,205,4.5675675675675675
8399688,3,B003LJNC98,"I was hoping for more medicine ball based movements...instead, it felt more like aerobics with a ball in your hand.",1347408000,,115,4.8
8399689,3,B003LJNC98,"This is an effective workout that'll make you sweat, but it bothers me when instructors repeat the exact same moves to ensure ""symmetry"", when the exercises themselves work bilaterally anyway.  For example, I've never done a workout where the entire floor/ab routine is repeated - you're doing crunches etc with your legs pointed to the right, then later on you'll repeat the same thing with your legs pointed to the left. This happens several times throughout this workout, and while I understand that it's about doing reps, I do like more imagination and it feels lazy to me. It makes the 30 min pass more slowly that it should, because it's like once you've done something on one side, you know exactly what comes next...that's fine, and I love it if it's something that focuses on one side at a time, but when you are doing something which works both or alternates L and R in the same move, it feels lacking in variety.  I own about 40+ fitness dvds, and this one is notable for that repetitiveness.  Other instructors who are repeating the same thing on the other side sometimes do make a slight change to keep it interesting (eg backward lunges on 1 side with bicep curls, then when you do the other side, you might do overhead presses).

Having said that, it is a different way to do cardio with resistance training which doesn't rely on a dumbbell (I think I prefer a kettlebell workout though).

Also, I was concerned that you'd need a ball which could be bounced off a hard surface given the dvd says it uses basketball drills, but in fact you don't, so I could use the non-bouncing 4lb vinyl ball I already had (from one of the Firm kits). But I think a rubber medicine ball would be easier to hold and grip.",1331683200,,1719,4.514469453376206
8399690,5,B003LJNC98,"""Play Ball"" is a challenging and athletic workout which includes  work on coordination, skill and balance.  Patrick Goudeau uses a six pound medicine ball and the two ladies each use a 4 pound medicine ball.  You also need a small, clear space.  This is a short and fairly fast moving workout of about 30 minutes.

So, this workout made me sweat and I finally put good use to one of my medicine balls.

8399692,5,B003LJNC98,"Great overall workout, especially for the core.
 I paddle dragon boats, so I was looking for something to get me into a good general fitness level that I could build off of. The workout is fun, and leaves me sweating, but not too hard that I couldn't do it. I use an 8lb hard med ball for most of the moves, but for some use an 8lb soft med ball that is smaller in diameter. My hands are too small to grip the bigger one for the one handed moves.
 This video is fun, and up tempo, and I actually enjoy doing it! To me, that's the most important part. Patrick makes the time fly by.
I highly recommend it!",1315267200,,604,4.025
