4702031,4,B005HK8KY6,"If Amazon ran the rest of its business the way it runs its reviews, the company would be in bankruptcy protection by now. Having just purchased this DVD (NOT Blu-Ray ), I received the customary invitation to write a review before I had even stripped the cellophane off the case. Clicking on the icon accompanying the invitation and accessing the previous reviews, I quickly learned that they were 6 in number, ALL devoted to the Blu-Ray version. Faced with the historic task of preparing what seems to be the VERY FIRST evaluation of this product, I could only marvel at the enthusiasm of my half-dozen predecessors, their erudition, the pains they took with their critical analysis of every detail and indeed every note in this vast score, the clarity with which they expressed their conclusions, and the near-identity of the latter to my own. This last point only goes to show that anyone who bought the much more expensive Blu-Ray version must be an idiot, or has too much money to burn! Unless .... Well I will get to that in a moment. Firstly, this is a magnificent symphony that is leaps and bounds above Mahler's ""Titanic"" 1st, and in my view has not been surpassed by any of his later works. Indeed, I very much prefer it to the 4th, 7th and 8th. Secondly, the performance is utterly brilliant in every respect. Chailly and the Gewandhaus Orchestra have never before reached such heights individually or in combination, and I have seen and heard them apart several times and in different locations. The chorus sings like a choir of angels, exactly as they are described in the text, and the two lady soloists do a fine job ---- Sarah Connolly moreso, perhaps, than Christiane Oeize ; she has after all more to sing about, and Mahler seems to have written more eloquently for the contralto voice in most of his works. The Gewandhaus itself is an awesomely inspiring location that I was unable to see during my only visit to Leipzig in the 1990s because there was nothing on at the time, but the splendid camera work brought it alive in all its glory, as it enlivened every possible aspect of this performance and its performers. I can thoroughly recommend it unless ...... and here comes the rub. The recording adequately captures the silky tones of the strings, the plaintive warbling of the woodwind, and the rasping sonority of the brass. The drum-rolls come through crisply and the rest of the percussion with clarity, even in the louder passages, when the brass are taking a breather. But when brass and drums are going at it hammer and tongs as they must do in the thrilling sforzandos and fortissimo passages, much of the thrill is muffled and masked ---- replaced by a dull reverberation in which the various forces cancel each other out instead of complementing their respective sounds. Mahler is a delightfully capricious composer whose music is replete with more dramatic contrasts than almost any other symphonic writer. He can accelerate from pianissimo to fortissimo in the space of seconds, but somehow the acoustics of this recording are unable to accommodate these extremes in a satisfactory manner. I had the same complaint with the Mahler 9th by Abbado and the Lucerne Festival Orchestra that the same team ( Smaczny and friends) also recorded for Accentus ( not Blu-Ray). Yet, I never found this to be a problem with their work with the latter group for the EuroArts label. What is going on here? Is it DVD versus Blu-Ray? Or  Accentus versus EuroArts? We won't know until the six gentlemen whose Blu-Ray reviews are inappropriately credited to the DVD version tell us whether they have actually made the former comparison. If there really is a significant difference in sound quality between the two versions, then the additional price of the Blu-Ray is probably justified. Either way, the reviewers should exercise ethical responsibility by withdrawing their reviews from this disc. They simply replicate what is available immediately above under the Blu-Ray disc, even down to the identical order. If they do not, they will be colluding with Amazon in outright misrepresentation.",1329091200,5,4109,4.878397711015737
4702032,5,B005HK8KY6,"All of a sudden, in this centennial year of the death of Mahler, there are now four Mahler Seconds on Blu-Ray.
ABBADO's Lucerne performance of 19/20 August 2003 was the first to appear on Blu-Ray.  There was a sound problem with the initial release, but it has been fixed.  My copy forms part of the boxed set of the first seven symphonies, where the First and the Second are combined onto one disc, the Third and Fourth on another, the Fifth and Sixth on another, while the Seventh is sole occupant of another disc.  It is wonderful to have all the Mahler symphonies out on Blu-ray already so early in the life of the format, and the bulk of them presented by Abbado's handpicked Lucerne players.  The contributions of Berlin veterans like clarinettist Sabine Meyer and flautist Emmanuel Pahud are highlighted in the Second, and their presence is missed in the First, which was recorded later.  The blu-ray sound of the Second is astonishingly better than on the prior DVD release, and reveals one of the greatest performances of this work in our time.  The performance and the disc are so perfect that it would have seemed like hubris to attempt another release.  Yet three fine competitors have surfaced almost simultaneously.
CHAILLY's Leipzig performance of 17/18 May 2011 formed part of the first annual International Mahler Festival, along with a performance of Mahler's Eighth.  The two symphonies both require large choral and orchestral forces, so there was practical advantage to having them both while the participants were available.  The chorus masters Howard Arman, Simon Halsey and Gregor Meyer were certainly busy with rehearsals leading up to the festival, as the results testify.  Ten years before, Chailly produced another outstanding high-resolution audio recording of this symphony, with the Concertgebouw; it was released both as a DVD-Audio disc and in a CD boxed set with the rest of the symphonic cycle.
GILBERT's New York performance of 11 September 2011 took place on the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks.  In addition to the capacity crowd of 2646 people inside Avery Fisher Hall, a large screen outside in Lincoln Center Plaza accommodates a larger crowd, among whom are family members of the fallen.  The conductor gives an impassioned introductory speech which has many audience members in tears, along with yours truly.  In some ways the speech upstages the performance of the symphony.  At least it certainly highlights the tragic and courageous aspects of the score, as opposed to the light touches, which are manifold.  The performance certainly has a sense of occasion, and the choice of piece is particularly appropriate in view of the fact that Mahler himself conducted this orchestra in this piece on 8 December 1908.
BOULEZ's Berlin performance of 26/27 March 2005 makes a somewhat belated appearance on Blu-ray, after already having incarnations on DVD and HD-DVD.  There is no way to compare with the latter, but the Blu-ray sound is a big, big leap from the DVD, which sounded anemic in both LPCM stereo and DTS.  The LPCM stereo on the blu-ray sounds vastly better than the corresponding stereo on the DVD.  To my ears the multi-channel sound on the Blu-ray is too bass-heavy (one of the microphone set-ups must have been near the basses), but others may prefer it.  The occasion for this performance was the 80th birthday of the conductor, but unmentioned in the program notes is the fact that it was also near the 110th anniversary of the work's premiere, which took place right there in Berlin.  So the Berliners conscientiously step into this piece as heirs to those who created it.
Of course the complete Abbado set is must for the Mahler fan, but the other three performances of the Second are so fine that they too rise to the level of the indispensable.",1322092800,9,3816,4.942097026604069
4702033,5,B005HK8KY6,"I just finished listening to this performance of Mahler's 2nd Symphony and I can't wipe the smile off my face! Not only is the Blu-ray fidelity absolutely perfect, but the video quality and tastefully well-informed camera angles/close-ups are icing on the cake.

The surround sound is glorious, faithfully reproducing the acoustics of the performance hall. The audio is crystal clear; I didn't miss a single note.

The *only* thing I would have done differently would have been to emphasize the final movement's off-stage ensembles in the rear surround speakers to make full use of the technology (although some might argue that would be a ""gimmick"" that could distract the listener since it wouldn't represent how those off-stage ensembles actually sounded in the concert hall). But that's not a criticism of how the off-stage ensembles are heard in this recording; rather, it's just a personal preference I've always wanted to hear in a Mahler's 2nd recording. Oh, well :)

Everything about this presentation is classy and in service to the music. And what music it is! I grew up with the Gilbert Kaplan recording with the London Symphony Orchestra, and have never found its equal. While I still prefer Kaplan's interpretation (and could only dream of his version being presented with the fidelity and dynamic range of this Blu-ray), Chailly's glorious performance on this disc is still breathtaking.

Note that some consider Kaplan's version(s) to be too academic and not musical enough. But since his was my first Mahler 2nd, Kaplan's was the one imprinted on my brain for better or worse. Happily, Chailly's tempos are very close to Kaplan's, so listening to this recording was like visiting an old friend who got better with age.

Regardless of whether you prefer Kaplan, Bernstein, Solti, Walter, Mehta, Klemperer, or someone else, this Blu-ray featuring Chailly and the Leipzig Gewandhaus will knock your socks off.

If you like Mahler, get this Blu-ray. And that recommendation is coming from one of the pickiest, most opinionated, impossible-to-please perfectionists to ever troll Amazon.com's reviews!",1318809600,20,2112,5.233727810650888
4702034,5,B005HK8KY6,"We have been fortunate in excellent Mahler 2's, although Abbado is the sole Bluray competition for this disc. Boulez has a wonderful dvd only release. Bernstein's very old release with the LSO is not up to the rest of his Mahler series.

Right out of the gate, let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers. The stupendous sound is a thing of wonder, just like it is on the companion Mahler 8 from the same conductor/orchestra. I have never heard this piece played where the percussion was, well, so percussive! I felt like I was thrown back in my seat. And not just the percussion. Every instrumental line is heard in crystalline clarity. The singers are both first class, easily as good as Abbado's, which is saying a lot.

My only reservation is the basses and cellos at the very opening of the symphony. They are not as ""in your face"" as in Abbado's version. Those old enough to remember the 60's and 70's DECCA recordings of this piece (Solti, Mehta) will know what I mean. The impact of of those first few bars in those discs was immense (as compared, say, to versions on EMI or Philips). But perhaps this disc is more realistically balanced. No matter - this current disc as a whole has no peer.

The video quality is superb, as is the camera work. If you have a bluray player, buy that version.

 All movements are interpreted well, with enough little nuances to differentiate Chailly from Abbado.

I see that the New York Phil. with Alan Gilbert has another version of this coming out, on the same Accentus label. Should be interesting, but I can't imagine it being as great as this. I guess we'll find out.

Don't hesitate on this disc - it's amazing!",1318118400,14,1679,4.539735099337748
4702035,5,B005HK8KY6,"From the opening bars this performance grabs one by the throat and never lets go. Abbado set new standards with his magnificent Blu-ray set of 1-7, (not the 9th unfortunately), but this is even better. The quality of the camera work, the colour balance, the overall artistic design and an outstanding performance make this a very special disc. I rate it the best orchestral Blu-ray disc in my quite large collection. Abbado is wonderful too and the performace differences are small and personal, but the production design and recording team have made greater strides with this recording. Magnificent. The individual instrument camera work is brilliant. I did not care for the paper pack which I suspect will not last that long but that is a minor quibble.

There are trailers for other works notably the nuclear-powered 8th if that is to your taste, (not mine I must confess), and it would appear to be just as good based on the 4 minute sample. My only regret is that with Abbado's splendid set on release how much nicer it would have been to have had say Shostakovitch's 4th or perhaps Schoenberg's Grrelieder, works that would respond so well to performance standards like this. No need to hesitate if you do not have the Abbado and even if you do this is hard to resist!",1317600000,21,1274,4.713004484304933
4702036,5,B005HK8KY6,"This is a live Blu-ray recording (DTS HD DTS Digital Surround PCM Stereo) of a May, 2011 performance of the Leipzig Gewandhaus, conducted by Richardo Chailly, feturing soprano Christiane Oelze and mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly.

It is beautifully photographed, with the cameras and editors showing a superb understanding of being in-close on the right instruments at the right time. It's a great way to see where what you're hearing is coming from.  And the sound in this performance is as beautifully recorded as the images!

All sections of the orchestral parts are excellently done. The timpani sounds are incredibly good, both when loud and soft, they are dramatically impressive. Rarely will you hear the harps so clearly! Yes, in the Urlicht, the trumpets are muted with cloth covers over the bells.

Early in the 3rd movement, the ""St. Antonius von Padua preaching to the fish,"" we get an excellent opportunity to see the rutes in action--and you can hear them in this recording far better than in any others I've heard.

Chailly is alert, ""alive,"" and totally involved throughout the entire performance.

In the Urlicht, Sarah Connolly sings passionately, with each syllable perfectly timed and precisely articulated. I wouldn't change a note!

In the final movement, at the ""Unsterblich Leben, wird, der dich rief dir geben,"" the soprano, Christiane Oelze is right on with every note, sung with expressiveness, without falling prey to the excessive vibrato that sometimes is noted at this point. If you are a Mahlerian, I don't think you can hear her ""und sammelt Garben uns ein--die starben"" without tears filling your eyes--and your soul. That's what Mahler, done well, does to many of us. It's an experience to carry you to heaven.",1317340800,18,1742,5.091228070175439
4702037,5,B005HK8KY6,"Five stars seem hardly enough to rate the technical qualities of this disc. The picture quality is as sharp and clear as you could wish, but it is the phenomenal sound which almost beggars description. This is demonstration quality sound par excellence - a valuable plus point in a recording of this work. Abbado's 2003 Lucerne performance sounds spectacular, and still holds its own sonically against its rivals, but the improvements in recording technology over the intervening period have been exploited to astonishing effect on this disc.
But what of the performance itself?
Chailly uses a larger choir than Abbado, and the choral singing is as good as on the Abbado disc, but whereas Chailly's choir look like any choir one might see at a concert, Abbado's singers are dressed in monk-like robes and are more rigid and austere in their movements, adding to the almost religious feel of his performance.
The soloists on the Chailly disc adopt a more dramatic style than those on the Abbado disc, which suits Chailly's dramatic interpretation. In contrast, Abbado's soloists are more ethereal, stressing beauty over drama. For example, at the end of the first and second verses of the Aufersteh'n hymn, the voice of Abbado's soprano (Eteri Gvazava) soars effortlessly out of the choral background, whereas Christiane Oeize's entrance on the Chailly disc is much more evident and emphatic.
Chailly pauses (and moves off the podium) at the end of the first movement, in line with Mahler's instructions - it is at this point that the two soloists come onstage.
In the first three movements there is little to chose between Chailly and Abbado. Sarah Connolly(Chailly) and Anna Larsson (Abbado) are both good in the brief ""Urlicht"" movement, Larsson adopting a slightly more tender delivery.
The start of the last movement is almost literally shattering in the Chailly performance, more effective than in the Abbado performance not least because of the sound quality on the Chailly disc. From here on however I feel that Abbado captures more magic in the music as the ""redemption"" themes are introduced - he molds the phrases more than Chailly, whose approach to the music is a little more straightforward. This difference is enhanced by the filming: in the Abbado there are consciously constructed fade shots and soft focus effects at key points in the music (when the offstage brass first make their entry, for example) which suit Abbado's more spiritual interpretation. The camera work in the Chailly is more straightforward - this is a record of a concert performance.
Again, the state of the art sound enhances Chailly's ending of the symphony, but (that apart) there is little to choose here between Chailly and Abbado, with the latter perhaps conveying a little more ""release of joy"" at the very end.

The Chailly performance is magnificent by any standard (and unmatched in sound quality). Its obvious rival on disc is the Abbado Lucerne performance - also magnificent. Buy both, for their different approaches to the symphony. When you want to be thrilled go with Chailly, but when you want to be moved choose Abbado.",1317340800,47,3124,5.042553191489362

8473187,5,B005HK8KY6,"I recently compared this Blu-ray with those by Abbado and Boulez and with the Bernstein DVD from a 1973 filmed performance in Ely Cathedral. I won't go into any detailed review of the Chailly inasmuch as there isn't much more to say after all the wonderful reviews already here. If there was any problem sonically with the DVD version, I have to concur with the comments of others here that the sound on Blu-ray is the best audio I have ever heard anywhere. I simply want to concur with the overall enthusiasm for this extraordinary production and to offer up some impressions from the 4-way comparison I made.

Best orchestra: The Lucerne Festival Orchestra, hand-picked from the best of Europe, including a strong infusion from the Berlin Philharmonic.

Best mezzo: Janet Baker in the Bernstein and Petra Lang in the Boulez.

Best sound: The Bernstein is simply not in the running. The Chailly is the most impressive without being overbearing; the Abbado, perhaps the most natural.

Best conducting: This is nearly a four-way draw, but I would narrow it down to Bernstein & Abbado as slightly preferable.

Best video: While all 3 Blu-rays are equally clear, the lighting and locale of the Chailly provide an especially pleasing and interesting view. If you like the old-fashioned warmth of film, you may like the Bernstein in spite of its low resolution. The Abbado is set in the visually uninteresting Lucerne Culture and Convention Center.

Among the four, the Chailly is my second choice; but this is a really, really close call for me; and, as everyone listens with different musical sensibilities, it's really impossible to recommend one over the other based purely on the interpretation. Although I think Abbado has a slight edge in this respect, the production values are better with the Chailly; so it all depends upon how heavily one weights the (possibly) marginally more poetic rendering by Abbado against the stunning sight and sound on the Chailly.",1421712000,3,1963,4.969512195121951

8473189,5,B005HK8KY6,"Chailly is THE Mahler guy for this moment in time. The LGO is on fire, beginning with the amazingly exciting first movement. The playful simplicity and charm of the second movement waltz is in direct contrast to the thunder that subsides at the end of the first. Mezzo Sarah Connoly is splendid and the chorus is spot on. This performance is a must for those who like their Mahler with the pedal to the metal!",1409097600,,409,4.466666666666667
8473190,5,B005HK8KY6,"I am an audiophile first, a classical music lover second.

Is this the finest interpretation of Mahler's Second ever, probably not.....It is, however pretty damn good.

Of greater significance, the utterly astounding audio/video quality of this production.  I'm in the business, and this disc could be considered a ""Master Class"" in the proper lighting, direction and sound production for a multi-channel concert recording.  The lighting is superb, the sound mixing is easily ""best in class,"" and the HD image quality, well it's like you're looking out a window, not at your plasma screen.  Let's just hope for the DTS-HD-MA 5.1 your amplifier can handle it.  This disc wants to be played loud!

Do not hesitate, this is one of the finest discs in my sizable collection.  I'm considering buying a second, just so I have a spare!  Enjoy with a glass or two of exceptional whisky, you won't be sorry.",1366416000,4,898,4.933333333333334
8473191,5,B005HK8KY6,"I bought this as a second, and alternative, Blu-ray version having already got the re-processed Abbado version which is excellent in every way now that the earlier sound problems have been addressed.

The first thing to state unequivocally is that both the performances as conducted by Abbado and by Chailly are equally fine in concept and delivery. They also share orchestras that are well able to fulfil every demand made of them by both Mahler and their respective conductors.

The interpretations are, of course, different in their intention and execution.

As a guide it is perhaps relevant to observe that the layout of each orchestra is somewhat different and perhaps a visual example/demonstration of the overall interpretive difference. The Abbado orchestra is spaciously spread over a large area with lots of working space for the players and this is very much the concept of the interpretation. By contrast the Chailly version has a much tighter and more traditional layout which again reflects that interpretation. The soloists in both versions are equally fine.

I found the Chailly version compelling, exciting and totally satisfying in what could be loosely described as in the traditional way whereas I found the Abbado version more overtly emotionally uplifting as a concept. The Chailly version could therefore be described as perhaps more of an outstanding main-stream view and the Abbado version more of a personal vision. Both are compelling.

On more mundane matters however, there can be little doubt that the Chailly issue has the advantage as a recording. The imaging offers greater definition whilst being equally sympathetic to the players and the music. The sound is of demonstration quality. The Abbado, though good, is not quite of that level and this may reflect the production problems encountered, though largely resolved, during manufacture.

Mahlerites will want to own both recordings and they would be right to do so as both offer valuable and complementary insights into the music. For single purchasers the choice is more difficult but could be narrowed down to opting for either more of a personal vision as envisioned by Abbado or opting for a more traditionally outstanding interpretation as envisioned by Chailly. Both are equally excellent and certainly this performance by Chailly is worth every one of 5 stars. My personal favourite tends to be the one that I am listening to at that time!",1343520000,2,2435,5.183206106870229

8473193,5,B005HK8KY6,"I have to admit that I am rediscovering the greatest classical performances on Blu-ray or newer DTS. I am an amateur and can only state that I have enjoyed this Mahler symphony as well as 8 and 9 much more than simply listening to the CD. Mahler writes the most complex and multidimensional symphonies of anyone. It us pure joy to fully oarticipate in a symphony due to the fine directing which focuses on each relevant section of the orchestra where appropriate. I have always been deprived of this joy since I was always too far from the orchestra or the orchestra was inaccessible such as the CSO at Ravinia outdoor concerts in Chicago where you had to pay $100 for a good seat. Now I have full access to the orchestra fully emerged in the experience and I am grateful. The choral movements just glorious, picture crisp, sound beyond belief....and it is subtitled.

These newer recordings are far more enjoyable then remastered 30 year old performances.....since the video and audio quality has evolved so dramatically as has the directing.",1334534400,4,1043,4.794444444444444
8473194,5,B005HK8KY6,"The opening phrases are rushed.  Chailly sometimes rams up the turbo when we really just needed to shift into first gear.  And-- like Abbado and so many others-- the sound model here is transparency, when a little bloom and mystery (wedded to a a titanic string section)would work better.  But there's no denying the excitement achieved in much of this performance.  The first movement is a vast improvement over Abbado's bloodless cheerfest.  The second movement is perhaps the least effective effort.  But the Urlicht here is supreme, and Chailly molds the movements together brilliantly, making the joints (which apparently weren't entirely convincing, even to the composer) feel inevitable.  The sequence beginning with the Urlicht and exploding into glory in its wake puts this performance high up on the list.",1329955200,,815,5.271317829457364
