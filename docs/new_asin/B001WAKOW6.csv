3824726,4,B001WAKOW6,"I went to see ""New in Town"" because my husband wanted to see the film. I'm generally not an American comedy fan, but this one is different.

Renee Zellweger plays Lucy Hill, a bright career woman who is determined to climb the corporate ladder at Munck Foods no matter who she steps on to get to that coveted VP slot.

When Munck execs determine that a remote Minnesota factory needs to be retooled to make energy bars, she jumps on the chance to go and prove herself even if it means firing half the factory.

Miami raised Lucy is completely unprepared for a Minnesota winter.  She arrives in high heels and hose and quickly learns about boots and layering.

Blanche Gunderson (Siobhan Fallon), her secretary, also teaches her about old fashioned values including sitting down to the dinner table with the union rep and keeping things personal and real between herself and her staff.

Then there's Ted (Harry Connick, Junior), the union rep.  Naturally, he's going to be the bane of management's existence, but he's also the kind of guy to rescue stranded women out of snow drifts.

The humor's a little raunchy, think of what the Prairie Home Companion people would say if they could say what they really thought, and you might want to take an extra sweater into the theatre.  Maybe order a hot chocolate instead of the coke as refreshments.  All that snow is pretty suggestive.

""New in Town"" is an old style comedy with updated dialogue and humor.  It all works.  My husband is right.  Seriously, we might even own this one.

3824727,4,B001WAKOW6,"New in Town is a truly good comedy. The interplay between Lucy, the high powered executive played by Renee Zellweger, and Ted, the union rep, played by Harry Connick Jr, reminds me of some of the great comic pairings of the 50s and 60s, such as Rock Hudson and Doris Day.  Also not to be missed is Siobhan Fallon playing Blanche Gunderson, the Minnesota housewife and secretary.",1235692800,,378,4.641791044776119
3824728,5,B001WAKOW6,"First let me say that I am surprised that this got such a bad review here.  I went to see this movie with my mom.  I didn't know how it would be when the first past came on.  But I was very happy to have seen it when it had ended.  I think this movie is really funny if your not thinking that it's going to make you laugh the entire way through.  It gave me the feeling that I got when I was a kid watching movies that were for my age.  Does that make sense?  I think what I'm saying is that it worked perfectly.

Renee Zellweger is great.  She is so beautiful and acts so well.  She can make you laugh without making look as though she tries and she really makes you feel what her character is feeling.  I'm not sure of the last movie I saw her in.  But after seeing this, I look forward to her next film.  Harry Connick Jr. is another actor who is great.  He does such a great job of being the guy is is supposed to be in this film.  He never gives you the feeling of seeing someone over act.  He plays his part calm and cool.  For a guy who is such a good singer and actor, we sure don't see much of him.  All the actors in this movie act very well.  You get the feeling that you know them, and you can understand what they're going through.  It kind of reminded me of Fargo at first.  I hated that movie.  But I loved this one.

The movies is about Lucy Hill (Rene Zellweger), who is picked to go and restructure a factory that is out of state.  When she gets there she starts out with some trouble.  Some things happen and she sees this guy Ted Mitchell (Harry Connick, Jr.)  She Insults him and thinks he is a slob.  Come to find out he is the union rep for the company she has been sent to restructure.  She is a women who does not want any ones help.  She is from the city and that is the way she is used to living.  Come to find out her boss wants her to cut the workers by 50%!  She has no problem with this for a while.  But how will she feel as she comes to meet the people of the town?  As she lives there with them and sees there way of life, will she decide that she wants to help them?  Or will she stay the city girl, high class business women that she is, and cut their company to get higher in her own?

This movie did make me laugh.  But more importantly it really drew me in.  It had my attention fully and totally.  There are few movies that make me forget that I'm in a theater.  Few that make me forget about everything else but it.  This movie was one of those few.  I will buy it when it comes to DVD.  I look very forward to watching it again.  I hope there are others whom like this much as I.  Remember, even if people give something a bad or good review, it's up to you to decide if you like it.  So give it a chance.",1234483200,35,2747,3.8615107913669067
3824729,3,B001WAKOW6,"""New in Town"" is both a romantic comedy and a fish-out-of-water story, setups so overused that they've pretty much lost all credibility. I will not go so far as to say that this is a bad film; in fact, it redeems itself to a degree with a subplot involving corporate greed and harsh economic realities, which could not be timelier. But as far as the romantic comedy stuff is concerned, this movie gives as absolutely nothing new, and it showed no ambition to do so. It's typical boy-and-girl-from-two-different-worlds material, with an executive from sunny Miami and a blue-collar union representative from snowy New Ulm, Minnesota crossing paths and hitting it off. Even more typical is the fact that, initially, the two can't stand each other, which I guess is proof of the age-old adage that opposites attract.

The Miami exec is Lucy Hill (Rene Zellweger), who lives a comfortable life and prefers business skirts and clacky high heels. She senses a possible promotion when her company announces it needs someone to restructure one of their out-of-state factories. She volunteers before realizing that she will be sent to New Ulm, one of those middle-of-nowhere towns with a population of less than 15,000 people. When she arrives, she tries to think positively: ""How bad can it be?"" she asks before stepping out the airport door and feeling a bone-chilling arctic wind. You'd think someone traveling to another state would have the foresight to check The Weather Channel before leaving; that way, you would know to pack the right kind of clothing. Alas, no such character exists in a romantic comedy.

Lucy soon meets Blanche Gunderson (Siobhan Fallon Hogan), a woman Sarah Palin could communicate with were it not for her thick Minnesota accent. She's wholesome, cheerful, and uncomplicated, a member of a scrapbooking club who guards her tapioca pudding recipe and regularly brings Jesus into everyday conversation. Did you expect anything less from a character named Gunderson? She's to be Lucy's secretary at the factory. For a time, she's also the only friendly face Lucy will come across; New Ulm is a tight-knit community that doesn't take kindly to corporate types, especially since they're more interested in making a profit than they are in the livelihoods of the working class. Indeed, Lucy's restructuring plan involves a serious number of job cuts.

The first to voice his opposing views is the union representative, Ted Mitchell (Harry Connick, Jr.), who also serves as a tow-truck driver and a volunteer firefighter. Aside from the fact that he and Lucy don't get along, the fact that he doesn't sound like anyone else in New Ulm is a big clue that the two will eventually fall in love. Ted is originally from North Carolina; he moved to Minnesota (for reasons I won't reveal), and now he's an overprotective single dad raising a shy teenage daughter named Bobbie (Ferron Guerreiro). Lucy can help, here, not because she has children of her own, but because she knows how to dress and put on makeup, which will help Bobbie on her date to a Valentine's Day dance. There are other factors, of course, but do any of them really matter? All we need to know is that Lucy and Ted are falling in love.

As the two get closer, the community begins to see Lucy in a different light. Likewise, Lucy begins to respect the community, seeing them as more than beer drinking, ice fishing lowlifes that like polka dancing. Before long, it becomes a life-changing event for everyone. This is about as predictable as some of the film's ""funnier"" moments, such as when Lucy and Ted are out crow hunting, and Lucy has to pee in the woods but can't undo her zipper. Or when a local named Stu Kopenhafer (J.K. Simmons) and a group of coworkers trick Lucy into thinking there's a holiday called Gopher Day. Or when Lucy gets drunk after driving into a ditch and getting stranded. I guess romantic comedies need moments like this, just like they need an assortment of quirky characters. God forbid screenwriters try their hand at witty dialogue or characters with believable personalities.

But ""New in Town"" does have the factory subplot to fall back on. There are a select few moments that are actually compelling, not only because they draw on plausible economic situations, but also because they allow the characters to temporarily set aside their quirks. They even give Zellweger the opportunity to finally seem like a real executive and not just a woman who looks silly pacing a factory in high heels. If only there were more moments like this. Maybe this movie didn't need to be a romantic comedy; maybe it could have been better as a dramatic story about a small American town and the corporate entity that seeks to ruin its reputation. It wouldn't allow for anything to bloom between Zellweger and Connick, Jr., but at least the story would be much more engaging. ""New in Town"" is no better or worse than your average romantic comedy, which is disappointing. By now, I wish someone would think up a new way tell this kind of story.",1233360000,3,5037,4.845528455284553
3824730,1,B001WAKOW6,"The very first joke in New In Town is so terribly unhumorous that the film could only go uphill from there. But it doesn't. Lionsgate Films, not known for their comedies, once again dabbles with big names and risqu humor, but falls flat when it comes to entertainment. You'd think by now that such formulaic, unoriginal drivel wouldn't satisfy intelligent women, but someone keeps purchasing tickets for these types of mindless chick flicks, giving studios the incentive to keep churning them out. Just because middle-aged women are the target audience doesn't mean the movie has to be so annoyingly indistinctive.

The film opens with gossiping old nags (who are meant to be funny) chiming in with the latest bits of news, including who will be overseeing the equipment changeover at the Munck Foods factory that furnishes jobs for the majority of townsfolk in New Ulm, Minnesota. Most are set in their ways, familiar with the simple comforts of ice-fishing, caroling, and tapioca feasting, and certainly not prepared for the likes of Lucy Hill (Renee Zellweger), an executive Miami businesswoman looking for a way to continue advancing her career.

Right away Lucy feels out-of-place, irritated by her idiosyncratic coworkers and subordinates, most of whom show little respect for their new boss. Adjusting to the cold weather, apparent lack of professionalism, and opinionated residents proves to be daunting, especially when she immediately ruins relations with the local union rep, brashly fires the factory foreman and winds up trapped in a frosty snow bank during her first week. In time she warms up to the town she once despised, especially after she catches the attention of hunk Ted Mitchell (Harry Connick Jr.) and gains the friendship of secretary Blanche Gunderson (Siobhan Fallon Hogan). But just as her new life is becoming tolerable, further problems arise when the bigwigs back in Florida determine that the New Ulm facility needs to be shut down.

Gags with perky nipples, urinating in the woods, getting shot in the rear and tapioca fighting (via montage) are the brunt of the low-key humor in New In Town, which sets the mood for this frightfully generic bummer. Every single scene in the film must have been inspired from other equally uneventful comedies since nothing is original or even mildly amusing. It doesn't take much to recognize how recycled the plot is and how paper-thin the characters are - not only is there no creativity, there's also nothing to laugh at. Ted jokes after rescuing Lucy from one of her many icy predicaments: ""You're not so bad when you're unconscious."" The same could be said for New In Town if the unconscious state was bestowed upon the viewer.

Some reviewers took offense at the portrayal of the Minnesota characters.  I didn't find them laughable; I found them welcoming, honest, hard-working, & kindhearted folks.

Harry Connick Jr.  is a little of out of his league with Renee Zellweger and J.K. Simmons; the amazing chemistry, that he had with Sandra Bullock on Hope Floats, is not there to boost his performance.  (That is why I rated it 4 star instead of 5.)

Being from a small town in Montana my whole life, where it also gets very cold, I found I could really relate to the humor in this movie. A lot of the things they showed may seem to have been exaggerated, but believe me, they are true! I think I was dying laughing at the beginning of the movie with the cold sweater scene. This has happened to all most every girl who lives in a really cold climate. Also, the hunting scene with the crows was great! Again, I myself have had very similar experiences while being in the woods!
The Minnesota accents were great! I'm sure their accents vary depending where you are in the state, buy my brother in law is from Minnesota and he totally sounds like that!
I totally recommend this movie; it is romantic, laugh out loud funny, has endearing characters, is relatively clean and all in all has the makings for a great family movie.",1515888000,2,987,4.34054054054054

Well, a labor spokesman in his factory, which in most states is  seen as the next closest thing), there is no chemistry between the leads, and very little humor that doesn't come off as contrived. The funniest scenes, in fact,  are the deleted  ""trolls"" sequences, the only zany touch in this dishwater plodder, and deleted Renee pratfalls.  Strictly by the numbers and unbelievable. Note: Amazon's listing information is incomplete, there ARE bonus features on this DVD: deleted scenes, ""Making Of"" featurettes, and an audio commentary track by cast and crew (I haven't listened to this yet so can't comment on how informative or bland it might be).",1513728000,5,1097,5.24

Sure the Minnesotan's might have been a bit of a stereotype but hey folks, it's a comedy, so it's meant to be a lighthearted poking fun at the culture, and it turns out to be very sweet and endearing. It really depicts the daily grind of what it would be like to be a ""city girl"" who is accustomed to luxury to suddenly be dropped into sub-zero humble living, and boy does it make for great comedy.

And it is such a laugh working in the sweltering, stinking, dirty, steel factory making the machinery that keeps America alive. Poor schmucks have to punch the time clock for $29,000 per year.

Having lived in rural northern Montana....I understand the culture but the accents are northern Minnesota and Wisconsin.  The supporting cast is superb.  Renee Zellweger does a GREAT job as the new Corporate chief from Miami in a tiny frozen-over northern town trying to make the place more profitable, in fact she truly carries the movie.  For added humor there should have been a lot more about how people from warm climates adapt to the northern areas....always seem to wear sweaters and layers of pants, always turning the heat up too high for the others in the office, nostril hairs freezing when outdoors, car doors frozen shut, wipers frozen in place on windshields....lots of small but authentic opportunities missed for added realism.  To the nay-sayers.....this is a ROMANTIC COMEDY.  If you are in a grumpy mood watch something else.  If you are in a light-hearted mood or on a first or second date...fantastic movie.  Nothing embarrassing at all for kids to watch!  Yes, it is predictable,...there will be infatuation, at least let one very low point and in the end they will end up an ""item.""

Renee Zellweger just has the knack for comedic timing.  Harry Connick was the perfect foil for her character.  It is a predictable plot but that is why it's so good.  You can just relax and enjoy knowing there won't be some psychological harbinger of mental complexity one will spend years wondering  (if).

It may be one of the worst movies of any year. Not content to be merely inane and predictable, it is downright insulting, [and replete with humorless derision]""  ""New in Town may inspire the entire state to file a class-action defamation suit.

I can forgive a movie for being predictable (as many romantic comedies are) as long as it's enjoyable and shows a believable relationship developing between two compelling characters.  This movie did NOT do that.  It had potential, but it felt like a huge chunk of the movie was missing.  The main characters had a few not-that-interesting interactions, and suddenly I'm supposed to believe they're in love and one of them is going to make life changes for the other?

3824951,1,B001WAKOW6,"In the first 15 minutes:

We are introduced to some of the women of this Northern US town.  Their conversation seems written by a ten year old, but doesn't quite rise to the level of a ten year old.  They are gloating over how the town has managed to drive away four managers or so.

We are introduced to Renee Zellweger's character, who is somehow an executive and manager but has as little common sense as a Valley Girl.  She flies while wearing a pair of 5 inch heels and seems to think she is equipped to push a baggage cart laden with a couple hundred pounds of her baggage; and is dressed for a Florida summer rather than a Minnesota winter.  In thirty seconds, it is made clear just how little common sense she has.  Hey, I thought mid-level managers had to fly everywhere.  How did she get to an executive position and never fly anywhere before.

She meets one of the less-bright ladies we have been introduced to, who then yaps at her like some brainless dog, going on and on about her scrap books.  It seems she shares membership in a scrapbook club with those other ladies, all of whom are supposedly representative of the kind of woman you meet in northern middle America.  Personally, I think Minnesota, Wisconsin, the Dakotas, and possibly Michigan and Wyoming (and maybe all of Canada) should file suit against the makers of this movie.

And then I turned off the movie.

3825005,2,B001WAKOW6,"I'll preface this by saying that I often enjoy romantic comedies and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger as a lead, but this movie was lacking in all areas. Maybe the mid-western humor would be more enjoyable to someone from that region, but I didn't connect with it. The best character was Siobhan Fallon Hogan as Blanche Gunderson. J.K. Simmons usually steals the show, but his character in this movie was not memorable. Frances Conroy does a good job in the minor role of Trudy Van Uuden. Ted Mitchell, played by Harry Connick Jr., came off like a very basic made for TV male lead. This movie failed to utilize the full-potential of the cast. The plot is the generic and predictable Fish out of Water trope where the lead is an overworked, cold career driven city person introduced to warm, family oriented country folk trying to show that country/small town life and the love of friends has value.",1504051200,,888,4.735483870967742

It's biggest flaw was that in stuffing it so full with EVERY possible plot gag from every romance movie like this you ever saw there really ended up being no real acting in the whole movie.  It was like the Wayans brothers decided to make ""Romantic Movie 4"" and forgot the laugh track.  Zero chemistry between Zellweger and Connick.

3825008,1,B001WAKOW6,"I am willing to suspend disbelief within reason for a good story. But there is a limit, and this movie exceeds it from the beginning.

An executive is being transferred from Florida to Minnesota to take over the running of a factory. She arrives at the airport in Minnesota with a huge amount of heavy luggage all of which she lifts by herself from the carousel and swings onto a cart. In the real world, she would arrive with one bag with sufficient stuff for a few days, while her company shipped the rest of her stuff to their office in Minnesota from which it would be delivered to her hotel. If for some reason she had to have all that stuff right away, for a few dollars she could have a porter transfer her baggage from the carousel to a cart and from the cart to her rental car. It is inconceivable that a corporate executive, a relatively small woman, would do all that heavy work by herself. Then she arrives in Minnesota in the wintertime without a coat. Really? She didn't know where Minnesota is on the map and that it gets bitterly cold there in winter? She doesnt know how to look up weather reports in a destination city and doesnt have an assistant who knows? Are screen writers an extinct species?

Ill-treated by her subordinates until she begins to perform emotional familiarity and interest in their inconsequential personal hobbies, she somehow develops an attraction to their union ringleader, a misogynistic regular Joe with nary a clever thing to say nor iota of excitement to offer. After the story of his late wife's demise gets her hot, she goes in for the SINGLE kiss that eventually causes her to give up the only life she's ever known in order to move to the barren middle of nowhere and settle down with this unremarkable man, who at this point has shaved his beard and lost what little rugged hotness he did have to offer.

Simmons, most recently in State Farm commercials, utterly wasted with mostly painfully awkward and predictable dialogue and behavior. ***SPOILER ALERT***  I'm a big Zellweger fan, and more often than not she was wooden, seemingly phoning it in- in the beginning so uptight and such a witch that it put my teeth on edge- then she changes so abruptly it's simply unbelievable.  I'm also not a fan of shooting birds for FUN (particularly crows, my favorite bird).  And, I come from a long line of Minnesotans and unlike Fargo's characterizations of North Dakotans, subtle or endearing these were not.

This seemed to me like a fourth rate version of Baby Boom.  The best part of the film was Harry Connick Jr.- rugged, believable and sincere despite the shallow lines he was given.  Is this worth watching?  I thought not- I laughed maybe twice, was touched/moved not at all.

They could have made Conick a little more edgy, at least more sexy.  He's very good-looking.  They should have capitalized on that.  Overall I enjoyed the film, but it is definitely a chick flick.  I disagree with some other reviews that it was entirely predictable.  Just the ending was a little too neatly wrapped up by today's standards.

Nice story about a romance that develops between an executive and the union representative.  A big corporation from Miami just bought this yogurt plant out in Minnesota and had plans to cut 50% of the workforce, but then decided that they were going to close this plant all together because the profits continue to disappear.  This female executive, however, fell in love with the town and decided to do everything in her power to save the plant.  Most of the time spent in this movie is the executive getting to know the culture of the town.

However it is the standard ""sexist propaganda"" of a gal who is actually doing just fine for herself and loving life giving it all up because she met ""a man."" The idea is she didn't know she was really unhappy without the guy. I mean because smart women can't tell if they are happy or not until told what they feel by any random man who would know better than her, right. Plus no woman can be happy without a man, any man.

A little on the predictable side because everything turns up just perfect in the end... but getting there is a fun cinematic journey.

3825364,5,B001WAKOW6,Renee Zellweger is one of the best actresses around . I love how she plays such a sassy corporate boss in a small town. She makes me laugh in a couple of scenes. She is such a funny and badass person.,1476662400,,200,3.902439024390244

After all, they don't have to exclusively mean one must be in a heteronormative relationship. Family is so much more than who the family is made up of, after all. And there is nothing wrong with small towns. It's better to have a close knit community, after all. I grew up in a small town area, and it was nice. Only curmudgeons and cynics have problems with nice things and nice movies and nice people, after all. But whatever. It's either your thing or not.",1473638400,2,614,4.339130434782609

This movie is definitely okay for viewing with the entire family. It does not have a bunch of nudity or violence as some movies do, and it is quite comical. There is religion mentioned in the film, but it does not delve to deeply into it, so I was totally fine with it. I got this movie for mothers day, so I could veg in bed and enjoy a nice day, relaxing with a funny mellow movie. This one definitely fit the bill on that count.

Old tale of sun goddess from Miami finding herself in the frozen north. She barely understands how to survive, and finds the natives to be good ole folks, obviously not on her level. The usual conflicts arise, slowly vanquished by the undaunted heroine (Rene Zellweger). She eventually comes to love and understand them, especially one of them. But life is not that simple, and she must return to Miami. Won't spoil the ending for you. It's an easy going, entertaining movie. Enjoy",1462406400,,600,4.892156862745098

He laughs all the way through it with all the crazy things that happen in the frozen town in Minnesota to the girl from Miami.  He is half Norwegian and his family is from Minnesota so I think it reminds him of his grandparents and how they sounded and acted while he was growing up.

3825640,5,B001WAKOW6,"NEW IN TOWN is a color film about a small factory in rural Minnesota, and threats from the factory's owner to impose layoffs, and eventual threats to shut down the factory entirely.  The factory has equipment for manufacturing yogurt and similar foods, and any food scientist in the viewing audience will find delight in the cinematography taking place inside the factory, in details of automated dispensing equipment, and details of new product development.  The script skillfully and with subtlety weaves the issue of ""new product development"" into the story line, and eventually the issue of ""new product development"" eventually provides a turning point in the plot (don't worry, I do not give away the surprise ending).  This film trods the very familiar theme about an underdog overcoming adversity.  This film adds a new twist to this familiar theme, because the story concerns workers in the food industry.

ACTORS.  NEW IN TOWN stars Renee Zellweger (A-list actor), Harry Connick (famed musician and actor), and Siobhan Hogan.  Siobhan Hogan has been in about 50 movies, usually in non-starring roles.  But she had a starring role in the prize-winning THE SECRET FRIEND.  Ms. Hogan has a starring role in NEW IN TOWN and, in my opinion, she stole the show away from Zellweger and Connick.  Ms. Hogan is the very epitome of the typical midwestern village homemaker, who's goal is to be affable with other townsfolk, and to make gifts for her friends.  In this movie, Ms. Hogan makes and distributes gifts, such as a scrapbook and tapioca pudding.  Ms. Zellweger's character is that of an out-of-place corporate executive, unfamiliar with the cultural mores of her new supervisees.  Her role is to supervise and make decisions about laying off half of the employees at the food factory.  For the first half hour or so, she does a good job at being a social misfit, because of her unfamiliarity with and insensitivity to midwestern culture.  For example, Ms. Zellweger's character is clueless regarding how to dress for weather that is 50 below zero, regarding the need not to insult union leaders, about the fact that Christianity is held dear to rural midwesterners, and about how to micturate outside when one is bundled up in various layers of cold-winter garb, and how to be a careful driver on icy roads.  Although Siobhan Hogan steals the show, at least in my opinion, the strange face of Zellweger is sometimes a distraction.  Her face is naturally edematous and, at times, in this movie her face sometimes looked pathologically swollen.  Also, when she contorts her mouth in attempting to make an expression, a web of strange wrinkle lines appear on her cheeks.

COMEDY.  Although this is a fun movie, the main theme is about the constant threat of job loss at the food factory.  There are occasional bits of mild comedy, for example, when young executive Zellweger arrives in Minnesota and tries to walk through the snow in high heels, and when her high heeled shoe gets caught in a catwalk grating at the food factory.  But there is one very original and very funny moment in this film.  [SPOILER ALERT]  The funny moment is when Zellweger goes on a hunting trip in a meadow, with shotgun in hand.  It is the dead of winter, and Zellweger and her hunting partner (Connick) are all bundled up in layers of clothing.  But Zellweger needs to micturate, and in an attempt to remove her trousers, bumps into her shotgun, accidently sets it off, causing the buckshot to be propelled into Connick's buns.  Mr. Connick is taken to a hospital, and the buckshot spheres are removed from his buns.  The funny part, is the next day at the factory, all of Mr. Connick's co-workers are smiling and are wearing paper targets attached to the rear of their trousers.

NEW ULM.  Although the movie was filmed in the frigid northern reaches of Canada, the story takes place in New Ulm, Minnesota, which also gets very cold in the winter. New Ulm is a real town, located about 50 miles to the southwest of Minneapolis.  New Ulm, which was named after Neu-Ulm, Germany, boasts a German ancestry of 65%.  New Ulm bills itself as the ""Polka Capital of the Nation.""  I was pleased that one of the characters in NEW IN TOWN mentioned ""polka."" But I found it to be annoying and really weird that, in the closing minutes of NEW IN TOWN, the soundtrack provides country western music.  In my experience, it is not the case that country western music is popular in Minnesota or in Wisconsin.  Square dancing music and bluegrass are popular.  But not country western music (ick!).  I was very pleased by the fact that exhaled breath of the actors is shown as puffs of condensation.  In striking contrast, in the film ICE STATION ZEBRA, which takes place on a sheet of ice on the North Pole, none of the actors have any condensation issuing from their mouths, resulting in the annoying reminder that ICE STATION ZEBRA was filmed in the warmth of a studio somewhere in Hollywood, California.

THE MIDWEST EXPERIENCE.  This film will best be appreciated by residents of the northern midwest.  I lived in Madison, Wisconsin for 4 years (1980-1984), survived the brutal winters, and explored various remote villages, such as New Glarus, Gale-Ettrick, Tomah, Warrens, Tomahawk, Bayfield, and so on.  I was pleased that so many characters of NEW IN TOWN had a genuine Minnesota/Wisconsin accent.  In this accent, for example, the word ""flower"" is pronounced ""fluh-wer.""  The word ""snow"" is pronounced, ""snaw.""  The word ""cow"" is pronounced ""cuh-oo"" (as one syllable).  The word ""power"" is pronounced ""puh-wer.""  I was pleased with the accurate depiction of the ice fisherman, and their little wooden houses that are dragged out over the frozen lakes.  I was pleased by the mention of polka dancing.  Viewers who are not familiar with the northern midwest (e.g., Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan), would not likely appreciate this film's skillful reproduction of the midwest accent, of the condensation of breath, of the ice fisherman, and so on.",1441324800,2,6026,4.895463510848126

3825728,5,B001WAKOW6,"I loved New in Town. Renee Zellweger and Harry Connick, Jr. play so well off each other. It's a wonderful comedy/romance, hilarious at times. I found myself laughing out loud, and I haven't done that in a long time. The entire cast was marvelous, the actors so perfect in their roles. Weather played an important part in this movie and I actually had goose bumps in my cozy little home just watching all that ice, wind, and snow. I enjoyed watching the characters grow and especially Lucy Hill (Renee Z.), a Miami executive, who moves to Minnesota to oversee the downsizing of a manufacturing plant and who can't resist falling in love with the union rep (Harry C., Jr.). The movie ends well, of course, but how could it not. It has so much going for it.",1416787200,,754,4.510948905109489

Story line was ok but if I lived in Minnesota I would take offense to the fact that Minnesota people are portrayed as half wits. Believe me they are as smart as any other state. Catherine Heigl or Sandra Bullock would have been funnier for the female role.,1407369600,,367,4.333333333333333

One thing: skip the special features. There is a whole section on scrapbooking . . . yeah, they went there. And a long one involving a tapioca fight.  Would rather have had a blooper reel.",1399939200,,438,4.395061728395062

3825811,5,B001WAKOW6,"I never heard much abut this movie before I saw it on TV, but it has become a real favorite. It isn't a grand story, and certainly not a grand setting, it's charm comes from a delightful mix of characters, culture clash, and the lead characters performances, especially Rene Z. She always gives a good performance as a comedic actress and this is no exception.  It is just a warm, funny, uplifting story about unexpected romance, the little guy winning over the big corporate world, and just fun. It has become my go to movie when I need cheering up. My favorite scenes are those where Renee, from Florida tries to adjust to Minnesota culture, cold, and characters. These character parts are great fun.",1397865600,,702,4.661290322580645

This movie is one of them.  It's up there with RUDY and MIRACLE...two of my other favorites.  I can watch it over and over.

It's fun to watch the behind the scenes story included on the video also, as I lived in North Dakota 20 years, and I know all about COLD, and COLDER!!!

It's so easy to get involved in the characters of the town--they almost seem like personal friends by the end of the movie.  ""Blanche"" ( Siobhan Fallon Hogan) does such a great job!  She just loves everyone and just worms her way right into ""Lucy's"" (Renee Zellwegger) heart!  Renee does a great job portraying an almost heartless executive who's heart ""thaws out"" by the end of the movie.  I wound up giving my copy to someone because she loved it so much.

No it wouldn't win an academy award, BUT it's light, fun and very entertaining.  We all sit and quote lines and laugh.  We've made it a classic and I recommend it to EVERYONE.  My brother and his wife barrowed it, it's a movie the grand kids can watch, it's alllllllllll good.  We like all the characters and even though we know it's a movie we never think about it being a movie.  The people are very real and it's so easy to watch that you aren't exhausted by the time it's over like with some movies.

It's in a 1:78:1 Aspect Ratio which I normally don't like but with this type of film, it's o.k.  The Blu Ray & the color were really pretty nice & the audio sounded good to me, although I listen through external speakers hooked up to an older stereo. No Digital here. Still sounded good though.

To see a great actress - Renee Zellweger and the crooner Harry Connick Jr in one film, was a combination I would have never thought I would see.  I have always been a fan of Renee's since Empire Records and of course, Bridget Jones's Diary. Then to see her play in Cinderella Man which showed me that she is a well rounded actress.  As for Harry Connick Jr, he is the crooner of New Orleans and when he played a small role in Independence Day, I became interested in him as an actor.

3825912,1,B001WAKOW6,"I'm a big fan of Renee Zellweger and HCJ, so I was expecting a lot from this film. Alas it was not meant to be.

The idea of a glamorous city executive (Zellweger) coming to a small town to downsize a company and butting heads with the local union rep (HCJ) is an excellent one. There was so much potential here for a really sharp romantic comedy, but it basically fell completely flat. Why? IMO because it didn't want to tackle the real issues surrounding downsizing and corporate greed, so it went the way of condescending stereotypes and tired romcom cliches.

Zellweger goes from being a brittle corporate drone to someone with a conscience in the blink of an eye, and there are only a few lame scenes with her & HCJ before they are in lurve. There's no sparring or witty repartee to draw the reader in, or any attempt to build sexual tension. The dialogue is unbelievable and the film consists of very short scenes that don't allow you to connect with the characters. The icy landscape is very fitting because Zellweger's face is frozen throughout the entire movie, but maybe that was through embarassment at being in such a dud, and not a botox treatment gone wrong.",1345420800,7,1172,4.576190476190476

I thought it was funny.  Some reviewers' expectations seem to have been very high and then severly dissed the film, as they were so disappointed. I do not have the same expectations for every movie.  There are differnt genres in films, different purposes, etc.  I don't have the same expectation for this one as I would Lord of the Rings, Raisin In The Sun, Pride and Prejudice, Return To Me, and a host of genre videos that I own, rent or watch on netflix.  I can adapt.  Thats why I also love foreign films, many of which are very refreshing as well - no overdone expectation(s). Videos I watch do not have to be a perfect 10. I am not so easily amused, but at the same time I have different moods, reasons or entertainment desires when I watch movies.

All this to say that I loved this movie - for some of same reasons that others severely dissed it.  I was entertained by the lighthearted poking at midwest typecasts.  I have a few mid-west friends who agree. Of course its not for everyone to enjoy, but I think that I will now buy it from Amazon and watch it with my wife.

I haven't cared for Renee Zellweger in the past, and I can rarely sit through a movie these days without shutting the tv off - or falling asleep.

But this was a cute movie!  It was genuinely funny.  I will agree with others that say there was no real development with the story or the romance, but does that always have to be the case?  It was a glimpse into ""life in a northern town"".

As for the stereotypes?  ha  I grew up in the north and have recently returned to the north -and while there were a couple of over-done instances, the stereotypes really are true.  For me, that's what made several parts of the movie laugh-out-loud moments. They may be stereotypes, but they're true!

I really liked Renee Zellweger in this movie, as well as the other actors/actresses. It was well-cast. I don't know that the ending was that realistic, but probably necessary to keep things light-hearted.  Overall, an entertaining movie.",1317513600,,966,4.590643274853801

3825932,2,B001WAKOW6,"With enough years of schooling under my belt, I can confidently say that I know what a good story is supposed to sound like. A combination of believable actors, an interesting plot line, and a satisfying ending, will appease those wanting to be entertained. Uniqueness is another important quality for stories but for people who know enough about movies, the romantic comedy genre is anything but unique. Boy and girl meet, they may or may not like each other at first, possibly a fight or two occurs, and then inevitably in the end, they live happily ever after already having forgotten about the past. I'm not criticizing the genre because very often I do want to watch a romantic story with some intertwined humor, but New in Town starring Renee Zellweger and Harry Connick Jr. had neither of these elements. I wasn't expecting to watch the winner of the 2009 Oscar for Best Picture, but there wasn't a moment after the first fifteen minutes when I didn't want to just get up and leave the theater.
 Zellweger plays Lucy Hill, a Miami businesswoman who is sent to assist the underperforming food-processing branch of New Ulm, Minnesota. Her semi-memorable phrase of ""I will not get attached to this town or anyone in it"" paints a really accurate picture of her reaction to the culture shock of an old school town in the mid-North. Yes her obnoxious character contrasts well with the innocence of the older women of the town, but this gets annoying and repetitive very quickly. Their regional accents and their consistent use of phrases such as ""cutesy-poo"" and ""okey-dokey"" gets old pretty quickly. Many members, especially Zellweger's tapioca-obsessed secretary, all fight to maintain some form of dignity throughout the film. I mean really, do all the characters need to be your typical small towner who can only relate to each other?
 Apparently not, because while Zellweger goes on and on about the horridness of the town, good looking Ted Mitchell, played by Connick, arrives as the local union representative who refuses to accept her trash talk. And what do you know, they fight, and fight, and fight. But of course, Connick has to be a lonely widow with a thirteen year old daughter...how touching. How can Zellweger not fall in love with him now? Although this may seem too cynical, I wouldn't have reacted this way if the route leading up to the romantic side of their relationship was not in the slightest bit clich. Does that moment when they know each other is ""the one"" have to be when everything possible has gone wrong and they have nothing left but their ""love?""
 Of course, the film does have its witty moments, for example when Zellweger and Connick are on a crow-hunting adventure and she accidentally shoots him in the butt and the following day, the workers arrive wearing targets on their backs. Honestly, I can't even think of another example. But thank goodness in the end, she becomes a change woman and she tries to help Ted's daughter with her makeup. Yet suddenly, she comes up with an idea to save her faltering company with none other than a tapioca recipe. No, it didn't make sense to me either.
  This PG rated movie, which should be an accessible, wholesome family fun film, is nothing of the sort. Its overused storyline and bland performances are not worth anyone's time. And it's not even that the ending was so predictable because as we all know romantic comedies are, but the method of execution was poor. I'm not exactly sure what the purpose in making this movie was, but for those who will watch it (for reasons that are unknown to me), I want to wish you good luck in not booing and throwing things at the screen, because you're going to need it.",1296864000,,3692,4.735614307931571

Sadly it wasn't even made in Minnesota, it was made in Canada where they say ""Aay?"" alot.  Since I moved out to western MN, I have picked up saying ""Heh?"" (the Canadian Aay habit), but I don't say ""Ya know? or ""You betcha!"" I guess you could say this is a sore spot for me, I just find it so annoying, wasn't Fargo enough?

3825953,3,B001WAKOW6,"This is one of those fish-out-of-water romantic comedies that plays up stereotypes and over exaggerates things in the name of being funny or cute. Many people like this. I happen to think it takes away from the potential of many of these types of movies. This is the story of a hard-charging female management type from Florida who is sent by her company to Minnesota in order to lay people off and re-organize the factory. Of course she goes in the middle of the winter so we have the jarring weather along with the culture shock of being in a Minnesota. The movie includes a number of stock situations for movies like this and very little that is innovative or fresh. I think the two main characters have a bit of chemistry, but they never seem to be put in situations where it can develop much. Whenever they end up together, something else usually happens to change the focus of the action. Finally, the ending is a feel-good finale. In any case, if you like the kind of movie in which a proud city person ends up learning lessons from rural folk, you might like this movie.

of the humor.
Renee Zellweger is great in this movie. She played a big city girl to a T. She came across
as a cut-throat, there to do her job. She never suspected that she would like these people though,

3825962,4,B001WAKOW6,"I see elements of the movie Baby Boom in this film.  Smart ambitious woman gets stuck in the middle of nowhere and outside her comfort zone.  She meets a man who she at first dislikes and then comes to love.  The locals aren't that impressed with her either.  And on top of that she is forced to create and market a new product in a short time.  And both women must survive a long cold winter.

This movie is more about characters.  And we know action movies are what sell to the general public these days.  No matter how bad they are.

Renee is very funny in this film.  She does physical comedy well and also as a very ambitious woman who comes to the Minnesota town of New Ulm to modernize a plant and terminate half of its employees in the process.

She embarrases herself at her first dinner meeting with the local union rep played by Harry Connick jr.  She fires the plant manager after being further embarrased by a made up gopher day and when the manager closes the plant on the first day of ice fishing, which turns out to be a state holiday.  She can't seem to get her footing with the locals who speak as if they were all from the movie Fargo.

Along the way she comes to appreciate their lifestyle and wants to save their plant when the corporate office in Miami wants to close it.  She becomes the hero by finding a new product, marketing it and putting it in store shelves as a big hit.  Her secretary's secret tappioca pudding recipe.

The cold winter is as much a character in the film as it was in Grumpy Old Men.

Rene is charming and Harry is a great rugged guy next door. I don't want to give too much away but..if you like a romantic comedy grounded in a good backstory, you will like this movie.

3825966,2,B001WAKOW6,"One of those pointless romantic comedies, `New in Town' has absolutely nothing in it that sets it apart from the rest of the pack.  The acting is mediocre, at time excruciatingly amateur, and that script is so cookie cutter that it borrows so much from other, better films to create a complete waste of time.

And yet I'm compelled to give this two stars for the mere fact that I did laugh kind of hard a few times.

Lucy Hill is a Miami businesswoman who gets transferred to a small town in Minnesota in order to whip a plant into shape.  She is not given a warm welcome, as the townsfolk know with her she brings layoffs, but what starts off rocky soon becomes smooth as Lucy warms up to Ted, the local Union Officer, not to mention Blanche, her secretary.  Of course, it can't stay smooth for long, especially once her corporate office makes some abrupt changes in her plans.  But, have no worries; like every movie it steals its many scenes from, there is a happy (and very sappy) ending in store for us.

My issue is that nothing here is fresh, exciting or noteworthy.

Except Harry Connick Jr.

I credit every funny scene in this film to Connick Jr., an actor I used to kind of hate but who has lately made me take a double take (his work in 07's `Bug' was extraordinary).  He is funny, charming and totally natural here, even when everyone around him is nothing more than an over-emphasized stereotype.  He stands out, not just because everyone else is horrible, but because he is BETTER THAN THIS MOVIE.

Zellweger used to be so lovely.  Remember when she waded through `Bridget Jones' movies with spunk and sweetened naturalism?  Remember when she blew us all away with her beautifully charming breakthrough in `Jerry Maguire'?  Remember her sizzle through `Chicago'?  WHERE IS THAT GIRL!?!?  I miss her.  Her she is nothing, truly NOTHING.  Her squished face barely registers an emotion through this entire film.  In fact, the only scene she nails is the one where she plays drunk.  Siobhan Fallon is really nothing but a carbon copy of a `Fargo' character, yet without the intelligence that the Coen brothers brought to their characters.  J.K. Simmons is a great character actor, but his accent is so iffy that he really loses points here.  I will say that the weight and the beard suit him (he should think about getting fat) but aside from that he was absolutely pointless.

Why does every one of these films containing a diner waitress name her Flo?

Skip this one.  Really.  Stay away.  It's sad, because I really liked Connick Jr.'s performance and want to say ""watch this for him"" but even he is not worth suffering through the rest of this film for.  My wife even said about halfway through; ""is this torture for you too?"" and the answer was ""yes"", but I have this thing where I need to finish what I start, even if the only reason is to tear it apart the next day in a review!",1259020800,2,2895,4.524084778420039

First, the movie moves fast.  None of this jumping back 4 years, ahead 5 years, back to present stuff.  It's straight through and easy to understand.  Good acting all the way through too.

Second, the filming was amazing given they filmed in -56 degree F weather using cameras that stop working at -40 F.  In the comments section the word COLD was used more times than I could count.  There were alot of night scenes - with a few more shadows i'd say film noir.

There is a love story inside, a woman breaking the glass barrier story, and a bunch of really good fill in actors from canada that did a great job at 60 below at 3 am.

DEFINITELY watch the extras.  The deleted scenes were a blast and had me laughing pretty good but they kept it to 90 minutes with no breaks.

I think Renee Zellweger deserves an oscar nomination for her role in this film.

This is a wonderful blu ray release - definitely go for the high def disc because the quality of the footage is wonderful

3825979,2,B001WAKOW6,"Renee Zellwegger's character moves to a small town in Minnesota and finds friendship, romance, and a sense of community. Now, if only she would have found a clever script, chemistry with Harry Connick, and some intelligent life, we'd be in business. Romantic comedies follow a formula, got it, but there should still be moments where we are surprised -- there's not one moment that zigged instead of zagged. Movies about small towns paint the residents as quirky, got it -- this one paints them all as morons who couldn't make the cut in Fargo. The state of Minnesota, in and of itself, is used as a punchline, as in Why Would Anyone Want to Go There? Well, if people were as portrayed in this film, I'd be moving. I suppose that's where the movie sabotages itself -- I live in Minnesota and wondered why she wanted to live in the version portrayed in the movie. A woman is literally stumped by Renee's character responding to the question of if she'd found Jesus with, ""I didn't know he was missing."" This is supposed to become her best friend -- why?

3825980,3,B001WAKOW6,"New in Town is a fish out of water romantic comedy. Rene Zellweger plays a corporate executive who is volunteered to go to New Elm, Minnesota and take over as a plant manager. Once there, she'll be forced to organize the plant into making a new product and to lay off a bunch of workers.

She immediately meets Ray, played by Harry Connick Jr. He's the local beer drinking, pick up driving union rep, and a perfect contrast with Zellweger's city girl.

The best part of the movie is the small town charm, incuding JK Simmons as the plant foreman and Blance as the secretary at the factory who makes a great tapioca pudding. Zellweger is slowly welcomed by the town as she grows to enjoy their festivals and focus on family and even Jesus.

As for the romance and comedy, it is standard stuff. The business at the factory is forgotten through the middle of the movie. Zellweger and Connick Jr. play their parts perfectly. This is standard date fare and worth a rental only.",1250812800,,972,4.511363636363637
3825981,5,B001WAKOW6,"While so many people are looking for surprises in this film of one sort or another,
without finding it, I found it.  Somewhat in line with other comments' references to
Dicken's A Christmas Carol, and to social polarities like secular/religious, the romantic comedy and urban-rural dimensions make
for some pleasant and thought-provoking story-telling, I found, and lead up to the
most unexpected and surprising endings, possibly of all time.  Even funny progressive films like
Fun With Dick and Jane, I Heart Huckabees, and Mike Moore's The Big One simply don't get much beyond the problem of the modern corporation exploiting the locals, the little guys, and practicing
Merchant and anti-democratic aristocracy by extremist anti-union thuggery, mobster political influence, harassment, and fraud.
  This film actually breaks new ground by resolving the problem without the problematic hope of a new boss.
Remember the Who song of the same theme?  Reaching beyond the triumphant labor resolutions
of Norma Rae and North Country, this film invokes a solution characteristic of United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and Avis' past recent line of thought.  Instead, the film invokes employee-ownership is not so radical in many ways from a common sense perspective, and a historical view.  While entrepreneurial magnates have long managed to subdue America's pioneering democratic spirit with self-serving illusions of economic liberty, oh yeah, without guarantees of market diversity and democracy for the little guy.
  However, thanks to our victory in WWII, US Corporate executives have been able to stick US fingers in pies around the world, and to claim it all as ours.  As such, most of us can still not feel their pain, see the hole in this picture.  We don't live in an age where most people can see through the advertising gloss and corporate media hypno-news.  I guess the never-ending twists and turns of Dan Brown's Angels and Demons and Da Vinci Code, which also reduce
Jesus' significance to a royal genetic bloodline are fine companions to the supercharged corporate consumer culture.  See William Greider's book, The Soul of Capitalism, for a really satisyfing and groundbreaking treatment of the substance of this point.  Sen. Russell Long's ERICA ESOP legislation of the 1970's and the disastrous deregulation by corporate executives and their minions as discussed in Krugman's Conscience of a Liberal have disrupted many a real life love story, or the lack thereof.
We could even go into the deeper layers raised by Michael Clayton, The Constant Gardener, Blood Diamonds, and Erin Brockavich, but this is just a chick flick, right?
  Given the range of cinematic masterpieces over the years which have approached the topic of injustice in numerous qualitative ways, I think of My Man Godfrey, Jerry Maguire, and Chocolat.  My overall knowledge of film history is not complete, by any means.  Nevertheless, my study of biology, anthropology, and related fields, and participation in social reform has given me firm foundations that are ultimately able to counter the relentless myopic messages of billion dollar advertising schlock, internationally, but most egregiously in the US.
  Enjoy the film.  Considering the giant leap for humankind in its vision, it really is one cozy lovey-dovey comedy in my view.  As one of the film's jokes goes,  ""Have you found Jesus?""  ""I didn't know he was lost.""  Ha, ha.  Actually, Jesus healed and talked about love, justice, avoiding materialistic greed, learning, and reverence for morals and ethics.  Just where does that leave lying and cheating power addicts and unscientific ideologues all over America and the world?  How ironic that joke is.
  Like the Houston Chronicle, which published an NCBA Cooperative Business partnership op-ed following the 1999-2008 Sub-prime, Mortgage Derivatives, repealed-Glass-Steagall Act Crisis, the New York Times' NCBA advertorial, and Counterpunch's Nader on Credit Unions, this film is Gandhi for lovers and Sting and Trudie Styler for activists.

In my experience, I don't have to fast forward/tell my kids to cover their eyes/tell my kids to leave the room/just turn the thing off if a chick flick is PG.  Unfortunately, Hollywood just can't seem to master the art of combining decent and clean with high quality.  Renee Zellweger and Harry Connick were okay as the leads.  I've always liked Connick and Zellweger is growing on me.  However, the story is 100% predictable - Prada-laden, cutthroat businesswoman from Florida meets frozen backwards Minnesotan hicks.  The romance played out the way I guessed from when the two characters first met.  And the business storyline also played out as predicted.  The Scandinavian type accents on the locals, particularly Sioban were exaggerated in an effort to make them funnier but it annoyed rather than amused me.

HOWEVER you would think that there was a LEAST ONE person who worked for these people that would be able to tell them that their movie sucked.  If there is no such person then I here by applly for the position.  This movie almost sucks!

Okay let's do this the quick and painless way and list the things that are BAD:

1. There is No chemsitry between the leads.  There is nothing happening with them in any of their scenes together. The stuck zipper scene should have been charming, playfull, and cute at least, but NOTHING!  Rene has to be the one to start the kissing action and then she does it while the poor slob is telling her about his first wife dying! That is romantic?
2.  Rene Z. isn't even filmed in such away that she looks attractive.  The male lead is crubby looking and comes on as a ""pig.""  I understand that  this maybe the script's fault, but he never becomes likeable.
3. The script is predictable and the ending, well you know is coming  way too early.  The woman's dessert is thrown up to us all the way through the movie.  The ending speech is HORRIBLE! I didn't know if the guy was serious at first, I guess his lack of beard should have warned me
4. The car scene at the first of the movie between the two women fell flat and was painful to sit through.
5.  The BIGGEST sin a movie can make is being slow or dull.  This movie does both.

Why two stars?
The minor characters like the foreman are neat and interesting, especially when we go to his basement in his ex-wife's house where we me his ex  wife and what he says when she comes down stairs is great.

I've lived in Minnesota for many years, and I can honestly say that I have never, ever heard ANYONE talk like that.

I knew something was wrong with this film when I saw the font ""Papyrus"" being used for the opening credits. The script was horribly written, with awkward moments where I knew the writer thought I'd be laughing but instead, I'm looking at the clock. Renee's character is poorly developed so we don't really care if she finds love or not. Harry Connick Jr. is the only bright spot but his part is the easiest. And there is an interesting problem with the location: there are quite a few well known actors in the film that we all know... actors and actresses who we don't know their names but we know them well because they show up in every film. When you take a well known actor and then type-cast them into a severe role like a Minnesotan hick, tell them to do their best Minnesotan accent, it's hard for the audience to accept. They butcher the poor people of Minnesota. I've been to Minnesota and yes, they have accents. But not like this, people.

My wife and I made it about an hour into the film and were so bored, we decided to go to bed. We both had good books to read and with two kids and one on the way, we don't have time to waste.

3826002,2,B001WAKOW6,"There is a quiet fireside scene between stars Rene Zellweger and Harry Connick Jr. on a couch about midway through this 2009 rom-com. It lasts a couple of minutes, and that is one of the very few redeemable qualities that this otherwise flat and predictable film has to offer. It's no wonder that this movie came and went very quickly in theaters because I'm really amazed at how poorly constructed it is by Danish director Jonas Elmer and how overly reliant it is on cutesy humor and dated stereotypes. I thought Zellweger already went down the path of the smug career woman with her unctuous turn as a Doris Day wannabe in Peyton Reed's retro-kitschy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Down-with-Love/dp/B00005JLZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Down with Love</a>, but it looks like she is going down the well once again with even less fortuitous results this time. She plays Lucy Hill, a cutthroat middle management executive on the fast track in a Miami-based food processing conglomerate. Sent to the arctic-level cold of New Ulm, Minnesota, Lucy has been assigned to dismantle and downsize operations in order to produce a new snack bar line.

Tough as nails with the high heels to match, Lucy is unsurprisingly hated by most of the townsfolk with two exceptions. One is her devoted secretary, Blanche Gunderson, who has a secret tapioca recipe that figures into the by-the-numbers plot, and the other is Ted Mitchell, the local union representative who pushes Lucy off her self-anointed pedestal only to find himself falling in love with her. The film's first half is marked by all the typical fish-out-of-water clichs that co-screenwriters Kenneth Rance and C. Jay Cox could resuscitate, or at least copy from Charles Shyer's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Boom/dp/B0000542C9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby Boom</a>&nbsp;(1987), while the second half is even worse with Lucy inevitably winning the trust of the townsfolk with her fierce determination redirected in saving the plant. The means by which she finds success for the factory is almost as predictable as the makeover montage showing how she transforms Ted's adolescent daughter into a prom princess. Attempts at Capra-level corn seem not only uninspired but completely unoriginal, and the aw-shucks stereotypes of rural Minnesotans lifted from the Coen Brothers'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fargo/dp/B00009W5CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fargo</a>&nbsp;only add to the contrivances pervasive throughout the plot.

Photographed in a most unflattering manner, Zellweger has rarely been this unappealing onscreen, and it's a wonder why she would have accepted a role as soul-curdling as Lucy. Connick comes across as either belligerent or listless as Ted, and the chemistry between the actors suffers for the dichotomy. As kind-hearted Blanche, Siobhan Fallon Hogan (the birthing coach in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Mama/dp/B001BL96K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby Mama</a>) is never given a chance to elevate the character above a regional stereotype, while J.K. Simmons (the wiseacre father in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juno/dp/B000YABYLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juno</a>) manages to score a few points as the plant's curmudgeonly foreman. Interestingly, Winnipeg, Manitoba substitutes for rural Minnesota, and credit cinematographer Chris Seager for fully capturing the rigorous winter conditions. Given how dismal the movie's box office returns were, the 2009 DVD provides a surprisingly robust set of extras with a making-of featurette as well as a couple of other shorts spotlighting some of the plot devices like scrapbooking and tapioca pudding.

Studios don't make movies to loose money. Everyone knows that Scrooge will change his attitude in ""A Christmas Carol"" but does that make Charles Dicken's a bad writer? NO WAY.

So expect the expected but enjoy the funny, romantic, suspense, and characterization that is to be viewed along the way. That's what makes this movie so nice--so honestly 5-star good.

Take Lucy Hill (Renee Zellweger), the lone female of the corporate executive pool in a company needing someone to head to Minnesota, the arctic, to rid the company of losses and half a factory work force.  Predictable because you know the lady-exec will get the draft, and you know the outcome will turn out positive.  You also know that Zellweger will be sexy, completely believable, and outstanding in her portrayal of the lady-executive with an attitude needing changed--LIKE EBENEZER. She has you going ""Ah!, Yuck!, whistling, applauding, & laughing during ""New In Town.""

Expect to laugh uncontrollably when Ms. Hill flies into the much colder-than-expected Minnesota. Then, arriving as a dinner guest,  after removing her jacket [OTHERS MIGHT CONSIDER THIS SOMETHING OF A SPOILER]-----------------------she removed her light weight jacket and the housewife suggested she might need to keep wearing it because she ""looked cold.""

If you want bloody, vulgar, non-stop action, unrealistic suspense, dismemberment, and nudity, your not wanting this PG movie. It only has fun, humor, tenderness, and a positive turning about of ethics and character. GOOD STUFF in Charles Dicken's day, GOOD STUFF in Zellweger and Harry Connick, Jr. days.  Connick played Ted, the guy everyone seems upset to ""expect"" romance from at the film's beginning.  He's handsome, Zellweger's beautiful, so expect sparks.

I'm sure the director, Jonas Elmer, intended you to expect a romance. Why else would he put such an outrageous conflict of characters in such extreme settings so early in the film? The story is in the journey, not the outcome.  Well done Jonas!

Our viewing experience consisted of 4 adults: 2 male, 2 female; 2 60-somethings, 2 30-somethings, but all laughed, and enjoyed this film 100%.  Thanks for a positive helpful vote--""it's expected.""  :-}",1244678400,11,2376,5.202099737532809

3826010,2,B001WAKOW6,"2.5 stars. The title of my review pays homage to several influences that came to mind while watching ""New in Town"", all of which, I might add, were funnier than this. Multifaceted Oscar winner Renee Zellweger has finally encountered a role she can't pull off convincingly, that of a ruthlessly ambitious corporate management type tasked with turning around an underperforming factory.  'Fish out of Water' stereotypes abound as our plucky gal travels from Miami to New Ulm, MN (Winnipeg stands in for Minnesota here, and is even colder, if that is possible), to earn herself a promotion by making the factory profitable.  As her entire wardrobe consists of designer suits and shoes more fitting of a fashion editor covering the Bryant Park shows than to a hard hat zone in Minnesota in the middle of winter, her new subordinates are doubtful that this will be achieved.  As are we.  Of course, the script demands that everyone, including the hunky union boss (Harry Connick, Jr.) take an instant dislike to the stuck-up big city suit intent on screwing them out of a job, until, of course, she reveals her pluckiness and charm and they win her over with tapioca and down-home Midwestern gumption.  Renee Zellweger has proven that there is no other actress more willing to take physical pratfalls and otherwise look ridiculous as she, and she pratfalls her little heart out as she falls sideways in the snow; falls facedown in the snow; falls backwards off the porch into snow while drunk; gets her car stuck in the snow; and memorably tries to take a pee in the woods while wearing about 75 pounds of snowsuit.  She works her little heart out to bring the funny, but the script lets her down and just never gels into a cohesive whole.  Some of the supporting players are effortlessly hilarious, most notably Siobhan Fallon Hogan as Blanche Gunderson, who is certainly related to Frances McDormand's Sheriff Marge Gunderson of ""Fargo"", and J.K. Simmons (Spiderman; The Closer), nearly unrecognizable under a 10-pound beard and even heavier Minnesota accent.  The leads unfortunately can't save this from being a freeze-dried piece of Rom-Com Screenwriting 101 complete with Midwestern sterotypes.  Even if the good people of Minnesota have no other hobbies besides ice fishing, scrapbooking and eating tapioca (which I'm sure they do), this is insulting all the same.  Matthau and Lemmon did this better, and had loads more chemistry, too.  It's kinda a shame that so many cast and crew members braved frostbite for this frozen dud.  But the Academy might consider minting a new award and making Renee its shoo-in first recipient: Best Performance in Stiletto Heels on Snow Pack by a Lead Actress.  Really--she deserves some kind of recognition for that.",1243814400,12,2753,4.9847161572052405
3826011,3,B001WAKOW6,"A few things come to mind when watching this film, many of those thoughts included in the few words I've used in the title for this review: predictable - check!, cliched - check!, stereotypical - check!  If you watch this film, you'll probably think of a few more words that apply, and not just words that mean the same thing.

Predictable? Most definitely.  After being almost literally hit on the head with the mentions of a particular item you can fairly easily predict that the mentioned item will figure prominently at a key moment.

Cliched and stereotypical? It doesn't take much more than the early acts to set up that we're going to see a big city gal go to the cold and nasty, and oh, yeah, countrified and assumed to be less than sophisticated nether regions of the heartland: Minnesota, eh!

Formulaic just comes along for the ride since this is yet another romantic comedy that has to follow the requisite road map for such movies, after all, Hollywood wouldn't want to break the mold and try for originality since they can't use their predictions and modelling to tell how original material will score at the box office.

New in Town is an ok film, but I really can't go much higher than just the ok level.  Again, with the cliches, predictability, and stereotyping of people from the heartland, it's hard to not consider the film slightly flawed, despite performances that are certainly respectable.  Harry Connick, Jr., sporting a beard and look that is more like something you'd expect to see, say, David Cook (of American Idol fame) wearing (fuzzy beard/whiskers, somewhat shaggy hair style) seems ok for the role he's asked to play, and Renee Zellweger is cute and perky, though reminiscent of a past character she played: Bridget Jones.  The supporting characters are ok, though they pile on the Minnesota accent pretty heavily (which adds to the cliches and stereotyping I've complained about here).

A couple of frustrations/ notes/ comments about the Blu-ray presentation: this is the first film that I noticed (I'm sure it's happened before, but it's the first time I'm noticing it) a blatant commercial before the previews and other material that comes before the feature presentation here.  The Blu-ray includes an ad for a company that sells an overage of stock items.  Bleh.  It'd be nice to think that such ads would help keep the prices of these dics down, but that would be wishful thinking (given the retail price of this disc).  I'd have no issue having a good 10 minutes worth of commercials at the start of a disc if it meant shaving say $10 off the price of the disc, but that isn't going to happen as the studios use such things to add to the profit margin rather than reduce the prices of the products.

Similarly, this film is chock full of product placement.  Enough to prominently feature the product placement team in the credits at the end of the film, as if viewers need to be reminded that they heard mentions of those companies or saw the king of beer bottles repeatedly featured on the screen.

(Almost) Finally, to whomever designed the menu system on the Blu-ray, what were you thinking?!  While it's not horrible, it's almost barely usable because the menu doesn't indicate anywhere what menu item is selected/highlighted.  Well, actually, perhaps it does, but not in any way that is obvious to the user.  I say that because the menu for the disc slides left to right or right to left and the item that is at the left of the screen is the one that will be active.  Never mind that there are 3 other choices shown on the screen and that none of the choices are highlighted in any way, just assume that the left most item is the menu that is active.  Gee, thanks.  How about changing the color of the item, making it bolder, put a flashing widget around it or doing something else that would show what menu item is selected?!

I said *almost* finally above because I had one last thought and then the close to this review.  The one last thought was why the movie includes questions about the religious beliefs of Zellweger's character.  Questions that seem to be thrown in to enhance the stereotyping that goes on here.  That plot item was played for a little humor, but then shows up again which makes it obvious that someone wanted to make a point about such things which raises the question: why?  It wasn't needed at all, and just makes the film seem to tweak viewers that much more.

Now, finally, the important question: rent it or buy it?  Given the price tag, I'd be more inclined to say rent it.  My wife (who I watched this with) knows I'm partial to Ms. Zellweger, but even as a fans of hers I'm not really inspired to spend more than the rental fee on this one.",1243728000,,4721,4.611244019138756

Renee Zellweger portrays a Miami businesswoman who is assigned to lay off at least half the employees in a Minnesota factory. Harry Connick Jr. is the union representative who is the last line of defense in this tragic game of dollars and cents, which juxtaposes the ways and means of the big-city with small-town life.

Renee Zellweger plays headstrong businesswoman/amateur outdoors-gal Lucy Hill, and she's sent to a small town in Minnesota to make some changes at one of her employer's factories. She gets more than she bargained for when she meets Ted, played by the ruggedly handsome Harry Connick Jr., and a town full of likable folks who are so nice they even leave their keys in their cars in case a friend OR a stranger needs to make quick use of it. The Minnesotan accents of the townspeople were too cute, and I especially loved the scrapbooking characters. They made me want to be a scrapper myself. This movie was almost like one of those cheesy, cozy novels you pick up to keep you warm by the fire during winter. Harry Connick Jr. and Renee Zellweger had great chemistry. I especially loved the crow hunting excursion when Ted just about flipped Lucy upside down trying to help her get her zipper unstuck on her jumpsuit. So funny!

Yes, it's a predictable movie, but predictable can be a good thing when you just want a good laugh, a little cry and a heart-warming story with enjoyable characters.",1243382400,2,1110,4.663265306122449
3826016,4,B001WAKOW6,"Charming romantic comedy that delivers as promised. Adhering to the genre - boy and girl meet, spark, soften, screw-up and make a mess, separate and change into better people so that happily ever after seems like a sure thing -- New in Town doesn't contain many plot twists or surprises. And if you happen to be a fan of romantic comedy, you should not be disappointed by the playing out of said character development and plot.

The secondary characters in New are charming and eclipsed the leads. I adored Blanche (Siobhan Fallon) with her sweet Minnesota sensibilities, big, drippy heart and quirky out-loud thoughts. The dialog contains loads of chuckles and some of the physical humor is laugh-out-loud funny.

The film is sweet and perfect for a chick-flick night or would be a great date movie. New is reminiscient of movies like While You Were Sleeping, Two Weeks Notice and The Wedding Planner. Fans of this genre or any of these films will want to make sure to rent if not buy outright.

New in Town is family friendly save for random smatterings of moderate curse words and a scene wherein the heroine wears a tight, clingy sweater and reacts to the cold. There is a potty in the woods scene that may not be considered appropriate for those of you who screen movies very carefully for sexual/suggestive content. A mild make-out scene is hidden for the most part. I have seen/heard much worse on sitcoms.

We rented the film but it will become an addition to our library. Sometimes you just need a movie that makes you feel good about life and people. An escapist film to make you laugh and maybe sigh just a little bit. This is one of those.",1243382400,2,1651,4.624573378839591
3826017,2,B001WAKOW6,"This movie would have been a lot better without Harry Connick Jr. I am not sure when he became an actor or why for that matter, but I really don't think he matched up well with Zellweger or the others. There are a few scenes that are very funny (without Connick).  But the movie as a whole doesn't stand up to the idea of the story and it could have been a lot better. What I admire most about the film is that they shot it in Winnipeg, Canada in bitterly cold weather. And for that reason alone the film deserves four stars. But I only gave it two for the actors ability to pull their character through each scene and story development (or lack thereof).",1243209600,4,655,4.198412698412699

8347301,4,B001WAKOW6,"Hilarious and cute! Refreshingly clean for a modern rom com-other than a couple awkward jokes, there were no sexual innuendos. Humor is relatable, clever, and often physical, rather than the stupid, crude dialogue humor that most chick flicks stoop to. You might argue that the plot is a bit predictable, but the point of this movie isn't to shake up your expectations, it's just to have a good time! I really enjoyed it.",1527897600,,421,4.780821917808219

8347303,1,B001WAKOW6,Since Renee Zellweger thought she needed a makeover I need to get over her. I WILL NO LONGER WATCH ANY OF HER MOVIES.  She made the mistake of a lifetime.  Who wants to watch a film with someone you think you know but is not?  NOT ME. Worst of ALL her acting is the same.  She's still performs like Bridget Jones but will NEVER be Bridgette again OR FOR THAT MATTER RENEE ZELLWEGER.,1527811200,,382,4.191780821917808
