8371851,5,B002KBJT7W,"Although this Biography Channel biography of Jodie Foster is not up to date (the updates that are added at the end take us into approx. 2002), it is still so worth watching.  The quotes from Ms. Foster about the films that are discussed, and the insights she provides, were all new material to me.  You can tell she takes her work seriously, both as an actress and as a director.  After watching this, I was inspired to purchase several films I had not seen before, for example, ""Little Man Tate"", which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The biography program paints a satisfing portrait of a normally very private person.",1398038400,3,611,4.682242990654205
