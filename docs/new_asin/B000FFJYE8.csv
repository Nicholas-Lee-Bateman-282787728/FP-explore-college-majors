2563955,5,B000FFJYE8,"This show is GREAT! I have never seen a show/movie like this before. The writers of this show are VERY CREATIVE and have a VERY OPEN MIND! This show is very funny and suspensful. I am always left wanting more. I do wish the shows were an hour long, but it would probably take the suspense away. I applaud everyone who is involved with this show, including the actors/actresses. I like the fact that the people Nancy 'deals' with are black and a bit ghetto because they know the rules of the 'game' and help her along the way. I would not change anything about this show and reccommend it to anyone who has an open mind and is not offended by illegal distribution of an illegal drug! It is just a show and is here for our entertainment! Have an open mind, stop being prudes, and WATCH AND ENJOY! The second season airs on August 14th (which is a Monday) at 10pm ET. C-yall there!",1153440000,4,878,4.295180722891566
2563956,2,B000FFJYE8,"""Weeds"" is ridiculous. If the show aims to satirize the California gated community where it takes place as unimaginative and full of hypocritical jerks who don't know what to do with their gratuitous wealth, than how are we supposed to like Nancy Botwin or respect her decision to put her life and her family's life in danger to keep up with these particularly unlikable Joneses? It's a paradox the show can't seem to resolve: why risk so much for so little?

For those prudes offended by the pot-peddling aspect of the plot, don't be, because it is generally dealt with in a silly way and only occasionally punctuated by the inherent undercurrent of gunshots, risk or danger.  A far more inflammatory aspect of the plot is its depiction of the Black family from whom Nancy procures the potent plants.  While the writers of the show try so hard to make this family seem like ""real folks"" it instead offers caricatures with little storyline or characterization except to serve as a foil to Nancy's own unlikable family, community and circle of friends.  And let's face it: none of the characters come off particularly well here.  Nancy's sons are dull: the over-sexed teen and the brilliant, brooding pre-pubescent, while the Justin Kirk Brother-in-Law character is just around to push the proverbial envelope.  It's all been done before and elsewhere and better.  I gave it two stars because I laughed now and then and the Elizabeth Perkins character grew on me after about 4 episodes...",1153180800,14,1487,4.876984126984127
2563957,5,B000FFJYE8,"People need to just enjoy that this show is clever and not need it to be anything else.  Don't wish for it to be realistic or truthful or on the ""correct"" side of any issue.  It's not. That said, it does poke fun at the notion that everyone feels entitled to or aspires to granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances and would rather have their fingernails pulled out than give them up once attained.  It does point out that parents have dirty laundry and kids are not innocent. Avid Reader should read closely enough to see that Mary Louise Parker (not Mary Stuart Masterson) plays Nancy Botwin (not Botwit), especially if she is going to continue to publish reviews on this website daily.  Proofreading.  It's your friend.",1152662400,4,732,4.6875
2563958,4,B000FFJYE8,"Mary Louise Parker plays Nancy Botwin, a single mother whose husband recently died leaving her with no means of supporting her children.  Her sons, 10-year-old Shane and 15-year-old Silas, have no idea what avenues her mother has taken to avoid losing the lifestyle to which her family has become accustomed. This includes karate lessons, DSL, a live-in maid and a number of other things that kids take for granted. Nancy, head of the Healthy Children's Committee in her school PTA, takes the only road she sees at the time and starts selling marijuana.

This show is funny and poignant in equal measure.  It's hard to imagine that in small-town suburbia, in this case Agrestic, California, there is a soccer mom watching her kid's game and dealing pot on the side.  This is balanced nicely with the story of a woman trying to support her family and pull her life back together at the same time.  The loss of her husband is a critical plot point in both Nancy's life and the development of her sons.  It's hard not to love this show with the way it blends comedy and drama so effortlessly.

The supporting cast includes Nancy's food-obsessed best friend Celia, the gun-toting, trash-talking Black family who sells her drugs, her free-loading, unemployed brother-in-law and a number of stereotypical affluent suburbanites who just happen to smoke pot on the side. Also, look out for guest appearances from Jeffrey Dean Morgan (who played Denny on the second season of Grey's Anatomy) as Nancy's deceased husband and Allison Janney (who plays C.J. on the West Wing) as an attorney and marijuana advocate.

This show is as addictive as the product Nancy sells and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.",1152662400,4,1705,4.875432525951557
2563959,4,B000FFJYE8,"...but the DVD release knocks off a star for only being 1.33:1.  Come on, guys, this was made widescreen - so why is the DVD not widescreen as well?

Ignoring that, this is the second best thing on Showtime these days (right after Penn and Teller's BS).  Almost everything I hate about suburbia is skewered left right and center.  Make no mistake - this is not reality - this is a subdivision out of the Twilight Zone.",1152576000,6,418,4.3896103896103895
2563960,3,B000FFJYE8,"I really love this show.  Everything about it is great, however I wish episodes were an hour long rather than 30 minutes.  I give the show 5 stars, but the fact the DVDs are only in fullscreen knocks off 2 stars.  I watched it on HDTV in widescreen and it was great--to watch it fullscreen on my widescreen TV sucks.  They won't release Season 1 in widescreen, I'm sure--but I sincerely hope they do it with future seasons.",1152576000,7,423,4.384615384615385
2563961,5,B000FFJYE8,"Weeds is one of the smartest, wittiest and most intriguing television shows I have come across, and with that said, it is no wonder it could only air on a network like Showtime (the other being HBO). While most people will enjoy this show, I think only people who have ""experience"" with the show's overall theme will fully understand and appreciate the situations that the show deals with. This show is also that much more better while you watch it under the same influence that it is talking about :] But that doesn't undermine the show's clever writing and brilliant acting. I'm so glad Parker won the best actress Golden Globe nod over the overrated Desperate Housewives cast because she is not only a better actress but it also gave this show the publicity it very much deserves. It's one of the sharpest shows on TV, and there is never a dull moment. Again, if you've never experienced the lifestyle that this show portrays, you might find yourself wondering what all the buzz is about. But otherwise, I don't think anyone could refuse this show. Brilliant, and can't wait for season 2. (Great cliffhanger in season 1 by the way)

PS Did anyone know that Nancy's son is the same actor who provided the voice for Nemo in Finding Nemo? :]",1152489600,6,1241,4.615384615384615
2563962,1,B000FFJYE8,"I have to admit this show is good, but one does have to step back and say to oneself: if the main character wasn't white this show wouldn't work. She would have been hauled off to jail already.",1151884800,20,193,4.105263157894737
2563963,4,B000FFJYE8,"I have seen most of the episodes twice. Its been a long time since I spent any extended time in California. I am familiar with most of the legislative changes there, but not the social practices associated with those laws. However ""Weeds"" has for the most part renewed my fascination with this world.

I am convinced that though the Weeds scenario shows some of the very real aspects of public, social life, it also has some glaring weaknesses. This may be purely imaginitive on my part, maybe even paranoid, but it is hard to imagine how in such a generally repressive legal environment, where the federal police persist in their quest to destroy the marijuana-smoking elements in our society, these people can exist with impunity. Again, this may just be paranoid.

I know that tens of millions of Americans smoke pot every year. But it seems the Weeds cast live in a world where the oppressive bureaucracy does not exist, or exists peripherally to their reality. I know there is some paranoia in the cast's activity, but, I am having a really hard time imagining their being so untouched by the law.

On the other hand, these white middle-American citizens are not under suspicion, they are not profiled, even though they smoke the majority of pot in the nation. I am impatient to see how all this turns out in 5, 10 or 20 years, as well as the the next season of Weeds. The drug war will come to an end and I hope it will be sooner rather than later, so the characters of any real version of Weeds will not live in paranoia any more.

The show is a hoot. There are many real world situations and moral quandaries resolved like ordinary people would resolve them. It is a great show and I look forward to the next season.",1151107200,55,1724,4.516025641025641
2563964,5,B000FFJYE8,"I hadn't watched this series before. (Don't have Showtime)But I've always liked Mary-Louise Parker. I downloaded this on to my Ipod for a trip I was going on. I've watched each episode at least 3 times already. The players in this are all wonderful! The story lines are full of humor, drama and just some fun trips to the candy store. It makes you look at peoples faults in a whole new way.

I'm buying this as soon as it's available on DVD. I have a LONG wait for series 2.

The children are extremely disrespectful to their parents which makes me cringe every time a kid disrespects a parent (yelling and swearing) and the parent does nothing. There is no one on this show I can relate to or would want to be friends with. Also, it seems that the parents are all on some type of drug, whether it be weed or prescription drugs. This show is a commercial for pharmaceutical drugs. I get DVDs so I don't have to be subjected to drug commercials.

It's a heartfelt as Nancy, the widow try's her best to be a good mother, and suddenly ends up with nothing but bills and she starts selling weed to stay afloat and is in over her head to stay afloat and can't learn the ins and outs of being a drug dealer fast enough. It's such a comedic look into the the lives behind closed doors in the town of Agrestic, quite a nice place to live a life of luxury with the misery of life's little and big twists and turns no matter how good you have it, life happens and it doesn't matter who you are or what you have. Really cute show, just enough drama and laughs to relax to for me and I haven't met someone who didn't like it when I mentioned it (many many years ago when it came out.. lol). I think it's great for the first few seasons, then it began to get old and seemed too far fetched as it evolves into a quick move to Mexico, I'll leave it at that. ;)",1481241600,2,1027,4.03921568627451

2564071,4,B000FFJYE8,"The first season of Weeds is a fun twist on the typical Desperate Housewives show. The dark comedy has short, easy to follow episodes and an interesting plot. Nancy is a very complex character, but comes off as simple in this season. Her character really developed towards the end of the season, which is what makes you want to keep watching. One thing that I didn't like is that the pilot introduces several characters that we either never see again or have very little significance in the overall series. I would name more specific examples, but I wouldn't want to spoil it. The first season is also a lot more lighthearted than the later seasons. Even Celia's antics are more comedic and crazy than they are later on. It's worth watching if you want a show with a lot of drama and funny moments.",1397433600,,798,4.548611111111111

2564076,3,B000FFJYE8,"Debuting in 2005, the Showtime original production Weeds (2005-2012), explored some then new territory, as Mary-Louise Parker plays a newly widowed housewife, who turns to selling marijuana, to make ends meet.  Creating an absurd alternate reality, the program is more of an off-beat drama, centered on the use and distribution of drugs, mixed with lots of dysfunctional behavior, and in instances of ethnic stereotypes.

Its a provocative situation with lots of potential, but the first season of Weeds is a little slow and uneven.  While featuring some interesting storylines and snappy dialog, believability is low, and the plot is jumpy and very scattered, touching many areas, but not developing them very well.  Fortunately, the writing improves in season two and three, as Weeds becomes a much more entertaining and provocative watch.

Quirky cartoonish characters are a big part of Weeds, and they are generally not a very likeable group.  Some can be ridiculous, petty, or annoying, but the cast does a nice job of making them come alive.  Mary-Louise Parker () gives an engaging performance, bringing a real sense of wide-eyed delusional innocence to Nancy Price Botwin, a woman with some good intentions, who seems to alternate between desperate and bewildered, to cunningly determined, and confident.  Complex and wildly inconsistent, Nancy is an intriguing character who generates strong emotions.

The supporting cast is very solid, with Elizabeth Perkins, Kevin Nealon (SNL), Justin Kirk, Hunter Parrish, Andy Milder, and Romany Malco.  Shoshanna Stern, who was one the best things about&nbsp;, is convincing here, playing a high school senior.  Tonye Patano plays Helia James, a domineering mother, and dealer of weed, a character who seems like throwback to the kind of TV roles blacks had in the 1970s.  The introduction of Martin Donovan as DEA agent Peter Scottson, sets the stage for some major developments in second season.

Centered on the illegal activity and deception in the fictional suburb of Agrestic, California, Weeds is supposedly concerned with making a profound statement about the shocking things that can occur beneath the faade of an idealistic lifestyle.  This concept might have been edgy and impactful in the 1960s, but by 2005, life in the suburbs had surely lost any such mythic appeal.  As the launching pad for an eclectic eight year journey, Season One should not be missed by fans, however it falls short in comparison to some of the that follow.

Songs are an important element, used to reinforce the mood.  Sometimes the selections work, but other times the music is questionable, or even aggravating.  The series theme song Little Boxes is exceptionally irritating, but fortunately the music is mostly a minor annoyance.  The Bluray edition includes all ten Season One episodes on a single disc, as well as a number of commentary tracks, and other bonus features.",1390780800,,2913,5.225806451612903

Boring drama of boring people

2564089,4,B000FFJYE8,"Background: I watched this series because I heard that the producer of ""Orange is the New Black"" was also the producer, or at least one of the producers, of this series. I found this black comedy to be very entertaining. The producers explore many of the same topics, modern day tribalism - black, white, Jewish, Hispanic; what is the nature of right and wrong; and what is the line between selfish and unselfish behavior.

More background: I have never used marijuana or any other illegal drug. Except for some Tylenol III and beta blockers, I don't think I've used that many prescription drugs either. While the libertarian in me would like to see more drugs legalized, the conservative in me sees this as a change in policy that might have unintended and negative consequences. So I don't have strong feelings on the topic other then the fact that marijuana is currently illegal and therefore I have no intention of trying it anytime soon.

The Pros:

The characters that are heavy users of pot are the ones that don't seem to have much going on in their lives.  Some of the characters ""evolve"" and change for either the better or worse, but the ones that seem to come out better are the ones that either stop using pot or cut it back to level where it is purely recreational vice at an addictive destroy your live level.

While the last episode turns the series into a true comedy - in the Shakespearean sense, where all the characters have a happy ending, this black comedy shows how Nancy's fixation on selling Marijuana to supplement her income after her husband dies is largely counterproductive and leads to one crises after another.

The effect on her children is especially telling, one child becomes a psychopath (and a police officer). The other becomes a marijuana farmer. Nancy's middle class dreams of college and white collar work never materialize for her children.

In many ways, this series is anti-drug as Reefer Madness. Just in a backwards, subtle, and sarcastic way.

The Cons: While I am a softy and only want good things for real people in the real world, in a fictional tale it might have been better for Nancy to suffer more for her crimes and her selfishness.

Like many shows about drug use, this series paints what I believe to be an unrealistic picture of illicit drug use in America. Some recent polls say that approximately 100 million Americans have tried pot at least once. If true, that is still less then a third. Shows like Weeds make it seem like pot is everywhere and anyone who doesn't admit it is a hypocrite.

I found some of the, ahem, adult scenes to be a bit offensive. I know this was made for Showtime, but still... If it isn't necessary for the plot or to create an artistic point, we don't need very much information and even fewer images.

Overall, this is a fun show to watch. If you can put your judgment on hold, it is kind of fun to see what predicament Nancy will get into and how she will get out of it. However, I would not let anyone younger than 17 (or maybe even 18) watch this, the adult scenes and drug use could be misinterpreted by a younger viewer.",1377475200,3,3115,4.554561717352415

2564097,3,B000FFJYE8,"Ok so this show is a part comedy/ part drama, you have to remember that while watching it that it's completely unrealistic except for a few aspects. I have watched this series through season 6 & this is what I think, now remember this is only my opinion. You have your lead character, the mom, who after her husband dies unexpectedly needs to find a way to make money so that her family can maintain the lifestyle they live in a nice rich gated Southern California community suburb. Now in real life, there more than likely would've been somekind of savings or trustfund, she probably would've sold the house & moved the family into a cheaper neighborhood & there would also have been a $100,000plus life insurance policy to tide the family over, Soccer Mom's would've gotten off her rear & gone out & got a real job but this is Showtime TV because in real life no one really wants to work for anything, we want everything handed to us on a silver platter & if it's not then we'll take it illegally. So then, we never really see how Nancy, (The Mother), gets started with her supplier which is by the way the stereotypical black family that includes Big Momma & her daughter who is pregnant with no father around & then there's also her nephew who's a pot making genius. Nancy quickly learns the ways of the drug trade from Big Momma & quickly gets a large customer base. You also have Nancy's 2 son's, one of which is too smart for his own good, the other who's the typical california kid who gets laid whenever he wants by all his teenage airhead female classmates. There's her brother-in-law who moves in because he has no where else to go & despite the fact that he has no job & is a complete coward he's still a ladies man who can pull whatever, whenever. Other characters include her stuckup friend who's the lead of the PTA & who talks down to her chubby daughter & jewish husband & her accountant who's the corrupt leader of the city council. There's an Indian kid who turns out to be gay & your stereotypical hoochie momma ""Clinique"" whom he ends up having a baby with, you'll see how that happens. The story go's on from there through the seasons with tales of Nancy's dilemmas to make money & keep her family together. Seems every decision Nancy makes has an effect on all the characters involved & it's usually negative. As I progressed through the seasons I found myself waiting for something bad to happen to one of the main characters, i.e. getting killed but this has not happened at least not through season 6. Maybe the show should be called ""Luck & Stupidity In America"" because of the fact that Nancy is not a smart person. She constantly makes poor decisions like she has no common sense at all & has to use her family & so-called friends to bail her out of jam after jam, basically getting lucky over & over. She comes off as selfish alot of times & even though she sells weed & gets involved with a Mexican drug lord she still has an irritating sense of morality. Everytime you think she's reached the end of her rope & is about to get lead bangs on her forehead something pretty predictable happens to save her. Her dealings with the Mexicans made them look like total morons I mean there were a few times when I was like, C'mon, really but hey, it's a comedy/slash drama? It's supposed to be funny & unrealistic & that's what this is, a show  that is a fantasy look at what would happen if you made a goofy white housewife into a drug dealer. As far as hott women, IMO only the woman who plays Pilar(you'll see her when you get that far) is hott, & believe me she's smokin, MLP isn't hott to me at all with that huge forehead & giant evil dark brown eyes. So then, my reccomendation to any of you considering this series is to rent it & see what you think for yourself. Now remember it's TVMA so there's lots of cussing, nudity(mostly male unfortunately) & a bit of racism so there you were warned...",1370736000,3,3925,4.384087791495199

I feel it's a little over-rated.  It's sort of funny, but I would not invest in the purchase of the DVDs.  I find the overall tone to be a little too smug and self-congratulatory for my taste.

And I want to say that I find the theme song to be absolutely ghastly.  If I were reviewing the opening credits/theme music, I would give it zero stars.  There are a couple of reasons I say this.  One, I don't enjoy off-key singing.  Two, I don't like stupid lyrics.  The ""little boxes"" referred to are upscale homes that clearly nobody is grateful for.  I would like to know what is so awful about living in a tract home where the houses all look similar.  Apparently not individualistic enough?

I'm guessing that the song is supposed to be some sort of hipster irony.  As I said before, too smug.  I am lucky to be watching this series On Demand where I can fast-forward through the beginning.

2564123,3,B000FFJYE8,"This review rates the following (in order):
Entourage
Rome
Californication
Spartacus
Weeds
Sex and the City
The Tudors
True Blood
Big Love

My wife and I have found that we enjoy these series better than watching individual movies.  I believe that we also would rank them in the same order, so this is a male/female friendly review.  As with all MoonDonkey reviews, it goes without saying that this is gospel.

I've tried to do this without including spoilers.

#1 Entourage (5 stars)
How could anything else be #1?  Entourage follows the career of movie star Vincent Chase and his group of friends.  This is the gold standard by which all other series are measured.  Plus, Entourage has the best one-liners of any series.  Unfortunately, I cannot include them in this review due to their graphic nature.

#2 Rome (5 stars)
Rome follows the exploits of two Roman soldiers - Verenus (the smarts) and Pullo (the brute).  Very well done.  For a historical drama, the sets are very well designed and believable.  In Rome, the idea is that you see the Roman Empire through the eyes of two soldiers as they experience the ups and downs of life.  My wife and I enjoyed this one a lot.

#3 Californication (5 stars)
Frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this at first.  I pegged David Duchovny as an X-Files guy and wasn't sure what to make of him in this role.  Also, I wasn't sure what Californication was about anyway.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  In Californication, we follow the life and career of author Frank Moody - a chaotic and perhaps self-destructive individual who has a way with women.  Unfortunately for him, he is trying to balance the chaos of his life on one side with his teenage daughter and her mother (his love interest) on the other side.  The dude is a train-wreck and it makes for a great series.

#4 Spartacus (4 stars)
Spartacus is about a man who is captured and made a gladiator slave in the Roman Empire.  There is just of a bit of a drop off from the 5 star series to 4 star Spartacus.  Why?  Well, there just isn't as much of Spartacus.  Basically one season followed by a ""prequel"" season.  I believe that is because the original Spartacus actor died of cancer.  I'm not sure if there are future plans for the series or not.

Also, the effects take some getting used to.  There is definitely a CGI feel to some of the scenery.  The blood effects are similar to 300.

Regardless of those issues, Spartacus was highly enjoyable.  Even my wife, who was like ""what the heck"" after the first episode, came around and really enjoyed the series.  Maybe because they show sausage.  Some of the gladiator ""locker room"" scenes are like staring at a pack of Johnsonville brats.  There is a lot of blood and nudity in this one - as there should be given that this is a brutal depiction of life as a slave gladiator.

#5 Weeds (3 stars)
Weeds gets a golf-clap 3 star ranking.  Why?  Because the plot just doesn't make sense sometimes.  There are points in this series where you feel like it is going one way and then - boom - the plot takes a 90 degree turn towards something else.  It's not like it makes sense thought.  Rather, it feels more like a different writer came in to write a different episode or something.  It is very strange and it happens a number of times.

Weeds follows the life of a suburban mom who sells pot to make money after her husband dies.  The decision to become a dealer impacts her two sons and her husband's brother - who comes to live with her.  The series starts out with sort of a realistic ""how would this play in the suburbs"" feel, but then progresses down some more eccentric paths.

We have enjoyed the series, but this is not one that we were waiting at the mailbox for the next video to arrive.  It qualifies as a ""we will watch it when we get around to it"" series.

#6 Sex and the City (3 stars)
Sex and the City explores the lives of 4 single women and their quest for happiness and men in New York.  Why 3 stars?  This is the only series that my wife and I would disagree on the ranking.  I suspect she would give it 4 stars and I would give it two.  Frankly, it is too much of a ""chic flick"" for me... and I would guess most men feel the same way.

Wait you say - what about Entourage?  Isn't that basically the same thing with a group of guys?  In a word... no.  It isn't.  For some reason, Entourage just plays better that Sex and the City.  Also, the last couple seasons of Sex and the City really fell off a cliff.  It had the distinct feeling that they were just looking to wrap it up.

Also, speaking as a guy, this series became too ""cultish"" for me.  Do you know how many women started drinking cosmos because of this series?  For that matter, do you know how many ""Rabbits"" sold because of this series?  Sex and the City became sort of a female cultural event.  Guys - that really tells you everything you need to know, doesn't it?

#7 The Tudors (3 stars)
This is a tough one.  The Tudors is a story about the life of Henry V of England and his many wives.  It is good, but I think many people just won't get into this series.  It doesn't have the craziness of Entourage or Californication, nor the blood and guts of Rome and Spartacus.  The Tudors is more of a historical drama.  Consider The Tudors a 3 star teetering on the edge of a 2 star.  I prefer Weeds to The Tudors.  However, I think my wife would maybe rank this a bit higher.

If you choose to watch this series, I strongly recommend committing to watching the first 3-4 episodes at least.  If you just watch one or two, you probably won't stick with it.

I tell you what though - one of the most interesting things about The Tudors is all of the torture.  Watching The Tudors makes any modern ""torture"" techniques look laughable.  Water-boarding?  Bah, that's for sissies!  Give me the rack!

#8 True Blood (2 stars)
True Blood is about life in a small town after vampires have come out of the closet and try to live normal lives with humans... or at least that is what it starts out to be.

Look - I'd love to rate True Blood higher, but the series just gets weirder and weirder as it goes on.  It is like the writers got bored with the standard vampire-human conflict thing so they had to take it in several other directions... and I do mean several.  Suddenly we have werewolves, witches, shape-shifters, fairies, etc, etc.  It gets to the point where you are asking yourself, really?  Really?
I'd give the first season alone 4 stars, but it drops of to 3 stars and then to 2 stars after that.

#9 Big Love (1 star)
Big Love is about a mormon family practicing polygamy.  The story follows the life of one man and his many wives.  My wife liked this a bit more than I did, but it just didn't do it for me.  There really wasn't anything about the show that I found interesting.  I think my wife enjoyed some of the relationship drama, but she stopped watching the series and hasn't expressed an interest in continuing it.  This one was a burn-out.  I think it is because Big Love is maybe too serious - if it had a Californication element to it, I bet it would have been pretty entertaining.

So there you have it my friends.  I may continue to update this list as we watch more series.  The nutshell is that HBO appears to be focusing on more high-end ""production"" type series and Showtime is focusing on lower cost dramas.",1322438400,,7366,4.346323529411765
2564124,5,B000FFJYE8,"I have seen every episode of Weeds. Season 7 just ended and there is a reason why it reached season 7 and going on season 8. It's creative, funny, and addicting. I just bought season's 1-3 on blu-ray so I can re-watch them and also own them. Going back and watching season 1 was just as good as when I watched it the first time. The characters are one of a kind, they make the show period. On top of that, how the show revolves around selling weed is just interesting and makes it fun. I recommend this show to people who watch Showtime shows, dark comedy, and for people who just want to enjoy a really creative show without taking things too seriously. Enjoy",1318550400,,660,4.288

2564128,4,B000FFJYE8,"Because I'm definitely a ""square"" since I've never used drugs and I'm not likely to, and I don't support legalization or decriminalization of marijuana.  But I've found ""Weeds"" to be pretty interesting, frequently amusing, and sometimes rather bittersweet.  I think a lot of that has to do with Mary-Louise Parker as Nancy.  I could readily see myself following a woman as beguiling as that into a criminal conspiracy.  Another thing that I like is that the show doesn't sermonize about the need to legalize or decriminalize dope.  It just sort of lets the viewers decide on that point.

A few things in the show don't exactly ring true...like the DEA agent who becomes enamored of Nancy to the point of marrying her so he can't be forced to testify against her.  I'm pretty certain something like that would show up on his periodic reinvestigations for his security clearance (and maybe his polygraphs as well).  Also, while I give kudos to the show for casting an actress who is actually deaf to play the role of the girlfriend of Nancy's son Silas, it's a bit ridiculous to have a 26 year old playing someone who is 17 tops (would have been smarter to find someone about 20 or so and looked younger).

Also, occasionally, the show gets a bit disgusting, most notably with plot threads around Nancy's wayward brother-in-law Andy...who I think in real life would be a sociopath given his behavior.

But for the most part, ""Weeds"" is fun and I think if you liked ""the Sopranos"" and could come to care a bit about people who were far more violent and criminal in nature on that show than any of the ""Weeds"" cast in seasons one and two, I think you should give it a try, just one ""puff"".",1306713600,,1685,4.586666666666667

2564134,5,B000FFJYE8,"While I'm no 'stick-in-the-mud', I'm not someone who's generally interested in drug-themed movies & shows. Never done pot & don't plan to... So due to this, I put off watching Weeds for a long time, despite many people telling me I should give it a shot. One day recently, I signed up for Showtime (for Dexter!) and saw they had the ENTIRE series available on-demand. I figured ""hey, it's free, lets give it a shot"". Watched the 1st episode & I was hooked. It's sassy & clever and despite what some people say, I *DO* actually think the characters are likeable. Granted, some can be annoying, but I think it makes them (overall) real. That's not to say the situations she gets herself in are something most people could relate to, but she's one wily woman and I've found you just can't help but like her. The only one I don't really like very much is Kevin Nealon's character. I understand his role, but I could do w/o so much of him in the series.

So to sum it up, if you've considered giving this show a try but had some hesitations due to the subject matter, put those reservations aside & give it a shot. While it might not be for everyone, you could find yourself pleasantly surprised (like I did!) at how much fun you'll have watching. :)",1291680000,3,1245,4.413043478260869

It's like some greasy fast food fest that's half-palatable until you're finished and your stomach hurts and you realize the garbage you've just eaten. It's half watchable but still crap.  If you want a show in a vaguely similar vein but as riveting as Sopranos or Dexter, try Breaking Bad.  And if you're coming to this AFTER Breaking Bad or The Wire, you are in for some serious deflation.  Showtime, I am not impressed.  It's not the dope dealing that bugs in this show - that actually could have been interesting if the players had been given the depth of a puddle - it's the suburban triteness of every single character and everything that seems to happen to them - whitebread Hollywood America - so gauche.

The story revolved around a dysfunctional fictional community in California and a single mother (played by Mary-Louise Parker) who sells weed to make ends meet. It's tag-line reads ""A comedy series about dealing in the suburbs. The actors are talented, comical and compelling. Weeds writers allow unconventional and uncomfortable situations to pervade the plot-line, pulling you in deeper with each successional episode. Thus far, I've only bought seasons one and two, but I know some of what happens in season three and I can't wait. Watch it and you'll know what I mean. Season one is the place to start and since it's some six years old now, it is also affordable. Weeds is a rollercoaster ride you won't want to get off. It just gets better and better. It's a great watch for both men and women and is a guilty pleasure you won't get busted for. I recommend it.",1266796800,,932,4.689024390243903
2564146,5,B000FFJYE8,"I had never watched Weeds on Showtime, but heard good things from friends and co-workers. But, once you fall behind a continuing series like Weeds, it is difficult to tune in and catch up, so I decided not to. Now, years after its debut, I decided to buy the first season of the show on Blu-ray and check it out. If you're like me, and thinking about starting the series at the beginning - go for it. I am hooked!

I knew a little bit about the premise of the show - a recently widowed suburban housewife with kids who is selling pot to make ends meet. The first episode seems like it should be the second episode when you start watching it. There is no ""here's what happed to the family"" story, no ""maybe I can sell pot to the neighborhood"" moment, etc. It just jumps right in. This feels strange at first, but once you are a couple episodes in, you gain enough back story to fill in any blanks and it works fine.

The family is about as disfunctional as they come, barely held together by mom (Mary Louise-Parker) who is trying to pay bills with drug money while teaching her kids proper values and also deal with the loss of her husband. The neighbors and friends are equally interesting (particularly the character played by Elizabeth Perkins). I find the show very compelling and addictive. If you buy the full season disc, be prepared to spend a weekend watching it, because you won't be able to turn it off knowing the next episode is just a remote-click away.

Great series and highly (no pun intended) recommended.",1266278400,,1523,4.451612903225806
2564147,5,B000FFJYE8,"If you are a fan of marijuana (and who isn't?) and dark comedy, this is the show you've been waiting for. Arguably one of the wittiest, immoral, well-written shows on TV, Weeds captures the essence of Suburbia in a way that Desperate Housewives never can. Part of that comes from the fact that it is on Showtime and can therefore be a bit more dark in its themes and subject matter. The other part is the writing, which satirizes perfectly the inane perfectionism that drives most rich white people. The credit sequence alone does this better than any other show I've ever seen. On top of that, you've got a stellar cast of multi-layered characters getting involved in all kinds of debauchery that constantly escalates and doesn't feel ""written"" like most shows that seem to build arbitrarily based on the weekly whims of the writer's. Weeds feels like one big, long story segmented for TV.
 Fresh, original, occasionally quite seedy, Weeds is everything that a TV show should be. Sure there are some plot-lines that are a bit familiar, but nothing too bad. Overall, the feel of the show is perfect for anyone who rolls their eyes at Desperate Housewives or other shows claiming to thoroughly lampoon modern Americana. Weeds fulfills this role with gusto and grace, keeping viewers high on its deranged spirit all the way through. It should be noted however as potent and funny as Weeds is, it is SEVERELY ADDICTING, mainly due to the fact that those shrewd writers I mentioned are highly, highly adept as providing cliff hanger endings that often seem to emerge out of nowhere but always, always, always leave you wanting more.

I was able to get seasons 1-3 on sale at Amazon for same price as the regular DVD so, at least I didn't over-pay.  But, if I had shelled out the full-price, I would be upset about it.

2564154,4,B000FFJYE8,"""Saving Grace"" was a funny little British comedy about a frumpy, middle-aged widow who is shocked to realize that her deceased husband had left her with a pile of debts rather than a bucolic English mansion.  Fueled by lots of funny ""look-at-the-innocent-old-ladies-with-the-ganja"" jokes and a young, manic Colin Ferguson, ""Saving Grace"" worked and worked well.

""Weeds"" is the American retelling of this charming tale.  While ""SG"" poked a lot of fun at the stiff English upper lip sent all aquiver after a few luxurious drags, ""Weeds"" sets its gunsights squarely on American Suburbia.  Set in the androgynous, heartless Eden that is Agrestic, California, ""Weeds"" does nothing if it does not shred the ideal picture of life in America for those who are not Wealthy, but who are in fact very well off.

Our heroine, Nancy (Mary-Louise Parker), is a struggling widow following the shocking death of her husband - a sudden heart-attack for a guy who appears to have been healthy as a horse (we see him in some home movies).  She's got a huge house in Agrestic for her two boys, a nanny, and no job.  So naturally she turns to dealing pot, as everyone in Agrestic who appears to be virtuous and true (PTA members, lawyers, accountants) is actually nothing but a ravenous pot-head.  Indeed, perhaps the only adults we don't see getting baked are Nancy's dealers, a shockingly-black family in this lily-white enclave.  Nancy is a natural dealer, both charming and desperate enough to do what's necessary.  She's also got an entrepreneurial gift, and soon she's the Godmother of the local pot infrastructure.

While Nancy is our focus, there are plenty of minor characters who flesh out this story.  There are too many to name, but Elizabeth Perkins' Celia - PTA witch, suffering wife, and now coping with breast cancer - almost steals the show.  But it's unfair to single her out too much - this isn't a true ensemble cast a la ""The Wire,"" but there are lots of terrific ""minor"" characters here.

More savage than ""dirty,"" there's more than a fair amount of ""adult subject matter"" that will make you think twice about allowing your kids to watch ""Weeds.""  It's too bad, because this is one of the best-written shows on TV today.",1258070400,2,2222,4.841269841269841
2564155,3,B000FFJYE8,"It took me awhile to try this series, having read many reviews, I thought it had a 50-50 chance of working for me. I finally found it fairly cheap somewhere at the end of the summer when not much was on TV. I am not sure why this DVD is classified as a comedy, I didn't find myself laughing much. I guess the hypocrasy was supposed to provide the humor, but I find too much of it in every day life anymore, I just couldn't find it entertaining. Sad, but not entertaining. There are bright points in the writing, the whole story line on how the family deals with the loss of their husband/father did draw me in, but that is more drama than comedy. In the end, the drug dealing and sex story lines which take up most of the air time are just distracting to me. If the writers focused more on the emotions of the various characters dealing with their reality, it would probably make a pretty good drama series.

You won't find too many movies or TV shows about a drug dealing housewife and the show does have a few good moments, so I don't want to totally discourage others from trying it. On the other hand, the writers seem to rely heavily on the typical hollywood point of view of right and wrong, so this may be offensive to some. They also seem to rely heavily on sex scenes to impress the audience (sex sells, right?) For me, I think I will pass on the rest of the series unless I can find it super cheap somewhere.",1256515200,5,1418,4.213235294117647

I giggled when little Johnny fell and broke his arm while he was watching daddy on the camcorder, does that count?  ""Oh golly gee, life is so horrible in suburbia. Why, I hate it so much, I'm going to start selling dope so that I can stay here.  Oh the horror. I gots ta head ova to mah stereotypical black drug supplyahs dawwwwg!"" (the banter between her and the dealer family full on shreds the limits of credulity). I mean, geez, if she were doing it to survive it would be one thing, but doing it to maintain a lifestyle?  I guess maybe some people could find that to be a sympathetic thing to identify with but sheesh.  I could really give a crap less about the dope use.  There are no characters that I like in this show.  I detest them, they treat their children like garbage.  The writing is bad.  When I read Wuthering Heights, I hated every character in that as well, but it was so well written, I zipped right through it.  This.. has nothing.  No moral struggle, at all.  Just cynical snickers.  The only way this thing would be interesting is if they had an episode that released crazed velociraptors into the area to gnaw on these boring freaks.

After watching all three seasons of Dexter I had hopes that this would be somewhat of the same quality.  Couldn't be more wrong.  And Breaking Bad is just way, way better.  Avoid this at all costs unless watching jaded, self-hating Red Diaper Doper Babies struggle under the weight of their own excrement is your bag.

2564182,3,B000FFJYE8,"Like Little Children, American Beauty, and Edward Scissorhands, Weeds portrays a planned community as a forgotten circle of Dante's Inferno.  Suburban life really isn't the gated paradise the brochures from the housing committee promise; rather, it's a cesspool of petty people with too much money and nothing to do with their lives.  We've seen these kinds of shows and movies before.  What's unique about Weeds is that there really aren't any sympathetic characters.  Even the children in the show come off as selfish demons (who seem far too wise and ironic for their respective ages).  The cast is superb.  The things they do and say make you alternately cringe, laugh, and open your mouth wide to say, ""He did not just do that!""  And it's worth mentioning that the end credits to each episode generally feature a very funny and sometimes dirty folk or pop song that serves as an audio metaphor for the entire episode.  I enjoy the show's attempt to tell a quirky and increasingly unrealistic tale that must be a tremendous challenge for the writers.

On the other hand, the show doesn't evolve much further than a writer's delight: So much of the dialogue is simply a stream of creative, new curse words and phrases.  These start off as shocking and funny, but the veneer wears thin when you realize that it's just a device to divide your attention from the fact that very little is happening in the show, because all of the characters are made of the same selfish mold.  It reminds me of how Family Guy uses the same device in nearly episode: Something happens and Peter will be reminded of the time when he [fill in the blank], and the show proceeds to randomize the plot with a barely relevant flashback.  Again, funny for a while, but it gets old fast.

I should say that I'm not at all put off by Weed's liberal politics, with which I tend to sympathize, and which is probably the most consistent (biased?) part of the show.  Yet something essential is missing from the discussions on race, immigration, drug trafficking, teen pregnancy, single motherhood, suburban life, religion, draft dodging, and so on.  In the end, I have a sinking feeling that the show itself is selfish.  The show, like the characters in it, wants to gate itself off from the views of dissenters like conservatives and the religious.  But that's the way extremism works: Just as fundamentalism breeds no irony and imposes a black/white morality onto humanity, material secularism obfuscates personal responsibility and self-discipline.  In short, the show preaches to the choir who thinks the world would be better if everyone was a little higher, and the show only rarely entertains the possibility that maybe that's not really true either.",1233532800,16,2726,4.85097192224622

2564193,4,B000FFJYE8,"I don't particularly like ""drug humor,"" so I passed on ""Weeds"" when it first went on the air.  However, the reviews for the show have been consistently very good, so I decided to finally watch a few episodes.  I liked them.  ""Weeds"" is about Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), a mother who lives in an expensive planned community (fictional Agrestic, California) and was left penniless when her husband unexpectedly dropped dead jogging.  She turns to dealing pot to keep up her tony life-style, and it turns out that she's pretty good at it.  The first few episodes show her adjusting to the absurdity or her new career and balancing her drug dealing with raising her two sons, teenaged Silas and the pre-pubescent Shane, who are adjusting to their father's death.

The show relies on this clever conceit of the drug-dealing mom for much of its humor, but at its heart ""Weeds"" is a devious satire of suburbia.  Nancy may seem immoral selling drugs in order to make her Range Rover payments and to buy the steady stream of iced coffees she totes everywhere; however, she is far from being the most deviant character.  PTA uber-mom Celia (Elizabeth Perkins), for example, has a cheating husband, an overweight daughter whom she tries to browbeat daily to watch her calories, and a teenaged daughter whom she sends to boarding school after she sleeps with Silas.

The show is well-written and offers plenty of laughs, and the acting is terrific.  I'm not usually a fan of Mary-Louise Parker, as she too often seems depressed and mopey in most roles.  However, she's very good in this career-defining role - even sexy at times.  She's received two Emmy nominations for Best Actress in a Comedy and a win in that category at the Golden Globes.  The crowded supporting cast is joined by Heylia (Tonye Patano), Nancy's sassy supplier, along with her family members, Vaneeta and Conrad.  Finally, Kevin Nealon plays Doug, the marijuana-crazy CPA who helps Nancy run her business and also serves on the Agrestic City Council.  Many of the biggest laughs are supplied by Heylia, although people who appreciate pot humor will probably also like Doug.

During the first season, ""Weeds"" does a great job of examining the hypocrisy of suburbia.  Nancy's drug dealing is balanced nicely with plots involving Shane's school problems, Celia's family and their issues, and so forth.  Unfortunately, mid-way through the season, Nancy's brother-in-law, Andy (Justin Kirk) arrives.  Andy is a juvenile, pot-smoking, responsibility-shirking idiot, and he is on-screen far too often in the second half of the season (and beyond).  In particular, as he and Doug become friends, the plots too often involve them being stoned and irresponsible - the very reasons I avoided ""Weeds"" initially.  However, overall, the show still remains strong despite these unlikeable characters.",1225584000,6,2852,5.06423982869379

2564195,1,B000FFJYE8,"I generally hate television. In fact haven't had any TV reception where I live for the last 15 years. A friend suggested The Sopranos which I could watch on DVD. What a great experience that was. I'm serious, it has qualities of being the Shakespeare of our time. So I came across WEEDS in hopes of more great, daring programing. After reading several reviews I ran right out to buy Season One. Well, I tapped a few buttons and ordered it. What a fine concept! When you measure up the harm alcohol does to our society, murder, domestic violence, car crashes...I thought: SHOWTIME good for you!! A single mother surviving off of selling grass. And please, let's not lump all the drugs together, grass is fine and probably helps lots of people in our pressure cooker age. But this show...I found the lead actress SO unlikable! She reminded me of my worst girlfriends. So negative. Those ugly stares and for some reason they decided they needed to move her from one crisis to another. Sure, it's TV, I understand. Sopranos moved fast and had its share. But PLEASE, so many of the problems are so stupid! So improbable. So shallow. Maybe it is just me. Maybe I read too much and books have ruined it for me. Maybe my loathing for cheap TV sit-coms is too great. I thought the writing was plain awful! This writing is not from a person or people who have been out in life. These are from people that have spent 200,000 cooking their brains with other TV shows and trying to build concepts on balloney. The stereotype black family with the drive-by shooting, these people crazy-glued to that kitchen table. And what about the sex on the hood of the other dealer's car?  The younger son is great and has a future. I think if you want something with depth, with intelligence, with some vision as in Fellini films (the early ones) and great stories of the human condition with humor mixed with angst, and tragedy blended with lust..forget it! This series is about as shallow as they come. Why did I watch it? I paid for it and I just kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. I'd say that three out of five people would feel about this show as I do. Two out of those five would never buy it. And nine out of ten of those like me that bought and watched and hated it would never go to the trouble to write a review. Bare with me, I'm just trying to understand how a show that is so bad could have so many good reviews and sucker people like me into buying it. All cast members required to log-on and sing praises?

2564196,4,B000FFJYE8,"""Weeds"" is a pretty seamless show.  It juggles comedy, satire, and drama so successfully that you can never really predict which scene will bring what.  It's a tightly written series with a great cast that all comes together in one of the most utterly addictive television shows that is currently on air.

I love that the show doesn't condone or condemn marijuana.  I love that this isn't a show you have to be high for, but it's also so intelligently and thoughtfully written that it appeals to people who just may be high when watching.  I love that it isn't afraid to show the petty and ugly sides of the characters we're supposed to sympathize with.  And while I usually love long, twenty-five episode seasons, I love that this season is made up of ten half-hour episodes that are more like slices-of-life than any noticeable story arc or anthology.  I love that you can pretty much sit down on a lazy afternoon and watch the entire season and still have the night to yourself.

The first season of ""Weeds"" is an air-tight, well done show that will appeal to the stoner crowd, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desperate-Housewives/dp/B00079FUI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desperate Housewives</a>&nbsp;crowd, and virtually anyone in between.  It's easily one of the finest shows on the air right now, and I can't wait to see what directions this series takes.

While at times, at least in season 1, the writing/story may be lacking, you can't help but laugh at Doug (Kevin Nealon), scoff at Andy and shake your head at Nancy and Celia!  What's more, is that even the cast that has a slightly more supporting role, is truly talented and gives the show it's life.

2564203,4,B000FFJYE8,"My initial reaction to Weeds was that it stunk. Quite frankly, the pilot episode isn't good. The characters spoke unnaturally, the scenes dragged on,  and it was utterly charmless. Overall, it felt like everyone was trying too hard to be super edgy and shocking. On the advice of a friend, though, I gave the show another chance, and I had to admit that the second episode had me a little curious to see what would happen next. By the third episode, I was hooked.

It's difficult to characterize this show, in that its episodes are a half-hour each, but there's as much, if not more, drama than ""comedy"" here - though in the post-Sopranos world, the distinction has become blurred, which is great for a show like this. There are definitely some big laughs along the way, but once the show settles in and finds its rhythm, Weeds  starts building real conflicts and character-driven stories, whether they have comedic aspects or not. And the main story arcs have some really strong momentum: it's not often that the final scene of a ""sitcom"" gets you rushing out to see the next season.

To me, Weeds is at its best when Mary Louise-Parker is taught the various ways in which her industry works: the business model, the economics, the dangers, etc. It's important that a show based mainly on one central character has an actress that can pull off the ranges of emotion required, and I think Parker does this well.

Like all Showtime shows that I've seen (except It's Garry Shandling's Show - thank goodness), Weeds indulges in too much graphic sex, though it's not on the level of something like The Tudors. Sometimes it works for the plot; sometimes it's just gratuitous.

Reflecting back, my only wish for this season was that it had had the pilot it deserved, but of course it's better to start poorly and then get better than to start off well and get worse. So kudos to Weeds for a strong first season. I think anyone who's enjoyed other uncompromising cable-based shows will find a lot to enjoy here.",1213056000,6,2004,4.646892655367232

2564205,5,B000FFJYE8,"On the surface, Weeds is a satire on suburban life (this is evident from the opening credits, which show identical people leaving their identical houses in identical SUVs). On this level, the show works pretty well most of the time, but really, how hard is it to satirize suburbia? Tim Burton played most of the same cards as Weeds way back in Edward Scissorhands. There are some new complications here, and even if it is familiar territory, it's still pretty fun.

But what makes Weeds truly great TV is its cast of characters, who all go beyond the easy suburbanite stereotypes and become people you truly care about (with the exception of the oldest son, Silas, who is pretty one-note). The writing is sharp and funny, and the acting is superb across the board.

However, it should be said that if you are steadfastly opposed to drug use, you probably will not like this show. It's pretty blas about marijuana use, and the only real dangers the show associates with dealing pot are getting caught with it and being targeted by other dealers. That being said, the show is definitely not simpleminded pothead humor (sorry ""Half Baked"" fans). I only mention this because I know people who are not willing to give the show a chance because of their own anti-drug position.

There I found scratches unlike any I had ever seen before, you could feel them running your fingers on them. they were really bad and deep. My guess is this is a factory flaw, because this disc came super sealed (sideways and up and down) and the disc was in it's place safe and secure. Little good that did since apparently it was damaged (defective) from the start.

I just hope no one else had the same experience I did. Especially since I live in Kuwait and it's cheaper for me to buy another one than ship it back.",1212278400,,920,4.221590909090909
2564208,5,B000FFJYE8,"Ok, so I'm almost FOUR YEARS LATE with this - but I've only recently discovered the show ""Weeds"" and am now hopelessly addicted. The ensemble cast is terrific, the writing is clever, even the music selection for the shows stands out.

Weeds is a 30 minute sitcom that airs only on Showtime (which is partially why I'd never seen it - I don't watch Showtime). But the good news for you Netflix subscribers out there is that seasons 1 & 2 are available to watch instantly on your PC - this is a very good thing - as I watched the entire first season in two days and don't know what I'll do when I get to the end of season two (oh, yes I do - I'll go out and buy Season three).

The story centers around the life of Nancy Botwin (played by Mary-Louise Parker), who loses her young husband to a heart attack, and has to go from a stay at home soccer mom to the person responsible for paying the bills. Since she has no prior career path, she takes up selling pot to the people she knows in her L.A. suburb, Agrestic. Among her customers are the head of the city council - and her financial adviser, and a lawyer whose head is shaved bald while he's asleep after his wife sees a video of him having sex with the tennis pro.

Her connection for pot is the African American family of Heylia James (Tonye Patano), and some of the funniest scenes come when she is on the camera. The cast also includes Elizabeth Perkins, and Kevin Nealon - both brilliant in their roles.

This is just one of the funniest, most clever shows I've seen in years, and I can't recommend it highly (no pun intended) enough. As an added bonus, you can go here and stream all of the music used in the show - it makes for a great listen!",1211932800,5,1703,4.182926829268292

because that's pretty much all this series is about. A mom confronts her teen aged son about him having sex in her house, and he's basically like ""sure mom, whatever"". The mom is confronted by her friends about being a drug dealer and she's like ""whatever, i do what I want"". Her friend finds out that her husband is cheating on her, the husband finds out the wife is cheating on him, both react with a hearty ""meh""

No one on this show feels anything, the entire thing is a cast of cardboard cut out characters behaving in a way that would have been shocking 25 years ago but isn't now, and the show's only redeeming value then would have been the constant shocks

In the modern day, there is nothing to recommend this failed attempt at alt-suburbia, unless you really enjoy the hell out of watching mindless situations that you've seen a million times before. Black guy is a thug and talks tough on the street, but is scared of his loud, slang-talking mom who he still lives with. A bunch of soccer moms who appear to have the perfect lives on the outside really are bubbling cauldrons of sexual energy on the inside. Some of them even cheat on their husbands and don't feel bad about it! Kids get mad and curse their parents, the parents are baffled

Etc etc, every episode. Any tired cliche you can think of eventually makes its way into season 1, and from what i've seen by catching the occasional episode, the show hasn't gotten any better since then.

Weeds is about Nancy Botwin a working mum and housewife who gets into the darkest situations when her husband unexpectedly drops dead and she is left to raise two kids, a brother-in-law and rustic area's secret addiction to home-grown weed. Using this; as a way of dealing with her emotional collapse, in return for providing for the family by dealing marijuana to neighbours and spacey school-kids. Nancy is played with perfect pokerfaced-untelling-drug-seller mum by Mary-Louise Parker, ex-West Wing star who talks on a less political and more social tasks of day to day life. She is groomed for any social eventuality. Alongside the mum of two is youngest Shane (Alexander Gould) who played the voice of Nemo in `Finding Nemo' who is less stutter and more into the wild flights of fancy. Older bro Silas (Hunter Parrish) who is eager to get his school life on the OC-type list by doing anything or anyone possible.

Yes, selling drugs makes good TV? Weeds outshines the morally ambiguous judgement on drugs.  Some of the people who do drugs are good, some are bad. But it's the person we judge, not the substance.
While it seems a bit Desperate Housewives, it's got a lot more going for it. With bitchy neighbour Elizabeth Perkins who makes the typical rich mum attitude take a leap forward.

2564215,3,B000FFJYE8,"Weeds has been vaguely disappointing to me for its two season run.  Production-wise, the show ranks up there with the good HBO shows--there is good acting, excellent cast (mostly), and overall movie-quality production.  Where the show disappoints, though, is in its overall plot and storylines; that is, the entire concept.  Ultimately, the problem with Weeds lies in its main character, played by Mary-Louis Parker.  Her problem--and I don't know if this is mostly the fault of the actress or the character--is that she is just too ditzy and stupid to be very compelling.  Her life decisions are completely immature and done at the level of a teenage intellect.  I just can't identify with her at all, and I don't really like her.  I contrast this with some other shows with lead characters who also engage in controversial behavior; for example, Tony Soprano, Al Swearengin, Bill Henriksen, and Carrie Bradshaw from the Sopranos, Deadwood, Big Love, and Sex and the City respectively.  All of these characters, like Parker's, were engaging in much behavior that was either unethical or downright sadistic and criminal, but there was something compelling about their roles and how they lived in their life circumstances.  Each of them, the mobster, the saloon owner, and the polygamist, were dealing with situations in which they had been placed, that had their own codes, and there was something compelling and likable about each of them.  They had contrasts which drew me in as a viewer.  Parker's character is not near the level of these others.  There is really nothing compelling or likable about her character.  I think this indicates there is just something fundamentally wrong with the basic premise of this show, that prevents it from being at the level of the other mentioned shows.

Seeing the 1st season again has confirmed my opinion that that 1st season is still the best season by far. Here we find Nancy Botwin, recently widowed, navigating the still-new world of illegal drug dealing, and trying to keep it a secret from her children and the Agrestic moral majority.

Remember when you were a kid, and you picked up a big rock or log in your backyard and discovered the creepy crawly world hiding underneath? That's what ""Weeds"" does ... uncover what lies beneath the pretty surface of suburban life. What we discover is both funny and sad; failed marriages, cynical children, crooked local politics, and sexual peccadilloes. In the 1st season, the focus was really on the characters, all of whom, for all their quirks, are fairly easy to relate to. Even when tragedies strike, such as Celia's cancer, the series maintains a low-key charm to it.

By season three, the lives of Nancy Botwin and Company have spiraled so out of control and reached such a feverish level of peril and dysfunction that the show has lost much of that low-key charm. Here's hoping that season 4 is able to regain some of it.",1200441600,,1277,4.621145374449339

You could substitute the pot in this series with purebred dogs, racing cars, esoteric coffee, whatever. Weed is not central to the storytelling. It's all about the endearing collection of screw-ups!

OK, that's preposterous. It's also about the pot. The high tech grower's conference with the flowery interchangeable buzz marketing terms was hilarious. Riffing here: ""It's a teutonic buzz, like a horde of barbarians flooding your mind to a techno soundtrack. Well-organized, disciplined muchies, with a clean finish."" (If I were clever that would also refer to this series, but it doesn't - was just silliness.)

** Great soundtrack! **

Anyone in California has seen a few of the planned purgatories that Agrestic so perfectly portrays. You buy into the dream thinking that comfort equals happiness, and the emptiness starts to gnaw at you. Enter our heroine.

You know, I never understood Kevin Nealon while he was on Saturday Night live, but here, he's outrageously entertaining playing the character of shallow Councilman Doug. I shouldn't single him out. Elizabeth Perkins is wonderful. Uncle Andy's lessons about life (all learned the hard way, apparently). Actually, practically everyone is great, which is weird.

Initially when I watched Mary-Louise Parker, I wondered who she kept reminding me of... and then it hit me: she was precisely mimicking Bradley Whitford, with whom she co-starred in West Wing, according to IMDB. Or is Bradley copying her? Will have to see them pre-2000. It's just like Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum. (Update: in Season 3, she loses the Bradley speak. Good move, I think.)

The theme song sounds like someone had been reading an old John D. MacDonald ""Travis McGee"" novel when they wrote it. I don't remember which one off hand, but I do remember the part about ticky-tacky houses all in a row from one of the novels.

As for the subject matter, I'm not familiar with it but the economics of the situation are familiar. A woman starts a small, illegal business and finds herself with money problems. Her suppliers provide cheap merchandise, her cash flow can't be recorded, and she finds herself in competition with government sanctioned competitors. She slowly learns the ins and outs of how her business should operate.

Mary-Louise Parker does a fine job as the woman with a new ""business."" However, Elizabeth Perkins does an outstanding job as her somewhat questionable best friend. How these two can even stand each other is something that always keeps me watching.

Four stars out of five. It should have been five, but the DVD production leaves a lot to be desired. Why wasn't this in widescreen instead of full screen? They've been producing TV shows in widescreen since the late 1990's. Why are only commentaries that don't tell you a whole lot the only features on the first DVD? What's with all the promos that are called features on the second DVD? One can only hope that the second season will correct some of the DVD problems.",1194566400,2,1474,4.7015503875969

2564239,5,B000FFJYE8,"An absolute must-buy for fans of season-length television shows on DVD.  The first season of ""Weeds"" is funny, poignant, sexy, and intelligent, making each 27-minute or so episode fly by.  Like ""The Sopranos"", another show about criminals attempting to shoehorn their illegal activities into otherwise normal lifestyles, ""Weeds"" doesn't take the obvious approach and make its storylines about learning that crime doesn't pay; rather, it takes the more realistic (some would say cynical) path, essentially saying that people are going to do what they're going to do, stopping or adapting an activity only when their livelihood or freedom is threatened.

Having said said, however, Mary-Louise Parker's drug-dealing soccer mom character, Nancy (though it's judo matches rather than soccer matches that she attends), is still generally sympathetic, seeming to have gotten into the marijuana business only to support her family after her husband's death.  Not that she has any real pangs of guilt over her endeavors... in fact, she positively lights up when she figures out new and exciting ways to deal pot and stay one step ahead of ""the man"".

All ten episodes here are fun and involving, and go the extra mile by giving us a variety of interesting storylines outside the ""Nancy dealing drugs"" thing.  In particular, much attention is paid to issues related to a suddenly single mother now having to be her kids' sole emotional support, not just financial support.  And there's an absolutely bang-up season-ending cliff hanger, which nicely marries (some would say violently throws together) Nancy's personal life and her ""dealing"" life.  It makes you want to pick up season two of the show immediately, which is what I did.

Season one of ""Weeds"" is presented on two DVDs in a cute package.  There's also a handful of fun behind-the-scenes featurettes, but the contents of the shorter featurettes are pretty much duplicated scene for scene in the longer featurettes.  They should have just included the longer featurettes.  But that's the only quibble I have about this very entertaining set.

And if you need one more reason to purchase this first season of ""Weeds""?  With her alluring combination of sharp intelligence but frequent deer-in-the-headlights ""what have I gotten myself into?"" expressions, Mary-Louise Parker is very, very cute here.",1187136000,,2347,5.257372654155496

All you have to do is go down to the local shopping center watering hole or restaurant, and you'll find the slutty moms, the wasted dads and boyfriends, the divorcees and soon to be divorcees, not to mention their screwed up kids.

That's what's great about this show.  It's also what's scary. Oh, yeah, and these are all the people who voted for our illustrious current White House occupants (or is it ""occupiers""...but I digress) in the past couple of general elections.  You know....""the family value"" crowd.

2564248,4,B000FFJYE8,"I never had a chance to view this show when it was broadcast on TV, so I can't compare how it stacks up to the Blu Ray release (quality wise). This being my first time seeing the show, I found it very entertaining throughout and can't wait for the second season to come out.

I was very surprised with how much material was packed onto the Blu Ray disc - nearly 5 hours of HD Video (10 episodes a 30 minutes each), a Dolby EX audio track as well as a DTS 6.1 track. Commentary tracks, bonus featurettes and some neat features that I've yet to see on a Blu Ray disc prior to this (the ability to adjust menu transitions as well as bookmark scenes for later viewing).

The sound quality is fantastic - the 6.1 sound from the DTS track (even for a TV show) sounded great to me even though there aren't a whole lot of surround effects. The picture quality, however, was very mixed. Some scened looked great while others didn't look so hot. This is very common in dark scenes and did not come as a big surprise to me. Overall I'd give the video quality about a 3.5.
For a disc with so much content at such a low price (under $20), I can't help but recommend it even to those who own the show on DVD. One big improvement is that the Blu Ray is in Anamporhic 16:9 (widescreen) whereas the DVD release was cropped to a 4:3 (fullscreen) ratio.",1181260800,4,1334,4.186770428015564

The wait is worth it.  The Picture Quality is so much better than on the air. The show itself is awesome to say the least and you are going to be in for a treat at the end of Season 2 :)

As for the 1 star comment - I do agree.  There are 2 episodes where the picture quality looks very grainy.  After that tho, all episodes are perfect.  Does not bother me and I would buy it again knowing this!!

While the picture quality might not rank among the absolute top tier of HD transfers available for either format (and very few do), it is still a very clear, very high def image that I'd give between 3 1/2 and 4 stars.  I had a few episodes of season 1 saved on my DVR in high def.  The Blu-ray image blows away the broadcast image in terms of clarity and the absence of compression artifacts.  The one star reviewer either got a defective copy or doesn't have his system set up right.

There have been some disappointing HD discs that I have purchased (for both HD-DVD and Blu-Ray). You expect for the price of the discs that you will be getting the best... but with Weeds: Season 1 on Blu-Ray, the video quality is just unacceptable.

To be fair - I've only watched two of the ten episodes. BUT, I can say that episode one was not that impressive and episode two has some of the worst video compression I have ever seen on a high definition disc. So bad that I would compare it to watching a VHS tape on my 1080p television. Yes... a VHS tape. There really is no excuse for this. The two episodes that I have watched looked better when I watched them on HD broadcast. So I know they ""can"" look great, but why don't they?

Hope this helps you in some way. If you love the show, just beware that your high-def purchase isn't going to look very high-def. :(",1180915200,9,997,4.354838709677419
2564252,4,B000FFJYE8,"I liked Weeds S1 it was interesting and kind of a novel idea, however overall I thought the acting was very wooden and contrived and some of the storylines were very unrealistic. This show seems like ""Just Shoot Me"" mixed with ""The OC"" with some drugs mixed in. I mean come on, no drug dealer is going to just have sex with a rival and back off, this is where the  unreality becomes a little much, although the comedic nature of this series would explain this there wasn't much funny there. Overall the superficiality of this series is it's strength, otherwise we have another depressing journal of the death and destruction that is the real world of drugs that has touched everyone either directly or indirectly.

The best character is the drug dealing auntie who supplies the main character with her goods. I find the kids to be an uninteresting side story that are necessary to complete the setting only. The main character seems the least interesting to me, bumbling through it all with a blah attitude while things happen to her. The accountant is the most hilarious character coupled with the slacker brother in law, their adventures are the real comedy here. The chronicles of so called grown ups who are still teenagers is great.

This series is an above average one only because it's one of the premium channel series that can show anything it wants with no advertiser limitations. It's not particularly deep but is satisfying in its cliched ""California"" quirkiness and decadence that we all love to revel in. Yes this is the most decadent state in a decadent time, the great equalizing mediocrity that we are all a part of can only be laughed away so enjoy!",1180569600,,1667,4.7020547945205475

It begs the question, ""Is there really a place like this?, knowing well that the writers might have patterned the series after a place and people (with some exaggerations) they had actually experienced.  As indicated by my title, it is fun, it is something that could really happen to a young widow finding, suddenly, that she has to try to afford her two young sons the lifestyle to which they had become accustomed, basically just trying to make ends meet, missing having a father/husband around.

2564259,5,B000FFJYE8,"This Showtime adult comedy-drama has hit its stride following a quirky and unsure starting season.  The plot is simple and character driven, giving this cast a chance to shine as each episode reveals more character development and draws the viewer into the lives of these suburban slaves.

Weeds begins with the primary character, Nancy, (Mary-Louise Parker) living a upwardly mobile life which has come crashing down around her upon her husband's death.  All too real, he failed to provide for this possibility - no life insurance, no financial stability aside from his obviously sufficient salary, the first episode begins after his death, and immediately puts the viewer in the spectator seat as we watch Nancy try to deal with two kids (both boys) one a teenager and one just starting middle school.  She finds her house payments, car payments, maid, and lifestyle all too unaffordable, and as the pilot develops so does her temporary solution, dealing pot to her husbands friends as well as the husbands of her friends in their suburban utopia ""Agrestic"" CA.

As the season develops so does this fantastic character-driven Showtime Gen X soap-opera.  Kevin Nealon is perfectly cast as a dope smoking city councilman, and Nancy's dealer, (played by Conrad Shepard of ""40 Year Old Virgin"") really stands out as his realtively minor part blooms into the most compelling relationship in a black / white friendship turn possible romance I have seen on TV.  This show goes beyond a predictable comedy of errors and farce, showing the human side of suburbia and the foils and all too real human fraility behind the 100k a year salary drones who reside within.  Weeds is less about pot smoking or drugs than it is about people, and its casual acceptance of 30-something mother Nancy Botwin, yuppy mom turned pot dealer by a twist of fate accurately reflects the reality of their generation's attitude toward the failed 'war on drugs' - as far as pot smoking goes (Nancy is outraged by her children's use of the same drug she deals - reflecting the hypocricy of the whole issue of drug use and the do's and dont's surrounding it) and is more about how people - trapped in a lifestyle by circumstance and inertia - survive day-by-day.

This cuts off the left and right side of the picture.  If you have an old set, maybe it won't matter to you, but the default for DVDs is widescreeen anamorphic which allows the DVD player to show old screen format just fine for old TVs, or the full beautiful 16:9 picture for new DVDs.  If this show had originally been broadcast as full-screen (a codeword for 4x3) it might have been excuseable, but they should be ashamed to market this and Amazon should put a bigger warning on the DVD.",1174262400,25,676,4.435483870967742
2564263,5,B000FFJYE8,"Is this the show they cancelled DEAD LIKE ME to accommodate on Showtime?  If so, it wasn't a bad deal.  Like DEAD LIKE ME, WEEDS starts out a little bit on the overobvious side, and ""crude"" isn't the word for its brand of social satire.  (I will say that WEEDS does a far better job of seeming to be filmed on US soil than the Canada-centric DEAD LIKE ME.)  But once you get hooked on the show, you won't be sorry you pitched in and bought the whole set of 10 episodes, because they go like wildfire, and by the time the week was up, all we had left were the sticks and stems of this boxed set, and a whole pack of memories.

Mary Louise Parker has the role of a lifetime playing the suburban mom, widowed and without funds, who turns to dealing pot to make ends meet (and more).  Parker has always been a talented actress but here, the great thing is that she seems to be having fun; she's fully alive for the first time on screen.  I keep thinking that eventually she and Justin Kirk are going to have to get together (he plays the ne'er do well black sheep brother of her late husband), but the show's writers have delighftully tabled this romance for now.  For even if some of the individual episodes seem forced or undercooked, long term narrative arc writing is always surprising, rich.  You get the feeling that the people behind the show know what they're doing.  At first I was thinking, yes, it's cute for one episode, but how could a show like this be sustained?  Now I don't worry about that any more.  OK, I'm in the minority about Celia (Elizabeth Perkins).  In my opinion, she's awful and the writing for her character is absurdly bad.  To others, I know, she's a camp hoot.  I hate her, her relationship with her fat little daughter, her mirror relationship with her own mother, everything is hit you over the head twice.  As soon as she came on the screen I thought, ""And then she'll get cancer to show she's too wound up,"" and next episode, she's in chemo.  And by the way what happened to her older daughter, the one she sent to private school in episode one?  Did they just forget about her?  She's never mentioned again, it's like Richie Cunningham's brother on HAPPY DAYS, the one who went up to his room and never came back down again for the remainder of the series.",1173312000,3,2290,4.345882352941176

2564269,4,B000FFJYE8,"I'm not certain WEEDS would fly as high as it has without Mary-Louise Parker. She brings to the role of Nancy a range of expression, humor and pathos one seldom sees on or off cable. Without her, some humor here would fall flat because she's so often the ""straight man,"" deflecting and reflecting the insanity around her. She may be the dealer here, but she remains the most ethical character in the script.

Some reviewers have characterized WEEDS as soap, and others as black comedy. I view it an accurate portrayal of sick demographic slice of culture -- our affluent suburbs. Parts of its decadent charaters and situations are totally hysterical, but others -- involving the struggles of childen coming of age in this mess -- are painful.

One of the most poignant moments of the first series occurs at the end of Episode Six in which Nancy watches a video of sexual joy with her deceased Jonah. With her eyes and face she says ten thousand things about loss and abandonment. Few could evoke what she does so well here.

The script is literate and clever, and many of the supporting roles -- in particular those of Elizabeth Perkins and Justin Kirk -- are very well done, but their parts are written as caricatures compared to Nancy.

In WEEDS, all the separate pieces don't always hang together, nor are all the artfully contrived final scenes of episodes always artful. The audience rarely has any respite between Nancy's catastrophes, and the expletives in the script -- funny as they are -- sometimes become tiresome.

The full-screen transfer might have easily been produced in its original wide-screen splendor, but the transfer is still beautiful and true. The musical score is perfect and add much to the action.  The camera-work is fine in its study of faces, the complexities of body language and more.

At this price, these ten episodes are a steal, if only to showcase another expert performance by one of our most verstile actresses.  Mysterious and alluring one moment and clumsy or vulnerable the next, her range is amazing.

Buy it without regret, but keep younger children out of the livingroom when you watch it. The language and sexual situations are, art times, fairly explicit.",1170547200,2,2202,4.835106382978723
2564270,5,B000FFJYE8,Weeds is a great new show unlike any other.  The first season isn't that long but it's worth buying for sure.,1170547200,,109,4.190476190476191
2564271,4,B000FFJYE8,"At first galnce, Weeds may not be for everyone. And it's not. People may feel a little uneasy about the subject matter. However this is a show that will be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates good acting and good storylines.

The main focus of Weeds centers around Nancy Botwin (Mary Louise Parker). She's a widowed mother of two who supports her family by being the local pot dealer. As I said earlier people may shy away of this show because of that, and while it is the main storyline of the show, it's not the only one. I found myself enjoying it more than any reason for the fantastic acting of Parker. She nails this character. Everything about her is believeable. Though you can't base a show good on one actor alone, this one has plenty of fine actors.

Another character I loved was Celia. She is played by Elizabeth Perkins and let me say this show could easily revolve around her if the writers wanted it to. She has the acting chops, great lines, a good story, a very enjoyable addition to the show. SNL fans will be happy to see Kevin Nealon in the cast as well. I'm not a huge Nealon fan and I honestly don't think he brings much to his role. However he is a big name and that adds to the overall quality to the show.

This is a short season, only 10 episodes, but the story moves along nicely and will have you interested in seeing season 2 with it's great cliffhanger. Don't hesistate to see this show. I wasn't blown away with it though. It wasn't as witty as I heard it would be, not as funny as I thought it would be but one thing that surprised me was how deep you go into each characters story, and that's saying a lot with a short season.

While I feel this season could have been better, it makes up for what it lacks in the drama and character development department. You won't be disappointed.",1170288000,,1816,4.3011695906432745

2564284,5,B000FFJYE8,"Weeds originally a Showtime series has made a successful transition to DVD. The series stars Mary Louise Parker as a member of an ensemble cast. In the days of telecommuniting and work from home this seems like the ultimate gig. After the untimely death of her husband, Mary Louise becomes an unwilling family head and chief breadwinner but has limited career avenues and becomes the neighborhood pervaier of marijuana. The series chronicles her education in the trade as she interacts with an intriguing variety of individuals who act as her suppliers. In several episodes she learns the all important lesson that when you place an order from your supplier that payment is due with no credit allowed since she needs to leave her Range Rover as collateral. Things seem to go well until a competitor arises who additionally is a student in the high school. The central character seems to think this will be no problem after an honest discussion but she finds that he is selling to small children.  Throughout the series, she walks the proverbial tightrope by being able to separate the moral issues and the need to support her family. Early, in the series, her brother-in law arrives which initially was going to be a short visit but ends up staying longer especially after he becomes aware of her current employment.  One of the things that also ties the series together is the evolution into a business including the development of a bakery as the legitimate cover, encounters with other competitors and the continual interactions with her family. While the topic is controversial and is laced with sexual content,  it has an excellent cast.  It should be viewed with an open mind so it should be enjoyed for its entertainment value rather than some moral statement on society.",1163289600,3,1778,4.897009966777409

2564292,4,B000FFJYE8,"i will start off by saying i didn't think i'd like this show which was based partly to showtime's bad promotion and ignorance which i sometimes find myself guilty of... i thought it was just a desperate housewives knock off or something or that it was for ""older"" people (no offense to older people aha) but i was completely wrong.. if you have showtime like i do you are lucky because showtime has on demand which currently is running the full 2nd season which i watched 2 nights ago when i was bored.

the show is great on every level i don't think there is one bad thing i can think to say about it.

it basically follows a ""milf"" single mom in the suburbs taking care of her 2 sons and living with a maid who does no cleaning and her dead husband's brother who sort of acts as a father figure when he is not up to some kind of insane activity... oh i forgot to mention that her and some people close to her are drug dealers..  yah how can a show be bad with that premise it can't!

finally something that uses kevin nealon right!!! i always thought kevin nealon wasn't used properly in things i've seen him in and it's just great to see him used so well and he shines oh does he shine.. hilarious.

elizabeth perkins always bashing her fat daughter had me about falling out of my bed... she busts her daughter's balls ruthlessly about being fat and her daughter is always doing crap to get to her it's great.

justin kirk is magnificento as andy the brother in law.. his speech about masturbation to the youngest kid is an instant classic.. hall of fame stuff there.

i could go on about how each person is great but i think the picture is got... this is definitely a show that lives up to the hype.

2564298,3,B000FFJYE8,"I wish Netflix would identify the various cast names with pictures. Weeds, Season One has a large cast and I can't identify the characters to better guide you through a funny soap opera of suburban exaggeration.  Notice I did not claim there is a satire going on in the bedroom California community. Satire involves subtlety.  There's no subtlety here in Weeds. The opening credits start with the song about ""Little houses, Little houses,"" meaning that the burbs are cookie cutter, same same, so the jobs and life styles are boring.  But the weather is great, blue skies above, and really cool folks that smoke a lot of weed.  Since marijuana is illegal to possess or sell since the 1930's, there's a certain amount of hypocrisy going on, especially in dealing (er, no double entendre intended) with teenagers.

I believe Weeds to be a success using a time tested method:  I want to know what happens in the next episode or season because the characters have interested me enough that I can identify with them, even think about them after the lights have gone out. It is not clear from the pilot how burb homemaker Parker with the face of many expressions got hooked up with a black family that deal dope. Everybody is white in California except when Parker must score her weed.  Then we're in the Ghetto with Momma's family. And how Parker's wacko brother-in-law knows the same black folks is beyond me?  A little too much coincidence there you know.  In fact, Weeds suffers from a crescendo of forced situations, but heck, it's all about white bread dealing dope, so we forgive just because of the smarmy concept.

Teenagers in bed, burb wives in bed, positions, and heavy panting: these are the money shots of premium cable.  Otherwise, why would anyone pay extra for cable situation comedy shows? Is it something for the kids? NO!  But they watch this stuff anyhow.  That can't be good.  Just my opinion.

I'm no prude but blacks depicted as drug dealers calling each other the n-- word, boy isn't that cutting edge? I guess we've come full circle with blacks depicted as many blacks actually are (unfortunately) - tricked into the rebellious path of criminals by the pressures that their leaders and their culture still promote. Hey but this is a comedy - it's all tongue in cheek. We know they really don't mean it! It's like reverse psychology - how clever?

Boy it's cute to rebel - it's better to be an honest drug dealer than a hypocritical teacher, business person, or parent.

The makers of this drivel fit that category - so do the people who believe this program serves any worthwhile purpose.

2564307,3,B000FFJYE8,"UPDATED JAN.4th,2007: After stumbling across Season 2 episodes on Tv,I found the quality of the stories and pace to be so much better than the sluggish Season 1 episodes. Even the opening theme song is done differently each episode(with  a different singer each week or even as instrumental only). The acting and characters are also improved. I love ALL the characters and writing of Season 2 and wish they were 60 minutes long instead of 30 minutes. So,I guess it's worth watching Season 1 just to get you ready for the far superior and varied(though still as quirky) episodes of Season 2.

 The following review is for Season 1 only.

I expected to enjoy this series so much more. However,even though Mary-Louise Parker shows enough cleavage to keep most men interested during even the slow parts,she still refuses to do any nudity,so all we get is the odd nude shot of various other people. Every man she meets seems to fall in love with her in mere minutes,even though she appears so sad. Yes,I know her husband just died,so her sadness makes sense,but I'm thinking it's more her cleavage rather than her occasional smile,that gets them all hooked. I like Mary in everything she appears in,but there are so many dry spots and slow scenes in this series that I'm grateful each episode is only about 30 minutes long.

I thought much of the dialogue was clever and funny,but it didn't even come close to the greatness that Curb Your Enthusiasm or Huff easily reached in each episode. Yes,the series improved steadily with each episode,so the characters began to grow on me,especially by the last episode. I still can't get that great final scene out of my mind. That's the Mary-Louise Parker I was expecting. She can express so much with just her eyes. Not the somnolent Mary-Louise that exists for most of the series. No,I don't smoke pot and never will,but I suppose I'd be tempted to buy some from someone who looked like Mary and then I'd probably just give it to someone with glaucoma.

The other actors do a wonderful job,which keeps this from getting too depressing. I even didn't mind Kevin Nealon(I hate him in Curb), and thought he helped keep things light whenever he appeared onscreen.

Weeds has many songs that are quite catchy and are also well placed within each episode,which greatly added to the overall presentation of the series.

The dvd extras are OK at best,but why no deleted scenes?

So,do I plan to watch season 2?Probably not,unless Mary-Louise loosens up more. I've had enough for now. I enjoyed Weeds but just don't want to sit through anymore slow spots that I'm sure season 2 will also bring. So many people love this series,and I liked it enough to recommend it,but if you haven't seen the funnier Curb Your Enthusiasm or the both dramatic and funnier Huff,watch those Dvds first.

Weeds may ruin your garden,but this series is done well enough not to ruin the time spent watching it. It's far from perfect,but Mary-Louise Parker is in it,so please pass me a joint,I'm too busy staring at her.",1157414400,7,3026,4.746666666666667

Season one shows a good balance of the pros and cons of this business, and one struggling mother coping with all sorts of dilemmas. Good performances from all, tough the main black charachter Heylia James (Tonye Patano) seems a bit OTT - especially for us europeans. Keavin Nealons smoker happy dude Doug Wilson is a blast, and Mary-Louise Parkers Nancy Botwin is something to cherish. Good woman.

2564312,1,B000FFJYE8,"Weeds was not what I had hoped for at all. If you are expecting a light and funny show about a suburban mom who starts dealing pot to keep up her lavish lifestyle, this is not for you, either.

First of all, I can't really relate to ANY of the characters. The teens are WAY oversexed, and the teens-having-sex scenes are so not how teens have sex it's ridiculous. The younger child is really scewed up, but beyond anything I've ever imagined, the adults talk to these messed up youths with more vulgar language than you'd here in a bar, and the adults don't seem as concerned at how screwed up the kids really are. The youngest is supposed to be 9, and he has free control of a GUN and hunts the neighbors cat, thinking it's a mountain lion. He makes a video pretending he is a terrorist executioner beheading his playmate, and writes a terribly disturbing rap that even the school shrink doesn't do much about. Schools don't take these things lightly in this day and age, but in the show his behavior doen't seem to bother, let alone scare anyone. Um, No!

Then, in every episode there is a deeply depressing scene and/or montage of what life was like before the husbands death. Scenes that are deeply sad and painful to watch. Nancy watches a video of her and her late husband making love (she conviently has a beaytiful lovemaking session of tape for all eternity) as she sits and weeps, ending an episode where she was trying to figure out why she couldn't make herself climax now.

The most realistic characters are the black family Nancy gets the weed from, and even these characterizations seem racially offensive and mocking.

 Another point that seems absurd...Nncy and her late hubby had TONS of money, and he suddenly died leaving her with nothing. But a guy making the kind of money he must have been making to afford all that they had SURELY had some sort of life insurance through whatever company made him so rich. Hard to believe she just all of a sudden has nothing so that her eletricity and phones were getting cut off, or that she even had to buy her weed on""credit"".

While this show was  a great idea, it was not well-executed, and not at all the comedy it was advertised to be.",1156204800,26,2200,4.485
2564313,1,B000FFJYE8,"I wanted to put up a caveat for other fans who watch the show in HD.  Even though the show aired in widescreen on HD, the discs are the fullscreen version.  Yuck!",1156204800,25,162,4.03125
2564314,5,B000FFJYE8,"To be honest, I didn't like the first episode and I wondered what all the fuss was about.  But getting through that, and moving through the rest of the season was fun and funny and sometimes touching.  This is a terrific show about a new widow (Nancy, played by Mary-Louise Parker) trying to raise two boys and provide for them after her husband dies suddenly.
We never saw how she got into selling pot, but the focus of the show is showing Nancy trying to get her new 'business' to grow (excuse the pun) while trying to keep it secret from her kids, housekeeper and her best friend (Celia, played by Elizabeth Perkins).
While the Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy went to Parker, I really think the funniest character in the program is Elizabeth Perkins.  I love how she shaved her husbands hair off after she found out he cheated on her.  She swaps her overweight daughters chocolate stash for laxatives and pays the price when her daughter gets her back by switching her pills to imodium.
It's a break from the norm, but let me tell you this show is definately worth watching.  It's dark and funny and thoroughly enjoyable.  It's got a great cast and it's a show not afraid to take chances.  I especially love the unexpected twist in the very last scene of the last episode in this season.  I really love it and highly recommend it.",1155859200,12,1343,4.475409836065574
2564315,5,B000FFJYE8,"First off, I have to admit that I've loved Mary-Louise Parker for a long time, so I'm probably going to like any thing she's in.

That said, every one I've known who's watched this show has loved it.  It's funny and somewhat realistic.  The premise is that Parker is a recently widowed mom living in an expensive LA suburb.  To make ends meet she sells marijuana to her white, middle-class neighbors after buying it from a black family in a less affluent area.

This show is witty, sexy, and compelling.  If you watch about 3 episodes you'll be hooked.  The cast is excellent.  In addition to Parker in the lead role, you also have Elizabeth Perkins as the snooty neighbor/friend, Romany Malco (from The Forty Year Old Virgin) as one of her suppliers, and Kevin Nealon as her main client/CPA/city councilman.

The first ten episode follow Parker as he grows her business while trying to raise her two sons.  Along the way she has run ins with her competition and the law.  Plus she has to deal with her brother-in-law showing up and causing some extra problems.

It's a great show and it has a lot in common with ""Big Love,"" ""Desperate Housewives,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" or any other show that tries to point out the stranger side of life.",1155340800,13,1235,4.5636363636363635
2564316,3,B000FFJYE8,"Created by Jenji Kohan, co-writer of such acclaimed shows as GILMORE GIRLS and WILL & GRACE, the premium cable dramedy WEEDS teeters on the precipice of witty and raunchy, at times just going a little bit over the top. With such quality content produced by Kohan in the past (arguably on local cable channels that encouraged stepping around the politically incorrect elephant in the room), it is a little disappointing to see that one of the shaky legs on which this ten-episode first season stands is the knowledge that on Showtime, you can write as many dirty words as you want. For me, it actually ended up detracting from the experience as a whole as potty-mouthed potsmokers rattled off all kinds of NBC no-nos; however clever the writing, it seems like Kohan and crew are trying to hit a quota for bathroom humor that really serves no purpose at all to the overall story...

... which chronicles depressed widow Nancy Botwin (Golden Globe winner Mary-Louise Parker in her sharpest role yet) as she struggles to make ends meet in the backdrop of that cultural dystopia that is suburbia. After her husband's heart gave out on a morning jog, leaving her with two kids and an expensive house in the fictional community of Agrestic (fun fact: Agrestic is an anagram for ""cigarets""), she is forced to deal marijuana in her small community to the most unlikeliest of characters, such as city councilmember Doug Wilson. A new window opens for Nancy as she sees for the first time the seedy underbelly of her California community - stop me if you've heard this one before.

Subplots and season arcs are either a little hazy or too linear, like the painfully formulaic pilot which introduces and then axes a few characters, who are written off or simply never mentioned at all in the rest of the season. Silas is Nancy's angry teenage son who just wants to have sex, Shane is a grade schooler who is working through his five steps of grief by acting out for attention (and singling himself out in school as the weirdo), deadbeat brother-in-law Andy (Justin Kirk, who previously starred with Parker in the role that got her the Golden Globe) does drugs and dodges the American government to avoid being mobilized in Iraq, and that's not to mention the host of simpering PTA moms with ""hillbilly heroin"" addictions and fashion fixations, the token black family that serves as Nancy's dealers, and various other middlemen. In the allotted thirty minutes of each episode, there is no time for the pace to be bogged down - it's straight to the chase, quickly developing connections between characters that seem a little contrived but believable all the same.

As I'm writing this, the second season, highly anticipated after the sweet poison of last year's cliffhanger finale, is receiving quite a bit of hype with quirky commercials and magazine ads. Is it worth all the trouble? The honest, sober truth is: yes. It's fresh, it's funny, it cocks a satirical eyebrow in the face of steadfast right-wingers and addresses what America is coming to accept, and fast: green is the new alcohol, and it's not going to just disappear anytime soon. But why the vulgarity? Showtime's peach is looking more like a pit if last season's writers continue to feel out their boundaries and rub their base prose in viewers and cable channels' faces, while assuring the camera in DVD documentaries that this is the way Real Life is, the way Real People talk.",1155340800,5,3432,4.803722504230119

2564318,5,B000FFJYE8,"The pilot opens almost mid-story it seems, acclimating you to the characters and their interpersonal dysfunctions subtlety and sparingly.  The richness and vibrancy of the characters makes it ""ok"" that you don't get all the nitty-gritty details of why and when and how things started- you feel as if you know these people and will continue to learn about their why's, when's and how's as the ""plot thickens"" in season 2.

A fascinating exploration of suburban life- so common, easily identified with and yet totally beneath the surface. Of course it is dramatized, but after living in OC for over 10 years I can testify to the validity. The premise of this show is a terrific commentary on what suburbia has done to humanity as people try to make sure that all their ""Little Boxes"" stay the same. Our HOA recently sent letters to residents who were unfortunate enough to have brown spots in their lawns. I live in the desert and it's been unseasonably hot across the nation- but the semblance of normalcy must be protected in suburbia.  They may want to worry about the growth patterns of a different type of grass in our quiet little neighborhood.

I admire the main character, Nancy, who judges none and accepts tragedy and criticism both with grace and dignity. When a fellow mom and friend attacks her parenting by citing a book on parenting she is not baited by the comment, but retorts with an amusing grin and wryly delivered, ""Wow, Celia. (effective pause) I didn't know you read books."" The timing and rapport between these two characters is pure magic-the steel magnolias of the ""soccer mom"" set.

She is a real person in a real world, as plastic as it may seem- and she makes irrational, emotional decisions; she acts impulsively and impetuously, balanced with a carefully controlled, tender-hearted, frailty which makes her all the more likable. She displays the civility so rarely seen in our barely civilized civilization, while weathering the social slings of the socialites in her society.

The supporting cast of characters provide a rich and intricate skein to weave throughout the threads of storyline, some are a skosh stereotypical but in a way that works- making them familiar. Like real people we know, all of Nancy's ""people"" are imperfect and interesting - making it easier to connect the dots between the (probably purposely) missing why's, when's and how's.

A must see for the open minded. Plus the special features are more interesting than most TV series' DVDs.",1154390400,38,2491,4.902612826603326
2564319,4,B000FFJYE8,"The thing about this show that plunges in my flesh like a hot poker is that it is so TRUE to life! White, upper middle-class America has so much ""stuff"" while minorities suffer just to survive. The main character, played by Mary Loise Parker, buys weed from Black people and still has an aura of arrogance when she goes to their house to resupply. And God forbid they should get busted---she would be guaranteed to get a platinum deal from the prosecutor's office.  In her surburban world, minorities exist merely for maid service or some other form of exploitation.  While I enjoy the writing and the characters, it still pours acid on my soul that tens of millions of whites are able to exist in such a bubble of isolation.",1154304000,,725,4.569230769230769
2564320,2,B000FFJYE8,"I feel that sometimes suburbia gets a bad rapport.  Why wouldn't any American mind living in a safe neighborhood, with genuinely friendly people of middle-upper class representation, and sending their children to well endowed schools?  At times I believe we, as a nation, mock what we already have to somehow make it seem like a bigger issue than it already is.  Sure, it is easy to poke fun at identical houses, to soccer moms that drive SUVs, and the ability to believe that no evil occurs in these small pieces of the ""American Dream"", but in reality, don't we all wish we lived in some form of suburbia?  That is maybe a different discussion for a different day.  I recently had the opportunity to see what the television network Showtime felt about suburbia and their answers to the Soprano's (isn't every station trying to get a piece of this pie) popularity in the increasingly popular show Weeds.

Fried Green Tomatoes star Mary-Louise Parker headlines this show as a recent suburbia widow who has found the dutiful job of dealing to cover expenses and raise cash for her increasingly annoying family.  Without any indication of how she found this profession, we are submerged headfirst into her choppy life of dealing, mothering, and coping with her newfound popularity.  Through the course of the season she transforms her small town dealings to a true business with the groundlings of becoming a new Godfather of suburbia.  She runs into issues with local dealers, with her supplier, and even her neighbors as Nancy Botwin slowly develops from small housewife to an eventual big leaguer.

So, why didn't this series immediately make me smile?

To begin, I loved the opening song by Malvina Reynolds!  Her raspy voice introduced me to this series with eager eyes and ears.  I loved her song about suburbia, yet was somewhat confused.  Was this to be a series about suburbia or about dealing in the suburbs?  What I eventually discovered was that it played upon the already overplayed clichs about suburbia, while giving Parker the opportunity to live in a big house, drive a nice car, and co-exist in a pre-planned community while she sold drugs to those living around her.  Creator Jenji Kohan interestingly creates a counterpoint with Elizabeth Perkins, a great friend of Parker, who knows nothing of what is happening under her nose.  Perkins represents what we are to think those in suburbia believe, that nothing bad is happening in their own backyard.  I liked this juxtaposition, but what became increasingly annoying to me was the surrounding stories of our characters, and sometimes, the ""lack of"" stories that gave us nothing but tattered edges and jagged characters.  To begin, Kohan needed to give us the story of how Parker got into her newly discovered world of drug dealing.  While he will probably explore that further in other seasons, this would have been the one to do it.  I needed to see a good transition from suburban housewife to dealer, but instead all I got was an immediate dealer who apparently had built enough trust with her supplier to be as buddy-buddy as the first episode showed them to be.

With that flash beginning, I found myself struggling through the next several episodes.  I knew the characters, but never quite felt like I actually ""knew"" them.  I wanted to know more about Nancy and her husband.  I needed to see a stronger idea of their family life, especially Nancy's relationship with Silas and Shane pre-dealing.  I think this would have set us up for a stronger grasp around the characters.  I also felt that the stories were extremely clich.  Showtime had a brilliant premise here, but loaded it down with situations that I could see coming a mile away.  The issues with her children, the move-in of the classic Six Feet Under crazy brother-in-law (played by Justin Kirk), and a very strange relationship with her dealer Conrad/neighbor Doug Wilson.  I think I felt like I was rushed too quickly into this series.  I needed more defined moments.  I needed stronger connections.  Also, how did Nancy, in the course of about five to eight episodes, build up such a big client base?  Did anyone else think that this was just a bit too quick, even for television?  With a stronger character driven stories, more reality on the business of drugs, and less comedy about suburbia, I think Showtime would have had a definite hit on their hands, but with these obvious problems, it just never seemed to congeal well together.

I must admit though, the last three episodes of this series did make me a bit eager to watch the next season.  There is an obvious changing point in this first season, and for me it came with Nancy's interaction with the ""penny"" drug dealer.  That episode felt like a sucker punch to the gut.  What happened in that one episode did not seem to fit with the rest of the season.  After that obvious icebreaker, we seemed to head into a world too similar to that of The Sopranos, and I felt that Showtime was just trying to obviously steal viewers.  Maybe I went into this expecting too much, but it boasted itself as groundbreaking, but just like Huff, I felt like Weeds borrowed too much from the surrounding television shows.  Perhaps that it the direction that our programs are headed, maybe not, all I know is that Weeds was decent, just not great.  Parker didn't seem comfortable most of the time in her role, Perkins' big scare near the end felt enormously clich, and Nealon's talent just seemed wasted.  The only plus that I have about this show is the music.  It has introduced me to some great new albums.

Overall, I don't think I could watch this season again.  I think it will get better with age, but there needs to be a stronger push towards characters in the next season instead of just ""shock"".  Drug dealers in suburbia are no different than New Jersey mob living in extremely ritzy neighborhoods.  I felt a bit cheated watching this season, yet the cliffhanger ending left me wanting to see more.  I have hope for Weeds, but I am not holding my breath.

2564321,4,B000FFJYE8,"WEEDS is a complicated series currently airing on the cable network SHOWTIME, the same corp. that brought us DEAD LIKE ME and other controversial storylines. And WEEDS certainly is wonderfully bizarre.

Mary-Louise Parker (THE WEST WING) stars as Nancy Botwin, a recent widow with two children and a cash flow problem. She lives in the fictitious town of Agrestic in Anywhere Suburbia, America. In fact, the shows lead-in goes through great pains to show us how common an area she and her family live in. This is vital since most of today's drug culture tends to live right under our proverbial noses. And the drug, as the title intends, is marijuana, often considered shameful by some to be considered ""illegal"" while others throw tantrums about its gateway significance. But Nancy has to feed her family and she'll do whatever it takes to ensure their survival.

In the midst of this seemingly benign town we have a troop of old and new pot smokers. The older generation is exhibited by none other than Kevin Nealon (ANGER MANAGEMENT) whose character, Doug Wilson, is a bored and immature accountant. Self-centered and completely useless in terms of assisting his neighbors, his character is absolutely fantastic. You could easily picture him still in high school if it weren't for his extremely receding hairline and the family minivan he drives. The newer generation is brought to light by Nancy Botwin's brother-in-law, Andy, played by the excellent Justin Kirk (FLANNEL PAJAMAS, 2006). He has no direction in life and is now firmly entrenched in Nancy's home. His failings at life are mirrored through his careless attitudes toward women or growing in any meaningful way. But once in a while -- just occasionally -- he'll make a remark of wonderful profoundness that blows Nancy away. He also is a much needed father-figure (although a VERY screwed up one) for Nancy's two boys, Shane (Alexander Gould, FINDING NEMO) and Silas (Hunter Parrish, RV). It is Silas, the high schooler, whom we get to see experiment with the emerging drug culture that surrounds his household. Although initially unaware of his mother's ""business"", he quickly reveals to the viewer that he's ""not stupid"" about what's happening under his own roof.

Nancy's friends are a mixed bag. Celia (Elizabeth Perkins, BIG), is a member of the PTA, has a child who suffers with being overweight, and recently found out her husband had an affair with the local, and beautiful, Asian tennis instructor. As the series progresses, we learn that Celia has breast cancer and this comes as devastating news for someone so infatuated with one's appearance (as seen through the mother-daughter relationships). The Shepard's, a black family that live in a ""bad part of town"", act as Nancy's suppliers of the green leaf. They battle finances versus keeping their business strictly business whenever Nancy comes around (which fluctuates as her business expands and contracts).

The wonderful thing about this series is that it puts a mess of moral material in the viewer's lap. What is wrong with marijuana when Percocet and other heavy narcotics are readily available via a doctor's prescription? Is it wrong for a person to support their family by dealing in something as shady as drug trafficking? Can a woman be both a loving and compassionate mother while at the same time selling something potentially addicting? Is it hypocritical for someone to sell ""the stuff"" while at the same time punishing their kids when they catch them doing some of it? Quite a moral quagmire, I'd say.

The other thing that makes this series work is it's sexy. Mary-Louise Parker has that ...something about her that makes her both a respectable looking woman and just a tad slutty. She's a sexual being who struggles with life in the shadow of her husband's death and has to decide what's best for her, her kids, and her husband's memory; most times these things are in direct opposition of each other. Elizabeth Perkins mirrors much of Parker's character in that she too has that respectable/slutty look but also some uppityness ...until her cancer rears up. Then she becomes more introspective and the slut takes over, for a while.

The series producers also put in a deaf and sexually promiscuous girlfriend for Nancy's son, Silas. This added an entirely new dimension to Silas' character as he's forced to grow-up without a father to guide him through this teenage sexual minefield and he finds solace with the deaf girl's household more than with his own whenever internal family problems arise.

This first season took about two episodes to get rolling, but once it did there was no stopping it. You really need to open your mind to the possibilities surrounding this show. It's not JUST about drugs. It's about the people that are shoved into this niche group for the sake of survival, and it's captivating to watch how their flawed lives intermingle. Pot smoker or not, these characters are headed for interesting days. Season two has already been purchased by SHOWTIME, which would indicate WEED might be picking up speed and continue smokin' for some time.",1153872000,31,5112,4.985932004689332
2564322,3,B000FFJYE8,"""Weeds"" is an excellent show with clever humor, hot social issues, and engaging characters.  Some reviewers have pointed out that the characters are hypocritical and not very likeable, but that's what gives them complexity and makes them interesting.  ""Full House"" this is not.  That aside, the general tone of the series is not terribly serious, so however you feel about drugs and the actions of Nancy and the other characters, it's still a quite enjoyable and fun show.

I felt that since the producers of this DVD did not see fit to release the episodes in their original aspect ratio, that was worth knocking off a good two points.  It's often easy to tell that things are framed too closely here.  It's incomprehensible why they would not release the best possible version on DVD, especially when they expect people to pay for them.  The set does include some interesting extras and featurettes.  I also listened to all the commentaries, and what annoyed me were those of show creator Jengi Kohan--on her tracks she sounds as though she's coming out of anesthesia.  I just want to scream at her ""SPEAK UP!""  So if you're into commentaries, pretty much skip hers (the ones for the pilot and the season finale), as ""mumble mumble mumble mumble"" is hardly an insight.",1153699200,51,1270,4.811059907834101
2564323,5,B000FFJYE8,"""WEEDS"" is the best show on currently on television. It is subversive and hilarious and touching. Mary-Louise Parker is genius, in an award calibre role. It's also the best work of Elizabeth Perkins career.",1153612800,6,206,5.088235294117647
2564324,4,B000FFJYE8,"I think that in its heart of hearts, ""Weeds"" wants to be a black comedy.  After all, when her husband drops dead, Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker) decides to support her family, which consists of her two sons, Silas (Hunter Parrish) and Shane (Alexander Gould), by selling marijuana in suburbia.  Not just in any suburb, but the gated community of Agrestic, California, where the other women might look like they are from Stepford but their topics of discussion are strictly Peyton Place.  But I do not think we need to go back that far to example the dynamic of ""Weeds,"" because what we are talking about here are the ""Desperate Housewives"" of Wisteria Lane on drugs, and as the title gives away, the drug of choice here is marijuana.  Actually, that would be the ""herb of your choice,"" because that is the special ingredient in all of the Agrestic Herbal Recipes includes on the special features of the season one DVD.

Marijuana is not a gateway drug in the wacky world of ""Weeds,"" and Nancy might be a dealer but she is also a mom, so if somebody starts dealing to 10 year olds she is more than willing to find them jumping on a bed in their underwear and to sit on them and read them the riot act (okay, actually she has to use coercion, but you get the moral position here).  The people of Agrestic do not do harder drugs, they just smoke weed, and eat brownies (and hash browns and pot roast and, well, you get the idea).  So, yes, just about everybody on the show is doing drugs, but they are not doing bad drugs, they are just smoking (and eating) weed.  In other words, weed is not a hard drug it is a soft drug and people who take it get silly and or horny, which for a half-hour dramedy (black dramedy?) that airs on Showtime would pretty much be a prerequisite.  Funny that things have not really progressed all that much from the classic anti-marijuana films of the 1930s, like ""Reefer Madness"" and ""Assassin of Youth,"" which proved once and for all that smoking grass makes you giggle uncontrollably.

Selling weed is only part of Nancy's life, because both of her sons are presenting her with problems.  Silas wants to have sex with her girlfriends and Shane, who was with his father when he dropped dead, likes to respond aggressively to being bullied, which means he gets suspended from elementary school a lot (""You Can't Miss the Bear"").  One of the few people in Agrestic who is not smoking Nancy's weed is Celia Hodes (Elizabeth Perkins), the president of the Agrestic Elementary School P.T.A., whose older daughter is the one Silas wants to have sex with.  Celia is the sort of person who thinks diet soft drinks should be available to the kids at school and who calls her youngest daughter Isabelle (Allie Grant) ""Isabelly"" as part of constant pressure to lose weight.  This is a mother-daughter war that gets dirty a way you have seldom seen before (""Good S*** Lollipop"").  Then again, Celia does teach us that there are clearly worse things in this world than having Coke bottles from a Cessna fall through your roof (""Fashion of the Christ"").

""Weeds"" could be an interesting show without the marijuana because, after all, we are talking about Mary Louise Parker and Elizabeth Perkins here, which is a pretty dynamic duo (Parker grabbed a Golden Globe for her role and Perkins is up for an Emmy this year).  But some of the funniest stuff here happens when the white lady goes to the house of her supplier, Heylia James (Tonye Patano), and proves how far in over her head she is in this new business venture.  Fortunately Heylia's nephew Conrad Shepard (Romany Malco) takes a liking to Nancy or she would really be up the proverbial creek without a paddle (""The Punishment Lighter"").  Nancy's C.P.A., Doug Wilson (Kevin Nealon) is helping her hide her income when he is not buying her weed, and over the course of the first season she slowly puts together a support group that can help her move up the food chain of her chosen business.  Unfortunately her brother-in-law Andy (Justin Kirk) has showed up and moved in and the guy is a walking advertisement for weed being too much of a good thing at some point that he apparently reached years ago (""Lude Awakening"").

In terms of ideological assault ""Weeds"" burns its satire at both ends of the political spectrum, which would mean everybody will find something to laugh at and/or be offended by, or probably both.  This might be an idealized version of the marijuana business, but Nancy has spunk and it suddenly occurs to me that this show might also be ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" on drugs, because we have the feeling that Nancy just might make it after all.  That is until the final shot of the first season when she turns on the light in the bathroom and sees what is embroidered on the shirt she grabbed to put on when she got out of bed in the middle of the night (""The Godmother"").  The second season should be interesting and hopefully Showtime will keep ""Weeds"" around longer than they did ""Huff.""  Final Note: Gould was the voice of both Nemo in ""Finding Nemo"" and Bambi in ""Bambi II,"" which is why he sounds so familiar but you cannot place the face.",1153526400,5,5141,4.580152671755725
