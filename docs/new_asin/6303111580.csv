561201,1,6303111580,Enter commentI rented Miss M along with 2 other videos a week ago. I WAS able to download one purchase but UNABLE to download this & 1 other.  I have emailed Amazon 3 times.  The first 2 times I received replies re: ways to fix the problem so that I might receive the others. (I had no problem downloading the 1st purchase on the same computer with same settings.) The 3rd email I sent several days ago & have received no response.  I have requested a credit to no avail. The UNBOX is UNSATISFACTORY,1170979200,4,499,4.287234042553192

7837692,5,6303111580,"Aunt Jane finds herself at a local an annual summer garden party hosted by the new owners of Gossington Hall. The new owner is an aging movie star who is at odds with the studio producing the latest movie. A visitor mysteriously dies. People start dropping like flies and the Movie Star (Marina) knows she is next. The title of the movie is taken from ""The Lady of Shallot""

Joan Hickson is Miss Marple. Agatha Christie always considered her as the ideal Miss Marple; she shows this through her reserve savvy. Jane takes an interactive interest in the mystery and yet each character as part of the discovery, stands on their own. The ending of the story is as is in life, it is appropriate not black and white judgmental.",1501113600,,721,4.546153846153846
7837693,4,6303111580,"The Mirror Crackd from Side to Side was one of the wonderful BBC adaptations of Agatha Christies Miss Marple novels that starred Joan Hickson as the spinster sleuth in the 1980s and early 1990s, when they were also shown in the US on PBS Mystery!. Agatha Christie borrowed the title from a line in Lord Tennysons poem The Lady of Shalott, which is quoted in the film. The plot was inspired by the now-famous real-life experience of a certain Hollywood actress of the Golden Age. Ive seen this plot so many times, that I recognized it right away, which takes a bit of the fun out of it. But Agatha Christie may have been the first to appropriate the story for a fictional work. A writer of murder mysteries would find the real-life tragedy and improbable coincidence irresistible.

In the village of St. Mary Mead, Mrs. Dolly Bantry (Gwen Watford) has sold the enormous Gossington Hall after the death of her husband, and moved into a cottage on the estate. The new owners are aging American movie star Marina Gregg (Claire Bloom) and her director husband Jason Rudd (Barry Newman), both in England to film a movie. The Hollywood couple are gracious enough to host the annual charitable garden party. All goes well, until Heather Badcock (Judy Cornwell), a big Gregg fan, falls ill and dies after drinking a cocktail. Miss Marples nephew, DI Dermot Craddock (John Castle), is assigned the case and seeks his aunts advice. When it is determined that Heather died from drinking Marinas barbiturate-laden cocktail, the list of potential suspects lengthens.

Unfortunately, many in the audience will recognize this plot -and therefore the culprit- before the denouement. But, if this adaptation of The Mirror Crackd from Side to Side has a flaw, it is that we don't see much of Miss Marple. Shes not as active a sleuth as usual. People tend to bring information to her, as opposed to her going out and snooping. One of those people is Miss Marples aristocratic friend Mrs. Bantry. Shes an appealing character, and Gwen Watford is perfect in the role. There is also a subplot involving a tiresome housekeeper whom Miss Marple is trying to jettison gracefully, after an overprotective physician insisted that she needed someone to watch over her. Margaret Courtenay plays Miss Knight to irritating perfection, providing a comic subplot.",1468108800,,2329,4.908629441624366

7837695,5,6303111580,"I watched the movie on my kindle fire while I was walking on the treadmill.  It certainly kept me entertained, always wondering what was going to happen next.  I thought the actors were great.",1393632000,,192,4.617647058823529
7837696,5,6303111580,Loved seeing Clare Bloom..................I like Joan Hickson in this role very much.  She just has something special.  Her facial expressions are priceless....all the acting was superb.........enjoyed Barry Newman also.  The English countryside always plays a central part for me.,1390435200,,281,6.153846153846154
7837697,5,6303111580,Joan Hickson is THE Miss Marple.  This is an outstanding movie version of a great book.  I only wish they'd made more of them with this actress.,1384819200,,144,4.296296296296297
7837698,5,6303111580,"Again, Miss Hickson does not fail to entertain. This story especially is very well done.  The story has a lot of twists and turns and just when you think.....you have it........another wrinkle occurs.",1376352000,,200,5.0606060606060606
7837699,5,6303111580,"The poor village of Saint Mary Mead is invaded by some American actors and actresses for the shooting of a film. The main actress was actually raised in the village before moving to America. It's obvious Miss Marple does not consider cinema actors as very respectable people, though that is no reason to kill them. But apparently it is by far enough to justify their suicide. The story is sordid about the past, but that is nearly nothing when compared with the sordidness of the present they impose onto themselves and one another. Working conditions of actors and actresses are horrific and producers are the worst exploiters that can exist and they deserve our full and complete condescending contempt. Add into that picture a couple of adopted children, rejected afterwards, and then a real child reduced to an incurable fate by German measles during the pregnancy and you have the squalid reality of this case. So it is nearly nice of Jane Marple to overlook the slight detail that the death of that actress was not entirely natural though it looks suicidal, or maybe not entirely suicidal though it looks absolutely natural, or whatever other mixture with artificial added in the lot. In one word good riddance and just hope God is just as understanding as we are not.
