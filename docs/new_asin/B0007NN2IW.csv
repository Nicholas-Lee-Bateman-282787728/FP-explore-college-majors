2223639,5,B0007NN2IW,"The Nikon D70/D70S DVD is an excellent resource for gaining additional information about the camera. Like a book, you can review all the information, or jump to certain sections for refresher info.

This was a great purchase for me.",1126569600,10,232,4.948717948717949
2223640,4,B0007NN2IW,"This DVD is a useful guide to Nikon's amazing D70.  It demonstrates many of the practical uses of the D70's Exposure Modes, which lie beyond the automatic point-and-shoot settings.  It also demonstrates the purpose of each knob and button.  If you can't afford Nikon School, this DVD is reasonable alternative.",1126483200,9,310,5.16
2223641,3,B0007NN2IW,"I thought this dvd for the price was great. I would not pay much more for it. The owners manual that comes with the camera discribes the features and functions as if you already know about digital SLR's. This video ""dummy's"" it up a bit. It does need to talk more about how to take better pics than how to use computer software. Over all i do recommend this dvd, it's cheap and helpful.",1120780800,7,386,4.22972972972973
2223642,4,B0007NN2IW,"I am so grateful for Blue Crane Digital.  This DVD helped me so much; I can not find words that would fully describe my gratitude!

This DVD is perfect for people who DO NOT KNOW how to operate the D70 to take GREAT pictures. When I received my D70 on April 16 I opened the box AND WAS TOTALLY LOST AFTER READING THE MANUAL. I felt overwhelmed. I love photography and I wanted a good Camera, however to make great pictures not ORDINARY ones; I knew the camera could not create skillful operation for me... I needed help, and quick. I tried for several days on my own to learn various basic principles and felt totally frustrated and I do not have a learning disability. I wanted to continue to love the camera and not be held hostage by the dissatisfaction of my skills.

I searched Amazon.com and found this DVD; After viewing the DVD for the first time and following the easy instructions and great advice my skill level expanded greatly in days. My performance and knowledge increase every time I watch this rendition of quick expansion (DVD).  The narrator's speech is rhythmic and he gives simple clear instructions with many visual examples of what to do and how. A definite example of ""a picture is worth a thousand words.""  I have spent much money on how to books that attempt to discuss what is presented in this DVD. I could have saved myself much time, money and frustration if I had known about this DVD.  However, I know now so HURRY and buy one of the remaining copies.

I would have given a rating of 5 stars if the DVD was carried by Amazon.com and not the marketplace sellers. This item should be a member of Amazon.com's inventory.

Nikon, this DVD should be shipped with every purchase of the Nikon D70 Digital SLR!",1115078400,32,1734,4.482539682539683
2223643,4,B0007NN2IW,"This video is an excellent guide to the D70. I almost didn't buy it as a result of reading the review below. In my opinion, the quality is fine and the information is very helpful. The D70 has alot of features that take some time to get comfortable with. The video gave me what I needed to get started and then was a great reference as I got more experienced. I found watching the video was a good start. Then I got out and took some pictures. Then watched the video. Then took more pictures. Then watched the video again. You get the idea. I have found it helpful each time I have watched it. The only improvement I would make is to have additional videos available to proceed to more advanced topics once you get this one mastered.",1112832000,21,733,4.280575539568345
2223644,3,B0007NN2IW,"This DVD could have been a great video had the producers chosen to confine their visual presentation to the product, and hired a narrator with the ability to pronounce words professionally.  Unfortunately, this DVD favors talking-head time over product time. The narrator's eyes move visibly as if too close to the cue cards, and the harsh lighting glares off his skin oil.

However, even if this DVD's producers had the good sense to do a straight voice-over with full product visuals, the chosen narrator would still be a major distraction due to his kindergarten command of enunciation.  Instead of ""picture"", he says the term most people use to describe a person who throws a baseball at a batter, or the container used to hold lemonade.  Instead of ""temperature"", he says ""temp a chur""; instead of ""aperture"", he says ""appa chur"" and so on.  I fully expect that if he described nuclear spaghetti and the library, it would become ""nukuler pasgetty at the lie-berry""

The script abets in this disasterous monolog by undermining the more common terms of photo, photograph, portrait, etc. and instead doggedly repeating ""picture"" practically every other sentence.  Personally, I believe this narrator should not have been burdened with a script containing any word with more than one syllable.

""Pic"" would have been the best choice.

In conclusion, this video has some good information and is best suited for those who believe the center portion of large words are optional and prefer to skip over them.",1110844800,10,1505,5.036290322580645

8049378,1,B0007NN2IW,I found this dvd so difficult to watch that I ended up returning it. My dvd looked as if a video camera was set up on a tripod with the background in focus.
