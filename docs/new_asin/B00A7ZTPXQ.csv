8548067,5,B00A7ZTPXQ,Its worth the money for Tozawa against Hero. Seriously.,1426377600,,55,5.222222222222222
8548068,5,B00A7ZTPXQ,This DVD is amazing!!! Every match is great Generico VS Pac at All Star Weekend V - Night 1  was awesome. Hero VS Danielson at Guerre Sans Frontires  is a match that many people think is the best match in PWG History. Kenny Omega vs. Davey Richards at As The Worm Turns was a classic and than  El Generico & Paul London vs. The Cutler Brothers vs. The Young Bucks at Seven was a classic Guerrilla Warfare match. If You love Pro Wrestling You must buy this DVD.,1398038400,,460,4.204545454545454
8548069,5,B00A7ZTPXQ,"This is an excellent dvd set. Great matchs, exteremly fun crowd. The comentary is gold. This is turly a great set for any fan of wrestling. Be it causal or hardcore indy fan. This will entertain the hell out of you. Just put it in and give it a chance. You won't be disapointed. This is a fun set that keeps you well entertained. The talent is turly some of the best in the world. Many of the guys on this are now working for WWE. So yes you will get to see what they can do. Without the whole WWE tone it down, no we don't do that or thats not going to get over. Do as we say even if its crap. Flat out this dvd set is one of the best wrestling sets going. For 19.99 and shipping its well worth the money. You get a lot of wrestling a lot of laughs and you won't feel cheated at all. Its turly a joy to watch start to finish. Just like with many PWG dvds. Keep the really young kids away from this. Unless you turn off the comentary first. Or watch it your self and decide how you feel about them hearing it.",1377907200,,1009,3.8792270531400965
8548070,5,B00A7ZTPXQ,"This is a must buy, not just for fans of independent wrestling, but also for anyone who enjoys pro wrestling in general.",1375488000,,120,4.5
8548071,5,B00A7ZTPXQ,"What more can I say? If you are a fan of Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, this is a no-brainer. That is, unless you already own every DVD they have already put out. I would still suggest buying this so that they make more money and continue to put on great shows!",1362441600,,255,4.12
8548072,5,B00A7ZTPXQ,"Honestly, PWG might be the best wrestling promotion in the country for hardcore wrestling fans.  PWG sells out 1 and 2 rightfully have 5 star reviews and the third installment is no different. This DVD set is full of HIGHLY entertaining matches for all kinds of wrestling fans. It has techincal, hardcore, highflying, stiff, and any other kind of pro wrestling you can imagine.  Get this set before it becomes as rare and expensive as the first two.  The PWG compilations are absolute must haves for wrestling fans, particularly if you can't afford to by tons of events like me.",1358553600,,578,4.76
