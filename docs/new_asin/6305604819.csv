But if you like non-stop ""beat people up"" movies this is one to watch. it  could have been a little better, but who knows what was left on the floor  when it was done for american release.",944784000,,323,4.193548387096774
1047970,5,6305604819,"This movie is incomparable. I saw it three times in theaters and each time converted a new, previously sceptical friend. Jet is as endearing as ever, but more importantly, the fight scenes cannot be matched. They had to write  Jet's character's superhuman background into the story simply to justify  how fast he moves. You won't be disappointed.",939427200,14,346,5.052631578947368

1048107,3,6305604819,We watched this film when it was first released so I watched it again. Jet is awesome as ever and you get a true appreciation for the evolution of the action movies between the current and past directing methods. Action films are hard to transition from paper to film because violence is usually spontaneous in real life. The plot is typical good guy bad guy dilemma drama. I enjoy all Jet Li movies and like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan movies this early Jet film will give you a real good representation of the improvement to characters and scripts that Jet appears in more recently. Not a film for Broke Back or Golden Pond junkies.,1479168000,,632,4.504347826086956

When this movie was released in US theatres it was heavily edited and the soundtrack was replaced with a terrible hip hop/techno mashup that had no connection to the film. This is the complete version with the original soundtrack.

I bought this for nostalgic reasons since I use to really love this film when I was younger.. that said, I really expected more from a BluRay. this has to be the worst digital transfer I have purchased. The quality is identical to the DVD, which wasn't great and there is visible ""snow"" and ""artifacts"" throughout the film that actually make it look worse now that it has a full high-def presentation.

The audio is a real let down because it is not remixed for the surround but instead just sounds muddled and choppy.

If you love the movie and its cheap, get it, but it isn't worth picking up if you already have the DVD. I actually put the DVD on to see if it was just memory loss that I thought it looked beer or I was actually correct.. the upscaled DVD looed beter because it was not bleached out and did not pick up all the noise..",1396828800,2,871,4.209580838323354

But I still think that they should have done more realistic martial arts. Of course, Jet Li knows Chinese Boxing. But what is Chinese Boxing? I want to know; the audience wants to know.

Picture quality: 4/5

This looks much better than my UK DVD which was heavily cropped and had lousy picture quality. There also seems to have no DNR applied to the film. It looks raw and has the grain. Too bad it didn`t have AVC or VC1 codec. There is a HK BD, but i think the American looks better, in terms of colour and details.

The HK BD have too much DNR that takes away the details + have crushed blacks and strange oversaturated colours. The only good thing about the HK BD is that it has the original uncensored version with it`s original language.

Audio quality: 4/5

I think quality of the English: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 is pretty good. Too bad about the scratching Rap music, i like Rap music, but not in this type of film. I think the original music was suited better. I remember the explosions, music and guns had good bass.

1051240,3,6305604819,"So I enjoyed the dvd version of this movie and saw amazon had the blu-ray on sale for half price so i bit. Actually i consider it lucky to get these chinese martials pictures in high def at all over here since they are so low budget and often times don't even get put out here.

Anyways There are quite a few flaws in this blu-ray. I won't say its as bad as the other review, it is DEFINATELY an improvement. I put in the dvd afterwards to double check. Viewing on a computer with a Dell 24 inch monitor, the Blu-ray definately has WAY more color information and the detail is definately much better in the blu-ray. That said It of course is not going to match a reference quality dvd that actually has a proper transfer done to it, And to be honest, the original movie probably was not shot on that great of film stock, again lower budget. It appears that the DVD and blu-ray have identical issues in certain scenes. When the two good guys are playing their chinese checkers or whatever game it is, there are a few shots of the 'cop' that are so grainy its painful. The worst i've seen on any blu-ray, but when i popped in the dvd i noticed this grain is ALSO there, just not as noticible becuase the dvd is darker and not as bright or vivid of an image, so the grain is not quite as noticible but still DEFINATELY there. That tell's me they both came from the same master with no upgrades..

Here's a REALLY wierd issue with this blu-ray that is NOt on the DVD and makes me kind of want them to fix it and exchange my disk. During the fight scene with the last drug lord, (the guy in the plastic suit) when jet li is parachuting in, the sound gets REALLY messed up.. right before he unbuckles his parachute, you can hear running footsteps in the water and a kick/punch sound. After he drops out of the parachute, and the sniper guy hits the ground, you then see jet li run up and kick him in the face, again these footsteps with water play (but this time it synchs up with the action), then you'll hear an extra punch sound when no one is being hit, then you'll see a scene of the 'cop' guy hanging from a ledge, and AGAIN you'll hear this 'footsteps and kick' sound, with no action on the screen matching this.. Someone got EXTREMELY happy with the sound effects during this whole fight scene and its really sloppy and irritating. I'm not sure how you screw this up when the regular dvd did NOT have this issue (i compared scenes just a few ago, and its not present on the DVD). Nice job lions gate, Let me know next time, i'll make it NOT suck for free.

Over-all the movie is still a DEFINATE upgrade to the DVD, if you don't let the sound issue during that one fight scene annoy you. The movie still has a bit of grain all over the place, and the worst scene is only that chess playing scene early on. There's a few out of focus shots, but they were like that on the DVD, don't expect pure bliss when upgrading to the Blu-ray but it definately has more color, more detail and just is much nicer looking than the dark and dated DVD of yester-year. And if you can pick up for the 7.99 price that it was on sale, its totally worth it.. At full price? I'd probably pass, but any sale price is going to be a good deal for the jet-li fans.

I was really looking forward to this movie coming out on blu-ray and was very disappointed in it when I finally got the chance to watch it.  I loved this movie when it came out on dvd with its ""campy"" storyline and martial arts action.  This blu-ray version is barely an improvement over the dvd.  I watched this on a PS3 system and hdtv with an Onkyo TX-SR606 receiver and a decent set of surround sound speakers so I was able to take advantage of the 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack available on the disc.  The video was very ""grainy"" looking and barely looked ""cleaned up"" at all.  I put in my standard dvd version of this movie and could hardly see any difference at all between the two.  The sound wasn't much of an improvement either.  The background music sounded pretty flat throughout the movie and the only improvements were in the explosions and some of the higher action sequences.  Whoever did the blu-ray transfer of this film really ""dropped the ball"" on this one.  As far as the movie itself, if you have never seen it, you are in for a treat and a fun ride with this one.  For those of you who have seen the movie and were looking for a high-quality upgrade, I would recommend renting it first to see how you like it before shelling out the bucks to purchase a copy.",1220400000,27,1354,4.333333333333333

1051282,3,6305604819,"First off, the action in this film is great.  Jet Li can kick some major butt, and the scenes with him and Franoise Yip are very good.

The detective friend is funny, the dub is amusing, they went with a kind of Bogart vibe on the voice.

The dub for the girl Tracy is annoying... high pitched and whiney, but she's a plucky enough character to not be completely irredeemable.

All in all, good action movie, and Jet Li is pretty studly as the Black Mask.  (although corrugated cardboard is not what I'd have pictured as good mask material)",1148256000,2,540,4.414141414141414
1051283,4,6305604819,"I can't remember ever seeing a superhero Hong Kong action movie. You would think it would be something obvious to do considering the dynamic action styling of Hong Kong action films. Sounds like a good idea? Well The Black Mask delivers on that idea. Combine insane stunt work and martial arts choreography along with a masked crime fighter and you get a superhero movie with action that will put Hollywood to shame.

As with many superhero movies the plot isn't what you call complex or involved. It is just a simple super-villain-with-a-master-plan kind of affair here. The interesting thing about Black Mask is what they do in between the fight scenes and evil plots. You get a good look at the relationships between our hero and his friends and co-workers. Things like a fledgling romance and conflicts of interest with friends actually work here. After a bit of character development the plot thickens and the bullets start to fly. This isn't high art on the script side, but then again if you shouldn't be expecting that in the first place. Hong Kong action films aren't known for gripping stories, just high-flying action. At least here you get a solid story, solid back story, with all the action goodness.

Okay lets get to the nitty gritty. The Black Mask is a martial arts film at its core, and I gotta tell you the martial arts rock. The choreography done in the fight scenes are not only tight but they are fast and furious. Jet Li definitely shows his stuff on this one along with a few other martial artists. It puts just about every fight scene from Hollywood to shame. This movie obviously pays homage to Bruce Lee's Kato character from the Green Hornet television shows. The special effects do go crazy at times with all the explosions, blood and body parts flying around. Even crazier are seeing some things like colored smoke for no reason and Silly String (yes... Silly String). The English dubbing isn't great, but to be honest it's not any worse than your average foreign film dub.

Basically this movie is for action fans and fans of Hong Kong martial arts movies. It's an entertaining blend of science fiction, police drama, kung fu and of course superhero genres that make this an enjoyable popcorn movie. Granted it's not going to look polished for the average viewer, but if you like martial arts and cool superheroes I recommend The Black Mask.",1141862400,8,2373,4.7409200968523

1051286,3,6305604819,"""Black Mask"" is one of several Hong Kong action movies that immediately predates the Matrix trilogy, and influenced the trilogy on a superficial level. It stars Jet Li (who's done much better things) as a superpowered vigillante, and features lots of camera trickery and wirework. The characters tend to wear black trenchcoats, fight kung-fu in midair, and several important showdowns occur on rooftops in the rain (just like in ""The Matrix"")!

1051288,5,6305604819,"Sometimes I wonder why American studios even try to make action-packed martial arts thrillers; they just cannot compete with the great films churned out by Hong Kong studios.  Black Mask is an underappreciated, high octane, exhilarating motion picture.  How could it not be, as it combines the untouchable martial arts skills of Jet Li, the directorial genius the great Tsui Hark, the fight choreography of the renowned Yuen Woo Ping, the comparatively high Hong Kong budget of ten million dollars, and virtually nonstop action?  Granted, the film was given an audio makeover on its way to America, but the dubbing is very well done and the hip-hop soundtrack keeps your blood pumping even when no one is fighting.  This is not to say I would have preferred to see the film in its original format, with subtitles, but Black Mask delivers more bang for the buck than anything coming out of American studios.  Originally released in 1996 as Hak Hap, this movie made the jump to America three years later, just after Jet Li had made his American debut in Lethal Weapon IV.  The film does have a comic-book superhero feel to it, thanks largely to the Kato-like black mask the hero wears, but the storyline is actually quite impressive and easy to follow (although the master plan of the baddies seems a little out-there) .  Some reviewers don't seem to care for Black Mask, but I thought it was terrific.
Jet Li plays Michael, a former member of an elite, genetically enhanced fighting group known as the 701 Squad; after helping his fellow soldiers escape, he wants nothing more to do with killing.  Now adopting the name Simon, he is a mild-mannered librarian perfectly content with his new life.  Then the killings start.  Someone is offing all of the drug lords in Hong Kong, which doesn't necessarily sound like a bad thing, even to Simon's buddy Inspector ""Rock"" Sheck (Ching Wan Lau).  Still, the detective has to put an end to the carnage and becomes the lead man on the case.  Simon realizes that his old 701 Squad is carrying out the attacks, and he takes action in order to save his friend Rock.  No one else can stop these bad guys, so Simon dons a black mask to hide his identity, and starts laying the smacketh down from one side of the island to the other.
The action never stops, and Tsui Hark does more with ten million dollars than most filmmakers could do with ten times that amount.  I'm talking carnage, people - huge explosions, gunfire by the truckload, and incredibly wicked fighting - oftentimes in the most precarious of places.  At least half of the police force must get killed as this movie progresses, and the bad guys fare even worse; in one scene, the stiffs are stacked up one on top of the other.  Hark is a genius when it comes to presenting incredible action in the most unusual of ways and from the most unconventional of angles, and Jet Li is at his very best, exhibiting the smoothness and rapid-fire movements of the Wushu style he mastered long ago.  The supporting characters also bring a lot to the movie, from the delightful love interest Tracy Lee (Karen Mok) to genetically engineered superbabe Cailyn (Francoise Yip) to hard-nosed cop and all-around tough guy ""Rock"" to the super-evil Commander Hung (Kong Lung) (who, for reasons I can't explain, dresses like Ozzy Osbourne).

No. what let this film down were the appalling voice-overs. Why? For Gods sake Why? Karen Mok, who is my all time favorite actress speaks flawless, cultured English and yet her voice and those of the other actors are dubbed over by people who sound like 'chipmunks on speed', (for those who remember the cartoon chipmunks, alvin, simon & theodore).
Surely a film budget could stretch to allowing voice-overs by people who speak both languages fluently? God knows there's enough Cantonese who speak the Queens English and could have been trained to dub for cinema to cover those actors, such as Jet Li whose spoken English at the time of this film wasn't all that great!
I've seen it the once, it didn't cost me all that much, but I'll be honest, this was far from being Tsui Hark's best work and as much as I love Karen Mok, I won't watch this film again because it just isn't worthy of her.

The dubbing is truly terrible, I watch a lot of dubbed films, mainly italian horror, but this really stands out.

Instead the acting, story, plot, and everything else was far worse then even I expected, and I expected none.  The Phony fighting scenes could not be more obviouse if they used hand puppets.  Wen you see Jet Lee speed up to blur like speed, all the surrounding scenery also speeds up the same.  What an insult to our intelligence.

1051363,3,6305604819,"I have seen this in the theatre and on video.  I enjoyed the movie as long as I could force myself to not to listen to the soundtrack.
The movie is quite inventive and gory. If you enjoy a movie with interesting booby traps and unexpected ways for people to die, you will enjoy the film.  Jet Li plays a super soldier who risks his life to save the life of the rest of the super soldiers that the government plans to destroy now that they are no longer needed. After his escape, he settles down and becomes a librarian to escape his violent past.  Unfortunatly that all catches up with him and he takes on a disguise to fight a group commiting mayhem in the city. (Turns out to be his old friends.)
Jet Li is amazing in this film.  He is absolutly relazed and enjoying himself, even when doing the most amazing stunts that would cause permanent hernias for most people.
Now on to the bad part...  When the studio reissued this film, instead of sticking to the original soundtrack or going with something vaguely Chinese, they put in a heavy hip-hop/Rap soundtrack.  It is QUITE annoying.  Why Hollywood executive seem to insist on trying to mix black and chinese cultures whenever possible is beyond me. (Maybe they are thinking ""It is all non-white to me"" or something.)  I found that part of the film quite insulting.  They also supposedly cut about 15-20 minutes from the film.
I wish that they would release the original version of this movie on DVD.  I would really like to see the orignal in the original language and with the original music.",985305600,,1548,4.496428571428571

1051365,5,6305604819,"I own quite a few Jet Li movies on dvd, but this one is easily the best because of its ACTION, the sub plots, the library and the girl he likes, are necessary to this being a good film but aren't manditory to enjoying the film.  First of all the action sets itself apart from most action films that originated in Hong Kong, there are approximately 7 fight scenes and they are all done nicely.  Heres a summary of my favorite ones without giving away any plot keys:
-the first one is where jet li's character ( micheal ) escapes from the 701 base, most of it is guns and explosions but it sets the semi - violent tone for the rest of the movie and is entertaining.
-the bathroom scene, jet li doenst do much of anything here but his co star does and hes not all that bad. he beats up two thugs who try to mug jet li in the bathroom, its short but pretty cool
-this one is where black mask comes in for the first time, the 701 squad (basically the bad guys) start to shoot up a drug lords base that jet li's friend is currently investigating, this one has alot of shooting too but jet li drops off of a parachute and fights a guy in the rain and its the best fight scene in the movie
-this one is on a construction sight between jet and cailyn, the girl is a great martial artist herself and i also saw her in Romeo Must Die as the biker fighter.
- this one is a huge sequence against jet and his former commander and its great, it ranges from a sewer type base, to a gas filled room. it lasts about 5 mins, perfect for the final fight in a movie like this one.
Any Jet Li fan will definately enjoy this movie, action fans might have another opinion about it because movie goers accustomed stricly to big hollywood action movies ( The Matrix, Blade) will have a tough time digesting these hong kong fight movies, but its a great choice for anyone who likes action movies, period.",978393600,5,1877,4.153846153846154

There is no comparison. Black Mask is simply a better movie. The plot is more interesting and a lot less absurd and annoying, the movie is about the right length of time at around 90-105 minutes. they stuck to the action in this film and did it well. In Romeo Must Die, besides just a dumb story, The movie dragged too much in most places, failed to keep the viewers interest, and beat around the bush wasting valuable screen time. I don't know what foreign audiences are used to, but I would definately say that overall with American audiences especially, Black Mask just plain works better. The only gripe I have about the Black Mask DVD is that there is no original language track and/or subtitle options which would have been nice since the dubbing into English is way off.

And  yes, this is a B Film, no doubt about it -- but that is it's charm!  It is  camp.  It doesn't take itself seriously. It reminded me of the old Starman  films (Japanese imports) that I saw in the 70's, mixing the  horrific/demonic with the heart of gold heroics of manga.  Regardless of  the bad dubs (strikingly evident in the first scene), the actors are very  emotive, even if the script is lax on characterization.  This is a  superhero movie, and it lives up to one.

If you are not a Jet Li fan you may find this movie greatly entertaining, If you are a Jet Li fan you will  be nearly sick. There is one good fight scene and it is very short. If you  follow Jet Li movies you probably characterize him as some sort of super  being. It is quite amusing to see Jet Li preform acrobatic confrontations  against people weaker than him and several near equals in a film. In this  movie every opponent is a super being. Basically its Jet Li starting a  stunt only to be countered by a fifty year old man on wires. The mere sight  of a old man kick off a wall, fly twenty feet on wires to kick an immobile  Jet Li in the head made me wince.

Overall, the movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  The hip-hop soundtrack works a lot better than one would expect, and the  cheesy, badly acted dubbed dialogue is of the same type that you would  expect from a Godzilla movie.  The movie also has its share of twisted  violence and gore.  It's much cooler and more imaginative than that of The  Matrix or any run-of-the-mill Schwarzennegar movie.

The action  is fast and there are some trully great stunts going on here, but on the  other hand there is way too much gun play and wire stunts to keep the  action believable.

1051435,2,6305604819,"I have seen several of Jet Li's movies (I haven't seen Fist of Legend yet though I have heard that is one of the best martial arts films ever) and only one, The Bodyguard from Beijing, matches the heights of Jackie Chan's  great works such as Who am I? and First Strike.  Black Mask is not bad due  to some good action sequences but there a lot of aspects that weaken the  film.
As for the plot?  Well, Jet Li plays a librarian/ex-soldier named  Simon who wants to live a peaceful life.  His best friend, Rock, is a  police officer who gets involved in a case involving the murders of several  drug lords.  Simon discovers that his old squad, the 701, are responsible  and they plan on taking over the criminal underworld.  To prevent his  friend from getting hurt, Simon decides to take matters into his hand and  fight the 701 squad.  To prevent his identity from being discovered, he  wears a black mask over his face.
As I stated earlier, the movie has a  lot of serious problems.  For one thing, a budget of 10 million dollars for  a martial arts film is too much.  Black Mask is filled with one too many  cheesy explosions and laser blasts.
Jet Li is an incredible performer but  the film does him little justice.  He gets to show off some fancy moves,  particularly in the beginning, but the martial arts fights begin to look  rather jumbled, clumsy, and unrealistic toward the end.  Much different  from The Bodyguard from Beijing in which that film's martial arts fights  look genuine, fluid, and simply spectacular.  In Black Mask, Li is aided  too much with help of wires as it's clearly impossible for a person to jump  around like that.  It's way too distracting.
Then there's the musical  score.  Um, where is it?  All I here is a bunch of rap music, most  (virtually all of it actually) which is quite bad.  It's completely out of  tone with the rest of the movie and is once again another distracting  factor.
As for the acting, Li delivers yet another fine performance.  Ching Wan Lau is also good as Detective Rock.  The female performers don't  fare nearly as well.  Karen Mok is incessantly annoying while Francoise Yip  is seriously underused and leaves the movie way too quickly (then again,  the movie's not that long in the first place).
Jet Li has amazing moves,  but he really deserves a script equal to it.  For now, I'll settle with  The Bodyguard from Beijing (and hopefully Fist of Legend).",956016000,,2420,4.544392523364486

The script is no stranger than most, the casting is excellent and the action is phenomenal (especially the  warehouse/construction site brawl). The fatal flaw with this film is the  soundtrack, not the tpe of music, but the volume. It is so loud it  overpowers the sound effects and the pieces that have been chosen's  rhythyms don't mesh with the action on screen. It makes the fight sequences  feel out of sync. If the soundtrack is scrubbed and replaced with rap songs  with a more appropriate beat and mixed so that the sound effects could be  heard, I'd give this movie two more stars.",955584000,,702,4.69672131147541

The HK releases of the movie on the other hand have all the plot scenes but censored violence scenes at several points. This is at least in the original DVD from Mei Ah is missing several violent moments. The US version is also different from the International version released in other countries as it received a Hip Hop soundtrack. The US version is the version Amazon has primarily showing even to stream.

Recent releases out of Hong Kong on a Region 3 DVD and a Blu-Ray have restored the violence bits chopped out of the Mei Ah disc but again the DVD is region locked. Furthermore a Taiwanese version is also available that is rare, dubbed completely in Mandarin and not the Cantonese language of the original (all the language dubs are pretty much dub overs, there's really no original on set language dialogue choice here), this version features even more bits not featured in either the International or HK versions including more violence on the part of the movie as well as the censored bits off of the Mei Ah version. The quality though is rather sharp step down from the Region 3 DVD and the US version which look crisp, the Taiwanese version looks faded and has burnt in subs in English and Chinese.
The US international version is serviceable but yes is missing a lot of plot and dialogue scenes.  So the choice in buying versions is rather complicated as chances are the version you are buying is cut anyway you slice it, if you have a region free DVD player the region 3 DVD is good also. The Taiwanese version from Thundermedia is rather rare now and chances are you might find it on Ebay possibly but probably not.
