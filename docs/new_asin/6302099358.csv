The DVD I bought misses a very nice scene - girl on the balcony was cut down because of showing to much skin for the US version - this is to bad because it embezzles another great pointe of the movie.

421160,3,6302099358,This little film from the early seventies stars major film star Robert De niro in a role I'm sure even he can't remember doing along with george segal who plays JJ a sucsessful hairdresser who's hooked on heroerin and runs afoul of the mob. So JJ is up to his neck in trouble when the cops use him to get the goods on a drug smuggler. Absorbing at times very well acted By segal in this somewhat twisted comedy/drama Best scene is when JJ & His friend are shooting up in a washroom in an abandon office floor JJ'S friend overdoses on what he thinks is heroin but instead it's battery acid laced inside  the drug meant for JJ. A powerful scene displaying Segal at his efftictive moment in the film. A bittersweet film more regareded and appriciated today then it was first relased over twenty years ago.,985824000,7,802,4.418918918918919

421162,3,6302099358,"Born To Win is a black comedy that was released more than forty years ago about a life of a drug addict. The story revolves around Jay Jay,an ex-hairdresser who finds it difficult to support his drug addiction. He later reaches rock bottom as his lifestyle only leads him to more harm like self-hate and lack of self-confidence.

The movie obviously is pretty much dated as it belonged to the 70's when people are discovering the ""pleasure"" that drugs can bring and thus forming the habit. While it may serve as a warning to the viewer as it makes fun of the disaster that Jay Jay is headed to,it fails to provide genuine warning and does not manage to entertain the viewer at all.",1422662400,,681,4.491935483870968

421167,3,6302099358,"Segal was actually pretty decent as the never-ending-loser who, in addition to the chaos and despair that follows most junkies around anyway, gets his share of bad breaks along with 50 other people's bad luck on top. When you combine the stupidity and desperation that would cause an otherwise sane person to try to buy dope from some dealer he had robbed less than 24 hours before with a foolproof talent for being in exactly the wrong place at the wrong time, you get JJ.

However, there are many better movies about junkies and the heroin lifestyle,set in that time period. There's The Panic in Needle Park, one of Al Pacino's first leading roles. Sid and Nancy, about the last days and eventual deaths of Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols and his also-addicted, and usually raging, violent girlfriend Nancy Spungen. Drugstore Cowboy, starring Mat Dillon and Kelly Lynch is a true story about a crew of junkie thieves who support their habits by stealing from pharmacies throughout the Pacific Northwest.",1401753600,,1004,4.871345029239766

It also pulls no punches in regard to cops that are willing to break every rule to bust the big dealer.  You could argue for the cops that there weren't enough prison cells in the country in 1971 for every user.  You could argue against the cops that perhaps this particular big dealer refused to grease the right palms.  Like Cassavettes, this broke out of every conventional formula at that time, which makes up for the poor image and sound quality.",1383696000,,548,4.505050505050505

Billed as sixth banana in BORN TO WIN is a very young Robert De Niro.

It's the grim story of a loser who has this phrase tattooed on his arm. Hip hairdresser-turned-junkie JJ (Segal) is a not-too-adept thief, nor is he very smart. While delivering a stash of 'H' for a local dealer nicknamed 'Geek' (Elizondo), JJ instead decides to steal it. Cops nab him with the goods and undercover narc Danny (De Niro) forces him to set up a 'buy' with Geek.

While arranging the sting, JJ asks Geek for some smack. He's given poison and shares it with a friend who dies after shooting up, a moment which exemplies JJ's life. Despite that tattoo, this is a guy who CAN'T win, can't break even, nor can he get out of the game.

A funky soundtrack, plus humorous touches like Miss Black's encounter with JJ as he's stealing her car, or Segal prancing around the streets in a pink peignor after being stripped of his double-knit polyester threads, are stark contrast to a very depressing movie. It's the sort of anti-hero tale they don't make anymore (for obvious reasons).

421185,5,6302099358,"If you liked Drugstore Cowboy, filmed in '89 but set in '71, now you can see ""Born to Win"", filmed in '71 and nothing to do with '89.  Both were good junkie movies but for different reasons.  Be warned.. Born to Win starts off a little slow.. film quality, script and acting come off somewhat low-budget.  Don't be put off by this.  Instead, try to enjoy shots of a 1971 NYC and suspend judgement. Get past the first 15 minutes and your interest is liable to pick up.  I found it intriguing, by the first half hour, and continues to get better all the way until its killer ending. And the ending is really crafty and clever - and makes a brutal point.  This is the way movies should end - with such a knock-out punch that your brain is reeling from it even hours or days after seeing the movie.  This was the case for me, but I didn't come to it for the sake of Robert DeNiro's cameo appearance.  This movie is not about DeNiro, so don't come to it for that, or judge it based on his amount of screen time.  George Segal and Karen Black are the leads.. and they put in great performances once the movie gets going.  But it's the story, it's what happens in the story, that makes this movie so interesting.  And clever.  If you make it to the ending.  This is a really good movie, period, but will be even more enjoyable if you have some appreciation for where it was filmed and when it was made.",1203811200,5,1395,4.1992481203007515
421186,4,6302099358,"I was very surprised at the quality of this film.  The acting is solid and good, the story quite believable and unpredictable (i.e. not hollywood endingswith love winning, baddies falling, and whatever redemption needed is forthcoming), and there are many future stars in it as young actors.

JJ, just out of prison and a junkie with no life but some friends, meets Karen Black, who accepts him as he is with a wonderful chemistry of laughter and attraction. He has lost his family and there is plenty of regret through all the chemical highs.  JJ is always trying to score, and is basically a loser, about to lose again.  Black changes this to a degree, but the momentum of JJ's life is too strong for her and eventually brings her down.  Segal is entirely convincing, really better than I have ever seen him.

Recommended for the story and for film buffs.",1201478400,2,857,4.642384105960265
421187,3,6302099358,"[Keepers Home Video, Inc.]. A shot (apparently taken from a movie frame) of Mr. DeNiro adorns the VHS jacket and so we fans follow that lead. Yes, before Mean Streets, The Godfather II, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, and the rest, he had small roles in independent films. I'm no expert on that pahse of his career, but ""Born To Win"", starring George Segal and Karen Black is a *4* star entry: I've never seen Segal play such a textured and complex character so convincingly, you're made to feel like that proverbial fly-on-the-wall, or better put, that guy shadowing him, with a hidden camera, around the unofficial Times Square drug fair of 1971. He is cursed and blessed at the same time. He has a very serious drug problem *and* a strong mind - too bad he uses the later to negotiate the next fix. The cinematography for this presumptive low-budget drama is compelling; here is another minor classic in the documentary-style drama. Ivan Passer maintains the low-key mode throughout. An incredible scene involves Segal's ""working"" a worker at a Times Square establishment, so as to convince her he is there to remove the safe. A brilliantly executed scene. Robert DeNiro has about 10 minutes on screen as a Detective.
Karen Black, in her own *understated* way, conveys that sense of doom even while she revels in an unexpected, comforting, happy relationship.
""The Swap"" is less of a movie, even with the strong cast. (*2* stars). A struggling independent soft-core porn filmmaker is found dead and his Brother sets out to get the facts, while he adjusts to life as an ""ex-con"". DeNiro appears in some early scenes.",1196294400,,1616,4.816546762589928
421188,5,6302099358,"This movie is a classic.  OK, it has that semi-low budget feel in the beginning, and you may be wondering after the first 15 minutes if the movie is gonna be worth your time.  Keep going!  It fully redeems itself!  Besides, the shots of New York from that time period are part of what make the film interesting for us 35 years later.  That and the whole tone of the film.  Anyone who could even slightly appreciate films like Shaft, Foxy Brown or anything from the Soul Cinema collection, should have no trouble getting through the slightly cheesy opening of this film, and into the heart of what makes this movie great.  The five stars I give it are for the movie itself and not for DVD production.  False advertising aside (don't get it for the sake of DeNiro's cameo), this movie rocks!

p.s. I saw this movie on a European dvd (picture quality and everything was fine) before I ordered it from Lincoln Sound and Disc (soundndisc?) on Amazon - beware of this movie seller! First, the box you see on Amazon (Classic Collection - 1998) and the one you get are different (cover picture not the same). It's not in a standard dvd case (it's a cardboard box!), does not contain chapter stops, and there are spelling mistakes (even De Niro's name is spelt wrong). Finally, the sound quality sounds like it's coming over a bad radio.. can't understand a word. No response when I contacted them about this. I've read other reviews that complain of similar things with this movie (which is fully worth getting), but make sure you go with a seller you trust!",1192320000,9,1550,4.546762589928058

Born to Win is a little less downbeat than The Panic In Needle Park, which starred Al Pacino as a junkie.  The DVD box has Robert De Niro's image on the cover, and he's in the film several times for a few minutes, but George Segal is the star of this one.
