6283003,5,B00IO03I6Q,"Am I right OR Am i rilla!!!!!  Robert Duval is a National Treasure, one of a kind, brilliant actor who earns his way in every movie he is in.  He has subtle ways of making points which are his and his alone.  Like blowing out his breath to stop a moment of tears and then being able to speak.  I'd give him ten stars if I could.  From Mash to this film he has never let me down.  He cant make a bad movie period.",1401148800,57,412,3.788235294117647

6283008,5,B00IO03I6Q,"My wife and I are Robert Duvall fans and have rated numerous of his movies five stars.  That said, this movie is a perfect fit for Robert Duvall.  It is unrestrained good times with an edge, very much in the spirit of Lonesome Dove.  In contrast, though, this movie is more ""feel good"" and simply entertaining.  Angie Cepeda was excellent as the dark-haired Penny Wafer.  There is certainly an element of unbelievability, but put that aside and simply enjoy the fun times in old Mexico.  The movie is set on location in Brownsville, Texas, which is probably as close to old Mexico as it is safe to be.",1401062400,6,601,4.518518518518518

6283010,2,B00IO03I6Q,"As much as I adored Jeremy Irvine in his performance in ""Now Is Good"", I felt he was like a sore thumb sticking out everywhere in the film...the problem was that he couldn't shake himself off of the ""adorable English boy"" image and I saw ""Adam"" from Now Is Good except with an American accent.  The storyline only made sense until 30 minutes into the movie..and it just went into a silly goose chase...not a very exciting one either...",1400889600,2,435,4.506329113924051
6283011,4,B00IO03I6Q,"This isn't the best film ever made, and the plot is a bit outrageous, but it certainly is 100% Duvall.  He's cagey, tough, and poetic in his way of portraying the elegance and power of silence.  The way he tilts his head, the way his eyes nearly swell to the tears of heartbreak but stop because his inner fortitude will not allow it - are wonderful examples of artistic economy and effectiveness.  Duvall is one of our best actors, able to say more with an uplifted brow or a scowl than most actors delivering a soliloquy.  He portrays strength with his pauses, vulnerability with silence. This film, even with its shortcomings, exhibits Duvall's best qualities in miniature.  It's well worth a viewing.",1400889600,62,704,4.737704918032787

While watching it, I went to Rotten Tomatoes to check out the review (mostly negative), and I cannot understand why. This is not the All American Great Western, but it did have a decent story (grandfather connecting with his unknown grandson), decent action, and Mr. Duvall (of course). I debated giving it four stars, but decided on a more realization three stars as it was good, but not great; and certainly not awful.

6283036,4,B00IO03I6Q,"Firstly, it's a  Robert Duvall movie, so it's worth a look.  After reading a number of other reviews this is one of those movies you either love or hate.  Duvall's performance is everything you would expect it to be and does seem to overshadow the other cast members, but that's hard to avoid with a larger than life figure like Duvall.  The storyline is believable, although I was a bit disturbed about the suicide attempt at the beginning.  However, it makes sense and aptly demonstrates the depths of the character's desperation and despair over the loss of his land, livelihood, and independence as he sees a glimpse of an appealing future of confinement in a trailer park with nothing to look forward to, but being spoonfed oatmeal in a nursing home.  In true cowboy style, Bovie decides not to go quietly into the night, taking his grandson, that he'd just met, along for one last adventure across the border.  I think one thing that throws a lot of people off is that there are a ton of Mexican cultural nuances captured in the film related to the themes of life, death, family, and getting older.  It also highlights the glimmers of hope that exist in the midst of the gritty underbelly of Mexican border town life as portrayed by the singer/stripper Patty Wafers/Sugar Cookie played by Angie Cepeda. In addition to Duvall'sspot on cowboy persona, Cepeda is a physically captivating figure. She's the perfect combination of beauty, sensuality, and Latin sensibility mixed with a tough yet vulnerable, not to mention super hot exterior.  She is simply scintillating, plays her part well and isn't a half bad singer.  Gally, I can take him or leave him.  His occupying the third main character is necessary, but his performance was overall unimpressive, yet he brought a bit of comedic relief with his dopey storebought cowboy outfit and his ""pecker red cowboy boots."" Some reviewers got hung up on the repeated use of the ""F"" word, which did become predictable and tiresome.  And that along with the unapologetic exhibition of Ms. Cepeda's magnificent mammaries puts this solidly out of the realm of something you would watch with your kids.  Yet, somehow it all fits with the overall scope of the story.  I did agree that at the end it seems that Gally gets the short end of the deal when Bovie ends up with the hottie and whisks her away in the SUV of the dead bad guy, back to her hometown along with a bag full of cash.  It could happen...?  I guess it makes sense, the youthful and inexperienced Gally probably couldn't handle a woman like Patty Wafers anyway, so all's well that ends well.  In the closing scene, they part company, Bovie and Sugar Cookie to a new life together and Gally walking back across to Texas, to an uncertain future to resume his life, a little wiser with the memory of a wild night in old Mexico as evidenced by the bullet hole in his cowboy hat, that he has now earned the right to wear proudly.",1517961600,,2935,4.646034816247583

When he asks Red to stop along the road so he can urinate, Red takes off in his car while they are urinating, not realizing there is now $150,000 in the floor of the back seat.

Having stated this, some guys need to know when a part is not right for them at all and no matter that you produced it. Robert is way to old to play this part, he is doddering and just not right, him kicking in a door could never happen. The old codger thing doesn't fly at all. If anyone else would have done this part, it would have been better. I go actually 2.5 stars. And those stars go to the co-stars, Jeremy Levine and Angie Cepeda. They made do with what they had and even in spite of some odd dialog from duvall they managed. If you must see this wait til it is free. The idea of this man as the ""action"" hero is ludicrous.",1485043200,2,752,3.986754966887417

It's hard to even describe the depth and the mystery of this film, but it's about an old timer who can not face going gently into that good night.

I had high hopes for this Robert Duvall movie.  But this one bombed. Not even Duvall's talent could pull this story line out of the toilet.  Waste of money and time.

The topless singer and grandson's parts were neither believable, well acted or even humerous.

The killings/violence didn't fit either.  It was like the producer took bits and pieces and tried to stick them together to make a movie.  Only the pieces didn't fit or flow well to tell a decent story.

Duvall was cast in a similar style as in Second Hand Lions, but this movie lacked the charm and fun.

Rather than explore any connection between 3rd-world desperation and old gringos who come in with someone else's drug money, her character is written one-dimensionally as some kind of titty bar saint.

I usually find his stuff 'entertaining', but this seemed rather unpleasant to me. I think there was a Dylan Thomas (poem) quote at the beginning of the film, ""Do not go gentle into that good night..."" If that was to be foreshadowing, then it failed as there was nothing poetic or pleasant about what happened. Let's see: 5 drug related killings, a theft of money, a pseudo coming of age for Duval's grandson, mostly cardboard cut-out characters, Duvall as a not so likeable bull-headed old guy (who can still dance), and a plot that depends on violence to drive it (and as a character changer).

Duvall's character here is Red Bovie, a Texas rancher who's lost his spread to the bank and is now faced with living out his remaining life in a trailer park. Gus wouldn't have tolerated that, and Red doesn't either. Rather, he takes his stick-in-the-mud grandson Gally (Jeremy Irvine) in tow for a bit of fun below the border. Instead, they blunder into a drug deal gone bad and pick up a foul-mouthed stripper/singer named Patty Wafers (Angie Cepeda), who develops affection for the curmudgeonly but still game and feisty Bovie.

As Red and Gally head towards the border across Texas back roads, let's ignore the Joshua trees seen out the driver's side window  trees limited in range to the Mojave Desert in California, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. Let's ignore the palm trees lining the streets of the remarkably un-dusty and well-developed town just across the Rio Grande in (again presumably) north-central Mexico. My wife and I are virtually certain that Latin ambience was provided by Olivera Street in downtown Los Angeles. So much for authenticity of location.

Duvall's Augustus McRae was perhaps his greatest and most loved acting achievement. It set him up for several later roles, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broken-Trail/dp/B000IB9WX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broken Trail</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Range/dp/B0060CTH5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Range</a>, and this one. Perhaps fans of Duvall as Gus will find enough in A NIGHT IN OLD MEXICO to satisfy especially if, like me, they're older and mindful of old age's encroaching limitations and societal expectations. Otherwise the film is clumsy, unbelievable, and sometimes painful to watch. Besides Duvall, only Cepeda as Patty is worth the effort.

There's even an allusion to the maturation process of boy to man characterized by the type of hat he wears, seen awkwardly here with Gally and more skillfully with Newt Dobbs in LONESOME DOVE.

I don't write many reviews, but I read a lot of them. I am frankly surprised at the number of 1s and 2s and even 3s about this movie. Sure, there is a bit of ""language"" in the movie, but nothing like so many others. Are these critics void of the world we live in? It is a movie, which depicts a number of peoples lifestyles, in which their language might not be found at church, but would be found in most Jr. High schools among the students.

I Can remember that feeling many times when I was younger.  Sure Robert played Gus or whom ever; who cares you know what you are going to get with him in a movie these days, a superb bit of acting.  And the singer was great watching her get involved with these two nut jobs from across the border and end up falling  for the old guy made me think there is still hope in this world.

This is too bad because the wonderful actor, Robert Duval--who is truly great in this film--deserves better material.  I loved his miserable old South Texas rancher persona and I loved his building relationship with the young woman--a desperate woman needing love and respect and intelligent enough to see through the aged Duval's crusty exterior.

Along the way they pick up two hitchhikers which change the course of not only the night but their lives. The first thing I have to say about this movie is that Robert Duvall was the perfect choice. This is his Gran Torino in the way that this seemed like a movie where they turned on a camera and just filmed him being himself for a few days. He is the only real name in this but that does not diminish the movie at all. It started off a little slow but by the end I ended up liking it and was glad I stuck it out. There is drama, action and some comedy in this but the real reason to watch is Duvall. You really can't take your eyes off of him and his casting alone makes the movie better.

Don't waste your time feeding their anti Jesus demons and the trash they write.,1529971200,,459,4.666666666666667
8643764,5,B00IO03I6Q,"I just loved this movie! Lots of laughs and Robert Duvall was so funny as an old coot who wanted one last fling before he died.
He wasn't ready for the glue factory. And I liked the idea of an old man traveling with a young grandson who had yet to find his
own way in life.  The only thing I did not like was that they didn't show how the old man was doing a year after this movie ended
and he parted ways with his grandson.  I would like to know how both him, the grandson, and the pretty young girl were doing
in their happy afterlife.  And did he manage to buy a home or a small ranch in Mexico or find a good apt there and friends?",1529625600,,635,3.83206106870229
