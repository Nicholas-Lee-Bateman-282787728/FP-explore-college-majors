8054898,5,B00080C6DG,"On a day in May in 1909 the controversial clairvoyant Charles Webster Leadbeater (at the time one of the leading figures of the Theosophical Society) went for his daily walk along the beach near Adyar, India. Leadbeater spotted a boy whose beautiful aura was completely devoid of selfishness. Thus starts the amazing story of one of the most famous Eastern thinkers of the 20th Century, Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895-1986). He was groomed by the Theosophical Society to be the new World Teacher, a role he rejected in 1929. From that moment on this kind and gentle man travelled the world offering his message to mankind without doctrines, organizations or creeds. He influenced the lives of thousands, including Eric Clapton, Bruce Lee and Eckhart Tolle.

THE CHALLENGE OF CHANGE
The Challenge of Change starts out as a documentary about the fascinating life story of Krishnamurti from his birth until the moment he severed his ties to the Theosophical Society. This part takes up half an hour. The documentary material is presented extremely well using photographs and silent movies. This isn't a ""Discovery Channel"" documentary in which experts on the subject vent their opinions. Also, the documentary about Krishnamurti's life ends in 1929 and more or less suggests that he stopped developing from that point on (which I seriously doubt). The remaining 70 minutes form a compilation of Krishnamurti's talks. It must have been a hell of a job to select material from talks  by a man who was a prolific speaker for his entire adult life. It would be even more difficult to summarize his teachings in short. But the filmmakers succeeded.

THE EXTRAS
There's over one hour of bonus material on this DVD that includes: a documentary about the making of the Challenge of Change, information about the Krishnamurti Foundation and its headquarters, parts of interviews with friends and biographers with even a critical note here and there and, of course, more footage from Krishnamurti's talks.

CONCLUSION
Why did I give this DVD five stars despite some minor criticism? The sound and vision quality are both excellent. So is the camerawork. The footage of Krishnamurti is interspersed with beautiful shots of the natural world. The extras are very informative. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the life and teachings of Krishnamurti.",1147996800,8,2346,5.117493472584856
