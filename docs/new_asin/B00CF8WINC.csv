8581190,5,B00CF8WINC,Nice release - better than the CR my a long shot IMO,1408665600,,52,3.4166666666666665
8581191,5,B00CF8WINC,"Boardinghouse.  Ah, Boardinghouse.  If you're a Boardinghouse fan, this DVD will literally kill you.  It's that sick.  Too many extras to mention.  HOWEVER, if you're new to the Boardinghouse game, I strongly suggest starting with the shorter theatrical cut first (both the Director's Cut and the theatrical cut are included on the disc).  That's definitely best for the initiated.",1388102400,5,381,5.372881355932203
8581192,5,B00CF8WINC,"This movie was shot on broadcast video. It also may get incoherent at times, and I had to rewrite some of this because it caused me to make some errors when I first posted this review. Within the first 15 minutes we get a drowning, a hand caught in the kitchen sink's garbage disposal, a hanging suicide, some guts, and a quick topless scene in a pool. This fast-paced start does slow down a bit, and it does contain some dialogue later on that some may think is unnecessary. It has some filler that slows down the pace in some parts, but most of the film moves at a pretty good pace. The film doesn't have much atmosphere, suspense, or interesting scenery. It does, however, deliver the exploitation. There's some full frontal nudity in a shower scene when the phantom causes a hallucination that makes the shower walls bleed. A girl rises quickly from a tub fully nude, but you can't really see much full nudity in this scene. There's also some topless scenes, and Kalassu (I don't know if you want to count this as nudity) has a wet see-thru sequence when she gets out of the pool. The gore in the film is cheap with some scenes like a guy pulling his guts out from under his shirt, a woman's eyes bulging and falling out, and some other cheap gore scenes. However, none of the gore is over-the-top. What's most memorable about the film is some excellent soundtracks and the telekinesis killer because you usually only see hand motions from him or hear him make strange breath sounds when he kills. The acting is about what you'd expect and is pretty bad. The ending psychic battle with the ghost is laughable and memorable because of the atrocious acting. The directing may or may not be good or decent depending on your taste for cheap 80s trash flicks, and it does have some flaws. I think eliminating a little bit of filler in parts would've helped the movie.

Unless you want to count some stuff like a really brief shot that shows a premonition of some drops of blood spilling in the shower before the actual scene occurs when that nude woman is in the shower with those bleeding walls, then there's no added gore in the directors cut. When I was comparing the director's cut, I didn't notice any added nudity. I now compared it again, and I picked up a very minor extension of a tame sex scene on the beach. This is just a tame topless sex scene and many might not even notice that it was shortened slightly. Another thing I saw when I was comparing the director's cut again was an almost unnoticeable extension with the gore scene when that guy pulls out his guts from under his shirt; when he's laying dead on the floor, someone moves his body for about a second. The directors cut contains added scenes and dialogue that may be of interest to fans of the film because they may want to see as much of the movie as possible. I'm glad that I got to see the director's cut, but I thought it contained way too much unnecessary dialogue. The director's cut is simply overloaded with filler and is basically just for fans of the film who are wondering what it's like. All that filler makes the director's version way too slow; I couldn't even watch the entire director's cut in one sitting. During the Q and A with John and Kalassu extra feature, he says a lot of funny stuff was lost from the directors cut because of a flood. What was salvaged was put into the directors cut on this DVD, so the real director's cut would've been even longer. Some of the extras are good like the Boarding House photo gallery that shows stuff like VHS and DVD box arts and other pictures. The alternate ending extra has no added gore or nudity, and the music video's are cheap and corny but fun for those who like cheap 80s stuff; I thought the music videos are fun. That original intro extra is just some typing on the computer screen. The Lightstorm photo gallery basically consists of pictures relating to the directors old musical band, as well as some Boardinghouse related stuff and some box art for other DVDs from Slasher Video. The interviews and commentary may be of interest to some people. Basically, some of the extras I liked and some I didn't care for that much like the Phantom Demo Reel that just shows that ultra cheaply created phantom image from the movie moving and smeared on the screen while some of the film plays, but I'm glad they included all this stuff anyways. The picture quality is a big upgrade from the Code Red DVD release. You can really see what's going on now and everything looks much better. The sharpness, color, brightness and contrast look so much better than my old Code Red DVD. I enjoyed the movie a lot more. The chapter stops have no animation. The DVD menu screen has a small picture window in the middle with some animation and that great soundtrack plays.",1384560000,5,4795,4.48
