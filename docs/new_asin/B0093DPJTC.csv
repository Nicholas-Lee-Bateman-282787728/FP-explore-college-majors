Very well acted, great story, nice music score and I love watching this movie every April when I do my taxes....it makes me feel good.  The outfits and the car and the general converstations remind me what it was like in the 80s. :)",1524355200,,607,4.128205128205129
8535146,5,B0093DPJTC,"Being an appreciator of movies, I have many favorites.  It's challenging to do a short list. But if I had to grab one and run out of a burning house, this would be the one.  I caught it some time ago on a local television channel, which aired a feature called ""Movies With Meaning.""  It may have originated from Odyssey.  Mariette Hartley introduced the program with a psychologist.  At the end of the movie, they discussed it.  It was generally an insightful segment.  Isabel is a very attractive person to get to know.  Ms. Stapleton is effective in giving her to us, demonstrating her talent in a role so at variance from the obtuse Edith of ""All In the Family"" fame.

I watched this with my father, trying it out on him, ready to switch to something else should he protest - woman kind of picture, you know.  But he too was drawn to her, one smart lady in this.  He has a way of cracking on characters as you go along, and he did so with some of the others.  Betsy Palmer's Ellie came in for some wry commentary, and she was rather open to it.  The men also weren't spared, but after referring to Isabel as Clarabell at the beginning, that's all of that for her. She has attributes that elicit interest and respect.  It's not a high budget film with all the accoutrements of those, but the actors are experienced, with effective portrayals.  For character study and story quality, ""Isabel's Choice"" is one of those rare finds you come across from time to time.

The movie centers around a work-related transition that brings up personal considerations, which require a not-so-simple choice.  It is thoroughly enjoyable to share Isabel's processes, thinking along with her, yet stepping back to admire her searching and weighing what is before her.  She has a quality of character that puts all of herself into her life and relationships.  Yet, she's true to herself in the midst of her loyalty to those around her.  That's not easy to do.  You see it with her two bosses, co-workers and with her mother.  She loves and is loyal, but she does not compromise her own truth.  Sometimes it takes a while to arrive at that.  But once she identifies what is going on, then  where she is with it, she will not back down from that.  And she will step up and assert that with whomever is concerned, be they boss, mother, whomever.  It's part of her strength and essence as a person.  Her bosses are strong men, but they waffle to varying degrees at times.  She never does.  Though not perfect, she is perfectly true.  You could say that she's a consistent straight shooter.

It's one that you carry with you long after viewing.

Noticed after the Amazon format changes, this one comes up miss-titled.  It is not an episode of Amos & Andy, but is a television movie entitled ""Isabel's Choice.""  Hopefully, they will discover this and make the correction.",1351382400,4,2861,4.575936883629192
