6567708,5,B00MBNYMDU,"Everyone who watches sci-fi films...or has reached any level of cultural maturity has seen or is aware of Alien, followed by Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection. If you haven't, you should. Sigourney Weaver's breakout role in Alien is one of the most honest I've seen in sci-fi films. Briefly (like I said, I'm sure you've seen it) starship receives distress signal in space, they check it out, get into big trouble with an alien life form...that attaches itself to someone's face. Against Ripley's (Weavers) advice, the man reenters the ship where they try to remove the alien. It eventually comes off, after a cut spills acid blood through several levels of the spacecraft. The rest of the movie is a series of attempts to remove an alien life form that is like nothing anyone has ever encountered. They can't kill it. One of the first truly horrifying alien designs on the big screen, the creature's design has been a major influence on outer space movies ever since. If you haven't seen it, see it! If you have, watch it again. Loved it.",1464739200,,1044,4.7103825136612025

8671492,3,B00MBNYMDU,"An intergalactic oil freighter picks up a distress signal from a windswept alien planet where something in a weird leathery egg secreted in the bowels of a derelict spacecraft spells doom for the crew as it mutates through several violent stages development, This uniquely directed- photographed and designed combination of sci-fi hardware and horror movie scare  tactics is one of the scariest and most influential (if itself overly influenced by the likes of It! The Terror From Beyond Space-Planet Of The Vampires and Queen Of Blood)films of the 70s,The film is marred only by its unsympathetic characters and muddled motivations- both alien and otherwise,",1506816000,,659,5.336538461538462
