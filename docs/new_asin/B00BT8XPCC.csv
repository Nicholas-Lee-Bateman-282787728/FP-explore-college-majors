8573545,4,B00BT8XPCC,"German saxophonist Peter Brotzman is a titan of free jazz in Europe especially, but also around the world. As of now (June, 2013), he is touring the US with a long-time compatriot on trumpet, Cecil McBee. In this film, we find him in a big band arrangement, playing with musicians he knows well, such as Keven Vandermark and Mats Gustovsen on reeds. Mr. Brotzmann plays alto saxophone, bass saxophone, and clarinet.

The pieces have some structure, but are quite free form, depending on unwritten teamwork and surprise. Mr. Brotzman ends one piece by looking at the orchestra and jumping up. When he hits the floor, the piece is over! It is all quite exciting, if challenging. No one is reading music.

The size of the group varies from thirteen to about ten, featuring a core of two drummers, acoustic bass, bowed and plucked cello (and four string electric guitar), tuba, two trombones, a pocket trumpet,three other reeds, and Mr. Brotzmann. There are no keyboards. I may have left someone out! The assembly is jointed on each piece with a special Japanese guest: electric trumpet, alto saxophone, koyota player (an acoustic Jananese stringed instrument), and electric guitar (as I have never heard or seen it before).

The film has no special effects. It begins with the musicians assembling, then features each number. It ends with the musicians walking off stage until the stage door is shut. This simplicity is refreshing; there is no need for anything but the music. My one complaint is that Mr. Brotzmann, the leader and most well-known of the musicians, is often out of the scene. This is odd. The pieces in general would have benefited by more of his playing as well. The recording was a bit uneven, since some instruments were difficult to pick up. However, I did not listen through headphones or on a very good sound system.

All in all, affectionados of Mr. Brotzmann (as I am) and free jazz in general will find this music satisfying and, at times, electrifying. Others may just want to experiment by beholding this display of human creativity.",1370995200,3,2058,4.854700854700854
