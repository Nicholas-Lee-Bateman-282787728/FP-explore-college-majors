3131271,5,B0014E95Q6,"If you are a lover of corny Sci-fi films, then this one is right up your alley.  Don't let the slow paced, lack of vulgar language, gore and professional costumes and make-up fool you.  This is a very enjoyable movie made to mimick the 1950s black and white genre films. In fact it's in black and white along with all the speckles and age produced anomolies old films are famous for having.  I loved it immensely.
  It starts out with a Scientist and his wife going on an expidition to search out a meteorite named Atmospherium.  They end up in a lodge, somewhere in the woods, that just happens to be unoccupied, complete with a gas stove and all the amenities for a Suzy Homemaker-type wife who whips up great meals in minutes out of thin air.  They are visited by a very articulate space allien couple, who happen to be wandering around in the same woods looking for,..... you guessed it, the meteorite, Atmospherium to power up their spaceship so they can go back home.  There are a few others like a Forest Ranger who drops by to warn the folks in the cabin about a grusome murder which took place not far from them, and an angry fellow scientist who happens to be looking for that same meteorite.  Yes there is an alien monster and yes there is a skeleton who strangely enough, reminded me of Plankton from Spongebob Squarepants (even sounds a lot like him too...).  He too wanted to, you guessed it again,......rule the world, by subliminally controlling the minds of the above mentioned characters into doing his bidding.  There is another character whom I really liked.  Her name is Animalia.  She was created from four woodland creatures by the angry scientist using a,....yes, once again, you guessed it, a ray gun........ In my opinion, she stole the show.  There's just too much going on in this movie to mention everything.
  It is a low key and non-life threatening movie (like the Sci-fi films of today).  You walk away with either one of two feelings.  Either you liked it or you wonder how you could have just wasted 89 mins. of your life you'll never get back.....  I recommend this and it's sequel, ""The Lost Skeleton Returns Again"",  to anyone who has a penchant for old films, (even though it was made in 2004....).
  There is a rather lengthy Q & A which provides a good deal of information of how this film was contrived.  I would never have heard of this film had I not been channel surfing one day out of sheer boredom, and I am certainly glad I did.  I would not have had the opportunity to learn about Larry Blamire and his production crew otherwise.  He has a gift for making cheesy, corny movies such as these.  Very funny indeed.  My hat's off to them.",1358208000,2,2683,4.50103519668737

3131273,5,B0014E95Q6,"If you like campy movies, this opus magnus should be at the top of your must-view list.  The 1950s and 1960s sci-fi movie makers gave the writers and producers of Lost Skeleton a lot of good material to work with, and nothing was wasted on them.  The movie is hilarious . . . to those who ""get it.""  If you hear a knock on the door during a dinner party, be careful -- it could be a mutant!",1315526400,,390,3.9743589743589745
3131274,4,B0014E95Q6,"Corny, pretentious dialogue. Hokey special effects. Stereotypical characters. Inept pseudo-science. A lame plot full of holes.

So why even bother watching ""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra""? Well, to start with, there's the fact that it's not a hokey sci-fi movie, but a clever, hilarious spoof of those old cheap movies made in the 1950s. It's gloriously pompous and idiotic, with some of the best/worst dialogue outside a Christopher Guest mockumentary. (""Why shake when we can touch other things... like lips."")

Scientist Paul Armstrong (Larry Blamire) and ""scientist's wife"" Betty (Fay Masterson) arrive at a rural area, looking for an asteroid made out of (I am NOT making this up) ""atmosphereum."" Little do they realize that evil Roger Fleming (Brian Howe) has found the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, which needs atmosphereum to move, and subsequently conquer the world, yada yada.

To make matters worse, a pair of aliens have landed. Not only do they ALSO need atmosphereum, but they have let a lethal Mutant loose on the countryside. Both the aliens and Roger manage to infiltrate the Armstrong cabin to find atmosphereum. Now Betty and Paul must befriend the aliens, and stop the evil Skeleton and the killer Mutant.

The entire movie is mockingly affectionate of those old sci-fi movies -- it's even filmed in the same location as most of them. The costumes are cheap, the aliens are cheesy, and very few of the events make any logical sense. When the Armstrongs and aliens sit in a spaceship and drink ""cranberroid"" juice from decorative candleholders, the goofiness is officially complete.

Admittedly, the plot does slow down to a crawl in the middle, and seems to temporarily lose its way. But fortunately it's peppered with high-school special effects (check out the skeleton climbing down the rocks), ridiculous props (spot the caulk gun), and the giant fish-faced Mutant, who falls for the Earth girl. It's practically a checklist for old cliches.

And then there's the horrible dialogue. One clunky gem: ""It is different, this 'Earth' as it is called. But then are we of the planet Marva -- as we call our planet -- not also strange and different to think planet and its people also?"" The best plot twist would have to be the ""Bride of the Lost Skeleton"" scenes, which would have made a great title for the movie.

Director/writer/actor Larry Blamire is wonderfully emotionless as Paul, saying lines like ""Betty, you know what this meteor could mean to science. It could mean actual advances in the field of science!"" with a straight face. I certainly couldn't. He's solidly backed up by a cooing Fay Masterson, intentionally wooden Andrew Parks, and a goofily seductive Jennifer Blaire.

Made on a shoestring budget, with terrible effects and costumes and a clunky script, ""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" is a delicious little spoof. And don't forget the sequel, in which the Lost Skeleton returns again!",1315267200,,2909,5.045833333333333

3131300,5,B0014E95Q6,"Ah, the cinematic masterpiece that is ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra!""

What to compare this movie to? Well, that is a great question. ""I hear it is a spoof!"" Yes, but not your traditional spoof. It is not what you would expect with ""Airplane!"" and its spoof of the Airport and disaster movies of the 70s, where jokes fly a mile per minute. No, this is an homage spoof of a movie filmed and acted EXACTLY like what you would expect to see in a 50's B-Movie like ""King Dinosaur (1955).""

Filmed in Black & White, full of intentional padding and repetitive dialog (Example ""As a scientists wife--the wife of a scientist.."") and full of the leaps of logic you would expect from a 50's bad sci fi movie (Well, they are aliens...of course they won't understand what stairs are, which leads to such dialog golden nuggets like, ""Look, a series of small buildings,  leading up to the main one...""), the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra is an homage to movies so bad you cannot believe someone hadn't thought of it before.

The movie is intentionally bad but you kinda don't have confirmation of that until about 15 minutes in.

Unfortunately they try way too hard at this spoofing thing and it comes out ridiculously unfunny. However I am a brave soul so I went through the whole movie waiting for that little piece of redeeming social value. I even sat on my hands so I would not press the fast forward button.

They did include many of the proper characters such as Paul the scientist and Betty wife of scientist. Then there is the infamous Dr. Roger Fleming the mad scientist. Toss in aliens, a mutant, and a mysterious girl that know how to act with her tongue.

While most of the things that we here are clichs and purposely stilted dialogue every once in a while we catch a line from a famous movie.

3365770,5,B0014E95Q6,"If you like campy movies, this opus magnus should be at the top of your must-view list.  The 1950s and 1960s sci-fi movie makers gave the writers and producers of Lost Skeleton a lot of good material to work with, and nothing was wasted on them.  The movie is hilarious . . . to those who ""get it.""  If you hear a knock on the door during a dinner party, be careful -- it could be a mutant!",1315526400,,390,3.9743589743589745
3365771,4,B0014E95Q6,"Corny, pretentious dialogue. Hokey special effects. Stereotypical characters. Inept pseudo-science. A lame plot full of holes.

So why even bother watching ""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra""? Well, to start with, there's the fact that it's not a hokey sci-fi movie, but a clever, hilarious spoof of those old cheap movies made in the 1950s. It's gloriously pompous and idiotic, with some of the best/worst dialogue outside a Christopher Guest mockumentary. (""Why shake when we can touch other things... like lips."")

Scientist Paul Armstrong (Larry Blamire) and ""scientist's wife"" Betty (Fay Masterson) arrive at a rural area, looking for an asteroid made out of (I am NOT making this up) ""atmosphereum."" Little do they realize that evil Roger Fleming (Brian Howe) has found the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, which needs atmosphereum to move, and subsequently conquer the world, yada yada.

To make matters worse, a pair of aliens have landed. Not only do they ALSO need atmosphereum, but they have let a lethal Mutant loose on the countryside. Both the aliens and Roger manage to infiltrate the Armstrong cabin to find atmosphereum. Now Betty and Paul must befriend the aliens, and stop the evil Skeleton and the killer Mutant.

The entire movie is mockingly affectionate of those old sci-fi movies -- it's even filmed in the same location as most of them. The costumes are cheap, the aliens are cheesy, and very few of the events make any logical sense. When the Armstrongs and aliens sit in a spaceship and drink ""cranberroid"" juice from decorative candleholders, the goofiness is officially complete.

Admittedly, the plot does slow down to a crawl in the middle, and seems to temporarily lose its way. But fortunately it's peppered with high-school special effects (check out the skeleton climbing down the rocks), ridiculous props (spot the caulk gun), and the giant fish-faced Mutant, who falls for the Earth girl. It's practically a checklist for old cliches.

And then there's the horrible dialogue. One clunky gem: ""It is different, this 'Earth' as it is called. But then are we of the planet Marva -- as we call our planet -- not also strange and different to think planet and its people also?"" The best plot twist would have to be the ""Bride of the Lost Skeleton"" scenes, which would have made a great title for the movie.

Director/writer/actor Larry Blamire is wonderfully emotionless as Paul, saying lines like ""Betty, you know what this meteor could mean to science. It could mean actual advances in the field of science!"" with a straight face. I certainly couldn't. He's solidly backed up by a cooing Fay Masterson, intentionally wooden Andrew Parks, and a goofily seductive Jennifer Blaire.

Made on a shoestring budget, with terrible effects and costumes and a clunky script, ""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" is a delicious little spoof. And don't forget the sequel, in which the Lost Skeleton returns again!",1315267200,,2909,5.045833333333333

Filmed in Black & White, full of intentional padding and repetitive dialog (Example ""As a scientists wife--the wife of a scientist.."") and full of the leaps of logic you would expect from a 50's bad sci fi movie (Well, they are aliens...of course they won't understand what stairs are, which leads to such dialog golden nuggets like, ""Look, a series of small buildings,  leading up to the main one...""), the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra is an homage to movies so bad you cannot believe someone hadn't thought of it before.

Having seen this wonderfully campy film several years ago, I mentioned to my friend and fellow author, Ted Rypel, that I wanted to see it again. So he bought me a copy and had it sent to me. This is a highly-enjoyable film, a nostalgic romp back in time for those of us who grew up on films like this -- except those films were unintentionally funny. This film has every intention of making you laugh and smile. Larry Blamire's silly and brilliantly funny spoof of those old, black-and-white sci-fi films of the 1950s and early 1960s is even better the second time around. Two scientists, one more dim-witted than the other, are searching for a meteor that contains the most valuable ""mineral"" in the universe: atmospherium. Professor Armstrong, one of the scientists played by Larry Blamire himself, does ""science things."" His wife is the perfect 1950s housewife, and not too bright herself. ""I know it's hard being a scientist's wife, being the wife of scientist,"" he tells her at one point. The aliens from the planet Mavra are also in need of the atmospherium to repair their damaged spaceship, which looks as if it was made by a 10 year-old kid out of tin foil and an empty paper towel role. Both aliens are as dumb and as strange as you can get, and they drink cherry wine out of candle holders! One scientist uses the aliens' caulk-gun gizmo to turn four forest creatures into a sexy but very bizarre human woman who likes to dance to rock and roll music. The mutant is the funniest looking and most hilariously conceived creature since those old Italian ""pepla"" films. The lost skeleton itself is held together by wires and manipulated with strings that are all too clearly visible. He's a wise-cracking skeleton straight out of vaudeville. Every time the skeleton appeared on screen I kept expecting him to use that old Three Stooges' gag: ""Greetings, gents! My name is Red!"" But Blamire is too clever a filmmaker to borrow a bit from another source. With quotable dialogue that is far from cliched and you won't see coming, with the cheesiest special FX since Ed Wood picked up a camera, with a silliness that is highly contagious, and with cinematography that captures to perfection those classic B and C movies, this one is in a class of its own. Great cast headed, too, who surely had a ball making this film. If you loved ""Young Frankenstein,"" you're really gonna love ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.""
