In my opinion this was like watching Kickboxer if it were a made for T.V. movie for the womens entertainment channel. you have to sit through seventy minutes of soap opera story and laughably horrible ""acting"" thorugh emotions of a man who can't act. Lets just say Gary Busy is the most SERIOUS actor in this film. that should say enough. Until finally, in minutes 110-115 there is a really badly corriographed fight scene. Think if your students tried to stage a fight for film. You can obviously see in this film there is no contact in punches/ kicks, and the jui jitsu is really planned out looking and un-natural. I warned you not to watch this! Dont waste your time. I recommend sitting in front of your favourite Bruce Lee film you haven't seen for 14 months instead, or atleast something in the B category like Bloodsport. But if that is the case, I rate Beyond the ring a letter C or D, and will honestly say it is Beyond the worst film I have seen in 2007.

Actors who should have been better weren't.  The father, living in America, but originally Spanish speaking from south America, delivered lines as a Spanish speaker speaking English would say them.

3017815,2,B000Y9Q59M,"A fairly recent entry into the autobiographical martial arts subgenre is 2008's ""Beyond the Ring,"" the supposedly true story of martial artist Andre Lima's attempt to raise money for his child's operation via underground prizefighting. It's a decent-looking low-budget movie with some definite heart to it, but it kind of forgets that it's supposed to be an action movie at times, and its production is questionable. Not much more to say, but I'll do my best regardless.

The story: tae kwon do/karate/jiu-jitsu master Andre (Lima) is stricken when he learns of his daughter's malignant brain tumor. When his insurance refuses to cover the cost of an operation, he turns to his two-faced manager (Gary Busey,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lethal-Weapon/dp/0790729695/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lethal Weapon</a>) who agrees to secure him an all-or-nothing match against a rising underground champion.

As a martial artist, Lima is definitely above average: he throws great kicks, is capable of some acrobatic stuff, and even manages to make ground fighting fun to watch. Prior to this flick, he solely played henchmen characters and supporting villains, most notably in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunland-Heat/dp/B0009WIEMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunland Heat</a>. I can't help but think that he should have stayed where he was, because as a lead actor, Lima is particularly bad. At his best, he makes Van Damme looks like a serious dramatist, and at his worst, he comes across as the bald brother of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tommy-Wiseau/dp/B000CFYAMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tommy Wiseau</a>. Luckily, Gary Busey is solid in a supporting role that's slightly deeper than first meets the eye, and Martin Kove (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Karate-Kid/dp/B0008JIJ2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Karate Kid</a>) is equally serviceable in a non-martial role (jeez, when was the last time he ever had a fight scene?). The script also tends to do what's expected of it and effectively conveys the pressure Lima is under, but also forces a few too many awkward dramatic scenes (i.e. the spaghetti dinner) as well as handful of unnecessary flashbacks.

The action content is alright, but there's definitely not enough of it. In 86 minutes, there are three sparring scenes and only one genuine fight, pitting Lima against ""American Gladiator""-turned-kickboxer Justice Smith. Most of the sparring scenes are too short to consider, so this all-important finale carries a lot of expectation. Does it make up for the deficiency of action in the rest of the film? No, but for what it's worth, it's not a bad fight. Action director J. J. Perry (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-II-Last-Man-Standing/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed II - Last Man Standing</a>) suffers from inconsistency like few others, but this brawl is one of his better offerings, if only because its six-minute length gives it the chance for a good back-and-forth rhythm. There are some surprising grabs and throws to be seen, as well as some good cinematic camera angles. It definitely made me want to see more of at least Lima in action. It's not the best fight ever, but a few more like it would have bolstered this one's rating.

The filming quality here is about average - not looking like it was shot with a home video camera but still undeniably of DTV quality. The entire production seems to have been edited on an iMac computer, which can't help but give it kind of a cheap feel. In the end, that shouldn't be what cinches your decision to watch this, but it doesn't do the picture any favors. Cumulatively, the movie falls way short of its surprising potential, but because most folks probably won't assume this one has any potential to begin with, it oughtn't be too disappointing for most viewers. Again, Andre Lima's definitely a good guy in the world of kicks and punches, but because he spends so little time supplying either and so much time giving an awful dramatic performance, I'm almost wishing never to see him again.

The acting is what is expected in a B-Grade movie...not that crash hot but the fight scenes are cool and some demonstrations performed by Lima make up for the lack of serious acting. Martin Kove and Gary Busy were the two best actors in the film.

What I liked most about Beyond The Ring is the storyline and the realism involved. Not so much realistic fight scenes but you can see that our hero (the main character) is only human and not a one man army who can bash up 10 people at a time.

I recommend Beyond The Ring to anyone who is a martial arts movie fan like myself but everyone has different taste. I hope those who don't take these kind of movies too seriously can sit down and enjoy watching this.",1221436800,,844,4.26875
