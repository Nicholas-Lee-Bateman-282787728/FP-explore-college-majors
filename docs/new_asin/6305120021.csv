970381,5,6305120021,pretty good tv movie. It goes great with Maximum Overdrive. You must own both movies not just one or the other. The ending has a twist too. But you'll see. great horror movie for a great price.,1496534400,,193,4.243243243243243

970385,5,6305120021,"Trucks mysteriously develop their own murderous minds and try to kill innocent people in a small town. I like the part where the cute, little, but murderous, RC dump truck broke out of the toy store and kill the mailman. I like the part where a trucker gets trapped by his own truck and then it drives off. I like the part where the hazmat workers where murdered by their own suit, and then the truck drives away with one of the workers in the driver seat. I like how the trucks move their sideview mirrors to look at people. And e trucks also communicated by honking their horns, turning on their blinkers, headlights, and windshield wipers. But if there was a movie where all vehicles came to life (like another reviewer said) and more murder scenes, then that would be PURE AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!!! :D :D :D",1488067200,,806,4.527397260273973
970386,3,6305120021,"It's okay, although had they gotten more into the reason behind the murderous trucks (they alluded to intelligence) it would have been more interesting. Some scenes made no sense, like the hazmat guys or even the chemical truck explosion, since they were never explained. The toy truck rampage was interesting but just dumb, and added nothing as well. The ending indicated there was a reason behind what was happening, but of course the movie itself didn't talk about it.

Ironically, this COULD happen given IoT and self driving trucks are becoming a reality. Just takes one hacker to make this movie come true.",1487894400,,612,4.941747572815534
970387,3,6305120021,"One of TWO movies inspired by Stephen King's short story. In this various trucks come to life, kill their drivers and terrorize locals and tourists in a small community. Even a cute, little toy dump truck manages to kill the postman. In Maximum Overdrive (the second movie) a comet passes extremely close to the earth causing all electronic devices to go nuts sending a number of semi trucks on a murderous rampage; cause and effect. In Trucks the cause is unclear but, possibly linked to a chemical spill mentioned in the news broadcasts; ? and effect. In both the trucks exhibit a level of intelligence and communicate with each other making each move they make deliberate. Having read the original story; both movies are up-to-par as far as the basic plot but, Maximum Overdrive is the better of the two because it makes more sense. In short...

970529,3,6305120021,"I watched this movie last night and my only complaint is that there isn't really any character building. Its a fun movie but there isn't a lot of of emphasis on the story or the characters. If you ask me the production company probably stood on the side of the street and asked anyone they could if they'd like to act in a movie. My reasoning behind this consensus is that these actors/actresses cannot act for their lives. Even the horror flick ""teeth"" has better character development, and plot development and that movie doesn't really have a lot of story to work with. So, this is one of those movies that you cannot expect too much from. Its basically the same movie as ""Maximum Overdrive"" the only difference is that this was more of a short story in comparison to ""Maximum Overdrive"".",1485388800,,791,4.577464788732394

I was driving a '58 Plymouth Fury when I was suddenly and viciously attacked by a Plymouth Road Runner for no apparent reason. I lost my pristine Fury, and nearly my life, before the assault finally ended. It turns out a band of rogue men in black had forced the Road Runner to watch the movie ""Christene"" 24/7 for 6 months which caused the car to develop a burning hatred of all Plymouth Furies. The rogue car managed to crush all the M.I.B. and escape, which led to my night of misery. I now drive a Datsun Honey Bee.",1484352000,2,614,4.256410256410256

Poorly scripted
Poorly directed
Poorly shot
Poorly Edited.

They give the movie away from the very start without drawing in the audience and creating any mystery at all. BIG MISTAKE! After that, you already know what's happening, and each scene is poorly shot, bad scripting and bad acting. It's not as bad as some ""B"" grade movies, but it's but there's just no excuse for putting movies out like this regardless of budget. So much could have been done in editing that could have helped save this movie.
The side stories are as shallow as the characters which doesn't leave anything left to enjoy.

I like how on both movies the trucks always demanded more fuel. It seems like if this were to ever happen we'd have an instant answer on how to appease the trucks. One thing that bugged me about Trucks was what became of the operator trapped in the trailer and what happened to the girls father? How come she was the only one on the Helicopter? Did the helicopter kill him? And was that the helicopter actually talking to them at the end or was that just a menacing taunting implying that help will never come like any other movie ending which implies no hope? I would like to see a modern remake of either of those 2 movies being enough time has passed for their to be one, but this time I would like an end that doesn't leave so many questions and imply has a to the point ending not implications like the end of Trucks or Maximum Overdrive where the ending titles imply that the survivors have permanently settled on the island to avoid trucks.",1438905600,,1169,4.416666666666667

971445,2,6305120021,"For those of you who were disappointed in the Stephen King directed ""Maximum Overdrive"", here is a second attempt at King's ""Night Shift"" short story ""Trucks"".

While the storyline is similar to the short story, I was kind of surprised at just how little ""Trucks"" the movie took from ""Trucks"" the short story? I'm sure almost every decision made was due to budget...or complete lack of budget. But I really expected this film to hone close to the written story for some reason.

As the movie opens we see a truck come alive in a desert junkyard and kill it's owner. The truck then moves to the edge of the highway and parks. Down the road we meet a small group of people at a diner/campground/truck stop facility. We learn that the area is close to Area 51, and the campground specializes in hikes to purported alien encounter sites. We also meet our heroes and heroine...to be honest they are pretty forgettable, and I can't remember a single character name.  We see that a couple more trucks spring to life, and kill their owners, one carrying toxic chemicals explodes creating a toxic cloud and cutting the diner/truck stop off from help. Before long the 4 living trucks have surrounded the truck stop and are holding the people inside hostage.

Talk about a shoe-string budget, in total I think there are 6 trucks that come alive here...well 7 if you count the Tonka Toy Truck that a mailman encounters (not kidding...and it's the best scene in the film). After watching ""Maximum Overdrive"" and seeing everything from push mowers to electric knives come alive...a couple of trucks seems pretty tame. There is no sense of danger or tension to the film, and the acting is pretty lousy. Not in a so-bad-it's-good way, just in a boring...how much longer?...kind of way. There are a few chuckles here and there, but really not worth it.",1404086400,,1835,4.707165109034268

While OVERDRIVE went full-throttle into cheeeze-town, TRUCKS attempts to be more of a straight-forward horror movie. Does it succeed? Sort of. The driver-less vehicles themselves are fairly menacing. The human characters are divided into the typical categories of resourceful heroes or hillbilly truck fodder. My favorite scene is when the mailman is pulverized by the toy, RC dump-truck!

Oh the whole, this film lacked a compelling lead actor (anyone instead of Timothy Busfield), a better lead actress, a less shrill girl in distress, a happier hippy, more suspense, and an ending that was less ironic.  As with Maximum Overdrive, speculation on the crazed trucks runs along the same lines: it was either Area 51 (aliens) or some comet.

Personally I do agree with other reviews that Maximum Overdrive is a better film due to better death sequences, more murderous vehicles, and ACDC songs mixed into the film but, Trucks had its own unique characteristics. For example, you had that deadly dump truck toy which killed a moronic mailman, the hazmat suit with an axe, poisonous gas that was caused by a truck, and the helicopter at the end of the movie which had a sort of a cliffhanger due to the question on what happened to the teenage girl's father and why she was on the helicopter in the first place.

At the end of this very short review, I will advise the way to cripple and stop rampaging killer trucks.

""Trucks"" is actually a 1998 remake of a 1986 movie ""Maximum Overdrive"". Both are based on a Stephen King novella and in fact, the 1986 ""Max"" was written, produced and directed by Stephen King himself. He called it a ""moron"" movie and I guess I will have to take his word for it, although I'm not sure if he was talking about the movie going audience or himself.  The movie was highly ridiculed but is actually highway miles above the remake. And the pace and ""roadkills"" of the original sped along while the pace for ""Trucks"" is comparable to an arthritic senior citizen on a walker.  And worst of all there are no characters in this movie you even care about so who can care about their fates?  The sole reason for my overly generous 2 star rating? The mailman versus the toy truck.  Thinking about it you realize how ridiculous it is but the movie sort of made it plausible and I liked the ending despite the fact it was directed and filmed without the proper timing and shock it should have had.

As promised I will now reveal the way to impede or stop a rampaging killer truck.

There's a spill that happens around the city but how that affects trucks to start to killing people I'm not sure. Plus they start doing this before the spill happens in the movie. So yea...Timothy Busfield and Brendan Fletcher are the only people I recognize in this film.

And no THIS IS NOT EVEN remotely based on the Stephen King short story, I have read it. The short story was way better than this, well I can't even write it out respect to Amazon and folks on here.

The movie lacks a useable plot and meanders to a very stupid ending with a talking helicopter. I thought this was about murderous machines not the freakin' TRANSFORMERS. I never get to see this infamous Toy truck scene with the mailman though I hear it's hilarous, I think it's gets edited by SciFi or I'm too bored to look at the screen the last two times it aired.

And that was Timothy Busfield in the film? I could have sworn it was John Ritter. Yup it was, I had to check IMDB for that, it's hard to tell them apart in my mind. At best avoid this movie at all cost! Put on a radiation suit to dump it in the trash if it shows up at your door, then contact HAZMAT to haul it away to safe location in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This film belongs in Chernobyl, buried and lost like a burnt out reactor.

971832,2,6305120021,"Trucks (Chris Thomson, 1997)

There is a school of thought, and one to which I subscribe completely, that states that if you're going to remake a movie, remake a bad movie. After all, there are any number of flicks out there with great ideas and terrible execution. Why bother remaking good-to-great movies when there's so much grist to work with that's justifiably obscure? However, the folks who decided to have another go at Stephen King's short story ""Trucks,"" the basis for the execrable eighties horror flick Maximum Overdrive, neglected one small part of the philosophy-- that one should try to make a movie that was better than the original piece of crap. I mean, come on-- the tagline for the movie is ""U-Turn, U-Die!"". You know you're not going to be seeing a Welles film here.

The paper-thin plot revolves around trucks that start driving themselves and trap a small group of humans in a truck stop. Well, that's the original story, anyway. King is one of the masters of taking a paper-thin plot and turning it into a creepily effective story, but Brian Taggert (also responsible for such immortal fare as Poltergeist III and the 1991 TV remake of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?) figured that wasn't enough for a feature-length made-for-TV movie. And, you know, maybe he's right; after all, Maximum Overdrive was far more faithful to the story and still came out smelling like horse manure. So he added some backstories, a couple of romantic subplots, that sort of thing. All of which would have been well and good if any of them had actually gone anywhere.

Surprisingly, the acting here is not bad. The cast is headed by TV stalwart Timothy Busfield (The West Wing) and B-movie queen Brenda Bakke (Groom Lake), both of whom do about as well as possible with the material given them. (Bakke really does have acting chops to go with her considerable beauty, but for some reason she always seems to come up with terrible roles.) The rest of the cast is similarly pedigreed, and do about as well with the material (a young Brendan Fletcher is particularly notable playing Busfield's son). I wish I could tell you that the acting is a good enough reason to see this, but it really isn't. The movie is really, really badly-written, with subplots set up and then abandoned, characters completely changing (in one memorable case, a particular character, played by Sharon Baker, goes through what seems like three or four complete emotional makeovers in the space of roughly ten minutes; well, I guess it looks good on one's resume), and a deus ex machina ending that raises more questions than it answers. I thought the whole idea of deus ex machina was to tie everything up neatly. Silly me. **",1227052800,2,2702,4.781584582441114

971835,4,6305120021,"This is the second attempt at a film of this Stephen King story and it succeeds far better than the first.  Most of the action centers around a remote truck stop near Area 51.  At the stop you can fuel your vehicle, have a bit at the diner, rent a cabin or sign up for a backpacking tour.  But the locals and some guests are in for a major change when something happens to the local truck population.  The trucks begin to move on their own and they seem to be moving with a purpose.  And that purpose is not especially fond of humans.

Soon the truck oasis becomes a prison as the humans are trapped by marauding trucks.  A truck-engineered chemical spill prevents help from the outside.  It is up to the handful of survivors to find a way to continue to survive.  the trucks may have some use for humans but they don't need many.  Will anyone manage to get away and back to truck-free civilization?  You will have to watch and see.

In Maximum Overdrive Stephen King spent his directing time by directing the trucks and not the actors and the film suffered for it.  This time we have better direction of the cast and the setting has been improved (in my opinion).  The story holds together well and there are moments of real tension.  The threat of the trucks is well displayed and the tension feels real.  My only real problem with this version is in one scene where a vehicle goes by with the driver clearly visible and then the camera changes to show the empty driver's seat.  Other than that this is a fun TV horror/thriller and worth a look see.  Check it out.",1182124800,6,1566,4.341379310344828

I don't know, I guess I'm easy to please, but it seems to me that if a movie can get you to that point where you care about the characters, and they've put them in a spot where you're rooting for them to overcome their particular ""troubles"" - in this case an interesting mix of homicidal trucks - then it works.

Timothy Busfield (the only big name in this one) stars as Ray, a man who has moved to the near-Area 51-town of Lunar. He and his son, Logan (Brendan Fletcher) are trying to make a new life for themselves. However, that will have to be put on hold for the time being, as driverless trucks are attacking the truck stop he works at. Because of the trucks, many people are stranded there, including a former hippie, a newlywed couple, a military man and his daughter, and two truckers. They must band together to survive, and find out the cause of this threat.
Based upon the Stephen King story from his ""Night Shift"" collection, the movie is, agreeably, not bad for a made-for-TV movie, as it is quite chilling in a few scenes (The Tonka truck attacking an innocent mailman, and the spill generator in a control truck inflating a radiation suit which then grabs an axe and takes care of the drivers). Tim Busfield is good as the hero, and the supporting actors, being first time actors, get a passing grade from me. It is rumored that this was given a PG-13 upon video release, and then got more gore to bump it up to an R, and regrettably, that cut is not included. The movie is presented in widescreen, despite being a TV movie. Little grain is shown, and the print is quite clean. The extras fall flat, however, just being trailers for ""Soemtimes They Come Back...Again"", ""The Tommyknockers"", and the movie itself. Trimark does make some good DVD releases,. Unfourtunately, This isn't one of them. Good try, though.

Anyhow, this version [is] even worse than the original and its mindboggling what can get made into a film these days.  Yeah, I know it's straight to video (...).

971962,5,6305120021,"Make no mistake, ""Trucks"" is pure bad horror movie. It's so awful, and so stupid, it's a pure delight!
Timothy Busfield (""thirtysomething,"" ""The West Wing"") is the only big name in the movie, as a gas pumper who's moved to a small town with his son. Busfield's Ray and a host of local yokels (a nose-pierced teenage girl, the old war veteran and diner cook, a coupla hick truck drivers, a mystical ex-hippie, the strong female presence, a bickering married couple and an Army guy who served in Area 51) are trapped in a diner as a bunch of trucks without drivers storm the place.
It's best to watch this movie with a sense of humor, and surrounding yourself with a bunch of sarcastic friends will help even more. It's pure hoke, and it isn't hard to imagine Stephen King groaning in his seat-- or maybe even guffawing as ""Trucks"" takes cinema corn to an all new low. It's breathtaking in its sheer awfulness.
Thing to watch for: The little toy truck with big plans for an innocent mailman. Only problem with the movie is that this truck shows up only once, but maybe that's just leaving room for the sequel. We can only hope.",990921600,2,1125,4.492682926829269
971963,1,6305120021,"TV movie version of the King short story contains some truly loony scenes.  (like the guy who tries to escape the trucks by fixing his broken truck.  D'OH!)
When the trucks of the world unite against mankind, it's up to ""thirysomething""'s Timothy Busfield to save the day.  You'll root for the Peterbilt.",981676800,2,304,4.8076923076923075
971964,3,6305120021,"I don't agree with most people about this movie. I think that it was a toned down version of Maximum Overdrive, but still worth watching.  If a person is completely into possessed inanimate objects, this is definitely a  movie worth watching.",924480000,2,242,4.878048780487805
971965,1,6305120021,wow! this film is the top 10 worst movies I ever seen! don't even rent it! I only saw it 'cause it is based on a Stephen King novella. I would tell King to take his name off the movie!,917913600,,184,3.625
7883449,3,6305120021,"Not the best quality copy of this TV movie but doesn't seems to be a big budget movie so am overlooking that.  I saw it on TV when it aired and remembered it being a pretty good movie.  But I remembered wrong.  It is just okay.

The big budget movie ""Maximum Overdrive"" is better with more action and hard rock music while this one is slower with a bad ending.",1525996800,,360,4.1
