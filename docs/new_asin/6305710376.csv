1071446,5,6305710376,"Being a true wrestling fan really brought this Pay Per View to my attention.  This was probably one of the greatest Pay Per Views in the WWF's history, and featuring possibly the greatest singles match in its  history, the Hell in a Cell.  WWF Champ Triple H defends against Cactus  Jack, the hardcore persona of Mick Foley, with his career on the line.  I  won't give out any endings, but the effort these two superstars were  tremendous.  Other matches included Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho  vs Eurpean Champion Kurt Angle and the Rock vs the Big Show for  contendership of the WWF Championship.

This time the barbed wire  was set alight and it was extremely vicious, but Mankind vs Undertaker Hell  in Cell was even better at King of the Ring 98.

The Big Show vs Rock was good and the same can be said about The Hardys vd Edge and Christion, No Holds Barred Kane vs  X-pac, and too cool and Rikishi vs the radicles(Chris Beniot, Saturn and  Dean Malinko).  Other decent matches were the Jericho vs Angle match which  was a exiting opener, the Dudlys vs the New Age Outlaws which was a little  slow, the Mark Henry vs Visera match which really wasn't bad for those two  together in a match, and the Tazz vs Bossman match which was very fast  about 1 minute, those are all the matches foe No Way Out overall it was a  very good show.",951782400,3,682,4.106060606060606
1071504,3,6305710376,"This PPV had amazing build-up.  I myself ordered it and I bought it on tape and it was amazing.  Some matches were bad but the main event was just great.

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Jericho for the IC Title.  This was a good opener but I thought the ending was just bad.  Angle steals the Ic title after Jericho went for the Lionsault but Angle put the belt in the way. (3.5/5)

Dudley Boyz vs. New Age Outlaws for the World Tag Titles.  This match had a good ending but a bad match.  The exact opposite of the first match.  The Dudleyz win after a 3-D. (2/5)

Mark Henry vs. Viscera was a complete snorefest.  It was a big, big man's match because they both weigh over 400 pounds.  Mark Henry wins with a Scoopslam but this match was to slow. (1/5)

Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz was a good match with a suprising ending.  The Hardyz were about to win when Terri pushed Jeff off the top.  Then the APA pushed Matt into the Unpretier by Christian to win the match. (3.5/5)

Tazz vs. Big Boss Man wasn't even a match it was just a beatdown which was pretty brutal.  Tazz came down to the ring and got attacked by Boss Man and Albert. (1.5/5)for the attacks.

X-Pac vs. Kane in a No Disqualifications Match.  This was a good match but the ending seemed unusual.  Paul Bearer told Kane to hit X-Pac with the steel steps but X-Pac kicked them back into Kane's face and pinned him but Paul Bearer didn't do anything. (3/5)

Rikishi & Too Cool vs. The Radicalz was a very good 6-Man Tag match but the 3-on-1 assualts got boring after a while.  Finally Rikishi & Too Cool win after Rikishi hits a Banzai drop on Dean Malenko. (3.5/5)

Big Show vs. The Rock in a #1 contender's match for the World Title at WrestleMania.  This match could have been so much better.  Shane mcMahon returns and hits The Rock over the head with a chair followed by a Chokeslam by Big Show wins it. (2.5/5)

Triple H vs. Cactus Jack in Hell In A Cell for the World Title.  This could be possibly the greatest match ever.  This is much better then Undertaker vs. Mankind at 1998 King of the Ring.  I was in tears at the end of this match because Cactus career was over.....until WrestleMania.  (5/5)

The reason this PPV gets a 3 is because of the undercard.  The undercard just doesn't deliver.  The Main Event is great but I would hesitate to but but you have to rent.",1104278400,,2336,4.260273972602739
1071505,3,6305710376,"Chris Jericho v. Kurt Angle  IC Title

  Pretty solid match.  Should have been a submission match.  Angle cheats and hits Jericho over the head with the title and wins.***1/2

New Age Outlaws v. Dudley Boyz  World Tag Titles

  It was very interesting.  I guess you could say the Dudleys cheated because they used the lead pipe and hit the 3-D.***

Mark Henry v. Viscera

  Not a very good match.  Mark Henry's mom comes down and distracts Viscera.  Henry wins with a big splash.*3/4

Hardy Boyz v. Edge & Christian

  Great match with a twist at the end.  Jeff goes for a Swanton Bomb and Terri?????pushes him off.  Then the APA pushes Matt into the Impailer from Christian.***3/4

Tazz v. Big Boss Man

  Really dumb match it wasn't even a match.  Tazz attacked Boss Man when he entered then Albert interfered.  DQ.  They beet the heck out of Tazz.***1/2  For the attacks.*****

X-Pac v. Kane  NO DQ

  Didn't take long for Tori to interfere.  She got a tombstone.  Paul Bearer told Kane to hit X-Pac with the steps.  But X-Pac kicked it back into his face and got the pin.***3/4

Too Cool & Rikishi v. The Radicalz  6-Man Tag

  Nothing great.  Too many 3 on 1 attacks.  It got dumb.  Rikishi wins with a Banzai Drop on Dean Malenko.  Then they dance a lot.***1/4

Big Show v. The Rock  #1 contender for World Title

  Funny match.  This is the first time I've ever seen refs fight.  Shane McMahon makes his return and hits Rock over the head with a steel chair followed by a Big Show chokeslam and wins.****

Triple H v. Cactus Jack  Hell In A Cell World Title Career v. Career

  WOW!!!!!!!  This had to be match of the Decade maybe Match of All-Time.  Jack falls off the top of a cell through announce tables.  Then gets up and hits HHH lite barb wire. Jack piledrives HHH through the cell.  Then he falls too.  All of a sudden Pedigree.  Triple H retains his title and his career.*****",1099612800,,1892,4.402366863905326

Intercontinental Championship - Chris Jericho V Kurt Angle
Nice opener, with cool moves including Walls Of Jerico and Angle Slam. 7/10
Tag Team Championships - New Age Outlaws V Dudleys
Pretty cool tag team match. At the end someone gets hit with a led pipe but I can't remember who. 7/10
Mark Henry V Viscera
Decent enough match. Mark Henry's wife May Young (who's like 70!) interferes which is funny. Mark Henry uses just a scoop slam to win which is a bit crap. 6/10
Hardy Boyz with Terri V Edge & Christian
This match was to get a shot at the tag titles at WrestleMania. The Hardys get screwed by Terri, but the match at WrestleMania is actually a triangle ladder match with these 2 teams and the Dudleys. Cool match. 7/10
Tazz V Big Boss Man with Prince Albert
The match ends by DQ after just 27 seconds because Albert interferes, which is a bit crap. However they keep on beating up Tazz and Boss Man even breaks his Nightstick over Tazz's head. 5/10
No Holds Barred Match - X-Pac with Tori V Kane with Paul Bearer
This match could have been better. they fight up near the entrance and X-Pac tries to climb it. Later on Kane Tombstones Tori. In the end X-Pac wins using the steel steps to keep Kane down for a pin. 7/10
Too Cool & Rikishi V The Radicalz W/Eddie Guerrero
An alright 6-man tag but nothing amazing. Benoit and Rikishi can both do far better. 6/10
Wrestlemania Qualifying Match - Big Show V The Rock
This was a pretty cool match, although pointless since the main event at WrestleMania becomes a 4-Way Elimination match. Anyway, they fight in the crowd for a bit and later the ref is knocked out. Shane McMahon returns and hits Rock with a chair allowing Big Show to pick up the win. 8/10
WWE Championship Hell In A Cell Match - Triple H  V Cactus Jack
This is why I give the event 5 stars. An absolutely amazing match! They fight inside the cell and ring for a bit, using the steps and a chair. Later HHH busts open a section of the cell by throwing the steps. The fight outisde the cell and Cactus gets a 2/4 wrapped in barbed wire. HHH climbs the cell and Cactus follows. HHH saws Cactus's head with the barbed wire when Cactus was almost at the top of the cell and Cactus falls down onto the Spanish announce table. Later on, when they are both on top of the cell Cactus lights the barbed wired 2/4 on FIRE! and hits the Game over the head with it! Cactus signalled for a Piledriver on the fire, but HHH backdrops him RIGHT THROUGH THE CELL and then RIGHT THROUGH THE RING! Unbelievably Cactus gets up again, but Triple H wins with the pedigree. Both men were bloody by the end. This is one of the best matches EVER! 10/10",1086048000,,2661,4.311377245508982

1071508,5,6305710376,"In all the years that I have been a fan of the WWE, the 2000 No Way Out pay-per-view is probably one of the best that I have ever seen. This video is worth owning just for the ""Hell in a Cell"" match between Triple H and Cactus Jack for the WWE title. Overall, it is probably one of the best matches Triple H has ever put on. Not only was the match suspenseful and violent, but is also Mic Foley's last match with the WWE. This truly made the pay-per-view an emotional experience. Mic Foley definately ended his career on a high note. The rest of the card is also very well rounded. Some of the great matches include Chris Jericho vs Krut Angle for the IC Title, X-Pac vs Kane in a ""No Holds Barred"" match ( with Tori getting a tombstone from Kane), and the Wrestlemania qualifying match between Big Show and The Rock.
Overall, this is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Most WWE shows only feature a few good matches with a lot of average matches thrown in. However, almost every match on the card was enjoyable and the ""Hell in a Cell Match"" offers an amazing end to the show. If you are a WWE fan, this is a must buy.
A solid 5 stars...",1078099200,,1143,4.107142857142857
1071509,5,6305710376,"No Way Out 2000 is a great PPV. Good matches, good storylines and good moves leading up to a unforgettable main event!!
1. WWF Intercontinental Championship
Chris Jericho W/Chyna(Champion) v. Kurt Angle ***
An O.K. Match, and a good opener. Many good moves such as The Walls Of Jerico and the Olympic Slam.
2. WWF Tag Team Championships
New Age Outlaws (Champions) v. Dudley Boyz ***1/2
A good match, and perhaps the first time any members of DX where outsmarted in a match. Also many good in this match moves such as the 3D, the Wazzzzzzzzzup and the Bubba Bomb.
3. Special Challenge Match
Mark Henry v. Viscera ***
Not a great match, the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is beacuse Viscera sends the steel stairs flying using Mark Henry's body, Mark Henry's wife May Young interferes and Mark Henry Hard Scoop Slams the 496 lbs. Viscera.
4. A match for a WWF Tag Team Title shot at Wrestlemania
Hardy Boyz W/Terri v. Edge & Christian ****9/10
A really great match, a lot of this match was dominated by E&C , with Edge using entertaining moves he never used before like a Powerbomb or the Piledriver, and Christian turned air born to take out the Hardyz. But, when the Hardyz where on top it was nothing but high-flyin' action, using moves such as the Hardy Boyz Leg Drop, the Swanton Bomb and the Corkscrew Moonassault!!
5. Tazz v. Big Boss Man W/Prince Albert ***
Nothing to report here, the match ended in disqualification 27 seconds after the match had started because Prince Albert interfered. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because the attack is long and Boss Man breaks his Nightstick over Tazz's head.
6. No Holds Barred Match
X-Pac W/Tori v. Kane W/Paul Bearer ***
An O.K. match that didn't live up to it's expectations. Kane Tombstones Tori and X-Pac pins Kane 1...2...3 using the steel stairs.
7. 6 Man Tag Match
Too Cool & Rikishi v. The Radicalz W/Eddie Guerrero ***
Not a great match, not one of Too Cool or the leg broken Rikishi's best performances. As usual Radical member Dean Malenko trying to get a cheap shot on Rikishi, but it backfired and he ended up getting BANZAI Dropped to cost The Radicalz the match-up
8. A match for a WWF Title shot at Wrestlemania
Big Show v. The Rock ****
A very good match. A typical two championship materials going head to head into the crowd, get out, finisher, interference while the referee is knocked out, match changes hand. This match is no exception (Interference for the Big Show), while two referees beat the holy hell out of each other, Shane McMahon returns, hits The Rock over the head with a steel chair so Big Show could pick up the win.
Main Event. WWF Championship and Cactus Jack's Career - Hell In A Cell
Triple H (Champion) v. Cactus Jack *****
A phenomenal match that started off well with HHH on top, beating him up and using the steel steps as a weapon. Later on Cactus got a steel chair inside the ring, both men getting their fair share of beatings. Later on HHH busted the Cell open with the steel steps, lucky fo Jack because the door was locked. They where outside when moments later Cactus got the 2/4 wrapped in barbed wire, with that in sight HHH had no choice but to climb to the top of the Cell, sawing Cactus's head with the barbed wire to where he fell 20 feet through the Spanish announcers table. Up top the Cell was where both men continued to beat the holy hell out of each other, then minuets later Cactus lit the barbed wired 2/4 on fire with some kind of gas fuse on the top of the Cell. The match appeared to be over as Cactus signalled the Piledriver, but HHH through him over his head where the Cell broke and Cactus fell 20 feet, and fell through the ring. Unbelievably, Cactus got up, but HHH gave him the Pedigree two pick up the victory and retain the WWF Title. Although at the end Cactus refused to be carried out on a stretcher and left, Career over... standing!!",1058918400,2,3870,4.459802538787024

Chris Jericho takes on Kurt Angle in a pretty good matchup for the WWE Intercontinental title. The Rock takes on The Bigshow, and in the main event, Cactus Jack takes on Triple H in a brutal Hell In a Cell match! Cactus Jack and Triple H break outside the cell and beat the holy mess out of eachother. Cactus Jack even nails HHH w/ a 2 by 4 wrapped in barbed wire, and later sets it on fire when the two men fight on the roof of the cell! This is a bloodbath that I won't soon forget. Not for the faint-hearted. Both men beat eachother to a bloody pulp. So if that's your cup of tea, tune in & take a look at this video. It rocks, man!",1033776000,,785,4.006369426751593

1071563,5,6305710376,"The awesome PPV streak continued for the WWF as No Way Out 2000 took place to set up Wrestlemania 2000.  Cactus Jack lost a challenge for the WWF Title against Triple H at the Royal Rumble (***** match).
Cactus asked for a rematch and Triple H granted if Jack would put his career on the line.  Cactus agreed and made the challenge a Hell in a Cell match.  It would be a good idea to see King of the Ring 1998 before you see this one to get an idea of Foley + chain link.
We start with an absolutely mind-blowing promo from Mick Foley setting up tonight's main event.  ""It will be soon, but not tonight.  Though my nights are sleepless, I still dream.""  HOW COOL IS THAT!!!  This tape is worth the price for the promo alone.  How often do you hear that?  It's THAT good and any fan of wrestling should see it.  ""You may say this is no dream, this is a nightmare.  Maybe.  But it's my nightmare and I decide when I wake up!""  Awesome.  I still get chills.
IC Title Match - Chris Jericho vs. Kurt Angle - Kurt was European champion at this point and he insults the audience starting a trend for him.  Good match, but you could probably tell that from the participants. ***3/4

Tag Team #1 Contenders Match - Edge and Christian vs. Hardyz - One of the best feuds of 1999-2001 continues.  They keep the highspots down and the basic formula match up.  Good all around. ***

No Holds Barred - X-Pac vs. Kane - X-Pac and Kane used to be a team.  X-Pac double-crossed Kane and stole his girlfriend Tori.  Kane is mad.  Match happens. Bleh. *1/2
Six-Man Tag - Too Cool & Rikishi vs. Benoit, Malenko, & Saturn - The Radicalz introduced wrestling back into the WWF after a long absence.  Benoit and Malenko are miles above everyone else in the match, but they elevate everyone around them.  Excellent match. ****
WWF Title #1 Contender Match - Rock vs. Big Show - Rock won the Rumble, but it was revealed Big Show actually won.  This match was to settle the score.  Ending comes out of nowhere and was pretty shocking since the ending was considered a foregone conclusion. **
WWF Title - Hell in a Cell - Triple H vs. Cactus Jack - If Cactus loses he retires.  If he wins he gets to main event his first and only Wrestlemania.  This reminded me a lot of John Elway in the Super Bowl against the Packers.  It was his last chance in the ""big one"".  For everyone who ridicules wrestling because it's ""fixed"" or ""fake"", watch this match.  Check out the emotion in Mick Foley's eyes as he walks up the ramp.  Listen to Jim Ross voice falter as he calls the match.  This is why I watch wrestling.  The match itself is one of the best cage matches ever, right up there with Magnum T.A. vs. Tully Blanchard.  This is also the only retirement match that I've ever seen where I didn't know the outcome in advance.  Great, great moment.  I don't think it will ever be duplicated. ***** I'd give it more stars, but that's as high as the scale goes.
In the End: An absolute must for new WWF fans or for people think of wrestling as dumb garbage.  Mick Foley gave an absolutely unbelievable performance and Triple H got pushed up the ladder that much further because of his performance.  Absolute highest recommendation ever.  For any product.",1017792000,,3641,4.368107302533532

Also, this  is the last time you will see The New Age Outlaws for a while as Billy Gunn  is no longer in DX.

1071640,5,6305710376,"On Raw a couple of weeks before the PPV, HHH growled to Foleythat their match at NO WAY OUT would not be a repeat of their amazingStreet Fight at Royal Rumble.  No thumbtacks, no barbed wire - none of that.  And Foley didn't seem to have much of a problem.  But he had just four words for The Game: ""HELL...IN...A...CELL! ""
Now this got me kind of worried.  Not about them putting on a bad show; after Rumble 2000, I knew these two superstars would give it all their best, maybe even more.  I was worried that both men would REALLY push themselves to the limit and probably get badly injured just over a month away from WrestleMania.  They didn't, thank God, but still.... both managed to elevate themselves YET AGAIN to a new platform of great.
I had a feeling that this PPV would not top the Rumble... and it doesn't. However, I thought that this was an excellent show and definitely worth the money.  It had a few dull matches (Mark Henry vs. Viscera, Tazz vs. Bossman) but many of the others were very, very, very good. Too Cool & Rikishi vs. The Radicals gets a good response; the IC match between European Champion Kurt Angle and IC champion Jericho is excellent... both men are favorites of mine, and they work well together both on the mic and in the ring; Kane vs. X-Punk was all right, already tired of that feud; Hardyz vs. Edge and Christian, another good one; The Rock vs. The Big Show was good also, bringing Shane O' Mac back to the WWF for a pop, which turns into boos as soon as he costs Rock the match for number one contendership to the title. And, of course, the main event.......
When watching this on PPV, I couldn't help but to feel a huge air of anticipation.  No match in a long time had gotten me this hyped.  Oh, I forgot to mention the stipulation: if HHH loses this one, Foley goes into WrestleMania as the WWF Champion... if Foley loses, he has to retire.  The match itself had some intense psychology between Cactus and The Game, complemented with even more intense blows.  As expected, Foley doesn't disappoint fans with his high drops and here's something new to add to the WWF's list of weapons: a flaming two-by-four wrapped in barbed wire, which Cactus gives a hesitating blow to on HHH""s head. When the match ended (very unpredictably, might I add), I was once again amazed at their performances.  Some even think this shadows the Street Fight from the Rumble.  Make your own decision, but WATCH THIS ON TAPE if you haven't seen it!  It's worth it.

7894697,4,6305710376,"1.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Kurt Angle vs Chris Jericho (c) w/Chyna

Angle is out first and cuts a hilarious promo on the Hartford Whalers. No cannot tell me that Angle wasn't a joy on the mic during his rookie year in the company. Nonetheless, Chyna and Jericho are out next with Jericho insulting Angle before getting the match underway. The first half of the match rolls back and forth at a quick pace. Angle tries to damage Jericho's left shoulder early on and stays focused on it for most of the match. Half way through, Angle counters a clothesline from Jericho into an Olympic Slam for a nearfall. Angle out of frustration attempts to use Jericho's championship as a weapon on him, but Jericho counters it into a Walls of Jericho but Angle makes it to the bottom rope. The fight creeps to the outside where Angle attempts to use his European Championship to hit Chyna with, but she blocks it. Jericho pushes Angle who accidentally collides with Chyna into the steel steps. Jericho gets Angle back in the ring and goes for the Lionsault, but Angle cheats and uses the IC Championship as a shield, causing Jericho to collide face first into it. The ref never sees it, tending to Chyna, but rolls back in the ring to make the fall, giving Angle the win. Tremendous opening match that saw Angle become the first and I believe only Eurocontinental Champion.

2.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: The New Age Outlaws (c) vs The Dudley Boyz

The Dudleyz rush the ring attacking the Outlaws to get the match underway. The Dudleyz make consistent tags, working over Road Dogg and Gunn for a good sum of the match. As the end draws, Bubba Ray pulls Gunn off the apron and down to the floor and hits him in the shoulder with a lead pipe. Back on the inside, D-Von and Bubba successfully hit a 3D on Road Dogg for the win. Short but fun match with the Dudleyz winning their first of many Tag Team Championships in the company. Road Dogg and Billy are seen arguing after the match. Billy would disappear from TV shortly after this to have surgery on a torn rotator cuff. This would be the last PPV the New Age Outlaws were a part of until 2014.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Mark Henry vs Viscera

This match all took place after Viscera had attacked Mae Young on a previous Raw. At this point in WWF, no one wanted to see 2 big men at the size they were go at it in the ring. That should've been kept and left in 1994--not brought into 2000. The fans made no bones about stating their disapproval at the match as a ""boring"" chant is heard by the fans. Mae Young runs into the ring to check on Mark, but gets knocked down by Viscera because of it. Vis attempts to splash Mae, but Henry knocks him with a shoulder tackle. One bodyslam later and the match is thankfully later.",1456444800,,2960,4.792156862745098
7894698,4,6305710376,"Thanks to an online download, I was able to check out No Way Out 2000 which was the final stop on the Road to WrestleMania and for those that like to keep track of this sort of thing, this was the second No Way Out event after the initial 1998 event. This event was following in the aftermath of the Royal Rumble with unsettled business involving not only The Rock & The Big Show but also Triple H & Cactus Jack. One other big story was the PPV debut of four former WCW performers known as The Radicals in Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Perry Saturn & Eddie Guerrero.

Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho vs Kurt Angle. At this time, Angle was the new European Champion while it should be noted that during this time also, Jericho had formed an alliance with Chyna. Jericho started off with momentum causing Angle to retreat to outside before coming coming back with a series of suplexes. Angle was able to target Jericho's arm with moves such as armbars and arm ringers before both men went back & forth before one man's use of a belt not only lead to Chyna getting involved but also an argument between the referees that would come to past later on. This was a good quality wrestling match as you would expect from both men.

WWF Tag Team Champions The New Age Outlaws vs The Dudley Boyz. This was a dream match for that time as one of the best tag teams in WWF was facing off with the best tag team from ECW with the Dudleys looking for revenge for being put through a table on the previous SmackDown. However due to that attack, Billy Gunn had suffered an injury which became a focal point here making this match short with Road Dogg wrestling a handicap match before the Dudleys were able to make history to win their first of many championships in the WWF/E.

Mark Henry vs Viscera. This match was off an angle between Mark Henry & Mae Young and to be honest, the less said about that angle along with this match, the better but at least this kept short as well.

Edge & Christian vs Hardy Boyz. After being attacked by the Dudleys, Terri made her return in the corner of the Hardys with the added fact that she paid for the Acoltyes Protection for the night with the APA watching the entrance. These two teams were more well known for having their series of Ladder matches dating back to the previous No Mercy event all the way to adding the Dudleys in a few months to the birth of TLC matches. This was a tag team wrestling clinic with both teams trading momentum by using the strategy of cutting off one member of the team, building up for the hot tag but one moment to check out would be Edge catching Jeff Hardy in mid-air with the spear months before that spot was a sight in the Ladder/TLC matches. However, the moment of this match was when Terri got involved and who she decided to help out that shocked all four of the competitors before the APA did their service as well.

Tazz vs Big Bossman. This lasted less than a minute with Tazz being attacked by Albert after having the tazz mission applied with the aftermath lasting longer in which Albert & Bossman beat Tazz down only for Tazz to keep fighting back till he was finally put down.

No Holds Barred: Kane vs X-Pac. This was the build up for months between these two with the feud getting more personal with Tori turning on Kane that lead to the return of Paul Bearer. Kane was dominate from the start of the match by overpowering and beating down X-Pac all over the arena. X-Pac was able to use undermining tactics along with Tori's interference to get the momentum in his favor. Paul Bearer & Tori were also able to get involved with each party returning the favor before a set of steel steps made the difference in this short but brief brawl.

Too Cool & Rikishi vs Radicals. It should be noted that Eddie Guerrero was still injured at this time with a dislocated elbow from weeks before so this team of the Radicals consisted of Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko & Perry Saturn as Eddie Guerrero served the cornerman of the team before some ""moral support"" was enough to send Eddie back to the dressing room. Rikishi was supporting an injured an injured ankle which was the focal point of this match as each member of the Radical team was able to attack the injury with Malenko always being the man to stop the other team's momentum by attacking Rikishi's ankle. However, the action was able to get out of control before one man was just clearly over matched. This was a fun match with everyone stepping up their game along with the storytelling of Rikishi's ankle.

The Rock vs Big Show. After the ending of the Royal Rumble & many weeks of campaigning from the Big Show (including video footage), he gets his one on one match with The Rock with the WrestleMania title shot on the line. Rock started things off with a slap before taking the fight to the Big Show. Show was able to get regain control by using his size and power with both men taking it to the outside while also bringing a chair into the match. However, it was a mistiming with the referee that lead to a series of events that brought a referee for an earlier match to get involved in a way nobody expected before one person made his return in way that not only shocked the crowd, the announcers but especially The Rock.

Hell In A Cell: WWF Champion Triple H vs Cactus Jack. It was Triple H's Title vs Mick Foley's Career as Mick Foley would end his career if he didn't win the title here. Weeks prior to the match, Cactus had vowed that he was going to climb to the top of the Cell and crash onto Triple H but early on, there was a notice that the Cell door had more locks than usual to ensure that it wouldn't happen. Both men started brawling here before Triple H was able to take control using the steel steps and a chair to dish out punishment to Cactus while also using the Cell as a partner. Cactus was able to recover off of one mistake that lead to Triple H being busted open before using the chair himself by delivering an elbow drop from the top to the floor with chair in hand. However, Cactus was able to find a way out of the Cell with a mistimed steps through before making the hole bigger. They took it to the announce table where a piledriver was given on top of it with no give before Cactus was able to get his hands on a barbed wire 2x4 that had the reaction Triple H gave when seeing it only for it to cost Cactus at one point in knocking him off the Cell through the announce table. The two made it to the top of the Cell which lead to the Barbed Wire 2x4 to be set on fire before Cactus took another dangerous fall that sealed his career. This wasn't on the level of their Rumble Street Fight but certainly told a great story of Cactus not giving up without a fight.

Overall, this event set the Road to WrestleMania with some quality matches, storyline developments as well as shocking results with the only negative being some of the short matches that were pointless such as Henry/Vic or Tazz/Bossman while another note should be that the opener and the main event have been released onto DVD so I'd give this event a 3.5 but will boast this up to a 4 as I recommend seeing this online or the Network.",1418342400,,7166,4.341044776119403

WWF Intercontinental Title Match:

Chris Jericho (c) vs. Kurt Angle

This was a great match to start a ppv off. There was plenty of action in and out of the ring such as Jericho moonsault of the steel steps. This match had the potential into being a true classic although it did its job in engaging the audience to No Way Out. 8/10

WWF Tag Team Title Match:

Dudley Boyz vs. New Age Outlaws (c)

A short match that shows the Dudley boyz future manoeuvres. It was fairly entertaining although I believe it was too short for a championship match. Dudleys win making wwf history as two title changes in a row. 7/10

Special Challenge Match:

""Sexual Chocolate"" Mark Henry vs. Viscera

This was a short but brutal super heavyweight match-up with a crappy storyline aswell. Don't waste your time with this one.  4/10

Tag Team No. 1 Contender Match:

Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz with Terri

This match really surprised me it was very fast paced with plenty of action. There was a complete arsenal of high flying manoeuvres performed by both teams throughout the match. This was the match that got me engaged after the boring Henry vs. Vis match. 9/10

Tazz vs. Big Boss Man with Prince Albert

This match should've been no dq from that Tazz wins by dq in the opening 2 minutes. Only good moment of this brawl was Boss Man whacking Tazz with the nightstick. 3.5/10

No Holds Barred Match:

X-Pac with Tori vs. Kane

A good match that seemed a little short than what it intended to be. There were plenty of hard hits throughout the match with a grand surprising ending giving X-pac the win. 7/10

Six-Man Tag Match:

Too Cool & Rikishi Phatu vs. Perry Saturn, Chris Benoit & Dean Malenko with Eddie Guerrero

This was another exciting match that once again got me back engaged to the ppv. A very fast tag team match with a huge amount of cool manoeuvres used by both teams. Rikishi plants his ass on Beniot and then Malenko to pick a well deserved victory. 8/10

Wrestlemania Qualifying Match: Big Show vs. The Rock

To tell the truth this match was a real let down to the whole ppv. It seemed throughout the match that neither Big show nor Rock knew what they were doing. Luckily the interference from Shane O Mac saved the match making it worth watchable. Big show wins. 6.5/10

Hell in a Cell - WWF Championship Match:

Triple H (c) with Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley vs. Cactus Jack

This was definitely one of the absolute best main event that I`ve ever seen in a WWE pay per view event. It elevated the ppv to greatness in other words. Foley and HHH delivered a match that none of us will ever forget. There is tons of blood throughout the match bleed by both competitors. I will never forget Mick getting back dropped through the cell. I would like to say that Mick Foley was the real people's champion of the WWE who put his life on the line just to give us the viewers a show that will never be forgotten. Thankyou Mick for your 19yrs of wrestling entertainment. 10/10

Overall mark is 63/90 which is 70% saying that this ppv was a one match ppv although in my opinion a match that all wrestling fans need to watch to comprehend the true passion that Mick Foley had for wrestling.
