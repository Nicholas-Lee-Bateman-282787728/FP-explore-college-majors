8370249,4,B002HEWGUE,"I enjoyed it. This is a memoir on film, with the building and launching of a boat as the frame within which Eric tells the story of his life.  He has had some fascinating adventures getting to where he is.  The story is mostly told, rather than shown, but Eric is always doing something on screen while he talks. He might be clearing brush, knotting a rope around a rigging piece, sitting around a campfire telling old tales, or building a small boat from lumber, glue, nails, and paint.

One cannot go back in time to film the incidents he relates, but one can have an engaging activity onscreen while the stories are told, and that is done well. The individual episodes kept my attention.  The visuals were interesting - beautiful countryside, a foal being born, his dog herding a very small flock of sheep and something unexpected.  The repeated motif of the boat building and ultimately sailing it where he had been as a child -- all these keep the arc of the story afloat. The instrumental music by Broceliande and Avalon Rising also forms a pleasant and lively audio background.

In the interests of full disclosure, I do appear for a few seconds in this film, in the background -- that is why I happened upon the completed film.  I'm glad I did.",1251590400,2,1252,4.5377777777777775
