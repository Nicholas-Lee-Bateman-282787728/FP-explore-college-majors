295965,5,6300270300,Irwin Allen was the Master of  turning out disaster Movies. During his time he turned  out a large number of  movies from the Towering Inferno to When Time Ran out.  The cast  is fimaliar to  people who watched tv. Aleen tended to use  actor several times in his movies and Ernie Borgine  was one of them.,1327881600,5,305,4.321428571428571
295966,5,6300270300,"A CLASSIC Irwin Allen disaster movie with some drama and sap opera soap thrown in! Great special effects! The Master of Disaster!
One day they will release ALL his 1970s-80s Classics!",1324944000,4,183,4.935483870967742
295967,4,6300270300,"If you don't like disaster movies then steer clear of this made for T.V. offering, as there is nothing here you would like, but if you love these films then you will find something here worth the price. Like i said nothing new just all the stock people trapped in all the same ways as other movies like this , but keeps you involved and has action to spare.",1173830400,3,357,4.188405797101449
295968,5,6300270300,"This a great movie! When a Pinetree Prison worker(Neville Brand)< starts a forest fire by using a cigarett,
there's much in store for disaster movie fans! Ernest Borgnine
and Vera Miles give good honest perfomances. Also effecteive is when a girl from Donna Mills' First Grade Class,on a outdoors
field trip,gets lost within the raging inferno! Donna Mills is
frantic and completely terrified for the girl's safety! Also along for the ride,is Patty Duke Astin and Alex Cord who play
doctors struggling to keep their marriage alive! They portray their parts well. And when they're thrown amidst the blazing forests,you really hope they make it through--just to tell each other how much they love the other! The special effects are impressive,considering it's made for tv. There's clean language as well,just with one curse word in the entire movie--not bad at all!",1035936000,14,863,5.127659574468085
295969,2,6300270300,"This is a movie about a forrest worker who accidently starts a big fire with his cigarette. Soon there is panic all over and urgent help is needed. But the whole movie is totally boring. The  characters are not interesting,  there is absolutely no one you will really like. Donna Mills is playing a  kindergarden teacher who seems to have lost a child in the fire. This is  the only highlight in this movie. But mysteriously no one is really  concerned about it but Donna. This drama is just a nice try to make a good  action movie.",950832000,4,532,4.377551020408164

296021,5,6300270300,"Back before cable, there were some wonderful, and some not so wonderful, movies of the week on all three (yes, just three) major networks.  After cable, these movies essentially disappeared, rarely played on any cable network.  They starred the big, and not so big, TV stars of the day.  Fortunately, some of these are out on DVD now, and I'm very glad to see that.

Fire! was one of my favorites.  I can't tell you how many times I stayed up and watched this on the late night movie.  It featured Patty Duke (then Patty Duke Astin), one of my favorite actresses of all time.  There was even a just-pre-Chips Erik Estrada.  On the trivia side, it also included James W. Gavin, a name that probably means little to most viewers of the day, then and now, but if you were a regular TV viewer, you might remember his face and/or voice.  He was a helicopter pilot.  Sometimes he had no lines, sometimes he wasn't even credited, and every now and then, he actually got a wee part.  This movie was one of them.  He had a plot of his own and a few moments out of the copter.  I always thought that was cool.  I know nothing about him really and had to look up his name, but I've always remembered him, from this movie, and all kinds of other appearances.

The DVD played perfectly with vivid color and good sound.  It also included the trailer.

For me, it's a happy addition to my collection.",1449964800,6,1385,4.34765625

296026,5,6300270300,"This made for television movie (circa 1977) is more of a catastrophe than a true disaster flick.  Even though it's claimed that the entire town, a lumber mill, and a lodge are threatened (not to mentioned a forest left a smoky pile of ash) very little of that is shown, certainly few people were seen in imminent danger (mostly `stars' having to explain their career choices).  There is one missing girl, a firefighter on fire falls from a tree, a pilot crashes but lives, a felon gets his just deserts.....  It's not as if they were dropping like flies facing a fiery finish.  This movie is structured like most of Irwin Allen's projects, with brief scenes bouncing back and forth between incidents to maximize the sense of tension or suspense.  The story is pretty standard.  You have unrequited love, a couple on the brink of divorce, a teacher who goes off the deep end when she abandons a pupil to the wilds, a couple of felons plotting their escape, the wise old country doctor.......  It helps having the likes of Ernest Borgnine, Vera Miles, Gene Evans, and Lloyd Nolan along to help sell the schmaltz.  Otherwise, it does have a certain amount of excitement and drama, if laid on a bit thick.  I liked it a lot so it goes into the collection to watch again (possibly as a double feature with Flood!).",1426809600,2,1309,4.583690987124464
