2822596,5,B000PHX8RA,"This is a great concept that allows JMS to directly market to B5 fans. It gets the broadcasters out of the way which is great. This works because B5 has such a large established fan base. However we need to wait and see how well it was implemented. Personally I am waiting with bated breath.

I really hope it works because there is so much more to do. I would love to see the Centauri trilogy and the continuation of Crusade in the following sets. The one regret I have is that Andreas Katsulas is no longer around so no more G'Kar. He was such a major character and a great actor that his loss will be felt dearly. If this was BBC they would just get someone who vaguely looked like him and add the makeup but am not sure that would for either JMS or the fans. As for Girabaldi's hair, I am not too worried, after all that is what wigs are for :-)",1179532800,35,849,4.083832335329341
2822597,5,B000PHX8RA,"At the New York Comic Con in February, JMS showed a couple of versions of the opening sequence.  Once was with completed CGI but no music.  Once was with music but incomplete CGI.  It wouldn't be right to give a detailed description but I can tell you that the CGI is excellent and that the opening sequence is wonderful, pure Babylon 5 and even manages to give a 'nod' to Andreas Katsulas. The music is also great.

To correct a previous review, the disk does only have two stories - one on B5 and the other on the Presidential starship.  Galen, as I undertand it, will be in some key scenes in both stories but doesn't have a segment of his own.

Oh, and the Director's Blogs are a hoot.",1177804800,79,689,4.2615384615384615
2822598,2,B000PHX8RA,"Run time: 75 minutes.

Are they kidding?  For two stories?  That means each one is less than the length of an episode.

As Ivanova once said in a classic episode of Babylon 5, ""I'll wait in the car.""

Rather than assume its going to be good, I'll wait to hear if someone whose opinion I respect gives it a thumbs up.",1177632000,24,316,4.114754098360656
2822599,3,B000PHX8RA,"I'm not sure where to start this review.  Maybe it is best that I stick with the basics.  Did I like it?  Yes.  Did I love it?  No.  Was it great to see some B5 again?  Hell yes.

With that out of the way, let us get to the meat.  I can't claim any special knowledge about budgets and such, but the reviewers that have come along before me and said these two stories must have been filmed with a limited, low budget, appear to be correct.  I'd wager this is the result of the bean counters and suits being stingy and providing just enough funding to ""test the waters"" and see what kind of response they may get out of any future investments.  Note to bean counters and suits: Keep playing with the fans of this show and they will bail on your a**es.  We're loyal, but we're not fools.  You bean counters and suits are sitting on a very powerful franchise here.  Nurture it and care for it.  Open your eyes and look around.  B5 done right steam rolls anything out there.  Give JMS and crew the money they need and your investment will grow.  You know that.  You've made a fortune on the original series DVD sales.

Possible low budget aside, yeah, it was good to see Boxleitner playing the president again.  He still cuts a fine figure in that suit.  Whenever I hear him act out JMS' words, I often daydream about Bruce and JMS as co-presidents of the U.S.  But, that's just a silly dream.  And yes, it was good to see the station on screen again.  It brought back a lot of happy memories.

Without spoiling it for others, when JMS worked in the little explanation about Franklin and G'Kar, I have to confess I got a little teary-eyed.  There were some stellar moments here in CGI, but also in portions of JMS' writing.  JMS still knows how to yank the heart strings.  Few do it better in my opinion.

If you are a B5 fan, this is for you.  You will not want to miss it.  Like me, as a fan, you may be a bit disappointed in the overall effort, but when the end credits roll, you'll feel a bit richer for having watched.  Remember that feeling with the original series?  You watched and maybe felt just a bit more alive.  B5, for me, has always been about hope for the future while simultaneously enjoying one kick a** story.  Yeah, ""corny"" as it may sound: hope.

Buy this, put it in your collection and hope more and better stuff will come along.  I believe it will.  ""Faith manages.""",1177545600,,2384,4.260089686098655
2822600,5,B000PHX8RA,"Wow, this is really exciting for all the B5 fans. The cover is up on JMS's Babylon5scripts.com, By the way. Technomage Galen returns, along with our greatest hero, John Sheridan. Prince Regent Vintari, third from the Centauri throne, is aiding President Sheridan on a quest.

As the official site says: ""One part of the story follows Sheridan as he picks up an unexpected visitor on the edge of Centauri space, Prince Regent Dius Vintari, and a warning about what will come afterward delivered by the techno-mage, Galen. The other part of the story is set aboard Babylon 5, as Colonel Lochley summons a priest from Earth space to deal with a problem that may have dark supernatural overtones."" The stories will intersect on various levels, of course.

The stories travel everywhere: from Minbar, to Earth, Mars, the future, the distant past, as well as B5 itself, of course. Best of all, they're written by the original producer, JMS, the one who wrote most episodes of the beloved series. He's determined to use better technolgoy to make much better special effects. With his fantastic gift for story and our beloved character, it can't miss.",1177459200,53,1143,4.917098445595855
2822601,5,B000PHX8RA,"Quite possibly the most concrete sci-fi TV series of all time is back! This is very exciting for Babylon 5 (B5) fans! If you are new to the series, please check the existing universe of B5 DVDs here at Amazon. Some of the spotlight reviews provide a list of the order in which to start watching.

This is the first in a proposed series of anthology format direct-to-DVD releases. The DVD contains two interwoven stories featuring three B5 universe regulars (Sheridan, Lockley and techno-mage Galen (of Crusade)) and some new characters, including a Centauri Prince.

This had a (working) title of ""Voices in the Dark"", but I don't see it mentioned on the DVD box cover.

Originally JMS was planning three stories but the two stories ended up getting bigger, so the third story (involving Girabaldi) was postponed for a future release.

Needless to say the decision on how many additional Babylon 5 DVDs to make and how frequently to make them will be partly affected by the sales of this one. So you know what to do, buy early and buy often ;-)

Update 6/1: The official babylon5 website has posted a trailer (yes a trailer!) and two director's blogs under ""The Lost Tales movie"" segment... The trailer starts quietly but explodes halfway :)

The DVD
=======
Ergonomics: The DVD is easy to slip in and out of the case. It comes out real easy, no need to flex or put pressure on the DVD like some dvd cases have

When you put the dvd in the dvd player and do nothing, playback starts with a two-minute promo for the direct to DVD animated release ""Superman Doomsday"".

There is one audio track in english and subtitles in english. No other options.

Voices in the Dark
==================
You can watch the two stories together or you can watch them separately. The separate titles are ""Over Here"" for the B5 story and ""Over There"" for the Sheridan story.

I don't want to spoil the story or the plot or anything like that but the things I liked:
* nicely done in-movie tributes to G'Kar and Dr Franklin (Beyond the Rim)
* It was so nice to have brand new B5 universe stories!
* A lot of subtle things in the movie were a treat for B5 fans. This shows that special attention was paid to make this true to the B5 spirit, and not yet another shoot'em up in space.  Also I appreciated that it did not have the traditional tv/movie mentality of saving-the-world in the last 30 seconds of the show.
* Nice views of B5, and some nice ship views (but never enough!)
* The first story (Lockley/B5) was a bit over the top at times, and Lockley talked a bit too much at times. Not that I am complaining, I'm just pointing it out :)
* The closing lines at the end of the movie could have an additional meaning: you could read into them that they are also talking about future of dvd releases - perhaps :)

Bonus Features
==============
1) Beyond the Rim Memorials for Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar) and Richard Biggs (Stephen), duration: 13 minutes
2) Fireside Chats: JMS answers fan questions on camera (almost 19 minutes)
3) JMS Diaries, production diaries (with some funny moments (eg sock puppets instead of actors)), 21 minutes long
4) Interviews with JMS and the three stars of the dvd (Sheridan, Lockley and Galen), duration: 17 1/2 minutes.
*) Total of bonus features: Around 80 minutes long

Why buy it?
===========
If you are a hardcore B5 fan (and you know who you are), this supports B5 in a way that encourages the masters of the universe to fund JMS for more and more B5 universe projects!

When looking at the price please keep in mind that this is a direct to DVD release, with no TV/cable revenue and no theatrical release revenue. Viewers like us can make a difference by buying it!",1177459200,228,3681,4.532428355957768

2822656,5,B000PHX8RA,"I originally purchased this when it was first released, and at least I can now confirm that only the earlier versions appeared to come with that little Franklin/G'Kar comic book as this 2016-era one did not.

My original dvd sat safely on a shelf for a few years and fell victim to what other commenters have written about - how the Warner Brothers Home Video DVDs for the Babylon 5 series tend to be of not-that-great quality. (""DVD Rot"")

For when I popped the DVD in the player/s (several different makes/models over a few hours to test) it spun and spun before auto-ejecting or locking up.  Odd that I have found scratched DVDs hiding under the sofa that still played, but the pristine shiny Lost Tales DVD was only good for a drink coaster.  From what I have read in the comments for the TV series DVDs, can at least attest that the Quality Assurance Team that pressed seasons 1-5 unfortunately were on hand when the Lost Tales DVD was first produced.  :(

Amazon saves the day again!  This isn't exactly a stock item in stores in 2016, so I thought I might be out of luck.  Five minutes and $14.00 later, all is right with the world.  DVD (the 2016 one) just arrived, and plays without issue.

BBuy had a sale a while back, so I have 2 copies of S1 (2 bad discs), 3 copies of S2 (1 bad disc), 3 copies of S3 (0 bad discs. Wha?), 2 copies of S4 (1 bad disc), but only 1 copy each of S5, Movies, Crusade, TG/INB, LOTR, and of course now have TWO copies of the Lost Tales.

Thanks again to Amazon for keeping out-of-circulation DVDs available.  I may break down and snag that (almost) ""complete series"" one of these days.  B5 is a great series, and having working discs for the whole run is a must!!",1472688000,2,1702,4.314465408805032

2822669,4,B000PHX8RA,"I'm a huge fan of Babylon 5 and jumped on this the moment it was announced originally and just rebought it on a whim after not having seen it for years.

At the time it was released it was to be the first of a series of direct to video releases which would eventually get into some of the bigger storylines and characters.  After a disappointing performance JMS abandoned the project and it joined the ranks of Crusade and Legend of the Rangers as a failed B5 spinoff.  The early death of several of the main actors killed any chance of further projects.

Having said all of that, is this movie it worth watching?  If you're a fan of B5 then yes.  The second episode is centered around an older Sheridan returning to B5 for the first time years after the formation of the alliance.  Bruce Boxleitner is as likable as ever and the story is entertaining if straightforward.  The first episode is unfortunately a little weaker and draws out a cute idea a little too far all while leaning on the slightly painful acting of Tracy Scoggins.  I always found her to be the weakest character on the show (ignoring a certain long term telepath that I think we all tried to forget) and the intervening years haven't brought any improvement.

Yes, it's low budget but if you can still watch B5 with it's primitive CGI scenes then you won't mind it.  Also in a show known for epic introduction sequences this ranks up there with season 5 as my favorite.",1470700800,3,1440,4.458015267175573

and a demon in Babylon 5, the second President John Sheridan deals with a reporter, and
the third Galen appears to Sheridan in a dream and asks him to prevent the destruction of
New York by stopping the person who will do it before he can do it.

It's both odd and nice to see old favorite characters like Sheridan, Lockley, and Galen and
visit with them again.  Wish this had become a series of movies.  How about it, guys and
gals?  Another movie or some more books, please??  Must watch for Babylon 5/Crusade fans

I seriously adore the Babylon 5 universe, cheese and all.  As far as it went from a really good 1968 Analog magazine story brought to life, it always had at least a little bit of that resonance at the core, even if the explosions in space almost always went boom.  For reference, I watched two of the earlier ""movie"" series items (which seem to predate this by many years, going by the Amazon entry) and liked them OK -- a bit of a reach, but OK.

This is...this is...words fail.  I don't usually give one star reviews -- everyone deserves some credit for their art (even bad art) and if you can't say something nice, don't say anything.  But I was genuinely sorry I watched this, not because the original was perfect or I expected something high budget, but because it lacks competence and speaks more to people who think about going to church on Sunday than people who like classic space opera.

It's heavy on dialogue, and there are just enough special effects to keep things interesting.  The special effects are greatly improved over those of the TV series.  This was IMHO the least cheesy of the B5 movies or episodes (except for maybe ""Intersections in Real Time""), but B5 is lovable cheese done right.

I wasn't a big fan of Tracy Scoggins in B5 or Crusade, but she gives an excellent performance here, as do all the other main characters.  As usual, I don't think Ms. Scoggins was given as fun a script as Mr. Boxleitner, but her story was very clever.  Was so happy they brought back Franke for the soundtrack.

2822808,3,B000PHX8RA,"just stick to the series.  There is a review on hear somewhere that gives the order to watch the series in.  HERE IT IS:

First watch BABYLON 5: THE GATHERING from this boxed set. To be blunt, it is not very good at all. It is basically a pilot and not an especially compelling one. We meet some -- but by no means all -- of the important characters of forthcoming seasons, and get a taste of the B5 universe, but this is just a dull, chatty, uninteresting debut. And the make up for G'Kar looked like it was in planning stages! Very, very different from how he looked on the subsequent series.

Next, watch Seasons One through Four of BABYLON 5 the series. The first season is slightly more interesting than the pilot, but not by much. Season Two gets slightly more interesting, especially near the end of the season when the Shadows plot really kicks into gear. From this point to the end of Season Four B5 is incredibly compelling. Just be patient watching the first two seasons. You'll start getting hints in Season Two of how good it will eventually get, but there will still be plenty of dullish episodes instead. The series is not terribly balanced because the network changed its plans a couple of times, first telling Straczynski that the series was going to wrap up at the end of Season Four and then, after he had collapsed two season's worth of stories into one, telling him that the show would be renewed for one more season. So much for planning.

Next, before watching Season Five, watch another movie in this set, IN THE BEGINNING. This is far and away the best of the B5 movies and is fully as good and as entertaining as Seasons Three and Four. It goes back before the beginning of the series, giving the details of the Minbari was. But the narrative assumes you've seen the first four seasons.

Next, watch Season Five of BABYLON 5. Because he really had a different story arc planned for Season Five one had to be created pretty quickly. The whole telepath arc simply never caught fire and it does not represent the best of B5. The last third of the season focuses on the decline and fall of Centauri Prime and this is B5 at its best. There are a string of very, very good episodes as well as a very beautiful series finale. Mention must also be made of a lovely episode in the first half of the season written by the great Neil Gaiman.

Season Five was actually broadcast in split seasons and a couple of the movies -- THIRDSPACE and RIVER OF SOULS -- were broadcast before the series actually finished. Your call. Neither is all that great and neither really requires to be seen at a certain point.

The next movie, however, BABYLON 5: A CALL TO ARMS, should be viewed after the end of the series and the previously mentioned movies, and before the series CRUSADE. This episode features Bruce Boxleitner very prominently as Sheridan and is probably his last great hurrah in the series. The movie introduces the new and highly advanced space ship Excalibur and deals with a Drakh attack on earth, infecting it with a slow-acting virus that will kill all life on earth if a cure is not found (but since B5 the TV series gave us multiple glimpses into the future, we know that doesn't happen). This required the need for a search for a cure for the virus, a search that was continued on the quickly cancelled CRUSADE. The show never really got off the ground, but it had some interesting characters (especially Galen, played by Peter Woodward, who also appeared in the films A CALL TO ARMS and LOST TALES). I do recommend that fans of B5 see CRUSADE.

The next movie was THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS: TO LIVE AND DIE IN STARLIGHT. Horrible. This is the worst of all the B5 movies, the worst thing ever done in the entire run of the show. I honestly don't even recommend this for fans of the show. The most I can say in support of it is that it is one's last chance to see Andreas Katsulas as G'Kar. He died a couple of years later of lung cancer.

Last, and not quite least, there is 2007's THE LOST TALES. It is definitely not as bad as THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS, but not as good as IN THE BEGINNING. My reaction was that it was nice to see some familiar characters again (mainly just Tracy Scoggins's Captain Lochley, Bruce Boxleitner's Sheridan, and Peter Woodward's Galen). But definitely not B5 at its best. Most fans describe it as ""chatty."" There are entire scenes devoted to nothing but talk, and not terribly good talk at that.

A lot to see. For me the heart consists of the end of Season Two, all of Seasons Three and Four, the movie IN THE BEGINNING, and the last third of Season Five. My advice to anyone newly approaching B5 is to stick it out through it all. Much of it is dull, some of it even downright bad, but the best is very good indeed. If you are patient, you will find your patience rewarded.",1355702400,15,4832,4.411896745230078

I would suggest that a novice either watch all 5 seasons, the B5 movies and ""Crusade"" first or at least see B5 Seasons 2 & 3, ""In The Beginning,"" ""A Call to Arms,"" and the first 4 episodes of ""Crusade"" so that she/he can have enough of a sense of familiarity with Sheridan and Galen to understand what makes each of them the fascinating, complex characters that they are before watching this ""direct-to-video teledrama.""

As a standalone story, it was admitedly spartan and less-than-dazzling but considering the small budget that Warner Bros. had to work with, I thought they did a pretty good job. Of course I was won over by J. Michael Straczynski's character-driven script and would have enjoyed listening to the Sheridan/Galen dialog just as much if it were performed as a minimalist stage play, but I can respect the unfavorable postings and probably would have added to them if JMS didn't write it. Along with being the creator of this series, he wrote most of the scripts and knows these characters like a loving father knows his children - intimately and with unreserved affection. I hope that he creates more ""lost tales"" in the near future, even if Warner Bros. has to release them as low-budget direct-to-video one-offs, DC comics publishes them as collected comic books/graphic novels or some adventurous stage producer casts them as off-Broadway musicals!",1308960000,,1600,4.947955390334572

The scale and limitations have already been pointed out, so I'll just reference Dr. Franklin's great speech in 'Shadow Dancing' about focusing on what someone or something is rather than what it is not, rather that rattle on.  Simply put, 'Lost Tales' is pure B5, with great ideas, emotions, acting and visuals.  And as B5 always did, 'Lost Tales' achieves a well-earned optimism without shirking the weight of reality, which always serves to make both more inspiring, like a jewel framed in the perfect setting.  My only caveat, as a fan, is that there is no mention of Ivanova, though maybe there is a reason in the B5 backfiles for this that I don't know about.

2822820,3,B000PHX8RA,"""The Lost Tales"" represents a welcome - yet vaguely depressing - return to the universe of Babylon 5. The original series featured excellent writing and thought-provoking concepts, but failed to achieve mainstream success; so this low-budget DVD follow-up is clearly intended for the show's loyal fan base, and not for broad consumption. That's too bad, because Babylon 5 deserves a larger audience and a more prominent place in the annals of sci-fi pop culture.

I gather that Warner Brothers gave Babylon 5's creator and head writer, Joe Straczynski, a very modest budget to produce ""The Lost Tales"" - a matched set of two short episodes, each featuring a character from the original series. Due to the lack of funds, the final product looks strikingly spartan; indeed, ""The Lost Tales"" features only minimal sets (plywood corridors, mainly) and almost no extras. The CGI special effects are quite good, but in all other respects this DVD production looks cheaper than the series that inspired it, which was plenty cheap to begin with.

However, unlike some other reviewers, I think Straczynski did a pretty good job with this production, in spite of the obstacles he faced. Both of the mini-episodes presented here feature all the staples of the original series (good and bad) - clever dialog, solid characterization, occasional preachiness, and silly humor. As a result, ""The Lost Tales"" feels like *authentic* Babylon 5, even though it lacks the scope (and much of the cast) of the series.

The first ""tale"" is admittedly a little odd, since it features prominent religious themes that are somewhat unprecedented for Babylon 5. Also, the character played by Tracy Scoggins is a relatively minor part of the show's universe, and I'd wager that most fans would have preferred to see characters such as Garibaldi or Londo featured instead. But, at its best, the story is clever and creepy. The second ""tale"" is more my cup of tea, as it features a major character (Captain Sheridan, played by the charismatic Bruce Boxleitner), and a compelling moral dilemma. Taken together, these stories hardly represent Babylon 5 at its best; but they are reasonably good.

In summation, ""The Lost Tales"" is pretty compelling and very cheap - so, depending on your point of view, it either represents a laudable labor of love, or a crummy last stand for a TV show that always deserved more recognition than it got. But I must disagree with the opinion of fellow reviewer Jerry Kimball, who suggests that Babylon 5 has been ""surpassed"" by the likes of Firefly, Lost and Battlestar Galactica, making this production superfluous. I've always regarded Straczynski as a more thoughtful and serious sci-fi writer than the likes of Joss Whedon, J.J. Abrams, or Russell T. Davies - and while ""The Lost Tales"" isn't his best work, it does showcase his unique (and uniquely intelligent) approach to the genre. Babylon 5 hasn't been surpassed, because good writing never dates - so I will always appreciate the original series, just as I appreciate this well-intentioned but flawed attempt to resurrect it.",1292889600,2,3084,5.053045186640471
2822821,4,B000PHX8RA,"The good: The effects aren't the best but still more up-to-date.  Ultimately, they do the job of making the backdrop more believable which is what's most important.

The stories themselves have some very nicely written dialogue and you can see how Stracynski has evolved as a writer since leaving Babylon 5.  There's also a bunch of great bonuses including some behind the scenes work and touching tributes to the workhorse Andreas Katsulas and the underestimated Richard Biggs, who played a great African-American role model without ever having to draw attention to that.

The bad: Because it's a DVD release, there isn't a large cast so these often feel more like plays centering only on 2 or 3 people at once.  You won't get that same epic sweeping feeling from previous releases but the show was always about the individual character as much as the entire story.

If you're a Babylon 5 fan, it's an obvious get since it might be the last work in this universe.  If you're a science fiction fan, there are some nice shorts (that are even linked together a bit) but you're better off watching the show before jumping into this.",1291680000,2,1129,4.758974358974359

Babylon 5 life and had hints of greater potential for expansion.

The first tale hints of supernatural belief in the Babylon 5
universe and dealing with things that were viewed as just biblical
stories.  Lockley's encounter seem to show otherwise and her
resolution added to her character.

The second story involves the interaction of the technomage and
John Sheridan when presented with a devil's bargain.  His solution
was what I hoped it would turn out to be but was entertaining
never the less.

2822826,5,B000PHX8RA,"Two good, contemporaneous stories that show how good B5 could have been with modern computer graphics.  The video toaster graphics of the original series were state of the art for their time, but current CGI is much better, particularly the fully digital space shots.  The greenscreen CGI with live action actors for interiors is different from physical sets used in the original series, and still a little more artificial looking, but is generally convincing.  The stories here are worthy of the original series or Twilight Zone episodes.  They're very well done.  The first story is even a bit scary and manages to weave in religion, the church and lots of worldly and old-world themes that JMS is so good at.

Note that there are two stories here, the second a bit longer, plus a bridge between them.  It's a bit like a micro-arc in that there are two plots within the encompassing timeline of the two stories.  The two stories tie together nicely in time, but are mostly independent.",1272499200,,987,4.798816568047338

Babylon 5 Lost Tales is two stories in one movie a little shorter than an average episode each. The limited budget is obvious by the ""small"" feel to the tales and the shortage of characters from the series.
The first tale revolves around Lockley, now a Colonel, and the possible possession of a worker on Babylon 5. This is the lesser of the two tales, interesting but nothing special.
The second tale is better but still has the small feel of the previous story. It is about a warning by Galen to Sheridan about a Centauri prince who will one day become a threat to Earth.

In the second part, President Sheridan returns to Babylon 5 with the third-in-line successor to the Centauri throne knowing that as long as the latter lives, Earth's future may in jeopardy...
It is such a pleasure to see Bruce Boxleitner, Tracy Scoggins, and Peter Woodward again though the (evidently) low budget and poor graphics are nothing to be proud of. Moreover, the two stories are told separately which makes the whole thing rather bland. On the other hand, the tribute to the late Andreas Katsulas and Richard Biggs was heart-warming and brought back wonderful memories; may they rest in peace.

There were only about three different locales shown in both tales.  They did make a good attempt to explain this in tale 2 by saying that Minbari are minimalists.

This low budget straight-to-DVD movie was such a disappointment that I almost didn't even watch it all the way to the end.  The noisy, densely populated (remember 250,000 humans and aliens?) Babylon 5 space station now seems eerily silent.  You never see more than three people in a room and most of those people don't have any speaking parts.

There's no real action in this movie and we have far more monologue than we do dialog.  The sets are minimalist as is the cast.  There are only three characters that you'll recognize from the show, and the rest of the cast comes to five or six people.

The first part of the movie is a preachy, heavily religious piece of script that was pointless and a waste of time.  It was painful to watch and it was easily the worst script Tracy Scoggins has ever been forced to read.

Bruce Boxleitner doesn't show up until almost halfway into the movie and his lines aren't much better.

The movie is only an hour and twelve minutes long, however the story unwinds so slowly and is so painful to watch it seems more like three hours and twelve minutes.

The ending is extremely anti-climactic and even as the ending credits are rolling down the screen, you find yourself asking, ""is that it?  They call that an ending?""

The second story revolved around the ethical question of whether killing a person who might grow up to be a monster is ethical. If we knew that baby Hitler and baby Genghis Khan will grow up to be monsters, would it have been justified to kill them while they were still young and innocent? Can the future really be changed? Is hope always lean and on a diet?

Though the second story was good but nothing really special, it is the first story of the demon that wins a five star rating. I have recently been reading a lot about religion, especially books by atheists. I am not an atheist, but I was very interested in how atheists think. Some of their arguments are pretty convincing. For example, why does God allow so much pain? The question of pain and suffering is what sways most people towards atheism. This movie tackles this problem wonderfully.

The plot of the first story is as follows: Since man has journeyed deep in space, and found no angels and no God, his faith diminished to the point that priests became rare. However, a priest is called upon when a man is suspected of being possessed by a demonic spirit while aboard Babylon 5. The dialogue between the priest and the commander of Babylon 5 about God and atheism is just inspiring. It pretty much sums up everything I have been reading about atheism. But as you will see in the movie, the story takes a sharp twist. Is the demon really a demon? Do demons live in space, or were they cast away somewhere else by God? What's God's divine plan in creating demons in the first place?

This movie will tackle many theological questions, and this makes it quite unique by sci-fi standards. This is a movie I'm sure I'll watch many times.",1234656000,4,2206,4.4236453201970445

Watching the vid made me long for the glory days, but thank God JMS had the guts to do this one.  Sci-fi will never be the same since this series premiered.  I only hope I live to see more adventures in this universe.  I had a chance to talk to Tracy Scoggins at a Star Trek convention in 07.  She has such a good time with the original and with this film.  She was laughing and rather proud that she had been promoted to Commander.  Thanks JMS for keeping us thinking, all the while we are enjoying the experience.",1229385600,,640,4.275
2822841,3,B000PHX8RA,"I was really excited to finally get to see some new Babylon 5 after all of these years. Bruce Boxleitner's portrayal of Captain Sheridan results in one of my favorite on-screen heroes. Sadly, this two episode collection makes me realize that ""no man is an island"". Both Bruce Boxleitner and Tracy Scoggins are only part of the Babylon 5 universe, and both really felt like they were the only person in each episode, even though there were exactly 3 people in each episode of any significance. I always liked Peter Woodward's character as well, and was sad to never get to see the ""Drakh plague"" resolved in ""Crusade"".

While it was nice to see a continuation of JMS's masterpiece known as Babylon 5, it has a little bit of that feeling that ""Indiana Jones - Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" gave me. I don't regret buying this two disc set, but it did make me cherish the rest of my Babylon 5 collection even more. Ivanova, Garibaldi, Zack, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, G'Kar(RIP), Steven (RIP), Jeffrey Sinclair and all of the supporting characters just worked together so well. Thank you, JMS for giving us the Babylon 5 universe, and vowing to not taint it's memory with any more ultra low budget additions. Hopefully, Warner Brothers will give you a decent budget some day so that you may continue with your vision. It's just too bad about the TNT issues, and that the SciFi channel seems more interested in playing an endless amount of ""Ghost Hunters"" and fake wrestling than real science fiction nowadays. It's OK though, all I need to do to get some quality science fiction is just to pop in one of my 30+ Babylon 5 DVDs :).",1227312000,,1623,4.615916955017301

2822844,5,B000PHX8RA,"Most Babylon 5 fans probably come into this movie expecting far too much. There is no new story to be written (yet at least), the original arc was completed in the 5 season series. These stories are just meant to be gravy for B5 fans; some 'Lost Tales' to fill in the gap between Season 5 and the Series finale 'Sleeping in Light'.

The 2 stories themselves are well written and contain some trademark JMS dialogue. The first story has not been well received due to the fact that it is very wordy and a bit slow paced. But, the underlying message of the tale is pure B5 and revisits some of the themes of 'ancient' evil that arose in the B5 universe. The second story is more action packed and opens a new door in the story line for future volumes.

I can understand why some fans might be disappointed in this release, but  people really need to be more realistic. These stories aren't meant to create a new B5 universe but to add to one that millions have grown to adore. Finally, and most importantly, B5 fans need to support this release so we might see future volumes which sport bigger budgets. Don't forget, it was the fans who through their support brought the 5 seasons of B5 to DVD in the first place.",1214438400,,1211,4.349557522123894

As others have already stated the stories were a huge letdown and I feel it's a pity that Ms Furlan didn't have the grace to forgo huge fees to be a part of the anniversary story which was after all DeLenn's story as much as John Sheridan's.

In my honest opinion both stories felt incomplete especially Voices in the Dark.  I actually did a search through the menu to look for the rest of the story thinking there had to be a part 2.  But no that was it.

It was a poor substitue to what B-5 fans grew to love when the show was on the air.  Under the circumstances JMS did the best with what was available to him especially as some of the cast have literally passed beyond the rim.  To the rest of the cast that are still around I guess we can truly see it was ""just a job"" and there's no loyalty beyond that.

It's worth buying but only if you're a true B-5 fan and don't expect too much.  Many of the season episodes were better.",1214179200,,1088,4.118483412322274

2822850,3,B000PHX8RA,"The first story was more than a little forgettable. It was not good, largely I think because it featured the female Captain who was never really good even in the series. I also thought the religion in this one was a little over the top, there has always been a religious undertone to the series which is ok, but this one was far more blatant and to me didn't really feel like it fit in with the universe.

The second story with Galen and Sheridan, I thought was a gem and is really what this disc is worth having for. I might not rate the episode as good as some of the better B5 episodes, but I did think it was above par. And the person who played the prince in the episode was really good IMHO, looked and sounded like a Minbari when many other actors never even tried.

I thought the features on the disc were weak as well. It seemed like they took short interviews while on a break in the set or something and kind of chopped them up to make 3 or 4 different features. So some of the features tended to look and sound the same, often repeating what was said in another one which was sad. I didn't expect much in features though so this is sort of ok.

Yes some of the animations, sets, extras, and action scenes made this disc look cheap, but still I thought it was better than other live action straight to DVD movies that I've seen. I think it is unfair to compare it to the working show. Some of the animations may not have been great, but others were better than the original series so it wasn't all bad either.

Overall I thought it was a decent buy. It was more than anything nice to see a couple new episodes of B5 even if one wasn't worth watching. I hope that they come out with a couple more. I d",1210377600,,1711,4.11377245508982

The stories keep to the Bab 5 tradition of thoughtful, passionate storytelling and resonate with current events.  With three main characters returning in leading roles we can skip most introductions that eat too much time.  This means more narrative with classic dialogue.

It is to the credit of the fans that this movie appeared. For some reason, though, it lacked punch for me. The story is being told from different perspectives, which is a nice touch, but it lacks the energy of earlier stories.

Crusade didn't have it, Legends of the rangers did, this didn't. Seems a bit like Star trek that way: the one movie is good, the next isn't. The psychological background that is JM Straczynski shows through in the story though: nothing in the beginning is as it seems. JMS takes you along and forces you to think along unfamiliar patterns. And that I love.

2822859,3,B000PHX8RA,"Before I comment on the movie, I really liked a moment when a reporter, played by one of my most welcome character actresses, Teryl Rothery, asked Sheridan if G'Kar and Franklin would be attending the celebration of the alliance that was being held at BABYLON 5.  He replied no, that G'Kar was out exploring beyond the rim and that Franklin was with him.  This was, of course, a very subtle lament for the deaths of Andreas Katsulas in 2006 (to lung cancer) and Richard Biggs in 2004 (to an aortic dissection at the shockingly young age of 44).  Both were distinctive and likable actors.  Not many people are aware that Biggs was very close to being deaf, with the complete loss of hearing in one ear and partial hearing in the other.

I personally enjoyed both of the ""tales"" making up this DVD despite the fact that they were not terribly good.  Both were very, very chatty and one finishes the disc without much of a sense that very much happened.  Still, I loved seeing Tracy Scroggins's Elizabeth Lochley, Bruce Boxleitner's President Sheridan, and Peter Woodward's Galen (one of the more important and compelling characters on the B5 spin off CRUSADE).  Neither story will rank very high in the annals of B5 lore, but I can't say that I regret that the DVD was made.  And as I said, it was great seeing people in roles we knew them from in the past.  And can I add that Tracy Scroggins looks amazingly good for a woman her age?  I'm sure that we all wished that we could age so gracefully as she.

There has been a persistent problem in all the B5 movies.  The TV series always built its stories slowly.  Few of the standalone episodes were very interesting or even very good.  About the only one that was very good was one of the few written by someone other than Straczynski, a fifth season episode written by the great Neil Gaiman.  B5's excellence depended on slowly and meticulously told arcs that extended over long periods of time.  Its narrative style does not lend itself very well to the short form of a made for TV or made for DVD movie.

So, this is a pleasant thing to see for fans of B5.  But I would ardently recommend that no one unfamiliar with the world of BABYLON 5 to watch it until after they've seen the series.  B5 is an unusual show.  It was at its best very good indeed, but it built up to excellence very slowly.  The first two seasons are, in fact, pretty dull affairs (though rewatching the series after having made it all the way to the end is actually more fun than watching it the first time through, since you see foretellings of things that will later happen).  But it definitely rewards those who stick it out until the end.  But this DVD offering unfortunately is mainly just a way to revisit that which has already passed on.  Not that I wouldn't delight in seeing another.",1204934400,,2815,4.461839530332681

2822861,4,B000PHX8RA,"When I finally saw this DVD on a Netflix rental, I was amazed at how good it was. I was expecting disappointment based on the reviews here, and I think that's because most of them were too focused on what was missing.

This DVD is getting low marks from many of the 380 reviewers here because it is not the same as the Babylon 5 TV series. Certainly this was done on the cheap. The WB people have made tens, maybe hundreds of millions on the original series, but still they didn't want to spring for a full budget made-for-DVD release. Those were the constraints. Therefore, JMS (don't ask me to spell Babylon 5's creator's last name) wrote a script that could conform to the budget -- very few sets, very few actors, lots and lots of computer generated backgrounds.

However, this ""movie"" tells two great stories set in the Babylon 5 universe that do not require many sets or a large cast. For success, it only needed good dialogue and good acting to deliver that dialogue. Think back to one of the better Star Trek Original Series episodes, ""Court Marshall."" This was largely a courtroom drama. It consisted mostly of people talking. The cast of Babylon 5 The Lost Tales is perhaps equivalent to Court Marshall, with fewer extras. And there's a lot of talking. If that sort of thing bores you, you can skip this DVD. But if you can't enjoy two very good little dramas just because there aren't any space battles or people blasting phasers at one another, or attacking each other with swords and knives, then you really are missing out.

The first ""tale"" is a little bit like an Outer Limits episode, about the B5 Captain calling in a priest  because she fears one of her crew may be possessed and may require an exorcism. The second tale is about President Sheridan's return for an anniversary celebration on B5. A technomage shows Sheridan the future in a dream, a future of destruction and death for millions. Sheridan can stop this future, but only by committing murder.

Both of these stories are well-told and well-acted. The demon-possessed man and the priest in the first tale are both superb. In the second tale, Boxleitner's President Sheridan displays the kind of authority that comes with power, the annoyance with its downside, and the plot hinges on the moral dilemma, 'Would you have killed Hitler as a child, if you had the chance?' The technomage is well-played, too. The first tale also involves a moral dilemma: Exactly how do you deal with evil and how do you extract the truth from a confirmed liar?

What this DVD movie IS, is two excellent stories, told in a way that does not require an extensive cast or lots of interior sets. We can hope for future movies that will include all of that. But these stories almost *could* have been told effectively with sock puppets, as JMS jokingly hints. Our imaginations can make up for what is lacking, if the actors do their jobs. With the computer graphics on display here, we need not even imagine anything. It's all been done for us.

Is this DVD worth purchasing? Well, it is certainly worth seeing. I watched it twice before returning it to Netflix. I am notoriously cheap. Compared to the value you can get by buying one of the B5 season sets when they go on sale for $20-25, this is not a good value. Still, I would pay $5-6 to own this. Perhaps I will buy it through a DVD club.",1203897600,,3350,4.554817275747508
2822862,2,B000PHX8RA,"I loved much of the Babylon 5 series and all the movie specials done previously. These 2 stories had alot of promise but they are weakly written, stiffly acted by the ancillary cast, with no memory of previous events in the show and yet lots of nods to fan trivia.  I found the bonus material more interesting.

The first story involves a strange occurrence that suggests the supernatural and a catholic priest comes to the station.  Similar events happened in the movies ""Babylon 5: 4th space"" and ""River of souls"", and several episodes in the show and yet Tracy Scoggins' character says ""We've never seen anything like this.""  The editing leaves holes in the logical continuity and it is full of the worst heavy handed pedantic monologues.
The feel of the station is the same, with a few improved graphic effects. As was noted in other reviews -sets are spare and you can see this was done on a shoestring.

The second story is President Sheridan's return to Babylon 5 on the 10th anniversary of the Shadow War. The writing is marginally better, though Peter Woodard (Galen) suffers the worst.
The low budget isn't what ruined this for me - I couldn't believe the characters or the story because of the one dimensionality. I rate these as disappointing ""C"" grade movies that can only really be enjoyed by fanboys.",1203379200,,1315,4.724890829694323

2822866,5,B000PHX8RA,"It's tragic that JMS didn't take the opportunity for a feature film. The Lost Tales are between the television show, made for tv movies, and a feature film.

The graphics are amazing, a big step up from the already formidable graphics of the past. The acting, writing and sets are as you would expect for this type of release. Some of the writing leaves too little to the imagination. The acting is good, if rusty for the B5 universe. The sets had to be completely redone due to the old ones all being stolen, so they're not the ones that had 5+ years of work that the originals had. The new ones do however look good and add new elements to the older themes of B5.

The soundtrack was perfect, Christopher Frank was the man to do the soundtrack and it fit exactly.  The soundtrack combined with the graphics, the inside references and nostalgia. If you have seen B5 in the past but never really got into it, this is for you. If you were half the geek that I was (am) then you will love it. You will look past the 8 years of rust and see how momentus this is. Babylon 5 is among the top Sci-Fi stories ever, TV, movie, or print and this movie hints at the depth of the universe and gives me enough of a taste to really look forward to more work.

I was broken when the series ended, and attempts to continue it failed. I was nearly in tears to see that the studios hadn't forgotten about B5. This is a great thing for the story.",1201651200,,1428,4.200729927007299

If you're looking either for a continuation of the main story, or for grand space adventure, you'll be disappointed. That isn't what this is.

This is a short look at a very small part of the B5 universe. The two stories are only very loosely related, and either story could stand on its own. While the budget constraints are apparent, they're well acted and thought provoking.

The extra features are mostly interviews, which some folks like and others ignore. There's no ""B5 Game"" or blooper reel. Just some interesting insights into the thinking of Mr. Straczynski and the actors involved in the series.

Overall, those B5 fans that were primarily drawn to the action and combat facets of the series may be disappointed, but those that enjoyed the thought-provoking aspects of the series will also enjoy this.",1201564800,,963,4.853658536585366
2822868,3,B000PHX8RA,"A DVD with a real split personality, in part the CGI is really good, yet in some scenes they appear almost to have done away with sets to cut the budget. Part one in particular is almost reminiscent of a stage play, with three characters in one or two Spartan rooms pontificating endlessly on religion. Commander Lockley has come up against what she for reasons implausible and somewhat out of context for the B5 world, has decided is a case of demonic possession. She sends for one of the last priests in circulation, apparently they're dying out as humanity loses faith. Odd as Commander Sinclair could fill a corridor with assorted religious dignitaries and Sheriden had Brother Theo and his order, but then again, I suppose that's Valen and the President being more on the ball than the replacement. The whole thing is long winded and accompanied by really irritating camera work and a poor sound track. Perhaps it's only for B5 completists, but even they will be wondering what's going on as the quite overt religious element is so at odds with B5 as we know it that it really jars. Perhaps JMS has had a crisis of faith that triggered it.
Part two is more familiar, President Sheriden is on his way to a conference when the Technomage Galen crops up doing his Cassandra imitation with more portents of doom and destruction. Apparently Emperor Cartagias son is due become emperor to revamp the Centauri republic and will destroy earth to remove an obstacle to his goal. The simple solution to this is to pre-emptively assassinate the youth before he grows into this monster. Sheriden agonises about killing off the young man before coming up with an alternative, less homicidal solution.
While I'm glad that there's more material in the B5 verse, I can't say that it's that impressive, as a DVD the two stories don't gel in any way and only the second one shows any potential to add to the story arc. Neither would have made particularly good episodes and I'm sure that if JMS puts his mind to it he can write a single cohesive film length script better than this, even considering the clearly crippling budgetary constraints that have reduced cast and set to the barest minimum.
As has been mentioned in other reviews, the obituaries of Andreas Katsulas and Richard Biggs are poignant and easily the most moving parts of the disk.",1201478400,,2336,4.727941176470588

2822871,5,B000PHX8RA,"I loved this, after nearly 10 years some new stories out of the Babylon 5 universe. Sure the small budget meant there were not a lot of actors in it but all those who were played their parts really well and JMS's wonderful story telling makes it a compelling and enjoyable watch.

Watching the special features it is clear that this is the first in what JMS (and all us fans) hope is a collection of new stories out of the B5 universe, only by buying this DVD can we prove to Warner Brothers that it is worth giving JMS the money (and hopefully more) to create even more and bigger episodes. Bring on the revival!

The new CGI is amazing - B5 has never looked so good - the models of the station and other ships are wonderful and it was really heart warming seeing the ""shining beacon in space"" again at the start of the episode. Also due to the advances in technology we get some nice scenes of some characters in the huge docking bays and some cool new StarFury angles and movement.

Christopher Franke is back doing the music again and the new B5 ""Main title"" score is really upbeat, joyous, and just generally uplifting with its trumpets, strings, and choir voices. First thing I'm doing after writing this review is buying the soundtrack.

As well as the 2-part story / episode on the disc there are a good number of special features with a memorial to Rick and Andreas, interviews with the three main actors, JMS answering some questions, and doing a bit of a diary with this whole sock puppet joke in it.

Remember that Warner Bros only gave JMS a small budget for this so the episode is not on a grand scale like some in the original series - this is a new beginning, a test of the water, and if this DVD sells well then we will get more.

Apparently there was to be a story with Garibaldi which has been held for the future, this I would love to see. Londo was great so it would be wonderful to see him again and while I'm asking, something to do with the telepaths (Bester especially) would be nice too.

As I said in the title, more please.",1200528000,,2051,4.2979274611398965

2822873,1,B000PHX8RA,"When I saw that a reunion for B5 was about to be released, I jumped on it at once.  I barely read the description and didn't bother to wait for reviews.  Pre-order it had to be.  Didn't care what was going to be on it.  It was B5.  That's all I needed to know.

I should have waited.  i've never been so disappointed in my life.  The greatest has fallen.

Firstly, let me tell you that there are two stories on this disk, plus a memorial on it called ""beyond the rim"" which is about Richard Bigg's and Andreas Kasulas, both who passed away after the series completed.  This is a nice memorial, but I would rather buy a disk marked just as a memorial to them than buy it as part of these ""lost tales"" as a side note.  It is a nice tribute and if you can catch it somewhere, fans will enjoy it.

That said...these stories are LOW BUDGET, poorly written, and irritating. The idea here was to bring back the cast for a reunion.  but when only sheridan, lockley, and Galen are actually available for the reunion and they do not have the budget to rebuild those massive sets...you know that Lost Tales are a disaster waiting to happen.

none of the splendor we are used to seeing is there.  None of the drama or the wonderful tete-a-tete from the characters.  Everything is dry, dull, contrived, forced.  It's just not believable.  I never felt like they were ever on the station.  Just in a warehouse in California.  The budget is just so low that I do not believe anyone.

The two tales do not advance the plot or the storylines.  They are just there.  Empty and confused.

the fans deserve better.  B5 deserves better.  If MJS didn't have the budget and couldn't get his entire surviving cast together right now for the project, he just shouldn't have done it yet.  WAIT...do it when everyone IS available and you have the budget to do the job right.  Have respect for the fans and do a proper movie for us.  Give us Giddeon, Delean, Vir, Natoth, Lockely, Sheridan, Molari.  Maybe let us meet David Sheridan.  Or even let us see the crew of the Excaliber.  I still want to see more of Lt. John Matheson who turned out to be my favorite character in the series--of all the telepaths, the most fascinating since we never really got to meet him properly or come to understand fully what happened with him during the earth-telepath war.  There were so many directions this could have gone with a proper budget.

I am sorely disappointed.

This review is an edit of my previous review...I am sorry I was so angry in my previous version and not detailed enough on the plot!

2822874,4,B000PHX8RA,"I enjoyed the Lost Tales.  It takes place during Cmdr Lochley's post on B5.  There are some references to the late actors who played G'kar and Dr. Franklin.  The video is pretty much two short stories.  One that focuses around Lochley and the other around Sheridan.  Although I was satisfied with the production of the two pieces (the B5 station looked incredible with the current CGI) it did keep me wishing for more of the cast members to show up.
For me the part that made the disc  worthwhile was the obituary videos for Richard Biggs (Dr. Stephen Franklin) and Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar).  Both were very poignent and gave the impression of how much of a family all the actors had become because of their B5 experience.",1199664000,,722,4.637795275590551
2822875,4,B000PHX8RA,"I missed the release of this video and saw a question posted about it on a Babylon 5 list. The video was quickly added to my cart at Amazon and I eagerly awaited it's arrival - the first Babylon 5 movie in many years. The stories were enjoyable, though you can tell they were written to minimize the use of the original cast. The sets were on par, the acting was of the expected good quality, and the CGI was better than the original series. Since the setting was 10 years after the end of the original Babylon 5 series and the stories were written to be stand alone, there can't be as much depth as we were used to in the series. Overall, I rate this movie as a B+ due to the minimising of cast members and shallow story line. However, I really enjoyed seeing new stories from the Babylon 5 universe and recommend the movie as an enjoyable experience. I hope this movie is just to test the waters to see if there is enough interest to continue producing additional B5 movies. If so, I hope all who are interested show their support so more movies are produced.",1199577600,,1061,4.2835820895522385

2822877,3,B000PHX8RA,"I just saw the B5: Lost Tales DVD. While it is nice to see new B5 stories, the two presented in this series are more suited for a stage adaptation. There is very little of the epic sweep that the series had.

Essentially, each story is an extended conversation between two or three characters. While the conversations are occasionally interesting, they really don't remind me of the glory days of B5. They remind me more of the off-off Broadway shows I see in downtown. Low budget, one or two set pieces, people sitting around and talking.

(And really - after ten years, the first new offical B5 story features Tracey Scoggins and a priest? I like Lochley okay, but she is probably one of the least essential characters in regards to the B5 mythology. What, Claudia Christian and Jerry Doyle were too busy? C'mon now!)

The filming is okay they obviously did not spend much in making these episodes.

2822880,2,B000PHX8RA,"There are memorials to Andreas Katsulas and Richard Biggs. They were the best part of the DVD.  Hearing how Andreas lived and created G'Kar was very emotional.  But there was not one clip of him doing his magic.. even this could have been done better.

The opening seqences with images of the classic characters was nice but almost a bait and switch as there is almost no cast.  Everyone is Busy or in the case lost freinds (exploring beyond the rim)

Some of the behind the scenes about the effects was more interesting than the effects. But it is free on the website.

The script is awkward info dumps and scene setting lines tying long elegant Straczynski Soliloquy.. problem is that if you don't have an emotional bond to Lockley or Sheridan you wouldn't care at all.

This is not something to show your non-B5 friends they will never sit down for one of the real episodes.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news as my best Christmas gift was the complete series on DVD.

This was a high tech reading of Straczynski prose...

Has B-5 run its cycle? is it impossible to go back?  In this format sadly yes.

If you go to the website you will see some of the same extras on the DVD and there is joke about Joe wanting to do the whole thing with sock puppets.  The production value, CGI and plywood sets are so weak.. I think the puppets might have worked better :)

(Note the matte of NY in the future is nice..and the external ship animations of B5 bring back some nice memories after that it is all down hill)

I want to go back to B5... but not this way..

If they do #2 I will rent it first.. if it is like this I will not buy... I have a 120 hours of B-5 as it should be... no reason to tarnish the memory or my wallet with anymore like this.

I'd like to question the negative reviewers on their overall attraction to the show.  What did you like about the preceding adventures? If you only watched for the sci-fi aspects then I can agree that this was not the DVD for you.  Although, the CGI was fantastic.  My eyes widened in amazement at the new models for B5 and the other ships.  I also loved how the windows of the rooms had more depth than previous installments.  Also, the lone space battle was great to watch with the improve art work.  I checked to see who had done the CGI work on the DVD, and it turns out that the company responsible for the stellar art work on Stargate SG1 and Atlantis were the Technomages.  Bravo!
These two stories were designed to capture the emotions and character of the B5 universe.  A goal that JMS is well adept at accomplishing.  Once again he has mesmerized me with his ability to draw the depth and mystery of real life into this fictional world. Without discussing the plot, I would like to say that the stories are very thought provoking and at times moving.
If you're a fan of B5 or of good drama in general, I highly recommend B5 Lost Tales as an excellent addition to your DVD collection.  Here's to many more great stories in this wonderful universe that JMS has created!",1197417600,9,1549,4.453900709219858

This DVD had significant potential, but it was nowhere close to being realised. The Farscape mini series ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" did a good job and offers quality far beyond what you get with this DVD. They would have done better to make at least a two hour running time for each story and really delve into it. All of these stories have a feel of something written the night before a school paper is due - they're good, but the teacher knows that the student is capable of much more and expects (or at least hopes) to see it. The difference here is that I'm unlikely to pay more money for further Babylon 5 DVDs if this is what I can expect. Had the Legend of the Rangers not been purchased as well, I probably wouldn't have felt so negatively about this DVD.

I truly enjoyed the character driven arcs (I was actually applauding at the end of each story), the cgi was awesome, and was totally surpised by the judeo christian overtones on the 1st segment - never saw it coming (but then  I deliberately avoided the press on this release).  Nevertherless... GREAT SCIFI.  Thank You JMS!

That said, I was pleasantly surprised at the first story that merged religion and sci-fi in a way that isn't done very often, and I also enjoyed the second episode which at least let us see some great special effects that really did remind me of the original series.

But these two vignettes (for lack of a better term) are really about the characters, not the special effects, and I for one thought they were both well written, even if the acting did appear a bit strained at times (like it's easy to just jump back into a character you haven't played in ten years).

I started watching Babylon 5 from the pilot movie in 1993, and I attended the Babcon convention in 1996 in London, and I can completly understand the disappointment so many feel at seeing only three characters brought back in such a minimalist treatment of the grand Bab-5 universe.

So, my advice is to somehow get to view this without paying full retail.  Each episode is only a bit over a half-hour, and if you're a lifelong Babylon-5 fan you're likely to enjoy it if only for the bittersweet memories of those few years back in the 1990s when you couldn't wait for the next episode, and you felt so smart because so many of your friends simply didn't ""get it"" and perhaps couldn't ""get it"" if they tried because you had to really think about this show and preferably watch it from the beginning to ""get it"" at all.

This first installment of a potential direct-to-DVD series was clearly shot on the cheap.  The sets are spare and extras are almost non-existent, making creator JM Straczynski's universe feel positively abandoned.  The lack of a budget is also reflected in the short running time.  On the plus side, the CGI is terrific.  Hopefully, any future installments will feature a bit more action, as these two stories are extremely talky, particularly Lochley's section.

I watched this series when it first came on the air and followed all the way till now, but after Legend of the Rangers I was sure I would never get a new B5 offering. For a series with a scope, character, and depth of story that B5 offered this was a sad day. Then I heard about Lost Tales and I jumped for joy.

I got my copy of the DVD as fast as it became available and I was not disappointed. The first story I found intriguing in concept and redone special effects were impressive. However, to me the Lost Tales didn't come alive till we reached Sheridan and Galen. The interaction between these two was as impressive as ever. Galen's mysterious nature and double talk were as well written and acted as ever. Lost Tales has left me breathless and craving more DVD's.

Although I will always love Star Trek, Babylon 5 gave me a future that had real people who were not all self actualized. This was dirty and gritty and people were not always the heros we thought they were. So what does that have to do with... the lost tales? Glad you asked. I have enjoyed visiting B5 and seeing how the President of the Interplanitary alliance deals with the future including The Great Sentaurie Republic. How the commander of B5 deal with the cross roads of religion and reality.
I recomend this DVD. The actors provided the performance that we have come to expect from people who know there parts and have developed a relationship with then. The story was short. But, this was not the main feature it was ""The Lost Tales"". The fact that there are demons both internal and external was fun. The special effect were much improved over those of the show. Ten years results in a great deal of progress.
JMS you need to give us more. There is very little that seems to be smart or well exicuted that puts forward a story that has an epic feel like the original B5. I know this was never plannned to be a deep space franchise but there is more to be told. The first World War gave rise to the Second World War. The Galaxy of B5 has only started to be explored ( I hope).

2822906,3,B000PHX8RA,"Others have referred to this as ""B5 on a budget."" It might be that, but it's not an excuse (or a reason, I suspect) for the quality the first installment of ""The Lost Tales."" Before sitting down to watch it, my wife and I hadn't watched any B5 for two years or so. We watched it with someone who has never seen any B5, not much of a fan of movies or TV, let alone science fiction. She mercilessly ripped it apart, and made fun of it. It was sort of embarassing, in a way. At the end of that episode, we were all making fun of it, and I had a feeling that maybe B5 in general is just as bad, that I'd changed since watching it all through, that my tastes had changed.

I'm not sure what to say about the first episode. It was like a Twilight Zone or Star Trek episode missing the good part. I always appreciated B5 because it occasionally dealt with supernaturally things in an interesting, unclichd way. ""Soul Hunter,"" for instance. However, this was like some Trek ""omg parallel universe!"" episode that is never mentioned again, but with evil spirits. I think JMS would do well to read the Lurker's Guide for ""Soul Hunter""- the JMS of then has some ideas that JMS of today might find useful.

The second episode was a ton better, and more what I expected and hoped for a first try of ""The Lost Tales."" Not wonderful, but it had all the right stuff. It didn't make any moral statements, but it made you think about the choice that Sheridan had made and the consequences of that choice.

The big upside, as far as I'm concerned, is that it has greatly increased my appreciation for B5. I've often said to folks (including the non-B5 viewer mentioned above) about B5 who haven't seen it that while the first season is a bit cheesy and rough, it's well worth sticking with it for the long-haul. A couple days ago, a month after watching ""The Lost Tales,"" I started to watch season one again on Joost and even the first couple episodes are great, far better than I remember. I was overjoyed to find out that B5 does indeed rule, even the first episodes of the first season!

In short, even with the quality of the first episode being very low, I'd happily buy the next couple installments, if they are produced. I just hope making the first one is the warm-up that JMS needed to get back into the B5 universe.",1192752000,4,2305,4.328703703703703
2822907,3,B000PHX8RA,"I loved the original series and was disappointed by the first episode which could be titled Lochley meets the Exorcist.  It was boring and preachy.  I may be tainted as Lochley was never my favorite character and I always considered her as ""the part of Susan Ivanova will now be played by Tracy Scoggins"" due to the contract dispute between JMS and Claudia Christian.

The second installment is more like the original series.  Plots within Plots within Plots, usually with Sheridan in the middle.  It appears that JMS is stretching the history of the Earth Alliance out beyond the reign of Centauri Emperor Vir.  Perhaps one day we will see David Sheridan and Prince Vintari take up the mantle of leadership for good or bad.

I enjoyed the production over all but it seemed like something was missing.  Hopefully there will be a new episode soon with Jerry Doyle and Walter Koenig reprising their roles to bring the Mr. Bester Arc to a close.",1192752000,2,942,4.701219512195122

1) Only two major characters involved on screen, Sheridan and Galen (Lochley is in this too, but I never cared for her character).

2) Minimal sets, a la ""300""

3) Almost no Disc extras

Positives:

1) Very thoughtful, well written scripts.

2) Great performances by Bruce Boxleitner and Peter Woodward.

3) Kudos to JMS for not being afraid to deal with the supernatural in a reverent, serious way that doesn't go out of its way to mock or disparage religious belief.

Bottom line:  Think of this as pay-per-view for two B+ TV episodes.",1192579200,,549,4.75531914893617
2822909,4,B000PHX8RA,"The DVD is well worth buying for any B5 fan. It has 2 short episodes loosely connected. It would be nice to have more Lost Tales DVDs.
The Good:
-The second short episode was very much in the vain of B5 and I enjoyed very much.
-CGI was excellent, although more would have been a treat.
-The acting was oustanding, it seemed like the 3 main original cast never left their roles. The interaction between Galen and Sheridan was particuliarly engaging. The young actor playing the Prince was also quite good.
-nice extras on DVD

The Bad
-The lack of extra cast, shortness of each episode, short CGI shots implies WB is pinching pennies. This is pretty stupid if they want to revive an established franchise with a large fan base.
-The first episode I found jarring because it really felt like I was watching Twilight zone instead of B5, but once I got used to it was more enjoyable.",1192492800,4,880,4.5
2822910,1,B000PHX8RA,"I'm sorry, but this collection of two stories just doesn't deserve the Babylon 5 title. I still miss the original series--There's not been a better story-driven show on television since--and my hopes were high for this epilogue. Unfortunately, The Lost Tales doesn't deliver.

1: Though pitched as two intertwined stories, the only connection is a single comment by Tracy Scoggins... The plots have nothing to do with each other.
2: Both tales rely completely on dialog and internal drama. These elements were used effectively in the series but fall flat here.
3: With only Galen, Sheridan and Lochley plus a few supporting (new) characters, nearly all dark or CG sets and myopic plots, this 'movie' would have been more interesting as a fan film than an actual Straczynski piece.

I'm disappointed. And disappointed that I'm disappointed. I really wanted to enjoy this new addition to the Babylon 5 universe. If you've not seen, skip it and savor the memories of the original series instead.",1191974400,4,992,5.0426829268292686

If you are a fan, this movie is ok, it doesn't have any of the really epic stuff the other Babylon 5 movies had, but plot-wise I liked it. The one they did was address those actors who are no longer with us, which I liked a lot. The acting is as good as Babylon 5 ever was, Bruce kicks butt as usual. Peter Woodward is very cool, and Tracy Scoggins looks great for her age. The plot in the first story is the best I think, its independant and asks a lot of questions about how our religions survived when our culture hit space. The second story with Bruce is good because it hints at a possible future for the series. I sincerely hope they try to bring this one back someday.",1191974400,2,722,4.055944055944056

2822915,5,B000PHX8RA,"If you are looking to buy this movie, then chances are you are a fan of Babylon 5 already. For the uninitiated, however, B5 was a science fiction show in many ways similar to other series in the genre. It had weird aliens, cool spaceships, spectacular space battles, and so on. However, unlike many sci-fi shows and movies, B5 focused more upon the subtle and ""human"" aspects - even with some of the most alien of aliens. Morality, politics, mystery, hard choices, uncertainty, and the consequences of actions were all major themes of the series.

The Lost Tales is the first Babylon 5 movie or show produced in several years. After the main series ended there were several attempts to revive the franchise with movies, spinoffs, etc... Fans of the series may debate the quality of these attempts (I rather liked crusade, for example, but many disagree) but it seemed that nothing could be done to get B5 up and running again. I only recently heard of The Lost Tales and, while I was excited by the prospect, I was also a bit nervous - it had been a long time sense B5 and I wondered if they could get it up and running again.

Fortunately, The Lost Tales did not disappoint and was much better then I expected. The two stories were fairly small in scope but large in implication. Both had me glued to the screen wondering what would happen next and it took me little time to get back in the frame of mind of the series. To me at least these felt like Babylon 5 from the getgo - a very good thing. The stories were clever and interesting and I was glued to the screen wondering what would happen.  The second story, in particular, left several lose ends that could tie into future stories. Though the stories were small, with a notably small cast, but didn't seem to suffer from it. On a final note, the new special effects were great and B5 never  looked better.

I thoroughly enjoyed Babylon 5 the Lost Tales. It felt like a familiar revisit to an old friend (some comfort I badly needed today anyways) and I eagerly await and hope for the next installment.",1191283200,,2059,4.465425531914893

Her character is just anathema to me.  She blindly fought for Earth when they were so obviously wrong and never apologized for it.  And it still seems that she hasn't learned her lesson about taking stands for the right reasons.

The second part was all what's good about B5.  Excelent characters, horrible moral dilemmas, humor, you got it all here.  If this DVD was only the first part, I would have been sorely disappointed but it redeems itself with the second part.",1190937600,,623,4.5

The first episode is a spin on the Exorcist; it's the weaker episode by far, but it serves as an example of how a new show could come about based off the original. The second episode brings back Mr Boxleitner, who escorts a young Centauri, in line to the throne, to Babylon 5. However, he has a vision that this Centauri will be responsible for the destruction of Earth in the future and is told he must eliminate him in order to prevent that future from taking place. This episode features some very nice CGI of that Earth-Centauri war. It is also very well written, being somewhat didactic, and the actors perform their parts well and with pleasure.

Again, it is recommended for those who were fans of the original; to all others who have never seen the original, it is best to get your feet wet with the first four seasons before diving into these compendious tales.",1190764800,,1022,4.518918918918919

2822922,4,B000PHX8RA,"If you are a fan of Babylon 5, you must purchase this DVD.  Your purchase is a vote in support of the B5 franchise.

Be prepared that the quality of this first Lost Tales isn't what you would expect from JMS and the B5 production team.  This is a first attempt at restarting a franchise on video that has been dormant for 10 (?) years.  It was clearly prepared on a pretty low budget.  Warner Brothers probably gave the green light to see how many fans were still out there, but didn't risk a lot of money on the project.

The outcome suffers from the low budget in that we only get few exterior shots of the station and the interiors are small single set shots.  Don't expect to see the Zocalo filled with extras in costume.

Anyway, it was good to see the old characters back.  I do want to buy more of these stories on DVD.  JMS, you know what we want--lots of exteriors, lots of ships, lots of explosions, lots of aliens--and good stories.

2822928,3,B000PHX8RA,"I think that Babylon 5 is one of the greatest tv series of all time.  Unfortunately, this installment was nowhere near the level of the best or even average B5 episodes.  It's adequate, it has potential, and I hope there will be time for that potential to be realized, but I expected a lot more punch out of JMS' return to this storyline after a long hiatus.

Part of the problem for me was that I mistakenly expected a movie, a complete story; instead, this is two short episodes which are only slightly linked, and not (yet) a part of any big storyline.  Though what's shown on screen looks fine, the low budget is painfully apparent in the extreme austerity of sets, actors, extras, etc., compared to the visual scope and richness of the series.  Because each of these stories focused on just two main characters, the scenes did not have the emotional complexity of clashing, intersecting personalities which was always one of B5's greatest strengths.

The first story I found boring and pointless, a rehash of familiar religious themes.  Usually JMS can put a new twist on even a tired premise, but here he said nothing original or surprising.  The characters' monologues are highly repetitive.  Also, I never did like Lochley's character, and Scoggins' acting hasn't improved any in the interim.

In the second story, it was fun to see Sheridan in classic indomitable form, and while the plot didn't exactly cook, it certainly was a solid installment and had potential as the beginning of an arc.  Galen is always fantastic and brings a wonderful sense of wry mystery to his scenes.  I hope we'll see this plotline developed into something more, but so far it's just the kernel of a tale.

The extras are enjoyable if you're interested in writing process, acting process, and how episodes get made.  JMS definitely reveals his evil genius streak when he mentions how he likes to write scenes that will touch on an actor's real fears.  The memorials were very touching.

In all... get this if you're a hardcore fan, and enjoy another little glimpse into a fascinating world, but don't expect too much; this is just a B5 snack, not a juicy satisfying meal.",1190332800,,2159,4.7479892761394105

This was not a Babylon 5 movie.  It was a radio show with people walking around.  It is obvious that they skimped on sets.  It is obvious that they skimped on cast.  Hardly any of any.  It is two stories tied together by a common backstory.  I won't give away either story except to say that the plots were frangible.  Either could have been set in any other science fiction or non-genre ""universe.""  Perhaps somebody with a home video set-up will take these and make YouTube versions set in the Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, or even Law & Order SVU universes.

I thought that was both inappropriate and a bad story that went nowhere.  The second episode with Sheridan showed some potential, but also went nowhere in the end.  I would sum up this DVD as an hour of nothing!  I can't believe JMS couldn't even come up with 90 minutes of content for B5 fans!  I would like my money back.

Religious beliefs are a personal thing and should be kept out of movies unless it's a movie targeted at a specific audience that was made aware of it when buying it.

I have completely all DVD series I mean all of them. And I've watched all of them (starting from pilot through season 5 and ""Movie collections) about 5 times and about 3 times ""Crusade""(crazy ha?). And this DVD I'm going to keep for collection BUT as I said the start was promising the rest ...I do not know what to say. I do not like the talk with reporters in movie (waist of time because  there is not really truth and emotions in such as talks).Part of this movie looks like one of episodes when Michael Straczinski's project had a financial problems and was filming in dark studio (one table two chairs 3-4 people). And I did not like the easy solution if this consider powerful essence. There are no actions like in previous series Babylon 5. I just hope this movie is just a beginning.

In the first one you can appreciate the changes in visual effects more accurately since you have the original episodes to compare to regarding the main station. The dialogues are interesting and the camera angles are very interesting.
The other ""tale"" which, I admit, was the one I enjoyed the most, brings new light to the future of Babylon 5 since it takes place 10 years after Sheridan assumes his Presidency.
I recommend the viewers to check out the special features in the DVD, it'd help you appreciate all the effort behind B5 and to me at least, one of the best features was the tribute.
Perhaps this won't fulfill everyone's expectations, then again, if you are a B5 fan then you just got to have it.",1189987200,,835,4.5
2822939,1,B000PHX8RA,"I was a big fan of the series.  I even liked Crusade - to a point.  This video was just SO pointless.  A couple stories that don't need to be told, told anyway with no budget and no creativity.  The green-screen work was so rushed and poorly-executed, and the sets could have been in a Motel 6.

I was a bit derailed by the Earth being purgatory connotations, seemingly contradicting the original story of the first ones and how the Vorlons and Shadows molded the universe from chaos and order, yada, yada.  Andreas and Peter Jurasik made the show personable, so their presence was sadly missed.  Boxleitner has all the personality of a scarecrow, and Tracy Scoggins... eh.  They just couldn't carry it for me.

After watching this, I just felt that I gained nothing from the experience.  I appreciate a series being revisited to tie up loose ends (ie. Firefly, Farscape), but that didn't happen here.",1189987200,2,901,4.681528662420382
2822940,1,B000PHX8RA,"First, understand that I love B5, and will continue to support and purchase Lost Tales DVDs as they appear, in spite of the quality of this first one. I had such high hopes, but one can clearly see effects of a minimal budget, minimal sets, and minimal cast. The use of the big green screen technology fails in many wide shots, that clearly show actors standing in front of a screen. Sets look barren and overused. What furnishings there are look like they just arrived from IKEA. Lockley's bedroom wall looks like a free-standing wall set with a green screen window, which it is. You get no sense that your seeing her pacing in her bedroom. The one and only B5 corridor set, despite being shot from a few different angles, feels like we're seeing the same set over and over, which we are. This doesn't feel like 5 mile long B5, with 250,000 people. It feels like what it is, a few sets and a few people. The same holds true for the Alliance ship, where Sherridan sits on a tired old arm chair on a black set. I understand the Minbari are minimalists, but I'm afraid this just looked cheesy. Only on the exterior space shots do you get a feel for the old B5. Eventually I could no longer suspend disbelief, much as I really really wanted to, and the whole thing left me feeling a bit sad. You can't go home again.

The stories themselves had all the JMS hallmarks, but the first really felt flat and uninteresting. Sort of a B5 version of ""The Exorcist"" without the pea soup; a computer-generated fire effect in search of a story. The second story presented a true dilemma, and for a brief time placed us back in Sherridan's world, and as such was the only really positive bit of the DVD.

Acting was as expected. Scoggins just isn't believable. Boxleightner is sublime as always, in this role he was destined to play. And Woodward is over the top as usual, but that is part of the character, so I'm not complaining too much.

In summary, you can really see the effects of a shoestring budget. Perhaps a full-time director could have patched things up a bit, but maybe they couldn't afford one. Despite my negative review of this DVD, I still encourage you to buy it, as I did, and support the project. Now that many of the startup costs are paid, I'm hoping JMS makes enough from this first DVD to do a more B5-like job on the next.",1189987200,12,2333,4.395833333333333
2822941,3,B000PHX8RA,"O.k., so B5 was a fabulous series.....no debate. The regular season shows had a mix of impeccable episodes and lower-end fillers.  This particular DVD would be considered 2 lower-end filler episodes of the regular season. The stories were interesting to a certain extent but just lacked the overall awesomeness of the REALLY good single episodes.

I admired the Babylon 5 series because of the realistic entertaining plots about sociological issues among different species in space. This movie was realistic with the understanding that real day to day life can be anti-climatic and tedious. The stories have little plot, and have nothing to do with each other. The only thing that kept me watching was hope. I hoped there would be some dense plot(s) that would develop and make me want to care. Plot or purpose wasn't the only thing this movie lacked, it also needed more people. There were only 4 or 5 main characters throughout the entire movie.
The best part was the ship battles special effects, and an appearance by a former Stargate regular. My opinion is you will thank yourself for borrowing the movie not buying it.",1189814400,,826,4.783216783216783

It feels like a couple of small, private non-arc episodes of the show. I liked the production values, found everything ok (about the only odd thing was that B5 was very empty, but that was about it). The music was great, the effects were awesome, and the stories thought-provoking, though not earth-shattering.

As Delenn is to have said, ""Treasure these moments, for they will never come again"".  Well, the moment of the series has passed, and will never come again.  Given that, these two stories (particularly the Sheridan storyline) are remarkable in their truth to the sensibilities of B-5.

My sincere thanks to the writer, actors, and crew for echoing truly the tone of B-5, while telling new short stories with intimacy and grace.  No, of course no-one involved had their hand on the pulse as in the halcyon days of Seasons Two through Four.  Who could, after having put this work down after all of that time?!  Some of the dialog was trite or overly explanatory, but such moments were rare (blessedly so, when compared with ""Legend of the Rangers"").

2822967,4,B000PHX8RA,"Babylon 5: The Lost Tales is the first Babylon 5 story in several years. It is intended to be the first in a series of direct-to-DVD releases that focus on smaller, character-centered stories involving one or two characters from the Babylon 5 universe. The first release involves one story with Colonel Elizabeth Lochley, commander of Babylon 5 since the 5th season of the original show and another starring both President John Sheridan and the technomage Galen. An effects-heavy third story featuring Michael Garibaldi was pushed to the second DVD release due to funding issues related to reconstructing the entire special effects and sets from scratch. The two stories happen simultaneously and converge at the end, even though there is no connection between them other than the fact that Sheridan and Lochley meet up at the end.

Show creator and producer J. Michael Straczynski wrote and directed these stories, and he had complete creative control. Unfortunately, however, Warner Brothers was fairly limiting in the budget they allocated to this project, and advertizing for it has almost been nonexistent. It deserved much more. The stories are excellent and very intelligent, as is typical for Babylon 5. Lockley confronts someone who appears to be demon-possessed, claiming that God has confined demons to this sector of space so that they would remind later, space-faring humans that God does exist despite their encounters with aliens. As usual, the truth is mixed with lies, and what's really going on is something far more fascinating to me and a little surprising coming from Straczynski. My appreciation for the first story was much higher once it was done, and I look forward to watching it again with a friend who loves B5 once we have a working DVD player again.

The second story involves the technomage Galen once again appearing to President Sheridan, telling him to do something urgent that will prevent some terrible consequences in the future. The only problem is that what he has to do is something Sheridan feels a very strong moral compulsion not to do. He wonders if it's really necessary for him to do it. As is often the case with Straczynski's stories, the moral issues are carefully thought-out, and the twists in the storytelling are interesting. In the end, a lot less is clear about what Galen wanted than we were originally supposed to think. I was fairly impressed with the ending.

As stories go, they are well-written and thought-provoking. I had been worried that Straczynski's Bush Derangement Syndrome would influence these stories, but he wisely stayed away from bringing any of that in here. It doesn't have a lot of action, and it seems a bit short (70 minutes total for two stories, less than two 45-minute episodes would be). Even though the special effects are much better than the original series, it still isn't as good as it could have been if Warner Brothers had been willing to fund it based on the excellent evidence they already have of the fanbase who made past B5 products a success on DVD. But they didn't fund it well. I do think it's pretty good given a fairly low budget, as B5 always was. It's not terrible, but it's not cutting edge for the time, as the original had been. I enjoyed it overall, and it's among the better examples of intelligent B5 storytelling, so I recommend it highly to B5 fans who enjoyed the more intellectual stories who can deal with less action and special effects that could have been a little better. I look forward to future installments with other characters.",1189382400,7,3550,4.903494176372712

2822969,2,B000PHX8RA,"I was very disappointed in this release, Voices in the Dark. The format of two disparate short stories strung clumsily together was wholy unsatisfying. Much better would have been two separate lengthier releases, but as this is the first of a proposed series of single-character-centered short story explorations, I can understand the restrictions of a limited budget. I can say that this release offered a welcome visit with the characters and I do look forward to more.

What prompted the two star rating from me was mainly the first story, centered on Lockley. It was mediocrely penned and did not seem to fit within the B5 mythos. It also suffered from ridiculously overwrought camera angles and voice modulations. Obviously intended to heighten tension, they were instead unduly distracting. Furthermore, I was left feeling Tracy Scoggins was shortchanged in that story focus was split almost evenly between Lockely and the priest. While Lockely was the one to save the day, the feeling was a bit too deus ex machina to be satisfying.

The second story, focused on Sheridan with some nice supporting work from Galen, was better written, but still left me groping for more story at the end. In all, Voices in the Dark would have been much better had Straczynski chosen to expand Sheridan's short story into a novella, dropping the dubious Lockley tale for a more focused venture at a later date.

The special features are mediocre, but do offer a few laughs and insights into the new work. Overall, though, they are not novel enough to bring the rating up to three stars. Perhaps 2.5.",1189382400,4,1588,4.917910447761194

I think Seasons 3 and 4 were the pinnacle of the series, but thought The Gathering was actually pretty good, and even thought Crusade had some potential. This newest offering, however, is simply terrible. Star Trek: The Motion Picture had more action in it. It could have really been a radio play, and would probably have been better for it. The actors were largely wooden (with the exception of Galen), you rarely see more than two people together at any given time, the dialog was goofy, the jokes were cheap shots and lowbrow humor, and the stories were just plain boring. The CGI never looked better, granted, but as George Lucas said (and promptly forgot) a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing. Even given that, it still borders on the absurd. The scene of a future New York looks almost exactly like New New York in Futurama, which does nothing to lend credibility to the scene. The first vignette has roughly the plot of Exorcist 3, but isn't as good (which is saying something). The second exists almost exclusively to make a cheap joke about a reporter vomiting on herself, and offers next to nothing in content aside from this. The third is supposed to foreshadow the Centauri destroying earth. Despite the fact that Cartagia had no heir when he died, we're presented with a Centauri prince who is hinted to be his son, who practically spills his entire plan to assassinate Vir to Sheridan in an off-hand commentary, obviously meant to confirm what a threat he is supposed to be. I half expected him to say ""...and then I will destroy earth!"" at the end of his missive. He might well have worn a blinking sign that says ""Maniacal Villain!"" on it. He doesn't even get supervillain points, since he didn't wait until he had anyone in a deathtrap to reveal his plot, he just spills it. It was at this point I gave up on The Lost Tales. It was weak, low-brow humor, CGI fest at it's best moments, and was sad, pathetic, and just plain embarassing at it's worst. The only way I'd watch this again is if there was an MST3K version.

2822998,3,B000PHX8RA,"My rating out of 4 stars: 1.5 stars (part A), and 3 stars (part B).

As a long-time fan of the B5 series, as well as Crusade, and the movies In The Beginning and Call to Arms, I trolled the Web for a couple of weeks after the so-so reviews of this (and didn't trust the ""B"" grade at scifi.om), ultimately deciding to up this in my Netflix queue and take a chance. Briefly, this DVD  has two roughly 30-min. parts, starring (character-wise) Lochley/priest (part A) and Sheridan/Galen (part B).

First, the good: Given the state of technology now, about 10 years later, the effects look great; always wondered what the B5 cargo bay really looked like. (As the only real B5 ""money shot,"" you'll have a lot of time to study it.)

Better, part B is a fun time (really, just watch part B, is my recommendation); JMS's writing plays both to the characters (and actors), and also sends up several SF tropes in amusing ways. The pacing and dialogue is tight, and helps overcome the lack of apparent budgeting for any more than a few extras (2 Minbari, 1 human reporter, and absolutely no one wandering around otherwise. Is it too expensive to make more uniforms?) That said, this episode syncs up beautifully with the B5 universe, and handles the theme (not to give anything away) -- is one life worth the lives of billions -- with subtlety, and on a personal level. This is the stuff that helped build great B5 episodes (which were admittedly more fleshed out than this segment).

Episode A, I'd skip. It seems like a discarded fragment from Season 5 -- no ringing endorsement that (cough Byron cough) -- resurrected and stretched to thematically bookend part B, and to provide an excuse to pass some time on the station. (What, all the interesting characters departed? Well, yes.)

Worse, part A attempts to handle Big Issues with none of the subtlety of part A. As the episode beats to death, religion wanes as technology advances; we get it. But there's none of the deftness or humor JMS often brings to such subjects. As a B5 fan, I was thinking, What did all these encounters -- finding new races, the First Ones, and indeed the First One -- do to theology? Look back 400 years: religions are not stagnant institutions. Now go forward: where might we be? Instead, we get a monster episode which wouldn't have passed muster on Friday the 13th (the series). Oh for want of a B story.

Future B5 DVDs may involve Garibaldi, Londo, or the Telepath Wars. Given the potential to work existing B5 mythology into these, not to mention the fun just of watching these characters, that's a DVD (or 2) I would buy.",1188691200,,2599,4.576344086021505

Let it be what it is, an all-too-brief visit from some familiar faces, a little older, but still focused on the task of entertaining and making us believe in this city in the sky. Rather than a continuation of the shows themes, this is more theater, with lots of dialogue and a continuation of the remarkable writing that set B5 above most any other science fiction series. Only three familiar faces make their way into this short pair of stories, Sheridan, Lockley, and Galen, the techno-mage.

It looks like it was mostly shot in green-screen, with maybe 3 actual ""real"" sets, which undoubtedly kept production costs down, a concern that also may have limited the ""stars"" appearing. Overall quality is at least as good as the series, with only one backdrop looking fake. And while I do enjoy the writing, I would have given it 4 stars instead of 3 if the first of the two stories hadn't been QUITE so talky. Nonetheless, kudos to one of the finest talents in science fiction, JMS, and double kudos for bringing B5 back once again in this innovative DVD series. Look forward to more.",1188691200,,1377,4.694214876033058
2823000,5,B000PHX8RA,"A very good set of stories. The CGI effects are MUCH crisper. Though both tales are short I think they are worthy additions to the Babylon 5 saga.
The tributes to Andreas Katsulas (G'kar) and Richard Biggs (Dr. Franklin) were subtly worked into the fabric and touching.
The stories are driven, not by the CGI or the sets but by thoughtful writing.  I gladly recommend them to you.",1188691200,,380,4.588235294117647
2823001,3,B000PHX8RA,"In fine, watching -and therefore supporting- The Lost Tales is making a bet on the future. For the B5 fan, there is enough to be glad, even though satisfaction is on the thin side. One does not forget that if Sheridan is a centerpiece of the show, Lochley seemed to be a contrivance -for lack of Ivanova- and Galen, on the Crusade spin-off, was often dangerously close to histrionics. To be fair, though, neither Lochley nor Galen were really given the time to grow into full characters and they do belong in the saga.

The two Lost Tales may appear as negligible when compared with the existing B5 canvas and they do have a shoestring type of look, to the point that B5 usenet newsgroup users seem to have mistaken some basic but very real decor for CGI... However, The Lost Tales are much more Babylon 5 than the forced Legend of the Rangers which may have started as a B5 concept but somehow devolved into a B5:above and beyond which should not have been attempted. And B5 remains a large and complex world that could still grow.

The Lost Tales remind us that B5, contrary to most TV shows, genre shows included, is not built primarily on gimmicks (simple settings, clear characters with primary functions and -usually- one character flaw). At its best, the show offered the delightful delusion of complexity, the belief that the characters could indeed evolve into anything and the story with them.

As a tribute to this wealth of character and story creation,  the most interesting part of the DVD may be the vignette dedicated to  Richard Biggs and Andreas Katsulas who inhabited their characters in ways that clearly make them impossible to replace. It is because of them, and the convergence of works of the parties involved, that B5 had become what is was in its three middle seasons: a sleight-of-hand like any TV show, pretending to be more than it is, but a successful one, making you forget the strings and the puppeteers without resorting to artificial surprises or adrenaline-fueled rides.

Lost Tales is not equivalent to what should have been the Legend of Shadows. But it proves that B5 has a lot of life left in it, if only the studios could see it... and if cast issues can be resolved.",1188604800,3,2207,4.660668380462725
2823002,4,B000PHX8RA,"I loved -- and still love -- Babylon 5.  I think it's among the very best television science fiction.  I went into ""Lost Tales"" knowing that it wouldn't have the immediacy of the unfolding story the original series had, just because it's a couple of ""short stories,"" rather than being part of the ""novel.""  And, in fact, what we have here is something like a couple of Twilight Zone episodes.

That said, I really enjoyed it, particularly the second (and longer) segment with Sheridan and Galen.  Boxleitner and Woodward both fell right back into character, and their interaction was wonderful.  I enjoyed the first part of the story with Lochley also, but not as much.  That story felt a little more static -- and both stories suffered from not enough money for sets and extras.

But I very much hope that Straczynski gets to make more of these Lost Tales DVDs, and I'll be first in line to buy them if he does!",1188604800,2,912,4.552147239263804

2823005,3,B000PHX8RA,"This DVD is a disappointment. I regret buying rather than renting it. My only hope is that my buying it allows the next one to be far better.

As a lover of the original Star Trek, Dr. Who, and of course, Babylon 5, I don't expect movie quality special effects. For me the effects were fine.

The lack of people in the background was disconcerting. It seemed like a theatrical stage play. But understanding budget constraints, that can be tolerated.

What was disappointing were the stories. There is still the spark of JMS brilliance, but it is very rusty. The first story doesn't even seem to fit into the Bab 5 universe. The ""demon"" and the way the story unfolds seems more like a fan installment than the real deal. While I found the premise and conclusion interesting and logical, the story dragged and had little real tension. It should have been longer and been developed more.

The second story seemed more like a Bab 5 universe story. And any story with Galen with Peter Woodward playing the part is worth the price of admission. Frankly, he raises this to a whole new level. Without him, this would have been horrible. My problem with this story is in its execution. It is far too redundant. It could have been 10 minutes shorter and been exactly the same. The repeating and repeating again of lines became monotonous. It lacked the spark and edge I expected.

Bottom line, there is hope. I give JMS credit for getting this done. But for fans to stick with it, the next one better hit it out of the park. When you compare this to what the fan driven Star Trek New Voyages has done, it is clear that this was not up to par.",1188518400,2,1632,4.444816053511706
2823006,2,B000PHX8RA,"The two stories on this DVD were obviously produced inexpensively and bear little resemblance to the TV show. As a fan of Babylon 5 I feel cheated.

The first story takes Babylon 5's religious undertone and rams it in your face. It's more silly than entertaining or enlightning.

The second story is a little better, but would be more suited as a sub-plot in a regular episode than a stand-alone story.",1188518400,2,402,4.647887323943662

I rate this as a 4 and not a 5 because the overall production values are lacking. With only one major star and one minor star from the original series I felt something was missing. The reason I didn't give it only 3 stars is the behind the scenes and making-of material are excellent and, for those of us not paying close attention to Hollywood news, there is a new meaning for the phrase ""Beyond the rim.""

All B5 fans should pick this up but don't expect the same overall quality season 5 left us.",1188518400,,683,4.328125

2823030,3,B000PHX8RA,"It was great to hear that a new B5 was on the way and it was great to see the B5 universe rendered in upto date special effects. But the final veiwing was a little disapointing, the two segment format just did not give enough room to develop either story to a suitable degree. The budget restraints were clear to see with the interior of B5 being reduced to almost no sets at all and I guess I was expecting the full B5 as I enjoyed it in the series.
I understand that the producer prefer's the short story format but it did not work for me. Also a little disapointing was the lack of original cast due to the story lines chosen, budget restraints and unfortunatly the death of 2 leading actors. Bottom line is that this was a Babylon 3.5 and not a Babylon 5.
As a fan of B5 I will no doubt buy any future episodes but with a much lower expectation. The original series and movies are clearly the best ScFi made for TV and are now only being challenged by Battlestar Galactica and I prefer to remember the series as it was.

So should you get this DVD?, I think yes but don't expect the B5 you remember. But do support the project and maybe the studio will convince the producer to do a real movie in the B5 universe.

2823031,2,B000PHX8RA,"I love babylon 5. I was so excited to to see a new installment, but this latest edition seems like a weak attempt to make money off people like me.  It's just 2 new episodes.  It doesn't contribute anything to the overall story arc.  It just puts familiar faces in new situations and brings them to conclusion.  I thought the 1st half with the new female captain was somewhat silly.  A demonic posession episode?  Come on.  It had too many religious (Catholic mythology) overtones.

I'd rather see Strazynski make movies out of the novels that came after the series ended;  stuff about the psicorps, the technomages, Centauri Prime etc.  This is just a sad attempt to score a few bucks off us loyal B5 fans.",1188432000,,707,4.584

2823033,4,B000PHX8RA,"A couple of years ago I heard of a little project known as Babylon 5, memory of the shadows.  A projected full feature movie with the original cast of B5.  I read on the internet that all of the original cast members, including Mira Furlan, Bruce Boxlitner, AND Claudia Christiansan were going to be in it.

The story sounded promising.  Then a few months later I read the project was dead.  Just that, dead.

Being a B5 fan since accidently catching the final few episodes of the first season, I was saddened.  I have hoped for the return of this series with character development that exceeds other Sci fi shows (with the possible exception of Firefly).

Then I see this little jem in the rough.  I could not believe that somehow, B5 might rise from the ashes.  But here it was.

When I watched the movies, I was pleasantly suprised.  Yes they had signs of low budget, but they fit nicely into the cannon of the series.  The first story is pretty much one of the elements of the heart and soul of the original series.  The second one showed how much John Sheridan had changed.  As the young captain Sheridan, hearing that prince go on about grand fleets and battles, most likely would have pulled the trigger himself.  But instead, the older wiser Sheridan does something worthy of his wife, spares the life, and decides to take it under his wing.  The new John Sheridan that returned from Zha ha dum.

I think this little dvd shows great promise, I hope they can get the rest of the cast that haven't gone beyond the rim, to endevor into breathing some life into this great series...one last time.

All things do have to end, just not so soon.",1188432000,3,1646,4.4630872483221475
2823034,3,B000PHX8RA,"As we were watching the first story of these Lost Tales, and Tracy Scoggins was reading us page after page of exposition about what's going on, I was struck by something: the old Babylon 5 would never have done this. We would have seen the plot unfold, not be told about it. That would have been interesting. Listening to the story being told in what could very easily have been a radio play was not taking best advantage of the medium.

I can only assume that the problem here was budgetary constraints. The casting is so sparse, with each episode having only a small handful of characters (each episode basically has one primary character from the old cast, a bit part for another old cast-member, one or two ""guest stars"", and that's about it) and a similarly small number of sets. The sparse production I suspect just really limited what they could do - limited things too much, I think, and so we end up with episodes that have a ton of exposition and not enough action or interaction.

As a fan, I still enjoyed them as a diversion. They seem truer to the B5 mythos than Legend of the Rangers was, but the first story (featuring Scoggins) is a little heavy-handed, while the second one (featuring Boxleitner) is better. But both are just shadows of the past, sadly. Their relative averageness just serves to remind me how truly great a series Babylon 5 was. Maybe it's time to just go back and watch that again.",1188432000,,1417,4.53125
2823035,4,B000PHX8RA,"I can't believe some of you whiners call yourselves fans!!! I'm thankful that this simply exists and does not suck!! Yes, these 2 episodes aren't perfect, but what did you expect!!! I hope you didn't seriously expect the studio to give Straczynski the budget necessary to make an episode comparable to the best of seasons 3 or 4, did you? I'm sure he has the scripts to do so!!

While watching these 2 episodes PLEASE remember that what you are watching is AN EXPERIMENT!!! It's out there to ""test the waters"" more than anything else. The stuffed shirts that control the money could care less about the dedication of the fan base, the quality of the production, etc, etc, they ONLY care about the money...the PROFIT!! Look at what Paramount did to Star Trek for cryin' out loud!! A perfect example!! If we THE FANS make it successful there will be more, probably of increasing quality. If not, we have no one to blame but ourselves!!

As for me....I BOUGHT it...and was happy to!!! Was happy to fork over my $20 too!! And I'll tell you something else...the episodes were BETTER than I was expecting!! While I certainly wouldn't rank them in the top 1/3 of the show, I wouldn't rank them in the bottom either!! I would rank them right smack in the middle of the middle 3rd!! I enjoyed BOTH episodes and will have NO problem watching them again!! And, as others have mentioned, the special effects are outstanding!!

One thing for sure - I have spent my hard earned $$ on far worse!! I'm happy these 2 episodes exist; remember many of us sat through the god-awful Star Wars - The Phantom Menace SIMPLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF SEEING MORE OF A BELOVED STORY!!

So quit your whining and support what Straczynski is trying to do!!! That's the main reason I'm giving this 4 stars, the episodes themselves really only deserve an average 3 stars because that's EXACTLY what they are.....average Bab5 episodes!!

2823036,2,B000PHX8RA,"Sometimes things just have to end and stay ended no matter how much we hate it. Yes, Babylon 5 was one of the best series ever to come to TV, we miss it, we want more, we feel that its sequel Crusade could have been just as great if given a chance, and a couple of the movies were also up to the high standard of the series.

But then the fat lady should have sung -- and left us with our memories of a near-perfect, near-flawless series -- one to return to and watch on our tapes and DVDs and again enjoy and recall how great it was and how much we loved it. Better that than building up our hopes for more and then letting us down with this farce.

I gave it a couple of stars because I thought the actors did a fine job and didn't even appear to be struggling, in spite of having nothing to work with and nothing to do. Tracy Scoggins certainly deserves several gold stars for surviving one of the most boring scripts ever written -- endless drivel based on tacky theology. Bruce Boxleitner is, well, Bruce -- just as delightfully crusty Sheridan as ever and the only bright spot present, though equally inflicted with nothing but talk and a sweetly corny resolution as to what to do with the Centauri prince.

And where was the Babylon 5 station itself in all this? We got some beautiful outside shots of it, but inside? Bare blank nothing. This was supposed to be a big 10th anniversary shindig -- so where were all the people? There was nothing to indicate that a big glorious celebration was in progress. The Minbari ship was a little brighter and more colorful but again, hardly anybody was there.

2823047,3,B000PHX8RA,"When B5 was originally airing, it was the only space Sci-Fi show I watched at the time. Therefore, I had high hopes for this, but after watching it, I am merely greatly disappointed. The budget was totally spent on the matte paintings and CG F/X of the B5 Hanger and New York's Central Park scenes, but those hardly made up for the dull, ponderous story, weak acting, and overall low-budget appearance.

Strazinski (the Producer/Creator of b5) should have looked to Whedon's (Producer/Creator of Firefly) outstanding, bar-raising effort when converting Firefly to the big screen with Serenity.

I gave this 3 stars because, well, it is B5, one of my all-time favorite shows, and one to two stars would man that I hate it or dislike it... which, despite my great disappointment, would be too harsh, even for this meager effort. So, whilst I struggle to say I like it, I can't go so far as to say I dislike it. I am sure, however, that there will be plenty of fans who will be thrilled with this despite it's weaknesses, and more power to them. If there is another one after this, - and with this to go by, that remains a GREAT BIG, FAT IF - I will buy it, but if it isn't a significant improvement in story, cast, setting and all around quality, then that will be the last chance blown.",1188345600,,1285,4.487179487179487

2823052,3,B000PHX8RA,"Why 3 stars?  Firstly let me give you some background information about my B5 experience.  I discovered B5 by accident one night when my favorite show (DS9) was a repeat; unfortunately B5 was in its first season.  After a few minutes of derisive laughter I switched channels and found something else to amuse me.  Why the laughter?  Well because quite frankly up until then Star Trek was the only science fiction show that I was remotely interested in.  It wasn't until two years later that I happened on it again, this time I wasn't laughing and I didn't change the channel.  There was only three scenes left in this particular episode and B5 was in the later part of the 3rd season but boy, what an amazing three it was!  I found my self coming back the next week just to find out what would happen next.  I was hooked and have been an avid B5 fan every since.  That having been said I was pumped to find out that yet another movie was in the making (I own every episode/movie on DVD).  Being the cautious shopper that I am, I immediately came to Amazon to read the reviews once Lost Tales had been released.  I was disappointed with all of the low ratings and disbelieving of the 4 star ratings.  But on impulse I ordered it anyway.

1) I was very impressed with the special effects but at the same time I longed for the hustle and bustle of the station.  I missed the noise of the background crowd going about its business etc. I missed Delene and Londo, Vir and of course the good `Doctor Biggs' and G'Kar, not to mention Ivanova and Garibaldie.

2) The first tale featuring Tracey Scoggins was pure character driven.  There was no shooting, no fast camera moves, none of the things that would immediately say wow, look at me!  But you know what?  The story or as JS would say, the tale left an impression on me long after it was over.  I didn't feel like I was being preached at, the tale wasn't about spreading the `good news' (after all JS is an atheist).  It goes much deeper than that.  To me it's about man and his self proclaimed wisdom being shown that he may not be as wise as he thinks.  And too, it's about hope.  The hope that in spite of our arrogance we can still find that place where we can rise above our weaknesses and find the better part of ourselves.  B5 has never been just another sci-fi show and this tale proves it.

3) The second tale - I was happy to see John Sheridan/Bruce Boxleitner again.  Its funny but I looked at how much he's changed and I realized I've changed just as much.  I've never seen the evolution of a character so clearly as when I look at B5.  Although I'm also a great fan of the Star Trek universe, it's never (to me) come close to showing the characters in as much depth as B5.  Sure, it's always had the effects, the flash and some great stories but it's always lacked that something.  The same something that B5 delivered over and over again in the short five years it was originally on air.

In short (or long), if you get The Tales, don't come into it looking for a feature length movie with lots of action.  But instead consider it to be a brief glimpse into the lives of two of the many characters we grew to love.  Its kind of like JS decided to drop in and have a short visit and let us in on what's been going on since we last saw them. Also, there was a hint of a greater story in the works.  These, I think are simply tales within a bigger tale but only if they continue.  We can only hope.",1188259200,2,3456,4.230886850152905

However, as soon as it was over I was disappointed frankly.  While they were both solid sub-plots neither one of those felt as grand as tales usually told in the B5 universe.

I can only hope next time they steer away from this multiple story deal and go fro a full DVD length feature on the Telepath War, Sheridan's Son, what happened to Lennier after he tried to kill Sheridan, or something to that effect.  A real ending for Crusade.  Something the fans have been clamoring for not this ecumenical b/s or a lame premise based around Sheridan killing a guy who's innocent at the moment.",1188259200,,747,4.384057971014493

2823081,2,B000PHX8RA,"I absolutely love Babylon Five.  And that love has carried me through quite a lot of really poor spin-off attempts from the franchise.  I hung around for Crusade thinking it was going to improve but when it was cancelled I felt the same relief a person feels when a suffering loved one finds the release of death.  I tuned into Legend of the Rangers and felt like I had been kicked in the head.  What was going on?  Had JMS lost his touch?  But a few years later the tattered remains of my faith in his vision allowed me to be excited about the Lost Tales-- just enough to taste bitter disappointment yet again.

I can forgive the sparse budget that cut the number of sets, and actors (even extras) and action.  I could even pardon the long monologues.  JMS has done some great speeches in the past, but there was a lot of exposition monologues and moralizing that would have been vastly improved with editing.  But what insulted me the most was the plot of the Lochley storyline.  I won't provide any spoilers except to say that I am fine with exploring religion and spirituality in science fiction but that I prefer a lot more reason, skepticism, and science in my genre works and also a lot more ambiguity with the theological messaging.  I felt profoundly insulted by the whole thing.  The second storyline with Galen and Sheridan was a good deal more palatable, but was really just a ghostly echo of the quality show we remembered.",1188086400,3,1436,4.51937984496124
2823082,2,B000PHX8RA,"I was less startled at the execution--which wasn't as bad as one would think, even if the first tale made no sense--than I was at the appalling failure of this intended format: just what purpose will an anthology format serve if 70 minute episodes come out twice a year? Voices in the Dark simply doesn't have the aesthetic or narrative value to stand on it's own; it's simply a decent non-arc B5 episode, with no external value beyond that. If its intent is to serve as a means to morph the concept into a regular television program, I can sympathize--but this was wheel spinning with better CGI. If you're gonna stick with the Direct-to-DVD concept, JMS, Why not do a mini-season with 3-4 episodes covering the same arc?

One last thought: I returned to B5 recently for the first time since the original series run and found it interesting that where I once saw Seasons 3-4 as epic, I now found the technique rote and unimaginative; and I wondered if the credit--if any--always belonged to the visual effects guys, not JMS. Look,JMS can write some mean dialog, but his only plot device is war, his only characterization is stock archetype; even forgiving 'Call to Arms' as a TNT money grab, the guy was as dogmatic as the people behind '24' when it comes to using violence as a means of pace. That might have worked for me in high school--and I certainly was enamored with B5 then--but I'm not going to canonize is yet.

But having said that, and having seen 'Voices in the Dark', I'm inclined to urge JMS to go find another war to cover because it will certainly be more interesting, more watchable, more essential than this episode in superfluity.",1188086400,,1651,4.631399317406143

Each story only has a few characters acting on minimal or virtual sets. The first story is a tacky exorcist sort of thing that has no place in a scifi context. The second story, with Sheridan, is much better and almost worthy of the original show. Bruce B easily slips back into the role of Sheridan befriending a Centauri prince. I hope that the quality of the stories improves on following discs.

It was nice to see how one story and another did fit together, so I'm hoping the rest of this series will get produced and by the time its done we'll see a bunch of disparate pieces add up to much more than just the sum of their parts just like the original B5.

2823088,3,B000PHX8RA,"The purpose of the direct-to-DVD was posted at all the major B5 fan sites so I remain surprised at some of the comments by supposed internet-savvy reviewers.  Remember that first bare-bones double-sided DVD that WB put out with In The Beginning on it years ago? That was a *test* DVD to see if anyone was interested in B5 on DVD because the *suits* at Warner Home Video didn't think anyone would be interested in B5 on DVD. Because that first DVD sold well we then got all of B5 on DVD.

In 2007, The Lost Tales DVD is also a testing-the-interest DVD by Warner Home Video so the budget was very limited. You can't have dozens of extras and explosions all over the place if you don't have the budget for it. You also can't afford all the cast members to appear for cameos.  Now, *if* the Direct-to-DVD sells well, then the skeptics at WB will once again be shut up and *maybe* we'll get more DVDs.  The Lost Tales refers to unrelated short stories in the B5 universe that weren't big enough for a full episode.

BTW:  JMS' five year Babylon 5 story arc is completed.  The fifth year wasn't as good because JMS had to revise his storyline after Claudia Christian decided to leave.  Tracy Scoggins was called in at the last minute to fill a new role that had to be created by the loss of the Ivanova character. For addditional accurate information instead of misinformation posted in reviews, check out the many B5 web sites that you can Google.

We should also be aware that there is a group of JMS-haters out there who go from site to site posting negative information.

JMS said that these would be small non-arc short stories in the B5 universe. JMS also said that the first DVD would be a template for hopefully future DVDs.  The DVD is *not* a movie nor is it an *episode*.  Originally there were supposed to be three short stories but that had to be changed.

About Crusade: Crusade was *not* a cancelled series. What we saw were 13 random episodes that were produced before the production was shut down due to TNT's desire to get out of it's contract. Crusade was gone long before it was aired on television.

Now then...

I *am* disappointed like many others that the stories weren't that interesting but given the circumstances of starting from no production company, no office building, no sets, no CGI Library, no crew, etc. that you have to build a base and go from there.

Let's hope the *suits* from Warner Home Video can be proved wrong again.",1188000000,,2456,4.497747747747748

But I must confess to a night of disappointment and I only hope that future movies offer more of the ""good old stuff"". The DVD contains 2 stories, both pretty much unrelated and the first especially being very flat.

The first story is about potential demonic pocession and at the end of the 45 minutes the viewer is left saying ""yeah, and?"".....no excitement, no action, well, no nothing really....

The second story is a little more ""B5 of old"" as we know it with some action, effects etc. But while Sheridan makes constant references in the story to the other B5 characters like Londo etc, we do not see them. Presumably, they declined to participate in the film....

All in all the viewer was left a little ""lost"" and with the hope that future movies will somehow build a link to these first 2....but right now, as they are and as a stand alone movie, they do not really work and can only be seen as disappointing....",1187913600,2,1190,4.294642857142857

My reaction to the stories is mixed. The stories were quite a bit better than season one, but not close to the greatness of season 3 of B5. I loved the Arc storytelling that was B5. The first story totally seemed to miss that mark, and was clearly a stand-alone episode. As such, it was perhaps a 2.5 star out of five. I was never able to get into the Scoggins character. That the first story was so dependent on her character, seriously hurt it in my opinion. It's not that Scoggins is a bad actor, it's just that the character itself seems to be missing something. Having just been in one season of B5, it may be that the character missed out on the maturing process that the other characters benefited from.

The second story seemed to feed on some of the B5 history more naturally, and could easily be a setup for further Arc work. I see the character of the prince having so much potential, there is so much conflict here. Sheridan is indeed back, and Bruce seems to step into the character with ease. As for Galen... The character seems a bit forced in the story, like Peter had not played him for a while (which he has not). Somehow he seems more borderline psychopath/bully than mage, but perhaps thats me. Still, this was a story that was a pleasure, and one that satisfies the B5 cravings in me. Four stars for this one. Three stars overall.",1187827200,,1589,4.346801346801347

2823096,2,B000PHX8RA,"When it was announced that J. Michael Straczynski was making a series of direct to DVD sequels to ""Babylon 5"", there must have been happy anticipation among fans of his sci-fi universe. Since ""Babylon 5"" came to the end of its 5 year run, all we've had is the sequel series ""Crusade"", which got canceled after 13 episodes and the pilot TV movie ""Legends of the Rangers"", which the Sci-Fi Channel declined to buy as a series.

But the first disk of ""Babylon 5 The Lost Tales"" is a disappointment.

Placed 10 years after President Sheridan's departure from Babylon 5, and the founding of the Interstellar Alliance, it brings back three actors, Bruce Boxleitner as Sheridan, Tracy Scoggins as (now Colonel) Elizabeth Lochley, and Peter Woodward, reprising his role as the Technomage Galen from ""Crusade"" and the TV movie that set up that series, ""A Call to Arms"".

There are two separate 34 minute episodes on this DVD. The first features Lochley and a priest dealing with a demonic possession on the eve of the 10 anniversary ceremonies on Babylon 5, the second with Sheridan and Galen and a threat to the future of Earth, played out as Sheridan arrives for the festivities.

At one point in the beginning of the second episode Sheridan remarks that Minbari are minimalists. That could be said for the entire production. It is obviously low budget, without enough funds to pay for many actors. There are only three real roles in part 1, and three main roles with two short cameos (one by Lochley) in part 2. There are a few external voices and a couple of people walk by in a few scenes.

But instead of a people-filled Zocolo or C-in-C, all we get are a series of two person conversations in a few rooms. Occasionally there are three people in the conversation. Babylon 5 is supposed to be crowded, a quarter of a million people, all alone in the night. The place is empty here.

The space effects are limited but fine as computer graphics are cheap. Actors cost money.

The stories are also a bit thin. Each is only 34 minutes, shorter than the 40 to 45 minutes of an hour television show (without commercials). The demonic possession is not to be taken at face value in a universe filled with Shadows, Vorlans, rogue telepaths and other strangeness. The demon's story even sounds like a Christian take on the Shadow War of 1000 years ago.

Especially strange is Lochley's suggestion that calling in a priest is one of the weirdest things she has ever done on Babylon 5. The whole conversation suggesting that priests are rare and that faith has declined as humanity has entered space is exactly the opposite of what we have seen in the earlier series. In several episodes there are vital human religious expressions, and alien species from Minbari to Narn hold fast to their spiritual traditions.

One nice touch is when Lochley tells Sheridan that Dr Franklin has joined G'Kar in his journey beyond the rim. Since the actors playing those roles have died, they are indeed beyond, and we can only echo Sheridan's remark that he misses them.

So a disappointment, but still not to be missed for a fan of the Babylon 5 universe. We can only hope that later episodes in this series bring in a few more actors.",1187827200,5,3207,4.65017667844523
2823106,1,B000PHX8RA,"Was extremly dissapointed in these 2 ""movies"".
With all the hype I expected better.

2823107,3,B000PHX8RA,"Being a long time Babylon 5 fan I was quite excited to hear about the B5 world coming back to life, the DVD arrived and then I watched it. Yes it was kind of B5 and yes it was great to get a sense of the old place but alas that was all I got, just a ""sense of it"" rather than being immersed in the world of Babylon 5.
The fact that Joe would even make these after loosing two of B5's best cast members is pretty darn amazing in itself, but I do have to say that I expected more. Seeing Lochley again was not so great for me as I was never a huge fan of this character to begin with and Tracy Scoggins work here is not one of her best for the series. The story could have been better and the limited mini moviette vehicle hampers it further as just about the time things start to get going the episode ends. Well I for one was left with a feeling of ""what the?"".

However, the episode with Sheridan on the other hand harkens back to vintage B5 and really feels like we are on a roll again. The presence of Galen adds to the magic and gives a great glimpse of what could have been had the series continued or if Crusade had been given a reasonable chance to mature. I liked this episode much more though on minor gripe, I really did not care for the chairs used in the Minbari ship as it just looked way to cheap even for B5. Of course it would have been nice to see Delenn again if only for a few minutes, but perhaps that will come in a future episode, yes?

To think that Garibaldi and Londo may return to the screen plus more overview on the Telepath War puts a huge smile on my face and even though this first release is (in my opinion) not up to par with what has come before in the B5 universe, I think its only fair to assume that once Joe's gets his legs with this concept that we could be treated to some wonderful mini glimpses of the Babylon 5 universe that would be more than worth the cost of admission.
So was it worth the money? Yes more than not I feel it was, though to be honest I am clearly a B5 packrat and will buy the next installment. My last suggestions, pull in some of the old B5 directors, get Harlan Ellison back on board, take more risks and keep this idea going as we have all been sleeping in light now for way to many years and its time to come back from the Rim and find out what's been going on!",1187827200,2,2328,3.961620469083156

2823113,5,B000PHX8RA,"It's like finally going home!

I loved how the beginning starts so sad.. so sad.. that a friend told me he turned it off before the beginning credits finished.

But THEN! that's when it all begins.. JMS grabs the calendar and rolls back the years like on the old Star Ship Enterprise Chronometers.. faster and faster into the past.. the visuals are stunning!

Buried like treasure.. into the past the real stories begin.. and with a hint that perhaps the past isn't really as buried as we thought.. and ""There are Ways.."" in which what was may never be? A hint perhaps that the End of the B5 station was not as certain as it seemed? or seems?

It had a feeling like JMS was exploring possibilities.. how do you march forward when two of the brilliant cast members have passed on? He did it.. he really did..

Make no mistake this isn't like Legend of the Rangers, or Crusade.. this is 100 percent Christopher Franke charged all original Babylon 5 with updated visuals.

Perhaps the eyes of some of the reviews have aged but the FX serve the story, not the other way round. And even then its remarkable how well the new visuals dovetail with the originals.

Can't rate the open credits.. ""After"" the destruction of the B5 station end the beginning..of the Beginning! you'll be pleasantly surprised.. the End is only where it all starts. All we need is Zathras throwing the switch.. and hang on.

I don't know about anyone else but more than a heart string got tugged when there was Kosh once again.. a future storyline? I can't wait.. can't wait.

The stories.. well the first is so good.. you have to watch it again and again.. layer upon layer of meaning.. just like the originals! The dialog will knock your socks off. Was it Shakesphere.. ""More in Heaven and Earth than imagined in your Philosophy?"" Apparently JMS found room for both!

The first story will be relevant a year from now or 100 years or more.

The second story was classic Babylon 5, a bit more traditional, easier to grasp.. I lost myself feeling as if it were 1997 all over again and we were still puzzling over the motivations of the shadows.

As for the casting, very well done, of the first guests the delivery of the dialog was immensely important, and the gentlemen did it justice. It was beneficial to constrain the casting to a single recognizable original cast member and use the new.. use the unfamilar so you didn't know where the story was going.. would they survive the episode?

As for the second.. I like the updated Centauri look.. quite menacing.. and Galen was just a joy.. played purely borderline evil. I don't know how JMS does it.. is Galen good, bad, malevolent, or just plain insane?

When the curtain fell.. and the lights came up.. I was left feeling genuinely satisfied.. this was ""True"" ""Real"" ""Genuine"" Babylon 5..

I loved Crusade, and liked Legend of the Rangers.. but they strayed.. they went in new directions defiantly.. Babylon 5 still had stories to be told.. and this just slid right into that space. It's well coordinated and orchestrated.

Someday.. maybe.. Crusade will be completed in a fashion similar to this.. but this is Babylon 5.. its the real deal.

So many stories left.. the Vorlons left behind.. Vir Cotto's reign.. Lennier's trials.. Marcus Cole.. Quantum space.. and.. if the past influences the future.. what happens when time travel into the past lets the past influence the future.. put it this way, if two particles can be quantum entangled across space.. could they be ""across time"" in both directions?

Oh.

Did I say I highly recommend this movie for B5 fans and people totally unfamilar with B5.. its a good movie and a great buy.

The main plot ended with season 4 and the genious JMS made fantastic endings for both plots. But he couldn't stop - every good story should have an ending.

So there was season 5 which wasn't that bad but couldn't catch up with former plots. There also were some interesting movies from which ""In the beginning"" clearly stands out. After that JMS tried another spin-off in the b5 universe which I liked because of new charakters. But I lasted some 10+ episodes. Instead of a dignified stopping he tried Legend of the rangers and this one.

We had two very weak, more Star Trek than Babylon 5 plots which had be left apart. No sign of another epic plot. We again have a new spaceship typ and hyperspace isn't enough.

Quality is getting more and more bad. JMS, please stop! I would really appriciate a dignified ending of the B5 story.

This is a perfect jewel, obviously, yet cleverly, done, on a very tight budget. The common theme is a spiritual theme worthy of warrior priests, or technomagi, and that is to see the Light in the Darkness, to resolve the false duality be seeing unseen aspects hidden in the duality before you.

Allow a computer-controlled Star Fury to kill a prince, who will one day run the next Centari Empire, or try to make his dreams compatible with your visions of a common destiny, a destiny much greater than he could imagine elsewhere?

Scoggins has a quiet beauty, rather like an American Catherine Deneuve, and she gives a marvelous soliloquy at the end of her dealing with Satan; again, on her terms, and not the false duality offered by the Adversary.

Her point of view, like Boxleitner's as Sheridan, reflect Straczynski's strongest held belief; that our true home is among the stars, and we shall have to see the world around us, and in time, ourselves, in a much greater, grander frame of reference than we can now imagine.

We knew that going in.  JMS has said so, online, ever since this project was announced.  It's not what we're used to with respect to B5, & it's not what I prefer, BUT it IS what WB would finance, & what JMS would do at this time, after the deaths of John Sekka (Dr. Kyle), Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar), Tim Choate (Zathras) & Rick Biggs (Dr. Franklin), & with so much other stuff on JMS' plate (e.g. A-List feature films, etc.).

JMS didn't have much to work with.  WB lost 100% of the CGI & had very little of the original wardrobe, sets & props available.  Also, this was a ""test-the-waters"" DVD (1st run eps. Direct-to-DVD), & the budget was obviously low, w/100% of the payback to come from DVD sales.  With no time or budget to rebuild the old B5 sets, they had to do most of the sets virtually via green screen.  Also, they had to go to the fan community to get CGI to use as a starting point, and for some wardrobe pieces.

This didn't have a series startup budget, yet some people seem to have expected traditional B5, with full sets, props, wardrobe, cast, & an arc.  Their disappointment is the result of unrealistic expectations.

Re. the two eps. on the DVD, I thought the acting was top notch.  Bruce & Peter were great, Tracy was good, & the guest actors (Alan Scarfe [Father Cassidy], Teryl Rothery [ISN reporter], Keegan MacIntosh [Vintari], & Bruce Ramsay [Burke] were all very good.  The space CGI was superb.  The interiors, though, didn't quite feel right.

4 stars.  1 star for the distracting, perpetually tilting camera work in Story #1 prison cell scenes.  0 stars for WB budget & archiving of the 1993-1999 B5 resources.  Still, I'm glad that WB financed this project, & hope to see many more, bigger budget, B5-TLT DVDs in the future.

If this is the bare-bones beginning for a series of Lost Tales, then fine; everyone go out and buy it to show WB that Joe should continue. No Delenn, no Kosh, no G'Kar, no Garibaldi, no Londo, no Vir -- this is a serious handicap to the small, personal stories that the Lost Tales purport to be. Why? Personal interaction is intrinsic to the lifes of Lochley and Sheridan. It is impossible to believe that either of these stories happened because of the lack of it; constant interaction was at the heart of the series.

The dialogue is written to enlighten the audience as to what really happened, so it ends up being long winded explanations between the characters. The worst such scene has to be the one between Lochley and the priest.

I agree it's time to put Babylon 5 to rest if the budget won't allow the producers to make decent movies in the future.",1187568000,4,473,4.436781609195402

We were both very excited to see this new offering, but unfortunatley it falls short in terms of plot and action. The special effects were great, but not used to the fullest (lack of action scenes). These two interwoven episodes just never seemed to go anywhere....you were left at the end, saying, is that it? Granted, something B5 is better than nothing, but if these direct DVD releases are going to succeed, they need more meat. For what it's worth, they were far better than the Legend of the Rangers release, maybe because we got to see some of the real B5 cast.
Let's hope the next set is a stronger release.",1187481600,4,707,4.446153846153846
2823122,4,B000PHX8RA,"This direct to DVD effort is an attempt to appease the legions of fans, like me, who have been clamouring for more Babylon 5 (""B5"").  As such, it should be viewed more as a proof of concept than a full-fledged return to the good old days of B5.  If this DVD sells well then, hopefully, the budget will get bigger, and the stories more complex in future offerings.  Viewed from this standpoint, this DVD succeeds in whetting the appettite for more.

The budget constraints are very obvious in this initial offering.  Only three of the main actors from the original series participate, the sets are very spare, and the plots fairly simplistic.  B5 had a great ensemble cast, but unfortunately, two of the actors who created some of the most memorable characters, Andreas Katsulas (""G'Kar""), and Richard Biggs (""Dr. Franklin""), passed away, and are no longer available to participate.  The starkness of the scenes is somewhat disappointing, but understandable when you realize that new sets had to be built from scratch.  In addition, there are never more than three poeple in a scene at any one time, giving it the feel of a play rather than a television series.

Despite all the limitations though, it is a good first effort, and one which I hope will be followed by more installments.  I hope more of the original cast will participate, and the budget will get bigger.  I sincerely hope that one of the networks decides to get involved and throws some serious money so that this project can prosper and bloom to its full potential.  Considering the many successful science fiction shows on various networks such as SciFi's Battlestar Galactica, USA's 4400, and NBC's Heroes, I hope someone will see the potential for this and pick it up.

2823125,2,B000PHX8RA,"To put it bluntly, the DVD was disappointing.  The effects that combined live action and CGI were low-budget and second-rate, the plots were two dimensional, and the lack of the better known characters glaring. Only one major player (Bruce Boxleitner) and one minor player (Tracy Scoggins) are back.  The rest are MIA.  No Delenn. Foxy Lyta? Nary a mention. Londo? Nope. Vir? Ditto. It's has more the feel of  ""I have to pay some bills, so let's milk some money out of the fans"" then anything else.

Bruce Boxleitner aged well in the past decade.  Not so Tracy Scoggins.  Nitpicky, but true.

There are three menu options for the episodes.  So I assumed there were three  episodes. Nope, only two.  Two menu options play the same episode.  Poor menu design there!  More time was spent on the ""behind the scenes"" stuff than the episodes.

The plots - let's call them what they really are - ""The Exorcist Meets B5"" and ""Mullet Centauri Boy"" are both pretty lame - not up to the standards of the series.  And talk about a snail's pace?  I've seen more action in a slide show!

Was the show on a budget? Obviously.  But a good story would have carried the day.  Great SFX would have helped.  This DVD had neither.",1187395200,5,1209,4.534883720930233

2823127,5,B000PHX8RA,"I loved being able to revisit the world of Babylon 5. The acting, costumes, sets and effects were all vintage B5. The new actor (the Centauri prince) was very good, and the extra material, about the making of the DVD, were quite amusing. I can only imagine how amazing a sock puppet version of B5 could be. :-)

I was a bit disappointed in the first story, about ""a being whose presence makes the B5 freeport the crossroads between heaven and hell"" because it felt like it was ""cheating"". I don't want to say more to avoid giving away spoilers, but it didn't feel consistent with the B5 universe.

Admittedly the budget was clearly quite tight, but that's all you can expect with a 'direct to DVD"" release (which makes less money than a feature or tv show). And, to be honest, B5 was always struggling to make a big show on a small budget, so the sets, etc., were always ""just good enough"" so this didn't bother me at all.

On the whole, though, I really enjoyed the DVD, and I think that they did a great job producing it within a tight budget, and I hope that they continue to produce these DVD's. I look forward to seeing each DVD with a few stories about specific characters, as a chance to get to know them better.",1187395200,,1219,4.337719298245614
2823128,2,B000PHX8RA,"I'm guessing that if you are reading this, you were a big fan of the Babylon 5 t.v. series, like I was.  And also like me, you were hoping this would be a welcome addition to a fantastic adventure.  Unfortunately, after watching this DVD, I came away with a sense of being ripped off.  Don't get me wrong.  I liked seeing the characters of Sheridan, Lochley and Galen again.  But the stories were kind of mundane.  I don't think they would have even made a good t.v. episode let alone a separate DVD.  I won't bore you with the details of the two short stories.  You can get that from the other reviews.

It wasn't until I checked out the special ""Features"" on the DVD and saw ""Memorials"" that I realized why this DVD was so lacking.  I had not heard that both Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar) and Richard Biggs (Dr. Stephen Franklin) both passed away!  In the DVD, theirs absences are explained by the fact that both are ""exploring beyond the rim"".  A nice touch.  But if this DVD was to be the first in a series, I don't see how that can be done with the deaths of the actors who played two major characters of the series.  I guess that would be like trying to revive the original Star Trek series without Dr. McCoy and Scotty.  It just wouldn't be the same.  That's the way I felt after viewing this DVD.

By all means, any Babylon 5 fan should see this DVD.  But either rent it or try to get it at a bargain price.  But don't pay the $17 I paid for it.",1187308800,5,1448,4.181159420289855
2823129,1,B000PHX8RA,"I was living in Japan when Babylon 5 premiered, but I begged and pleaded with friends to send videos as the series progressed. B5 came out about the same time as Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and naturally there was a lot of talk about Straczynski trying to latch onto DS9's coattails. I believe that's pretty far from the truth - not only did the original B5 series aim to end the story after 5 seasons (unlike the Star Trek franchise which keeps things going as long as possible), it had a much more involving set of political sub-plots. Sure, you had to watch the show from start to finish, but that's how a great series is made IMO. Otherwise, the writer(s) need to try and tell a compelling story in 46 minutes of airtime.

The end of the B5 series left us with a sense of completion. The story was done, and we even got a glimpse of a distant future in which (as the B5 fans expected), this really was a time of great change.

Now it's ten years later. Enter Babylon 5 - The Lost Tales. The first story arc, in which Captain Lochley finds herself faced with (oboy, here we go) the arch-demon Asmodeus, is given a grand total of about 33 minutes to resolve. Just to be clear, this story essentially proves Christianity's version of Heaven, Hell and by necessity the various demons, angelic host etc., and gets resolved pretty much in the first half hour. That's an hour and a half faster than it took Fathers Merrin and Karras to exorcise Linda Blair!

The second story arc brings ex-B5 Captain, now-President Sheridan back to the space station, ostensibly to attend a celebration of the Interstellar Alliance. Techno-mage Galen shows up to warn Sheridan that the Earth of the future will be destroyed should Sheridan not act in the present to kill a one-day-to-be Emperor of the Centauri Republic. This grand arc of a morality tale to save the future earth while maintaining that which separates good from bad, takes up the rest of the running time, about 45 minutes.

While the stories have some potential, it's really hard to understand who could have thought this project was worth developing and producing. Two unrelated stories stuck together and only three of the original cast appearing. And I'm being generous here. I'd say only one original cast member - Bruce Boxleitner as John Sheridan - but technically Tracy Scoggins (Lochley, final season) and Peter Woodward (Galen, 3 episodes? 2?) were in the original series. Sparse sets, not to mention sparse actors (a total of six in the entire cast, including the lead characters!) create a show that is uncomfortably devoid of the character interplay that made the original B5 shows such great entertainment.

Don't get me wrong, I consider the original Babylon 5 series to be one of the finest science fiction shows ever produced. I own all the DVD sets as well as the DVDS of the pilot as well as the movies, and once every year or two I give the whole series another watch, from start to finish. It's only because of that love for the show that I bought ""The Lost Tales"" at all. And if I could wish for anything, I wish I'd never watched it - this has cheapened the wonder of the original series. Missing the fantastic ensemble cast, missing the scale of the original and most of all missing the polish of the original, this 'return to Babylon 5' has little of merit, if anything. This isn't a return to B5, it's a faded ghost of B5.",1187308800,7,3396,4.569786535303777

I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT JMS IS TRYING TO RELEASE THESE EPISODES AS A PRELUDE TO SEE IF SAY THE SCIFI CHANNEL WHO I BELIEVE OWNS THE SHOW FOR THEIR NETWORK MIGHT PICK IT UP AS A NEW SERIES.  ANYTIME YOU CREATE A SCIFI SHOW, YOU HAVE TO CREATE CHARACTERS, THE HISTORY, MYTHOLOGY AND SO ON. WITH BABYLON 5, ALL OF THE MENTIONED ARE ALREADY IN PLACE.

The stories in question are OK -- it was great to see Sheridan again, and the resolution of the issue with Cartagia's son was interesting, too -- but without seeing where the story goes, it loses something.

Am I glad I did?  Sure.  Am I thrilled with this release?  Not so much.  I've given this 3 stars because it's good rather than great.

JMS still writes decent dialogue.  That's a good thing, because that's pretty much all this is.  Sure, B5 looks spiffy with up-to-date special effects, but it seems that they really didn't bother to cast any extras.  In the TV show, B5 always ebbed and flowed with the various people going about their business; it felt alive.  This B5 feels like it was not only shot on a sound stage, but actually SET on a sound stage.

Bruce Boxleitner did a fine job reprising his role, and did so without as much of the overacting he occasionally brought to the original show.  Tracey Scoggins has aged noticeably since season 5, but it seems like the she was made up and shot to make her appear to be little-changed since the end of the show; a trick which doesn't actually fool the viewer, but is instead somewhat distracting, to the point where I can't even remember her acting.  Peter Woodward has certainly remembered how to play Galen, and he excelled at bringing about both Galen's darker side and sense of humor.  The rest of the cast does a sufficient to excellent job.

The extras included wonderful memorials for Andreas Katsulas and Richard Biggs.

I can't really fault JMS, though. From my understanding, the DVD was supposed to be three 30-minute segments, but for some reason, JMS was forced to do two 40-minute segments instead. Naturally, the stories will suffer a little from being dragged out. Mr. Kindall complained about the lack of known characters, but JMS pretty much told us in the beginning that's the way it would be. He said each story would focus on a single character, and they did. I was actually kind of surprised Galen had such a large part.
I liked the references to G'Kar and Franklin being 'Beyond the Rim' together. I thought that was a nice touch.
My only real complaint with the thing was the storyline of the Lochley segment. That plot would be fine as a B-plot, but as the focus of the story it was a little to Satanic for me.
I hope the bad and mediocre reviews don't cause the cancellation of this DVD series, because I think it has potential and I would like to see more, maybe even a few segments featuring more of the Crusade cast or some of the Legend of the Rangers cast.

The characters came alive, they were my friends, my enemies and in some cases, loved.  Delenn and the entire Minbari universe were my ideal of a civilization.  At least a sci-fi civilization.

The Lost Tales was like visiting an old friend for me.

I also thought it moving that as the movie began it ended where Season 5's Episode, Sleeping In Starlight, where the ships are leaving as Babylon5 is decommissioned, and G'kar's voice is speaking, and time is reversed back 10 years and we have a chance to see John Sheridan again.....His relationship with the Techo-mag, Galen.

I so wanted to love this release. But despite fabulous effects sequences and good acting it's all talk and no action. It was nice to see my favorite characters again. But they spend all their time talking about what the could or might do and mere seconds doing anything at all.

On the plus side, the production values are superb. This ""enhanced for widescreen TVs"" DVD looks amazing on my 50"" hi-def plasma screen. It looks almost as good as actual hi-def HD DVD movies. This disc is as good as any standard-def DVD will ever be.

Another disappointment is the content to cost ratio. This release costs more than double any other B5 release. And it's nearly six times more expensive than any of the 22 episode seasons. Here's some examples of what I mean.

$17 /  72 minutes = 0.23 - Lost Tales
$15 / 132 minutes = 0.11 - Legend of the Rangers
$48 / 471 minutes = 0.10 - The Movie Collection
$38 / 960 minutes = 0.04 - Any 22 episode season
$48 / 576 minutes = 0.08 - B5 Crusade - 13 episode series

From what I'd heard, I was envisioning something more along the lines of Sin City, with several 'episodes' linked together with a common narrative. I liked B5 from the first episode, but this DVD feels like a blatant rip-off of that audience. It just isn't worth the money, and buying it will only encourage more of the same. If they do more episodes (especially if they are halfway decent), and release them all as a DVD, maybe that will be worth watching (and buying).",1186876800,7,826,4.398692810457517
2823158,5,B000PHX8RA,"Before I review of J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon 5: The Lost Tales recently released directly to DVD, I want to say a word about Babylon 5 (B-5). Yes, I am a fan. I started watching at the prompting of a co-worker who has since moved on to bigger and better things in the service of our country. I watched, and I was intrigued. My first impression was not entirely positive. I thought that it was sci-fi on the cheap, and knee-jerk reaction to Star Trek: Deep Space 9, a show I was back then getting into, Trekkie that I was and continue to be. Some of the wardrobe and the makeup seemed to me exaggerated and ridiculous. This Londo Mollari character, for example, seemed to me out of the court of Louis XIV and this notion of a ""republic"" led by a monarchic emperor seemed to me contradictory. Yet...there was something about it...and it was the story.

Like Mr. Straczynski has said many times before, B-5 has a beginning, a middle point, and an end. It was a story meant to be told in 5 years. What a story it was. I think it was one of the most intelligent sci-fi shows ever made. Nothing was lost in the dialogue and the characters, they were human, even the aliens, each one extraordinarily gifted and profoundly flawed. They all meshed together and each character grew from their mutual interactions and it was a joy to see.

B-5 was a morality tale, a fight of darkness against the light, of good versus evil; even those who represented evil had a dark aura and those who stood for evil and conflict were able to make a plausible argument for the morality of their actions.

B-5 was deeply spiritual too. A strange work, deeply respectful of all religions and spiritualities, but particularly of Catholicism; a work that has come out from a declared atheist. Straczynski treats religion in general, and Catholicism in particular, with the utmost respect. Several B-5 episodes have a clear Catholic subtheme, for in B-5's universe, the Church survives and still has something to say, unlike in Star Trek and other shows, where religion has been subsumed into a vague mysticism tinged with ""spirituality,"" the thing Hollywood wants us to swallow in order to grow from ""superstition"" and ""fundamentalism"" into the light of ""tolerance"" and ""openness."" Phoey!  I thank God - because there is a God - for Straczynski, a living example proving than an atheist doesn't have to be a sophomoric, pompous jerk towards religion and believing people, that at least one can treat the subject with respect. Eat that, Dawkins, Harris, et al.

In many instances, Catholics have been heroes in B-5, always portrayed in a most positive light, unafraid to face the deep of questions posed by a Universe that is very, very big. Catholic allusions are also galore. Which takes us to these two episodes bundled in this Babylon 5: The Lost Tales DVD. Once again, good faces evil.

The stories are set ten years before the series finale. In the first episode, Over Here, Colonel Lockley, B-5's commanding officer, sends for a Catholic priest to face a a new evil at the station, the kind that only a Catholic priest is qualified to face. What will that be? I can tell you, but then I would spoil it. I will say this: the story resonated with allusions to C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy.

In the second story, Over There, John Sheridan, former B-5 commander and President of the Interstellar Alliance (I.A.), heads to B-5 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the I.A. But then Galen, the technomage, shows him a future in which Earth is destroyed by a sneak Centauri attack, led by a future Emperor who is now Sheridan's own guest. The young man is untested, and he could go either way: he could become a genocidal sociopath but he also shows a surprising openness to good and kindness. What will Sheridan do?

Let me finish by saying this: I love Star Trek, and I own some of the movies, and at least one of the ""fan continuum"" DVDs. But I own the entire B-5 series, the made-for-tv movies and now this one. I find them intelligent, challenging, and delight to watch. If you haven't seen the B-5 series, that's OK, you don't have in order to understand what's going in Babylon 5: The Lost Tales. Buy them, and get your friends to watch them. You won't be disappointed. And I hope that there is more to come from the mind of J. Michael Straczynski and the Babylon 5 universe.",1186876800,,4355,4.6175710594315245
2823159,4,B000PHX8RA,"There are various reviews of this product with ratings across the board.  My four star is from being a fan of B5, any way it is dished out.

Here is what I would say to other fans of Babylon 5:  if you are the kind of fan that demands evey screen minute of a favorite show be amazing, you should not buy this DVD.  It would be a tall order, even for JMS at his best, to live up to repeating what was accomplished by B5 at its best.

Now, if you are a fan that can find delight in some clever writing, or a certain character you enjoy, or the look and feel of effects for a show...then you will most likley find delight with this DVD.  It is a chance to see Bruce Boxleitner and Tracy Scoggins, the B5 Universe and expereince some good old fashioned JMS character driven writing again.

This is not meant to be some blaze of glory return of B5 movie.  I took the time to watch the extras and JMS himself says that these tales are going to be much more chatacter centered than an attempt to re-ignite a space opera like the The Shadow War.

Now, a reflection from the business side.  Small, character driven also means lower budget but this first DVD is also a test from Warner Bros.  If it sells and there is demand, I guarantee the following DVDs will get bigger in scope.  Entertainmnet is a business after all so you can consider this a testing of the waters with the fan base by Warner Bros.

I'm glad I spent the money -- I hope you will spend it too.  Consider it a modest investment in your being entertained.  Because if we fans can justify a larger budget from Warner Bros. on the forthcoming tales, I think JMS is ready to take us on one heck of a ride.",1186790400,2,1662,4.133956386292835
2823160,2,B000PHX8RA,"In the movie ""A Mighty Wind"", there was a song that mentions all these allusions to moving but what the song is actually about is not going anywhere at all.  After watching this DVD, I felt it perfectly exemplified this movie.  It was 72 minutes of people sitting around and not doing anything.  I suppose that one of the problems with coming out with something like this is there is no way to achieve the overall story arcs and Byzantine intrigue that were the cornerstones of the original series, which had five years in which to do so. But I would have expected at least something to at least happen.  Maybe they will come out with a series of these episodes and construct some story arc through that mechanism, but the amount of money it is going to cost a consumer to find out whether that works or not just isn't feasible.  I've read that there will be another one that comes out, and like the good B5 fan I am I will probably buy it in the hope that it is much better than this one.  I enjoyed seeing some of the B5 characters again, but I wish their stories had been more interesting.",1186790400,4,1092,4.302439024390244
2823161,4,B000PHX8RA,"It's hard writing this review.

I've been a fan of B5 as long as anyone so I was looking forward to this DVD very much. I can't say that I was disappointed but at the same some of my fond memories were shaken a bit. After viewing this DVD I was left wondering if this really is the old B5 show I had grown to love.

Other reviewers have hit the nail on the head on a number of aspects. There is a very shoe-string budget feeling to the DVD as there are hardly any extras anywhere and the fact that there are only three of the old characters there (well, two, really, b/c Galen was never a big part of the original storyline if you count out Crusade). Also, this certainly would have been a classic ""filler"" episode in the original series and both stories would have been combined into one episode.

Also, B5 never looked better. The visuals are truly amazing and one thing that excites me about the possibility of other DVDs is that we'll get to see more of the other homeworlds. In many ways it's a shame that this technology didn't exist 10 years ago, although it should be said that the original show was never lacking for effects. What really bothers me though is that it's virtually ALL CGI and instead of the bustling feel of B5 from the show the station felt quiet and totally deserted. Was that intentional? Finally, I wasn't a big fan of the constantly moving camera in the first story so I hope if there are more DVDs whoever does it next will direct better.

So it is very surprising that after 10 years the weakest aspect of the the DVD would be the stories. Sure, not everything can be about the Shadow war and the two stories we get are very much classic B5 but, again, they would have been B-plots in arc episodes. They're interesting but THIS wasn't what B5 was about.

So why give it 4 stars? B/c there's a ton of other great stuff on the DVD. Interviews with cast and ""fireside chats"" w/ JMS are excellent. The memoriams for Katsulas and Biggs are very moving too. And the truth is, the show is over and I find it hard to punish JMS with anything less than four stars when he didn't have G'Kar/Londo to play off each other, didn't have Garibaldi and Ivanova around... considering what he had to work with, he actually did a great job.

But that said I'd still rank this DVD below either of the four stand-alone movies. Given that almost a decade separates them it really pains me to write this.",1186790400,,2412,4.325221238938053
2823162,1,B000PHX8RA,"If you love Babylon 5 and the memories of it, stay away from this DVD. To say that it had no point would be as pointless as the DVD. Keep out.

2823163,4,B000PHX8RA,"More, more, more. The more B5 the better.

Just be aware, these are NOT full blown episodes or movies. These are short stories, single plotline tales on a smaller scale. They have subjects that are pure Straczynsky - moral dilemmas that should provoke thought and discussion, without the distraction of the shadow war.
Think of seeing a video of just Garibaldi trying to get his package from the post office, or Ivanova meeting with her ""Uncle"" and reconciling with her father's death as stand alone short stories.",1186704000,,514,4.908045977011494

This must be the modern definition of low budget.  Barely any actors, almost no sets, just green screens and two stories which are the equivalent of average to bad episodes in the middle of a regular season.  I rated this with a generous 3 starts just because one more time I get the same sense of sadness watching Sheridan walk towards death that I felt while watching the end of the series many years ago.  Also, I gave it 3 stars to recognize JMS courage to continue forward and trying to revive the story in some form or another.  Still, base on the last two attempts, I think is time to let it go or bring someone new to become the driving creative force behind B5.",1186704000,,846,4.153374233128834

The two stories on the DVD are very well written and reflect some of the other thoughtful tales in seasons 2 - 4 (forget season 5).  BUT... here are the negatives:

1.  Not enough story content for the money.
2.  Only a few characters from the series were actually in the story.
3.  Cheap production... but the CGI was very good.

If you are a die hard B5 fan... buy it.  But be aware that this is only a ""shadow"" of B5's fomer self.",1186617600,,552,4.037037037037037
2823177,5,B000PHX8RA,"The Lost Tales offers us a new look at the babylon 5 universe after a long time of fans asking.  This is truly a monumental undertaking because it's the first time a quality presentation has been brought to the straight to dvd market.  The future of science fiction could really go toward this innovative format if this works out (buy the disc!).  Babylon 5 has always been ahead of the curve in terms of its innovative storylines and technology, and this DVD is no different.

A lot of people came into this expecting some sort of grand action piece, and that's definitely the furthest from what Babylon 5 is supposed to be, and also what this disc is.  The concept proposed to the studio was that TLT would be an anthology series, a series of short stories if you will that focused around individual characters in order to give the characters more background and depth.  It's really cool and well done from a writing perspective, and you have to go into it with the mindset that the show Babylon 5 was the novel, this is a short story that accompanies it.  From that perspective, we couldn't have asked for more.

Galen and Lochley were two characters that really did not receive enough development given the time they had with the show, and TLT helps to remedy that situation.  I really  hope we get to see more about them and their stories in the future, becuase there is a lot of potential in both of those characters.  This is anchored by the familiar, Sheridan, which provides a nice contrast because he *is* so established.  Again, beautifully written.

The directing is also top notch, which is interesting to watch as the creator/writer fulfilled his own vision on this one.

This is something that's great for fans, but will be hard to follow if you don't know who these characters are.  I recommend picking up the rest of the series first if you have an interest in the cool, innovative storytelling that Babylon 5 has to offer.  This makes a nice appendix to the story, as it's supposed to do.

I don't know what the first reviewer was expecting, but he apparently didn't pay attention to the description of this product.  Again, this is an innovative concept, and if it sells well, we're bound to see more and with higher budgets for bigger stories.  Pick this up!",1186617600,,2278,4.594059405940594

I guess what I am trying to say is that while this is B5, don't expect it to pick up where Crusade or Legend of the rangers left off.  There are no massively huge story arcs presented and no questions are left dangling, but both stories are excellent preludes to future movies or DVD's.

I didn't know how I would like it at first, it seemed a bit odd getting back into the flow of things. The first story started off in a fashion that might first make you recall one of your least favorite episodes.

2823180,4,B000PHX8RA,"Babylon 5: The Lost Tales - Voices in the Dark is billed by WB as an original movie, but according to B5 writer and creator Straczynski, the Lost Tales is supposed to be an anthology show. Standalone stories, personally focussed, small scale. And that's exactly what we get; don't go in expecting arcs on the scale of the original show's Shadow War, or even Crusade's Drakh Plague. And don't go in expecting the ensemble cast of the original show either. Since these were the biggest strengths of original B5 the expectation might be logical, but it would lead to disappointment.

On top of this very different focus in format, it is evident that Straczynski, who also took on the director's role for this disc explicitly to figure out how to make the format work for future episodes, is  very much still experimenting and feeling out boundaries. What is achievable with the tight budgets, what can be done with the extremely green-screen focused set work, and what type of stories would be appropriate for something that is supposed to have as unique a release schedule as this.

The stories become fairly condensed because of the format. The writer has had a tendency in the past to let some of his smaller idea based plots get away from him, and to some extent this is also present in the first plot, which features some slight dialog redundancies. But perhaps because of the limitations the writing in both stories maintains a fairly tight focus, getting to the point with mostly engaging dialog and storytelling.

The first story might not sit well with everyone, since it features a type of storytelling that while appropriate to the anthology format, feels a bit out of place in B5. It's still an interesting addition to the universe, and this anthology format does really call out for some experimenting with new story forms, even if some of those experiments may fail. The second story feels very old-school Babylon 5, marrying a personal moral dilemma with an event that could change everything on a galactic scale. And as with original B5, it features a lot of prophetic foreshadowing, without in the end actually resolving how the visions seen will pan out, leaving open some explicit and interesting hooks for future stories.

Most of this disc's problems are those of a production crew that is figuring out production issues and coming to grips with a new format, much like season 1 of the original show. In great contrast with something like Legend of the Rangers, TLT like the early days of the original does show evidence of having a good foundation at its core. (Rangers could have grown into something, but the pilot had serious problems conveying any sort of depth.) This is a good thing; the issue is one of ""why didn't they go further"" rather than ""why did they bother at all"". And a slow start doesn't have to be a bad thing, as the original show showed us.

Overall, this disc has left at least this viewer very hopeful for the future. Even with the constraints they had for the first offering they managed to produce something compelling. And production, scale, and budget issues are things that can be figured out. Which is something the production team seems to be pushing for, as evidenced by this quote I'll offer as closing:

 ""Any further B5 DVDs will depend on the sales, and on Warner Brothers giving us sufficient money to take the step of making any subsequent DVDs bigger than this one,"" says Straczynski. ""This was kind of a test of the concept of making what is essentially a series on DVD, which hasn't really been done before. But it was a test, with a very modest budget. If we do more, they have to be done with a larger budget so we can involve more of our cast members, do bigger FX and locations and the like. If we can't keep making them better, then they shouldn't be done.""",1186617600,,3821,4.675595238095238
2823181,4,B000PHX8RA,"Like many other reviewers, I was looking forward to Lost Tales and hoping against hope that it would not be a disappointment along the lines of Legend of the Rangers, the various B5 movies, or most of Crusade and I'm happy to say that I wasn't. Lost Tales had great FX and two stories that could at least have been so-so episodes of the regular series. Although I admire JMS for not being afraid to present religious material in an SF setting as he does for the first tale here, and though he handles much of the dialogue well, he nevertheless lost me with the basic premise (if the devil were stuck on earth, why is there still so much evil loose in the rest of the universe?) and his insistence on bringing back the worst character from the original series (after 10 years, Lockley is still in charge of B5?!). The second story was the stronger of the two addressing as it does various elements of the B5 mythology and hinting of some epic conflagration in the future. Although I was not put off by the sparse nature of the sets or FX, what did bother me was the same thing that has bothered me about the series from the beginning namely JMS himself. Beyond his initial inspiration for the first 5 year arc, he has not had a single really good idea for the series since. Crusade was set up as an endless quest, the less said about Legend of the Rangers the better, all the B5 made for tv movies were lame. By contrast, the writers who have written many of the B5 novelizations have presented tons of good ideas within the B5 universe and I think that it's time for JMS to step aside and let others write any news stories in the series. I would suggest the creation of a new arc that would feature the revolt of Earth against the Alliance; after all, terrans have plenty to be angry and susicious about what with their apparent conquest by the Minbari (president for life Sheridan wed to the leader of Minbar ((who then steps in to take over after her husband's apparent 20 year reign)); a Minbari trained and staffed Ranger police force barging in wherever they please; a Minbari dominated Alliance dictating terms to the Earth including a demand that it relinquish all of its colonies; the capital of the Alliance being located on Minbar; an Alliance president who apparently answers to no one allowing him to do whatever he pleases without question including stealing a pair of planet destroying space ships without even so much as a by your leave; even a fly by of Minbari warships in Earth's atmosphere at the surrender ceremony. Suffice to say, when I watch the series, I see Sheridan and his Alliance as the enemy of Earth and a followup story arc detailig the story of Earth's revolt and victory against the oppressive Alliance to once more take its place as a dominant force in the galaxy would make for some great stories. Unfortunately, as long as JMS is in charge, I don't think it will happen. All that said however, if the Lost Tales continue, I will still be there.",1186617600,,2981,4.481617647058823
2823182,2,B000PHX8RA,"In many ways Babylon 5 was bungled from day one- not necessarily by the cast and crew, rather instead by the world-class batch of idiots who run Warner Brothers. What we got in the initial five year run was not what J. Michael Straczynski  had intended and foisting the 22-episode disaster that was Season 5 on us was just plain unfair. Stories abound on WB's executives how they have messed up many projects- Smallville, Teen Titans, Superman Returns- is it any wonder then that they couldn't manage to give JMS his full five years to tell the story he wanted and instead brought down to the wire each for each season and forcing him to alter the series as a result.  The Shadow War was supposed to last right through to end of Season 5, instead we get the worthless ponce Byron and the largely meaningless telepath war. Despite that, despite everything WB did to hamper the show, destroy it even, when Babylon 5 was bad it was still very good and when it was good, it was best science fiction ever seen on television, it's that simple.

It's now been almost a decade since the series ended and there must be some lingering interest in it or else Lost Tales would never have seen the light of day. As I watched it for the first time a few days ago, a part me of wished it hadn't. It was almost painful to watch the movie, presented as a pair of vignettes, because it was very obvious that Warner Brothers had given J. Michael Straczynski almost nothing to work with in terms of money. There are almost no sets- a few corridors meant to be the interior of the Babylon 5 station, a jail cell and a few spartan hallways meant to be the interior of a Minbari cruiser. One of the aspects of Babylon 5 that I always appreciated was that no matter where the camera was you could always see people- humans and aliens- in the background, breathing life into the station, giving it a sense of being inhabited. In Lost Tales there is none of this, the station appears empty and lifeless. We do not see the CnC, the Zocolo or anything from the original series. What CG we get is excellent- the revamp of the station and space craft are incredibly well done- greater detail and very beautiful. But like the stories and everything else in Lost Tales, it just isn't enough.

The first story deals with a man named Simon returning to the station after a vacation who appears to be possessed by a demon- not an alien, but an honest to goodness fire and brimstone `from the pits of Hell' demon. However, the story makes no sense once Colonel Elizabeth Lochley discovers the truth. Mankind has had space travel for two hundred years and the `demons' have been on earth the whole time and are just now making their presence known and moving into space? Sorry, that doesn't track.

The second `tale' is about Sheridan as he travels to Babylon 5 for the tenth anniversary of the Interstellar Alliance and agrees to pick up Prince Vintari of the Centauri Republic while en route. Sheridan is visited by the technomage Galen who tells him that in thirty years time Vintari will destroy earth because the humans are the only force in the galaxy capable of stopping the Centauri from reclaiming their former glory- we knew the Minbari were dying out, but who knew it would happen this quickly? Galen then explains that Sheridan must kill Vintari and sets up an elaborate scheme to make it happen when the two dignitaries are transiting from the Minbari cruiser to the station.

My theory is that JMS knew how much money he would be working with when he wrote the scripts (he also directed Lost Tales) and as a result got a this very weak offering. In my view, Babylon 5's fire has gone out of the universe and it's time is over, but it took Lost Tales to prove it. Maybe if there had been more money and a larger crew, something beautiful might have come of this. Instead we get an hour and half of mediocre story telling. If there is anything more to be done with Babylon 5 then perhaps WB needs to step forward with some dough and let J. Michael Straczynski tell the tales he wants instead of forcing him produce movies like this.

Only three characters have re-joined this project from the original series - Sheridan, Lochley and the Techno-mage. Also, are added three new characters. That's it!!! No more characters are in the movie!!! All the dialogues are between six. and only six, characters!!! The dialogues themselves are long and boring. The acting itself lacks any imagination and the actors seem tired of the series and of themselves.

Also, there are no special efects that are special, no exquisit space batles, nothing that will make this movie stand out on it's own. Even B-5 lacks details that were visible in the old series.

To summerise - This movie was ment to be a cash infusion to those that made it. The movie is boring and lacks any charisma. One of the most boring movies I have seen in a long time. Wait till it goes below, way below, 10$.",1186531200,7,1013,4.494565217391305
2823196,4,B000PHX8RA,"Having been without any new Babylon 5 filmed project since ""Legend of the Rangers"", this was a welcome return to the world that engrossed us for five years.  With several cast members no longer with us, JMS wisely decided that, rather than attempt a reunion movie which wouldn't be a full reunion, he'd do ""short stories"" within the Babylon 5 universe.  What this means is that these aren't epic stories, but tales of a more personal nature to the characters involved.  So if you're looking for battles with the Shadows, or major conflicts between warring species, that's not what you get here.

There are two stories in this initial release.  The first, ""Over Here"", focuses on now-Colonel Lochley, who is faced with a religious dilemma that threatens both the station and her own beliefs.  The second, ""Over There"", deals with President Sheridan's return to Babylon 5 after 10 years and a moral dilemma posed to him by the technomage Galen.

Because these are more personal stories, there is not a lot in the way of extras or elaborate effects.  On Babylon 5, we see the hangar bay (which, as usual, is primarily CGI, though still seeming a little undermanned for what we're used to), plus a few corridors and chambers in less-traveled areas of the station.  The Sheridan segment gives us a balcony view of Minbar, one of New York, plus some interiors on a Minbari ship and in the cockpits of Starfuries.  For the most part, these are handled effectively, though it is a little disconcerting to see a more minimalist approach after the epic nature of the original series.

The performances are where Babylon 5 always thrived, though, and all are top-notch in this production.  Boxleitner, Scoggins, and Woodward all slide fairly effortlessly back into their characters' skins and all provide the necessarily emotional weight to the scenes and dilemmas their characters are involved in.

In summary, if you're a fan of the characters and how they handled the weighty problems they faced on the show, you'll enjoy this DVD.  If you're looking for another epic along the lines of what you saw in the show, you'll probably leave a little disappointed.",1186531200,,2149,4.868131868131868
2823197,3,B000PHX8RA,"I was really happy to see more B5 stories coming out.  These were such great characters and it was always obvious there was more to tell.  I've heard of the talk of their being more DVD's making this more an anthology.  That would be fine.  I just hope the following DVDs have larger stories.  Though these were formatted to be like two TV episodes, they really just barely had enough story to carry them though.  Mind you i loved the actors and they did fine for the majority of it.  But, B5 was always an EPIC story before so it's hard to gt back into it when the story seems to be starting out more meekly.  Here's hoping for more to come.",1186531200,,642,4.204918032786885
2823198,2,B000PHX8RA,"I'm glad that JMS's career is in high gear.  We all owe him a lot for the brilliant SciFi that he created in Bab5, and he deserves the success that he is now experiencing.  However, if he didn't have the time to write a couple of decent stories for this movie, then he just should have shelved this project.  He's known as a brilliant writer, but he didn't live up to his press here.

The first story is just NOT set within the Babylon 5 universe.  My guess is that Straczynski had a neat little story set elsewhere that he decided to use here. Without spoilers beyond the first few minutes, WHY did Lockley call in a priest rather than assuming this was the work of telepaths?  No mention of telepaths at all, and everything could be explained this way.  Tracy Scoggins and Alan Scarfe do a decent job with the material (think ""My Dinner With Andre"" in space) but it is slow and plodding, and the resolution is just not in harmony with B5.

The middle of the movie picked up with some nifty exchanges between Sheridan and Galen, but the story resolution was completely predictable and unoriginal.  Again, no spoilers, but we have seen this story countless times before.  My husband started predicting and spouting the dialogue a couple of seconds BEFORE the characters spoke their lines.

I bought this rather than renting it because I own all the other B5 and have watched everything several times (except for Legend of the Rangers).  I wanted to support this project in the only meaningful way, by plopping down my dollars.  If they make more of these I won't make the same mistake again. Rent first, then buy only if it is worth the money.  This wasn't.",1186531200,4,1657,4.5353535353535355
2823199,1,B000PHX8RA,"If this is what Babylon 5 has become, it should be put out of it's misery. The effects are great, unfortunetly that's all that is great. The story line and acting are less than that of the original series and seem to be two parts of two different, two part episodes. The sets are very minimal with barely a peek back into the big baby. The second part with Sheridan has a little flair but the budget shows when they don't even suit up for the starfury trip, a cheap way out of making the costumes. With all the dialog trying to be cerebral, there is a real lack of action. Strike that, No Action. Galen is the only character who's acting is up to par and I wish that there was more featuring him. The price is pretty high, I imagine that it will drop after the ""suckers"" have bought their copies, look for it in the bargin bin in a few weeks.",1186444800,7,842,4.140243902439025

References to their characters were tastefully integrated into the storyline.  Lost Tales was a fresh blast back to some of my favorite memories, with contemporary (stunning) special effects.  Although it could not possibly have the same impact as episodes from the original series, it revived my hunger for the B5 universe and what it represented.  Please, JMS, continue this with additional episodes...",1186444800,,595,5.423913043478261
2823201,3,B000PHX8RA,"I first learned of the direct-to-DVD Babylon 5 series in a TV Guide news blip months ago, and I anxiously awaited its first release. I really enjoyed the television series and have all the DVDs for everything B5. I was glad to see there would be occasional additions to my collection, and I pre-ordered this latest release, ""The Lost Tales - Voices in the Dark,"" with great anticipation. I got it in the mail yesterday, and I watched it as soon as I could get the package opened.

It's hard to have to say it about anything B5, but ""Voices in the Dark"" leaves me disappointed. It's billed as ""An Original Movie"" but, at only 72 minutes, it's barely more than an episode. That alone would not greatly distress me, although I'd have preferred a three-hour blockbuster. Even 72 minutes of new B5 would be welcome. But those 72 minutes don't really add up to all that much.

There are two arcs in this ""movie,"" the first centered on the station and the second located primarily on a Minbari ship carrying Interstellar Alliance President John Sheridan to Babylon 5. (Not much in the way of spoilers here, for those who haven't yet seen the release.) The very first thing you notice is how unpopulated B5 has become in the ""ten years"" since Sheridan first became President. The TV series had people coming and going in the corridors, in the docking bays, in the zocalo -- hustling and bustling. Now it seems there are about 10 people left in this sector of space. No aliens, other than a couple of Minbari on Sheridan's ship; no strange plants, no steam sprays, not much of anything seems to be going on. Babylon 5 quiet and uncluttered? Now that stretches the imagination! I am sure there are plenty of people who would be willing to put on Ranger clothes or medical uniforms or Earthforce uniforms or whatever, and just wander about looking as though they're up to something. I know I would! So what's with the emptiness? I understand that almost all of the TV series' props and artifacts have been lost or stolen, and it sure looks like it in this release!

The two loosely-connected story arcs are only mildly interesting. The absence of other important characters is glaring. Sheridan and Lochley are here, as they should be, and Galen has a large part in the second arc. But they are the only ones! Everybody else is just mentioned. For the 10th anniversary of the formation of the Interstellar Alliance, Delenn would NOT have been away doing something else. Garibaldi WOULD have made it. G'Kar and Lyta are out exploring along the rim, as established at the end of the TV series, so their absence is understandable (and Andreas Katsulas is sadly passed away). Vir Cotto could have been there. Again, its the absence of people, either as station residents or important regulars, which is so obvious. Here's the point -- if these important characters could not make it for this release, then plot out a story line which would not need their presence. Sheridan and Lochley and Galen are enough for some adventure or situation which didn't need the others.

One character has been added, that of Centauri third-in-line Prince Regent Dius Vintari, son of former Emperor Cartagia. (No real spoiler there, he says so himself almost immediately). He and Sheridan, along with Galen, make up the bulk of the second arc of this release. And it is significantly better than the first arc. This new character has intriguing possibilities, and I hope to see more of this guy. If you have read the Babylon 5 books, you'll know Vintari isn't in them but you can see where his character could ""fit in."" Which just goes to show that even if the ""usual"" cast can't all be here, an interesting new character or two can be brought in and a good story can come of it. If the entire ""Voices in the Dark"" release had been a good two-hour movie about this story line, then the DVD would have been much more rewarding.

The B5 universe is a rich one, with so many bits and pieces that many, many great stories -- ""Lost Tales"" -- are there somewhere. If you are an avid B5 fan (there are many), you should get this DVD just so you don't miss anything. It isn't awful, but it isn't great either. I'm willing to overlook its flaws just because it's more B5. I hope this is only the first of several more direct-to-DVD releases. And equally, I hope each will be better than the last, because we can start to build up some details in the environment (no more lost or stolen props, OK?) Whatever gets released next, I'll buy it. It's still Babylon 5, after all.",1186444800,4,4530,4.580764488286067
2823202,5,B000PHX8RA,"I don't understand why some people are unhappy with these stories. I guess there should have been more ship battles to make these people happy. The acting was good, the stories are good, and the CGI is  spectacular, out of this world amazing. I am a huge B5 fan, I own every DVD ever made. However, I am not kool-aid drinker, I do criticize the show. I believe Thirdspace was poorly done and I can't sit through the river of souls, and I don't know what the heck happened with Legend of the Rangers. These stories are not even close to being that bad. These stories are on par with some of the better episode from back in the day. They don't hold a candle to the great episodes but they are enjoyable. I think people who have been waiting for new B5 material for some time, are expecting too much. I to would like to have seen some of the threads from the show resolved but I'll take this. I will be in line to buy the next DVD series.",1186444800,,935,4.165745856353591
2823203,5,B000PHX8RA,"Thank ""the creator""! With Joe Michael Straczynski in full control (creating, writing and directing) of this production the Kosh-awful Legend of the Rangers and the name-cannibalising-not-to-be-movie are finally a thing of the past and hopefully any 'last word' on B5 will come from JMS himself.

The two tales focus on the subject of choice and the first one even offers a new definition of heaven and hell. While this is true B5 stuff, the rather short running time and the topics are reminiscient of TWILIGHT ZONE at its best. I would not have wanted it any other way, but now I'm longing for more!!!

Babylon 5 has never looked that great before. The CGI is state-of-the-art and delivers original Starfuries, takes us to places on B5 we haven't seen before and much more. The anamorphic 16x9 transfer is clear and spotless. Hello, Warner Home Video! Can you please utilize the new CGI to clean up the mess you made when you transferred the original 4:3 CGI into 16x9 widescreen for the season 1-5 box sets?!

And a word to the Bee-Fivers out there reading this review. Your election candidate is B5 and more of it? Then make some donations to support your candidate, i.e. buy this DVD. If Warner sees good sales figures, then there is a realistic chance of more to come...",1186444800,2,1275,4.708520179372197
2823204,2,B000PHX8RA,"The Lost Tales consists of two stories. The first one revolves around a demon taking over the body of a human, and Capt. Lochley's working with a priest to determine just what they need to do about that possession.

The story is almost all talk with very limited action. It really involves only three characters and, for that reason alone, if no other, does not even begin to live up to the quality of the ""original"" Babylon 5. The show almost always involved a number of characters playing off each other, and the viewer was treated to a wide variety of views, ideas, thoughts, clashes, etc.

To limit an episode to only a few people, and then to have almost the entire episode be limited to philosophical banter, creates an episode which is, essentially, very dull. The philosophical/spiritual approach was done well in episodes like ""Soul Hunter"" and ""The Parliament of Dreams."" This movie section is but a shadow of what has gone before.

This doesn't count the fact that the very appearance of the station interior has changed too much. Originally, the station had basically a ""lived-in"" look. It was sort of dirty and run-down in a few places, and that made it more believable. The Babylon 5 in this special production is so neat and clean I almost expect to see some kind of droids walking by all the time with brooms and dust pans.

The second story involves Sheridan and Galen, the Techno-mage. There's a Centauri that, if a few decades, could become responsible for the destruction of earth. Sheridan has to decide what needs to be done about that.

The story is better done than the first story. The characters are more interesting, there is a mix of action and talk, and the story is more believable than the other story.

Still, The Lost Tales doesn't really work.  It's sort of like it's an aside to Babylon 5, and not really Babylon 5. Another thing that's sort of bothersome; it's almost an all-human movie. Granted, there is one Centauri, but all the rest of the characters that actually do anything are human (well, one possessed human). One of the best things about the original Babylon 5 was seeing the interactions between the various aliens and the aliens and the humans. This is down to a very minimal level in this movie.

The whole thing is basically an excellent example of the saying ""you can never go home again."" This is not really Babylon 5 of old.",1186444800,5,2378,4.645238095238096
2823205,1,B000PHX8RA,"Babylon 5, probably the best sci-fi vehicle ever made for television, bears little or no resemblance to this pointless sampler. These two short films will leave you wondering when the real Babylon 5 episodes will begin, and when will these terrible trailers be over? Oh, they're not trailers, this is the actual content. Well, maybe I can re-gift it to someone I don't like. The two pointless, irrelevant stories here will leave you wishing for more made-for-TV post-series movies instead of this. The only reason I can conceive of for having made it in the first place is BRUCE AND TRACY NEED MONEY.

If you really appreciated the original series, it's engaging and bold plots, it's excellent characters and acting, the way it beautifully reflected contemporary issues, and just astoundingly good story telling, this DVD will leave you in tears of remorse.

I did not regret my decision and I am glad I bought this as some parts are pure golden B5.

Ok, the CGI wasn't nearly what I expected and the acting was a bit off in some parts but other areas simply shined and stood out as a ""wow, its back"" factor. Bruce and Peter were fantastic and you could see they enjoyed being back in the role of their characters. The only sad part was the wonderful honor given to the actors who, as they say, went beyond the rim.

As to the other complaint that the ""shows"" were too short, I am not sure what they saw. Yes, they are on the limited side but given the story they told it didn't need to be longer. I would rather watch fewer minutes of quality than see JMS try and stretch like so many other shows.

""NONE"" were ever made as low budget as Lost Tales. The 2007 episode of Babylon-5: The Lost Tales, has a 15 minute story line stretched into 60 minutes using very few props - and I do mean very few. And for the most part... there's only three actors - 5-total.

But... in the special features section on the DVD there's a memorial/tribute for two of the original main actors who have past away, G'Kar in 2006, and Dr. Stevens in 2004. That feature is worth buying the DVD for.

2823220,4,B000PHX8RA,"Just ask anyone who knows me well, and they'll tell you how much I love Babylon 5.  While I think the series is great, I have had a luck warm reaction to the movies and spin offs.  So, while I was quite anxious to watch this, I was afraid I might not like it.  Fortunately, my fears were for nothing.

This DVD release is a combination of two short stories.  And with each one clocking around 35 minutes, I do mean short.  They are only slightly tied together.

Up first, we find Colonel Lochley (Tracy Scoggins) dealing with a strange new force on the station.  In fact, she's called in a priest because it appears to be a demon possession.  Is that what it really is?  Should they try an exorcism?

Of the two stories, I felt this one moved slower.  Still, it engaged me and I was quite into the story by the time it ended.  And the ending really amazed me again at JMS's storytelling abilities.

The second story centers on President Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) and techno-mage Galen (Peter Woodward).  Sheridan is on his way to Babylon 5 for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the alliance.  Along the way, Galen appears to him with a vision of the destruction of the earth.  That destruction is still preventable.  Will Sheridan do what needs to be done to save Earth?

This story felt even more like something from the Babylon 5 universe to me, and I quickly got into it.  The pace was fast and the emotion real.  I really liked it.

The special effects on both of these stories were outstanding.  The show has always used cutting edge technology, and this DVD is no exception.  In fact, what is done here puts the series to shame.

But the disc does have its flaws.  You can tell by the limited sets and set dressings what a small budget they had to work with.  Frankly, I missed most of the characters from the series, although I did like the references to them scattered throughout the film.  And the tributes to Richard Biggs and Andreas Katsulas, both during the show and in the extras, were truly moving.

In the end, this is a disc for the series fans.  It's not as good as the series, but it's really very close and highly satisfying.",1186358400,3,2172,4.411616161616162
2823221,5,B000PHX8RA,"The Lost Tales allows JMS to explore the sides of Sheridan and company that we never saw. The series was committed to certain ""story arcs"" that required closure (except, I am sad to say, Crusade). To understand the whole impact of what is going on and why, you really need to get the whole series, which was one of the premier series ever made on TV. The depth of characters is added to in both these story's, and I felt both of them were classic B5 material. The CG is outstanding, as Lightwave has advanced tremendously in the years since, and it shows. The details of the new B5 version, the scenes of the attack on Earth, all show that the CG support they got was top notch. This is a wonderful show,but some questions remain that did not get addressed, such as how did earth escape the Drakh plague loosed upon it, at the end of the original series in the prequel movie for Crusade? How does Galen (the technomage) fit in with his supposed journey on Excalibur in Crusade, to being a contact of Sheridan? It could be another story, as it is 10 years in the future from the start of Crusade, and though the series never finished, it could be answered in another tale. Also, maybe a whole new series could be devised to fit in between them. It is very nice to be back in the B5 world, although it was sad to not see G'Kar or Londo, the two deepest characters in the series, but all in all, a worthy addition to my (complete now) B5 library. Highly reccomended, but need to watch the series to fully get involved in it. Great Job B5 cast and staff! Thank you!

""Lost Tales"" still has some good writing (JMS still composes a good speech and there is a nice tribute to Katsulas/G'Kar and Biggs/Dr. Franklin) and the principal actors do a good job but the effects and scenery seem very bare bones. It's a shame that it seems like the franchise has almost taken a step back. Even the made-for-TV movies were better. With the excellent writing and loyal fanbase I can't believe someone like Scifi Channel wouldn't support B5; this could not have been more expensive (except for actors' salaries) than the dreck that's usually on Saturday night.

The CGI improvements used in this mini-drama are excellently done and impressively executed. The only thing missing is more stories (DVD's)...MORE OF THE SAME! To any die-hard B5 fan, this just wets the appetite for more.

Bruce Boxleitner and Tracy Scoggins each game impressive performances, as well as Peter Woodward. Keegan MacIntosh also is a fresh face (and talented young actor)--new character with ties that sends chills up the spine of any B5 fan.

The stories, typical of J Michael Straczynski, are better the more they are viewed. What to the initial viewing may seem one thing, upon closer viewing (and listening) reveals many layers of thought and imagination. It is very obvious JMS has made a lifetime study of humanity and the psychology thereof...his writing has many levels of introspection--philosophical, spiritual (where appropriate), psychological, and very human--get to your gut feelings--but you have to be willing to go beyond the first viewing to get there! Unfortunately, there is (also) the feeling that something is ""missing."" JMS usually gave three plots per episode for the series. The absence of a third story intertwined with the other two is a big void at times...you keep hoping for more. The intended plot story with Jerry Doyle would have been best to have left in the mix, instead of saving it for another DVD...

One can only hope that this will be the first of many ""stories"" in the B5 universe that fans have been craving since the series left the airwaves. Warner Bros has its fingers on a real treasure, if they would only allow it to be in syndication again...

All in all, this is a must-have for B5 fans who have waited so long for more stories to tease our psyche.

I have to admit that I chuckled at some of the lines, especially in the last story with Sheridan...""Is that a new dress?"" And the tribute to Andre Katsulas and Richard Biggs was touching (""They are out there together beyond the rim""). The short running time was the only one reason I rated this 4 of 5 stars.

This is just a continuation of the decline of Season 5, although I thought it couldn't get any worse.

Is this really the first of 6 DVD movies?  Well, you lost me already, JMS.  Go look back at Season 3 and 4 and try to remember what really had us hanging on until the next week.

I've never been a fan of Tracy Scoggins, but I think the real problem had to do with the writing and the lack of the character Zack Allen which this epsideo could've used.  The second episode is worthy of being B5.  Boxleitner does some great acting and has a great quotable line about ""hope"".

2823230,2,B000PHX8RA,"I was a rabid fan of the show in the 90s and have all the dvd's.  I am sorry folks, but this did not measure up to the show I enjoyed 10 years ago.  I miss the stations full of people and aliens, the zocalo, busy corridors on the station, and the moldy & sleezy down below.  An original episode of B5 would have several different characters and plots going on at the same time.  There was not enough going on in the background that painted the tapestry of the old B5.  The B5 station didn't even have the same feel to it.

As far as extras go, the memorial was the best part of the dvd.

The sock puppets was really stupid and should have been left out.  If it was a joke from the conventions, it just doesn't translate onto the dvd.  And we are tired of JMS's arrogant attitude.

2823231,5,B000PHX8RA,"It seems like most of the gripes aired here about TLT focus on one of four aspects:

1. Budget and FX
2. Writing
3. Lack of ""Kewl"" Space Battles
4. The Acting

Let's look at each of these:

1.and 3. Okay, the FX wasn't perfect out of the gate, but still, given the budget they had to work with, it was very good. Granted it was a little weak in the docking bay sequences, but how many of us remember the then-cutting edge of CGI technology back when B5 was on, and how much pressure Foundation (and later Netter Digital) were under to produce fluid and mostly believable FX work under a weekly deadline? And look at the strides in virtual set technology, which made it possible to even film TLT on the budget that it had. Without the FX capabilities we have now, it's possible that TLT might not have been filmed at all.

And look at what they got RIGHT. What we see is a)consistent with the B5 we once watched, and b)in much finer detail than what we once had available to us. All they need now is the budget to continue developing high-res models for the remainder of the ships in the B5 universe and work on their interior set CGI design a little bit.

2. I'm guessing that those who were disappointed in TLT were expecting the grand, grandiose space battles of S4, rather than the dialogue and character-driven set pieces that we've been given here.

As a writer, JMS has said before that he tends to prefer writing small, almost theater-esque scenes where the dialogue and characterization drive the drama, rather than flashy FX, and TLT as a production comes straight from that belief.

Quite a few B5 episodes, such as Eyes (S1), And the Sky Full of Stars (S1), Comes the Inquisitor (S2), Passing through Gethsemane (S3), Intersections in Real Time (S4), Rising Star (S4), and The Long Night of Londo Mollari (S5), don't focus on the big epic or depend on big-budget FX to carry the episode, but instead feature drama based on one or two characters' choices and convictions in the face of a real threat (namely, their professional or personal death), not to mention the consequences from those choices, which occur because of (or in spite of) those choices.

The overall theme of TLT takes that theme a step further: there's always a third choice, and that the choice taken in both cases was not the one anticipated or offered ... there was always the third way of looking at the situation. In that sense, the writing is a worthy addition to the B5 universe, and thematically, ranks it up there with JMS' better writing efforts.

The quality of the dialogue and the humor and the pacing? Granted, JMS has been knocked on all three in past efforts, but if anything, the dialogue, the humor, and the pacing in TLT were crisper and better written than a bit of his previous work and especially better than the last foray into B5 territory, with Legend of the Rangers. Heck, it was certainly better than 80 percent of what currently passes for shows on the Sci-Fi Channel (and before you flame me, I say this as a BSG fan, a nuWho fan, and a Stargate SG-1 fan as well, and I count those shows in the remaining 20 percent).

4. The acting. Honestly, acting is a component of the material you're given, and in that respect, Tracy Scoggins' performance does seem a little bit ""muted"" in the first 15 minutes of her half, but I suspect that's because of the position she's been put in: in order to save time showing ""what went before"", a lot of her dialogue is voice-over or exposition, which really doesn't give her much to work with as an actress: she has to set up the backstory and explain the situation to Father Cassidy (and the viewers). After that speed bump, though, she nicely underplays Lochley through the rest of it.

In part two, both Boxleitner and Woodward show their chops as actors; Boxleitner managing to do a quite passable Bill Clinton-esque turn as ISA President, and Woodward bringing a darker edge to Galen not seen in the spin-off, Crusade.

One thing that seems to have been overlooked is the performance of Keegan MacIntosh as Regent Vintari, who managed to pull off something amazing: Vintari is supposed to be the son of the mad former Emperor Cartagia (played by actor Wortham Krimmer), and MacIntosh manages to evoke Krimmer's performance (and portray the son of the father) without copying it.

All in all, it was an excellent return to form, and a worthy foray into the B5 universe. I hope that the sales allow JMS to continue making these and bring back more familiar characters.",1186272000,7,4512,4.5762081784386615
2823232,4,B000PHX8RA,"People who are expecting a full-blown movie will be disappointed with this DVD.  But then, if you took any single episode of the first season of B5 and expected *it* to be a movie, you'd be disappointed with that too.  This is not a movie, it is an episode of a series.  Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing what the rest of the series will be like, or how long it might run.

In my mind, this is something of an experiment.  Warner is trying to see if it could have a TV series without the bother of having it on TV.  They did a good job with special effects, but since this is just a single DVD, they didn't go out and hire a full cast of characters.  As one example, it would have been much better to *see* Delenn say ""I won't be able to attend"", even if that was just a 10-second shot, then to have Sheridan explain that to Lochley.  But it would be odd hire the actor for some major character when you're only going to give them a 10-second shot in a single episode.

I liked the two stories.  It was nice to see the B5 universe come alive again.  I could see this being part of a series where I would rate that as 5-stars, but it's kinda hard to convince myself that this DVD by itself really justifies a 5.  I do think it's a good solid 4, though.

I pre-ordered this DVD, and this is good enough that I am sure I'd pre-order the next DVD.  I do hope they could film a few of these at a time, though, so we would see a wider range of the main characters.  They *could* have had a 10-second shot of Delenn in this episode, for instance, if she was also there to film a major part for some other DVD in the series.

 (--- the following was added later ---)

Okay, I can see where this review probably doesn't tell you much, but I didn't want to give away too much of the plot.  Let me say that I thought the first story was more intriguing to me, because I think it's the first time where we see a story on religion where the *religion* might have some basis in fact.  Other stories are on ""religious people"", or the ""search to be a better person through religion"", but basically we were all supposed to be worshiping the Vorlons anyway, so we never see a story where any earth religion has the slightest bit of truth to the religion itself.

Unfortunately that first story spends too much time on backstory, which was basically saying ""For those of you who are B5 fans, let me bring you up to date here..."".  That was nice to have, but IMO that could have been done as a simple extra feature, via an interview with JMS.  I mean ""simple"" in the sense that it didn't need any special effects or any actors dressed up and in proper lighting.  Then the episode itself could have spent more time developing the story.  Imagine if someone bought this disc, and had never seen the original series.  Most of this first story would have been utter gibberish to them.  Might as well have Lockley reading a genealogy of Isaiah, because it's just a bunch of names going by, and the viewer wouldn't know any of them.

The second story was better in some respects, and I thought that Bruce and Peter did very good jobs at stepping back into their characters.  But from my view as a long-time fan of the original series, this second story suffers because I already had a good idea what Sheridan would and would not do.  I don't want to say more than that though.  Note that this probably would be a better story for someone who did not know much about the original series, because they would have been more caught up in the moral issue which Sheridan was faced with.

Still, the DVD was good enough that I was happy with it.  The interviews with cast members was enjoyable, at least for anyone who was really into the original series.  Those really brought home the feeling of the cast members over the loss of Richard Biggs and Andreas Katsulas.  The last time all these people had worked together, they had been working with those two actors who are now forever gone.

So my initial review wasn't too helpful, but after I read all the other reviews I mainly wanted to say that we can't review this as if it is some stand-alone movie.  If you're expecting ""B5.2: The Wrath of Londo"", well, this isn't it.  But then, it didn't claim to be a movie.  It's a DVD with two ""lost tales"", where we already know that they hope to do a whole series of other ""lost tales"".

One complaint that I can agree with is that this is a bit expensive, especially when you consider that it is basically a single episode of the TV series.  If you buy season one of the original series, you will be getting 22 episodes for $40-$50.  Here you're getting what amounts to a single episode for (say) $15.  That is not a great value.  I wish they would release these as a digital download for $2 or $3, and then put out a DVD once they had four or five episodes they could package together as a single DVD.

2823233,3,B000PHX8RA,"While I really enjoy the concept, and may even consider buying the next release, I think they should have dropped the price some.  It's basically two (short) episodes of B5 for $20 (yes, I realize it's dropped in price here, but I bought it retail).  If it was $15, that would be more palatable.

Having said that, the episodes were well done, and the special effects have improved drastically with new technology since the series was made.  I came by the score by docking it one star for quality of the shows and 1 star for the price.

Regarding the quality, I'm not referring to the acting or the special effects.  I'm referring to the fact that the two storylines were completely seperate from each other.  They should have had some corellation between the two, but it's more like they took two great ideas for episodes and just slapped them together into one movie.

Regarding the price...I believe I already covered that sufficiently.  I'm a huge fan of B5 (LOTR and Crusade notwithstanding), but I'll have to consider carefully whether I intend to buy the next release.  If I do, it will definitely not be for $20.  I'll wait for it to drop in price.",1186272000,2,1156,4.590243902439024

2823248,1,B000PHX8RA,"The disc has two episodes, ""Over Here"" and ""Over There"".  Both are set ten years after the birth of the Interstellar Alliance.

Over Here:
The only thing worse than the acting is the dialogue, the special effects, and the theology. And the acting isn't great.

This isn't a Babylon 5 story at all; you could have set it equally well in any ""future time in space"". There are only three characters: Colonel Elizabeth ""2-D"" Lochley, Random Nearly-Apostate Priest Dude, and Asmodeus. Unfortunately, through centuries of overeating and lack of exercise, Asmodeus's powers have reduced to those of an old window A/C unit: making the room cold, making the air smell bad, and occasionally catching on fire, so it's not as interesting as you might think.

Over There:
It's better. Not great, or even really good, but I wouldn't brand it DNPIM like ""Over Here"".

The first part of the episode was pure filler, though. Lookee, President Sheridan still hates ISN reporters. This matters how? And, he's old, yes, but that doesn't mean he has to ramble uninterestingly like a semi-senile great-grandpa. Also, you don't have to explain your jokes.

2823250,4,B000PHX8RA,"The memories swim back into focus the years of the crews trials and achievments are renewed and concreted with this movie. The Lost Tales are small stories but extremely well written , they are personal journies for Lockley and Sheridan.
  The first part not to give it away entirely brings a new spiritual side to B5 where Lockley caught in the middle of making a hard decision has to come up with new options. The dialogue here is especial well crafted and portrayed.
  The Second story brings Sheridan home to B5 but he is plagues with an aweful preminition brought to him by a techno mage and he then has to decide whether the easy choice which is wholey immoral should be taken or the harder path be realised.
  The special effects far supass the original series and seeing some of the old crew brought me a good deal of happiness but the loss of two of the key actors/characters is a sad loss and is very evident here. There are extras on the DVD where the people involved with  the Lost Tales pay homage to them Andreas Katsulas and Richard Biggs, which was very endearing and tugs on the heart strings.
  The only down sides of this is that it was clear this was a lower budget than what the show was used to but the acting and story more than make up for it. The other was that the Lost Tales felt more like an epitaph than a continuation.

2823251,4,B000PHX8RA,"I'm not entirely sure how much I like it yet.  I'll have to watch it one or two more times I think.  At 72 minutes long, it's a little bit shorter than two regular episodes and is split up into two sub-plots.  It's not entirely what I was expecting, but thinking back to what I initially heard about what Lost Tales as supposed to be, it fits pretty well.

If I recall correctly from the initial news of the Lost Tales project, it was supposed to be a series of character focused short stories.  As such, I think it does a good job of further developing and refining the traits of the two main characters that make an appearance: Lochley and Sheridan.  People expecting something resembling a full on B5 movie are likely to be disappointed.  I liked the two stories that were told, and the endings definitely fit the characters involved.  In fact, I thought the Sheridan story was predictable and had a reasonably good idea what his solution was going to be about halfway in.

The effects are pretty much all CGI with very few actual sets based on what I've seen in the special features on the DVD.  The title 'The Lost Tales' gives the impression that there will be more than just the two stories, but I think the original intent was that if this one was successful, other DVDs would likely follow.  It would be interesting to see the concept applied to other characters.

Lots of the usual extra stuff on the DVD (interviews, behind the scenes stuff), including a couple of nice tributes to Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar) and Richard Biggs (Dr. Franklin), both of whom are 'out exploring beyond the rim'.

4.5 stars out of 5 for the CGI and FX.
Overall, I think I'd give it 3.5 stars out of 5.",1186185600,2,1689,4.444805194805195
2823252,3,B000PHX8RA,"Anyone expecting The Lost Tales to fully recapture the magic that Babylon 5 had in its heyday will be rather rudely disappointed. Better to think of these two stories, totaling a bit more than an hour, as side stories, or codas, a chance to revisit characters, see how they're doing, watch them in action one more time. In that context and on their own terms, the two tales here--one focused on Colonel Lochley, the other on President Sheridan--work fairly well, all told.

""Over Here,"" the first story, features Colonel Lochley as she and a priest face what appears to be a supernatural presence. The theme of religion and faith isn't new to B5, and the story's concept fits acceptably within the science fantasy world of the series. The weakness comes mostly in the execution. In a clearly budget-saving mode, the story relies heavily on rather leaden dialogue delievered with modest conviction by the three principal characters.

""Over There,"" the second story, features Interstellar Alliance President Sheridan and works a fair sight better for many reasons, not the least of which being that the Sheridan character, having been around for four of the series's five seasons, carries more emotional resonance than does Lochley, a rather flimsy substitue for Susan Ivonova in Season Five. The presence of the technomage Galen, who appeared in the B5 movie ""A Call to Arms"" but was also part of the spinoff series ""Crusade,"" is also a welcome returnee. In ""Over There,"" Sheridan faces the dilemma of how to deal with the seemingly certain knowledge that a Centauri royal third in line of succession will someday destroy Earth. The peril seems a bit more real here, if only just (given the well-established parameters of the Sheridan character by this point), but JMS's touch is a bit lighter here script-wise, a bit more money was spent on effects, and there's a hint of the sense of fun and magic that made the original series so memorable for so many, me included.

Christopher Franke returns to score the movie, and the sound track is comfortingly familiar, with a few new touches. The effects are a mixed bag. The station itself looks good, and the space backgrounds as well as the ""quantum space"" jumping are quite good. The worst aspect is clearly the CGI shot of the docking bay, painfully used in both stories. While the image itself is fine, the actors appear to be standing against a screen (which, of course, they were)--the image has virtually no depth, and I was afraid that when Sheridan considers walking around on his own that he was going to hurt himself running into a wall.

JMS's scriptwriting and directing are about as uneven as the stories. ""Over Here"" relies on silly camera tilting to an aggregious extent, and there's not so much dialogue as speeches delievered at ponderous length back and forth between the characters. ""Over There"" is lighter in tone and a fair bit tigther, even if the moral lesson is hammered on with something less than subtlety.

The extras include interviews with the principals, some behind-the-scenes stuff, and memorials to two of the series's cast members who died after the conclusion of the original run: Richard Biggs (Dr. Franklin) and Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar). There are some touching allusions to their passing in ""Over There"" as well.

Overall, ""Over Here"" rates 2 out of 5 stars, ""Over There"" inches up to 4 out of 5, bringing the pair to a soft 3. At this point, after the death of Biggs and, especially, Katsulas, and after the canceling of the proposed feature-film sequel, this direct-to-DVD experience is about the only B5 we're likely to see in visual form. But JMS really never promised us anything else; part of the charm of B5 the series was that it was a closed book, with a beginning, middle, and end. These stories are just echoes of what's already past. They're like the B-story of a TV episode shorn of their A-story. And yet, they're not bad for all that, and there's some comfort in catching up with old friends, even if it's just to say hi and to ask after them before we head out into the dark again.",1186185600,7,4081,4.7897727272727275

Nor is it a next chapter in a new component to the franchise.  What it is however, is brilliant story telling in true B5 fashion.  Not to give it away, but in my opinion we have a story that deals with the classic struggle of good versus evil (one of the pillars of the B5 universe IMHO) and we have a story that puts a character at a cross roads with dire consequences for making the wrong choice.  Both are thought provoking stories which is what B5 was all about, not that watered down Star Trek stuff Paramount was shoveling with Voyager and Enterprise (S1-S3, not counting Manny Cotto's S4).  If you want two wonderful (IMHO) pieces of B5 story telling then you won't be disappointed.

My original review is as follows:

I am a Babylon 5 fan. Actually, the reason I bought my first DVD player was to be able to watch the original series. I have seen every installment more times than I would like to admit. With the possible exception of The Legend of the Rangers, I have always been quite happy with all things B5. Heck, I even thought that Crusade was starting to pick-up when it was cancelled.

Here goes... The Lost Tales is absolutely terrible. Owch, that really hurts to type. I simply could not bring myself to rate any B5 production with only one star, but that really is the rating it deserves.

Less talk and more explosions. It really is just that simple. B5 has always been an intelligent show. The original series had a great balance between drama and action. Lack of this balance is what separates this film from the good old stuff. Obviously, The Lost Tales suffered from a pitiful budget, but the writing should not have been poor as a result of that fact. JMS has written many, many good things in his career; this is just not one of them.

With all of that being stated, the few CG shots offered were really nice. The exterior shots of the station were lovely.

To conclude, I have certainly not given up hope on the quality of any upcoming B5 projects, but this was truly painful to watch.",1186185600,4,1535,4.368421052631579
2823255,5,B000PHX8RA,"Series creator J. Michael Stracynski has given us two linked stories that are more intimate in scale than the original series. If there is a problem with this DVD, it's that the second, Sheridan-centered story is so good that the talky first segment, which focuses on station commander Lochley, is overwhelmed. I found myself wishing that he had used the Lochley story as a ""B"" plot, which would have had the effect of highlighting the stronger Sheridan story, cutting up some excessively long blocks of dialog, and making more effective use of the acting staff and sets.

The original sets and CGI elements have for the most part been lost, so we don't see some B5 landmarks -- C&C, Lochley's office, what have you. And there aren't enough extras, costumes and prosthetics for the crowd scenes that were a hallmark of the series. Also missing, of course, the cumulative tensions of a five-year story arc, though Straczynski introduces some compelling new ones.

On the other hand, the effects are spectacular, the sets, props, and costumes that we do see are hardly chintzy, and there's some very fine acting.

In the end, I'd say that TLT suffers only by comparison to the very best of the original series, which is to say that it's head and shoulders above most of what one sees on TV. Were I to rate it against Stracynski's best, I'd probably give it a four, but I think it makes more sense to rate it against what's out there, so I've given it a five.",1186185600,2,1456,4.635658914728682

2823258,4,B000PHX8RA,"Yes, it's not action packed and doesnt have some huge overall story.  It's basically two little morality/slice of life tales set in the B5 universe.  Nothing is really added to the characters or universe, but the stories themselves are pretty interesting and entertaining.  If you treat them as two episodes and compare them to B5 the series, they would be average, not classic, but not stinkers.

The first 'episode', which features Lochley trying to figure out what to do with a B5 resident who claims to be possessed, would probably get 3 stars - it is a bit too preachy and full of itself dealing, as it does, with religious themes.

The second 'episode' is better, featuring the return of Boxleitner as Sheridan.  Returning to B5 for a celebration, Sheridan receives a visit from Galen who warns him of a terrible future catastrophe.  Sheridan faces a tough moral choice: is it right to take a life to prevent that future?  Dealing with Sheridan - a character with much more history and nuance than Lochley, it feels more substantial as does the story and I would give this four stars on it's own.

Both stories suffer from the lack of a secondary cast to bring more background to the story, each one probably only has two or three speaking parts so instead of cutting away to other subplots or activities what we get is more of one straight plot.

Overall, if you are a B5 fan I would recommend this - it is talky and a little dry, but it's much more in keeping and in the same tone as B5 proper, rather than the more campy Legend of the Rangers...",1186185600,80,1554,4.517857142857143

was twice as good as ""The Lost Tales""
  If you have seen that episode before, you know what to expect.
  Of course I'll buy the next video when it comes out. Heres hoping for
a better effort then.
  By the way a friend bought Lost Tales off the shelf at full price, at
least I paid 10 bucks less by buying here.",1186185600,2,857,3.976470588235294
2823261,4,B000PHX8RA,"After too long an absence, Babylon-5 returns to DVD with ""The Lost Tales.""  As an avid fan who has nearly melted the 5-season DVD set in his player over the last several years, these stories were long awaited and did not disappoint.  While short, the stories were thoughtful and well performed.  The new CGI, while providing much better views of the station and its attendant ships, did not make me think I was watching something very different from what came before.  This was Babylon-5, and the sweep of the orchestral score gave me goosebumps as I watched.  The ""feel"" of this DVD was faithful to all of those things that made me love the show in the past while giving it an updated look.

If you're a fan of the series, this DVD is a must-buy.  The writing displayed the same strength that I've come to love and expect from the series.  If there was anything disappointing about this release, it is that it leaves you hungry for so much more.  Hence, the 4 stars.

Here we are 10 years or so after the series went off the air and, given its ever-growing popularity, it is surprising that all we can get are low-budget productions.  Still, as one of our heroes said in Lost Tales, ""I've never known hope that wasn't on a diet.""  This DVD represents hope in its purest form.",1186185600,,1276,4.452586206896552

I really blew my cool when the auto play started about making some _Superman_ movie.  If wanted anything about Superman, I would have bought a Superman DVD.

I tend to agree with a lot of what previous reviewers had to say, although I do not know how they could have so long before the release.

What is not mentioned, is that the movie just -- stop.  It stop about where I expect a scene break.  If there was an conclusion, even as of an episode, I missed it.

I would like an e-mail address to pass on feedback.  Since I do not use msft, the 'net has become quite prejudicial in the last few years.

2823264,4,B000PHX8RA,"There were problems with this set of episodes, true, but I can understand why this was. The sets had long since been struck and had to be recreated, often by pure CGI. Members of the cast were off doing other things, and for one reason or another (other commitments, or in the case of Claudia Christian probably bad feelings) unavailable. And so on.

But given those limitations, it was a good set of episodes. Very B5 as I remember B5. The characters are still the same characters. (Scoggins remains infuriatingly ageless...) The overall feel of the station and the other sets retains the feel, if not the overall look, of the B5 universe. The two stories are very much like single episodes. (The first is a stand alone episode from any later season, while the second fits perfectly into the suggested later story.)

If you're expecting a mind-bending movie, you are sure to be disappointed. If you're expecting to see B5 exactly as it was, you'll feel unhappy. But if you just want to see B5 again, still good, still in line with its own internal story, you'll be glad to have this one.",1186185600,2,1088,4.603092783505154
2823265,3,B000PHX8RA,"Lost Tales essentially consists of two short stories, the first focusing on Captain Lochley while she deals with a priest and a station worker who may, just may, be possessed by a demon. Lot's of posturing on the nature of God, life, The Universe, Good and Evil etc. with some quite heavy religous and philosophical themes postulated as the story unfolds. The problem I had with this sequence is that in past episodes, the characters have already encountered creatures who are akin to gods - Lorien, the Vorlons, the Shadows and the other First Ones not to mention the creatures from Thirdspace. A literal biblical ""demon"" - if that's what one assumes the source of possesion to be (and seems to be confirmed by the final resolution though to say more would give the story away) is, well, a bit tame compared to what went before - not to mention the very real evil of the Drakh plague which infected Earth at the end of ""A Call To Arms"" and during Crusade.

The second part of the story deals with President Sheridan on his way to a conference at Babylon 5 after 10 years on Minbari. After some brief verbal sparring with a journalist and a demonstration of a faster hyperspace travel, the technomage Galen pops up with a warning that failure to act against a Centauri Emperor in waiting (actually Cartagia's son) may result in a catastrophic attack on Earth at some future date. This creates a moral dilemna for Sheridan who must decide as he accompanies the young man to B5 whether or not to kill him or look for some other course of action. Again, lots of verbal interplay and some good SFX of a Star Fury flight, but nothing that will have you on the edge of your seat.

Both stories are self contained and other than Lochley and Sheridan meeting at the end of the episode there's no attempt to link the tales for some wider resolution.

Although the graphics and effects have improved in the 10 years since the final episode aired it is fairly apparent the film has been made on a very tight budget. There's little in the way of supporting cast and most of the action is the dialogue between the characters themselves. If you're expecting grand space battles or epic voyages of galactic discovery or revelation then you may be disappointed. Also, don't expect much in the way of resolution of outstanding issues from the previous series - there is no mention of how the Drakh plague, for example, was defeated though by assumption - as travel to and from Earth is once again allowed - it must have been. The direction and production comes across more akin to a stage play - with limited actors and sets - than a TV movie.

A nice touch was the poignant reference to G'Kar and Dr. Franklin having ""travelled beyond the (Galactic) rim"", the actors Richard Biggs and Andreas Katsulas both having passed away in real life. The music of Christopher Franke also makes a welcome return - the brief reign of Evan Chen as series composer having thankfully...passed beyond the rim.

In conclusion, it's nice to see the B5 characters brought back to life again, though maybe future instalments of Lost Tales need to up the ante with a bit more action and to close some of the loose ends from the main story arcs.",1186099200,3,3206,4.578397212543554
2823276,5,B000PHX8RA,"Right off, I'll agree with some other reviewers-if you are new to B5, this is not the place to start.  For those of us who are already fans tho, this is a wonderful new start!  I actually had tears in my eyes when the new opening played. The only complaints I have are small-There should have been more people in this, even if just in the background.  As one review said, the station seems empty.  The other thing that is obviously missing, and might have helped the first problem not seem as bad, is the complete lack of background noise.  One of the things the series always had was sound-you heard the station running in the background.  That is painfully not here.  As for the rest, I thought the stories were fantastic, the FX was awesome, and most of all, to paraphrase Lochley; I felt like I was home.",1186099200,2,808,4.382550335570469

No, it isn't the best or greatest of the stories that have kept us all so enthralled with the universe JMS so lovingly created, but give our ship a chance to warm up and she could take us all back to the stars.  Seeing the opening shot of the B5 station made my hair stand on end and brought tears to my eyes. A power like that is scarce in a world void of intelligent SCI FI television.

This DVD is a gift.

2823278,4,B000PHX8RA,"As much as I dearly love the Babylon 5 universe, I have to say that this DVD is only for real B5 fans -- if you already know and love B5, you'll enjoy this DVD immensely, as much as for the additional features as for the stories themselves (The testimonials for the actors who played G'Kar and Dr. Franklin, who have both gone ""beyond the rim"", were especially moving).

The two stories (vignettes, almost) are interesting,by themselves.  In each one, the main character is presented with a choice between two evils.  To say anything more than that would be a spoiler, but the resolution of each dilemma is reasonably satisfying.  However, if the viewer lacks the previous connection to those characters, as a non-fan might, it probably isn't worth the effort.  Also, it must be noted that the two stories are smaller and more intimate, lacking the scope and arc that most B5 fans have been accustomed to getting from JMS.

But to a true fan, the simple stories of making choices are greatly augmented by already knowing who the characters are, and the contexts in which those choices are made.  Seeing John Sheridan and Elizabeth Lockley (she made Colonel, btw) again is a reunion with old friends, and no B5 fan should miss this DVD.

2823279,2,B000PHX8RA,"First of all, I watched B5 religiously on TV in the '90's. Then I purchased every season, every spinoff, and every movie on DVD. So it was with great anticipation that I ordered The Lost Tales in advance and read no reviews until after I watched it. Perhaps if I had, I'd have been  better prepared for this major disappointment. As a few reviewers have remarked, this ""movie"" is more like a padded TV episode -- and only an average one, at that. There's virtually no first-person action, very little intrigue, and very few main characters (3 per tale). The two plots plod along eventually getting to a point where you think something interesting just might happen -- only to watch with dropped jaw as the credits roll. I actually found myself struggling to stay awake (hours before my bedtime).

JMS, I sure hope the remainder of this character-oriented rebirth series surpasses the first entry. IMHO, the features including the tributes to those Beyond the Rim were more entertaining than the ""movie"". We know how truly creative you are (I even read your Marvel comics). Please don't disappoint your loyal fans. However, I don't think I'll be advance ordering the next one; I'll wait for the reviews.",1186099200,5,1202,4.8019323671497585

it was about the characters that we loved.
We look down upon the B5 universe in a straight line..
we know its beginning and its end.

2823287,4,B000PHX8RA,"I've been a B5 fan since before the beginning. I'd met Joe Straczynski back when he was story editing ""Captain Power"" and ""Ghostbusters"" episodes, and was mightily impressed back then.

Part of what attracted folks to the original B5 was its epic scale. It was literally galaxy-spanning, with empires rising and falling, ancient races arising from their hiding places, and entire planets being obliterated along their way.

If you expect that level of epic in ""The Lost Tales"", you are in for a disappointment. Instead, what JMS is doing is telling smaller, more character-focused tales set in the same background.  He is, as he says in one of the commentaries, ""filling in the corners"" in the B5 universe.

The influence of Rod Serling (Joe's writing role model) is evident in these stories. They are much more ""Twilight Zone"" in their feel - surreal situations that force characters to make moral decisions.  They are marvelous stories in their own way, but on a much smaller, more intimate scale.

I realize what a financial risk WB is taking, in creating sci-fi stories on even this scale for a direct-to-DVD release.  So, I don't begrudge them a meager budget. I'm just glad they have a storyteller as versatile and talented as JMS to give us satisfying stories with our old friends. It was good to see Sheridan, Lochley, and Galen again, and I hope to see Delenn, Garibaldi, Londo, and others soon.

2823289,4,B000PHX8RA,"I've waited a long time for another Babylon 5 production. And while The Lost Tales whets the appetite, I can't say it really sates it. While I enjoyed the episodes, my reaction was, ""Is that all?""

I was expecting the Lost Tales to be something like the great TNT movies - a big tale told in the Babylon 5 universe. What I got was ""The Twilight Zone"". You can almost imagine the camera panning to Rod Serling (or Ed Wasser), who intones, ""Imagine if you will..."" It's a good approach and one I enjoyed once I'd gotten over the shock.

So imagine if you will a Babylon 5 station worker who appears to be possessed. Colonel Lochley, desperate for help, calls a catholic minister for aide. Many have called this first part ""boring"". If so, then they must have found much of B5 boring, because it often dealt with quiet conflict and small stories (think ""Passing through Gethsemane""). Now imagine if you will being told a young man will grow up to kill millions. Could you kill that young man? This is the dilemma in the second episode. It's gotten better reviews partially because there's more action and noise. And partly because of the thrill of seeing Bruce Boxleitner in a Star Fury once more.

I enjoyed both stories and found them to be well made. The F/X have kept up - B5 has never looked better. Good acting all around and solid directing. It would have placed both stories about the middle of the pack had they occurred during the series run. The fit in perfectly with B5 universe. The dialogue has that strong JMS touch, the conflicts are profound and the solutions might be a bit too easy and trite, I didn't feel cheated.

But again, the episode are too short. 72 minutes and two small stories are not what I expected. I hope that we will see more of these in the future. But be aware that these are not the big grand TNT movies, no matter what the trailer promises. These are small character and moral studies that are lifted straight out of the Twilight Zone.",1186012800,,1971,4.466666666666667

You feel like you have stepped out of the computer of the CGI of old and are really outside the five mile long station orbiting Epsolon Eindi, like you are really there. The storytelling was truly top notch. My wife and I watch a lot of Science Fiction television & movies and I was indeed anxious about yet another B5 adventure and really quite aprehensious about another B5 tale when other offerings had some real problems here and there, not being all B5 ought to be.

2823291,5,B000PHX8RA,"Babylon 5: The Lost Tales is a blessing in disguise.  This was a great opportunity for Creator J. Michael Strazynski to give the fans what they've been dying for.  Something New.  The movie starts off where the series ends (literally) then backtracks to tell what exactly the title says; a ""Lost Tale""

  We find new ship designs, new methods of travel, and the most talked about:  Updated Special Effects, which compliment the tone of the movie well and are handy considering set designs are not cost effective.  Budget aside, The first part of these ""Lost Tales"" provoked my thoughts to another new perspective, and kept me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see the wonderful, albeit short, ending.  Acting is great and it was wonderful to see some familiar faces compliment the series with their presence (Alan Scarfe and Teryl Rothery).

  The Second part is definitely the Fan service.  from a plot line thought dead in season 4 giving a new seed (practically literally) to glimpses of these updated effects in a battle scene.  With another story that was simple, yet effective.  Not as provoking as the first, but the message was clear and effective.  The chemistry between characters was felt well, and the pauses tried to make the film seem longer.

  In Summary, aside from ""Budget"" arguments and ""complaints"" of time and acting, I felt Babylon 5: The Lost tales was a simple, yet effective DVD that shows us while we ""Cannot create life;""  we can ""breath upon the remaining embers"" and give this DVD our full support in hopes of Longer, and more powerful DVD movie from the Babylon 5 universe.",1186012800,2,1611,4.768115942028985
2823292,4,B000PHX8RA,"First off, I'm not a diehard fan of Babylon 5 or JMS.  I've seen the series twice and i know the show has it's flaws.  So I am neither going to give this 5 stars because it's B5 nor am I going to give it 1 star because I'm not a B5 fan.

After reading some reviews, I thought the dvd would be absolutely horrible.  As it turned out, they're very watchable.  It's obvious that there is a very small budget to produce the show.  But while watching it, it provided me with fond memories of the original series and I wished that there would be a 3rd episode on this DVD.

Yes, there are basically no sets at all in the entire dvd.  One scene was entirely in a black room.  However, the directing was actually pretty good in that the scenes were not cheesey.  Perhaps, because this dvd was fairly succesful in sales that the budget for future productions will be bigger.  This is hopefully just a start.

I was very pleasantly surprised by the CGI in the dvd.  Babylon 5 looked pretty gorgeous to me.  The star furies put a huge smile on my face because they actually looked like fighters this time around and not big square tanks like in the original show.  For that alone watching the dvd is worth it.  Overall most of the CGI was very well done.  And the 60 or so second battle was absolutely impressive and gorgeous.  If further stories involved battle scenes like that then they are absolutely worth purchasing.

Galen's acting was awesome.  I seriously do not remember him being so charming but he was.  Boxleitner was good as usual and really captured Sheridan.  On the other hand Lochley was rather rusty and her acting was worse than from the series.  And yes, she still doesn't seem to really fit in.

The dialog wasn't that bad.  It's obvious JMS wanted to mention all the dead characters and I kind of smiled when it was mentioned that G'Kar was beyond the rim.  It's not terrible slapstick wise guy dialog that plagues almost every show nowadays like Stargate.

Obviously, the budget was very small.  So how much could be done in terms of stories is debatable.  I'm sure JMS would've loved to put an epic battle or what not but where's the money?  The first story was a bit too religious and slow but it builds up to a somewhat decent ending.  The second story is much better than the first.  Not mind blowing but it's not the garbage that is released on tv nowadays.

Oh and I must mention the music.  It was great.  The music fit in perfectly and was very reminiscent of B5 but much more modern.  The ending theme was a rendition of the season 5 opening theme and fit very well with President Sheridan's last scene.

Maybe not 4 stars, but 3.5.  I really think this dvd is sort of like an introduction on what can be done later on in further dvds.  I feel JMS was restrained due to the very limited budget.  That is what I hope at least.  But not that terrible.  It is highly watchable especially if you're a B5 fan and usually i'm a somewhat harsh reviewer.",1186012800,,2968,4.3510054844606945
2823293,2,B000PHX8RA,"This is going to be a difficult review to write.  Let me begin by saying that I have a lot of respect for JMS and the original Babylon 5 series, and I'm glad that he's trying to bring it back.  If you're a B5 fan, you should buy this DVD.  I say that because if it sells well, then the next B5 DVD movie might actually be worthy of the B5 title--this one certainly was not.

It's clear that JMS had a meager budget to work with.  The number of sets could be counted on one hand, and they were all small and quite vacant.  Half of the scenes were virtual, filmed against a green screen.  Unfortunately, these digital backdrops were mostly still images with some moving people (or flying cars) injected to make it slightly less obvious that the backgrounds were completely static.  However, I was pleased that one of the virtual scenes--a futuristic New York cityscape--was very well executed for a low-budget production.

As expected, the CGI has improved dramatically since the original series.  It far outshines anything seen before in any B5 production, though it fails to match the realism of more recent sci-fi series like Firefly or Battlestar Galactica.  That said, the space scenes still look really cool, and the style is true to the show.

As for the story itself, I am utterly astonished that this was the best that JMS could come up with.  The 72-minute short movie is split into two discrete (and hardly related) storylines.  Both were quite weak.  It was as if JMS took two secondary plots out of two different B5 episodes and dragged each one out for just over a half hour by injecting a bunch of tiresome dialogue and redundant flashback sequences.  Neither of these stories could have stood on its own.  It would have made a lot more sense to me if JMS had just picked one storyline and developed it further.

The acting was mediocre, but this is hardly unexpected considering the actors hadn't played these roles for many years.  The weak script was definitely a key factor here, and since there were very few actors, there wasn't a lot of character interaction.  Overall, I think Peter Woodward (Galen) fared the best slipping into his old role, followed by Bruce Boxleitner (Sheridan).

Other than the main feature, there are a handful of short interviews and other extras on the DVD, including memorials to Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar) and Richard Biggs (Dr. Franklin).  While half of the extras consist of JMS rambling on pointlessly about sock puppets (seriously), some of them were fairly interesting.

As much as it pains me, I have to give this DVD two stars.  I considered giving it three stars, but I just tried to watch it again, and it was so uncaptivating that I ended up skipping through half of it.  Bottom line: if you're a B5 fan, you're pretty much obligated to buy this, but don't expect to enjoy it enough to watch it more than once.",1186012800,4,2866,4.627722772277227

As I watched, I was reminded of the original tv movie and of the piolot episode which sparked my favorite tv series.  At the begining, it was kind of meak.  Most of the opinions that I heard or read did not reflect well for the fledgling show.  It wasn't until much later that people saw it for the rich storyline and ensemble performance that it was.  I think this anthology has a great potential to spark a great collection of stories in this imaginative universe.  Although it was a little strange to not see the whole cast together as an ensemble, I thought the stories were great for a pilot scenario.  It would be woonderful to see the development of the available characters from both B5 and Crusade beyond the time of their respective series.  I did wish that colonel Lochely's character whould be explored more deaply as that is one of the least developed characters in the series.  It is my hope that in future instalments we will learn more about her.  I thought the visuals were very good. I hope to see more standing sets and props as the anthology continues rather than computer generated stages.  I think that will be more realistic if this becomes a serial antology.

2823306,4,B000PHX8RA,"I just watched the movie and I have to say that I loved it. Both the physical and 3D sets were well done, the acting was spot on, the stories were intriguing, well written, well acted, mellow, and cost effective. The special effects were very up to date with great looking detail. I loved the new ships, the short battle scene, and the ""feel"" of this movie. All in all while it wasn't an action packed movie persay, if had heart, and it filled me with a sense of welcome.  I think this movie was a very good start to what I hope will be many more direct to DVD B5 movies to come.",1186012800,2,579,4.078947368421052
2823307,2,B000PHX8RA,"Jerry Kindall summarized essentially what I felt like saying (thank you).

With all due respect to Babylon 5, the actors and, of course, JMS, this wasn't really a movie or a tale - it was a short story that didn't really have a lot of substance to work with.  When it ended, I was left feeling incredulous... as I expected some action or some semblance of what we all have come to know and love as Babylon 5.

The graphics were wonderful - did not look low-budget, and I'm really glad to see ""something"" of Babylon 5.  I realize there are resource restrictions, but I feel strongly that Babylon 5 has so much potential, there are so many more stories to tell - that's what made the experience so rich.  From the Vorlons and their mysterious motives and technology on through the Shadow race, etc.

I hope that JMS and his team can muster the resources to bring Babylon 5 back to some life.  We've missed it, and surely nothing can compare to it.

My hat still goes off to JMS and this Babylon 5 world he's created, and to the actors who made it possible (RIP Katsulas).",1186012800,3,1069,4.363636363636363
2823308,4,B000PHX8RA,"First of all, what are all of you who have given this a bad review wanting? The Shadows are gone, the Vorlons have left, since this is set 10 years after the end of the show, which would would set it right about the same time that Crusade would have ended, we can assume the Drahk are gone. There is no telepath war.

This really can't even be called a movie in it's own right, so Lost Tales is a good name. JMS told us what it was in the begining ( for anyone who knows where to look ). A series of planned ""short stories"" for on video (remember B5 was a novel for TV), centering on one or two characters in each. In what I would call a risky format, you can't just plop in a huge story. It wouldn't be right to start something that you might not get to finish in a way that would offer some closure to fans.

Moving on to the story, it is much smaller than any episode of the show. It re-introduces us to three of the characters of the Babylon 5 universe. The first focuses on Lockley ( think I got her name right ), and is a very interesting story. Babylon 5 often used religious themes in the show. It kind of plays out like a more cerebral Exorcist. The acting maybe wasn't the best, but the idea was solid. The second story features Sheridan and the technomage Galen ( from Crusade ). Great writing in this one. What I saw was JMS coming home to a character (Sheridan) and a universe he really cares about.

No big battles, no conspiracies, just some solid story telling. Stop looking for something that wasn't intended to be there. Enjoy it and more will follow.",1186012800,3,1569,4.1716171617161715

I show all of things to my non-B5 friends with pride, but this DvD and the Legend of the Rangers( Which by the way had nothing to do with the history of the rangers) is the only time i can say i was ashamed to be a B5 fan. This movie is not worth the money. Its really hard for me to say that because i love B5 more then any other sci-fi show ever made, so its very painfull to say that...i hate this movie with as much anger as i love the show(if that makes sense). I first thought that with babylon 5 coming out with a new movies(which it is not)that there would be rebirth of B5 and it would become bigger then ever and they would someday make a feature length movie. I really wanted this movie to make millions and millions, but i don't think that will happen. I won't say what happeneds in it because i hate people that give spoilers, but let me just say it you like a very,very slow paced movie getting religion shoved down your...well any were they can put it really and stories that mean nothing to the B5 univers. If you love all that then you will love this movie if not then you will feel the same way i did. I felt the whole first part was just like being stuck in a church and i could not get out(It was bad). I will end this now because this really unsets me i love B5 with all i am and I have shed many tears during the show but these are the only tear that i regret shedding. I hope this review helps you but its all up to you.",1186012800,8,1581,3.9283489096573208
2823310,4,B000PHX8RA,"I've never written a review on here but I want to write one for The Lost Tales.

I think it's great to see new Babylon 5 stuff with old characters again.  The legend of the Rangers was nice but had only G'Kar from the show.  This has more with Lochley, Sheriden and Galen.  It reminded me a little of Babylon 5: A call to arms with the small cast and dream sequences.  It'd be great to see Garibaldi, Delenn and others but it's a good step in the right direction.

The FX are very nicely done.  The battle sequence is only like 10 seconds but it freaked me out.  I'd love to see the shadow war done with this good of stuff.  Focusing in and out on Sheriden in the starfurry is neat and being able to actually see what a docking bay on Bablyon 5 is supposed to look like was very cool.  All of the shots on the original show were close ups of ships or people looking at ships.  This gives you a very big view and shows how ships move in and out.

I think the plot was good.  JMS could have tied them together like a show flashing back and forth  like A & B but it's fine the way it is.

For me Babylon 5 was never about one episode.  You can watch an episode here or there and some are great but most are ok.  On a single episode basis it'd have a hard time stacking up to any star trek, star gate galactica, farscape, etc. But when you look at the story arc and re-watch the episodes you go holy cow.  This thing ties together.  There's something in every episode that ties into the arc.  It's the only TV show that I know has ever done that and the only one where I cried at the end.  Instead of going from book to show like most good shows it went from JMS to show.  Keep that in mind when watching The Lost Tales.  As a show on it's own it's good.  If you've seen Babylon five, read some of the books, (primarily Legion of Fire trilogy), watched Crusade and some of the movies it's great.  If it's the beginning of another story arc then that's awesome.",1185926400,2,1956,4.03125
2823311,4,B000PHX8RA,"It's Babylon 5, without a doubt. The episodes were a bit quiet and much more philosophical than I was expecting -- and the use of green screen shows quite a bit in some places. On the other hand, the actual special effects are much better than anything in the show's past.

The DVD has two related, but separate stories -- more or less like episodes of the series. Was it good? Good enough (and much better than ""Legend of the Rangers"" or ""The River of Souls"".) I hope they make more.

For anyone griping about the price, do you or do you not want more Babylon 5? You're essentially funding the show (no network to interfere!) by buying the DVD.",1185926400,3,645,4.366666666666666
2823312,2,B000PHX8RA,"It's a shame that Babylon 5, unlike Star Trek, hasn't been kept alive through books.  Two excellent trilogies, the Psi Corps and the Centauri Prime books were published after the end of the show, but they didn't sell well and so no more were produced (there was another trilogy about the technomages, but I couldn't get into that one).

With filmed entertainment, you have to confront actor availability, sets, production design, and other technical issues.  In a book, G'Kar and Dr. Franklin can live forever; on film, they're gone, as the actors have passed away.

The idea of creating short films for direct-to-video release seems like a good one on paper, but this pair of stories has little to recommend it.  The first one is extremely slow and talky, and while it has the courage to bring up an interesting religious issue it does nothing new with the concept.

The second piece starts equally slowly, and is redeemed only by an interesting performance by the actor who plays the son of the late Centauri emperor.  Sheridan has to confront a dilemma forced upon him by technomage Galen, but there's never any doubt what Sheridan will ultimately do.  Still, there's enough tension to keep the story going for the few minutes that remain.

Because of the limitations of sets and crew, Babylon 5 feels ... abandoned.  There's a party going on, but the station still seems deserted.  There are no extras in the background loading cargo, or passengers arriving.  The epic sweep and texture of the series are not there.

B5 worked best when the arc was fully engaged, when one mystery led to another, when the variety of characters both alien and human gave the story a mythic dimension.  I don't think it works best with these brief, stand-alone stories that are more like stage plays than SF television.

Still, I don't regret having purchased it.  You pays your money and you takes your chances.  If there are more projects like this one I'll probably take a look, if only for nostalgic reasons.  But you're probably better off renting this one if you can.",1185926400,5,2059,4.768361581920904
2823313,5,B000PHX8RA,"""Lost Tales"" has the feel of a typical series pilot: relatively slow-paced, with lots of scenery shots and introductions.  The visual effects were excellent, with the Babylon 5 station itself never looking so real as it does now. I have to imagine that JMS had to blow a large part of his budget just creating the sets and bringing the Babylon 5 universe's CGI into the 21st century, so there wasn't a lot left over for loads of actors and action. But now that all that work laying the foundation has been done, the Powers That Be would be fools to not give the go-ahead for more ""Lost Tales"". I expect that future installments will indeed feature more characters and sets, and yes, action as well. Just give it some time.

If you are an action type of person, then this DVD will probably not be for you. However, if you are a thoughtful person, then, IMHO, you will love this DVD. If you are thoughtful, don't hesitate to buy it. It is much better than most of the thoughtless Sci-Fi drivel that gushes from various sources.

These short stories show that JMS must be getting too old and slowing down and not as good as he once was.

2823318,4,B000PHX8RA,"Got my copy courtesy of the good people at UPS today and well......I have to say that it was better then I thought it was going to be.

The main problem is that both installments were too short also theses are not ""Lost Tales"" so much as ""moral tales""

The first moral tale actually proposes an interesting question what exactly happens to our belife in god when we are confronted by the presence of aliens.  Will faith expand or diminish?  It was kind of like a cross between H.P Lovecraft and The Exorcist.  This will be the biggest bone of contention among the fans, those who don't necessarily believe in God will go Whaaa?  Demons that's just stupid.

The second Tale focuses on Sheridan and the choice he must make regarding a possible future and the life of one young man.  Galen also makes an appearance here (about time)

better then the first the ultimate resolution is going to create some problems with continuity.

All in all if they were considered as individual episodes better then seasons one and five not as good as 3-4.

In terms of the other movies not as good as In the Beginning or The Gathering but better then Thridspace or River of Souls.  I don't love these ""Lost Tales"" but I can't say I hate them either.

My main complaints would be the lack of time spent in the B5 universe (but this just shows how desperate I am for a fix) and the fact that the low budget showed almost no time was spent traveling from place to place all of the action was only confined to a single room.  Bottom Line here the low budjet shows.

Hopefully the sales will be good enough from these DVD's to kick start the series again so the next installment of the lost tales will not seem so abrupt.",1185926400,2,1699,4.383386581469648
2823319,3,B000PHX8RA,"Being a BIG fan of the entire Babylon 5 Catalog of products, I was over-joyed to see JMS returning to his baby and getting cleared to put out this series of Direct to DVD movies set in the B-5 universe.

Having now seen both episodes of ""Voices in the Dark,"" I can honestly say that both amount to shorter than normal, average episodes of the show.

The impressive opening sequence draws you back into the series in an explosive manner with an upbeat version of the anthem from Sleeping in Light and then tears into with the haunting haunting words of Andreas Katsulas as Gekas: ""I believe that when we leave a place, a part of it goes with us and part of us remains.""

It is probably the best possible opening to a new Babylon 5 project as any I could imaginable.  It's what follows that's somewhat disappointing.

The common theme here is the moral choices made by characters.  Both Father Cassidy and President John Sheridan have to choose between sacrificing an innocent soul in order to prevent future evils.  Both are tasked with making a choice that offers the choice of doing something evil for the greater good, or doing the right thing, knowing that future evil will be the result.

Over Here is centered around Lockley and is about a maintenance worker who has returned from vacation on Earth and brought along with him an unusual guest.  When the guest makes a surprising request of Lockley, she calls a priest.

There is a nice scene where Lockley Father Cassidy about faith, religion and the existence of God in which the Cassidy seems to have a very ""real world"" idea of the fate of his religion in the face of the ""facts"" of man's journey into the stars.  This is the BEST scene in the first half of Voices, the concept of the faithful priest having to weigh the options given to him by the unknown guest and also having to weigh his faith in god against his knowledge of the universe is very well handled, but from here it's downhill.

Tracy Scroggins is as wooden as ever and ends up uncovering a biblical style plot twist and resolves matters in an entirely anti-climatic way by doing something that most anyone would have done if in her shoes investigating such a bizarre occurrence.  She also talks to herself a LOT.  Most of her dialog seems to be with herself.

One walks away from Over Here with one real question.  ""Why did it take so long for this particular issue to come up when man had been journeying into the star for over 200 years in the Babylon 5 universe?""  Unfortunately there are no answers for that here.  But at least we're on to Over There.

Over There is the Sheridan centered story in which Peter Woodward, as Gaylen once again brings Sheridan a warning about the impending doom of humanity at the hands of an unseen foe.  Only this time, Gaylen asks Sheridan to do the unthinkable, invoking the idea of killing Hilter as a youth before he could grow up to become the leader of the Nazi Party.

Thus we have Sheridan having to weigh the options of doing the morally reprehensible thing or allowing the potential future deaths of ""billions"" by doing nothing.

This is definitely the better half of an overall average package and worth the price of admission.

The special effects are definitely MUCH better than most of the stuff previously done in the Babylon 5 series or movies.  Some of the scenes have that ""George Lucus"" problem of people feeling wooden because they are being shot on a Green Screen and have nothing around them to ""put them in the scene.""  But the effects really are top notch for a direct to video production.  The Music is pretty good here thanks to Christopher Franke who returns to the series in top form.  And most of the returning characters don't seem to have missed a beat, even Scroggins has the same wooden acting...

If you're a big fan of Babylon 5, then go ahead and get this and be happy that there is potential in the future for bigger and better things.  if you're not a fan or you want to be a fan, get the original series instead.",1185926400,3,4012,4.495172413793103

The first story is played out like a stage play. Most of the time it is only three characters interacting with each other in a dark room, no set except for some chairs.  I felt no 'Babylon 5' in this story.  My wife was able to get past the lack of a set and concentrate on the dialogue, but even she admitted that the direction was weak.  If you can get past the first story you will find the second story refreshing, if feels like it could be a pilot for a new series.  There are more sets & characters to keep the story interesting.

2823324,5,B000PHX8RA,"This new DVD release of 'Babylon 5-The Lost Tales' is a welcome return to a show that many consider one of the best Sci Fi shows ever to have graced television.
The ""Lost Tales' of the title consists of two vignettes,if you will,that are held together by a thread of the narrative/plot. The first concerns the demonic possesion of a crew member which Capt. Lochley(Tracy Scoggins) with the help of a priest(Alan Scarfe,lately of Andromeda) has to contend with. This segment raises many philosophical questions about religion and the future of it and our place in it in the future.
The second segment concerns President Sheridans' return to B-5 to attend the 10th anniversary of the alliance. Along the way our/his pesky technomage Galen(Peter Woodward)returns with a view of what could be Earths' future demise. Sheridan is(delightful to watch!) peeved off at his return and tells him to get lost,but to no avail. It seems the ""message"" is too important and  Sheridan must take steps to do something before it occurs. The technomage recommends a path but,as usual,Sheridan takes his own,much to his(the technomages')chagrin. Will it be enough,will it work?
The roughly 70 minute show ends as we all ponder his decision and he walks toward the anniversary celebrations on B-5. It leaves us with alot of unanswered questions and possibilities for the future of the B-5 universe and it leaves it wide open for more future B-5 movies(or another series?).
I have seen an interview recently at AOL with Mr. Straczynski in which he states that the bottom line as to whether or not anything further develops from this is dependant solely on its' sales and the response it garners.
Well I for one was left salivating for more after the 70 minutes of this movie came to its' very(seemingly) swift conclusion. So I can only hope all you B-5 fans out there will join me in getting this excellent and newest part of the B-5 Universe,you will not be disappointed.
As a footnote there some neat extras in this DVD.There are interviews with Mr. Stracynski,Mr. Boxleitner,Tracy Scoggins and Peter Woodward. There is a 'fireside chat' with the producer who answers a slew of fan questions and there are two touching memorial segments dedicated to the memories of actors Richard Biggs(Dr. Franklin) and Andrea Katsulas(G'Kar) who passed away in 2004 and 2006 respectively.

2823325,4,B000PHX8RA,"Wonderful to have new Babylon 5 episodes to watch again.  J. Michael Straczynski created the best Sci Fi TV series ever made and he both writes and directs this new DVD.  I agree that I wanted more meat on the bones for these two short semi-interwoven episodes and it would have been nice to have more than 4 or 5 extras in the whole movie, but the story telling is fine.  More than just an appetizer, more like a good first course.  Hopefully the acting talent budget is larger next time (and that this DVD turns out to indeed be just the first in a long series of others to follow).

One place the producers did not skimp was on the CGI.  Babylon 5 NEVER looked so good, and the effects were stunning.  Another place where they didn't skimp was on extras (DVD extras, that is).  There are probably more minutes of extras on the disc than there are minutes of story.  Some of the extra segments are a bit weak (JMS brings you sock puppet theater!?!?), but the two in memorium pieces for Richard Biggs and for Andreas Katsulas were wonderful.",1185926400,3,1042,4.385416666666667
2823336,2,B000PHX8RA,"I have always been a huge fan of Babylon 5 and I just finished watching The Lost Tales last night. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed in the two tales presented on the DVD. I'll point out my three problems with the disc:

First, the main menu was a bit confusing. ""Over Here"" and ""Over There"" are the choices for the two individual tales. It took me a second to realize this.

Second, both tales left me wanting. They were too short and only just began to flush out the stories before they ended rather quickly. Supporting characters were virtually non-existent (more so in the second tale) and the sets were also limited (my perception). The stories felt unfinished.

Third, the premise of the first tale sort of caught me off guard. It was very religious (Christian), and felt out of place even though the original series did delve into religious themes more than once. I don't know, it just rubbed me wrong and was not very satisfying.

Now, all of these things are highly subjective. They are why the tales did not work for me and why I regret spending my money on this DVD. This may not be true for you.",1185926400,6,1117,4.514851485148514
2823337,5,B000PHX8RA,"Well this was a real treat for B5 fans! A spinoff of the original series that feels like the best of the original series. I was never all that fond of the spinoff projects (with the exception of the exceptional ""In the Beginning"") like ""River of Souls"", ""Thirdspace"" and (especially) ""Legend of the Rangers"". Despite having seen most of them 2 or 3 times, I found them unmemorable. And although ""Crusade"" had potential, it will always feel like unfinished business.

But these new ""Lost Tales"" standalone stories really took me back to what was best about B5 when it was at its best. I thought the two stories were exceptionally clever and compelling, and the theme that seems to tie them (don't take choices at face value) reflects J. Michael Straczynski's writing at its best. Turns out he a pretty great director too!

Other elements: video and audio quality was immaculate; visual effects were wonderful, it's so nice to see the B5 universe re-rendered with today's quality SFX; lovely score by Christopher Franke that has great subtle and epic moments; very good performances by most of the cast, especially Boxleitner and Woodward, who just slip back into their characters and feel like a comfy sweater; wonderful fanservice in the stories and in the extras (especially for our friends who have left us).

My only criticism: I think they need more extras if there are more TLT DVDs (yes please!). The scenes on the station itself feel very sparse, like everyone is on vacation or something. It feels ""wrong"", especially when so many of the scenes are character and conversation heavy, small intimate scenes in rooms between two characters. The scenes in hallways and on the hanger of the station needed to be a reminder of not only how big the station is, but how busy it is as well. I think that without ""B stories"" in these scripts, that visual element would have heightened the drama of the smaller, more important scenes.

I hope this is the first of many of these DVDs, thought I fear JMS is just going to be too darn busy with his exploding career to give us more. OTOH, the man is a workaholic, so perhaps the future is bright.",1185926400,7,2140,4.698666666666667
2823338,3,B000PHX8RA,"Very short -- 35 minutes per segment. The two stories are weak, like a secondary thread running through the main plot in a typical episode of the series,except the main plot is missing.  The first is just a rehash of all the old exorcism tales we've had in film and TV for decades.  Good acting but very poor, obvious storyline and dialog that tends towards the silly.  It's trivial.  The second story, centered on Boxleitner/Sheridan (good to see him in this role again!) was a tad better but centered around a teenager, thus seemed childish for the most part.  There were too few characters per story.  Each centered around only three to four actors with barely no extras or aliens.  B5 seemed virtually deserted. Special effects were good, particularly the beginning when B5 was destroyed and then taken back in time and reassembled. When scenes showed a mythical destruction of Earth, I wondered what happened to the Drak plague that was let loose in the last B5 TV movie? It seemed like JMS forgot about his own plotline!  So many of us were enthused about this revisit to our favorite SF show -- I think a good many will be disappointed.  If we want to revive B5, it might be time to take it out of the creator's hands and get someone who can stick with the old spirit and strengths of the series.",1185840000,6,1303,4.534188034188034
2823339,5,B000PHX8RA,"If the objective of ""Babylon 5:  The Lost Tales"" was to tell small, intimate, character based stories then this DVD must be considered a success.

The ""Lost Tales"" is an anthology set in the Babylon 5 universe.  It consists of two stories.  The first involves Col. Lochley and deals mainly with how religion and spirituality in general, cope in a universe that is increasingly becoming ever more secular.  It is thought provoking and adds another layer of depth to the ongoing dialogue that the show has had with religion.  It leaves a few questions unanswered (I won't spoil anything).  But that did not detract from my enjoyment of the show.  Of the two stories the second one stands out.  This story deals with a moral dilemma that ISA President Sheridan must face as he travels back to Babylon 5 for the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the ISA. Both Bruce Boxleitner and Peter Woodward do an excellent job breathing life back into their old characters of Sheridan and the Techno-mage Galen.  The dialogue is great and features several moments of humor and sarcasm.  The actors must have had fun with it.  The conclusion of this episode is especially satisfying.

On the negative side, it is apparent that this production did not have a huge budget.  One could argue that the small cast suited the tone of the stories; however it would be nice to see more money in any future installments.  However the CGI was excellent.  Babylon 5 itself never looked this good before(especially on a 52"" LCD widescreen).

As a long time fan of the Babylon series I came away from this wanting more",1185840000,8,1595,4.721014492753623
2823340,4,B000PHX8RA,"I really enjoyed this!!!  I've been a huge fan since about 1997 or so (it took me a while to figure out out what season I was in while watching it since it didn't play in any sort of proper sequence untll TNT carried it).

The visual effects are top notch and the story telling is as well.  As an anthology series based in the Babylon 5 Universe I really expected to see more insight into the characters post the original 5 year story arc, and damn, did JMS deliver.

Lochley and Sheridan add a lot of gravitas to the shows as well as the Technomage Galen (looking forward to seeing more of Peter Woodward for sure).

Hopefully, we'll see more of the repercutions of the Shadow War as well as the lost stories of the Excalibur and the Drakh Plague.  I'd also like to see more of the stories that have only been hinted at regarding the Telepath War as well as the eventual demise of Emperor Londo Molari!

2823341,1,B000PHX8RA,"I love B5, I loved almost all of the movies (Legend of the Rangers stunk), but this?  This makes Legend of the Rangers look like a classic Bogart flick.  The story was poorly written and had nothing to do with expanding on the storyline of the series.  It had nothing to do with anything B5.  Its only purpose is the stealing of money from unsuspecting fans wanting a plot, some relevance, and maybe a little action.  Save your time and money and pass on this DVD.  I sincerely hope JMS will think about any future projects and avoid the huge mistake of making this DVD, 1 star is way too much for this epic joke.",1185840000,14,613,4.28695652173913
2823342,4,B000PHX8RA,"Well, I did enjoy this ""movie"", but it really was 2 short episodes, or short stories, that just showed the viewer what is going on in the B5 universe.  However, the other movies, Legend Of The Rangers, Thirdspace, Call To Arms, etc..., were much better.  This ""movie"" was nice to see, but it was just a glimps into the B5 Universe.  After watching this movie, you will leave vaguely satisfied, and wishing for a LOT more.

Please understand that I will purchase every B5 DVD that comes out, and I do not want to sound like I didn't enjoy this movie, I DID!  The problem is that it's just too short!  (IMHO)",1185840000,3,606,4.366071428571429
2823343,5,B000PHX8RA,"If you enjoyed the original B5 and related JMS projects you will enjoy this latest rendition. I am thrilled with this endeavor, its results, and hope for MORE!!

Yes it's not the original B5 in splendor with a large cast and multiple studio sets. But it is a great example of what a small cast with talent, a good story, and a super CGI computer can put forth.

You really cannot compare this effort with five years of full scale production. Sure, we all hope to see that caliber of quality entertainment again. But that requires lots of folks, lots of room, and lots and lots of big money. Yes it could happen, but in the mean time, this idea of limited resource production has its merits. It got my blood pumping again with B5 interest and my wallet open and ready for more.

So it's not the full scale grandeur of yester year. What ever is? Who ever fully lives up to old expectations? Not many. This DVD and concept is very good and worthy of attention. I would like to see these and other longer types of stories being released several times a year.

Has this ""limited production"" DVD idea matures; I would expect them to progressively get ""richer"" in content and delivery and more popular. It's a great idea. Hat's off to JMS and Doug, and whoever else is in on this. I think it's a winner with not only B5 but other venues as well. This seems to be a natural first step toward full CGI production, characters included. Endless possibilities abound. Best Wishes.

P.S. Stories are good, Acting is good to excellent, CGI cool, Music very good. It was GREAT to have those B5 goose bumps again!! THANKS JMS and ALL. More Please More!!!!

2823344,3,B000PHX8RA,"My wife and I are both big B5 fans and have been since the first season.  We have all the DVDs available and were really looking forward to new episodes.  That said, we weren't exactly enthralled by the first segment on Lost Tales with Lockley on the station.  For all JMS's statements about being an athiest, it was all God, demons, church, beliefs, etc..  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't up there with the episodes from the series either.  The second segment with Galen was much more interesting, but again, not up there with the best episodes.  The CGI was fantastic.  The details on the ships and the station were outstanding.  I freeze framed several times just to gaze at the details of the station.

For a B5 fan, by all means, go for it.  If this is your intro to the B5 universe, you'd be better off starting elsewhere.",1185840000,3,825,4.44
2823345,3,B000PHX8RA,"It was indeed interesting; essentially a pair of short stories that expose a bit more about Lockley, Sheridan, and Galen.  It is certainly filled with all of the obvious revelations, quite elegantly giving remembrance to those that have gone ""Beyond the Rim.""

It exposes an interesting edge of Lockley's character that *is* surprising, as she demonstrates a spiritual understanding that we'd associate more with Jeffrey Sinclair.

I *think* that this subplot also points towards the way the Rangers would eventually be involved with rebuilding things (as seen in The Deconstruction of Falling Stars at the end of Season 4), as there is an elliptical reference to the notion that the Church still feels they have worthwhile things ""up their sleeves.""  Unfortunately, if I'm right, well, that was perhaps a bit too obvious.

The second story, filled with veiled references to what we already know about what is to happen in the Centauri Empire, seems to me to fall down in this regard.  It *appears* to reveal things, but nothing that is really overly surprising.  Sheridan is presented, by Galen, a moral dilemma (and Galen is shown off as being really rather nasty), but to me, it's NOT one that is really challenging, as he had rather more difficult ones to deal with during the course of the main series. And that is one half of what disappoints.

The other half is that, as a standalone pair of stories, this story is missing the ""arc"" rewards that the series offered.  It has plenty of brief connections into the details of both past and future, but can't make promises of what is yet to come, which was one of the great joys of the 5 year arc.  During the series, they had many revelations; they had to pay dearly for them.

Now, even a ""pretty bad"" set of Straczynski stories (and this isn't actually bad) are generally better than most of the drek out there.  But I don't think this was nearly his best, alas.",1185840000,5,1917,4.723723723723723
2823346,1,B000PHX8RA,"I was greaty looking forward to re-visiting the Babylon 5 universe. There are many tales only hinted at during the main show which had a lot of potential. The direct-to-DVD method I think has promise. I like the idea of funding future 'episodes' through purchasing DVDs. However, the story quality was poor. The visuals were poor. I wish I could return it and get my money back. I feel cheated. I read much of JMS' pre-show hype and I just don't see it on the screen. Maybe I missed something, maybe I'm being too harsh, but it really wasn't a good use of my money. Now this leaves me in a quandry, if my dollars fund future DVDs would I buy them? I'd like that method, and Babylon 5, to suceed. But I would not buy another in this series, hopefully I could rent it first. It's just sad this is what has happened to the show. I can't think of many positives. It was nice to see Galen and Sheridan in action again, albiet briefly. The CGI and music was nice, but all that adds up to a minute or two of screen time. The 75 minute running time should have created a high paced show, but instead it floundered around like a dead fish in a big white room. It's sad that 'fans' will have to purchase this by their very definition. I wanted to post this review though in case there are some people on the fence, seeing the bad reviews, and I strongly urge you to use the money for something else.",1185840000,13,1389,4.225563909774436
2823347,3,B000PHX8RA,"I looked forward to this release, but with a great deal of trepidation.  B5 has had a somewhat checkered past after the original series finished.  Some of the follow on movies and series have left a great deal to be desired.  This movie/special/whatever it is falls somewhere in between.  It's really two stories lightly stitched together.

The first tale has a very interesting premise.  It revolves around demons and religion and how they translate once man has left earth.  Unfortunately, I had to pull all of that out of some bad dialogue, and at sometimes slow pacing and at others rushed.  It also suffers from a distinct lack of extras.  For some place that is supposed to be this huge mix of species, and cultures, it looked like everyone had taken a vacation.  The set was practically empty except for one or two extras.  It felt like a big empty space station that the main characters walked through by themselves.  Just because you can do CGI, doesn't mean you have too.

The second tale was stronger than the first.  It dealt with President Sheridan having to make a decision about the life of a Centauri prince.  It felt more like the old show.  The acting was much stronger, and it included my favorite character Galen.  It also lacked for extras, and the sets felt empty.  I felt the story itself was boring.  The president has to make a big decision to save the world...seen it...seen it several times...pretty much every episode.  He's a good guy.  We get it.

Overall, it's kind of nice to see the characters on the screen, but it just didn't seem to flesh out the universe much.  The stories were better than watching Delenn sort the recycling, or Garabaldi negotiating his next business contract, but they didn't seem much more important.  I would love to see what the technomages are up too, or how the drakh plague was cured on earth.  Maybe they could go back in time and do some shows on the telepath war or mars independence.  For such a deep universe, these stories seem to be more like weak filler episodes from the original series.",1185840000,3,2059,4.6187845303867405

First story - 2 persons , playing bad, talk ..., sometimes look at 3rd person, sometimes some cheap blurred CGI shown. Thats it - cheap set , no idea , no story , some strange religious ""drift"" , Lockly played bad, the priest did not played at all, just read the monologs.

Second story is better , almost up to the level of episode in B5, but one of the side episodes in B5. But at least it had idea, the big downside that both Sheridan and Galen (2 man show here again) characters are somehow without depth.

DVD itself also made badly , after WB we get some strange ""how Superman (or was it Spiderman?) movie was created"" thing (good thing I thinked of ""menu"" button at that moment).
Then we have menu where we have ""Voices in the Dark"" entry on top that start first ""novel"" and ""here"" and ""here"" (literally) buttons under it , when ""here"" buttons takes you to the same first story.

2823350,1,B000PHX8RA,"sorry to bust up the party but i just watched lost tales and i have to say this was dissapointing to say the least.
all i can say is that JMS only has himself to blame on this one. he has always played up his role as an underdog. b-5 was the show that was made in spite of the industry. i just watched b-5 last summer and it was awesome. season 5 was o.k but seemed to focus on secondary elements. it was a shame because they faught hard to get the show back and didn't give the fans what they had waited for. if you like b-5 you can watch season 5 and enjoy it for what it is. but its golden baylon-5 compared to the lost tales.

i have never seen crudsade but im familiar with the story of its production.
the network tampered with the show. they didn't let jms do what he wanted etc...

but those days are over. jms had a great oprtunity here. and he had the support.

the network (wb) came through. he got a shot to produce a movie on his own terms.
the acting was there. the effects were there. b-5 has never LOOKED so good.
we get a wealth of extras. ""making of"" doccumentaries.
two memorial segments ALMOST make the disc worthwhile.

the only thing missing is a good story.
and the only person who dropped the ball is jms.

he dropped the ball for b-5 and for sci-fi/fantasy in general.
this was the great experiment.
produce the before frowned upon ""direct to dvd"" release of something ACTUALLY good.
prove its a viable medium for serious original material.

the fans are there. best buy only had one copy left when i got there today about an hour after they opened.

i wanted this to be good.
it didn't even have to be great.
but it's boring.
if your gonna skip a big cast and work a dialogue driven story then you need to write good material.
it seemed jms was more interested in listing himself as writer, director, and producer.
...to prove he could go back to b-5.

2823351,5,B000PHX8RA,"Worth the money twice. Really.  I suppose one would need to have a grounding in the series- be a fan as it were- to appreciate some references, and that is, I imagine, as intended.  For Me, I got goosebumps in the first 30 seconds  and about 3 minutes in felt a great apprehension that perhaps this was heading south - O not at all! (so now I know better than to give any credence to those nay saying reviewers who preceded me) By the end I felt as involved and entertained as could possibly have hoped.
The first story is a bit wordy  but if you know JMS's work it's far from out of line and it stays well within the traditions of B5. It's thought provoking and a nice change from so much TV today.  The Second is classic. I look forward to more of these. This release, while done on a budget, is entirely successful at returning to the B5 universe and enriching it- what more could I possibly want?  I can't commend all concerned enough.
Now... that said... being on a budget, there are some funny minor visual gaffes that are rather endearing. My favorite being Sheridan marching past the Midgets in the hanger at the end.

2823352,1,B000PHX8RA,"I have only managed to sit through the first half of this so far. Sleep beckoned. But that half was sufficient to convince me that this is not a worthy addition to the Babylon 5 franchise. Slow, full of trademark long, boring speeches with delusions of grandeur, and a plot speed stuck in first gear it is only saved by the excellent music soundtrack by Chris Franke, and fond memories of older, better examples of what this show used to be (I want it back, I want it all back the way that it was). If you're building a complete collection of B5 franchise material, then by all means add this. Otherwise don't bother. There are better, more entertaining sci-fi offerings out there on which to spend your Amazon vouchers!

This is not Babylon 5. It hasn't the scale, it hasn't the scope, it hasn't the excitement or the consequences or the ""hooks"" that (at least the first four series of) B5 had. Dialogue containing long lists of characters *not* appearing (""Delenn had something to do"" - Puhlease!) in the episodes does not substitute for any of the above.

I am sadly disappointed. Faith may manage, but it's not always enough. Sometimes, it is necessary to deliver. And this doesn't :-(

UPDATE: I have now finished the DVD, and it's headed back where it came from. It is *such* a disappointment. I have a fairly low opinion of the writer at the best of times, but he's outdone himself this time. Awful. Absolutely, cringemakingly awful.

And the ""humour"" in the extras? Oh dear. Unfunny self indulgence, and merely serving nicely to illustrate how up himself the writer is. The memorials to Andreas Katsulas and Richard Biggs, although well-meaning turned out to be little more than extended chats. Far better memorial videos have been done by fans of the show and would have been better used here.

2823353,3,B000PHX8RA,"(If you're going to rate this review, I'd respectfully ask that you read it before rating it, rather than simply reacting on the basis of how many stars I gave this).

I wish I could rate this five stars. I really do. (very minor spoilers). If you are a serious fan of the series. While you may in part be disappointed, you will also rejoice. If you are a more casual fan or a general SF fan, then... I'm sadly not sure I can recommend this. I'd be inclined to recommend one of the earlier B5 movies, such as the prequel, In the Beginning.

The Good?
Great opening, some fine acting from Boxleitner and occasionally outstanding writing. Generally excellent special effects.

The Bad?
Dialogue that, in the wrong voice, often seems overly dramatic, comic-book style. Very low budget, with next to nothing for extras, costumes (Sheridan flying a Starfury in a business suit?), and sets. Almost painfully low-budget very flat two-dimensional CGI in place of some sets that made it look like a (good) fan production (the docking bay in particular).

Make no mistake though, given these limitations, JMS does an excellent job of putting it all together.

The opening is magnificent. Lovely special effects, a nicely redone station, with a lot more detail and a fantastic nebula in the background. The lovely atmospheric B5 music is back.

It opens, rolling back through the years from the station's demolition in the final episode of the series to the setting of the timeframe of these two tales.

Movingly, the voice of the great Andreas Katsulas, who played G'Kar speaks over this opening. It's very touching, all the more so given the death of the actor.

We see stills of Londo, G'Kar, Delenn and Lennier, and Kosh with Christopher Franke's soundtrack setting the mood.

Then... it begins.

And, sadly, so does the disappointment.

The spaces are generally very confined; even when a large space exists, it is generally executed with CGI. This makes things appear oddly cramped, confined, which is rather sad in such an expansive universe with such an expansive story-teller as JMS.

The first story seemed quite weak to me, salvaged only by some excellent acting on the part of Bruce Ramsay. Some of the exposition that Tracy Scoggins pumped out seemed particularly strained, and she came off to me as someone simply playing a role, as did the Priest. Was it the writing? Was it the acting? A mixture of both, I think.

The second story came off much stronger. Boxleitner really made me feel he was Sheridan, back in full. Keegan MacIntosh did a very credible turn (accent and all) as a young Centauri Prince.

In much of this story, JMS made a virtue of necessity, having a scene on an empty soundstage dressed simply by two chairs and a spotlight, as a ""Minbari viewing room"". It worked impressively well. Even so, the lack of extras and regular cast, especially greeting Sheridan on his return to B5 and the off-the-camera crowd came off as quite weak, as did Sheridan's turn at Starfury in a business suit.

All-in-all it came off as a fairly well-written and reasonably well-executed play. I don't think there ever more than four people on screen at once, and often only two. It felt small, confined.

To any serious fan I recommend this. You'll enjoy it as I did, even if parts may disappoint you. If you're buying a gift for a serious fan of B5, this is worth picking up as well.

To those who aren't hardcore fans, I'd recommend starting with either the series or perhaps the prequel movie, In the Beginning.",1185753600,14,3516,4.747126436781609

I have a hint that the forementioned memorials will be quite emotional, for the losses of Andreas Katsulas and Richard Biggs won't ever heal. I own the Complete Babylon 5 Universe, wich I think wasn't released in the US, only in the UK, and I sure do hope one day my children will be able to learn from the series as I have.
To many it may seem that a TV show would never have meaningful content from wich we could learn from, but Babylon 5 crossed a line that very few productions, including literature, have, that is to leave to the observer how he will apply or interpret the lessons and situations presented, according to personal experience, other than leading to an obvious road that everyone should follow. In my opinion, Joseph Scraczynski is either a brilliant man that learned how to accomplish this, or a natural genius that has mastered this technique and doesn't even realise it.
I am quite sure that The Lost Tales will not please everyone, as it was never intended to do so, but almost a decade after the end of the original series, it will certainly be refreshing and fun.

2823355,5,B000PHX8RA,"10 years have passed since the end of Babylon 5 and we (fans) have been fortunate to get another taste of the B5 universe. I have seen a few bad reviews posted here and some of them were writen well before the DVD was even released. Some of the more recent bad reviews since are from a few who managed to see it before the official U.S. release. I have been fortunate to see it a few days early as well.

While I recongnize that everyone is entitled to their opinion, be very skeptical of anyone who claims to be a fan of the Babylon 5 universe and yet still manages to write a bad review of this DVD. Before or after they have seen it.

First of all, the creator (JMS) and the show itself are landmarks in acheivement. JMS wrote about 90% of the show's five seasons, while also managing to keep it on air against greedy network folks, and as I heard it, produced one of the only sci-fi shows to ever repeatedly price out at, or under, its alloted budget constraints. ALL of this and it is still one of the best sci-fi shows ever, both in characters and plot. Farscape faced similar challenges several years later. JMS arguably defeated his Star Trek competition through much better continuity, plot, character devolopment,and story arcs. I never found any continuity errors between the show's episodes or in any of the other B5 media (comics and books).

It it here where I offer my opinion in favor of this DVD.

Yes, it is shorter than two episodes are normally. Yes the production sets are a little spartan. And yes, the two episodes don't add much to the established story-arc.

My point? Who cares! Anyone who is a dedicated fan to Babylon 5 should know it was the story that keep fans returning, not the length or special effects. The story was what made this show great, and what makes this new DVD great.

This DVD shows that JMS can still write and produce a thought provoking and stellar story after all these years, on a budget. I actually think 95% of the sets in these two shows were blue screen and CGI. But hey, if he can come in under budget, that maximizes the studio's profit margin and he can make more stories if the DVD sales are sufficient. Meaning better chances for JMS to produce more DVD stories, some of which may be larger contributors to the established story-arc. Maybe even a new series or spin-off.

I know that it was tried before (Crusade and Legend of...), but the world's taste in entertainment has changed since then. Sci-fi is in the mainstream due to the Matrix Trilogy, Star Wars, all the comicbook movies, and various TV shows (Battlestar, Farscape) in the last decade. Babylon 5 is back, and the consumers are the voice of whether it stays. Buy the DVD.

I would like to see more, and will enjoy this DVD when mine comes. I hope you all enjoy this when you see it.",1185580800,10,2807,4.426356589147287
2823356,2,B000PHX8RA,"First off: the special effects have never looked better, especially given how bad they looked on the DVD release of the original series.

That said, this is a disappointing offering. The low budget of this direct-to-DVD release really shows; the scenes in which characters talk about the people who won't be able to make the 10-year anniversary of the Interstellar Alliance are painful. Okay, the actors who played G'Kar and Dr. Franklin have passed on, so that's understandable. But then Garibaldi's trying to make it but might not be able to get away from Mars; Emperor Mollari doesn't want to leave the palace and sends a Centauri prince in his stead; and then it turns out Delenn is indisposed too (undoubtedly her turn as Crazy French Lady on ""Lost"" has raised Mira Furlan's asking price significantly). From the original show, then, we get Boxleitner, Scoggins, and Peter Woodward (who, in case you don't recognize the name, plays the technomage Galen); the rest are unknowns. (Props to Keegan MacIntosh, who plays the Centauri prince, for at least essaying something of an accent.) Christopher Franke returns to do the music and uses rather less of that ""broinnngggg"" synth sound he used to use.

The sets are spare; one scene takes place entirely in the ""viewing room"" of a Minbari starship, i.e., an empty soundstage lit with a couple of spotlights. The Babylon 5 station itself consists of a couple of rooms and a corridor and is so stripped down that it's only recognizable because of its weird door shapes. All the sets look virtually abandoned due to the almost total lack of extras. There are fake people in the vast B5 docking bay -- standing stock still -- and there's a huge crowd scene entirely off-camera. In one sequence, it's clear the wardrobe budget was tight, too; they couldn't afford to spring for vacuum suits, leaving Sheridan piloting a Starfury in a suit (shades of ""Gattaca""). Lampshades are hung, but it's impossible to ignore all the corners that were cut.

I could still be sucked in if the stories were any good, but unfortunately they are not. Most of the actors are a little rusty or stiff (except for Woodward, who is great) and both stories are very slowly paced, with little action -- and in some places they are padded beyond credulity. I was ready to throw a shoe at Lochley and the priest with their incessant reiteration of each other's conclusions. There's a stunning space battle sequence and another dramatic CGI scene in New York, but the space battle is only a few seconds long and both scenes turn out to be, essentially, dream sequences. Footage is reused in flashbacks to things we just saw a few minutes previously. What we have here would have been a single episode of the original show (at 40-something minutes), and the utterly silly first story would have been the B-plot, just a problem to annoy Lochley as she prepared for Sheridan's arrival -- and it would have been far better that way. Even so, it would have been only an average episode at best.

I was a big supporter of B5 when it was originally on the air and still have my original ""Accept No Substitutes"" shirt that JMS offered to GEnie members. I am sure that JMS did the best he could with the resources he had, and can see that the series has the potential to improve in future installments as the actors settle in and they have the budget to build some additional sets. Unfortunately, this first release is not exactly going to bring people back for more. It may be argued that even low-budget B5 is better than no B5, but really, the show (while groundbreaking for its time) has been more than surpassed by its successors, any one of which you could watch instead (Firefly? Galactica?). Since this release fails to capture much of the original show's feel, it's not really even good for nostalgia. Two stars: one for attempting it at all, a second for the excellent CGI work (which doesn't look low-budget).",1185580800,322,3930,4.724489795918367
2823357,2,B000PHX8RA,"Like many fans of B5, I was excited to hear of the Lost Tales and yes I saw JMS at NY Comic Con, too.

I just finished watching The Lost Tales and can't even put into words how disappointing it is.

Call me old fashioned but I don't enjoy a whole CGI release.  The people are real at least, well for the most part.

Ugh, I am just too disgusted to write anymore!",1185580800,10,362,3.9178082191780823
2823358,5,B000PHX8RA,"It astounds me how many reviews we already have on this, and it's not even out yet. For those that have given it one or two stars, I've set mine at a 5. How can you possibly rate it low when you've not seen it? To be fair, I shouldn't rate it a 5 either, but again, I feel compelled to counterbalance the 1s and 2s who cannot possibly know if it's good or bad.

No, it's not a 5-year arc. Duh. There are no false pretenses here, it was billed as a single shot story from the beginning. If you followed what JMS has said about The Lost Tales, it was not intended to be feature length stories. Yes, some of the ""non-arc, stand-alone"" stories from the original B5 were uneven, as JMS himself admits! But a bad B5 is better on a good day than the ""best"" of so many other series that I'll take it.

Okay -  now I've seen it. I'm sticking with my 5-star rating. Perhaps because I've been following the postings by JMS about The Lost Tales, I knew what to expect. Basically two standalone episodes of Babylon 5, done on a shoestring budget. I thought the stories were enjoyable. Yes, it's got a lot of CGI, but so did the show, which really pioneered the use of CGI in a weekly television series. I find the comments about the use of ""too much"" CGI to be really odd. But it's the stories, not the special effects, that matter here. Yes, everything is very minimalist, including and most especially the cast. Not exactly surprising, again, given what was posted by JMS that they were operating on a shoestring budget and extremely tight schedule. If you're really a B5 fan you should know this! The only bad thing is the menu, which is poorly executed.",1185494400,10,1644,4.296774193548387
2823359,2,B000PHX8RA,"I loved the show and was really looking forward to this - POINTLESS.
Why make this ridiculous DVD?  72 minutes after all these years?
Okay the 2 stories are MILDLY interesting but there is NO POINT.  Maybe if they are about to start something new ?
Make a real freakin' movie or mini-series but please - don't waste my time and money on junk like this.",1185408000,4,352,4.318181818181818
2823360,2,B000PHX8RA,"wuddu wasta time we have here, just a lot of pointless stories that do not tie in with the regular season except for showing a few characters here and there and failed marriages.  Like we care about that at this point in the timeline?  I think everyone giving this thing 5 stars is smoking something and it is STRONG becuz this really duz not add much to the overall B5 story.",1185408000,5,376,4.28169014084507
2823361,4,B000PHX8RA,"Today is the 24th July 2007 and did I have a surprise parcel in the post this morning. I heard about Babylon 5 the Lost Tales several months ago and made sure that I pre-ordered it ASAP. I was surprised today because, I live in the UK, I'm British and have been a Babylon 5 fan since it first came to our screens in the mid 1990's. I watched every episode when they were first shown in the UK on Channel 4, and the T.V movies that were shown on Sci-Fi and I have been eagerly awaiting new Babylon 5 since the ill-fated Crusade and Legend of the Rangers. This morning the new DVD came through my door.

I did not expect to receive it untill a few days after it's release in the U.S. not a full week before. I have tried the DVD in my non-region free player and the disc plays perfectly. It does not seem to be region encoded, which is good news for those who wish to own it as a region 2 release date has yet to be announced.

The DVD is well packaged. The two stories told can be viewed induvidualy or as a whole movie. The rendering of the CGI is brilliant, I was very impressed. They re-did the destruction of Babylon 5 scene from Season 5 finale Sleeping In Light and it is breathtaking, the detail of the Station and the ships throughout Voices In The Dark are outstanding.

The movie starts off with a voice over from Andreas Katsulas, actually its a piece of dialogue from a Season 5 Episode and it is very moving, it is well placed and dramatic, a fitting opening. Then there is a montage of the Babylon 5 characters. I will not go into further detail of the story because I do not want to ruin it for the first time viewing experiance.

I have rated this DVD 4 stars for One reason only. The length of the feature, not including the opening montage and the end credits the story only lasts for 1hr and 10mins. It could have been fleshed out a bit more in length.

An excellent purchase for any fan and a great introduction for a new viewer. J.Michael Stracynski you have done this Babylon 5 fan proud, I look forward to future DVD releases.

Thank you.",1185235200,47,2060,4.2025316455696204
2823362,5,B000PHX8RA,"I am glad to see that B5 is coming back.  It's my favorite TV series.  I hope they don't use slutty Lochley too much, give me Sheridan, Sinclair, Ivanova and the rest.  Sheridan looks great as always, on the cover art and I expect he'll be solid.  I wish they'd done this while Some of the actors who have passed away were still around.",1185148800,4,336,4.203125
2823363,4,B000PHX8RA,"After many false starts such as the Legend of the Rangers and the planned movie, The Memory of Shadows, it is nice to see that series creator JMS has finally been able to get Babylon 5 back. The DVD is the first of a planned 6 that will look at select characters from the series that will fill in bits of their story as well as that of the Babylon 5 universe as a whole.
  The new information that is given is often subtle while some of it is very upfront. One such instance is when a Centauri Prince who is 3rd in line to the throne brings up the subject of Vir. In a somewhat offhand manner, the character mentions that rumor has it that Vir killed his father. Fans of the series will be able to conclude that the character is the child of the Manical Catragia, and that when a dire warning is given about his role in the future, you have a nice framework for possible futuire events.
  Divided into two stories, the first is a interesting spiritual based story, while the second is more of the thriller variety.
The FX have improved and the station has never looked better. My biggest concern with the film, was that there was a severe lack of any real action. While I know the series did not always have to rely on violence, a bit of a extended fight sequence would have been nice after so many years away from new material.
  Boxleitner is solid as always as President John Sheridan, and the supporting cast of Woodward, and Scoggins, round out what is an enjoyable return to the beloved Sci Fi Epic.",1184889600,73,1505,4.30035335689046
2823364,5,B000PHX8RA,"For years fans of Babylon 5 have longed for more of their favorite Sci-fi television series, and now that longing is finally being met. Yet, in the midst of this joyous announcement there are skeptics and critics who have attacked this yet-to-be-released DVD based on its length, price, and currently unknown plot. In response, I would like to make this suggestion: If you are a fan of Babylon 5 - buy this DVD. This DVD is monumentally important to the future of Babylon 5, and by purchasing it you are voting for more Babylon 5 DVDs. JMS has stated that he has story ideas for future B5 Lost Tales installments involving Garibaldi, Londo Mollari, and the Telepath War. But if this DVD does not sell well, Warner Brothers will not finance any future installments; therefore, these stories will never be told and Babylon 5 will be dead. Warner Brothers Executives only speak one language - money. They don't care about online petitions, forums, or blogs; they care about money. Thus, the best thing we fans can do is put our money where our mouth is and buy this DVD. If sales are high, it's possible Warner Bros will give JMS more money for future installments or B5 Lost Tales could even be picked up as a TV series. High DVD sales could open up many possibilities for the future of Babylon 5. Just look at what high DVD sales did for Family Guy and Firefly: The Series. I have already cast my vote for more Babylon 5 by pre-ordering the DVD and so should you!",1184544000,19,1462,4.520754716981132
