2498973,4,B000E6EGK0,Not as great as season 1. Don't be fooled by bad reviews on tho site- some idiots thought they were buying the Jeff bridges series from like a decade later. Not finklemans fault...,1415145600,2,180,4.484848484848484
2498974,1,B000E6EGK0,Very misleading. I was looking for the Jeff Daniels series.,1413849600,5,59,5.0
2498975,1,B000E6EGK0,This was awful. I thought I was ordering The Newsroom with Jeff Daniels. This series is juvenile and stupid.,1405555200,6,108,4.7368421052631575
2498976,1,B000E6EGK0,"I thought I bought Season II of the Jeff Daniels series. This is production distressingly bad and unwatchable. I will not resell my product as I it would be a unfair to any prospective buyer. I would burn it, but why waste a match?",1403308800,8,231,4.2727272727272725
2498977,5,B000E6EGK0,"Ken Finkleman's Newsroom, all three seasons and the film, is the bee's knees.  Season one is the must-have, and it's a knockout, but all three plus the film are outstanding.  This is television's equivalent of the late Henry James novels, but funny.  And Finkleman managed to pull off the rarest feat in any of the moving media -- satire plus farce.  It's just brilliant and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1390521600,,411,4.746478873239437
2498978,1,B000E6EGK0,Miss leading product not the true Newsroom product from HBO ... it was disappointing and not one of my best investnents,1387497600,5,119,4.714285714285714
2498979,1,B000E6EGK0,"This DvD turned out to be not the Season Two of the recent Newsroom written by Aaron Sorkin, but a load of rubbish directed by Ken Finkleman. Needless to say, I can only blame myself for ordering Season Two (and three) without checking thoroughly the writer(s) involved. However, I believe that I was mis-sold this junk and will never allow myself to be fooled again.",1383955200,8,367,4.661538461538462
2498980,5,B000E6EGK0,Easily one of the great shows of the decade. It and larry Sanders were the big picks for me of satire at its best on TV. Finkleman deserves more accolades...few people seem to know him outside those in the know. Huge fan.,1358553600,2,221,4.285714285714286
2498981,4,B000E6EGK0,"The character of George Findlay really should have been played by a horse.
With him, the suspense is not, as it was once said of a character on another newsroom type show altogether, how he was going to get his other foot into his mouth, but rather how in the world he was going to extract any of his feet, frequnently more rhan two of them at the same time, from it.
Or maybe an octupus, except they don't actually have feet.
Would actually have preferred to give this one 4.75 stars.
Am just not that much into cartoon allegories, even as well done as the final episode ""Learning to Fly""",1214956800,2,589,4.315315315315315
8106329,4,B000E6EGK0,What can I say? Part of the collection. Some better than other episodes.,1492992000,,72,4.615384615384615
8106330,5,B000E6EGK0,"Great, too bad no more seasons.",1477612800,,31,4.333333333333333
8106331,1,B000E6EGK0,"The Third Season was NOT a continuation of the first two,,, and it wasn't even worth 2 cents either!",1463702400,2,100,4.315789473684211
8106332,5,B000E6EGK0,One of the best written shows we have seen in a long time.,1456876800,,58,3.5384615384615383
8106333,5,B000E6EGK0,Fabulous series --- too bad it was only on for three seasons.,1447804800,,61,4.166666666666667
8106334,1,B000E6EGK0,I ordered this dvd set thinking it was the HBO 3rd season of the newsroom but it is something else I have never heard of before. What can you do about this. Mike,1445558400,,161,3.909090909090909
8106335,3,B000E6EGK0,I did not order the correct video.  This was not the season 3 I wanted.  The one I was watching was with Jeff Daniels.,1442793600,3,118,3.875
8106336,2,B000E6EGK0,Poor effort at Sienfield spinoff.,1442188800,,33,5.8
8106337,5,B000E6EGK0,"How F......g dumb do you have to be to mistake the best Canadian television series of all time with Aaron Sorkin's middle of the road blunder.
Just saying.
Still if you enjoy your comedy blindly black and without melodramatic sidesteps then there is no greater installment then this collection of maple leaf fashioned irrationality to feast upon.
All three seasons will go.",1435449600,,373,5.032258064516129
8106338,1,B000E6EGK0,"selected the wrong Newsroom, wanted the series on HBO.",1420243200,,54,5.111111111111111
