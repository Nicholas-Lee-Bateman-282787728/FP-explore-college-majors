8268947,5,B00189VNTO,"Paquito de Rivera is one of the best musicians ever to come out of Cuba. Although Arturo Sandoval is consider to be one of the best trumpet players in the world, Paquito is a more complete musician than Arturo.
I mention Arturo because they played together for years in Cuba's best group of all time led by Chucho Valdes, IRAKERE.
Highly recommended.",1335657600,,350,4.661290322580645
8268948,5,B00189VNTO,"Reed master Paquito is at the center of an extraordinairy musical meeting.
The WDR big band & Rundfunk orchestra (it reminds me of the Metropole orchestra) fill the center of a German church that is beatifully lighted out to create the atmosphere of a nightclub. The solo&iacute;st are bright and close by; you can see everything they are doin, almost read the score over their back.
The fine musicians of the WDR big band & Rundfunk orchestra are featured in solo's e.g.: a mash up between the drummer and the percussionist.
Also the vocaliste extraordinaire Fay Claassen gets down & dirty in a show off with Paquito, all in good fun of course.
There are 5 musical pieces on this dvd, that are being seperated by small interviews. The interviews are entertaining especially the one with Paquito.
This production has crisp clear images and a very good sound.
This dvd is highly recommended.",1292716800,,890,4.823529411764706
