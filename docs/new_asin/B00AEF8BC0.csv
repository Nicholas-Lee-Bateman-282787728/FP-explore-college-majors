5410381,5,B00AEF8BC0,"I bought this video along with several others recommended in ""Fitness"" magazine because I was looking to shake up my exercise routines - I'm easily bored and my combinations of Barre Method, treadmill intervals, spinning, and a rowing machine were beginning to get old.  Of all of the new videos I bought, this is my favorite.  It's long - an hour and a half - but it's challenging and a true full-body workout - cardio and toning.  I've been doing it every few days when I have a bit more time and interspersing my other options in between, depending on how much time I have available.  I can really see and feel the difference it's made in my muscle tone and endurance.  It's definitely pushed me - I can't recommend it highly enough.",1360627200,6,736,4.503759398496241
5410382,5,B00AEF8BC0,"This workout is awesome!  I love kickboxing workouts, but this is the best one I've done so far.  The entire workout is a little long, but I try to make time because it is a fun calorie burner.  It's nice that it is broken up into several different segments so if I am short on time, i can just do a couple of them.  Jeanette is motivating and the moves never get boring.  So glad I bought this workout!",1359676800,13,403,4.050632911392405
5410383,4,B00AEF8BC0,"I liked this DVD. It was like a mix between Jillian Michaels Fastfix and Bill Banks Tae Bo. It was nonstop movement and definitely tires you out. If I had to order the three DVDs from most liked to least liked it would be: Jillian Michaels, Jeanette Jenkins, then Billy Banks. Jillian Michaels teaches you particular kickboxing movements and does combinations which I like. She also has a bigger variety of kicks and punches. Hers is more realistic boxing. Jeanette Jenkins DVD is more about getting you to sweat which she does successfully. I just wish it had a little bit more variety when it came to the kickboxing portion and was a more realistic kickboxing. I still think this is an excellent DVD and would suggest it to anybody that wants to work up a sweat.",1357430400,24,764,4.583941605839416
5410384,5,B00AEF8BC0,"Just sweated through this new kickboxing workout and I loved it.  I'm a 55 year old female and consider myself an intermediate exerciser.  This workout gives you a great total body workout.  Jeannette combines cardio, weights, and toning.  The workout is fun, challenging and never boring.  I have to be careful not to harm my knees and the exercises were easy to modify to prevent any injury. I enjoy kickboxing and tae bo and this will definitely go into my weekly rotation.  I find it a challenge to find exercise videos that provide a good, effective workout without going over the top with crazy hard to do moves. Jeannette please continue to produce videos that us baby boomers can do.",1355011200,29,691,4.716666666666667
5410385,5,B00AEF8BC0,"Thank you Jeanette for producing another challenging, fun and effective workout! I love that you combined favorite moves from previous DVD's but also added new, unique moves! I could feel my body toning all over. Anyone who loves the energy of kickboxing will love it from beginning to end. It's a challenge, but it's worth it, and fun :)",1354492800,9,338,4.745762711864407
5410386,5,B00AEF8BC0,"Jeanette Jenkins is the best , this dvd will work you",1455321600,,53,3.909090909090909
5410387,4,B00AEF8BC0,"Just purchased this and did the workout for the first time this morning.  Really enjoyed it!  I also own a bunch of Taebo workouts and while some reviewers felt that this was like Tae bo, I felt as though Jeanette incorporated different combos than Billy.  I didn't have time to do the Ring/Mat with the weights section yet, but did the full cardio and the Abs section.  Wow!  I was sweating from head to toe!  This definitely isn't a workout for beginners, although you could work up to it if you modify some of the moves.  The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because the music was just awful, even cheesy.  However, there is an option to mute the music so you can play your own and still hear Jeanette instructing.  I will definitely use that option.  I will definitely be putting this into my DVD rotation.",1454025600,2,822,4.42
5410388,4,B00AEF8BC0,"Awhile back, I decided I needed to mix up my exercise routine, to add some life to it by getting some different DVDs (in many cases, with instructors whose work I wasn't familiar with).  I have always liked martial arts and kickboxing based workouts, and I wanted something with a long period of cardio in it (more than 30 minutes and preferably more than 45) so this appealed to me.

I'm happy with the workout although I acknowledge it isn't really new.  If you have done the older Tae Bo videos, there aren't a lot of new moves here, and some of the combinations are even pretty similar.  However, the participants in the background are not as confused as in some Tae Bo videos and reps of each combination are closer to being even on each side (though they may not be identical, you never do 8 reps on one side and 40 on the other).

The set is clean and open and not distracting.  The music is OK but nothing special.  It sounds like it was computer generated and is on some kind of loop, but the pace is good for the moves you are doing, and it's not annoying.  Plus, you can hear the instructor over it just fine.  There are two demonstrators besides the instructor and they both look like they know exactly what they are doing, plus they can keep up.

The cardio section, with warm-up, is about 50 minutes long and is divided into sections (in one, you work more on punches, in another you do more side kicks, etc.).  I just do them all in a row.  I would classify this as high impact, most definitely.  You can modify somewhat by not jumping (for example, just doing regular kicks near the end of the cardio instead of jump kicks), although not a ton of modifications are offered.

I'll be honest -- I skip the strength training section.  I have done a few rounds of P90X and P90X3 and lifting 3 or 5 pound weights doesn't do much for me because of that.  But, there are some lower body moves and some twists on upper body moves I haven't seen before, and if you are new to strength training, it's a good introduction.

The hostess is friendly and easy to understand.  Cueing is good and the choreography is easy to follow.  I am not the most coordinated person but I was able to keep up easily.  (You generally do a combination slowly a few times before getting up to tempo.)  The hostess does tend to laugh at her own jokes on occasion, but it's really not too bad.

Anyway, overall I was quite happy with this.  If you don't mind the similarity to Tae Bo (it *is* possible to have a martial arts workout that is different from Tae Bo, for example, Les Mills Combat is quite different), it definitely is a good cardio workout.  I will be on the lookout for more DVDs from the same instructor.",1452556800,10,2703,4.328031809145129

5410393,3,B00AEF8BC0,Nothing special. I was looking for something a little different from the Taebo DVDs I have but it turns out it's pretty much the same. The instructor did little to motivate or inspire me. This will probably collect dust on a shelf somewhere,1437696000,,240,4.604651162790698

5410397,5,B00AEF8BC0,"This is an ass kicking workout for sure! I have another video featuring Jeanette Jenkins and I really enjoy it so I thought I would try this out. I love that you can select different workout sections based on the time you have available, I just wish it had a matrix option so I could select them all at the beginning and have them play in that order. I love that Tanja Djelevic is one of her helpers (or whatever you call the workout video equivalent of back up dancer :o)  ). I love Jeanette and I promise you will enjoy this dvd, it is an amazing workout!",1433462400,,557,4.157407407407407
5410398,5,B00AEF8BC0,Such a great workout! You can do as much or as little as you want. The main cardio workout is about 50 minutes long which is a great workout. I even convinced my 57 year old mother to do it with me and she liked it so much I just ordered her one! You can make it as challenging or easy as you want by choosing who to follow on the DVD as well as how long you do the workout for. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an awesome cardio workout.,1432425600,,457,3.7708333333333335

It did not bring my heart rate beat faster like any other cardio workouts but I know I've burn at least 1000 calories. What I'm doing right now is I combined 2 workouts that is JillIan Michaels 1 week shred witch is strength training and followed by Jeanette Jenkins cardio kickboxing workouts. With that I burned 1350 calories. I like coach Jeanette workout....its fun & u can feel burn every part of body expecially you legs.",1399852800,2,545,4.808510638297872
5410402,5,B00AEF8BC0,"Wanna sweat? this is your video. I just got my booty kicked and am still dripping sweat. I like that the majority of her moves are not too complicated. There are a few in there that I could not do due to my lack of coordination but I could follow about 98% of the moves.  I like a few things about this video: 1) that you can listen w or w/o music 2) that you can watch it all the way through or pick segments to do. I like the segment option for days I have less than 90 minutes to work out. This is a great addition to Jillian Micheals, Jackie Warner and Barre workout routines. I really feel that by adding this to my rotation of about 9 videos (from various trainers) I have a good range of options and variety to have great workouts w/o gym costs. I admit that I could not keep tempo w/ her all the time but I was still able to do about 12 to her 16reps. GOOD STUFF.  Calorie burn summary of approx 505 cal ( I am 5'3/124lbs) and I used Polar FT4 to get these #'s:
Warm up: 40 cal
Power Punch: 55 cal
Sidekick: 100 Cal
Round house: 91 cal
Knock out: 100 cal
Mat: 44 cal
Abs: 75 cal

I use this video on days I don't do HIIT workouts, which help me burn about 650 cal in 75 min, so this video is a bit easier than HIIT but still challenging. By doing this type of video rotation 5-6x a week and keeping my food intake at about 1400, I am losing 1.5lbs per week. Good stuff.",1399507200,8,1377,3.893238434163701

5410408,5,B00AEF8BC0,DVD got here super fast. I did all 90 minutes of it and omg I was sweating like no other. I bought the 30 day shred from Jillian Michaels a while ago but to me it was dull.

I'm barely getting back into exercise after a month off so I was only able to do 30 min of it but was sweating like crazy. I definitely love how dynamic it is and Jeanette really gave my legs and abs a burn. All the reviews were right and it's worth the cash! :)

5410414,4,B00AEF8BC0,"I consider myself at an intermediate to advanced level of fitness.

This was a decent workout but not as tough as some of her others.  If you have done any of her other workouts, you will recognize the same moves.  If you are fine with the old DVDs, you probably would rather skip this.  If you prefer to toss those and get an updated version with better production values, this would be it.",1378684800,4,391,4.315068493150685
5410415,5,B00AEF8BC0,"This video kicked my butt! I have yet to be be able to complete the entire workout.

5410421,5,B00AEF8BC0,I have been a fan of Jeanette's DVD's for several years now.  I was happy to see that she released a new Kickboxing DVD.  I loved the last one but it's always fun to do something new.  I was happy to see that she changed it up enough to be new and challenging while still incorporating some of the original moves from the first one.  This will definitely be a regular on my rotations.,1362960000,,384,4.148648648648648
5410422,5,B00AEF8BC0,"This DVD is hardcore!  I heard alot of Jeanette Jenkins and I wanted to give her a try.  I mostly utilize group exercise classes at my local YMCA but I wanted some options for working out at home.  I tried it for the first time today.  Holy Cow!  It didn't make it through the whole 90 minutes.  I originally thought it was only a 50 minute dvd and didn't realize it was 90 minutes until about 5 minutes before I was supposed to start.  That's ok because I skipped the last 2 segments which made it 50 minutes.
  I like how you can pick what you're going to do to change up your workout.  You can do the whole 90 minutes or you can skip to segments that you want to do.  It's very easy to change it up within this one DVD.  Which is awesome if you get bored with the same thing over and over again.
  Keep in mind this is NOT a dvd for beginners.  I have been working out consistently for years now and I have lost 100lbs over the past few years and I would consider myself an intermediate exerciser.  This DVD is very challenging, you are constantly moving and working up a sweat!
  Jeanette is very motivating and encouraging.  She provides constant instruction throughout the workout which is good because she reminds you to maintain proper form so you don't hurt yourself.
  I really liked this dvd and I'm getting ready to see what other dvds she has available!",1361404800,9,1366,4.2784313725490195

5410424,5,B00AEF8BC0,"This is my 2nd Jeanette Jenkins kickboxing DVD and I'm not disappointed at all. I haven't managed to do the entire workout in one session (it's over an hour long), but according to my heart monitor, I burn anywhere from 300-400 calories in a 30-minute mix up of the segments (way more than I do with any of Jillian Michaels' workouts). The other great thing is that I'm not bored and 30 minutes are up before I know it. (Most DVDs, I'm checking the clock after 6 minutes.). Jeanette is motivating, engaging, and does the entire workout with you (unlike Jillian). If you're in a workout rut, haven't found your ""thing"" yet, or already like kickboxing, I highly recommend.",1361059200,8,670,4.638655462184874

I also own Bikini boot camp 2, I alternate between the two. I feel so accomplished after I'm through. I feel my endorphins pouring down for the remainder of the day. The results are amazing. I can't stop looking at my butt and abs in the mirror. This workout is  for those who are serious about getting results. I'm a firm believer that our spiritual self is supreme however we have a carnal side that must be maintained through certain disciplines. This workout has has been a true blessing for me.

Lots of cardio (not complicated moves at all) but you are able to pick what session you want to do....only con is screen goes black after each section and you have to go the next and start.  This is a intermediate plus workout....beginners may have a hard time just due to the intensity....not the instruction, but just keep at it, and listen to your body and it will get easier as you get more fit!  .
