8157010,1,B000KHXCTY,This so called video is just a collection of video clips set to repetitive music with 2 guys talking all the way through. Don't waste your money. Most of it is filmed in darkness and you can't really see much except blurry lightning shots.,1204675200,3,239,4.454545454545454
8157011,2,B000KHXCTY,"I have loved thunderstorms since childhood.  This DVD could have be five stars, but,really, the thunderstorm is the music.  Adding a music track (and a poor one at that) just completely ruined the DVD for me.  I couldn't even get through the whole DVD.

I would have rated it no stars, but I gave it two in case there's someone out there who isn't offended by the lousy music track.",1193529600,,382,4.414285714285715

All of The Lightning Hunters work is reccomended for any avid weather fiend. A+++++++++",1126828800,,149,4.518518518518518
8157013,4,B000KHXCTY,"Turn down your lights, turn up the volume, sit back and enjoy the spectacular lightning show captured on film/video.
The background music is quite nice and apparently is written and performed by the artist who shot the lightning scenes.  Some of the scenes of the strikes are incredibly close and awesome (obviously a remote camera--too close for a human to be there!).
I highly recommend that you take the opportunity to witness mother nature's force.  The video is not a high-dollar production like Discovery Channel, but a lot of time, thought, and effort are evident in its production.  It's a nice video to own.",982713600,7,616,4.903846153846154
