2411059,5,B000BBOUHM,"Many of these films, some frustratingly short, others too long, have occasionally surfaced on other collections, but to get these rarities from the golden era of jazz all on a pair of DVDs is a rare treat.  It was a bit misleading to call it a 'Ten Pack' as this created an expectation of 10DVDs, but the two that are there are crammed full of rarities and delights that will appeal to most serious jazz buffs.  Forget the corny humour and dialogue in the story movies, it's the rare appearances of jazz greats like Ellington and Calloway, Ammons and Lewis, Lena Horne at her most gorgeous, Joe Turner, Nat Cole and others, that make this such a bargain.  For me the prize was 'Hi-De-Ho', and hour long movie with some sensational Cab Calloway - what a presence he had.  Don't delay, buy this before it disappears again for many years.",1235088000,36,835,4.546666666666667
2411060,3,B000BBOUHM,"The ""Soundies"" offered in JAZZ 10 MOVIE PACK were looped films stored within a rather ingenious pay-per-view video jukebox. These devices were quite popular in the early 40s, and the artists featured (Fats Waller, Louis Jordan and Cab Calloway, among others) made some really fine music for the Soundies folks.

CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK, with Amos & Andy, nominally qualifies as a jazz movie, because the Duke Ellington orchestra performs a couple of songs midway through. The other 7 titles in this collection are legitimate examples of early jazz and swing movies.

2411087,3,B000BBOUHM,Case was damaged on arrival and of the ten movies I could only access nine of them.  Rhythm and Blues Revue featuring Sarah Vaughn would not load on my DVD player....very disappointing.  The other movies and soundies were interesting and watchable.,1396828800,,248,5.024390243902439
2411088,4,B000BBOUHM,these movies take me back a long ways and they are just as good now as they were then. you will enjoy seeing some of the greats from that era in their prime.,1394236800,,157,3.787878787878788
2411089,5,B000BBOUHM,I enjoyed the movie.  A friend of mine who has the movie can now have theirs back. It's a great addition to my collection.,1393200000,,122,4.083333333333333
2411090,1,B000BBOUHM,Disappointed in quality and in the content. I had expected it to be better. I guess it is all that was available.,1389571200,,113,4.181818181818182
2411091,2,B000BBOUHM,"I opened it a few days after receiving it and discovered one of the projects is not on there at all. I'd like to return it for an exchange or a refund. Some of what I saw was pretty good, but ""Rhythm & Blues"" is non-existent. Please advise.",1361145600,,240,4.020833333333333
2411092,3,B000BBOUHM,Nice combo pak esp. if into nostalgic Afrocentric cinema. Not the best cinematography or acting and in some cases plot lines---but a very good buy and bargain and some great old flicks,1359936000,,184,4.78125
2411093,5,B000BBOUHM,"If you like swing, r&b, and big band music from the 40's & 50's, especially as created by black artists, don't wait, get this set.  There is a fantasy short called ""Boogie Woogie Dream"" featuring a magical Lena Horne which, alone, is worth the price of the entire set, she and it are that good.  On 2 discs you get 5 musical films (as opposed to ""musicals""), 3 Revues, and 6 (I think) Soundies.  The films have inconsequential plots and performances but mostly provide a structure to include musical performances of Cab Calloway, Lena Horne, Louis Jordan, and others.  The Cab Calloway film, ""Hi-De-Ho"", is essentially a vehicle to showcase Calloway's nightclub act captured in 1943.  In addition to Calloway's dynamic performances you will see a tap dancing trio that will blow your mind and a female trio doing a gospel tinged number featuring a soloist who sings like an angel.  (Sorry, at this writing I don't recall their names and don't feel like loading the discs and searching them out for this review.)  The ""Rhythm and Blues Revue"" and the ""Rock N' Roll Revue"" are telecasts filmed, I think, at the Apollo Theater and feature captivating performances from the likes of Nat King Cole, Duke Ellington and his big band, Big Joe Turner, Teddy Wilson and Orchestra, Count Basie, and an unbelievable assortment of stars, jaw-dropping dance performances, and some dated but historically interesting comedy.  The Soundies are short films featuring musical performances.  If you're a fan of the performers mentioned above and the kinds of music they made, you'll want this set in your permanent collection.  There's a wealth of material for the price, and it's something you'll return to again and again, especially when the state of modern music makes you depressed and you want to experience what solid musicians used to do.
The transfers are decent, nothing special.  They look probably similar to what they looked like when first presented.  The sound is good, hasn't been boosted in any way that I can tell, but found I could tweak it with my system quite satisfactorily.",1340236800,5,2077,4.919770773638969
2411094,3,B000BBOUHM,"The viewing quality of this DVD is the same excelent VHS; with interlacing lines is visible during movement. Very anoying to be seeing interlacing edges in video's with substancial movement. Interlacing is an artifact of NTSC TV which is something that could be eliminated by producing a new recording of the SOUNDIES.

After watching a disappointingly talked over collection of SOUNDIES produced on DVD by PBS. I've got to say the the PBS guys did a great job with the video quality as their talked over SOUNDIES were the sharpest I've seen and recorded with no interlacing artifact. PBS must have produced new recording; wish those new recordings were available for viewing.",1307404800,7,676,5.035714285714286
2411095,3,B000BBOUHM,"Don't look for video restoration here. Some of these films come from seriously damaged copies, and they look pretty poor. Also, in order to get so much material onto two one-sided discs, a low quality speed has been used, further diminishing the video quality. However, some of this material is worth putting up with a lot to be able to see. My own favorite is the short ""Boogie Woogie Dream,"" in which you get to see Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson, Lena Horne, and Teddy Wilson performing. (Incidentally, the disc labels these collections of shorts as ""Soundies,"" which they are not; they are theatrical shorts.) But every film here has at least something well worth seeing. Just make sure you have your remote on hand to skip the bad stuff.",1244505600,12,739,4.736434108527132
2411096,5,B000BBOUHM,"If this issue was at at full price then it would only be for fanatical lovers of early jazz artists, but at the give-away price asked there is enough good stuff in there to make an outstanding bargain. The quality of the picture varies but the sound is uniformly good and that is what matters with these historic jazz rarities. The acting varies between good and minimal But the musical performances enshrined here are priceless. If only British film makers had rendered us a similar popular music backlog !!

8084621,1,B000BBOUHM,"I bought this for Sara Vaughn.  She is pictured on the cover, but she sings only one single, short, song.  The video is filled with silly comedy and mc comments.  I wouldn't have purchased it had I known.",1467158400,,204,4.315789473684211

8084626,2,B000BBOUHM,This 10 film compilation opens with 'Check and Double Check' with white men playing very degrading and archetypical racist portrayals of Black men. There are some interesting musical acts but the overall depiction of Blacks is immersed in degrading stereotypes.,1430265600,,261,5.55
8084627,5,B000BBOUHM,What a deal:  great music that influenced the 50's and shows the fun times our country used to have,1420588800,,99,4.2105263157894735

8084630,3,B000BBOUHM,"This is fine for a historical perspective but don't expect quality. There re a lot of films here and many are very dated looking and the quality of video and sound are not up to the remastered versions of older films we have come to expect. The music parts are fun, the rest is pretty much a fast forward.",1397174400,,305,4.186440677966102
