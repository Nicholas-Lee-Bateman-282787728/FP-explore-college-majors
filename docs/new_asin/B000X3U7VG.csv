8226885,4,B000X3U7VG,"Kodomo no Jikan is...strange. In one respect it is typical loli fair; loli, for those who don't know, essentially being underage anime girls doing either cute things, or in this case most of the time, sexual things. If you hear someone be referred to or refer to themselves as a lolicon, it means they get off on underage anime girls. And for those lolicons reading this review, I can assure you you'll more than likely love this anime.

Back to the topic at hand. Kodomo no Jikan is loli fair that comes across as rather funny because of how insane the main character, Rin Kokonoe, is. She falls in love with her new teacher, Mr. Aoki, and pretty much sexually exploits herself to him at any given opportunity. Through twelve episodes we see three different types of moods. Serious, loli, and cute. The loli can come across as funny though. That's the only reason I wasn't one hundred percent creeped out by this show. That, and a chick created it.

And on a totally unrelated note I watched the subbed version and noticed it was done by Loli subs. Okay, that's rather expected...oh, Suck-Suck Subs also helped. That's not disturbing.

The story revolves around new teacher Mr. Aoki. He's twenty-three, single, and apparently one sexy mama...or papa. One of the students, Rin Kokonoe falls in love with her new sensei and is suddenly taking every opportunity she can to have intercourse with him. I swear to god, I am not kidding when I tell you that this third grader tries to give him BJ's in this show. Her best friend is a rich bitchy goth-ish girl with an outfit for every fetish. She's also a lesbian who really loves Kokonoe and wishes she were a guy. Add to that the third friend, a girl with glasses who is apparently hitting puberty at age ten and is shy about everything, and we have ourselves a crazy love story. As the series progresses we learn why Kokonoe is the way she is and we see a lot more of a serious plot appear beneath the gratuitous (but funny) loli. This plot isn't really thick and is actually rather basic when you get right down to it, but it works. We feel a lot more for the characters toward the very end.

The romance may be unorthodox but comes across as cute as it is the girl who wants it. Mr. Aoki is a weird character. I don't think he wants a romance with her, but he sees himself more as a father figure to her. Though at the end of the series (SPOILER) I get the feeling that his words to her meant that he would always be by her side and she would wait until she was old enough to finally get with him. It's actually rather cute. The series has a way of making something as disturbing as loli and making it kind of cute, which scares the shit out of me. I shouldn't like this. I shouldn't. But I do.

The animation is alright. Characters look good (NOT LIKE THAT!) but are not amazing in the grand scheme of things. Animation is smooth and emotion is conveyed well through character expression. Backgrounds look good. Not much to say in this area.

The characters of the series are all rather basic and flat except for Rin Kokonoe. She is the standout character, not because of her continual panty shots and lolicon masturbation material, but because she's rather more complex than the rest of the characters. She does the things she does for a reason that is explained later and it's a good enough reason. I can see my younger self in her position to a lesser extent. The relationship between Aoki-sensei and her is really even more complex than those in most romance anime. There is a lot going on, Aoki doesn't understand Rin at all, Rin really loves sensei. Aoki slowly begins to understand and wants to help and Rin just wishes she were older as she realizes all she is is a child. At the same time, Aoki realizes he's an adult and has more responsibility than ever before. So we see the two extremes, one a child who wants to be an adult; one an adult who more than likely wishes he were a child once again. It's effective. The relationship is actually quite effective and while it is taken to extremes that make me uncomfortable (on Kokonoe's part, Aoki never does anything) it is a very cute relationship.

The two friends are different. The shy friend is typical, quiet, and boring. The only reason she was any good was she saw Aoki sensei naked when the girls sneaked into the hot spring and it started a string of jokes about his wing-wang-diddily-dang. The other friend who I can only assume was created for every loli fetishist ever, is funny as well, calling Aoki virgin at every opportunity, but I still didn't like her. She was just too flat for me.

All the teacher characters, especially the teacher who falls for Mr. Aoki, are all flat as well. None of them have any development and I just didn't care about what they had to say in the teacher's lounge.

The music is good. The opening isn't bad, nor is the ending. The music during the show is good. All the voice actors are good and convey emotion well. Sound effects are fine. Blah, blah, blah.

So you've made it through my review and you're probably scratching your head and wondering: ""Hey Sean, what the hell?"" Well, I asked myself the same thing for the past three days I've watched this. While one half of my head is actually rather surprised at how cute the show was, the other half is spinning with the pure insanity of how nasty it was. It was downright uncomfortable to watch a lot of the time. I mean, it was funny, but I still felt wrong watching it. Which I shouldn't feel when watching an anime. There was probably a better way to convey the story than through all the sex jokes and insanity, but I guess it was built to appeal to loli enthusiasts and those who aren't alike. It's like being on a wall where one side is loli and the other is cute romance and the show sways toward either side but stays balanced on top of the wall.

I shouldn't like this. I should hate this. I should be sitting down and giving this show an angry review. But I actually thought it was good. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad. It conveyed a story, used an extreme to convey it better, and came across as partly cute, partly disgusting. How can something do that, I don't know!

Let me end this before my brain oozes from my ears. Kodomo no Jikan is a 7/10.",1372204800,14,6266,4.406222990492654
