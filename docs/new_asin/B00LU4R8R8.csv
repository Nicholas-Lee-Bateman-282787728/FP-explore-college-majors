8668166,4,B00LU4R8R8,"This is one of the more comprehensive videos of high end (but not choreographed professional) Salon tango. If you're a tango student this is a great way to see what real people that have spent a whole lot of time practicing, do on dance floor. This isn't stage tango, this is a style you could use during a real dance if you've got a bit of room to work. The competitors in this video didn't know what music they will be dancing to until it's announced a moment before the dance starts, where many of the videos you watch on YouTube are professionals dancing to a piece of music they selected and have well rehearsed.
The production quality is better than most tango videos, I'll give it that much. One could get picky and rag on the color balance and framing, but this isn't that kind of video. Think of it as archival footage. It appears to have been shot from a tripod with a bit of pan and zoom.",1482710400,,899,4.294117647058823

awful. The music, the location, the competition. How dare you charge such a fee for something
I could have filmed myself!",1415059200,,215,5.0
