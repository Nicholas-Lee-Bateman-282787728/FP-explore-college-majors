2654226,4,B000IB0DD0,I really enjoyed this series.  It is well made and informative.  Would make a great gift.,1191024000,4,89,4.5
2654227,4,B000IB0DD0,"Of course it's an overview and some issues are too briefly treated.  My only real problem is the standard glossing over of the reason for Paul Revere's ride and the cause for the Battles of Lexington and Concord.  You don't send that many elite troops, the Light and Grenadier companies, nearly 20 miles into the countryside on foot in the 18th century to capture a few key rebel leaders:  you send your dragoons.

The main goal of the march was the seizure of the miltia's powder stores and one small 3 pounder cannon held in common at Concord.  Most of the colonists had some powder in hand but probably only enough for about 20-25 shots. As the colonies lacked any significant domestic gunpowder production, the real prize of the march was that gunpowder in Concord . With it's seizure, the rebels would soon have only clubbed muskets for fighting. A strategy whose wisdom and success could be seen two months later when at Bunker Hill the rebels held against the British but were finally overrun with the bayonet after they ran out of powder. And when Knox arrived with the cannon from Ticonderoga, Washington still did not have enough powder to serve the guns, thus he bluffed the British out of Boston with cannon he could not fire in March of 1776.

More than coincidentally the Colonial Governor of Virginia, Lord Dunsmore, seized Virginia's common powder stores at Williamsburg Magazine on April 21st 1775, exactly two days after the assault on Concord: indicating a probable Crown strategy to execute two nearly simultaneous and identical actions and disarm two of the more problematic colonies.

So the actual final triggering of armed conflict in the Revolution was not the Stamp Act, Tea Act, or the Intolerable Acts but was a British attempt at gun control! But I imagine due to the sensitive nature of that controversial issue it's just too much to expect anyone to actually acknowledge it in even such an excellent documentary as this.

In any event, this set is well worth the money.",1183766400,18,2000,4.7936046511627906
2654228,5,B000IB0DD0,"I've watched countless documentaries about The Revolutionary War and this is one of, if not the best I've seen. It is a comphrehensive look at the war, its causes, battles and political struggles starting with the Stamp Act in 1765 and ending with Washington taking the oath of office in 1789 as the first President. Historian and Author comments provide insight and facts that help put the viewer in the mind set and feel of this conflict. Some history buffs will notice inaccuracies in uniforms and weapons but it does not take away from the overall quality of information presented. I highly recommended this DVD set.",1183680000,63,620,4.8584905660377355
2654229,5,B000IB0DD0,"I particularly liked the emphasis on the political aspects of the Revolution, in addition to the military.  And the series focused on events often left out or shortened in documentaries, such as the southern battles.  I would encourage history teachers to use this series in their classrooms.

The last two segments might have been skipped, since they didn't offer any new information.  But they provided a recap of the series.",1183593600,13,427,5.057142857142857
2654230,4,B000IB0DD0,"A great examination of the American Revolutionary War by the History Channel.  Includes interviews with historians, battlefield maps and examinations of troop movements, letters from the battlefields, and actor portrayals of battles and historical figures.

The Revolution starts out with the examinations of the cause of the revolution, such as colonial resentment of taxes levied after the Seven Years' War without any representation.  It follows this through the forging of the Declaration of Independence and the battles of the Revolutionary War.  It finishes up with the problems facing the nation after the war.

I don't think I had a good enough realization in school with how hard times were for these soldiers as they waged war.  This video goes into detail with the troubled supply lines that plagued Washington's army, the heavy desertion and mutiny (which Washington clamped down on with some extraordinary tactics), and the many failed battles that occured in the first few years of the Revolutionary War.  It covers internal conflicts between such characters as Horatio Gates and George Washington.

Also discussed are Benjamin Franklin's efforts in France to recruit the French navy and John Paul Jone's foray into Britain and Ireland.

The first half of the series covers the battles in the north and the remaining few episodes discuss how the battles move south into Savannah, the back woods of the Carolinas, and finally Yorktown.

One problem with the series is that they tend to recycle the interviews and footage throughout.

US history books tend to lionize the founding fathers, but this series (and books such as the Founding Brothers) show how none of these people was perfect, and shows their faults as well as their strengths.  I came away with this series (which I downloaded from iTunes, BTW) with a much better understanding of the Revolutionary War.",1170547200,146,1880,5.188741721854305
2654231,3,B000IB0DD0,"I was excited to order this 13 part series after catching part of it on the History Channel.  Upon receiving it however and watching the 1st installment, my personal opinion is that the video quality and DVD production is very poor.  I don't understand why they would shoot this is widescreen but show it in a funky letterbox type aspect. There are white dotted lines across the top of the screen that are very distracting. For those of you who understand video, I would rate this about the quality of a VCD. The sound is okay.  While I would have given this series 5 stars, the poor quality of the DVD brings the purchase down to a 3 for me.  Note to History Channel:  Upgrade your technology.",1167696000,46,694,4.433070866141732
2654232,5,B000IB0DD0,"I will be purchasing this collection soon after it is released. A great, definitive series. beautifully shot. Up to the usual high standards of the History Channel. The guy who played Ben Franklin was a dead ringer for him!",1162166400,5,223,4.743589743589744
2654233,4,B000IB0DD0,"The DVDs arrived timely, and my family found the documentary very interesting.  However, there is a lot of repetition that could be left out and story shortened somewhat.  The series is also a little pricey.",1425600000,,207,4.885714285714286

I know everything cannot be included, but I had hoped to learn more about the enlistment on the ""Over the Mountain Men"" from what is now Tennessee to fight General Cornwallis'es army in western North Carolina.  The depictions were creditable and the story never dragged or bogged down.  I recommend it.",1411257600,,364,4.918032786885246

2654244,5,B000IB0DD0,"I give this doc a big two thumbs up. Not only was it a good learning tool but help me see my heroes Nathanael Greene and Jefferson in a whole and better light. John Adams had guts for sticking up for the loyalists you have to give him his dues for that, which is why he made such a great president. Too bad we don't have men like them any more. But we have so many cities, bridges, and even museums named after these fine gentleman and ""Patriots"". I have this at home and love it. It's one of my all time favorite documentaries! But then again I love learning about the Revolution. I do not find this bias as it tells many sides to the story as what we looked like to other races (Native Americans and African-Americans) and other countries The British and The French. I give Franklin props too man it wasn't easy leaving England because of the conflict nor was it easy to convince the French that the colonists had a shot at winning. America came through though and that is why we are not apart of Britain anymore. Be happy that these men spilled their blood so that we could have freedom of speech, religion, and the press. I think people need to stop worrying how the story is told whether it is told Pro American or told many different ways. The point is we are free! I wished that the founding father's however had dealt with Slavery but I was not alive then to give them the hint. And they saved it for a different war........ Basically I am proud to be American free to think, and be who I want to be. Aside from the founding father's lets remember the men who fought and died during this war, not a lot are mentioned because they were an army of regular men. Men who were not soldiers who had no combat experience what so ever. They went out and trained to become one of the best armies in the world. Be proud and stop letting the small stuff get to you. There is no bias here. There is no ""agenda"" it's a story of actual facts! How that is bias, untrue, or has an agenda is beyond me. Just relish in the fact that you are free, they weren't god given rights they were rights given to us by god fearing men who knew how to be free and recognize that they couldn't be enslaved by anyone least of all a king.",1404864000,,2214,4.175233644859813

2654247,1,B000IB0DD0,"This documentary is extremely biased against the American Revolution and the American Patriots.  In disc 1 the narrator says that the revolution spread like an Epidemic, this is characteristic of the negative light in which the Patriots who founded this country are portrayed by this video.

2654251,4,B000IB0DD0,This film is excellent in many ways. The actors and narration bring much of the history of the Revolution to life. The one thing that isn't included that I'd like to have known more about was the life of the people who weren't involved in the politics of the war.,1373414400,,263,4.28
2654252,5,B000IB0DD0,"This box set is by far the best historical account I have come across so far. I would have loved this box set more if there were more battles of the Revolution shown and historically explained,in other words if this had 10 DVD'S instead of 5. It would have given a much more in depth understanding of what we were fighting the British for ,which were much more than Independence.by seeing and hearing from the narrator battle by battle we would understand and be amazed as to how far our will to fight the British was.",1371168000,,518,4.40625

2654254,5,B000IB0DD0,"Easy to watch, easy to follow, well researched.  This is a brilliant documentary with narrative, actors, and documentations.  Extraordinary!  I learned so much about how the United States came to be.  And, not just facts...a real story with people who come to life.  Kudos to the History Channel!",1341532800,,296,5.083333333333333
2654255,3,B000IB0DD0,"Despite being thirteen 50 min. or so episodes long this History channel opus falls short.  Concentrating as it seems to do on the military aspects of the war, there are surprising omissions.  Arnold is given a lot of attention, yet his entire campaign in Cannda is completely ignored!  In fact the entire 1775 Rebel Invasion of Canada which came close to succeeding is not once mentioned here.  Fortunately the fledgling United States failed to secure British North America, but to omit this entire aspect of the war seems unfortunate.  Benedict Arnold played a major part in this campaign, and there were several famous actions that should be chronicled here.

Another serious omission are both the battles of Assunpink Creek (aka 2nd Battle of Trenton) and Princeton.  Trenton gets most of the credit here while neither of these actions that came a few weeks later hardly get any mention.  They formed an important part of Washy's Winter Campaign of 1776-77.

The battles around New York were also glossed over with a general look at Long Island and virtually nothing else about Harlem Heights and White Plains.  Even Nathan Hale, the alleged Spy and Arsonist of New York was ignored.  This I found surprising considering how famous his speech on the gallows was.  ""I regret that I only have one life to give for my country, etc, etc"".

The Saratoga Campaign gets brief mention as well with important details left out.  The 1777 campaign around Philadelphia shows Brandywine Creek but neglects to mention Germantown fought just a few weeks later.  It was this battle as well as the success at Saratoga that decided France's declaration for the Revolution.

While all of these may be considered somewhat minor omissions they do add up.  For a series of such length they should have been included.  The last two episodes which dwell on Washy's life basically repeat material seen throughout the whole series already.  This wasted time might have been better spent providing fuller coverage of the entire conflict.

There are some good episodes buried in the mass of the whole.  In particular the siege of Charleston was well done.  Others have good aspects at times.

Some of the talking heads used throughout the series were light on their knowledge of the period.  There were only a few historians with published works used here.  The re-enactor footage is repeated a lot.  Some of it does not match up well.  The Bunker Hill scenes hardly matched the battle.  In some cases its almost better to use historical prints and paintings if the Living History scenes are limited.  This is a production choice of course.

As with most History Channel Productions there tends to be a lot of repeat material as these are designed for commercial TV.  The same scenes and music are often re-used at various times throughout the series.  There is a tongue and cheek aspect to the narration that gets annoying at times.

While the production quality is over all quite good, I was disappointed with some of the decisions made to portray the better known aspects of the War.  These have all been well covered before with earlier series.  There was a chance here to provide a really comprehensive view of the Rev War period.  Unfortunately the producers opted for the more standard approach with a few clever gimmicks. For a series of such length the History Channel's THE REVOLUTION falls short in a number of critical areas.  Its still a good, standard view of the History, but the true Rev War buff will find much that is disappointing.  Worthwhile for another general look at the History of this compelling period, but not as complete as it should have been.",1332806400,7,3648,4.8525121555915725
2654256,3,B000IB0DD0,"The second DVD contains review of the first DVD and each subsequent DVD contains expanded review of prior DVDs.  The whole program should have been condensed to 2 DVDs.

2654257,4,B000IB0DD0,"I enjoyed viewing this series. I have seen another similar series which I enjoyed (I think it was produced by the History Channel, but I can't remember), and I found this series to be comparable. Some of the dramatizations seem a little overused, but overall this series is well produced, well written, and both entertaining and informative. I would buy this again knowing what I do, and I would recommend this to someone interested in getting a basic overview of the American Revolution without having to comb through a series of history books.",1327968000,,545,4.870967741935484
2654258,1,B000IB0DD0,"From making the British look like, oh they were just trying to get along with the colony or the rabble as this portrays them, to Washington being an insincere, no, a lying plotter for power, to making the continental army into a bigoted all white military force, Black and whites served side by side (blacks received pensions after the war) with writings from Washington out of context to disparage him, that he may have started the french Indian war please. This is such a twisted, liberal rewriting of history. If you want to know History read their own words. Read Washington, Jefferson, Franklin. I watched 3 parts, before I had to give up.

2654259,5,B000IB0DD0,"I have watched these DVD's several times and each time I sit in awe and wonder for the sacrifices made by the first Americans and the founding Fathers, especially George Washington, for the independence of our country from England.
I look at the USA today, and wonder how many would be willing to give up all they did for our country.  All the lives lost in the Continental Army, the struggles, the battles lost and won, the hardships they faced, are unbelievable, as we have so much today.  Our problems today, are so few, compared to what they faced.
These are beautiful DVD's and so realistic.  I just live out the scenes with the actors, as the Revolution of our country is certainly on display in the scenes of the well produced movie.
I think every American needs to see these DVD's so they will have such an insight into the sacrifices that were made for the country we have today.
All I say, they is awesome, fantastic!

2654260,4,B000IB0DD0,"I must say that I was impressed with the overall view of the video. There are some flaws to this Documentary, but they give an extensive details that can be beneficial to a newcomer to this subject.

The first things that I was glad about was they mentioned the Southern portion of the War. Usually, very little of the Revolutionary War is mentioned below Virginia, if at all, and I appreciate the detail they give towards it. Also, it does give detail of Benedict Arnold's heroics before his treacherous deal with the British, and may portray a different perspective for some. Also the mention of France, prior towards Yorktown, and that they address some of the myths of the war, such as Valley Forge being the worst winter, when it was Morristown that was worse.

Now the issues. The problem that I have with these documentaries that involve reanactments is that you start to see the same scenes again over a course of a video. Such as George Washington swiping papers and other material off the table, Benedict Arnold pointing giving orders during Saratoga, the same group of soldiers digging ditches and trenches over again, Same scene with Benjamin Franklin riding in a carriage in France, just to mention a few. The lack of detail of the Dawes and the other riders is also something I noticed. Or the lack of mention Marquis de Lafayette at all. How do you have over 10 hours of documentary and miss some of these details? And these are just the ones I've noticed. The overview of George Washington on his way to his inaguration was also unnecessary. They could used that to mention more about The Constitution, or some of the people that I previously mentioned, or just excluded it altogether.

With that being said, it's solid overall. Not sure it's the best documentary concerning this, but it's not worth omitting for view. 3.6 out of 5 Stars.",1323820800,,1854,4.6984615384615385
2654261,5,B000IB0DD0,"Great photography and very artistically done. The producer tries to put you near the action as if you are there in camp or on the battlefield.  The actors do a great job, and Mark Collins as George Washington is the best. He looks very much like the leader that Washington was.
This video set is worth the money, and time to watch it. It brings history to life, and is very informative.  If you have trouble just reading a book on the Revolution, you should have no problem with this very visual look at the Revolution.  Great film set, beautifully photographed and filmed.  Highest Recommendation.  A+++",1323475200,,604,4.660377358490566
2654262,5,B000IB0DD0,"I gave it 5 stars so you folks would have the benefit of reading this first before you bought it.

As a historian in Early American History I am insulted by the cadre of idiot experts used to anchor this series.  Ray Raphael, Chadwick, Nash etc....are NOT experts by any stretch of the imagination, to say nothing of the chintzy uniforms and cheap wigs.  While I completely understand that most people do not have the time or interest to investigate the intricacies of our Revolution, there are better documentaries like PBS's ""Liberty"" that are entertaining AND factual.

I get the idea, Hollywood must have its plot, but NOT at the expense of our wearied veterans.  Did it ever occur to anyone that most of the major land battles of the American Revolution took place BEFORE Valley Forge?  That going into this storied encampment the war had been prosecuted for nearly 3 years, and Britain was no closer to victory in 1778 than it was in 1775? Point: by Valley Forge these guys are war-bitten veterans NOT inept farmers!  Did these ""experts"" touting French support stop to analyze the victory at Saratoga with nary a Frenchmen in site?  I'm not privy to every single article of detail, but this junk not only insults your intelligence, but our veterans!

However that being said wanting to enjoy it is completely different than what this movie was able to deliver. It would seem this movie was made by Pro-British and Pro Loyalist directors. Within the first 10 minutes there were so many Slanders toward America I had to turn it off.

It was so bad I was wondering if Kim Jung Il had commissioned the movie to be made to try and lower national patriotism.",1310342400,13,491,4.455555555555556
2654265,3,B000IB0DD0,"Generally informative, but terribly slanders George Washington, claiming he was overly ambitious and deceptive - pretending not to be ambitious to hide his being secretly ambitious. His well-known attempts to cultivate his own character, such as his rules of conduct, are dismissed as tools of ambition. It is an accusation born of the secular historian's insistence that all actors be motivated by selfishness, and not much else, the same hobbled mindset that still cannot comprehend that England ended the slave trade, committing economic suicide, because of Christianity.

His humility is, however, evinced by his life, words and conduct, including his refusal to stay on another term as President, and these pointy-headed critics are not fit to lick his boots. And they know it, thus their repeated attempts at slander. At least, that's my theory. I could be wrong.

A sad blot on this series, which is an otherwise good introduction to the Revolution.",1307750400,14,956,5.241830065359477
2654266,5,B000IB0DD0,"We discovered this 13 part series by accident and are very thankful we found it! The series tells the story of the American Revolution in a manner that is thoroughly captivating, holding the viewer's attention at all times.

This is an excellent video retelling of this historic time that conveys the drama and challenge that faced those brave Americans who endured the times and lived the experiences. The format is documentary and the key players who act out their parts in full costume do not actually speak lines but the narrator quotes from actual documents from the time conveying their thoughts.

Although this may sound strange, it works out very well in practice and one is easily able to follow the action and thoughts of the principal players in this saga. The last two episodes provide a review of the war in the context of Washington's ride to New York for the swearing in ceremony that would make him the first president under the Constitution.

There is one, possibly two strange things about this series; the most obvious is the omission of Lafayette's part in this war; the second would be the very favorable account of Benjamin Franklin's contribution to the successful outcome. Franklin may not have been the sterling character portrayed in the series and Lafayette was most decidedly an important player in the war. I know of no explanation for these two inconsistencies.

Overlooking these two questions, I recommend the series for all ages and encourage families to watch it together as a significant and revealing commentary on the nature and progress of the American Revolution. This is definitely a keeper and worth repeated watchings.",1307491200,3,1660,4.981949458483754
2654267,5,B000IB0DD0,"I have yet to encounter a ""perfect"" film history of the American revolution or founding. This series deserves 5-stars not because it is perfect but because is is an excellent introduction and broad overview that keeps the viewer so engaged one only wishes the series continued to cover even MORE territory!  The series tells a fact-based narrative that, tragically, students in K-12 and college are not likely to encounter at all in today's educational system. If you have kids, I would highly recommend purchasing this to watch with your children. It is both enjoyable viewing for adults and very educational. Some critical reviews here have negatively commented on omissions, but the editors clearly had to make trade-offs regarding what to include from the detail-rich, multi-year history of this period. I think they have done an excellent job.

For anyone familiar with the U.S. educational system today there should be a sense of urgency to view and share such a powerful educational tool as this video series which is entertaining enough to hold one's interest for hours and hours of viewing. Historically factual narrative can provide knowledge that simply WILL NOT be taught in most schools/colleges today; it can also provide an antidote to the pathetic but widely-taught neo-marxist perspective. What do I mean by this? Sadly, one of the most widely used texts to teach American history today is Howard Zinn's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-People-s-History-of-the-United-States-P-S/dp/0061965588/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A People's History of the United States (P.S.)</a>. Academia is filled with such tenured radicals today and it is their perspective that is increasingly dominating the way entire generations of young Americans are taught to view the founding of our nation. As a Boston University history professor, Zinn was a contemporary marxist and political activist posing as a scholar. His appallingly unscholarly and egregiously dishonest agenda was to ""expose"" the ""truth"" of American history as the long march of economic, civil, sexual, political, etc. exploitation and oppression of ""the masses"" by the elites. Although he died last year his widely taught ""history"" lives on to indocdrinate students across the nation. If you doubt this, look at the nearly 900 rave reviews of his book.

For this reason, I wish the History Channel series had laid greater stress on the fact that every signer of the Declaration of Independence knew their signature made them traitors to the Crown for which the penalty was a hideous death by being hung, drawn and quartered; and I wish it had explored the tremendous losses suffered by so many of those signers whose homes, estates and livelihoods were successfully targetted for destruction by the British military when they were not able to aprehend the men themselves.

What are the other weaknesses of this mostly excellent series? I very much disliked the actor they chose to portray George Washington in silent visual re-enactments. In addition to being a poorly skilled actor, his posturing consisted largely of standing, marching or riding about with a never-ending supercilious expression. That constant expression of haughty disdain, and his  doughy facial features and body did not at all convey the historical George Washingon of that time: the powerful 40-something man of action, athletic horseman, and strong leader capable of inspiring great loyalty and near-universal respect among both military subordinates and political colleagues. But those qualities WERE conveyed in the narrator's text, so one can tolerate the annoying pantomime actor.

Finally, do not expect the production values of a Ken Burns documentary. This made-for-TV series had budget constraints. But given that reality, the producers did a very clever job of conveying a visually rich re-telling of a historical period war that ranged across multiple states (and nations).

In short, yes, one can quibble about this or that. It is not a perfect production. But it STILL merits 5-stars because it is an enjoyable, compelling, educational, superior production and a repository of critically important historical facts that are rarely taught properly in our contemporary educational system. As an Ivy League educated student of history, I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series (I've watched it twice!) and look forward to viewing it again with my children, which will be accompanied by many a dinner discussion to bring home the lessons learned. This would also be a complementary classroom tool for that minority of K-12 teachers interested in teaching the genuine, fact-based history of our American founding. Highly recommended for a wide range of viewers interested in fact-based, research-based history in an engaging format!",1306108800,2,4821,5.497975708502024
2654268,3,B000IB0DD0,"""The Revolution"" is very entertaining, and provides in depth insight of ""selected"" perspectives of the revolution.  The re-telling of Benedict Arnold's heroism and treachery, and Gates ineptitude, is solid.  However, this series completely omits the Battle of Kings Mountain, which is a severe disservice to this important battle.  Kings Mountain was the major win of patriots over loyalists, the first significant victory after Gates humiliation at Camden.  To not even mention this battle shows the patchwork nature of the documentary, and it's clearly aimed more at entertainment than at providing a complete picture of the revolution.",1305936000,9,638,5.614583333333333

2654270,3,B000IB0DD0,"The main problem I have with this documentary is the following:

I believe the History Channel should be ashamed of themselves for portraying George Washington as an ambitious, calculating and even incompetent man.  Where much documentation exists of people testifying to Washington's humility and general desire to be a Virginian farmer as opposed to a politician, they dismiss this... even insinuate that his ""pretended"" sense of duty was some great plan for military and political ambition.  They mentioned nothing of his connection to ""Providence""... how he prayed regularly- and was seen so doing- nor how he insisted that his men prayed also.  They've taken a humble, great man and tried to turn him into something completely different.  If you'd like a true picture of this wonderful, God-inspired man, please read the following book:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Real-George-Washington-American-Classic-Series/dp/0880800143/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Real George Washington (American Classic Series)</a>.

The commentary from the invited experts (all of whom are great) is of a uniformly high standard.  All up, this is a good intro to a fascinating and complex period of history.  This presentation is especially suited for high schoolers and casual revolution buffs.  Lots of good basic material here.
However, where the series disappoints is in its unfortunate tendency to be repetitious (at times tediously so) and its simplified treatment of a wondrously complex and interwoven period of history.  The invited experts make many interesting and insightful comments that are left hanging rather than to be examined in the detail they deserve.  A number of important events are glossed over (or left out) yet some minor events are referred to ad nauseam.  Finally, while the narration is good, the narrative thread is surprisingly weak for such a powerful story line.

2654272,3,B000IB0DD0,"Watching this presentation is better than not watching any; however it falls prey to the standard history Channel problems and maybe more so. First of all it is in soundbite presentation which means one presenter makes a one-liner statement without following through with what was meant by that one line; then we gets a quick over dramatic reenactment of some sort of act without any supporting background or context. Possibly due to the fact that this is a composite of several programs better than half of the presentation is repeating and repeating then repeating. If they were going to build a composite they could have cut out all the repetitive statements. If you wait long enough you will find a few unique grains of information in the entire shaft. But who wants to dig through all the shaft and repetitiveness and the superficiality defined one or two useful grains of information?

2654278,1,B000IB0DD0,"My comments are for the whole volume of 'The Revolution'. I've watched it more than once.

While great effort went into production, and many decent people participated, the narrative tone, scripting, editing, and inclusion of inaccuracies serve to slander and subvert American heritage. The exaggerated focus on individual character flaws, in general, is an attempt to distract the viewer from realizing the full importance of events by focusing on what are relative trivialities. Some other insults to our heritage are subtle, but serve to further the cause of any that would argue the American fight for Independence was in vain, that life over the centuries would be little different if we'd remained under British control. Indifferent viewers or patriots may tend to understandably gloss over or miss these jabs, so that they can enjoy the rest of the material.

What WWII documentary would bother to mention the infidelities or perverseness of minor players in the FDR administration?
Why doesn't 'Josh Bartlett' in the NBC series ""The West Wing"", stumble around looking down at his cohorts as if they were strange aliens exhibiting incomprehensible behavior, possessing no intelligence?

Some of the most famous American phrases repeated for generations are altered... for what purpose?
""One if by land, two if by sea"", became
""One if by land, two if by boat""

Even if the latter phrase was that spoken in April, 1775, I've never heard that. Perhaps the History Channel is more worried about people reading Henry Wadsworth Longfellow or Ralph Waldo Emerson, and wanted to avoid mentioning the phrase that might encourage such. Wouldn't want the citizens finding the Minuteman National Park or reading the radical words that appear below the statue of Isaac Davis.

The Continental Army was described as a ""regular, permanent Army"", an absolute untruth that should have been edited out. I can only surmise the educator either mispoke, is an amateur, or willfully wishes to deceive. The list of errors is moderate. The bulk of injury is from a condescending stance towards America, a good dose of obnoxious acting from some, and an obseqious attitude towards the British. Any honest person well educated in early American history and the war that complains the birth of our nation has sometimes been overly promoted to a state of undue reverence would also have to admit that 'The Revolution' is soap opera propaganda created in hopes of swaying those that do not understand history, and for the benefit of those that wish to further move our Republic away from the founding principles. Another miscalculation by some working for Vivendi Universal/G.E./N.B.C.  The General Electric corporation has since taken the positive move of divesting itself of some Vivendi Universal / N.B.C. assets.

Always remember at the start of the War, at Lexington Battle Green, 18 Americans lay dead or wounded, with one British soldier wounded. Intent of the two armed parties remains clear. One came on the offense, the other stood to defend. The American orders of the day, ""Stand your ground. Don't fire unless fired upon""

  On this green bank, by this soft stream,
  We set today a votive stone;
  That memory may their deed redeem,
  When, like our sires, our sons are gone.

  Spirit, that made those heroes dare,
  To die, and leave their children free,
  Bid Time and Nature gently spare
  The shaft we raise to them and thee.

  By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
  Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,
  Here once the embattled farmers stood
  And fired the shot heard round the world.
  --Ralph Waldo Emerson, excerpts

""Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire, called conscience.""

I wish to congratulate the many that did participate earnestly, and in the spirit of truth and freedom, in the making of 'The Revolution'. Your efforts were hardly overwhelmed by those of the disingenuous, and your work was not in vain. Ours may never be a perfect Union, but I have faith you will keep trying, as will those in the audience with a strong thirst for freedom. There is no need to always revel, but to dutifully regard.

NO MORE KINGS!

There are chapters broken down that can be used to specific subjects and events and the discs are easy to use.  Student feedback has always been positive about this series because the way it is reenacted.  It is not a typical documentary but it does have historians discussing topics throughout the clips.

2654281,5,B000IB0DD0,"I teach American History and recently completed a master's degree in that field, which is to say, I'm a life-long student of history. First, I certainly appreciated that the producers/directors of The Revolution had to create a 1770's era backdrop from scratch, since the time in question was before photography. They surely succeeded, and they did so without the typical documentary talking heads syndrome. I'd recommend this film series to students of history, teachers, and for those who simply want to know much more about America's beginnings.

I'd also like to say that the producers/directors were smart to include issues concerning topics like Thomas Paine's Common Sense, slavery, the Royalist versus Patriot collisions, the goings-on in France with Benjamin Franklin, and the struggles at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. They, in other words, covered many topics that contributed to the outcome of the war, the creation of the radically innovative U.S. Government, and the installation of George Washington as America's first president, being sure not to focus just on key battles. One comes away from The Revolution with a solid understanding of why Americans sought to break from the British Empire and with an appreciation for the incredible luck and bloody resolve it took to do so. One also sees how smug and generally elitist the British were and how their arrogance cost them their thirteen colonies.

I read in other reviews that some people felt that the video series had too much redundancy in terms of certain video clips/scenes and the like. I suppose there might be a ""little"" bit of truth to that, but given the fact that the entire colonial era video backdrop had to be generated from scratch, which took lots of actors, costumes/uniforms, and time-era scene development, such criticism is surely moot. I even like the way the producers/directors utilized a sound track that created a kind of Bourne Identity-like anxiety - good work!

Several rounds of applause go to the producers and directors of The Revolution for making such a comprehensive, intelligent, and balanced video series!

2654282,4,B000IB0DD0,"I enjoyed this documentary very much. I watched this with my children and was pleased that it was well-paced, and that some parts were repetitive as I think that helped re-orient them to what was going on. There was a lot of re-using of the same scene shots; obviously an effort to keep their budget under control, but still somewhat unfortunate. With a little ingenuity, they could have used different angles etc. and it would have greatly enhanced the production. The acting for the 'main characters' is the weakest part of the production, and seems to devolve: to 1) pacing in front of a window, tracing their finger along a map, and drinking wine. Surely, someone at the History Channel can be a little more creative in imagining scenes than this?  Lastly, not to quibble over much with what is really a fine production, but there were some historical inconsistencies that were a little weird. For example, John Parke Custis is identified as George Washington's son---and the film seems to infer that George & Martha had children together (obviously not the case)---and that John/Jackie was quite young when he died--when, in fact, he was a grown man with 5 children of his own. However, all in all, I would definitely recommend this series --particularly for kids 8 and up interested in history (mild gore during battle scenes). Adults will probably find it a little less compelling for the reasons listed.",1259884800,,1411,4.879166666666666

This presentation by The History Channel is a superb production that succeeds in doing justice to its great theme.  Happily, the historian-commentators are much less annoying in this production than they were in ""Founding Fathers"" and they actually contribute to it, rather than detract. (I truly wish that there was an option in ""Founding Fathers"" to simply delete the annoying historian-commentators altogether.  They were condescending and simply awful.)

The production does a highly creditable job of explaining the American Revolution from its beginnings as a protest against taxation by Britain to a social phenomenon that was to create a new nation.  The military campaigns that were necessary to win the Revolution for the Americans are thoroughly, and I think accurately, explained.  The re-enactments are very nicely done, and the film also does a very good job of using maps to help the viewer understand some of the military difficulties that both sides faced.

This item would be a good purchase for someone who is developing a love of American history and for someone who is totally in love with the American experience.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this set.  It can be viewed again and again, and you will always get something new.  Nathanael Green was the best.",1210204800,4,539,4.955555555555556

I was a little disappointed at the lack of detail in the PBS series.  This one by the history has the detail I wanted and is very interesting and well done.  Being honest with you, you'd swear the series was taken directly from the book ""Patriots"" by J Langguth, because if follows the exact same approach, though there is no apparent credit given to Lagguth in the video series.",1208736000,13,500,4.533333333333333

  There is left little for me to add to the Reviews already given here, but such little I gladly offer.

  Andrew Violette's Review (see below) is clear, succinct and contains the best part of what I look for in a good review.  I will say however, that I would disagree that the very few instances of repeated material throughout is in any sense or manner a detraction from the whole.
  After all, inculcation is itself a perfectly legitimate method of `teaching' and imparting important, complex and/or meaningful information, and the visual scenes which may be repeated here and there are in no way detracting, as the whole is done with impeccably good taste, style and an almost epic grandeur.
  Indeed, the few instances of repetition are so brief and far between, one hardly notices.  If the content itself weren't so forceful in beauty and import the first time, one would probably not notice it at all.
  In all events, rather than finding such to be a fault or `problem' in the series taken as a whole, I regard it simply one more aspect which deepens and enriches its instructional value.

  On the whole, ""The Revolution"" is a Masterful documentary production, brilliantly executed, sweeping and breathtaking in scope and in every sense, a First Rate production for a `Principle Events and Characters' overview of the American Revolution (with emphases placed squarely on the Martial aspects - as well it should be: as is rightly said by one historian - ""The Army is the Revolution"").
  I know of no other like Documentary Series which so lavishly and tastefully achieves this rather daunting task.

  We all know that in life and `this world' as it were, we rarely if ever encounter anything we deem `perfect' in every sense.  So what?
  That one might find something to criticize can surprise no-one, yet it is a shame I think to allow such to detract from what is as a whole a genuinely masterful achievement.

  My husband and I frankly tire-ourselves at times criticizing the `usual' self-serving, ignorant, poorly directed, mismanaged, bungled & botched documentary on this or that historical subject.
  To come across a documentary series such as this is such a refreshing exception, I cannot help but sing its praises.
  Without the faintest hint of hesitation, I recommend this Superb series to anyone interested in the American Revolution, be they wholly ignorant of the subject, amateur history buff or professional historian.
  Whether one is learning something new from beginning to end, or learns nothing new whatever, it is simply a delight to behold and, I will say - worth every *American* penny spent.

  For the Review comments of John Aldrich (see below), all I can think is that he must unfortunately have gotten either defective disks or have some other technical issues.
  I have seen no `white dots' or lines and that it is in letterbox format (which I genuinely cannot stand), frankly, I hadn't even noticed until I made conscious effort to look.
  Nothing is lacking in the brilliantly clear DVD quality one has every right to expect; nor is there any shortcoming as regards the manner in which it was filmed.  It certainly doesn't look like `video.'
  I thought it looked brilliant when watching it on cable and recording to DVR - the DVD version only seems yet more clear and glittering, to me.

  In short, a positively First Rate production in every respect and highly recommended.
  One documentary series I will joyfully watch again & again with repeated, if not ever-increasing pleasure and appreciation.
  If only this achievement might become the Standard by which all future documentaries are produced - I would have No complaints ...

8144685,3,B000IB0DD0,"This production is very informative and lengthy enough to cover the entire Revolutionary War about as well as possible, in my humble opinion. Yet, where the production lacks are in important areas, enough to possibly warrant a rating of only 3 stars (but I have given 4 because I enjoyed watching it so much). Here they are: 1.) Not nearly enough time by proportion is given to the many ""battles"" being fought off the battle field in the halls of the assemblies and in letters between statesmen and in diplomatic efforts overseas (only Franklin's in France is given any attention). Remember that this film series is called ""The Revolution"", and although one historian is quoted as saying ""The War is the Revolution"", if not for so many critical decisions and events and efforts of equally brave men who did not fight on the front lines, the outcome would have been quite different. So, it doesn't make sense, in my view, to focus nearly all of the attention (save mainly the first episode) on the War effort itself, and give the film series a title that suggest it covers the Revolution in general (dedicating so much effort to covering the Revolution in chronological detail but failing to cover many important speeches, letters, events, and diplomatic efforts with other nations to secure funding and supplies etc. during the War even in passing mention, many of them). 2.) On a stylistic/technical note, many of the same film sequences and shots are used for almost comically different settings in the series, often opposite sides or opposite locations or entirely different events. It happens so frequently that suspension of disbelief becomes impossible and distraction sets in, marring the enjoyment somewhat of the series and making it difficult to ""get in the zone""; 3.) I am at the end of the series at the time of writing this, and I have yet to hear one quote or letter or narrative statement or anything even so much as mentioning the word ""God"" or indicating an appeal to God or supplication in prayer etc. There may have been something in passing here and there, but it is so conspicuously absent that I can easily be forgiven for not catching or remember it, if it even exist, and it is especially conspicuously absent in light of the real, historic record and the sentiments of the characters involved throughout the series. It is hard to imagine how this happened naturally, when so much detail and attention and thoroughness is paid to all other aspects of the history behind the film. Me thinks that the film company that made the documentary for the H. Channel did so with the decided intent of going so far to cast a secular tint to the film that they ignored the realities of the history they purported to cover. It's one thing to not believe in God or in prayer and to even disdain religion, the Christian religion in general, but it is entirely another to pretend that the beginnings of America did not contain any of it to any large degree and that Washington and other leaders were as secular as modern American leaders in their pursuits (even more so, for even recent American presidents made efforts to pay tribute to God and Christianity in America's founding and in their own modern day speeches and writings). I do not understand why something so deliberate would be done, except to accept that an agenda to secularize American history and to whitewash it of its critical Christian elements was afoot in the minds, hearts, and hands of this series' creators. So, as this realization sets in, I am withdrawing that measure of goodwill that led me to give the film 4 stars and dropping it three instead. This failure is more than technical or an oversight or a minor failure, but a serious flaw. One does not have to sanction or condone the Christian influences of the American founding and the Revolution to simply cover it truthfully from a historical standpoint.

UPDATE: I finished watching the program tonight, and it is not until the very, very end (last episode, last few minutes) that the word ""Bible"" and ""God"" are mentioned (to my memory), that being by a single historian (not by the narrator) in recounting details about the inauguration of President Washington.",1467590400,3,4203,4.789256198347108
