2559911,5,B000FBP0CW,"If you have had any excuse as to why you can't do yoga, get this video. If you are suffering with pain or injuries get this video. Whether you are bedridden, having trouble walking  or are just out of shape and don't feel capable of walking into even a beginning yoga class without a little help this is the video for you. My sister-in-law who does not, I repeat not exercise is using this video. I had got it for my mom to help her train for her marathons that she walks (she's 63) and just to extend her life. She showed it to my brother and apparently while it was laying around his house his wife tried it out just out of curiosity. Please remember getting my sister-in-law to do any exercise is amazing. Get this, she now does it regularly with her two little daughters including the breathing exercises. I've got my family members doing yoga thanks to this video. My mother due to her age and her marathon participation does get some injuries. This video provides the opportunity for recuperative exercises to do when she can't do her walking training due to a knee or foot strain. Heck, if you (or your kids) do nothing more than the breathing exercises you will be a step ahead of most and much more serene. I believe in this video and its instructor because I have seen her work and its results first hand in Los Angeles. She heals people with her methods. If you want feel better and also get rid of reasons you shouldn't do yoga or exercise get this video.",1198108800,8,1467,4.373626373626373

Even if you are bed bound and physicially deconditioned you should be able to do the breathing segment, which I personally found to be beneficial as it is calming, and relaxing. Be sure and watch the entire DVD. It's uplifting and gave me hope. Definately worth the money!",1172016000,56,340,4.5
2559913,5,B000FBP0CW,"This DVD has a soothing ambiance and extraordinary yoga instructions.  It makes Yoga accessible to everyone.  I love the gradated classes.  The interviews are very inspiring.  I am a Yoga instructor and assumed this DVD would be too basic for me.  However, the careful attention to detail was illuminating.  Then I got the flu and was in bed for three days-yuk.  I was going stir crazy and put on the DVD.  The Bed/Mat Yoga Practice was the perfect yoga session for me.  It was just enough to help stimulate my body's healing powers and I was back on my feet in no time!  Great holiday gift idea.",1163030400,28,596,4.485981308411215

It has about 6 routines from easy to hard. I have really never gotten to the hardest ones, so. I think any one at any age or any physical condition could enjoy it.

2559917,4,B000FBP0CW,"I have fibromyalgia'I was desperate to do something about it that is why I bought this DVD. I have been doing the gentle yoga only so far . The health and strength yoga is too much for me I got really tired after I tried it and my mood was really down the next day. Some gentle yoga also didn't work for me like ""legs on a chair"" affects my mood too so I skip. My fibromyalgia got better than before but I have to be very careful which pose I choose. I guess this is the best one so far so I gave four stars but I was hoping a little better result .",1420502400,3,549,3.782608695652174

2559919,2,B000FBP0CW,I was hoping for something different.  This doesn't flow and there is little explanation on how and why to modify. I think of it more of a video dictionary.

2559920,5,B000FBP0CW,"I have fibromyalgia and arthritis and I have good days and bad...so trying to do yoga to stretch, as is recommended, can be very hard with a traditional yoga program.  Sarah has made an excellent program that incorporates breathing techniques, poses for those that need more assistance or are having an ""off day"" and can't do as much, and also regular poses and more involved techniques for those that are more limber and can do regular yoga poses.  There are sections for each, as well as getting you familiar with yoga poses, and how to breathe.  I would recommend this to anyone who has joint issues, or has doctor recommendations for starting a yoga routine.",1393027200,8,662,4.739130434782608

2559922,5,B000FBP0CW,I have been physically deconditioned for many years due to multiple health conditions.  I have tried many therapies and feel that a lot of therapists do NOT understand fibromyalgia.  I flared after every short session and became very depressed and lacked hope.  What I love about Yoga for healing is that I can do parts of it even when I flared and in bed but also gives me room to grow as I heal.  It gives me hope that I CAN get better... and better is good!

Yoga for Healing allows me to exercise at whatever level I need to on any given day - from just breathing & stretching to a full yoga workout.  My hope is to one day be able to fully exercise again and I believe I can do this with Sarah's help.  She truly ""gets it"" which is so encouraging!!

2559932,5,B000FBP0CW,"I love this dvd! I was saddened when I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I missed being able to keep up with my yoga program - not all that advanced either. This is a great way to get the blood flowing, stretch, and keep functionality of muscle groups. I also find it very relaxing.",1329523200,4,281,4.320754716981132
2559933,5,B000FBP0CW,"I was cautious about getting this video since I knew nothing about it and the price for me was high under the circumstances.  I also didn't want a video with all the ""extreme yoga"" meditations, moves and music.  However, the selling point for me was that this was supposed to be good for Fibromyalgia, which I have among other things.  My physical therapist also recommended yoga for strength and stretching.  All in all I figured that it was worth a shot.  I'm SO GLAD I DID!  This video is just what I was looking for! Sarah has a very soothing voice, there is none of the meditation stuff, and the music is quite calming. The video is broken into segments so you can do breathing, stretching, bed or chair exercises (great if you are in pain, elderly or just want a lower key regimine), stronger core strengthening poses, and extra relaxation poses.  I couldn't be happier with these sessions and I know that I will use this consistently for years.  If you are a hard core yogi, this probably isn't for you, but for those who aren't into yoga, those who want to de-stress from life, and for those in pain, this is a real deal!!",1326931200,37,1130,4.451456310679611

2559936,5,B000FBP0CW,I have bought a few slower pace yoga DVDs to help me with my stress and back/shoulder pain.  This DVD is by far the best.  It is very relaxing and the segments are long enough so that you have plenty of time to settle into the pose and reap the full benefit of this type of yoga.  For anyone who is struggling with constant fatigue/muscle pain this DVD could really help you.  It has helped me and I have only been doing it for 10 days.  Awesome DVD.,1314921600,6,450,4.068181818181818
2559937,5,B000FBP0CW,"After years of trying to cope with Fibromyalgia I am so thankful to have found Yoga for Healing! It is the first form of Exercise I can do. Everything else I have tried always makes me feel worse, this doesn't. I have only been practicing for a short while but I don't like to miss even a day. I think some of the negative reviews that have been posted may be because we are all hoping for a quick miracle cure. I'm not saying this is it but it is movement, adding flexability, and aiding in relaxation. I feel like this will help make my life better. After much research I am very glad I chose Sarah's dvd. She understands where we are coming from and has designed this program especially for those who can not do what the general population can do. Thank you so much Sarah for putting yourself out there and offering us hope! Blessings to you!",1309996800,24,845,4.2875
2559938,5,B000FBP0CW,"Please try this for at least 2 weeks faithfully before you make your mind up it isn't going to help. It is GREAT :) and it WORKS :). I watched it through and then did a session and then the breathing session and decide this is going to do nothing. I was used to 1 hour sessions at a gym that got to strenuous for me because of my Fibro progressing so much. And I missed it tremendously. I saw Sarah's DVD and was excited because she had Fibro also and would know what to teach me. Well when I found the short gentle sessions I immediately decided this is nothing. Well it really is something and it is wonderful for my moods, peace of mind, and my pain. The relaxation is terrific and helps to mediate something I wasn't able to do with the other class because of the disturbance of others in the class. Now it is just me and Sarah and I LOVE. Yes do buy this program and give it time to take effect you will be glad you Did.
Eating Crow Now.

2559939,4,B000FBP0CW,"I have been doing the Gentlest Yoga exercises for about two months now. I really like the graduated approach and the variety of exercises. Like Sarah mentions in the DVD, the exercises appear simple but can be challenging to master. I have had muscle pain (with depression) for about a year now, and I bought this DVD coz it appeared appropriate for my condition.

What I really like about the DVD: Sarah gives sensible instructions on how to approach practice. Her yoga instructions are very clear. She guides you very gently through each pose. I am a kind who much prefers attending a yoga class. I would never have thought I would practise yoga with the help of a DVD (I still maintain that if your new to your yoga, approach a good teacher who can help you understand the basics - that's my opinion). However, this DVD is very complete - you feel like you're guided by a teacher every class; instructions are clear; you won't really do a pose ""incorrectly"" unless you're really not paying attention to what Sarah says!; there are a variety of poses to work your whole body completely and gently.

I really appreciate the written instructions Sarah has put together before each set. For e.g., she tells you to rest ""before"" you feel fatigued. I think that's an important pt especially if you're ill and looking to build back strength and flexibility.

Sarah appears to be a established teacher. I think she has put in a lot of thought to come up with a complete set of exercises for rehabilitation. That said, it would be nice to have a set of exercises for common challenges - like knee pain, neck pain.

What I may not get from this DVD: Like I mentioned above, this DVD may not help me specifically with a weak knee. And sometimes, I am afraid I may strain my knee with some of the poses. This is where it helps to be supervised. Once I pick up my fitness, I would think I'd go and meet a teacher live. And oh, I am also interested to know why Sarah chose the particular set of exercises she did - it would be nice if she gave a little primer on why the particular poses are important for well-being. I think it would add a lot of value to the DVD. You know why you're doing something - and not just blindly twisting your body. Also, I think the DVD could focus more on breath control; maybe it's beyond the scope of this DVD - I don't know.

Overall, I think this DVD is great for me to stretch, calm down, lightly strengthen in the comfort of my own home.

Thanks Sarah for your hard work and thoughtfulness. I hope you continue to do the good work you're doing and share with others in pain what you've learnt from your own experience.",1304726400,7,2644,4.385714285714286
2559940,2,B000FBP0CW,I was expecting a lot more from this DVD based on the reviews and the fact that it was priced significantly higher than others of the same description.  The props used in the poses are difficult to find and also expensive.  I will probably not bothering to view it again because of this.,1296864000,7,287,4.39622641509434
2559941,5,B000FBP0CW,This video is not for someone in shape but if you have a difficult time with movement as do I with fibromyalgia this is helping me slowly. I love to just do the stretching routine some days when I am particularily sore and others some of the strengthining yoga which I really need as I have been sedentary for too long.,1291075200,2,319,4.245901639344262

Loved the way this starts out with easy relaxation and floor/bed routine before you move on to sitting and standing routines.  I can work at my own pace and do not feel intimidated by the instructor doing moves I can not do.  I do not feel overwhelmed as in other videos.  Loved the stories of the instructor and the people in the video, great inspiration!",1283126400,4,434,4.443037974683544

When I exercised and I'd have a flareup even my truly wonderful doctor and  my wonderful physical therapist would suggest that I hadn't been listening to my body.  I lost trust in my capacity to read my body.  I've hunted and hunted for a program that took into account my limitations - that would start me off from ground zero.  Sara Bates's really, truly understands the nature of Fibromyalgia. With her program,  I don't feel on the outskirts looking in at all the ""normal"" people.  I feel like this program was made just for me. I am SO GRATEFUL!!!!!!",1281916800,4,685,4.528455284552845

2559950,5,B000FBP0CW,"I was so thankful to find this DVD. The instructor describes her personal and initially devastating experience with Fibromyalgia, and how she used yoga to help her recover and eventually teach. Seeing someone who had described herself as for a while unable to do anything but go to a yoga class and practice breathing under a blanket on the floor, who was now so strong, made me feel brave enough to try. As someone with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS) and Fibromyalgia, and also someone who has tried a lot of yoga DVDs, I was so happy to find something I could finally do no matter how bad my day is. The breathing exercises are really doable for nearly anyone who's bed-bound, and the meditation session was more helpful than anything I've found on 20 DVDs. I memorized and do it at night to fall asleep now.
It's great that the DVD also has stretching and strengthening sections so that students can progress in their health, without hurting themselves trying to do one of those programs that focuses more on fat-burning than safety. The instructor is very capable in teaching students with various illnesses and disabilities in a compassionate way. Great DVD! (I also recommend the ""Sit and Be Fit"" series, which can be found on PBS and includes a Fibro DVD that can be bought on Amazon, as well as ""Kundalini Yoga to Detox and Destress with Maya Fiennes,"" which I was amazed that I both could do and found really inspirational and enjoyable.)",1279152000,24,1451,4.739130434782608

2559952,5,B000FBP0CW,"I have waited many years for a way to access yoga that respects the experience of the Fibromyalgia sufferer. Sarah Bates has done an exemplary job with this DVD. The exercises feel appropriate for my body's limitations and variations (different pain on different days) and Sarah delivers them in a clear and measured way that makes the information 'stick' even when I have fibro-fog. Most of all, I find Sarah's voice and presentation style to be a perfect fit for me; she seems like an authentic woman with a deep passion for yoga, for the sharing of knowledge and for those who, like her, suffer chronic pain. I highly recommend the purchase of this DVD - it's a tool that has made a big difference in my daily life, both physically and as a mood-booster. The packaging itself is beautifully designed and the on-screen menu is easy to follow and navigate. [My background: I have had Fibromyalgia for 16 years.

2559954,5,B000FBP0CW,I had just been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and my doctor told me that I needed to start doing yoga.  He said that it would relieve some of my pain along with more exercise.  I came home and searched the Internet and came across this site about fibromyalgia with exercise DVDs.  There were so many yoga DVDs.  Just so happen Yoga for Healing was on the second page.  I read the reviews and I decided this was the one for me.  Reviews are so important!!  The price of the DVD seemed a little steep from me so I waited about two weeks and finally I told my husband I was getting it.  I wish I had gotten it when I first saw it!!  This is an awesome DVD!!! Its inspirational and its empowering and its helped me with my pain and its EASY!!!!  I would so recommend this to anyone who has fibromyalgia whether you are 20 or 80 years old.

I am over 60, and have FM and OA, and I have been looking for something that would give me some strength without causing me more pain.
Then I listened to the testimony from Sarah and her students.  I felt the tears well up in my eyes as I heard other human beings speak of the same type of pain experiences that I have, and they got BETTER using Sarah's techniques.  This gave me a renewed sense of hope.
Sarah will inspire you, and you will gain a wealth of information on how to help yourself through yoga when you aquire this DVD. I am so thrilled to be embarking on this new journey towards less PAIN.",1253836800,7,751,4.28169014084507

The variety of practice options allows you to choose one that fits how you feel each day and the supportive tone helps you to feel good about what you can do, even if it's only the breath work.

There are several practices on the DVD, varying in length and what you are looking for out of your practice, either energy or relaxation. I'm so glad I ordered this, I hope to build my strength back up to be able to do the longer practices on the DVD. Highly recommend.",1252886400,9,530,4.363636363636363
2559959,5,B000FBP0CW,"This DVD is awesome. I have fibromyalgia and arthritis. It has helped so much to be more calm with the breathing exercises and the slow stretching is amazing. I found myself to be more limber and not as tight in the muscles.
You can proceed at your own pace and feel like you have truly accomplished something. I love it. I would recommend it for anyone.",1252540800,3,354,4.378787878787879
2559960,5,B000FBP0CW,"I have ankylosing spondylitis and need to maintain flexibility to avoid further fusion of my vertebrae.  However, due to pain from the condition regular yoga dvd's have not been helpful.  This DVD was and is amazing.  I've gotten my flexibility back and am now able to walk without pain.  I attribute 50% of my healing to using this DVD 3 times a week.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone with a muscular-skeletal condition.",1252454400,5,426,4.702702702702703
2559961,5,B000FBP0CW,"I am a very physically active 55-year old woman who is in recovery from a stroke that I had about 2 years ago. I am having a good recovery, focusing on walking, riding bikes, and Tai Chi and building at a snail's pace. I am making very slow, but steady progress. Everytime I reach a plateau, it is important to challenge myself with a new activity. This time, I chose gentle yoga and purchased a variety of DVDs. This is by far the best one! The instructor really gets it- even though I do not have fibromyalgia I was inspired by her story and the stories of the members of the class. When you have a stroke, the experts often tell you there is no recovery after the first year. That is not true! As long as you keep challenging yourself you can continue to make progress. As long as you can do a tiny bit, you can build on it, even if the progress is glacially slow. This is kind of the tone of this DVD. Everyone can start somewhere and then try to build on it. I am very hopeful that the gentle yoga will stimulate further the power of my body to heal itself!

PS I have been practicing the postures on this DVD for 1 year now, and I really feel better and can move more easily. I started to feel better the first week, and am now motivated to keep adding on to my practice. Kudos to Sarah!",1242604800,17,1293,4.1106719367588935
2559962,5,B000FBP0CW,"I'm lucky to have taken classes with Sarah. She has moved away but I can still do her DVD which I do at leat 6 days a week. It is amazing and the best one out there.  I have bought other YogaDVDs and they are too fast, don't give enough instruction... whereas Sarah does everything..especially the breathing. I have Fibromyalgia, so this is a daily must to keep the pain level down. It really helps.",1202601600,56,399,4.32
2559963,5,B000FBP0CW,"I'm not your normal yoga type and I am easily intimidated by yoga practitioners who overstress the athletic and/or the spiritual.  Sarah Bates is simply the best yoga teacher I have ever come across and she has made yoga a major part of my life.  I'm 60 and in okay shape, never very athletic, but Yoga for Healing is easing my way into middle age ;).  I'm stronger, more stable, and feel better.  The video includes easy to follow 20 minute sessions.  I've taken it all over the world.  In fact, I've worn my copy out and need to get a new one!",1200096000,58,545,4.242718446601942
8120421,1,B000FBP0CW,"I wanted yoga for Fibromyalgia and this advertised that it was. It's not really. Some of the positions are not Fibromyalgia tender points friendly and there are no alternative positions. I thought I'd skip the first parts when I couldn't do the laying on the side positions. There are too many required equipment and as a person on limited income, this is very discouraging. Unless you have a lot of money and a lot less tender points than the average Fibromyalgia sufferers, this isn't the yoga for you.",1501804800,3,504,4.738636363636363

I am sure it may be good, unfortunately she had moves where you leaned against the wall to do some of the moves and I have no walls that I can lean on and still see the tv screen.

I will hang on to the Healing Yoga by Sarah Bates for the future, as I have Fibromyalgia too, and might need to utilize the techniques within.",1439424000,,417,4.5
