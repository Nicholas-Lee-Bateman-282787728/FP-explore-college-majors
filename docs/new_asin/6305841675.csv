1083123,4,6305841675,This is Lowell George's Feats and it's pretty cool. It takes a couple of songs for them to get warmed up and then they throw more grease in the pan and start cooking. A great version of Day at the Dog Races although LG  leaves the stage as he was won't to do when things got a little to Jazz  like. You can also hear what a great voice Richie Hayward has as he was a  little UP in the mix. I love the feats. It was cool seeing the LG version  again.,961200000,6,449,3.795698924731183
1083124,5,6305841675,"This video has been bootlegged for years, but those bootleg copies were always grainy, especially if you were using VHS. Finally, an authorized version! Lowell's widow, Elizabeth George, and Little Feat worked with the RockPalast people to release this video.
If it's at least as good as the  bootlegged versions, it's well worth the money. It was recorded in 1977,  about the time that Waiting For Columbus (which is on quite a few  best-live-album-ever lists) was recorded. This video is a great archive of  that era.

1083171,5,6305841675,"This DVD shows a great band on a great night. The clothes, the songs, and the production are very 70's, but that's what you want when you're hearing Little Feat. It's a good one!",1124236800,3,178,4.264705882352941
1083172,5,6305841675,"A fantastic dvd! for me the first actual footage showing Lowell George and the other instrument voodoo wizards in a state of, perhaps, jet-lag? Rockpalast was the prime rock program at that time. On this DVD, the sound is awful, the performance is about 60% of Waiting for Columbus, and still the concert is magic to me. And I agree with other reviewers, the absolute gem is the bonus ""Cold, Cold, Cold"", good sound, well played, and a far better quality (I 'm not saying this simply because I'm Dutch) then the Rockpalast concert. Lowell's voice is record quality. They all seem much more concentrated. Although no one, not even Bill Payne and Paul Barrere seems to have clue, I can see from everything that it's not a German concert, but a Dutch, recorded at the Pinkpop festival on June 7, 1976. Other acts at that festival, visited by 40,000 fans, were the Jess Roden Band, Streetwalkers, Outlaws, Chieftains, and Uriah Heep. Pinkpop was broadcasted live on Dutch television, so more footage should be somewhere! Anyway, a must have for everyone who loves Little Feat.",1076889600,7,1072,4.8
1083173,3,6305841675,"I've got the DVD and compared to the 20 other concert DVD's I own this one has the WORST film quality, but hey where else are you going to see Lowell live?",1065398400,2,155,3.875
1083174,5,6305841675,"Having been a huge Little Feat fan since 1974, this video was a very special experience for me. Yes, the A/V quality is not quite up to what we now expect out of DVD's today, but nevertheless, I was enthralled by the sheer brilliance, energy and cohesiveness of the band in it's 70's hay day. Prior to watching this DVD, I knew Lowell George's superb talent only from the brilliant Feat recordings. Actually seeing George perform one realizes perhaps for the first time the enormity of the loss of this great musician. No fan of Little Feat, or rock and roll in general, should miss this DVD!",1060300800,3,592,4.542056074766355
1083175,4,6305841675,"I was lucky to chat with Bruce about this show. It was filmed for German TV, and he said that the band before his (I don't recall who) just put the crowd into a bored stupor. You can even see it in their faces as the shows starts.
By the time Bruce and co took to the stage, this crowd had already been on their feet for hours, and so he saw it as something of a challenge to get them going again. They deliberately started with an up tempo Night on the Town, and pretty much maintained that pace throughout.
The picture quality (it's very dark in there) and some surreal camera angles take away from the DVD slightly, but you wouldn't expect that to detract from the music. It doesn't.
Now can we have something more recent?!?",1048636800,7,727,4.237410071942446
1083176,5,6305841675,"I love this band and it's great to be able to see them perform live when they were in ther prime.  The quality of the picture is good and the sound is good besides the fact that the drummer's backing vocals sometimes drowned out Lowell's voice.
 Besides that it's great!",1047168000,2,270,4.38
1083177,5,6305841675,"My God, what a treat to watch this video. As some of the other reviews have noted, the audio mix can be off-center--so don't buy it looking for some AV masterpiece. What this concert is all about is Lowell George. As a young guitarist learning and growing in the 1970s, Lowell was--and still is--one of my heroes. A one-of-a-kind singer, songwriter, and an absolutely singular talent on slide guitar--I still put him ahead of Bonnie Raitt, Ry Cooder, David Lindley, Duane Allman--everybody. Lowell was the king. I won't mince words: he plays his [rear] off.
As I said, the sound can be a bit disconcerting, but the vibe of the performance comes shining through. This band was peaking at this juncture (1977), and the grooves they hit are as deep as the Grand Canyon. This music brings back lots of memories, and it made the hair on the back of my head (or at least what is left of it!) stand up.
I have had the pleasure of seeing the post-Lowell Feat three times, and they are still great. Long may you play on, Little Feat--you guys still are great. But, boy, do I miss Lowell--so thanks for this video.",1046649600,5,1104,4.525
1083178,5,6305841675,"At last, a video to help us remember what the Feat were like when Lowell was in the band.  Granted, they are tighter now however this is a must for long time feat fans.  Sehr gut!",1019174400,,179,3.9444444444444446
1083179,5,6305841675,Saw the Feat about a dozen times back in the 70s in Atlanta and this DVD shows what a great performance they gave at live shows and how much we miss Lowell.  Both of my sons are Wide Spread Panic fans and when they viewed this DVD they said they see where Wide Spread got some of their material. They have also viewed this DVD with their various friends about ten times since we got this DVD last week. This is a must in your collection if you like to Boggie.,1009238400,3,459,4.043956043956044

1083208,5,6305841675,I'm a longtime fan and to be able to have a decent DVD audio & video performance of Lowell George era Little Feat in my collection pleases me to no end. Just the glazed-eyed look on Lowell's face as he plays slide on Tripe Face Boogie is worth the money,1006387200,2,253,4.08
1083209,4,6305841675,"There is no question that the sound and vision on this DVD release is below average.  ""Two Against Nature"" it ain't. However, if, like me, you regard Bruce Hornsby as one of the finest composers and performers in any idiom of the past 25 years, you will enjoy this DVD for what it is: a record of a great band at the peak of its powers.  The concert was recorded in Koln, Germany sometime after the release of ""A Night on the Town"".  The majority of the songs are taken from that recording.  Koln, of course, was the setting for a famous Keith Jarrett release on ECM. Horsnby dedicates ""Another Day"" to Leon Russell.  And that about sums things up: a cross between ""Leon Live"" and ""The Sun Bear Concerts"", with a dash of bluegrass and country for good measure.  Forget the audio quality (which is tolerable rather than execrable) and enjoy 90 minutes of superb music, beautifully crafted and flawlessly played.",1001462400,7,910,4.58641975308642
1083210,5,6305841675,"Filmed in Germany this incarnation of the band is the most well known with Lowell, Paul, Bill, Kenny, Sam and Richie. The concert footage is quite good considering it was done in the 70's and is live. It's a real kick to see how the guys looked in the 70's.
The best part for me was the voice over option which has Paul, Bill and ocassionally Lowell's wife talking over the entire concert. The value of DVD technology is really clear here. You hear the guys talk about the songs, what they were thinking the impact it all had on them and how the band has changed. Feat Fans, you'll love this.",1000771200,,592,4.294642857142857
1083211,4,6305841675,"Some people may see there's nothing like a Grateful Dead Concert. But for me there is nothing quite as captivating as seeing Little Feat. These guys add so many delectable colorings that its a true pleasure for repeated listenings. Watching Billy Payne and Paul Barrere trade piano and guitar riffs at the beginning of Dixie Chicken is pure heaven. A Day At The Dog Races and Feats Don't Fail Me Now are other highlights as the band really smokes with spirit. Some of the picture content is questionable(where was the camera when Sam Clayton had his cameo vocal on Old Folks Boogie). Its quite interesting hearing so much of Ritchie Hayward on background vocals. At times due to the sound, it sounds like he's the lead vocalist. Some people may be bothered by this but I like Ritchie's harmony vocals and of course his superb drumming.
Anyway, its been a long time comming that is the wait for this video. Lowell George was a very inspirational musician and its great that this video is finally available to the public through its proper channels.

1083212,4,6305841675,"I located this video via Amazon pages, so thank you. Having been a fan of the band for years and, I think, having all thier music on disc,tape or c.d., I was delighted to have a chance to ""see"" them again on Tape. The reviews already on line cover various views of the content and I would agree that watching this makes you realise just how good this band was and, conversly, how poor several of the current crop are. I first saw Little Feat in London in the early 1970's and was completely blown away by the sheer drive and raw edge to Lowell's performence. He was more than ably supported by the band - particularly Bills piano/vocals and Paul and Kenny's sheer rhythm. To a degree this energy is missing from this recording. Lowell takes just too much of a back seat and, while I acknowledge the others perform superbly -(Bill particularly), I couldn't help longing for the Dixie Chicken days of the younger George, the less extravegant solos by the band and the feel that the band was thier because they wanted to perform rather than simply taking on ""one more gig"". That having said,as the only Little Feat video I could locate, it is a good buy and reminds me just how good they were. If anyone knows of any other available Feet videos please provide the details.

1083214,5,6305841675,"I've seen many Rockpalast concerts on TV during the seventies and early eighties, but there are only two that I remember clearly and obviously this is one of them. What a great performance! A unique melt of (country)rock, funk and New Orleans jazz played so loose, but still so disciplined. This concert clearly shows that Litte Feat was Lowell George. Sometimes he steps back graciously in favour of Paul Barere or Bill Pain, but then the bloodrunning tension is immediately gone. Apart from that no weak moment, only highlights with 'Willin' as the absolute winner. A unique document!",973123200,2,586,4.989795918367347

I followed Little Feat since 1973-74 when they played in the small clubs in Dallas like Gurtie's, and Armadillo World Hqrts in Austin, and watching  this DVD made me feel like I was there all over again. The quality of the  video is great (given the technology of the 70's), camera angles great, the  sound is enhanced mono (surround-sound), but nevertheless teriffic.

7896280,4,6305841675,"Among the many tragedies of Lowell George's premature death is the very small amount of archival Little Feat video available of him with the band...I still can't believe that there wasn't film shot of any of the ""Waiting For Columbus"" concerts; what a missed opportunity. This DVD is from a July 23, 1977 German television concert program, and is the best overall concert video of George with Feat; sadly it is out of print and quite expensive, although totally worth the cost.

The primary reason I gave the DVD four stars instead of five was due to some technical issues in the concert and filming (feedback, color balance, etc.) rather than the performance itself, although I think the harmony parts on several of the songs are tighter on ""Waiting For Columbus"". Still that's an apples-to-oranges type of comparison, as the Rockpalast recording was not given anything like the postproduction attention that ""Waiting For Columbus"" received.

I thought the band was in great form for this concert, especially George and Richie Hayward, who is one of the greatest drummers in rock history. I also loved the dueling keyboard and guitar courtesy of Bill Payne and Paul Barrere, who were on top of their game for the show. Kenny Gradney's bass work, as always, provides a great foundation for the songs, along with the percussion of Hayward and Sam Clayton.

The song selection was what you would expect from the era and included:

Skin it Back
Fat Man in the Bathtub
Oh Atlanta
Day at the Dog Races
All That You Dream
Old Folks Boogie
Dixie Chicken
Tripe Face Boogie
Feats Don't Fail Me Now
Willin'
Rocket in My Pocket

and a special bonus track of ""Cold, Cold, Cold"".

For me the greatest performances are at the end of the set, with ""Feats Don't Fail Me Now"" all the way through the encore and ""Rocket in My Pocket"" showing the band at it's peak. I love ""Fat Man in the Bathtub"" and ""Dixie Chicken"" as well, but the versions on ""Waiting For Columbus"" are so good that I still prefer them. I loved the bonus of ""Cold, Cold, Cold"", and wish we could get a DVD with the entire show from which it was taken.

Overall, this is the best Little Feat performance with Lowell George available. It's not technically perfect, but it is still an absolute delight and I recommend paying the steep price to get your own copy!",1254528000,5,2311,4.6495098039215685
7896281,4,6305841675,"I'll say right off I've not seen the commercially released version of this show but I have seen copies that are in grey market circulation and it's a good example of the Feat with Lowell George. Apparently the commercial version is fairly similar to the bootleg copies floating around based on some other reviews posted here. If you're a fan of early Feat then this is a show worth owning, HOWEVER...these idiots that have it posted for $200+ are just that...idiots. I don't condone bootlegging but in this case I'd certainly invest a little time into tracking down a copy rather than pay the inflated and ridiculous prices being asked for by the sellers here.",1242000000,,660,4.747826086956522
7896282,5,6305841675,"Was this concert done in VIRGINIA or KOLN GERMANY?  The video says Koln Germany and the writing on the video back cover says Virginia as well as the official review up above.  Does it really matter?  I think it was done in Koln, Germany.  Look and listen for clues.

THE BAD: Picture quality is poor but not always poor, low & weird lighting & colors that change from minute to minute, sound okay but not superb.

THE GOOD: The performance is great!  My gosh, here you have Virginia's prince Bruce still in his 30s giving a great performance.  What more do you want?  Sometimes you do get really good clear closeups (the lighting doesn't change for the better, however) and on some rare occasion clear images of his hands on the keyboard where his natural skin tone and veins are visible.  What I REALLY LIKED is the REALLY GOOD angle shots of him going at the piano keyboard (close but not TOO close) where I could really relish watching him play the piano and see him really go at that keyboard like I've never seen him before-especially when he played ""Another Day.""  That's what I really appreciated.

THE AWESOME:  ANOTHER DAY as encore!!  Bruce is really great in this one.  He and the band made this a masterpiece performance.  I only wish the guitarist wasn't so blase and would have put some enthusiasm in this one fabulous rendition.  (I had only listened to ""A Night On the Town"" once during last weekend)--This is what happened:  I was so impressed by ""Another Day"" as it was performed on the DVD that I rushed to the library first thing Saturday morning (my sleep-in morning) to get on the internet to check out the album with this song.  After becoming desperate when I couldn't find it (naturally the CD I just got was the last one I checked), I finally found it in the album ""A Night On the Town"" that I just received last weekend (DUH!!!) AND already listened to the weekend before--only once over & not giving it my full attention.  I didn't realize I had it at home already!!  The performance on the DVD is great, but the music, although not exactly the same because he improvises during live performances, is comparable in quality with the one in the CD with only minor differences.  Turn it up a notch.  I just love it.  However, Bruce does seem to do lots of his best work when he lets loose on stage in live performances & this is another example.

You should really be prepared to see poor quality pictures (but they are not poor all of the time) and a truly great performance by Bruce and band.  See it in this sort of way:  There is only one train to Kathmandu--purchase your ticket and don't complain.  If you want to see Bruce & Band perform in 1990, get this video.  As I see it, there are not a whole lot of videos out there of Bruce while in his 30's performing live.  I thought it was worthwhile despite the image quality.  In any one video you get something and you lose something.  Here you get Bruce and Band in an intimate and good performance, plus in some occasion you get to see him really play the piano.  I loved that.",1219017600,,3059,4.415026833631485
7896283,2,6305841675,"For a concert DVD, I can accept average video, but the audio still has to be listenable. I watched this with headphones on and it gets painful on many of the songs - it sounds like someone left the master tape sitting in the rain before they transfered this to DVD. It fluctuates so bad at times you can't even hear much of anything.",1203811200,,333,4.21875
7896284,2,6305841675,"Many reviewers of Little Feat video products have lauded this as the best Feat video on the market. So, if only by process of elimination, I'd have to agree. But that ain't saying much. Just click over to my review of Little Feat's ""High Wire Act"" DVD and you'll see what I mean.

Compared to what Little Feat accomplished in the post Lowell George era, I think this performance at ""Rockpalast"" (German for Rock Palace) is somewhat sub par..... So string me up, burn me at the stake and send me to a vivisectionist for blasphemy. But, the video resolution is so deplorable at times that you hardly see what you're watching. The sound mix and quality are equally stinky.....

For example, I love Richey Hayward. he is Little Feat's answer to Keith Moon. His ""all over the kit ...lead drumming"" style always fits the songs perfectly....  And Richey's ability to simultaneously sing the ""high 5"" harmony part is nothing short of the miraculous. But the audio has him mixed three times louder than the lead vocal... You can barely hear Lowell George sing at all. That's just ""sound man stupidity"". In addition, Lowell's guitar is equally as absent in the mix.... The sound people should be sent to prison for effing up the only real ""Lowell George era"" Feat video we have.... Bummer eh?

Besides that, I believe the band had serious chemistry problems in those years, both personal and pharmacological... It made for a less than acceptable product....

If you want the best Little Feat concert available anywhere... It's from Feat's Craig Fuller era. Call PBS and Terry Likona at Austin City Limits and DEMAND that they release the Little Feat concert that they have on file. This performance is so clean, you (personally) could lick any portion of it without fear of septic contamination.

But as for this ""Rockpalast"" concert, I'm giving this 3 stars because it's the only thing on video featuring Lowell George and Little Feat.... No..... in fact, I just changed my mind... 2 stars and that's it.... The music was probably OK, but who knows....?...you can't really hear much of it... It's Little Feat successfully concealed behind a wall of musical mush.

True, average music fans wouldn't know good sound if it ran them down in the street.... fans simply have tin ears. This fact is  substantiated by the popularity of no talent morons like Madonna and Justin (frickin') Timberlake. Hell, If ""Micah"" Jackson walked onstage and threw up... the fans would fall weeping at his feet in undying admiration... Fans just don't know any better.

Having said that... if you're thinking of buying the DVD version of this concert for $200...... think again, friend.
