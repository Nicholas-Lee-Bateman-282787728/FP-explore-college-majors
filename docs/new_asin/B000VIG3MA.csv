8218846,3,B000VIG3MA,"I lived at this commune called ""The Brotherhood of the Spirit"" and it was neither a brotherhood nor a spiritual for myself but a police state and there was a fanatical cult attitude that permeated this commune. After viewing this film 4 times I had to accept that the six weeks which I stayed there were a blur in my memory bank. I was biased because at the age age of 16 in the summer of 1973 I just wanted to have fun and travel. The film filled in holes for me in terms of why I was followed and caught every time I tried to hook up with a certain girl who seemed equally perplexed at the police state attitude towards our attempts to engage in consensual sex, there was a hypocritical ethic, sex for their ""God"" i.e. Michael Metalica, sex for the members whom defined what ""being in love"" was ( which is like defining the meaning of life) and their voyeurism in jumping out of their SUV vehicles at the time of their subjects (servants) orgasms! . The ""Laws"" of the commune were agreed upon by the founding members but for a young soul there was nothing free about them. Being there honestly sucked and seeing this film explained why. If a member worked at any job they were required to give all of their income to ""the commune"" but if a member actually needed shelter they were worked at farms for an 18 hour day. I was one of the latter. I joined the commune with a fellow hitchhiker who was AWOL from the Army. I guess I can't say that I ""joined"" but more accurately I was on trial. The poor soul who was AWOL dissipated into oblivion & it was irresponsible to bring him to a ""Free Spiritual Commune"" but this is another hypocritical issue affecting an attempt at one's own utopia. One persons happiness is another persons hell any way one can look at it. After 6 weeks I was driven to the center of Westsfield Massachusetts and after being verbally abused I was thrown out of their vehicle. Believe what you need to believe although this experience for myself was not at all an experience of good karma nor was it a place of higher learning i.e. Buddhists & expanded theological thought but it was a cult that worshiped a human who I was told demanded to be treated as God itself. So after being tossed out I hitchhiked to an opposite environment and a true commune where upon arriving I was handed a joint and told I could build a house & live on the land which was owned by Ken Kesey & that commune was ""Earth People's Park"" in Norton Vermont. Since I was at the ""Brotherhood of the Spirit"" for only 6 weeks in August of 1973 my writing is again biased and limited but I can honestly say that the film is actually informative. Although it may not be a Hollywood production it is informative. For myself, this documentary explained a lot but for a film in general I can't see this being enjoyed in theaters. It could have been a big budget film with actors playing the roles, big sets and a fictional narrative but it was honest with multiple examples of film and video, some crude and other scenes viewable.",1369008000,3,3017,4.351063829787234
8218847,3,B000VIG3MA,"We are interested in the subject so we enjoyed watching it.  The whole cult mentality and how everybody can give their money to a guy to buy himself a Rolls Royce fascinates me.  Of all the hippie commune/cults to be in, this one, honestly, didn't seem to be as much fun.  They didn't party, except for the leader. ha,ha. But this is an interesting and unique, honest look at this one particular commune.  The people whom I bought it from on Amazon sent a nice note and it is was a quality product.",1355443200,2,498,4.32258064516129
8218848,5,B000VIG3MA,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this documentary..I live in the North Quabbin region and I can remember seeing Rapunzel when he would come into the local establishments this would have been in the later years. I bought this as a Christmas present for my father who remembered the commune and how locals would yell and chase the ""kids"" off when they came into town.  Looking back he can see that they meant no harm.",1295654400,2,412,4.6438356164383565
8218849,5,B000VIG3MA,"I own this commune's original music LP and was considering joining such a community as it appears to be a free and happy life.

This film diminishes the stereotype that your typical commune is full of drugging, smoking, drinking and sexual activity.

From this footage you learn that are disadvantages to such a lifestyle such as overcrowdedness, resentment from neighbors and town officials, malnutrition, and running out of money to fufill all needs of a growing membership.",1211673600,3,476,5.1688311688311686
8218850,5,B000VIG3MA,A consummate example of what a documentary should be. It is an amazing true story of a single man's idea that in time flourished into a society. Not only is this film intriguing and enlightening but Free Spirits left a lastly desire to know more about those in the Commune and the ideals they so heavily believed in.,1195344000,4,316,4.4655172413793105
8218851,5,B000VIG3MA,"Free Spirits is interesting and thrilling. 400 young adults coming together to fufill their dreams in a healthy spiritual way. Free Spirits is entertaining and educational, while learning about the life in communes and Michael Metalica, the viewer can also see the hopes and dreams that were achieved during the commune years, giving hope to younger generations that their dreams really can come true with the help of others.",1191456000,4,425,5.173913043478261
8218852,5,B000VIG3MA,"This film is like a Biography, only not of a person but of an experiment in living.  As such it contains all the drama and conflict, dreams and aspirations, and humor and tragedy you might expect from a long-lived experiment in which strong personalities live, work, and play together outside but alongside the mainstream during the tumultuous changes in American culture from the 1960s through the 1970s and into the 1980s.  In a lot of interesting ways the conflicts and changes experienced within the Brotherhood of the Spirit/Renaissance Commune echo broader changes in American society; these include changing ideas of collective living, rebelling, leadership, gender relations, parenting, and even capitalism.  This story is really the story of recent American history offered in an unusual and fascinating crucible.",1190678400,3,822,5.456692913385827
8218853,5,B000VIG3MA,"Free Spirits is a unique and vivid documentary which chronicles the rise and fall of the Brotherhood of the Spirit/Renaissance Commune and its eclectic mix of members.  Michael Metellica Rapunzel (the charismatic young man who was the founding force of the commune) proves a fascinating character, at once shocking, pitiable, and disturbingly compelling. I used the film in a sociology term paper on total institutions and found it extremely useful.  Great soundtrack.",1190419200,4,468,5.486111111111111
8218854,5,B000VIG3MA,"If you REALLY want to get a lesson in communal living beyond the usual stereotypes, this is the film. Also a Shakespearian lesson in the attraction and abuses of power and how easy it is to fall under its spell.
This was not your typical commune and this not your typical tale. Worth checking out!",1189123200,4,297,4.418181818181818
8218855,4,B000VIG3MA,"I really enjoyed this story about one of the more successful communal living experiments initiated in the late 60's and that still survives. The depiction of the rise and fall of the main character is fascinating. The first-hand accounts from former and current members and other advocates and detractors are well done plus the film includes lots of original footage from the period. The original soundtrack is good too. I highly recommend the film, especially to anyone interested in experiencing (or re-experiencing) the adventure, drama and idealism of that time.",1188604800,6,566,5.3
