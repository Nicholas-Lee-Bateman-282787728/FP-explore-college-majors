8131556,5,B000GFMBII,My kids love this movie.  They are on their second copy because they watched it so much that they wore the first one out.  It is also a great movie to show at church for children's events.  It has a great message about trusting in God and not letter fear run our lives.,1412553600,,269,4.037735849056604
8131557,5,B000GFMBII,"I really like this movie; I can watch it with my sons and know that there are no curse words or anything that would harm them.  It teaches us how to face fear by using the verse ""God has not giving us spirit of fear""",1375747200,,216,3.8
8131558,1,B000GFMBII,"We buy low budget movies because for the most part they are the best in morals. This one was even too cheesy for us.

Besides the spy theme of it the second theme was boyfriend/girlfriend type stuff (we don't do). The main girl character also has a few scenes when she's in a low cut shirt with a slit in between the breasts that is closed up with a string. You can see much cleavage (my guys had to turn their heads)

Description on the back of the movie case says, ""delicately laced with scripture."" WHATEVER! It has one verse that they use through out the whole movie. That is the ONLY scripture they use. They could have found more verses on fear and used them.

I would not buy this movie!",1359763200,,694,4.242424242424242
8131559,5,B000GFMBII,"This film is good because it is so bad, but gives a good message.
Up there with attack of the killer tomatos.

The script really need work, spy hq is a janators closet at a Hi way rest stop.
A bomb is placed at HQ all thow it is impossible to  and no one is hurt.  The room is hardly damaged, should have blow the room to bits and a hole threw the wall.
A scripture verse is repaatly said threw the film which really didn't need to be done. Repeating it three time would have got the message across fine.

Get this film, get your friends over and have a good laugh.
Wouldn't be surprised if this gets a cult following",1344816000,,617,4.032786885245901
8131560,2,B000GFMBII,"This movie is a strange B movie with pretty badly done special effects
and a very preachy Christian script.
Since one wonders what Jesus might think of his teaching being used
to give a young female spy courage, I have to give this bad marks.
The acting in most cases is just a little short of Hollywood,
but mostly like an local playhouse stage production.
I think they should get some credit for at least trying
to get Christian ideals and concepts before a modern audience,
but a lot less for ideologically  shrewing up badly?",1260057600,,529,4.568421052631579
8131561,3,B000GFMBII,"Spykids is a movie made new film makers.  A little long at time.  Great plot.  Fun for boys as an action film.  It is definitely elementary aged. Enjoyed that they didn't have a budget for special effects and improvised.  We were having a good time with it because it is silly at times and liked overcoming fears as a theme.  Not what expected because our house has teenagers, this is a children's film.",1255219200,2,403,4.4520547945205475
8131562,3,B000GFMBII,"I read some very positive reviews of this film and so purchased it for my family.  I'm not sure where those great reviews came from (from a site other than Amazon I think, not sure now) but this film was pretty low-budget and cheesy.

I do give them props for making the film, and the part of the story about the mother trying to help her daughter overcome fear I thought was excellent, but due to the production quality this movie is in our list of possibly the worst 2 movies we've every seen.

So if you want to watch some high school-aged spies stop a man from blowing up the town, and with Christian themes, it's okay, but definitely not a Hollywood quality production.  If, however, you need a film to help talk about how to handle fear from a Biblical perspective (for your teens) this might be a good conversation starter.",1253318400,,830,4.405228758169935
8131563,5,B000GFMBII,"RSTC is possibly one of the most unique films for kids I have seen in a long time.  It's not preachy but you can't watch the movie without taking the scripture out of it.  A lot of Christian films for kids will have a scriptural principle that is taught, and then at the end maybe they'll teach the verse it came from.  RSTC is different: you watch Liz go through a trying experience and the only way she can get through it is to use the scripture that is taught in the movie.  I have several friends whose kids have watched this movie over and over again, and they love it every time.  And I can't help but think that when they get into a situation where they are afraid, they'll know that ""God has not given me a spirit of fear!""",1156636800,6,731,4.119718309859155
8131564,5,B000GFMBII,"Having grown up as a preacher's daughter, and having watched christian movies my entire life, I am excited there is a blockbuster quality movie that will still teach the important lesson of I Timothy 1:7 to all ages.  Without being too ""preachy"" it gives kids hip role models to look up to.  I wish this movie had been out when I was younger.  It would have been cool to think that there is a secret society that is out there that I could join as a christian young person. I am sure in my younger years I would have been much more excited to go to church after seeing this movie!  RSTC has the excitement of ""Spy Kids"" with the morals of ""Veggie Tales"".  I have bought a copy for all my nieces and nephews and a copy for my husband and myself.  Forget all your ideas on christian movies and WATCH THIS FILM!!",1153440000,9,808,4.214285714285714
