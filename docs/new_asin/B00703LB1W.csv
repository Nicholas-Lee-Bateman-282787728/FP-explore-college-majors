8507521,4,B00703LB1W,"Oz Vessalius is the privileged son of one of the four Great Dukes and heir to his father's title. He leads an idyllic life with his little sister and best friend/servant, Gilbert. But on his 15th birthday, during his Coming of Age Ceremony, he is attacked by a strange group of people who throw him into a different dimension, a dark prison known as the Abyss. There he meets Alice, a strange girl with the power to turn into a large black rabbit with great strength. After she saves him from a creature called a Chain, he agrees to enter a contract with her in order to return to his world.

The story of Pandora Hearts is engaging and intriguing. The plot moves along quickly and has many mysteries to explore. But a good plot isn't enough, good characters are also important. And this is where Pandora Hearts surprised me the most - it had good characters. Oz is perhaps one of the most interesting characters I've seen in anime. He seems to be pretty average at first - spoiled and a bit of a bully, but really a nice guy. Then the traumatic past is introduced and it is suggested that his sunny personality is just a mask for the darkness within. But low and behold, Oz actually listens to people who criticize his character and he is able to see his own flaws. Then, miracles of miracles, he actually tries to address those flaws. Oz's character development is primarily wrought through his own action, not though other characters shaping him, as so many other character developments normally go. I found it an extremely interesting and refreshing change.

The art for the series is beautiful and detailed. But I had a hard time appreciating it though the terrible video quality of the DVDs. When I first started watching, within minutes I paused it to do some research online to find out why it looked so terrible (and when I say terrible, I say it as someone who rarely notices video quality). It isn't a problem specific to my set, as far as I could tell, the problem had to do with the brightness being turned way up. If the scene was light enough you couldn't really tell, but as soon as it got black everything went pixlated. It was terrible, but I got used to it eventually.

I really liked this series. Even with the horrible video quality, I don't regret buying the sets. However, there is one thing you should be warned of before diving in - it doesn't end. The manga (which I have not read) is currently at 17 volumes in Japan and is still ongoing. It is being published here in the US and is at 10 volumes right now, with 4 more scheduled for release. I didn't know this until after I watched the last episode and was like ""What the h*** happened to the answers?"" There is no second season. The anime ends with most of the big mysteries unexplained. I still recommend this show, but know what you are getting into.

About the DVDs: Audio is Japanese only, English subtitles. Extras include several Omake episodes and clean opening and ending. The only difference between the Standard and the Premium is that the latter comes with a 32 page hardcover art book. This set comes with 2 DVDs and 13 episodes, while the second set contains the last 12 episodes of the series.

UPDATE 5/14: It was recently announced that the manga would be ending with volume 23. It is very unlikely that the anime would ever be continued, but at least the end of the story will be available if you are so inclined.",1338336000,9,3410,4.47588424437299
