1746632,4,B00006FDAM,"If you enjoy Tim Conway, you'll love this story.  A dog teaches and guides him through his adventures and they become best friends as he learns that the dog is smarter than he is.  Cute, funny, and heartwarming.  You'll be rooting them on to overcome all of the obstacles.  Great DVD....",1273881600,,287,4.568627450980392
1746633,3,B00006FDAM,"I originally saw this movie as a kid, and hadn't seen it since the 70's. So, I bought it when I saw it up for grabs on ebay. As an adult I have to say that it is really sad that they didn't just make it a train movie! I am a train and hobo buff and this had the making of a great train movie. Tim Conway is funny enough, but why did they side-track this movie by introducing a dog kidnapping in the middle? This, in my opinion, gutted the movie. It was supposed to be a movie about a bungling oaf, who has to make it as a hobo in order to get his new found inheritence. Instead, they just throw in a couple of railroad scenes, and the whole movie is really about Tim Conway getting wrapped up in a dog-kidnapping scheme, and how he gets away from the bad guys. I was disappointed. I believe that they must have ran into a snag, either with getting cooperation from various railroads in the 70's, or had technical difficulties, and were forced to change the plot. I can only imagine how great this movie could have been, if they were able to actually make a real hobo movie out of it. The dog is pretty good, and obviously well trained. If you want to see a good train movie about hobo's, get emporer of the north.",1266537600,,1213,4.079497907949791
1746634,4,B00006FDAM,"Tim Conway is just a funny man. The only thing that could make this movie better is being longer and more cut ups from Tim. There are some areas that are a bit slow, but all in all, the kids (and us grown-up kids who like Conway) will enjoy it.",1252972800,,244,3.9
1746635,1,B00006FDAM,"This movie is so frustrating! It is slap stick comedy to the extreme, and is just so frustrating, that you can't really enjoy it.",1222214400,,129,4.416666666666667
