8621439,5,B00G9FQ734,Loved using these to teach kindergarten and first grade students. 13 years teaching experience. I know quality material and this is it.,1479254400,,135,5.181818181818182
8621440,4,B00G9FQ734,"Pictures of the actual item or action words being featured would make this DVD better, but I believe it will serve the purpose of helping my grandson sound out words and that's all I was looking for. The visuals are of a woman moving to the music and doing some charade-like movements to go with the words featured within a box in the upper left corner of the screen.",1478390400,,367,4.333333333333333

8621442,3,B00G9FQ734,"Compared to the volume 1 sight words and classroom management dvd (new version with cartoon and other adults), this dvd is very boring.  The word families all have the same tune whereas the other two DVDs each have different catchy tunes (even my youngest 15mo old is trying to mimic moves) but not for this one. This is the third one I'm investing in for my own kids prekg and kg age.  Its good if you turn it on for specific word families but not to play straight through (which I do for the other 2 and my kids never get bored).  So I just got it and have not had a chance to see how helpful it is yet.  I will edit again in a couple of months.",1452729600,,647,3.992248062015504

8621446,5,B00G9FQ734,"Great addition to our homeschool day!
A fun way to add motion, expand energy, increase co ordination and learn kinetically - all great things for an active boy learning his phonics.  We try to do as little seat work as possible.  I am always looking for ways to learn actively and reduce paperwork/workbooks.  This fits the bill beautifully.
I like that I could see the videos on you tube before I bought them via amazon.  I showed them to my son and he enjoyed them so we ordered.  I will tell him to do 15 minutes of dancing phonics and he goes to it.  Easily something he can do independently but I can join him for some aerobics! :-)  I like that the letters are on the screen as well as being spoken and that he is dancing, singing, hearing and seeing all at once.  Not only do they help burn energy but he is indeed learning his phonics while having fun.
We do these videos on a frequent basis - several days a week at least.
Highly recommend.
All of the youtube videos show it being used in a classroom setting but works great at home for fun, exercise and learning!",1396742400,2,1073,4.2772277227722775
