8323558,4,B0009OJ9FO,"Stuart Bull is one of the big 3 lick library has in its camp of teachers the others being Danny Gill, Jammie Huphries. He has a great technique to his teaching method and explains very well the scales used and the actual fret numbers called out during solo playalong. The types of blues numbers covered are very good and consist of vairing tempos and key change examples. This is a good dvd to buy for those looking to expand their knowledge of soloing and rythym playing in the blues style. Great camera angles and crisp audio are earmarks of lick librarys proffesinal filmed instructinal dvd's. They are simply the best out there right now for begginers right through intermediate.

and this dvd won't disapoint. Also of mention is the great backers you get to play along to as well that are the very same used in the lessons. Quality top shelf through and through.
