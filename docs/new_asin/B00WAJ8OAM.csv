8712601,5,B00WAJ8OAM,"This Kaboom! edition of PAW Patrol contains a slightly different episode listing than the Nickelodeon (U.S.) version. Included episodes are:
Pups Make a Splash
Pups and the Very Big Baby
Pups in a Fog
Pup Pup Goose
Pup, Pup and Away
Pup a Doodle Do

While the Nickelodeon version of this DVD contains 10 episodes and the Kaboom! version only 6 episodes, the Nickelodeon version does NOT include ""Pups make a Splash"", which was the very first episode of PAW Patrol to air on television! (Nickelodeon did, however, include ""Pups Make a Splash"" on their 4th PAW Patrol DVD, ""Meet Everest""). However, it is also worth noting that even though the Kaboom! PAW Patrol DVDs only include 6 episodes each, they have released the entire first season of PAW Patrol over the course of their 8 DVDs, so anyone looking to buy the entire first season is better off getting the Kaboom! DVD series, as opposed to the Nickelodeon DVDs, which only released some season 1 episodes over the course of their first 3 PAW Patrol DVDs, and then just started randomly releasing a mix of various seasons 1, 2 and 3 episodes on their more recent DVD releases. I'm hopeful that Kaboom! will now release all of season 2 over the course of their next 8 PAW Patrol DVD releases.",1475366400,,1245,4.633484162895928
