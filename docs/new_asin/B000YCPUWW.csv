3025976,5,B000YCPUWW,"Harrison Ford and Clint Eastwood together on one disc.  It doesn't get any better than this.  In Air Force One, Ford plays the current U.S. President and former fighter jock.  He is aboard Air Force One when it is taken over by terrorists.  Ford comes to the rescue and saves the day of course.  This is a very good action film and sure to keep one on the edge of one's seat.  In the second film, In The Line of Fire, Eastwood plays a burned out Secret Services agent who once again gets the opportunity to save the president.  John Malchovich does his usual excellent job as the villain in this film.  Again, this film is sure to keep viewers on the edge of their seat.  These are two excellent action films starring two legendary movie heroes that are more than worth the price.",1329955200,7,780,4.361111111111111
