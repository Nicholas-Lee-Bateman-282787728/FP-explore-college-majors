8104603,5,B000E33FUK,"Coach Schembechler's charges secure the first bowl victory of his already stellar coaching career.
This is the complete telecast with pregame and a brief postgame. There is no halftime. And all is presented without commercial interruption. This is an excellent quality dvd. Made even more impressive when you keep in mind that you are viewing a JANUARY 1, 1981, telecast.",1485734400,,371,5.2
8104604,5,B000E33FUK,"This is another great college football release from The Computer Group: the 1981 Rose Bowl between Michigan and Washington. Like the 1982 Orange Bowl that would follow it, this '81 Rose Bowl was from NBC, and as such, had excellent coverage and graphics. After the two coaches (Bo Schembechler for Michigan and Don James for Washington) are shown, NBC's 11-feathered peacock is formed as follows: a series of 12 straight lines (with 11 spaces between them) emerges from the bottom of the screen to form a clear peacock, and at the same time, the colors of the peacock make their way between these lines and fill in the outlines of the feathers, and then the peacock's body comes up from the bottom of the bird and assumes its place in the middle as the lines retract. The peacock then glows as ""NBC Sports"" in ITC Serif Gothic appears, and at the same time, a red and blue neon ""N"" appears behind the peacock. Another thing to like about this '81 Rose Bowl is that the screen was not slathered in graphics like a lot of today's bowl broadcasts are now; there was only a down and distance graphic and a score graphic (both used for updates only), and the occasional stat graphic, not to mention the excellent starting lineup segments.

Besides the difference between then and now of the Rose Bowl's presentation, there is another glaring difference: the Rose Bowl then was not part of the infamous Bowl Championship Series (which, as you may recall, didn't even exist then, let alone a Bowl Alliance or any other infamous arrangement or system); it was just straight-up college bowl action, as were all the bowls (Orange, Fiesta, Sugar, Cotton, etc.).

One more is that then, we didn't have the obnoxious game announcers that ESPN and FOX have now; it was then Dick Enberg and the late Merlin Olsen (who were also known as two of the best of NBC's NFL announcers as well).

All that considered, I'm strongly recommending this release of the '81 Rose Bowl for purchase if you want to see straight-up football presented in an equally straight-up manner on NBC without the annoying graphics or the Bowl Championship Series.",1316736000,,2119,4.721621621621622
8104605,5,B000E33FUK,"This DVD is well worth it because it was legendary Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler's first Rowe Bowl victory and one of the best teams he ever had at Michigan led by the dynamic Anthony Carter.

Washington dominated the game early, and on its second drive, the Huskies reached the Michigan one-yard line. But the Wolverines then stonewalled tailback Toussiant Tyler on fourth down and took the momentum from Washington. Butch Woolfolk put Michigan in the lead with a six-yard TD burst near the half, and despite Chuck Nelson's two field goals, the Wolverines remained in command the rest of the way.

Ali Haji-Sheikh's 25-yard field goal capped a six- minute, 83-yard drive to open the second half, and John Wangler connected with Anthony Carter for a seven-yard score, widening the Michigan margin to 17-6 with three minutes remaining in the third quarter. From there, the Wolverine defense took over with Keith Bostic forcing an interception and limiting the Huskies to 23 yards in total offense until the game's final minutes. Michigan clinched the victory on Stan Edwards' (Father of UM Wide receiver and now Cleveland Brown, Braylon Edwards) one-yard TD dive with four minutes remaining in the game to provide the final margin.
