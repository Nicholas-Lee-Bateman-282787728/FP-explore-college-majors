1422224,1,B00005BGQE,"There really should be an option to give a movie zero stars, because this movie deserves it.  There are literally no redeeming qualities.  The film was supposedly made in 1992, but the picture quality looks more like 1972.  The box cover shows Steve Buscemi, but he's only in it for about 30 seconds (and doesn't look anything like he does on the box cover).  The box cover also shows Sandra Bullock, but she's only in it for about 3 minutes (and she, too, doesn't look anything like she does on the box cover).  She did what has to be one of (if not the) worst sex scenes in film history.  I would be extremely surprised if she wasn't embarrassed and ashamed at having done this film.

The film is extremely boring.  I turned it off after 45 minutes and came back to it a few days later, forcing myself (against my better judgment) to watch it, partly out of some morbid curiosity, and partly because I had the notion that it had to get better.  Unfortunately, it didn't.  When it was over, I cursed myself for buying it simply because it claimed to star Sandra Bullock and Steve Buscemi.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.  Even at 4.99, it's a waste of movie.  I've never gotten rid of a CD or DVD after I purchased it, but I just may change with this purchase.",1201910400,16,1284,4.322175732217573
1422225,2,B00005BGQE,"Okay, this is a really bad movie.  That said, there are some moments here that are so over-the-top bad that they're funny.  The fake accents are so horrible that they become campy and the now notorious love scene involving Sandra Bullock is outright hilarious...and very embarassing.  How she could be making love without removing a single garment is a mystery, but the acting in that scene is ridiculous, as well.  However, it is certainly memorable.  Sandra Bullock shows up for another short scene later in the film, but her role is essentially a throw away part.  Then there is the sudden appearance of notable actor Steve Buscemi at the very beginning of the film in which he seems almost ashamed to be in.  His character never returns to the story after that.  By the end of the film there are so many plot twists that heartfelt boredom ensues.  The acting is bad, the budget is obviously low, and the script, which invokes the occasional giggle, is a quivering mass of bulbous drivel.  Avoid this film.",1095206400,,1009,4.714285714285714
1422226,1,B00005BGQE,"This film has to be seen to be believed. It's so bad, it's funny. You've got a bunch of guys prancing around, sticking their chests out, thinking their big hard guys, and then they open their mouths, and horror of horrors, out comes these incredible phoney, gangster accents.
And worst of all is Sandra Bullock. I hope none of the big Hollywood directors who have worked with her, decided to have her in their movie thanks to this. She's dreadful. Her hair is an immediate distraction, due to the severe HUGENESS of it. She must have gone through a couple of hairspray for this. But what's worse is the main scene she's in, is a sex scene. And it's bad. Really bad. Worse than the one in Fire On The Amazon. It's very over the top. Plus, what she does, would probably hurt the guy, as well as her! And she wears some very unflattering underwear, which do nothing for her skinny figure.
Overall this film is bad. Bad bad bad. I cannot stress this enough. Thank God Sandra began to star in some GOOD films, rather than this. What I want to know is who did she have to sleep with, to get to the big Hollywood A-list star she is today?",1078617600,6,1131,4.314553990610329

1422254,1,B00005BGQE,"Only watched it because Sandra bullock was in it. She only had 2 parts, and the first was sadly lame...Im sure she's sorry she played in this film.  It did have some funny parts, the ending could have been 10 times better. Its an old film, so I guess it is what it is.",1468195200,,268,3.962962962962963

1422257,4,B00005BGQE,"What can I say other than Sandra Bullock is in the movie. Surprising comedy, with alot of laughs. It also has Steve Buscemi which I have started to follow his movies. He is a excellent character actor and can play parts from serious to comedy without any problem. Enjoyable movie with these two actors that work quite well with each other.",1428451200,,339,4.573770491803279

1422259,5,B00005BGQE,"Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses.  She has the ability to make you laugh, cry, think, and especially feel emotions.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about her - she does not get enough credit for her acting talent.",1392336000,,233,4.658536585365853
1422260,4,B00005BGQE,The DVD arrived on time and as always Amazon handled everything perfectly.  I am extremely pleased with the service.  When I am looking for a DVD or CD I always know where to look and Amazon comes through.,1314230400,,205,4.368421052631579
1422261,1,B00005BGQE,"i watched this movie only because I like Sandra Bullock.  Not even Sandra Bullock in black underwear could save this movie, however.  As noted by the previous reviewer, Sandra's part in the movie lasted only about 3 minutes and the ""sex"" scene appeared unconvincing and had no point in the movie.  The movie is about an unsuccessful writer, whose manuscripts come from outlandish conspiracy plots fed to him by Steve Buscemi.  However, again, like the previous reviewer noted, if you go to the kitchen at the wrong time you will completely miss Buscemi's cameo appearance.  Frustrated, the writer joins his uncle who is in the mob, believing he can get first-hand material for a book.  He is arrested and made to ""wear a wire"" in an effort to get evidence on one of the head mob figures.  He is discovered, almost killed, and when he does get evidence the police are no longer interested because the task force investigating the mob has run out of funding.  The last scene has the potential to be funny, as the ""writer,"" his uncle, and another mobster are reduced to trying to cheat little old ladies at a church bingo game.  As they are beatn by the elderly bingo players, the scene is so poorly done, it even fails to be funny.",1244246400,4,1229,4.60091743119266

7937327,1,B00005BGQE,"Im writing this review in February 2018, and most of the ones I just read were dated in the mid to late aughts. I suspect theres a lesson for us to be gleaned from that observation.

To recap (apologies to the aforementioned reviewers) -
Flat characters. Ridiculous, but not in a campy, funny way, mobster accents. Plodding storyline that wasn't worth the 15 minutes I gave it; according to the other reviewers, I didn't miss much.",1517961600,,431,4.671052631578948
