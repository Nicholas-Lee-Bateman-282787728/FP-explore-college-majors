2827477,5,B000PMLJLW,": We love this show, these old TV shows make good family entertainment with enough action to be interesting but nothing offensive. It's great to be able to watch the whole series in the order it aired instead of episodes here and there.",1356739200,,236,4.511627906976744
2827478,5,B000PMLJLW,"Although I do not recall this series on Australian television I am pleased to add
it to my extensive collection of the period.
The episode titled ""The birth of the blade"" was an entertaining introduction, however
the fight Bowie has with the ""mother Bear"" comes across as a large cub.
I already possessed 6 episodes from the ""Ultimate TV Westerns"" set from Millcreek released the same year of 2007, this set has a better quality ....  and more complete....
this is a 10 DVD set  76 episodes  1956-1958
from : Infinity Enterprises
  Falcoln Picture Group
  SFN  Entertainment
A cardboard box with 10 cardboard sleeves each holding 1 DVD.
This type of packaging I have often come across and find inconvienient, as with the
release of Wagon Train I have gone to the trouble of re-packaging these.",1347926400,,793,4.779411764705882
2827479,5,B000PMLJLW,"Great, my family loved it and were surprised that I could find them anywhere. I waited a long time for them to go down in price because before it was over $100 then over $60 and now it is over $30! They run well",1346457600,,211,3.8181818181818183
2827480,5,B000PMLJLW,"This is a television series that knows no rival.  It is based on a novel by Monte Barrett titled the ""Tempered Blade"", a fact mixed with fiction account of the life of Jim Bowie.  Jim Bowie being the famous frontiersman who is most remembered for inventing the famous ""Bowie Knife.""  However, as both the novel and the series reveal, it turns out Bowie was quite an innovator and intelligent man.  Set primarily in 1830s Louisiana, this black and white series is replete with historical and charming vignettes concerning the life of Jim Bowie.  One learns how many of the streets in New Orleans were named, the origin of the word cocktail, details about how some Cajuns didn't want to believe the Louisiana Purchase had been made, and how the famous bird painter Audubon was once thought to be of royal ancestry.  The series is a clean one and actually appropriate for family viewing.  At the time of its initial airing in the fifties it was thought to be a little too violent for the young, but nowadays the fight scenes just seem clever.  Jim Bowie himself is portrayed by Scott Forbes, who lends the role a rare yet most appealing air of raw masculinity mixed with cultured sophistication.  For classic television buffs it is also interesting to see different actors in their early roles, such as Sam Houston being portrayed by the same actor who would later be Uncle Jesse on ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" series.  This DVD collection of ""The Adventures of Jim Bowie"" is especially exceptional because it is the complete series and features good sound quality.  Simply put, this show is one of the best ever produced and it is well worth the time and money.  One cannot help but be delighted with it.",1336262400,18,1697,4.6767676767676765
2827481,5,B000PMLJLW,"I wasn't sure if I should purchase the whole series of Jim Bowie. I had some episodes on VHS which I always liked, so I decided to splurge. I'm so glad I did. All the great memories of that time came back watching these. Sure the history isn't accurate, some cheap sets are used & some so-so acting is involved. But, Scott Forbes is such a likeable actor & I love the era & even the Ken Darby Singers ""Ooooing"" away in the background. This was a huge show among my childhood peers & I just can't help liking it. Some shows I don't care about cost or quality, I'm just grateful to have them in any condition. The quality of these DVD's are excellent. If you want good old American 1950's TV history, check out Jim Bowie. I sure wish they would release ""Yancy Derringer"", ""The Rebel"" & ""The Grey Ghost"" on DVD.",1239753600,17,808,4.253246753246753
2827482,4,B000PMLJLW,"This set includes the full two seasons of this series and the images and sound, while not perfect, are very good and better than the earlier DVD releases, one of which included only the first season and others that only contained a few episodes.  Forbes presents an appealing portrait of Bowie and is supported by a good cast.  The series only paid passing tribute to real history, but it was and still is a lot of fun.  And that knife -- the Iron Mistress itself, is still captivating.",1227657600,27,486,4.5
2827483,5,B000PMLJLW,I bought this series because I watched it as a child of the 50s.  It is great entertainment and the video quality of the dvds are just plain great.  Get it if you can.,1223769600,2,167,3.8823529411764706
2827484,3,B000PMLJLW,"The 76 half-hour episodes (in B&W) of the western ""The Adventures of Jim Bowie originally aired on ABC from 1956-1958.  This DVD contains the entire run of the series whose target audience was probably pre-teen boys.  Today it is fun just to see the incredible historical liberties taken by the writers.

Scott Forbes (a British actor who had found a home in American television's many dramatic anthology series) plays the title character.  Bowie and his brother Rezin (Peter Hanson) had invented the ""Bowie Knife"" and the opening credits begin with a knife being thrown into a wooden door.  Then begins the theme song by the King's Men Quartet (not to be confused with the pop group that gave us ""Louie Louie"" a few years later).

Based on a novel ""The Tempered Blade"" by Monte Barrett, the series is set in the Louisiana-Texas region during the 1830's and the many episodes have Jim interacting with historical figures from the period like Andrew Jackson, John James Audubon, and Jean Lafitte the Pirate.  If you were a young boy back in 1957 you could have mistakenly formed the impression that Lafitte was a central figure in American history, as it was his gold doubloons that the Hardy Boys were after on the ""Mickey Mouse Club's serial: ""Applegate's Treasure"".

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.

""Jim Bowie Jim Bowie, he was a bold adventurer man.  Jim Bowie Jim Bowie, he battled for rights with a powerful hand.  His blade was tempered and so was he, indestructible steel was he.  Jim Bowie Jim Bowie Jim Bowie, he was a fighter, a fearless and mighty adventurer man"".

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1204243200,19,1639,4.701754385964913
2827485,5,B000PMLJLW,"HUGE, I took this long to finish. We never saw the show looking this nice on TV, you can pick out the stunt-men. Too clear? Nah, we all sang the song back then when it was grainy. See if you can resist singing with your dvds. A real honest to goodness hit in it's day, watch the actresses watch Mr. Forbes, my hero when I was five.",1427846400,,331,3.955223880597015

2827488,3,B000PMLJLW,"Maybe I am being a little tough on the series by comparing it to shows like ""Wyatt Earp"" and the early seasons of ""Have Gun will Travel,"" but ""Jim Bowie"" doesn't capture my interest very well.  The stories are often silly and wander too much for a half-hour show.  Scott Forbes and the supporting cast are very good (especially like the 10-year old Francois played by Paul Playdon), but they can't carry the whole show.  The premise that the knife is more powerful than the gun (even a single-shooter) doesn't seem plausible to me.  The series was inexpensive, so from that standpoint, it was a good buy.",1403827200,2,604,4.616822429906542
2827489,5,B000PMLJLW,"I vaguely remember this series as a child, and was happy to revisit it thanks to one of the retro tv stations.  I found a few episodes that I did remember and eagerly purchased this set to be able to view the entirety of the series.  While some of the episodes are a little silly, at times, it reflects a gentler time when tv taught lessons of morality in a less heavyhanded way than today.",1401753600,3,390,4.1866666666666665
2827490,4,B000PMLJLW,"I had only saw a few episodes of this rarely shown series over the years. While I expected it to be on the kiddie western level which in many ways it is. I was also pleasantly surprised it can be entertaining as well. Scott Forbes is well cast and at times charming as Jim Bowie. If you are nostalgic for shows of the 50's and 60's and don't mind black and white films this is a fun way to spend 25 minutes. I don't know how historically accurate the series is probably many liberties were taken for entertainment sake. I enjoyed the show for what it is, simple entertainment from a much simpler time.",1400544000,3,601,4.280701754385965
2827491,4,B000PMLJLW,"Jim Bowie was a hero and this series helped with bring him up a even more heroic hero .  He helped during the revolutionary wars, and was always a larger than life person.  Scott Forbes, Jim Bowie, played the role very good, Jim was not the super hero or guy who does every thing right.  They brought to the screen a lot of lose events that took place and Scott did his best to make Jim real.",1398988800,2,392,4.064935064935065
2827492,5,B000PMLJLW,"I am on disc 3 season 5&6.  So far they have been great.  At the begining of each episode there is a brief history of Louisiana according to what the episode is about.  The pictures are clear.  Each episode has romance, adventure, fun, and a moral behind it.  My only complaint is that, unlike the 2 disc collection, these episodes do not play one after the other.  Also, one episode appears twice, but it is a good one.  Each disc has about 5 - 6 episodes and lasts about 3 hours.  Great family viewing.  Good buy.  You will be enjoying it for years.",1397260800,,551,4.262135922330097
2827493,5,B000PMLJLW,This is a collection from my past. There wasn't a week went by that I didn't watch Jim Bowie I like history and this was a small part of what it took to build this Nation. Should you choose to watch this collection don't be surprised if you get caught up in the moment. This is very entertaining try to count how many times Jim Bowie get knocked out its kind of a wonder he didn't suffer brain damage. Ha Ha. Should you choose to watch it you will find that it is a lost art. There aren't any computers to enhance the action sequences. just whole lot of Stunt men  Enjoy.,1396656000,2,571,4.098214285714286
2827494,5,B000PMLJLW,Found a 13 episode package at a bargain bin - my brother and I both enjoyed them - hadn't realized they were all available until I took a look at Amazon.

These shows are WONDERFUL and you will find the kind of programs that ALL THE FAMILY can enjoy without worrying about content and language!  There are PLOTS to these shows even in the short time and CREATIVE WRITING and funny lines and actual humor and I am SO grateful.  I'll take this any day over the programming that is on now.  I recommend to anyone that has NEVER heard of this show to give it a shot; I see the actors we grew to love in their early days in these shows and the good message and great feeling I have when I finish a show is so terrific!

This is a fabulous Western TV Series from the early days of the Western Genre.  Like many of its contemporary counterparts, this series excelled with its top-notch Writing along with great Acting.  The reproduction is high quality Audio/Video and is a must-have for all Western Buffs.

Scott Forbes plays the ""Jim Bowie"" character with great precision and his real-life Wife plays in 3 episodes.",1461974400,,571,7.0
8192870,2,B000PMLJLW,"This first review is due to deffective cases in three of the five in the set. The hubs were deffective so the discs were loose and would not reseat... resulting in scratches on two of the six discs that were very noticeable and minor scratches on the rest.  Fortunately I have replacements and will check out all potential problems and update my review after viewing complete series.
Two stars only for the case issues.",1453161600,2,419,4.662162162162162
