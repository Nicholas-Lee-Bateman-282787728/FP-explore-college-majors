7912500,4,B00000JLXQ,"I got this VHS tape for my 80+ year-old parents, who use the exercises to stay in shape.  They practice with it 4 to 5 times each week.  It keeps them limber and toned without any stress to any joints, particularly the knees.  It helps Mom with her arthritis.  They had this tape, but their evil VHS player ate about five feet of the tape, and it wasn't possible to smooth it out.  Now that the tape is evidently out of print, I felt very fortunate to find it for the folks and gain some brownie points in the process.  Heck, I'll be happy just to accept some of Mom's brownies!  I gave the thing 4 stars.  If it was available in DVD, that would rate the 5th star.  This tape is a godsend for my folks.",1200096000,3,702,4.065693430656935
