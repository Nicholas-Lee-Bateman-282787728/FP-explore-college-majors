8218497,5,B000VEA3N4,Robert Wilson is a treasure!  His range of choices for plot-concepts seems to be exceeded only by the variety of ways that he can shine a spotlight on behavior that often goes unnoticed.  I find his work fascinating.,1466640000,,216,4.657894736842105

8218499,5,B000VEA3N4,"This documentary introduced me to Robert Wilson, now a creative genius in his 60s, whose confidence and success belie his beginnings as a stuttering young gay man growing up in 1950s Waco, Texas.  The film swings back and forth between the story of Wilson's life and his experimental art work, a perfect method, as his theatrical works and designs were often representations of the sometimes traumatic events in his personal life.  His story is fascinating and his work is uniquely amazing.",1410739200,,490,5.037037037037037

8218501,4,B000VEA3N4,I have heard o him but never watch anything from him. This is a really good and creative way to do experimental plays.,1364083200,,118,4.173913043478261
8218502,5,B000VEA3N4,I saw this film recently and was inspired! I have had an interest in Robert Wilson for a little while now and after seeing this film I felt inspired to create. So much of what we see in the theatre is merely a representation of what we see on television. This is theatre that can't be filmed. Wilson allows space and time to become part of the narrative. Nothing HAS to HAPPEN every minute. We are so used to being bombarded which information that we forget we need space to think for ourselves. If you want to create theatre that is different then watch this and be inspired!,1303689600,7,576,4.342592592592593
8218503,5,B000VEA3N4,"Last time I have seen Robert Wilson is at the 2008 Spoleto Festival where his Hamlet was presented on video. It was shown at the end of a conference where he spoke about his first experiences in avant-gard theatre before introducing his Hamlet. These first experiences are the ones on which this documentary focuses since they are the most significant. The most intriguing one is definitely Deafman Glance. It is a silent opera built around the fantasies of a deaf-mute african-american kid that Wilson adopted after he defended him from the harassment of a policeman in 1967. Wilson talked about it at his conference in Spoleto. Before leaving, his last words were Hamlet last words ""the rest is silence"". There is a sense of tragic and absurd and at the same time a sense of hope in Wilson theatre which is rendered in this dvd.",1228176000,,830,4.731034482758621

8218505,5,B000VEA3N4,"If you don't know Robert Wilson's work you don't know what genius you are missing.  Many people know him principally through his work with Philip Glass on 'Einstein on the Beach'.  But there is indeed a great deal more.

This is a balanced overview of the work of one of the finest and most innovative dramatists of the 20th Century.  His is a theater of images and artistic collaboration.

Wilson has worked with the likes of Philip Glass, Tom Waits, William Burroughs, Lou Reed, Jessye Norman and many more.  He has written plays, produced other's plays, produced opera and worked with sculpture and other visual media.

This is a fascinating, sensitive and unique artist whose work deserves to be better known.  Despite his work being in demand and receiving critical acclaim there is relatively little written about him.  He is hardly a househould name.  And this film does an admirable job of showing us the depth and breadth of this man's work.  Hopefully it will make him more familiar to the public at large and insert his name into the common discourse.

A great film which does justice to a great man.",1200096000,10,1111,4.729166666666667
