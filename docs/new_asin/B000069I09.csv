1735353,4,B000069I09,"I like THE TENANT better with each viewing.  It's similar in mood to REPULSION (some call this the ""male version"" of that film), and is the last chapter of what others have called the Apartment Trilogy (along with REPULSION and ROSEMARY'S BABY).  Polanski fans will love this, more mainstream fans might think the pace is a little too slow.  I think it's great.  Watch Polanski slide into madness, similar to Catherine Deneuve's slide in REPULSION, though he starts on more firm ground than did she.  Polanski is superb as Trelkovsky, nobody else could have played the role.  Watch this with the English subtitles (no matter what audio track you choose), as you'll need them at points.  I watched this on video without subtitles, struggled through some quiet dialogue and occasionally Polanski's accent, and then watched the DVD with subtitles.  It made a world of difference.  One of my favorite neglected films, I recommend it highly.",1059782400,12,936,4.987096774193549
1735354,5,B000069I09,"Deliberately paced, ultimately gripping film about a seemingly nice, normal single man who moves into an apartment whose previous tenant, named Simone, committed suicide by jumping out the window. He meets her friend Stella (Isabelle Adjani) and finds himself unwittingly in the unfortunate girl's footsteps. Her brand of cigarettes, her favorite chocolate drink, her clothes and even her tooth (stuck in a hole in the wall) haunt him. No one seems to understand his concerns...least of all the difficult and bizarre tenants he's surrounded by who complain of his every move. He comes to believe it's a plot to drive him to suicide...like Simone. Roman Polanski (who co-wrote and also directed) is brilliant as Trelkovsky, the quiet tenant who's plunged into a nightmare that may or not be real. He's believable as an Everyman who suddenly finds himself alienated and in the grips of something he can't control. Is he going mad? Or is it...something else? Shelley Winters (as the concierge), Melvyn Douglas, Jo Van Fleet and Lila Kedrova as the other tenants contribute their considerable panache---making Trelkovsky's paranoic nightmare world even more sinister.  A fascinating and haunting psychological journey that keeps you intrigued (and disturbed) right up until the final, bone-chilling scream. Not for every taste, but still ""The Tenant"" is pure cinema terror all the way. The DVD is a fine widescreen print that includes the original theatrical trailer. Even IT'S scary. Enjoy this macabre masterpiece. But I don't recommend watching it alone.",1058572800,18,1553,5.338775510204082
1735355,5,B000069I09,"I bought this DVD solely because I have always wanted to see this film ever since a friend told me it is Polankski's best. I found it especially disturbing, I think, because I saw it shortly after seeing ""The Pianist."" The social isolation of Polanski's character (a timid but clever young man who manages to take over the apartment of a dying woman even before she dies from injuries sustained in a suicide leap), the fascist-like brutality of the the neighbors, and the ever-growing maddening tension that pushes the film forward are all elements that  Polanski used effectively once again in his more recent masterpiece. This juxtaposition made me think about how even the most mundane lives are small reflections of a vaster political landscape. Of course, one doesn't need to draw these comparisons to be blown away by ""The Tenant."" (In fact, the film has more obvious links to ""Rosemary's Baby."") The film can be appreciated as a well-constructed, flawlessly acted (Melvyn Douglas as the landlord and Shelley Winters as the concierge are great) suspense thriller. I highly recommend it.",1058572800,9,1092,5.033149171270718
1735356,5,B000069I09,"""The Tenant"" is not everyone's cup of tea. If you enjoy Roman Polanski, this small 1976 film is truly a masterpiece.  To tell too much of the plot gives away a great deal.  It deals with madness, tragedy and is truly a creepy movie.  There is also a great deal of humor and wit.  A standout cast including Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Shelley Winters lend tremendous support to Polanski's riveting performance.
Not a film to watch late at night when you are alone.",1057622400,5,471,4.571428571428571
1735357,5,B000069I09,"...... or, ""Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are In My Wall.""
There are differing views on this somewhat small film, but I think in the big picture of RP's filmmaking career, The Tenant will stand out as his most personal work. If you know anything about this man's life, what he went through (and what he was about to go through, a scandal that caused him to flee the U.S.), the events in this very darkly humorous tale become all the more haunting.
The basic story: a socially awkward clerk moves in to an apartment previously occupied by a young woman who just died from injuries sustained by hurtling herself from that very apartment window. What he doesn't realize is that, by his moving in, the stage has been set for him to inherit the very miserable despair that possessed the former tenant. In the course of his solitary tenency, he hears disturbing sounds, sees strange things inside and outside his flat, and encounters inexplicable hostility from others in the building. Over time, he becomes increasingly unnerved and obsessed, incapable of controlling his own behavior, and the line between reality and delusion ultimately dissolves, giving way to psychosis.
This dark ride is not without Polanski's trademark warped, absurdist humor, and one gets a sense from sharing the deteriorating experience of his self-portrayed protagonist that he himself was trying to find a way to laugh at his own miseries and fears. This could be a therapeutic element of this film; by watching the ridiculously hopeless and wretched scenario unfold, hopefully we can laugh at our own vulnerabilities, while at the same time seeing that element in other peoples' callous behavior that drives others into such a state.
With Polanski's new found recognition in a film industry that cautiously turned its back on him nearly 30 years ago, we are finally given a chance to see this forgotten treasure, and it's about time. I've read many comparisons to Taxi Driver, but the subtle supernatural implications found in The Tenant's more surreal moments remind me more of The Shining, wherein an alienated individual renders himself prone to dark, irrational powers by way of his own obsession. A quiet, well-paced primal scream of a movie, this number will definitely give the viewer a twisted chuckle, and more than a few shivers after it ends. A no-holds barred, lights out masterpiece.",1049587200,70,2367,4.97979797979798
1735358,5,B000069I09,"Paranoia. Alienation. Suicide. These are the themes of Roman Polanski's 1976 film, The Tenant. The film is tragically funny and creepy. Polanski's use of space in the apartment and the dark lighting invokes a creepy atmosphere.
The film follows a timid file clerk named Trelkovsky--played brilliantly by Roman Polanski himself--who moves into an apartment whose previous tenant, a woman named Simone, attempted suicide by jumping out of the window. He is informed by the landlord that he can rent the apartment only if Simone dies. With the hopes of her death, Trelkovsky visits her in the hospital by pretending and lying to the nurse that he is a friend. He meets Estella (Esabelle Adjani), a real friend visiting, next to Simone's bed. When he witnesses Simone lying on the bed wrapped with white bandages from head to toe like a mummy, Simone unloads a haunting scream--as if she is vengefully passing her curse to Trelkovsky. Her scream would echoe and follow Trelkovsky when he immediately leaves the hospital with Estella. After hearing of her death, Trelkovsky celebratingly moves into the apartment where his paranoia and downfall begins.
This film is one of my all-time favorites because it belongs in that ""man in his room"" category. There are only a few films out there like it. I think I can only name a few such as Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, Vampire's Kiss, Love Object, or the French film, I Stand Alone. What I mean by ""man in his room"" is existential loneliness like the protagonist in Jean-Paul Sartre's Nausea. The person is isolated in his space and is left with only to reflect or create his own world. In Trelkovsky's case, he creates a world of conspiracy in which the other tenants in the apartment are trying to make him commit suicide. And what happens with Trelkovsky's delusion is ultimately a funny but tragic climax.
The first time I saw this film, I thought it was creepy and dark. But the more times I watched it even though it is still creepy and dark, I begin to realized more and more about Polanski's humorous intent. The tragic ending is just undeniably hilarious. I just start laughing out of control.
Roman Polanski is one of my favorite filmmakers and The Tenant is his best. It is very fortunate that he played the protagonist in the film. The Tenant is truly a Polanski tour-de-force. The Tenant's score, which I really love, is simultaneosly hypnotic and tragic. (Ingmar Bergman's cinematographer, Sven Nykvist, is also doing the lighting.) Paramount did a great job with the DVD image quality of this Polanski film.",1026172800,41,2563,4.867276887871854
1735359,5,B000069I09,"Not everyone's favorite Polanski film, but it's great to have it out there.  The ""plot"" concerns a man taking a flat in a Paris walk-up,(the conceriege is Shelly Winters, one of the neighbors is Melvyn Douglas) and sure enough it was once rented by an extremely strange now-dead tenant.  It gets weirder from there (don't miss the make-out scene in the Bruce Lee film).  This is one of Polanski's finest and strangest.  There's eyes in walls and an incessant tapping by the sink.  Polanski is the main character, even more than he was Pardon Me <the Fearless Vampire Killers>.  This is a movie for late at night, when the lights are out and you're willing to be weirded out of your mind.  Not to miss for fans of David Lynch or David Cronenberg--it seems to have had a lasting effect on those two gentlemen.  You will not have seen much like this one.  A definite five star odd movie.",1026086400,7,884,4.509433962264151

1735373,4,B000069I09,"A Polish man living in France (Roman Polanski) moves into the apartment of a woman who has committed suicide and soon becomes tormented by what he perceives as the persecution of his neighbors and his frightening identification with the dead former tenant.

Although it is generally classified as a horror film, it is difficult to see it as one in the traditional sense, since it deals with the fear of the loss of identity rather than the fear of death.  In this way, it may have something in common with David Cronenbergs work.  When he moves into his apartment, Trelkovsky is a very mild man with a very subdued personality; he seems happy to just live quietly and unnoticed.  However, the world overwhelms him and his very self seems to be overwritten and reconstructed by a well-ordered French society that really seems to have no use for him.  Director and star Polansky makes it a point to show us how suspicious his status as a foreign national makes him to French citizens.  This puts him on the road to madness",1478304000,,1020,4.638888888888889

1735390,5,B000069I09,"If you want to have more idea of what this film is about, you may guess his other films <Rosmary's Baby> and <Repulsion> and that will do it just fine. As all we know, Roman Polanski made so many good movies in his career and since he is still alive, he will still have chance to make more good movies. We can simply remember his works like <Chinatown><Rosemary's Baby><Tess><Repulsion><The Pianist> and so on. It's just countless.

Sometimes I think like he deserves to make that all kinds of strange behaviors in his life with all kinds of women.

Anyway, this movie is kind of a hidden classic horror that you shouldn't miss.

As I mentioned earlier, you will instantly guess <Rosemary's Baby><Repulsion> during watching this film. If you research a little, you will find out that this movie was made way later then both films and you can see that this movie was influenced by both films in somehow.

The first half of the film is absolutely boring since the man, Trelkovsky acted by Roman Polanski himself's life was boring and when he moved to this apartment and the previous tenant, the woman was in the hospital having suicide attempt.

For some strange reason, Roman Polanski goes to meet this woman to the hospital and instead he meets the lady's friend Isabelle Adjani.

She and him had sex without even knowing each other.

Then strange things begins to happen.

You see, the apartment has only one bathroom in the building and from his aprtment, he can see the other building right next to his. There is a man always looking outside and it seems very strange.

One day he finds out that when he is in the bathroom, he can see himself in his room looking outside just like that strange man did. What is going on? Is this a phantom or some kind of fantasy that he created?

Little by little he thinks that all the tenants are trying to make him having suicide just like the other woman who lived in that apartment room.

It was a conspiracy theory that is in his mind. Is it real or just a creation from his head?

When he goes to Isabelle Adjani's aprtment and spend the night there, next moring, he sees the man from his apartment knocking at the door and thinks that she is part of them too.

Everyone are together in this conspiracy after all. They all want him to be die just like the woman.

He then wears the woman's clothes who died finally at the hospital and wears her makeup. Then he finally jumpped off the room just like that woman did.

First time he jumpped, it was not all hurt.

All the tenants came out and tried to call the police and made chaose.

Then he goes to his apartment and jumps again. This time he becomes just like that woman. He literally became like a mummy. Dressed with plaster all over his body.

The director indicated that all this things about this conspiracy was from this man's head. He was just lonely and had no job and little by little he began to imagine things I guess.

But again it was pretty scary what was happened even though it was not all real.

That was the beauty of this film which is this director is good at.

Some images like when someone was trying to enter his apartment through the window and Roman was trying to stab his hand with the knife, we see the hand only comes in from the window, that was kind of surrealistic which totally reminded me of his other movie <Repulsion> a masterpiece a mental horror film.

To be honest, Isabelle Adjani didn't do a lot of things for her roll and it could have been any girl to do that roll. It was kind of a waste for her doing that roll.

It was the director himself who was really shined acting for his own film.

I acted for 3 years for my MFA program at stage cause everyone should act for the class as film directing program and I know how hard to act/direct at the same time and Roman Planski did it so casually as if it is like his daily job.

Though this film is widely hailed as one of the greatest underground-cult masterpieces, I could never understand how this film slid under the radars of being one of Polanski's masterpieces. However anybody that I have ever met was taken the time to watch this film is always regarded it to be one of at least the top 10 favorite films of all time.

Polanski made a lot of outstanding movies, most of which are classics by now...this one is his very best of the 1970's decade.
Some interesting facts about this film include:

1) The movie is based on Roland Topor's novel The Tenant (1964).
2) Polanski heavily barrowed from a Polish movie Sublokator (1966).  The two films have identical story lines and creepy atmosphere.
3) The movie was made right before the scandal, which followed his sexual conduct with a minor in Jack Nicholson's house in LA.
4) I would say this film ranks in the top 5 of Polanski's masterpieces, such as: Knife in the Water (1962), Repulsion (1965), The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967), and Rosemary's baby (1968).
5) This film is mentioned in the movie High Life (2009) by the character played by Timothy Olyphant.

Polanski showcases his many talents both off and on screen. His acting is surprisingly top notch and you really feel for this character even though his thoughts may be blown way out of proportion.

The Tenant is a Roman Polanski film about paranoid delusion. Or is it? A Frenchman named Trelkovsky, who is portrayed by Polanski himself, rents an apartment in which a young woman recently committed suicide. After moving in, Trelkovsky begins to believe that the neighbors in the complex conspired to torment the women until she committed suicide. He soon realizes he may be the next target. Is Trelkovsky gradually being driven mad by his mysteriously hostile neighbors or is he being pursued by the spirit of the dead woman? Is the bone left behind by the woman hidden in a hole in the wall some type of fetish? As Trelkovsky slowly takes on the characteristics of the dead woman, the mystery deepens. This film was the official French entry at Cannes in 1976.  It is considered the last of Polanski's apartment trilogy, following Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. Roger Ebert says ""The Tenant's not merely bad -- it's an embarrassment."" Other reviewers disagree and feel that ""The Tenant is one of Roman Polanski's greatest and darkest films."" It has become a cult favorite and is perhaps best known for its director dressing as a woman. Polanski won a Best Director Oscar for the film The Pianist, which also won best picture.

1735456,3,B000069I09,"Having read Roland Topor's masterful novel 'The Tenant' only a few weeks ago, I was primed and ready for Roman Polanski's take on the persecuted and haunted character of Trelkovsky.  Though I am more familiar with Mr. Polanski's reputation as a filmmaker than with his films, I did expect him to bring a singular vision to the adaptation - even if that vision differed from my interpretation.  That it does, but where the film clumsily stumbles is in its failure to show the cause and effect necessary to support even the director's view.

'The Tenant' is the story of Trelkovsky, an unassuming everyman, who takes an apartment recently vacated by a woman, Simone Choule, who committed suicide.  Once settled, he starts finding artifacts of Mlle. Choule's around the apartment that have an unhealthy attraction for him.  Coupled with that, he has continuous problems from his neighbors, who constantly harangue him with complaints about noise coming from his apartment.  The lingering presence of Mlle. Choule, the harassment by his neighbors, and the slow disintegration of Trelkovsky's identity lead him to believe that his neighbors are scheming to turn him into a copy of Mlle. Choule - and for him to suffer her same fate.

It may be unfair to review the film so soon after reading the source material, but because of that exposure, I do know that for the first two-thirds of the movie, Mr. Polanski was almost obsequious in his faithfulness.  Much of the dialogue came straight from the book, and the actors were outstanding in their roles (including a stellar turn by Shelley Winters).  Mr. Polanski himself, as Trelkovsky, nailed the timid title character exactly as I had pictured him, but as the character loses his grip on reality, I was disappointed to see that the director's view diverged so radically from mine.

The Question: are the neighbor's threats all in Trelkovsky's mind, or is something more infernal going on?  I felt the novel might have been a mixture of both, though mostly I had the impression there was a real, external danger.  Mr. Polanski's version ignored that possibility, and presented the horror as all inside Trelkovsky's head.  But does it matter since both narratives share the same events right up to the end?  I think so, as that makes the movie only a psychological chiller - the novel is a much more frightening allegory of humanity's cloven-footed habits throughout history.

Since each opinion is valid, I can't penalize a film that doesn't conform to my preconceived ideas - but I can dock it for failing to present its own views adequately.  I can accept bizarre characters and storylines, but the established elements must evolve during the film along believable lines.  When Trelkovsky dons a housedress left behind by Mlle. Choule, and paints his face with cosmetics, it struck me that the film hadn't provided enough underpinning for his actions.  Knowing what I knew about the story, I could see that the clues were there - just carefully hidden - but I felt that someone else watching might be scratching their head and wondering what Mr. Polanski was thinking.  Trelkovsky seemed to go from a timid cipher to a cross-dressing lunatic for little or no reason.  Granted, the reasons were in his mind, which is difficult to present on screen, but I believe I would have had a hard time understanding his motivations, including those that influenced his decisions at the movie's end, from the film's storyline alone.

It's possible that I'm being too harsh, and that those unfamiliar with the book will still be able to easily follow along with the movie.  I will say that the film should appeal to viewers with a heightened appreciation for subtle nuance, and that those who are used to a more contemporary presentation of horror may want to take a pass.  Those in the middle, like me, but without prior information, may find 'The Tenant' to be a well-acted, interesting film - right up until it falls apart in the final act.",1244160000,6,3977,4.885416666666667
1735457,5,B000069I09,"Strange.  Bizarre.  Creepy.  These are words that can be used to describe Roman Polanski's ""The Tenant.""  They can also be used to describe the residents of the Parisian apartment building into which Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) moves.  The former resident, Simone, leaped from the window and laid, wrapped like a mummy, in the hospital before dying.  Soon, Trelkovsky believes that there is a conspiracy among the neighbors to force him to also commit suicide  Does this diabolical conspiracy exist only in his insane imagination or is it real?  The viewer never knows for sure and this makes the film highly provocative.

  Having watched Polanski's occult masterpiece, ""Rosemary's Baby,"" I can't help but believe that Trelkovsky is part of a complex Satanic conspiracy.  The neighbors are Satan worshippers who have conspired to drive him insane and force him to commit suicide as a type of human sacrifice.  They treat him as though he is Simone, giving him her mail and serving him her hot chocolate and Marlboros.  He receives her photograph of the Egyptian sarcophagus from the Louvre.  Next, he sees Egyptian hieroglyphics on the wall of the communal bathroom - the wall upon which residents have been seen staring as though entranced.  There is also the human tooth embedded in his apartment wall.  Simone's tooth?  It would imply that part of her lives on in the apartment, preserved like a mummy, for eternity.  Perhaps it is her soul, or ghost, that compels him to wear her clothes and put on a wig.

  Commentary from Roman Polanski, explaining the mystery behind the apartment building and its residents, would've been nice.  As usual, Paramount has provided us with an awesome reproduction of the film but has not taken the time to add special features except for a short trailer.  There are, however, English subtitles for us hearing impaired.

  ""The Tenant"" is highly recommended for fans of psychological horror, fans of occult thrillers, and fans of Roman Polanski's works.  I have not seen his ""Repulsion"" but I hear that it also deals with the deterioration of a warped psyche.",1235779200,5,2098,5.0028985507246375

1735471,2,B000069I09,"Roman Polanski and Gerard Brach, the screenwriting team behind Polanski's 1965 apartment house horror film ""Repulsion"", had less success in adapting Roland Topor's novel ""Le locataire chimrique"" for the screen. It's difficult to say if ""The Tenant"" is trying to be a suspense or an absurdist parody of a suspense, but it hardly matters, as the film is neither scary nor funny. I can say with certainty is that it is too long. It feels like the story has been forcibly stretched. Ironically, the premise is essentially the same as in ""Repulsion"": A tenant descends into schizophrenic madness amid odd neighbors and eerie production design, alone in his apartment.

A Parisian bachelor named Mr. Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) takes a dingy 2-room apartment in an old building, whose crotchety concierge (Shelley Winters) explains, ""The previous tenant threw herself out of the window."" His visits that former tenant, Simone, in the hospital, where he meets her friend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). But Trelkovsky, surrounded by Simone's belongings, can't get her suicide out of his mind. He sees people standing for hours in the toilet opposite his apartment. He is exasperated by the accusations of the building owner and the intrigues of his neighbors. Even Stella's kindness can't dispel his mounting paranoia.

The only good thing I can say about ""The Tenant"" is that Polanski's Trelkovsky seems authentically unassuming up to a point: He's genuinely pleased to find an apartment, embarrassed by his annoying co-workers, and really trying to be a nice guy. But nothing is interesting beyond that. His hallucinations and obsessions are more comic than frightening, but not enough to be entertaining, and his suffering inspires no empathy. To be clear, all dialogue is in English, which substitutes for French, presumably to make the film more commercial. The Paramount 2003 DVD includes a theatrical trailer (1 min).

Roman Polanski does brilliant acting, I actually think he was born for the part.
When he transforms completly into Simone you believe it totally. That classic line that he/she says as she looks into the mirror, ""I think I am pregnant!"" is so funny and so sad that it stays in your mind forever.

1735474,5,B000069I09,"I am not a fan of the genre, but I think most viewers did not approach the film ""The Tenant"" for truly what it is: a psychological thriller.  Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) suffers from schizophrenic psychosis and yearns to be a female.  Simone is his Id and he turns into Simone at night where he goes to the bar next door and buys Marlboro cigarettes and hot chocolate, etc.  In the day, he buys men's cigarettes (Gaulloise) and drinks dark coffee.  The moment when he was standing with Stella early in the film and we get to see Simone's mouth is the moment when the director of the movie chooses to tell us what happened.  This is the right interepretation: Simone and Roman Polanski are one and the same.  People will enjoy the movie more when they see it this way and understand it as a double personality.  Polanski playing as Simone did not commit the second suicide in the last scene within minutes after the first attempt, but rather there was a period of a few days that repairmen came and fixed the glass till a second suicide was attempted.  Hence the tenants said ""not again"".  Another detail is that Stella knows Simone and also knows Roman Polanski the man, she is a friend to both of them but she does not know they are the same person, till Roman Polanski gets to believe that she is ""conspiring"" against him with the other tenants and the landlord.  Another hint is that viewers should accept that there is time-jumping in the film.  Polanski as Simone now all bandaged and in the hospital is looking at Stella and Polanski the man in the last scene.  It is really the same scene as in the beginning of the movie, only we see it for what it is, a schezophrenic character: Freud would love this movie!!",1193443200,4,1717,4.467948717948718
1735475,3,B000069I09,"The Tenant (Roman Polanski, 1975)

Sometimes you put a brilliant novel together with a brilliant director and you get a brilliant movie. Sometimes, on the other hand, you get a movie that should be brilliant, but isn't quite, and you can't put your finger on why. That, in a nutshell, is The Tenant.

Set in the same Parisian housing crisis that was the setting for Last Tango in Paris, The Tenant is the story of Trelkovsky (Polanski), who gets an apartment in a decidedly weird building owned by Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas). While renting the place, he is told by the concierge (Shelley Winters) that the previous owner threw herself out the window; he goes to the hospital to see her (to ensure she hasn't long to go; after all, if she survives, he can't rent the apartment) and meets her friend Stella (Isabelle Adjani), with whom he embarks on a hesitant, but tumultuous, relationship. Everything seems to be going relatively well, except that the neighbors in the building are strange-- he often sees someone standing in the bathroom across the way, just staring out the window, and everyone seems to have an absurd preoccupation with noise. Eventually, Trelkovsky becomes convinced that the others in the building murdered the previous tenant, and that he's next.

Roland Topor's novel, upon which this film is based, is a wonderful piece of outsider art. And what's all the more odd here is that The Tenant is, as far as adaptations go, a relatively faithful one; no major scenes or subplots were eliminated, that I could tell. What this shows, ultimately, is the futility of the idea of the faithful book-to-screen translation. Much of the subtext of Trelkovsky's character, especially the haunting feeling in the back of the reader's mind that Trelkovsky is being persecuted for being a foreigner, is absent from the film, and Polanski plays the relationship between Trelkovsky and Stella far less ambiguously than the Trelkovsky in the novel; the character here seems almost absurdly grateful at times just to have a girlfriend, even when he's discussing such topics as his possible dismemberment. His paranoia remains, but it seems an isolated thing, rather than being a symptom of his rapidly-decaying mental state. Now, yes, I do realize that such things would be nearly impossible to bring to the screen in any reasonable manner, and that Polanski had to choose which aspects of Trelkovsky's character to emphasize when filming (at least he didn't have the intermediary of an actor, who might not have read the novel, filtering the character though his own experiences). That's my point, really; in any faithful adaptation, the movie is almost sure to suffer.

None of this is to say that the movie is valueless; far from it. If you like your comedy blacker than two-day-old coffee, your horror ludicrous, and your drama melo, then look no further than The Tenant for a thoroughly amusing time. However, be prepared; it's certainly not Polanski's strongest work. ***",1173744000,4,2982,4.981927710843373
1735476,5,B000069I09,"Roman Polanski's REPULSION was a terrifying descent into the world of isolation and complete madness. ROSEMARY'S BABY was a tale of child birth gone satanic with a delusional edge. THE TENANT is one of those psychological thrillers you have to pay close attention to in order to understand and fully grasp the concept of paranoia. It's one of the finest thrillers since Hitchcock's masterful PSYCHO. But THE TENANT is an altogether different experience.

We meet a working class man named Trevoltsky (played by Polanski himself) who is working in Paris and trying to find a new Apartment. We learn in the beginning that the place he's interested in once belonged to a woman by the name of Simone, a woman who was driven to suicide without specific explanation. After Trevoltsky manages to whisk the apartment away and move in, he goes to the hospital to meet Simone, who is in a complete bodycast and has suffered serious injury from her attempt at an end. There, Trevoltsky meets Stella, a young woman who he seems entranced with and is a friend of Simone's. They meet for drinks and go to see a movie, where they end up getting rather hot for each other but must reserve themselves after a few glances from an onlooker. They part ways and Trevoltsky goes off himself.

From there, we watch as the new neighbors of Trevoltsky become irritated with his late night antics and strange manner, and many strange things begin to happen that make Trevoltsky suspect there is something more going on then he's been thinking. For instance, when Trevoltsky discovers a tooth in his wall that was hidden, his reaction is the same as when we see him viewing it, like ""where the hell did this come from?"" And another instance is when Trevoltsky returns from a late night out with Stella, the landlord demands an explanation for Trevoltsky's actions with a woman that night in his apartment. But Trevoltsky explains he wasn't even there, and the descent into paranoia starts to sink in. Trevoltsky begins to suspect there's a plot against him from the neighbors and tries to let Stella in on this susposed devious madness. But even later in the movie Trevoltsky begins to suspect that even Stella is in on the whole deal with the neighbors and his paranoia starts to stir like crazy. By the time of the movie's climax, we see Trevoltsky has gone completely mad and is dressed like a woman and ends up attempting his suicide twice in the same instance, all the while delusions of the neighbors trying to aide in his demise torment him. He ends up in a body cast much like Simone and his fate is thus sealed.

THE TENANT is one of those thrillers where repeated viewings will get you to appreciate what Polanski has done here. What's he's created turns out to be a fine thriller in the vein of PSYCHO and REPULSION, and his exploration into the world of paranoia and delusions further cements his status as one of the great thriller directors of our generation. THE TENANT remains a fine suspense thriller that will make you think whether the next neighbors you have will leave you guessing at every turn.",1171238400,3,3090,4.697416974169742
1735477,5,B000069I09,"Roman Polanski became one of cinema's most capable film directors, and THE TENANT is among his very finest works in or out of Hollywood.

Polanski has an unparalleled ability to externalize and visualize human insanity, or impending insanity, and to portray that condition of mind on-screen in a way that is clear and understandable and palpable to a broad audience.

Other filmmakers certainly have portrayed hallucination, for instance, but rarely do we see a film that requires no explanation, interpretation or telegraphing, regarding which images are delusional.

Roman Polanski needs no such decoder ring.  He has a positive genius for devising images and shots which portray delusions as we would expect them to be; we quickly know what is illusion, what is reality, and what is, at a given point in his story's time line, still ambiguous for the story's purpose.

THE TENANT is a delectable treat for those viewers who can appreciate a journey into darkness, odd personalities, and extremely wry humor generated by nothing more contrived than human characters we've all encountered ourselves at some time or another.

The film segues deftly and seamlessly -- from serious moments, to undeniably hilarious moments, to moments of disturbing, frightening images leading inexorably to sub-climaxes, large or small, of stark horror.

THE TENANT is a fully formed film from start to finish, starting benignly enough (as with REPULSION) and developing into moments of human dysfunction to make one's skin crawl.

The last act and its climax are full of emotional complexity and revelation -- but so, in its way, is Polanski's first act as it establishes the protagonist's off-kilter existence at his new apartment.

The film is perfectly visualized with a sound effects track as inspired as that of ROSEMARY'S BABY. There are clues in it that casual viewers may miss.

Until REPULSION, this film's closest relative, is remastered, sharpened and fully framed, THE TENANT will stand unchallenged in Polanski's stellar career as his most disturbing film.

A slight spoiler:  The scene in which a woman's decapitated head is bouncing like a basketball with hair flying at Roman's balcony window would clinch this film's creative reputation single-handedly. But combined with the elderly folk in the downstairs apartment who blast their stereo with old standards and marching music for their own unique reasons, you have something far beyond the realm of mundane horror films.  This is thoughtful art exploring aspects of the human condition, inspired by a director with a singular eye for things quintessentially unsettling.",1168473600,10,2621,5.3019323671497585

If done well, I really like this type of film and found myself enjoying this one. I have not read the novel by Roland Topor, so I cannot draw comparisons between the movie and the book. It seems to me, however, that Mr. Topor was heavily influenced by the works of Franz Kafka. His use of absurdities, such as playing soccer with a human head and Mr. Trelkovsky changing into a woman, reminds me of ""The Metamorphosis."" The alienation, sense of solitude and conspiracy reminds me of ""The Trial."" Despite its morbid themes, the film also has a pervasive, dark humor to it that reminds me of both Kafka's writing and Stanley Kubrick's films. The film begins innocuously enough and really takes its time to build suspense. Although known as a director, it turns out Polanski can act and is quite charming and charismatic. It is his ability to carry the film as an actor that draws us into this film and captivates us, even though nothing terribly exciting happens at the onset. The film is filled with interesting characters and terrific dialogue, which alone would be enough to make the film worth recommending. Then there is the luminous Isabelle Adjani, who alone also would make the film worth watching. She is absolutely gorgeous, even behind those massive 70's glasses and funky clothes. Unfortunately, her time on screen is all too brief. One thing that bothers me a little is the fact the film was apparently shot in both English and in French, though one of the languages is dubbed, depending on which language track you choose. (i.e. the English is dubbed if watching in French and the French is dubbed if watching in English) I would rather watch the film in the original language with subtitles, even if it was shot using two or more languages. Just a minor grievance. Although it has nothing to do with the content of the film, I couldn't help but contemplate the relationship between Polanski and Eva Ionesco, who was about ten or eleven when the film was shot. Everyone is aware Mr. Polanski was forced to leave the United States because if his illicit contact with a thirteen year old girl, and most are aware that young Miss Ionesco posed nude for her mother at about the same age and appeared nude in such films as ""Spielen Wir Liebe."" Given that Mr. Polanski is also a photographer, I just could not resist wondering about that.",1164067200,3,2451,4.649769585253456

All in all this is a awesome movie, and highly suggest it for anyone",1162598400,2,295,4.016949152542373
1735480,4,B000069I09,"Roman Polanski is, without a doubt, my favorite post-studio system director. I adore the look of Jean Luc Godard and Martin Ritt, as well as enjoying almost everything Woody Allen had ever made(yes, I can even stand the bad ones). However, Polanski, to me, is a true genius of the modern era. Multi-talented, if he had one superior strength, it would be in his construction of the psychological drama. Like no other filmmaker, Polanski has always had the ability of placing the viewer inside the mind of the troubled soul. Although it is a place one would really never like to visit, there is something compelling about really getting inside a person's trauma and seeing it from the inside out.
I feel that he has never cut quite as deeply under the skin as in one of his last masterworks, The Tenant. Anyone to read this critique can get a real breakdown of the film in any of the other 'critiques' here(as in the world of modern film 'criticism', the 'critics' on the Amazon pages are merely more of the same: simply capsule reviewers, pontificating on their so-called immensity of depth and understanding of said media). On the other hand, I would just prefer to give a critique.
Sven Nykvist, The Tenant's photographer, had been shooting most of the Ingmar Bergman works since the early 60s. His attention to detail and use of different lenses aids immensely in sending this film down the corridor of madness that exists in both the aesthetic world and the psychological one of our hero. Polanski, as not just the film's director but the main character here, is a perfect fit in the 'dual' role of the lead, both insecure meek mouse and paranoiac mental case. He not only visually acts out the part(s), but characterizes his downward transition audibly, as well, through vocal intonation. Without really thinking about this, it's these sounds from his character that guide the viewer/listener through his stages of digression.
Now, for anyone who has ever seen his earlier work 'Repulsion', that is one of my favorite thrillers and a work that made my top 100 list of personal favorites. This may seem quite odd considering the uncomfortable storyline to that film, but, again, I actually felt like I had gotten inside the character of Catherine Deneuve, somewhat like taking a psych course but living it at the same time. However discomforting his earlier films may be, though, The Tenant surpasses them all. In fact, this is a picture, however much I like it-and I like it quite a bit-that could never make it on my all-time favorites list, mainly due to how much more troubling it is to sit through than even most of the uncomforting works of filmdom.
Filmmakers like David Lynch, Ken Russell, and John Waters come to mind. However, with these directors, the most bothersome their work becomes, it's still just a pseudo-fantasy world of surreality. Sure, possibly a bit irritating and offputting, but still just a film. In Polanski, the film is almost always a reality-and often one the viewer would just like to end. Yet, we cannot seem to turn away and stop watching-completely drawn towards the darkness, immersed in a world that at once is both shocking and repulsive as well as being exciting and engrossing. I can handle quite a bit when it comes to visual media, so long as there is some point to sustaining my attention. Here, though, although this film is not graphically violent or sexual in any manner, really, the subject matter, itself, seemed to make me dizzy with nausea. It's really hard to explain this factor except to note that this is not a film which I would go back to very often.
On the other hand, it may end up becoming an annual Halloween treat for me, one that - although year by year may consistantly and obnoxiously trick me - I could keep coming back for more, like a dog returning to the master who kicks him. Being a student of film much more than just a moderate filmgoer seeking entertainment, I thrive on films such as this that can take control of every nerve-ending and twist them until one's muscles begin to stiffen. Perhaps, then, the bad dream that The Tenant embodies, however upsetting, is most impressive and worthwhile due to the attention of detail and depth and, well, the reality that it conveys. Yes, reality, for there is nothing short of this that comes off more terrifying when wishing most to wake from the nightmare.",1162339200,4,4377,4.745406824146982
1735481,4,B000069I09,"As was the case with Roman's adaptation of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" you can read the book ""The Tenant"" (by Roland Topor) and watch the movie and see very little difference between the two.  Each winds up complimenting the other in one way or another.

Unfortunately, I have to concur with the reviewer below in that the movie *does* drag on too much - which is the only reason I knocked off a star.  Perhaps the script could have been really tightened up but, hey, hindsight is always 20/20 and we (the viewing public) always think we can do a better job than the director.

Normally, directors aren't very good actors (Ron Howard's success is the golden exception) but Roman played the perfect role in Trelkovsky, a loner bachelor who takes a Paris flat in an apartment with a recent tragedy in a building full of eccentrics (to say the least!).

The one aspect of Roman Polanski's film-making that always draws me to his films is the fact that he doesn't explain things.  He is the modern-day film-making school's nightmare in that good doesn't always win out over evil in the end nor does he tie loose ends up just to give people a happy, comfortable and satisfying feeling.  He gives the viewer a healthy dose of reality because life isn't about the fictional Hollywood endings of good over evil and everything turning out peaches and cream in the end.

The ending of the film gave me a clearer idea of the meaning behind author Roland Topor's conclusion to the book (which *really* leaves you scratching your head saying, ""What the...?"").

Though this is not one of my favorite Roman Polanski films, it's interesting, nonetheless, and is a great compendium to the book.  - Donna Di Giacomo",1155859200,2,1688,4.691525423728813

The story sounds really good and gripping - tenant moves into the apartment of a woman who committed suicide.  He feels something is going on with the building, the manager, and the other tenants.  Slowly, he begins to identify with the dead girl.  But the pace is so slow.  The main character, played by Roman Polanski, is so boring and unsympathetic that you wish he would just jump out of the window and get it over with.

...This is the 2nd Roman Polanski film ive seen so far and I think I enjoyed this film even more than Rosemary's Baby. You cant really put this film into words or categorize it. Its truly an eerie creepy slow moving film. Despite the fact it can be slow at times you still cant take your eyes off of it. I was enthralled by Polanski's character and portrayal of the polish immigrant living as the tenant in Paris. The overall atmosphere, the paranoia, the alienation and the plot are engaging. Ive seen many movies and this is unlike any other ive ever seen. It not only has the suspense and story which pulls you in deeper as the story progresses but it also has plenty of black humor to it. I laughed out loud in a couple scenes.

As soon as this film was over I turned it off then put it back on the shelf, but as the days went by I just kept thinking about it and wanting to watch it again.

1735487,4,B000069I09,"REVIEW: ""There's something going on in my building."" declares our protagonist, Trelkovsky, to his friends over dinner one night: and so begins his long, slow descent into fear and paranoia in Roman Polanski's dark, disturbing thriller ""THE TENANT"". This is the third (and weakest) entry in the director's so-called ""apartment house trilogy"" (preceeded by the classic ""REPULSION"", and the sinister evil of ""ROSEMARY'S BABY""). It stars Polanski himself (a canny move) as a quiet, somewhat put-upon fellow who is ecstatic to find an apartment for let in Paris that has just come open due to the previous tenant's suicide. From this sombre beginning the film becomes increasingly more and more bizarre: as the audience is never quite sure if Polanski's character is really in danger from the other neighbors (who may or may not have conspired to kill that former tenant), or whether someone is trying to drive him crazy, or whether he is having a complete mental breakdown. I won't give away the ending: but safe to say that the tremendous buildup turns out to be a bit of a let down (and that much of what went on before is left unexplained). Repeated viewings of the film helps to alleviate the initial sense of disappointment (while teasing its audience to try and figure out just what the heck is going on with this story). Of course, anything by Polanski is always worth watching, but the screenplays to ""REPULSION"" and ""ROSEMARY'S BABY"" were far more clearly defined nightmares (one internal, one external) of urban life. ""THE TENANT"" tries to have it both ways: as a psychological horror story and as a real-life horror story. Yet it falters a bit on both accounts despite the excellent performances, and the beautiful camera work by legendary cinematographer Sven Nykvist.

FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE: if you haven't yet seen the film then I would suggest you stop reading this review as I am going to reveal the ending to it. The whole gist of Trelkovsky's eventual descent into madness can also be analyzed from a spiritual point-of-view. As we see the poor guy becoming more and more unhinged it is certainly arguable that he is undergoing demonic possession: to the point of dressing like the dead woman who previously rented the apartment, speaking in her voice, and seeing all sorts of evil hallucinations. There are a couple of scenes I can refer to in order to back up this hypothesis: the earlier one inside a church where he attends Simone's funeral and has a panic attack (with the sermon by the priest gradually turning into a sadistic, mocking liturgy in which Trelkovsky ""hears"" him say such stuff as ""Christ ascended into Heaven and have joined the hosts of angels on high: but not for creeps like you"" and ""What are you doing here in my temple? The graveyard is where you belong! Thou shalt stink! Thou shalt stink like some putrified corpse lying along the wayside! Verily, I say unto thee: thou shalt never enter into my kingdom.""), and the gory finale where he is confronted by concerned neighbors but ""sees"" them morphing into forked-tongued snakes and demonic-looking monsters. The idea of the Devil exploiting Trelkovsky's own fears and weaknesses, and the final overtaking of his mind by evil forces may be a frightening way to view ""THE TENANT"", but it will certainly add to the discussion of the ordeal Polanski puts his audience through. Either way it is a terribly sad, terribly creepy, and terribly depressing motion picture.",1142467200,,3472,4.884745762711864

1735500,4,B000069I09,"Roman Polanski both directs and stars in a bizarre follow up to his classic ""Rosemary's Baby"", again displaying an affinity for old apartment houses in ""The Tenant"".

Polanski stars as Trelkovsky a droll, unassuming clerk who rents an apartment in Paris which became vacated due to the apparent suicide of the previous tenant.  The victim a young woman Simone Choule plummeted through a window crashing through a glass roof before hitting the ground.

Polanski moves in after being okayed by suspicious landlord Monsieur Zy played by veteran actor Melvyn Douglas.  His neighbors take an annoying stance with him pestering him with demands and conditions he must follow.

Within short order Polanski finds himself falling into the same habits as the dead girl, frequenting the same restaurants, ordering the same food , smoking the same brand of cigarettes.  Polanski gradually falls into a paranoic madness imagining the neighbors are plotting to drive him to a similar suicide attempt.  He eventually loses it completely dressing in drag and donning a wig, in his mind becoming the suicide victim Simone Choule.

1735520,3,B000069I09,"Why do French films have to be so patently weird?  This is what I was thinking as I watched The Tenant (1976) last night.  And not just weird, but make so very little sense?  Watching this film, I had flashbacks of Johnny Depp's 1999 film The Ninth Gate, which made about as much sense as The Tenant.  I've read that The Tenant, directed, co-written, and starring Roman Polanski (who also did The Ninth Gate), is supposed to be the third in a trilogy of films dealing with horror placed upon peoples in an urban setting (like they don't have enough problems with astronomical rent, limited parking, and cockroaches), the first being Repulsion (1965), followed by the second in Rosemary's Baby (1968).  Well, having seen all three, I'd have to say The Tenant is probably the least accessible of the three, but still pretty watchable, if you can get past the frustrations due to seemingly incoherent storyline and a less than straight-forward ending.  If you need your films to make sense, then skip The Tenant as you will be annoyed, bored, and generally feel compelled to come on here and offer a derogatory rant as to why people who like this film are pretentious art house goons who tout it thinking it's cool solely on the basis that it makes very little sense.  Also appearing in the film is Isabelle Adjani (Subway), Melvyn Douglas (Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House), Jo Van Fleet (Cool Hand Luke), and Shelley Winters (The Great Gatsby, The Night of the Hunter), as The Concierge (sort of like the landlady, except her responsibilities are limited to attending to the entrance, collection and distribution of the mail, and serving as janitor).

The film, set in France, stars Polanski as the relatively meek Trelkovsky, a modest man searching for an apartment.  As luck would have it, one has finally opened up, but Trelkovsky learns the reason for the vacancy is the last tenant tried to commit suicide, or, at least it appears that way.  Also, as it turns out, she's still alive, but not in any condition to contest her losing her apartment, and soon passes due to her many injuries.  Trelkovsky does move in, and thus begins his painfully slow descent into the dismal, delusionary, persecutory nether regions of that oft transgressed area we know as `the mentally disturbed'...one could say his visits to the dementia buffet are increasing at an exponential rate.  The question soon becomes is all that he's experiencing a product of a defective mind (Repulsion), or is it all well-orchestrated conspiracy aimed at drawing in a victim who's now inexorably forever linked to a nefarious scheme (Rosemary's Baby)?  Or both?  Or neither?  (well, that doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, but then neither did the film, so deal with it).  Oh wait, there's a third possibility...that of possession...it's certainly hinted at...

As I eluded to earlier, The Tenant seems to take liberally from Polanski's previous films, Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, retaining much of what made those films so well received, but lacks the coherence of either.  There's a lot to appreciate here, especially Polanski's performance, but the rewards are far and few between.  The one scene that comes to my mind is when Trelkovsky first visits the apartment building, meeting Winter's character for the first time, trying to get information about the vacant apartment.  He sees a little wiener dog sitting on the couch, and in a feeble effort to get into the Concierge's good graces, he comments on what a cute dog it is, and tries to pet it, to which the wee dog bares its' teeth and snaps at Trelkovsky, twice, setting up a pattern seen throughout the film of other characters and how they view Trelkovsky in general, with disdain and distrust (his character is basically a doormat throughout the film, allowing for anyone and everyone to walk all over him).  Polanski's character, seemingly a victim, comes off as less than likable, especially when he visits the hospital to check on the condition of the previous tenant, apparently waiting for her to finally pass before settling on moving into her now vacant apartment.  This all seemed rather ghoulish to me...and then his budding relationship with the previous tenant's best friend, Stella (Adjani), her mourning and trying to come to terms with the loss of her friend while Trelkovsky presents the pretense of actually knowing the deceased woman, his web of lies ever growing, made him appear even more creepy (and things do get creepier...much more so, especially once he finds the previous tenant's clothes).  The story eludes to many things happening, but there's little to tie everything together into a cohesive storyline (what was with the tooth in the hole in the wall?  And those hieroglyphics in the bathroom?  The significance escaped me on both of these matters).  Despite this, Polanski does manage to keep the atmosphere throughout tense and fraught with an impending sense of danger (the Kafka-esque quality some speak of), but I felt the payoff too little when compared to the slow, lengthy buildup.  The production looks wonderful, as do the interiors and very realistic location shots in Paris.  You could almost feel the dingy crawling off the wall and onto your skin of Trelkovsky's less than desirable bachelor pad.  I did feel the strengths tended to outweigh the weaknesses of this film, but I can't help feel after spending just over two hours watching this movie there should have been something more tangible waiting for me at the end.  I appreciate everything the film is (some of which I'm still unsure), but I can't shake the feeling of that of a lab rat, subject to an experiment I couldn't possibly understand.

The widescreen anamorphic picture on this DVD looks much better than the price seemed to suggest.  Also, the audio was strong and clear.  The only special feature is an original theatrical trailer.

1735521,4,B000069I09,"This creepy but not entirely effective thriller features Roman Polanski (also the director) as the title character, a quiet Parisian who has just moved into an apartment.  The previous tenant was a young single woman who -for unknown reasons - committed suicide by throwing herself out her window.  Once he moves in, he starts being harrassed by his neighbors and starts seeing strange things and begins to wonder if the previous tenant was driven to kill herself.

Are the neighbors evil, is there something supernatural going on or is he just going crazy?  Or is it a combination of these possibilities?  We are kept guessing through a lot of the movie, and even in the end, there can be different interpretations.

This is a good movie, but not the best of Polanski's efforts.  Parts of the movie are tediously slow and other parts are confusing, but as a whole, this is a well-made film:  creepy, suspenseful and generally entertaining.",1100822400,,940,4.867924528301887
1735522,4,B000069I09,"Roman Polanski stars and directs in this vicious, haunting little conte-cruelle set in Paris, in which a hapless, mild-mannered Parisian bureaucrat M. Trelkovsky (Polanski, channeling up Dustin Hoffman) rents an apartment whose previous tenant flung herself to her death from the bedroom window, and who now lingers comatose in the hospital, minutes from death. Trelkovsky negotiates a deal with merciless landlord Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas looming like an ancient human stormcloud), predicates it on the death of the hapless former tenant Simone Choule, and moves in on the news that the woman is dead and cold. Freakiness ensues.

Warning: this movie is vintage Polanski, very textured, very detailed, very meticulous, exceptionally deranged and disturbing---but not for the impatient. For best results, wait for an overcast day with the wind roaring in the trees and the rain pattering against the window, get a fire roaring in the hearth, drink some well-aged Scotch, and sit back and truly ensconce yourself in the weirdness.

""The Tenant"" is a waking nightmare in which you can't help but feel pity---and unfolding horror---for the dreamer.

Every one of us, I think, has had an experience with a nightmare landlord. When I was a feckless undergraduate, I rented an apartment from a miserly but prominent lawyer, a wretched creature straight from Dickens who materialized on my doorstep at 2 in the morning hours after I had called to warn him of my pipes bursting. The man was about 150 years old, full of scowling fury, and cursed at me to get a bucket as I was a ""useless, philandering young fool"" and had destroyed his apartment---despite the fact that the pipes were later found to have been indifferently maintained for decades.

The simple question at the dark heart of ""The Tenant"" is this: at what point are we ourselves? How much of ourselves must we sacrifice---at work, at play, in our daily lives---to live in society? At what point to we cease to be? Trelkovsky, eager to please, diffident in all aspects of his life and his civil-service job, anxious to avoid offense, lounges drunk on the bed of his lover (the astonishing Isabelle Adjani, here hopelessly gorgeous) and wonders by what right he considers himself---his being, his soul, his identity---to reside in his head. Why not the nose? The body? The arm? Or perhaps the tooth, one of which he finds concealed in a hole drilled into the apartment wall, swathed in a cotton ball, hidden behind the heavy wardrobe of the apartment's doomed former tenant.

Worse still, poor Trelkovsky suffers the renter's worst nightmare: he doesn't even have a toilet in his apartment, and has to make a sojourn through ill-lit, peeling hallways to go to the bathroom.

Director Polanski is note-perfect as the meek and meticulous Trelkovsky, eager to please, anxious to avoid offense. And equally note-perfect is Polanski's meticulous attention to detail in the atmosphere of malice: a harmless, noisy house-warming party brings the wicked attention of his draconian neighbors upon him, earns him the disdain of the matronly concierge (Shelley Winters, who shuffles and ambles and grumbles with lugubrious alacrity), and merits a nasty warning from his landlord. Worse follows his refusal to sign a petition against a supposedly ""noisy"" neighbor, and Trelkovsky finds himself constantly warned against making too much noise, consequently relegated to scuttling quietly about like a mouse in his own apartment.

""The Tenant"" is an invitation to follow Trelkovsky into a cycle the hapless renter should be familiar with: righteous indignation, an eagerness to please and forge allies, and ultimately a descent into obesssion and madness. Why does the local cafe insist on serving Trelkovsky hot chocolate and Marlboro smokes, both favored by his suicidal predecessor? What is the meaning of the late-night tenants who stand for hours in the communal restroom, looking for all the world like 16th century Russian Icons, standing like friezes, not moving a muscle? And why does Trelkovsky wake from tortured dreams to find himself cloaked in Simone's nightgown, his fingernails painted, his face rouged?

The transfer on this skeletal DVD is gorgeous---the film looks like it could have been shot yesterday---though there are certainly problems, not least of which is the paucity of features on this otherwise crazily intriguing, often baffling little sliver of cinematic grue. Polanski, already in the throes of legal difficulties over his alleged pedophilia in the United States, had fled to France, and the film was shot in French as ""Le Locataire"". Alas, the only DVD you can find of this brutal little gem is dubbed atrociously in English. Polanski, Douglas, and Winters all speak their lines in English, but it's jarring to hear French gens-d'armes barking out Brooklyn-esque brogues, and it takes you completely out of the movie to hear a clearly French waiter's request voiced like an Imperial Stormtrooper from ""Star Wars"".

But these are minor quibbles, and the character of Monsieur Trelkovsky is without question goes down in a fearsome triumvirate of disturbing cinematic cross-dressers, ranked with Norman Bates and Buffalo Bill. For the patient, ""The Tenant"" is a study of cold, congealed horror, and well worth the price of rent.",1098662400,9,5304,5.186915887850467
1735523,4,B000069I09,"This is a great psychological thriller by Roman Polanski, who wisely cast himself into the lead role.  It takes place in Paris at an apartment building where the previous tenant killed herself by jumping off her balcony & breaking her neck.

Trelkovsky (Polanski) is a reclusive guy who hears about the apartment & gladly takes the room.  He slowly gets cold & evil stares by his neighbors & fellow tenants.  He starts to see clues left behind the previous tenant, a tooth in the wall, some Egyptian writing, & articles of clothing.  He after a time, dresses up like her in one scene & talks about how he's pregnant.  He visits Stella (Isabelle Adjani), his friend & lover.

One of the most effective non-Polanski roles would go to Shelley Winters as his landlady, who at first brushes him off like he's lost his marbles, but then becomes more like everyone else there.  Trelkovsky believes that the people are out to get him & wish for him to do the same thing as his previous tenant. He tries to kill himself towards the end, but only breaks his leg, tries again, & succeeds at it then after believing that dying is better than staying in the place any longer.  He really wants to get out of the place, but can't afford to at all.

Roman Polanski masterfully ties in elements of the supernatural throughout the movie, the pace is very slow but not enough to be boring.  The music is perfect for the mood of the flick, as is the camerawork & the casting.  Starring the likes of:  Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas, Jo Van Fleet, & Shelley Winters, it has a strong cast.  The DVD itself is kinda skimpy with only a trailer as the bonus features, but the audio & picture quality is good enough to make up for it.",1094428800,6,1709,4.470967741935484
1735524,5,B000069I09,"When this film came out in 1976, critical reaction was strongly negative. Only one writer I can recall -- Penelope Gilliatt in the New Yorker magazine -- had the insight to see beyond the general weirdness, focusing on the title character's increasing paranoia and alienation. The film could be seen, ultimately, about a man being divorced from his home country, from his friends, from his identity -- even from his gender.

The unnerving plot gets underway when a man named Trelkovsky, played disarmingly by Polanski, moves into a creepy Parisian apartment building, occupying a flat in which the previous tenant committed suicide. Trelkovsky gradually grows suspicious that some of his disgruntled, crabby neighbors would like to see him do the same thing. Part of the unsettling nature of this film is created by the director's skill in methodically escalating the plot, bit by excruciating bit.

In addition to Polanski, the outstanding cast includes Melvyn Douglas, Jo Van Fleet, Shelley Winters and Isabelle Adjani, all seemingly having a great time with a story that is mesmerizing, but granted, may be just too exasperatingly strange for some.  The high production values include gorgeous, moody photography by the great Sven Nykvist (who often photographed for Ingmar Bergman), and an appropriately eerie score by Philippe Sarde. The DVD transfer is beautifully clear.

And then we come to the bizarre, shocking last half-hour or so, and without giving away any of the details, suffice to say that it shows Polanski in a way that few have seen him. For all the attention that ""Chinatown"" gave this director in 1974, this film, coming two years later, is just as striking in a completely different vein.",1093219200,4,1711,5.121863799283154
1735525,1,B000069I09,"I was excited to see this film as I have enjoyed some of Polanski's other works and had heard such great things about what some call the ""scariest movie of all time.""  Unfortunately, my personal experience of ""The Tenant"" has me adding to the dissenting opinion of this forum.
The Tenant is painfully slow, boring, pointless, and devoid of any alleged scares.  Viewers who find the behavior of the main character's cantankerous neighbors ""shocking"" and ""able to drive someone mad"" should move out of the Candyland boardgame and into any modern urban setting where they will find far worse on a daily basis.
Of course Polanski's character goes crazy anyway, for no reason other than to placate those who have been watching for 60 minutes and are still waiting for the film to truly begin.  Conveniently, most all of his many friends and coworkers fail to intervene or even notice his failing mental health.
The first real scare of the movie comes as Polanski applies makeup and ends up looking like a drag queen attempt gone horribly wrong.  Unfortunately, this comes way too late, and those still awake at the end are likely to find the conclusion unexpected, yet ultimately unoriginal and unsatisfying.
For Polanski purists only.",1080691200,7,1230,4.927536231884058
1735526,5,B000069I09,"If only today's mainstream horror/thriller movies could be as twisted as this. This movie is bizzare, I didn't really know what to expect from the description of the movie which said the movie was basically about a guy that rents an apartment where the previous occupant commited suicide.
The main thing that drew me to this movie was that it was directed and starred Roman Polanski, who I've always heard good things about, (except for that pedophile incident he had, that's very bad). He plays a man who tries to be good and never means harm to anyone but his world turns upside down as soon as he gets hassled by his annoying neighbors. Later on he'll be lost in his mind, not knowing who to trust, except for his love interest, the friend of the girl that commited suicide which he meets at the hospital. Story, which is based on some novel, is great because it tells you about the tragedy of a man falling victim to an unfair world. You really see and feel how insane he goes with the good story pacing. Not too much freaky stuff was given in the beginning so the movie progressed well, leaving you with more of an impact from the pyschological mess the main character is in.
There's a few humorous parts but it's mostly dark and dramatic. I highly suggest this film for anyone that wants a horror film with depth. There isn't any gore or graphic violence, just a good old freaky story that will keep you on your seat wandering how the main character will react to all his thoughts, assuming you're not too impatient with story's pacing.",1080172800,4,1542,4.510714285714286
1735527,5,B000069I09,"Undoubtedly one of the most horrifying films I have ever seen, Polanski's ""The Tenant"" ranks as perhaps his overlooked masterpiece.
Polanski plays Monsieur Tarkovsky, a shy introvert (slightly neurotic) who wants nothing more than some meagre lodgings in a rather ugly, creepy apartment building.  God knows why, but it sets up the framework for a really believable, chilling descent into madness.
Tarkovsky is consistently abused, harassed, and put down by both the absurdly stingy landlord (a hideous old man) and his neighbors.  Not only that, it seems that everyone (or is this just his imagination?) sees striking similarities between him and the woman who jumped from the apartment room he is living in.
There are memorable scenes in which he is frantically offered her brand of cigarettes, coffee, etc. Perhaps Polanski wants us to see in Tarkovsky the male echo of the former tenant; perhaps the movie is a reminder of the power of suggestion.  At any rate, it doesn't take long for Tarkovsky to reach breaking point.
Crossdressing (and having an utterly pointless, unbelievable affair with the woman's friend--someone was looped behind the camera), he hallucinates her figure in the apartments across from the building. He finds (or does he?) teeth in the walls, and an array of dresses he is quick to try on. His behavior becomes more and more irrational.  He slaps a child who has a slit in his teeth resembling the woman, he asks to buy a gun at a bar, and at long last withdraws from his obnoxious and ridiculously 'American' friends into a world all his own.  The ending is both predictable and unpredictable, and sometimes strikes one as funny, sometimes as awful.
What I don't understand is why more people aren't aware of this film, as it definitely one of the most powerful pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen. Aside from a few scattered absurd scenes, the entire thing is chillingly believable. I'm not surprised that Polanski himself played Tarkovsky.",1078185600,9,1973,4.984802431610942
1735528,3,B000069I09,"""No One Does It to You like Roman Polanski,"" sure.  But how one is likely to interpret that tagline from Polanski's 1976 film THE TENANT (a.k.a LE LOCATAIRE) depends on which Polanski film is being considered.  If referring to Polanski's 1968 masterpiece ROSEMARY'S BABY, it is easy to assume that the advertisers mean to say that no one SCARES you or DISTURBS you like Polanski.  On the other hand, when regarding THE TENANT, it is tempting to assume that the ad-men might have been using a slang-related double entendre.  Because even though THE TENANT is well acted--Polanski, in the titular role, delivers what is arguably his best acting performance--and despite the fact that the ambiguous plot is both creepy and engaging, the film's conclusion is wholly dissatisfying and anti-climactic.  The questions that Polanski thrusts into the audience's face throughout the movie are left unanswered at the end, and while that vagueness works for the plots of some films, it utterly fails in THE TENANT.  One is left with the feeling that Polanski has behaved like a cinematic bully, taunting the audience with esoteric events and thereby forcing them beg for ultimate clarity, but then pushing them aside at the film's end and exiting the playground without delivering what was tacitly promised.
THE TENANT is a filmic exercise in existentialist paranoia. It begins with the eponymous character, Trelkovsky (Polanski), attempting to rent a Paris apartment that he has heard is now vacant.  As he previews the flat and negotiates rent, he gets snippets of information about the former tenant--a girl who committed suicide by flinging herself out the apartment's only window.  As the film progresses, Trelkovsky learns more and more about his predecessor, and the more he learns, the more obsessed he becomes with the details of her life.  And this obsession eventually leads to Trelkovsky's undoing.
Casual Polanski fans who are expecting THE TENANT to be another CHINATOWN (1974), ROSEMARY'S BABY, or even THE PIANIST (2002) will be sorely disappointed.  Horror fans remembering ROSEMARY'S BABY will enjoy the film's distortion of reality and creepy ambiguity but will likely be disappointed with the conclusion...or lack thereof.  On the other hand, hardcore Polanski aficionados will probably love it from opening scene all the way to closing credits.
As mentioned before, the mostly top-notch acting in THE TENANT is its true redeeming quality.  Polanski is very effective at depicting the mental deterioration of the title character, Trelkovsky, and gorgeous French actress Isabelle Adjani is compellingly bizarre as Stella, Trelkovsky's occasional love--or is it lust?--interest.  Veteran American actor Melvyn Douglas delivers a delightful performance as the landlord, and it's fun to see American actress Shelly Winters in a cameo role as the concierge of the apartment complex.
As is the norm for many Paramount DVDs, the only real bonus item is the film's theatrical trailer.  However, the clear, visually rich widescreen digital transfer indicates that the creation of the disc involved a quality print.
In short, the DVD is well worth the cost for students of cinema and hardcore fans of Polanski.  Those who watch films solely for the enjoyment of good acting may also feel the disc will make a worthy addition to their film collections, but most casual filmgoers will probably be irked by the film's ending and are therefore advised to look elsewhere for movie entertainment.",1077148800,5,3488,5.2594594594594595

As the plot thickens, the motive behind suicide of the former tenant seems to reveal itself to Trelkovsky and it warns him to proceed with caution.

1735530,4,B000069I09,"I recieved this DVD for my birthday last year, and had it sitting on the shelf for a quite a while.  Finally one night I put it in after getting tired of watching predictable movies and got to see one of Polanski's finest attempts at making an original mystery come to life.  All I knew is that it was going to be a ""psychological thriller"" and that he had just made CHINATOWN a year before.  I was amazed to see what he had accomplished with this story.  Polanski stars in it as a new tenant who moves into an apartment building with some of the weirdest and most intriguing characters I've seen in cinema.  Great acting from all of them; it makes me convinced that these people exist somewhere, if not right next to me.  Polanski's talent at slowly bringing in audiences to a story is certainly impressive.  Once the audience is in, the film twists completely and it becomes a roller coaster racing all over the place.  We are desperately trying to hold on as he takes us on a journey on how he is seeing these people through his mind.  With Isabelle Adjanti acting out a strange role other than her ""sad and beautiful"" typical characters, I found myself appreciating her acting more than ever.  The imagery in this film is some of the best I've seen, and the music makes it a work of art.  There were times where I would play a scene over and over again because of the mix of music and visuals.  When the film is over, it made me want to see it again because as usual, Polanski leaves the audience with letting US decide what really happened.  The key to watching this film is letting yourself fall into what he showing you---not trying to predict what will happen...because you won't believe the final outcome.",1072569600,9,1714,4.437699680511182

Two - having seen this once on VHS, I thought just for the hell of it I would try watching the French dub on the off chance that it would be the one made for the French first-run release. It is, and let me tell you, folks - the social humor that comes off as rather heavy-handed in the English version becomes subtle, muted and sardonic. The regional Parisian colloquialisms immeasurably enhance the film's atmosphere and authenticity. Sure, there are American actors in the film, we don't get to hear their voices, but that's all right as Polanski gives a fine rendition of his role in French and the actors dubbing the rest of the cast acquit themselves extraordinarily well. I am nominally a purist about foreign language dubs as a rule - meaning I don't watch them as they generally vitiate the unique character of a film. However, ""The Tenant"" is a French film in all but the particulars of its completion and release for American audiences. It used a French studio, French actors and technicians, and is thusly as sharp an evocation of the damp, mouldy side of Paris as has ever been seen in pictures. For these reasons, the French dub seems to me to improve on the original - superb as that track is, don't get me wrong. But I hope you won't just take my word for it - to see ""The Tenant"" in French is a unique viewing experience.",1066953600,2,1443,4.368029739776952

Yes, Polanski had sex with an underage girl, however the underage girl and the mother have always maintained that the sex was consensual and therefore Polanski while being a pedophile(not pedephile) is not a rapist. That being said, this is one of the greatest films to ever be produced. I saw it only once in 1978 and I am still telling people that they need to see it.",1066176000,4,579,4.471698113207547

A Russian man in Paris rents an apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. This gentleman, like you and I, does not ""comprehend suicide"" so he wonders why the girl had jumped to death. As he convinces himself that he'll  never meet the fate that awaited his predecessor in the apartment, his paranoia very gradually takes over as he finds quaint neighbors.
Was it loneliness? Was it an egregious fear of NOT wanting to turn out like the previous tenant? Whatever the reason, the movie soon takes on contours of blurring the Reality with the Imagined, and it is very, very scary. I checked on the cover twice during the movie to make sure it wasn't ""horror.""
Frankly, the first time I was just plain scared and even felt gyped at the end. But I bet if you watch it again, you too will notice some nuance that escaped you first time round.

1735536,5,B000069I09,"I rarely get confused after finishing a movie or when trying to consider it in a small conversation with other viewers. This one really confused me.
The film is about solitude of a human being in a tough world, beautifully describing how easy you may plunge in mayhem, without drawing the compassion of any person. Hence, the final act that you would commit might eventually -and falsely- draw the loathing of others, as a last and unique gesture of compassion.
There is no real scenario in the film; it is made of sequenced sketches picturing the life of very ordinary person. There is a suicide of a beautiful girl, to reach her deformed body and pathetic end on the bed of the hospital. There is another beautiful girl, who chooses to keep running, like burning time will give you a lighter pain. There is a friend, with strong attitude and confidence, but his non-human approach is not an idol. Finally, there is the principal character pushed by this great emptiness to... anything available.
Yet, you are anxious to reach the extent where the blow of all the frustration is coming: being the end of the mayhem (Polanski choose a violent death in this case). And albeit everything was presented in a tragic way, you still have a comic feeling about silliness, a silliness that unfortunately may end by a death.
It was possible to avoid that death, by finding a suitable and ordinary lover, a nice neighbor or an understanding friend that can give you time; but the movie was picturing the extremist, the status where the human soul couldn't make it.
This movie is almost identical with Taxi Driver; however, the reaction of the frustrated human took a different, more optimistic -yet more American- phase there.
It is one of the rare movies that strongly motivate you, get you scared of what could happen or confidence that you are ""doing well"". Do not miss it.",1063411200,5,1866,4.726993865030675
1735537,5,B000069I09,"In CHINATOWN, Polanski gave us a great story of corruption. In ROSEMARY'S BABY, he studied the occult. In REPULSION, he gave us a portrait of a troubled mind. Here, in THE TENANT, Roman Polanski gives us a stunning new portrayal of absolute paranoia.
Polanski stars himself as the main character: a man who rents the apartment of a dead woman - who apparently jumped from her window.
Strangely enough, Polanski's character starts to identify with the dead woman little by little as he starts to live in the same environment... the same apartment, the same neighbours, the same window, the same talk... and - guess what! - maybe she did not commit suicide after all...
But this is just the beginning. To reveal more, it would be unthinkable.
Why is this a great film? A first rate screenplay (beautifully constructed), amazing actors (Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas are great!), and...
...The sets! The bulding (a parisian quartier) is absolutely fantastic. Like REAR WINDOW, it was entirely built in a sound stage - incredible!!! - allowing Mr. Polanski enough freedom to put the camera wherever he wanted.
But the great thing about this film is that (like in a state of paranoia) you never know what is truth or what is imagined. The main character starts to see, hear and discover things that may actually be true! - only at the end (with a finalle that makes perfect sense) you'll discover the truth behind it all.
After those beautiful sets, comes the cinematography by one of the top Directors of Photography: Sven Nykvist (PERSONA, CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, ANOTHER WOMAN, CRIES AND WHISPERS, AUTUMN SONATA, and many other works)... this film has one of the best studio cinematographies I have ever seen. The music is also beautiful and you will love it from the moment it begins. Also a great achevement is sound design.
This is one of those great films where mood and atmosphere set an exemple for what to do in a film - a work where everything is right.
Unfortunately, the DVD only comes with the trailer (which is also beautiful). No photos, no commentary (I was hoping this DVD would come with a commentary by Mr. Polanski), not even a small interview with anybody. Too bad if you consider the quality of the craftsmanship of this work.

There are directors that I think are good. Good story tellers at least. Rob Reiner, Ron Howard, Richard Donner fit into this category. They are going to give you a straight, good story. They typically don't take big risks. Then there are the elites. They can tell great stories but their work is on another level. David Lynch, David Fincher, Christopher Nolan, Stanley Kubrick, among others. I would put Roman Polanski in with the elites. And like the elites not every Polanski film is pure perfection. While I liked most of ""The Tenant"" I didn't love all of it. When a movie exceeds the hour and a half mark I start to ask if it was necessary for the movie to be any longer. I'm not saying that a movie can't be longer to be good but I want a movie to make a profound point or have essential story elements or incredible pacing to earn much time beyond it. ""The Tenant"" didn't do any of these things and really started to drag. More to the point, I almost couldn't pay attention any longer making some of the final scenes and sequences daunting to watch. I must admit that I had to rewind quite a bit. It pains me to say it too because I really like Polanski's work. I like the kind of story teller he is where the main character is central and proactive. Nobody does this better than him. His signature style is all over ""The Tenant"" but it couldn't make the movie hit the heights of greatness.

Like David Lynch's ""Lost Highway"" the film ends with an impression of an infinite loop or a mobius strip as its conclusion. As a young aspiring writer I used to LOVE this kind of thing. Now, as I'm older and have watched more movies, told more stories, lived through the nineties LOL, these types of endings don't settle well with me any longer. They feel to me like the author couldn't come up with a satisfying conclusion so they go this route for some reason. I'd prefer an abrupt, meaningless ending to be honest. A good example might be Kubrick's ""The Shining."" When it ends you want to know what ""The Shining"" was all about and the main character is just frozen in time starring at you from within the old painting. Now THIS is doing it right! You are left to make your own conclusion(s). ""Were we seeing something play out over and over like an infinite?"" Maybe. ""Was it the spirits of the hotel pulling him into the past with them?"" Perhaps. It gives the movie perpetual rewatchability. That's not the case with ""The Tenant."" It's just a loop. May as well have just said he was crazy because that would have been as satisfying. The irony is that Polanski does not want that cut and dry of a conclusion. Why not? It's better than this silly loop. Don't get me wrong. I'm aware the movie is setting this up the whole time and makes the ending necessary but I could have gleaned that (and did BTW) without the ending. I think it would have been better off with him dead in the courtyard and getting a standing ovation from the denizens of the complex.

Like the elites Polanski is not afraid to ask big questions. They seem almost obligatory for film makers like him. For this he asks where is the ""you?"" Definitely a profound question. There is an assumption that you may speak possessively about your arm if it is detached but what about your head? Where does the possession settle? The assumption is that ""you"" is synonymous with your body. Well that's not necessarily true. In philosophy this is called the ""mind-body problem."" The mind-body Duellists would simply ask ""why assume the 'you' resides within the physical?"" His question had to do with the tooth. Perhaps the person in question has a right over the tooth. How impactful was this on the story? Not nearly enough I'd say. It could have been cut and you would have missed nothing. It's too bad too because this is the problem I really have with this movie. If you are going to ask great questions then go all the way and make them integral to the plot.

Along with some pointless scenes with friends who are very annoying, the movie's pacing is drug down by many of these issues. By themselves I actually like almost all of the scenes in the film but when put together they are just sort of there.

Now I probably sound like I hate the film but actually it has some redeemable qualities. First, even though the pacing is slow and boring the sense that this is going somewhere is replete throughout the movie. You never feel lost or like he has nowhere to go with his ideas (or the book's ideas). Also there are some truly creepy scenes. I felt uncomfortable and sat up and took note at these scenes. They were the closest I've been to being scared by a movie since I was a kid which is quite an accomplishment. It may look like I have given only a small paragraph as a compliment compared to my criticisms but I really LOVED these scenes and it made it worth the watch. Plus there were many such scenes.

7965890,3,B000069I09,"Firstly, this movie is dubbed and is much worse off for it. A man (Polanski) rents the apt of a woman who is not expected to live. When he lies to the woman's friend who is also visiting her, we realize all may not be well with Polanski. While the apt. is somewhat of a dump with the bathroom down the hall, noisey plumbing, and comes with a very unfriendly landlord and wacky neighbors, it seems the apt. Is a rare find and he's very pleased with it. At first Polanski appears pretty normal, diffident and unassuming. He's sympathetic at times, especially when he asserts himself and refuses to sign a petition against a neighbor with a handicapped child. This movie is a portrayal of a man who may or may not be losing his mind, or maybe it's neither. While it has created to perfection its camerawork and mood setting, I found it slow moving and mostly nonsensical. For instance why is Polanski spying with binoculars on tenants mysteriously standing perfectly still outside the apt. bathroom (whose wall is covered hieroglyphics)? It leaves a lot to the imagination.",1501977600,,1070,4.666666666666667
7965891,5,B000069I09,Polanski remakes Repulsion set in a bleak grey Paris full of racist French friends/neighbours/colleagues of paranoid cross-dressing Polish weirdo played by Roman himself.
