7980771,3,B000089RTL,"The description of the movie by Variety  included here pretty  much sums  up the plot; if you can call it a plot.  This movie was a little distracting with so many things going on and in the end it really wasn't important to follow all the details because the roads lead nowhere.  Maybe that is the point. The screenplay won an award in Spain, a Goya( an Oscar equivilent) for best screenplay and was nominated and garnished another award for best new actor. These accolades aside the movie was a bit of a disappointment in that many isues were never resolved . The movie deals with the pitfalls of a rock and roll lifestyle with emphasis on sex, drugs  and compromising one's artistic integrity for commercial success, wealth and recognition.  At one point the band is compared to a contemporary real Spanish singer and they are dismayed by the ""compliment."" The  acting is top notch and presents characters that are credible with the result being that you become engulfed with the problems of this band. As you watch the movie and the story line continues you will want to know if the problems will work out and by  the end of the movie you will still be wondering many of the same things. The movie depicts the rock and roll lifestyle in a  manner  that is neither glamorous nor sordid but rather  a combination of the two ; as in real life nothing is as it seems in black and white but in shades of grey. When the movie comes to  a halt you may find yourself surprised that ended and react as I did and say, ""that's it""! It is entertaining but not as good as I had anticipated since it had won several awards.  In the end this movie is much like life itself  that has many unresolved issues left in the past as we move on  in this journey. Not bad, not great,  this movie is just a tad better than average.",1073952000,2,1810,4.3552238805970145
