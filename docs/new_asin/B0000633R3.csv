7958320,5,B0000633R3,"This is a must have for all Menudo and El Reencuentro Fans. You will be transported to the land of happiness. Great quality images and sound. Again, a must!",1186012800,,156,4.413793103448276
7958321,5,B0000633R3,"The is the ultimate Ricky Martin video collection! I suggest it for anyone who's a pre-Grammy fan and post-Grammy fan. If you want to get a true meaning of who this entertainer is this DVD is for you.

I loved seeing his videos from A Medio Vivir and Vuelve. There were even one or two I hadn't seen before. The only tiny gripe I have is that the video for El Amor De Mi Vida was not included in this collection (although the song IS on the La Historia CD).

The interviews included were great as well. Gives the fan a chance to see Ricky in rare form.

I would suggest this DVD to anyone who considers themself a fan of this artist. A must have for your Ricky Martin collection!",1153785600,4,679,4.1679389312977095
7958322,5,B0000633R3,"I loved this DVD< it's absoulutely Awesome!, All his best videos, Excellent!. Also the bonus footage which is a collage of Ricky Martin is really great & exciting to watch. I highly reccomend this if you are a fan of Ricky Martins Spanish Music.",1070064000,5,245,4.590909090909091
7958323,5,B0000633R3,"This DVD includes videos for Te Extrano, Fuego de Noche, and other older Spanish-language Ricky Martin hits that are difficult or even impossible to see otherwise in the U.S. The videos are of good quality and there are quite a few, although I think that the inclusion of Maria and Vuelve is somewhat redundant, as they also appear on the Ricky Martin Video Collection. There are also a few songs I would have liked to see videos for, such as Fuego Contra Fuego. All in all, however, this is a good collection.",1018224000,5,510,4.554347826086956
7958324,3,B0000633R3,"Just got my copy...was disappointed . Granted, it was interesting to see the Spanish videos that I hadn't seen before ( the videos released prior to ""Vuelve"" ) but the rest of it, major Ricky fans probably have already seen . I was hoping for some concert footage . Our boy really has to release some new material .",1015372800,2,315,4.3559322033898304
