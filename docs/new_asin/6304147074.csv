798815,3,6304147074,"23. MANIAC (horror, 1980) A killer stalks the streets of New York City. He brutally kills women and takes their scalps (along with other articles) as souvenirs. The Maniac (Joe Spinell) uses the scalps to put on mannequins he  has all over his dingy, claustrophobic apartment. His fixation with these  lifeless puppets is the only real link between him and the outside world.  He nonetheless meets, on a friendly basis, a beautiful photographer  (Caroline Munro). Just when you think he has reformed, the maniac turns  against her in a psychotic rage.
Critique: A truly gruesome, sick  picture makes other of its kind pale in comparison. The film creates a  terribly real, decadent look of what evil beings are really up to. The  locales of rubbish infected alleyways, deserted parks, stations and so on  is truly nerve-wracking. This study into the mind of a serial killer is  given 'weight' by Joe Spinell's considerable performance. His sweaty,  sex-obsessed pervert can't help himself from committing such horrid murders  (after each kill he laments and moans for not being able to sedate his sick  urges). Like others of his ilk, he suffers constant mental disillusions and  schizophrenic flashbacks. Film is very disturbing even when it's trying to  be natural, and definitely not for the faint minded.",917913600,13,1308,5.10377358490566

798925,5,6304147074,"There are so many great slashers of the 1980's and Maniac is definitely one of several.  This movie isn't just another awesome showcase of the great Tom ""Sex Machine"" Savini's brilliant gore effects but a well thought out masterpiece.  It did indeed give Savini another great slasher to be involved with in 1980 besides Friday the 13th.

The movie focuses on a severely psychotic and traumatized Norman Bates like serial killer named Frank Zito.  Frank has nightmares, carries a torch for his sick mother, lives alone, has several mannequins surrounding him, is possibly schizophrenic, and has an arsenal of weapons at his finger tips.  The momma's boy serial killer moves about Manhattan and the rest of New York City stalking beautiful women to not only kill but scalp and put their scalps on top of his mannequins heads.

Frank's weapons of choice are a double -barrellled shotgun, a switch blade, and a bayonet.

Some facts about the film:  It was directed and co-produced by William Lustig. It was also produced by Andrew W. Garroni.  Joe Spinell co-wrote it with C.A. Rosenberg, developed the story, and of course Joe played the lead character of Frank Zito.  The musical Score is by Jay Chattaway.  Cinematography is by Robert Lindsay.  It was distributed by Analysis Film Releasing Corporation.  It was released in New York City on December 26, 1980 and got a limited release in the rest of North America on March 6, 1981.  It's filming dates were from between October 21 1979-January 1980.  It's estimated budget was $350,000. Finally it grossed $6,000,000 in the U.S.

This movie gives way to awesome and realistic gore effects via Savini, some good nudity, beautiful cinematography, especially the effective dark and dreary scenes, also there are some beautiful scenes and great colors.  The beach scene and the subway scene are a couple of examples of this.  The kill scenes are wonderfully edited as well.  Frank ""Maniac"" Zito is a considerably complex character in that on one hand you might hate him for killing innocent beautiful women, on the other hand you might feel sympathy towards him for being such a momma's boy whose mother is dead and who can't help but be severely twisted and psychotic, yet on another hand he can come off like a charming and nice guy.  These complexities about Frank make him an incredibly interesting character overall.  That campy pop song Showdown is likely to stay inside your head long after the movie, even if you don't want it to.  The tension involving what Frank will do to his victims plus the occasional uncertainty of when he will snap prove quite exhilarating.  Joe Spinell's performance is undeniably briiliant and flawless.  He not only stays in character perfectly, but he manages to balance the dichotomy of going from insane to seemingly normal at first without a hitch.  At no time did he ham his performance much less make you doubt that his character is severely deranged.

Overall, If you're looking for some awesome gore created by the brilliant Tom ""Sex Machine"" Savini, some good nudity, an interesting plot, a complex killer, excellent cinematography, perfect edits and pacing, intense scenes of stalking and killing, a brilliant performance by the late Joe Spinell, an atmospheric and at times feeling of isolation, and just an all around masterpiece of an early 80's slasher film than this movie is definitely for you.  10 stars out of 10.",1465776000,,3413,4.942105263157894

798999,4,6304147074,"Meet Frank Zito (the positively awesome Joe Spinell) a mercilessly brutal psychopath whos haunted to no avail by the memory of a hellacious childhood at the hands of his sadistic and abusive mother.
Tormented by these past events, Frank is compelled to prowl the seedy streets of the big apple under the cover of night where he stalk and subsequently slaughters a wide variety of the cities female inhabitants, with the dual purposes of calming the voices in his head and furthermore claiming their scalps so he can accessorise the large collection of mannequins he has stashed in his seedy low rent apartment.
But when he meets the beautiful photographer Anna (Caroline Munro) while out scoping for potential victims and finds that she shows an interest in him, Frank begins to contemplate if he might be able to break out of the maddening cycle of violence which up until this point has been centre of his existence.
But despite his best efforts to reform, his vile compulsions remain and whats worse the longer he abstains from the perverse impulses roaming in his mind, the more desperate and unravelled he ultimately become. So while his newfound ladyfriend Anna seems to suspects nothing, this human monster in turn, grows more and more frantic by the absence of blood.

William Lustigs Maniac weren't greeted with much in the way of love or enthusiasm, when it slithered down the pike in 1980 where it was outright dismissed by critics as a sickening and vile exploitation film, with little to nothing on offer other than a misogynistic, mean-spirited attitude and desensitizing gory set pieces, and to be perfectly honest youd probably be hard-pressed to find a film that is more gleefully eager to embrace all the lurid traits or credentials, commonly associated with exploitation genre as a whole, so in those terms if nothing else I guess it wholeheartedly succeeds. Luckily, over the last three decades Maniac has enjoy an immense cult following from people who appreciates its many qualities and is now rightfully being hailed as one of the very best hard core horror offerings from the early 80s and make no mistake about it (damning review, be damned!) Maniac is indeed one of the finest pieces of sleaze ever produced.

The seamy atmosphere that pervades Lustigs film is extremely effective in helping to covey the story of the tormented lone scalper and every nuance of it, be it the neon lit city streets or the killers mannequin packed apartment is brilliantly captured by cinematographer Robert Lindsay under Lustigs watchful eye. It all feels gloriously dirty, soiled and sweltering gritty.
The cityscape of New York City (pre-Giuliani cleanup) is the sort of crack-ridden hellhole; tailor made for a film whose sole focus seems to be on the depiction of social and mental decay. Just like Abel Ferraras Driller Killer (1979) its the kind of movie that makes you want to take a cleansing shower immediately after sampling it.
However, the end-all-be-all in terms of the greatness that is Maniac can undoubtedly be credited to the monumental presence of one Joe Spinell (who also co-wrote and produced) as his take on the brooding psycho is nothing short of brilliant. His portrayal is at once maniacal and oddly childish but never less then terrifying, he doesn't so much portray the character as he completely engulfs it and its hard to imagine any other actor delivering a more committed or captivating performance.

The gore on display is lavish in quantity, with the most impressive set piece being the infamous head shot sequence. All credit for effectiveness on show in that specific scene and for that matter all the other shots of bloodshed and gory mayhem on order must goes to the recipient of the abovementioned hail of bullets, that being effects wizard Tom Savini, whose little cameo as the womanising disco boy (who ultimately finds himself headless) is the films splattery highpoint.
The frequent POV shots combined with the constant heavy breathing (ala Michael Myers) dominating the soundscape likewise adds to the sense of tension and dread of the piece, as does the wonderful atmospheric score by Jay Chattaway, who also did the brilliant music for one of my personal favourites, the werewolf feature Silver Bullet (Daniel Attias,1985)

But Im afraid I cant be convinced to dabble out that elusive fifth star, due to the simple fact that for all its qualities maniac is still at heart pure exploitation cinema and therefore largely superficial by design and while I personally love the movie I also categorically believe that every film regardless of genre needs to evoke a sense of wonderment and a need for further exploration of its subject matter in the audience to truly be considered a classic and in that regard Maniac is simply too simplistic in its hack n slash mentality to qualify.
However that doesnt mean that the film isn't a cornerstone in the annals of horror history and one of the movie titles that no genre aficionado can do without.

Reviewed here is the brilliant Collectors Tin box limited to 5000 copies worldwide that Anchor Bay released in 2001 of which this is number 3968.
Presented digitally THX Mastered and uncut in its entirety with an 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen picture and Dolby Digital Surround Ex, 6.1 DTS-ES, and 2.0 Dolby Surround tracks, both picture and soundtrack are a beautiful representation of the violent and sleazy antics on screen.
In the extras department we have a very funny and informative commentary track with William Lustig, FX specialist Tom Savini, Editor Lorenzo Marinelli and Joe Spinells (R.I.P.) assistant Luke Walker. Radio Interview with William Lustig, Joe Spinell & Caroline Munroe, Best of all though, is the touching and earnest documentary The Joe Spinell Story which runs 49 Minutes and gives and incredible insight into the madman that was Joe Spinell told by the people who knew and loved him. Its an incredible watch and in my opinion one of the very best DVD extras ever produced. Theatrical Trailers, TV Spots, Radio Spots, Poster & Still Gallery and Talent Bios round off the packaged and to top it all off, the aptly titled Gallery of Outrage which is a composite of the most hyperbolic cries of anger and denouncement directed at the film from the reviewers of the time. Its a fabulous - laugh a minute - read.
Exclusive to the tin box is the movies beautiful score on a separate compact disc, cut out in the shape of Joe Spinells head.",1435449600,3,6454,4.93376264949402

799188,5,6304147074,"The film opens with a young couple lying on a beach by themselves in the early hours of the morning it seems. The girlfriend sends her boyfriend off to get more wood for a fire they had. While he's off picking up sticks around the deserted beach site, the young girl is suddenly murdered, having her throat slashed by an unseen man who was spying on the couple. Upon returning with the wood and finding only his girlfriend's bloody shirt left behind, the young guy is attacked from behind by the killer and killed with piano wire.

The film then suddenly cuts to a man by the name of Frank Zito who awakens in bed in a cold night sweat after having a nightmare. Some time later that night in the city of Manhattan, Frank is out for a walk when he encounters two hookers standing in front of a seedy, rundown hotel. One of the prostitutes asks Frank if he wants to go on a ""date"" so he takes her inside the hotel and pays for a room. Frank and the hooker have sex and things seem fine at first until Frank snaps and strangles the hooker to death.

From there he goes on a murderous rampage, killing innocent young women around the city followed by scalping them and placing them on the heads of mannequins he owns in his apartment. Soon after he begins dating a beautiful photographer named Anna and for awhile, Frank seems to be a normal, decent human being. But he still has a deep urge to kill any woman he comes across. It turns out that Frank's need to kill women stems from past childhood memories that haunt him. Can he overcome his desire to kill and face his haunting childhood past or will his murderous ways take over his mind, body, and soul?

Overall: The 1980s was without a doubt the decade of the slasher films. But out of all the slashers that I've seen from the 80s, none of them are as violent and gruesome as Maniac. Okay I'm lying. The Burning was pretty violent. Please correct me if I'm wrong. While this isn't an all out gore fest of a film, it's pretty bloody. Many of the murder scenes in this film are excruciating and if you easily get squeamish, I don't know if you'd enjoy this very much. The legendary Joe Spinell--God rest his soul, wrote the script and starred in this film and offers up an extraordinary performance as the deranged and psychotic Frank Zito. At times they intentionally or unintentionally do a good job and making you feel slightly sympathetic for Frank as he's so lost in his mind, he feels bad for killing women and probably doesn't even realize or understand what he's really or done or the fact that he is a maniac (pun intended). Overall, if you're a fan of old school 80s slasher films, you'll enjoy Maniac.",1421971200,,2662,4.395537525354969

yes an extremely Graphic & Disturbing Horror film about a serial killer that Murders innocent women
co-written by Actor Joe spinell who also plays the lead role in this film as serial killer Frank zito
who is Haunted by the traumas of his childhood abuse
and when the Horrific memories begin to happen inside his mind he goes on a killing spree in New york city

exceptionally Great performance by Joe spinell who was also Executive producer on the film
in some scenes where he acts out Disturbing Psychological problems of his Character
Actress Caroline munro plays Joe's Girlfriend in the film, Great acting by Caroline munro to
also brilliantly Directed by William Lustig
the films storyline is hugely inspired by serial killers from the 70's & 60's that have been sexual abused
 or Physically abused as a child
the killing/Murder scenes are very Graphic some are hard to watch for sure
i do love Horror films i'm a big fan of the Halloween films & Freddy krueger's Nightmare on elm st
but for this particular Horror film Tom savini's special Blood & Gore effects were that realistic
i had to fast forward some scenes that were to just to Graphic
especially the Graphic Head scalping scene which is one of the Highlights of the film
the women actress's that are seemed to be murdered in the film are mainly porn actress'es
that had be starring in Adult films during 1975-1980

well the Distributor of this film BLUE UNDERGROUND
have now released this on Blu-ray advertised as 30TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION
 with a new High Definition transfer in 1:85:1 widescreen & a new 7.1 Master audio mix aswell as a 5.1 surround sound mix
i tell you what the picture quality looks very sharp & clear for sure
and the new 7.1 master mix, what a boost in the sound quality
much better than the 2 Disc set from years ago
i'm also happy to say that all the special features from the 2 Disc DVD set have been carried over to this blu-ray to
ANNA AND THE KILLER Retrospective interview with Caroline munro
THE DEATH DEALER, retrospective interview with Tom savini
DARK NOTES interview with Jay chattaway who did the music score
MANIAC publicity featurette
MANIAC controversy featurette

the JOE SPINELL STORY the 50mins Documentary on Joe spinell's life is also included in this blu-ray case
but on a 2nd DVD Disc
an excellent 50mins for some fans of Joe spinell or this MANIAC film
interviews with Caroline munro, William Lustig, Tom savini, Luke walter, Joe spinell's mother
some of Joe's work colleague's from other films that Joe had a Acting role
Joe's film Maniac is talked about in Great detail alot of Great personal stories are shared
an emotional Doco to especially when his Death is talked about

for some reason this 50min Doco was not added to the blu-ray Disc which i think there was more than enough room
for another 50mins of Data on 1 Blu-ray Disc
so even thou this blu-ray does no advertise as being 2 Disc set, there's a 2nd Disc included in the blu-ray case

Joe spinell tragically Died in January 1989, read wikipedia about his Death
i loved his Acting roles, Joe was a Great performance/Character Actor & a Great film writer
but very unfortunate never got the respect & recognition he Deserved as an Actor
he had some Great acting roles before Maniac,
Joe had a small part as Rocky's best friend in ROCKY II which he had alot of screen time to show his talent
Joe was also in the Godfather II & Sylvester stallone's Nighthawks where he plays the Police lieutenant
i guess not all Great performances Actors will get the respect they Deserve in the Acting business
i guess some very Good Actors do fall through the cracks.
tragically Joe was one of them

if you have the old 2 Disc DVD set,
Blue underground re-issued the film on blu-ray again in 2012 but with out the Joe spinell Documentary
and Different cover art to
so time to upgrade & get the 30th Anniversary blu-ray version which has very Good clear sharp picture quality

Mr. Spinell plays the character so well that you really get to see every aspect of the Maniac's tortured personality. It says a lot when a character like this can make you fear him, feel repulsed by him and yet still feel sorry for him.  Of course, when the goremaster, Tom Savini, is involved with any film, I'm there in the front row with my popcorn and Coke with a big grin on my face. Tom's demise in the film is what the kids would call ""EPIC"". You can't really call yourself a fan of horror without Maniac in your collection, and Blue Underground did it right with their release.

Joe Spinell plays the main character, The Maniac, in the film.
He wanders the streets and underground for victims to kill using knives and other sharp weapons and then systematically scalps them and keeps their hair to dress manikins that he keeps in his bedroom.
Joe's performance as a deranged killer is believable and helps the viewer in connecting with his horrible acts of murder and mutilation on his female victims.

799368,3,6304147074,"This old chestnut from 1980 is worth revisiting for fans of the old school violent and gore-filled horror films of yesterday. It's a movie that is an experiment in how much violence and sadism can be actually put on screen. It has a lot more in common with Italian exploitation and slasher films of the 1980's than any American slasher film ever made. It's like the Lucio Fulci film, The New York Ripper in a lot of ways... unapologetic in its violence and the murder scenes are quite realistic. The story is slow in places and quite brisk in others. It tries to be very psychological but is overwhelmed by sheer brutality.

This may be what actor Joe Spinell is best remembered for. Worth it if you are a slasher horror fan.",1393977600,,725,4.492424242424242

A mentally disturbed man goes on a killing spree and tries
to stop. The late, Spinell (Rocky) was great in this because
he was not only creepy, but you felt a little sympathy for
his character. He & Munro (The Spy Who Loved Me) also
had good chemistry and Tom Savini did great with the
make-up effects as usual. This Blu-ray has good picture

799371,4,6304147074,"This is a rough movie. Unlike most slasher movies up until Maniac, you don't stray very far from inside the killers mind. Other horror movies explore the mystery angle, tracking the killer from the police POV up until the big reveal at the film's climax. Psycho had shifting points of views and perspectives (including the victim' and killer's point of view during the shower scene).

Maniac never moves far from the main character Frank Zito and his deeply disturbed psychosis. Adding to that, there is not much of a storyline and that's what makes this movie unpopular to alot of people. The sparse script makes the movie seem like just a string of grotesque murder scenes and not much else. The movie does have a storyline but it is strictly about Zito, his past abuses by his mother and his rapid descent into total madness. There is a light subplot involving Zito and Anna D'Antoni played by Caroline Munro but it doesn't come across well.  Much of the movie is from Zito's point of view and when it wasn't from his POV it was the POV of his victims.

The film itself is extremely cold and that looks to be by design. Lustig shot the film in the dead of winter entirely in NYC. Winter heightens the sense of isolation of the main character and his victims. The weather serves as a suitable metaphor for Zito's actions. The movie is cold and disturbing from the first frame of the film on.

People uninitiated with Joe Spinell will be happy to know that he is just a very talented actor and nowhere near the character he portrays in this film. Spinell was not only not abused by his mother, he lived with her well into his 40's until she passed away. It was even believed he committed suicide because of the depression he felt over her death.

I believe this is Spinell's first and only real starring role in his career (you can count&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Horror-Film-Uncut-Special-Edition/dp/B001SGEUH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Horror Film (Uncut Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;which reunites Munro with Spinell but that's more of a horror comedy/spoof). He was responsible for the story, much of the production and he didn't even take a salary (he claimed only a percentage of the profits as payment). Spinell is a grossly underrated actor. The Anchor Bay edition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maniac/dp/B00ECTH2D8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maniac</a>&nbsp;contains a lengthy documentary on Spinell. I recommend that edition more than the 30th anniversary edition.

This movie achieves what it sets out to do. Disturb the hell out of you. It achieves this thanks to excellent makeup work by Tom Savini, William Lustig's directing (and with a small budget) and Joe Spinell who is almost too believable as the serial killer Frank Zito.

Abide by the ratings system with this one because this is definitely not recommended for children or old ladies",1387238400,,2970,5.226890756302521

The DVD translation is very well done, although I much rather my Blu-ray edition with way more extras. This is a slasher like I have never seen before. Very different in a lot of ways. The gore scenes are fantastic and the movie had me scared quite a few times. I especially love the scenes with the nurse. The acting is ok, but some things are questioned. Why would the lead girl welcome this total stranger into her house and act like they just became such good best friends. That wasn't very convincing to me.

799376,4,6304147074,"Joe Spinell did an excellent job in this. He plays the role to perfection. He's creepy, as we imagine serial killers to be (though they really aren't in real life). The actor was close to middle age and not very attractive, so unlike what casting directors are looking for these days.

Frank is such a pitiful mess. He's abnormally obsessed with this mother, which I'm sure was modeled after Norman Bates. He talks to mannequins as if they're real, he cries softly to himself and rocks back and forth, as mental patients will do, has delusions, ect.

My favorite death scene is with the man in his car. Graphic violence at its finest. I didn't like the nonsense during the last part and that's why this gets 4 stars/B from me.",1381190400,,726,4.534351145038168

799489,5,6304147074,"Okay so yes, Maniac is considered a slasher, but it is so much more. The film dives deep within the psyche of a serial killer, who really doesn't want to hurt anybody, however he can't control himself; due to schizophrenia and bad memories of his mother. We actually like him and we don't want to see him die, he's much like Larry Talbot from The Wolf Man (1941). We want to see him over come his troubles, but we know it's not going to end well for him. This is why Maniac works on so many levels. Sure, there's buckets of blood & gore, but what really sucks us in for repeated viewings, are the characters. The story, dialogue, and characters, are so well done and gripping, that you're drawn into (Joe Spinell) Frank Zito's world. Everybody involved does a fantastic job. The effects by Tom Savini look great (dated by today's standards, but still shocking & well crafted), the actors pump fuel into the characters which brings them to life, the score is brilliant, and the cinematography is top notch. Let's dig deeper shall we...

Story: Frank Zito as a young boy was abused by his mother & born with schizophrenia. Now older, his mother died in a car accident, and Frank has begun to lose his mind. He keeps a room full of mannequins, which he talks to and dresses up, with the scalps of his female victims. Frank battles his inner demons, and nearly loses it. Until he meets a lovely photographer, who keeps him from going insane...FOR NOW!

Cast:
Frank Zito - Joe Spinell
Anna - Caroline Munro
Special appearance by Tom Savini
including others.

Maniac holds your attention, and never lets go. The film has some really creepy atmosphere which is complimented by the grimy-dark streets of New York City. The haunting score embraces you with a mellow start, and slowly builds. Tensions mount and suspense keeps pumping. The characters are fleshed out deeply, and our protagonist/antagonist keeps us interested. Upon release Maniac was made controversial, it was boycotted, and even banned in some areas. Maniac is a film that lives up to its controversy. Many tend to disregard Maniac, as another cheap slasher flick, but in reality it's a brilliant and impressive film.
Maniac is probably one of my favorite films of all time, it is that good!

Fun Facts: An remake was made in 2012, which was surprisingly good (but not as great as the original). Many scenes had to be filmed guerrilla-style because the production could not afford city permits. The infamous shotgun sequence was one of them; it was filmed in just an hour. The filming began on October 21st 1979 and was finished on January 18th 1980. Savini got the part of the male shotgun victim because he had already made a cast of his own head. He then filled the head with leftover food from lunch and fired live ammunition at it. Immediately after firing the shotgun, Savini threw it into the trunk of a waiting car driven by a friend of Spinell's, an assistant named Luke Walter, so they could avoid being caught by police. Spinell planned to make a sequel entitled Mr. Robbie, a remake of the 1973 film The Psychopath, about a children's television host who murders the abusive parents of his fans. A short promotion film was made in 1986 which was filmed, produced and directed by Buddy Giovinazzo and written by Spinell and Joe Cirillo, but Spinell was unable to find financial backers. Portions can been seen on the latest 30th Anniversary DVD release. After nearly three years, financing was indeed raised and it was scheduled to go into production in March 1989, but the sudden death of Spinell two months prior cancelled all plans for the sequel. Spinell and co-star Caroline Munro went on to work together again in The Last Horror Film in 1982. Maniac was nominated for a Saturn Award by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, USA, for Best Low-Budget Film in 1981. An extract of dialogue from the film's trailer was sampled on the song ""Frank Zito, The Maniac"" by metal band Frightmare on their album Midnight Murder Mania.
Death rapper Necro recorded a song titled ""Frank Zito"" on his album Brutality Part 1.

Final Thoughts: Maniac is a fantastic film, some may agree, some may disagree, and others just don't care, and that's okay. Fans of horror in general, may like Maniac, others may too.

After watching some of todays horror films, this movie just lacks in comparison.  I'm sorry but this dvd just could not hold my attention.  I really wanted to send it back after the first few minutes. I have seen worse, so I can't say it's one of the worst movies ever made, but it just reeks of 80's cult classics (Now don't get me wrong, there are lots of cult classics that I like and own) Maniac just isn't one of them. This film has enough cheese to make anyone lactose intolerant, not to mention all the blood shots look like bright red halloween paint. It reminds me of the kind of movies they use to show at all night horror features, where you could pay one dollar to get in. In all fairness, I can see this being a nostalgic hit with some people, but if you're seeing it for the first time through fresh eyes it just comes off as boring.

799610,3,6304147074,"Then I'm afraid you have no choice but to purchase this bloody mess of a film! This is definitely not the kind of picture that I typically enjoy, but there is a rather important part of underground cinema history connected with it, all of which is well explained in the copious extras offered on this 30th Anniversary DVD set. The story may be quite sick and not well fleshed out, but it's one of those oddities that one has to look at on occasion. I am no fan of slasher movies, but this one IS different--the strange score by Jay Chattaway, the creepy ""underground"" camera angles, the moving and deeply troubling acting of Spinnell--and it makes an impression even on timid viewers by utilizing buckets of blood and scenes of grotesque suspense. But, in any case, there is a more important reason for owning this particular edition of the much damned ""Maniac"", and the reason is the second disc. If you are a film history buff, an enthusiast, or even one who thinks that movies and TV still contain far too many scenes of violence and sadism, then this extra disc is loaded with must-see critical footage that you will certainly enjoy. Apparently, critic Gene Siskel was so sickened by the brutality that he walked out of the theater in an angry state. The trouble is that it is very difficult to defend ""Maniac"" as art, and there certainly are few redeeming moments in terms of characterizations. Yet this second disc puts everything into perspective--interviews with directors like Joe Dante and critics such as Charles Champlin make it a film buff's haven of rare interviews and insights. It's too bad that other rare movies don't come with these kinds of extras because ""Maniac""--while rare nowadays and not a movie to put in if you have polite company over--is no exception when it comes to redefining the underground efforts of independent filmmakers. ""Maniac"" does have gore, but if you judge this one by its cover you might mislead yourself (oh there is violence, but not at the kind of level where you have to keep reaching for the trash can...)",1355097600,3,2056,4.729805013927576
799611,1,6304147074,"I ordered New York Ripper, Prowler and Maniac at the same time and received them on the same day and watched them pretty much one after the other.
And I got to say Maniac is easily the more unwatchable out of the three.
By the looks of the reviews I'm in the minority and that folks is a more frightening fact then anything you will find in Maniac.
I mean it is supposed to be the most graphical and realistic depictions of violence ever put on film, and yet WHERE in this movie is there any of that?
The basic premise itself for this type of movie is unforgivable.
In the NY Ripper and Prowler you know there's a nutbag on the loose killing off people(women) and no matter how bad the movie is you still get that scooby-doo type ending where the killer (typically predictable) is revealed.
In this P.O.S. you know right off the bat who the nutcase is and therefore there goes any attempt at having fun guessing who it may be and then kicking yourself for not getting it right at the end or treating yourself to a scooby treat if you got it right.
Basically you will get to see women being stabbed once through the chest and that's about it.
At the beginning a woman is strangled (wow haven't seen that on film before) and then scalped.
Near the end you will see someone's head get ripped off his shoulders and it's been done way better by the same guy (Savini) in Dawn and Day of the Dead.

Tom Savini's gruesome special-effects don't hurt either, adding an unflinching realism that modern ""horror"" films can only dream of. Prepare yourself for the notorious ""disco-boy"" scene that had Gene Siskel running from the theater, in which we get to see the damage caused to a man's head being blown apart at point blank range by 12-gauge buckshot.

People who have raved and repeatedly insisted I must see this movie...well...I finally did and I didn't care for it.  I understand that the main character, Frank Zito, is derranged.  He stalks women, kills them, carries on conversations with himself and more (I won't go into what else he does because I don't want to ruin it for anyone who may want to see the movie).  I get that people who do this are scary people.  However, I didn't find the movie scary or even interesting as a character study.  I apologized to my friend who dearly loves this movie numerous times because I didn't care much for it.

I know it is an 80s slasher which isn't my favorite genre.  The pacing seems slow between kills and the scenes in Frank's apartment seem to lag on at times (I know those scenes are to show how troubled he is but still...it got a wee bit old after a bit).  There is one kill that has quite a bit of blood splatter but nothing to write home about considering what some of the movies of today's time show.  The other kills were nothing notable.  It never really told why/how he picked his victims.  He was just hanging out across from a hospital then looked over and saw a woman standing there...There didn't seem to be any sort of preference or pattern aside from most of the victims were women.  Even though he killed women he still maintained a stable relationship for half of the movie.  It didn't really explain what was so special about her.

So aside from the somewhat slow pacing and lack of explaining motives/choices, I found the very end to be lame.  If it had ended anther way I might have found the movie a more interesting.  It just seemed that they tried to make a serious movie; yet, the end was laughable.",1327104000,2,1828,4.376854599406528

Now for the transfer: i have seen this film many, many times - on laserdisc, on DVD and even the one time in the last 30 years it has been screened in Germany (it was still banned for violence in 2007). And this blu-ray-transfer is the BEST transfer of the film I have seen up to now.

The picture quality is VERY good - for a low-budget-film, that was shot on 16mm, blown up to 35mm in 1980!

Please, keep that in mind when you complain about the transfer - this is not Avatar or Transformers 3. This is an independent movie shot on not-too-expensive material.

Concerning this, Blue Underground did a tremendous job with this blu-ray.

799714,3,6304147074,"""Maniac"" kind of gets lost in the shuffle of 80's horror films and that's a shame because ""Maniac"" offers a bit more than the typical 80's horror film. Instead of a bunch of teens out to have sex and smoke pot getting picked  off one-by-one, ""Maniac"" actually tries to provide more story behind the bloodshed. Joe Spinell plays the character of Frank Zito, a tortured loner that stalks the streets of late 1970's New York City. Zito is haunted by the memory of his abusive mother who he still tries to connect with through several mannequins kept in his apartment. Zito dresses the mannequins up in the clothing of the women he's murdered and scalped, using his victim's hair as the finishing touch.

Where ""Maniac"" stands apart from the rest of the 80's slashers is in Spinell's performance at Zito. While ""Maniac"" is a horror film to the core, Spinell gives us more than just a faceless killer with Frank Zito. We get to see what drives Zito's rage and why he kills. Granted, no one is going to mistake ""Maniac"" for a weighty drama on psychopathic behavior, but at least it provides more than the usual splatter fare.

Now, the real draw for me and the reason to purchase this blu-ray are the special effects provided by Tom Savini. The F/X horror icon is at the top of his game with ""Maniac"", and in this day of CGI special effects, Savini's effects seem all the more realistic and grim. There are some genuine shocking moments in this film, punctuated by some of the most intense gore effects ever seen.

Frank Zito may not have the recognition of a Jason Vorhees or Michael Myers, but he does make quite an impact in his only film.",1316563200,,1636,4.535593220338983
799800,4,6304147074,"In the streets of New York, there lives a troubled man named Frank Zito (Joe Spinell) who is fat, sweaty and sleazy as he had a troubled childhood and now that his mom died he decides to take out his rage at night. He stalks and butchers innocent people then afterwards he would scalp them as he collects them. A lovely photographer (Caroline Munroe) comes into his life as he falls for her yet has to keep his dark secret shut.

A harrowing, gruesome, depressing and well made horror drama slasher flick from William Lustig who would make Blue Underground for DVD and Blu-Ray including Elite productions for laserdisc. This film created quite a stir in November of 1980 when it came out as it was protested by some as ""sexest gory filth"" even by critics like Gene Siskel who actually walked out during a screening while it made good money at the box-office and drive-ins, it was released unrated with a ""No one under 17 will be admitted"" warning. Tom Savini's gore and make-up effects are shockingly realistic including the infamous scene where he plays a disco jockey who gets his head blown off with a shotgun in the car and the acting isn't half bad but Spinell from ""The Godfather"" did a good performance as the title killer. This film is about going into the madness of a killer and through his eyes of what makes a man a monster. This unpleasant film is not for everyone or weak stomaches but worth a view for horror film fans, slasher fans, gorehounds or grindhouse cinema as you can see it even influence today's shockers like The Devil's Rejects to the Saw/Hostel franchises.

A brilliant and crisp Blu-Ray transfer on the picture that feels fresh despite a couple of instances of grain as the sound is even terrific. The extras are great such as interviews, audio commentaries, interviews, trailers, TV Spots, Radio Spots, Mr. Robbie: Maniac 2 promo reel, Joe Spinell documentary and still galleries.

799803,5,6304147074,"This movie is a great grindhouse slasher, although it's not really a slasher. It's from the ""Maniac's"" point of view, and you get
to see his ""at home"" insane sessions. He has mannequins all over his apartment, with scalp ""wigs"" he took from various victims. The actor, Joe Spinell, did an amazing acting performance as the disturbed creep who suffers from memories of horrific abuse from his mom.
His sweaty skin, his big bulging eyes, his huge hulk of a menacing figure, his creepy facial expressions....all combine to make this ""Maniac"" one of the scariest villiams of all the 80's slashers. And this guy is realistic, unlike Jason, Freddy, and to an extent Michael Myers, who seems to never die movie after movie (lol).  I think the scariest scene was when the nurse was being stalked by him. That whole ""chase"" sequence was very suspenseful and tense, and I was getting pretty freaked out. I would say the most violent part is a tie between Tom Savini's death and what happens to the maniac at the end. The scene with Savini was outright shocking....and excellent to cure a gore hound's craving! The picture was pretty good, but the ""graininess"" of it adds to the grindhouse classic charm. The sound is good as well. Hearing Frank Zito's one sided conversations is something to definately get under one's skin.
In conclusion, if you want to see a great grindhouse slasher that's more of a character study that ""stalk 'n' slash"" , with excellent
gore effecs rather than cheesy CGI, I recommend ""Maniac"" with 5 stars!",1301184000,,1519,4.775665399239544
799804,4,6304147074,"For any hardcore horror fan, Maniac is an Essential. Maniac is in a horrorhead's Top 50 Must-Sees. For other viewers, they might or might not appreciate William Lustig and Joe Spinell's masterpiece. Note, I did not write ""enjoy""; I wrote appreciate. This slasher classic succeeds in creeping-out and horrifying its audience, even its target audience (and, we are kinda creepy outselves). Maniac has a primal simplicity to its plot, violence, and dialogue. And, it is unsparingly realistic in its gore and presentation of madness. It is a disturbing film that one will unlikely re-watch soon after viewing it. Film star Caroline Munro reports that she can rarely re-watch Maniac.

I mention that Maniac is an essential for hardcore horror viewing. My statement's central reason is that Maniac is a masterpiece within the slasher and extreme horror sub-genres. Effects creator Tom Savini is at the top of his game in Maniac. Star Joe Spinell gives the performance of his career. He is so convincing as Frank Zito (the killer) that I am shocked when he acts normal at a certain point. Director and horror-king William Lustig is at the top of his game. This 1980 effort bloodily overflows with memorable images, and it walks a--well--razor line between gritty and shocking and too-much. Also, despite its infamy, Maniac is neither shock for shock's sake nor misogyny for misogny's sake. The film has underlying points and overt art. Not all video-nasties can claim that.

DVD EXTRAS:  The extras are a great tribute to Spinnell and the movie. The audience learns everything needed to know how the movie came about, who Joe was, and how Maniac was received. These extras are perhaps as good as one could hope for. Definitely, watch the extras. They hold a person's interest the entire time.",1300838400,,1785,5.0033670033670035

799806,5,6304147074,"Maniac is without a doubt one of those very rare (yet raw) pieces of cinema that probably did not expect to have such a powerful impact on the horror genre, much less greatly change, or even create, a new type of horror film. However, in 1980, an unholy trio - William Lustig, Tom Savini and Joe Spinell, did that very thing. With deaths sequences incorporating amazing new special effects by Tom Savini that, even to this day, are so realistic and shockingly human that it still makes me gasp (it also raised the bar when it came to gore on-screen, leaving behind some of the most memorable gory moments in film history). This ultraviolent free-for-all is not given to you softly either. Instead you are reluctantly forced to stare into this creepy and insidious city with the artful direction of William Lustig. So vivid is his vision that he sucessfully reminds us that the city is just as ugly as it is beautiful. But I think that it's most magnetic and unsettling-hypnotic main character, beautifuly played by a most talented late Joe Spinell, in a performance that is clearly torture for him while also torturing to the viewer, that really sets this film apart from your avarage indie 80's slasher fare. The sondtrack further hightens your anxiety and hits on notes that feel as if the nerves in your brain aren't quite firing all that right either.
  Maniac feels as if it set out to make a brutal slasher film but when it came back it was something much, much more. Something that had yet to be tapped and in the final result it is successful and very frightening. I feel Maniac is an important film, and not in just the horror genre either, but in American cinema in general. Many films to come, like Silence of the Lambs, Basic Instinct and Seven, have Maniac to thank for combining psychological horror and shockingly violent imagery in a way that no one had ever attempted. It's not that ""they just don't make 'em like this anymore"", but rather they CAN'T make 'em like this anymore.",1294876800,12,1995,4.632768361581921

I never expected A Super HQ Transfer like Wizard of Oz or Iron Man to name a few,
I think for a Super Low Budget B-Movie Filmed in 16mm  it looks better then the DVD
Plus the  7.1 DTS Audio is Killer and sound very Good.
IMO Blue Underground did there best with a Transfer they should be commended for the great job on the Audio

There are people out there mentally ill from various forms of abuse!
That makes this much more Scary!
The main character is Human.  Not some super-human killing machine
It could easily be called a sequel to Psycho set in NY

If you haven't seen this yet, but love gore, you owe it to yourself to see this one. It's not like your typical slasher flick. Instead of the story being about the victims, its more about the killer himself and the torture he goes through in his mind. Classic stuff for sure! Despite this being a great film, the transfer to blu-ray is hideous. Film grain all over the place. It's not much better than my THX DVD copy. I was very disappointed. They should let some company, like ""Criterion"", for example, remaster this for the blu-ray transfer. If you recall, the current blu-ray version of the original Godzilla is awful too.

The picture is full of murky blacks, persistent grain, milky picture and very little appearance of anything ""high definition"".  At best, the soundtracks has a lot of punch and is spotless and aggressive.  Blue Underground perhaps should have considered the appropriate quality of the source before making a high definition transfer, which seems rather a pointless endeavor.

He's a sweaty fat sicko who lurks around 1980's NYC randomly killing and scalping innocent women because he suffered horrible child abuse from his deceased mother. He eventually meets a woman he likes (Caroline Munro) and tries to have a normal relationship but the demons won't go away.

It's been quite a while now and I am fixing to give it another shot. I wasn't too fond of the film at the time. But now having looked up the trailer for it on youtube, I rented it from Netflix. To those of you who like this film, you might check out another film called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eyes-of-a-Stranger/dp/B000TUDBFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eyes of a Stranger</a>. Which is one of my personal favorites. It's similar in style to this. It too was also made in 1980. Despite Amazon's 1981 tag by its title, I checked the ending credits and it states 1980. Also another film that is more highly similar to this one of which I own on VHS called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forced-Entry/dp/B0009OE1V6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forced Entry</a>&nbsp;. I only watched it once and after rewinding the tape, it was so old the ribbon at the beginning of the tape snapped, lol. I'm possibly gonna wait for it to come out on dvd.

Hopefully after I watch it and if its good enough, I'll buy it here on Amazon. The only reason Im giving it one star is because, my memory's a blur other than what I stated I remembered earlier. Hopefully I'll give it a better rating once I watch it again.

UPDATE:

Well I watched the film again for the 1st time in a long time. It has grown on me somewhat. I was going to give it a 3 star rating from first glance. But after a 2nd viewing, I started to realize how creepy those Mannequins are. The ending scene in the apartment is what really creeps me out. Very contorted and morbid. I'd probably watch this more on a cold dark overcast dreary day. While some parts are not at times well put together as far as acting goes, it still made its mark in the cult film genre. If it wasn't for the infamous Graphic 12 Gauge Shot-gun murder scene (Thanks to good ol' Tom Savini) and for the ending it would not have gotten a 4th star from me.

This is not your typical slasher as it is told from the first person, in this case it is mamma's boy played by Joe spinnel.  He's whiney and obsessivley crazy, probably the most annoying antangoinst ever.

Granted there is the infamous 'point blank shotgun' scene but other than that, there is no entertainment value to this film unless you're a misgonistic lunatic.

In fact he has a cameo that leads into one of the best effects shots of his that I'd ever seen. Easily the high point at what could have been an above average slasher movie.

The movie is better filmed and acted than the bulk of '80's slasher flicks. But it really isn't good. The problem is that the solitary slasher is the main character.

The first half of the movie follows the killer through a string of unrelated murders with no time spent building the character of the only actor on screen for more than ten minutes, the killer.

I was surprised that as an extra on the DVD, they included a collection of bad reviews the movie had garnered on its release. At the time the movie was pretty controversial and I can see why. Some of the negative reviews in the extras called the movie pornography and I think they had a point. It feels sort of like a porn movie, with graphic murder replacing graphic sex. There's some stereotypical setup (a nurse walking to the subway, a couple making out while parked in an empty lot) that leads to a murder. Rinse. Repeat.

Maniac!'s lack of a real storyline is sorely missed. In the second half, they do put a story together, but it should have been carried through the entire film rather than just the second half. As a result, Maniac! was 'interesting', but not 'good'.",1262995200,2,1683,5.003571428571429
800090,3,6304147074,"This gory serial killer film got some press on original release for Tom Savini's fairly gruesome shotgun-to-the-head scene which occurs fairly early in the film, and Gene Siskel famously claimed to have walked out at that point, saying that the film could never redeem itself.  I'm rather divided as to whether he was right or not.  On the one hand, the portrait of late 70s New York with the seedy rubbing shoulders with the wealthy and stylish is nicely done - mostly coming from the seedy and resentful point of view, there is the gorgeous Caroline Munro to look at, and Joe Spinell's Frank Zito, while not exactly the most original psycho killer ever seen (he hears voices, imagines that the mannequins he dresses with women's scalps are real women, has a mommy fixation, etc) at least seems very real - he's sweaty, fat, unattractive and ill-dressed, and does a decent job at alternating between thoroughly crazy and just slightly weird. On the other hand it beggars belief even in a low-budget horror film that Munro's supermodel photographer character would just start going out with this guy after he finds his way to her apartment (from the info he's found rooting through her belongings) with merely the excuse that he saw her take his picture in the park.

The music, photography, and acting are all certainly no worse than average for a sleazy cheapie like this, but they aren't good enough to really be noticeable either.  Lustig's direction is competent for the most part, with one standout scene as our friendly neighborhood psycho slowly stalks a comely nurse victim through a deserted subway station - an excellent builing of suspense here that is sadly not replicated in the rest of the film.  Savini's effects still look decent enough and the violent scenes are in general well-handled, but the film really goes downhill in the last few scenes, with a graveyard scene that wouldn't look out of place in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE leading into one of the weakest endings I've ever seen in a horror film. Oh well. For genre completists and hard-core aficionados, I would think.",1258243200,3,2091,4.829608938547486
800091,3,6304147074,"I read some reviews on this film which claimed it was one of the best in it's genre, and decided I would purchase it and hopefully have the enjoyment of owning it to view when I please. The cover of the movie alone was one of the most intriguing things about this film and made me ever so curious as to the nature of the film. It was a descent movie but not quite as good as what I had read. Although I am more of an avid zombie/monster flick fan and thus, this insight comes from someone who likes older horror movie based on gore and cheesy effects that are awesome, I do however come to appreciate at times psychological thriller type movies and even if a movie isn't super gory yet is done well I can appreciate that.

On the gore level, the movie almost seems to boast more than it actually delivers.
- a few choke scenes
- a short scalping scene
- one short stab scene
- a shooting scene (which is actually pretty cool)
- and the last crazy scene (the best one)

I guess the movie kind of made you think about why it is the character was doing the things he does, there wasn't much narrative that really explained it. He was a fat, ugly, sweaty guy so I guess maybe he just hated life cause he was so ugly, haha but not really, he's just your average disturbed serial murderer who likes to take stuff from those he kills and put them on manikins that he props up in his bed and talks to. I didn't really get it and I wasn't really creeped out by this mental but silly looking fat dude whispering to the manikins dressed like his victims. Not as intriguing as you might think I suppose if that sounds remotely cool.

Anyways the movie is around 80 minutes, kind of short, and though semi original with the ideas just didn't have quite as much of an awe that I got from one that is just a tad better being New York Ripper, which had it's own little bit of originality and had a bit more interesting death scenes although slow in some parts. I'm sorry but one of the most entertaining works of the slasher/murderer film genre to ME is some films of the Friday the 13th series. Anyways, I won't go on anymore about this film. I would recommend borrowing it from someone you know who has it or watching scenes on youtube to get what I'm talking about a bit more haha.",1252800000,3,2268,4.197247706422019

800093,5,6304147074,"I actually saw this film in a theater when it came out in 1980.
The local ""word of mouth"" spread like wild-fire.
Only one theater was showing it, one showing, at night!
You had to be at least 18 to get in, and in those days, they werent
kidding.
All I knew about it at the time was, nothing like it had ever been done
before, it was over the top violent and graphic.

Well, that was an understatment!
When the ""maniac"" title character jumped on the hood of the car and
aimed a shotgun at the driver (played by Tom Savini), I fully expected
the camera to cut! It didnt!!! Not only did the camera not cut away, we
see all the action in slow motion!! Even then, after the shotgun blast,
the camera dwells on the carnage for several seconds as we see blood and flesh drip from the car's front seat.

I knew I was in for a ride.

I think this film is shocking enough today on DVD, but back in 1980, it
was totally unpresidented. It had gotten such a negative reputation, I
had to be careful who I told I had seen it, and worse, loved it!

I was sure this one was destined for the garbage incinerator!!

Ya know, as a film buff, and having studied film in college, I can sit
and debate Antonioni, or Bresson, or whoever with the best film snob,
but this movie is one of my personal favorites.

For it's own, it works for me as cineama. It shocks and disturbs like
nothing I have seen. It possitivly suspends the viewer in utter dispare,
loathing, and fear.
By the end, I feel drained and dirty.

There is no actual story here, just a few days spent inside the head of
a very sick person. It's all from his point of view.

Unlike some of it's contemporaries like Friday the 13th, there is absolutly no snickering and giggling when a abnoxious horny teenage is
dispatched. The killings here have a gritty, dirty reality that is very
disturbing. The entire film is humorless and unrelenting to the graphic
end.

This is one of those movies, like In a Glass Cage or Salo, or Cannibal
that pushes the envelope, and puts you in a world where even your darkest
dreams never go.",1240790400,3,2064,4.258312020460358

I found this a bit dissapointing at first as the killer isn't exactly likeable and we just seem to see scenes of him killing women (mostly women) and nothing else. But part way through, he befriends a women who becoms another protagonist and I found the movie more interesting from here.

There is quite a decent body-count in Maniac and the deaths that there are are quite bloody and a couple were very suspecful (especially the girl in the subway). The excellent gore effects were done by Tom Savini who also did the gore effects for the origional Dawn of the Dead and another slasher movie called Rosemary's Killer (AKA The Prowler).

The DVD claims to be ""uncut"" but is infact cut by 54 seconds, so I would reccommend buying the American Region 1 DVD if you want the movie fully uncut. As far as I know, the majority of this cut is made up in the infamous ""scalping scene"" near the start of the movie.

unlike murder set pieces and it's ridiculous, exaggerated, frequently palumbo-created hype, this movie actually was the subject of much controversy upon it's release in 1980. it was banned from many theaters across the states and across the majority of europe and australia for it's graphic violence and a perceived violent objectification of women.

joe spinell (the godfather) does a fantastic job as the mentally and sexually disturbed frank zito. i truly think this movie would have failed without him.

with that being said, i must state that, basically, this is a joyless and very difficult watch. after my first viewing, i remember just kinda staring at the dvd menu for awhile unable to really comprehend what i had just watched. there was no felling of elation. i wasn't pumped and excited after another kick butt horror flick. i felt dirty and was actually kind of depressed.

i only just recently watched maniac again and, immediately following it's completion, wondered why i had subjected myself to it for a second time. with that being said... you're not a true horror fan without having this in your collection... if for no other reason than for the scene with tom savini.",1234224000,2,1456,4.812

There is never much insight into explaining the motives behind the carnage,other then the fact that the psychopath has cigarette burns all over his body and you get the idea that it was done when he was at a young age as he calls out mommy and burns his mannequins.

The effects by Tom Savini are really good but what really make the film shine in my opinion is Joe Spinell. His performance as the manic Frank Zito is simply great. You really believe this character is messed up in the head. Basic plot is a man with issues (don't wanna spoil exactly what they are for those that haven't seen it yet) goes around killing & scalping woman. Going back to Tom Savini's effects like I said before, 2 particular scenes I felt were great involved a gun shot through a windshield & the scene at the very end. Those were just some great looking effects. This 2 disc set has plenty of extras any fan of the film or of Joe Spinell will enjoy including commentaries, interviews, trailers, gallery. My 3 personal favorite features are 1) a look at the controversy the film caused when first released that includes articles & old news coverage of it. 2) The Joe Spinell story. Interviews with people who knew him, has stories about his work & life. 3) Mr. Robbie Maniac 2 promo reel.

800226,4,6304147074,"Despite being a cult classic Maniac is a movie that is far too overlooked in the horror genre as nothing more than a sleazy exploitation flick with no merits at all except the gore, which was done by Tom Savini. But I have to heavily disagree; Maniac has a lot more going for it than one might think. Upon its release in 1980 Maniac was attacked for its graphic violence, which most of the victims were women. Many deemed this nothing more than vile trash and looked upon as nothing more than 1 step above porn (but barley at that). Maniac was heavily censored and even banned in many places as well.

The funny thing is at the time of the release there were other movies just as shocking if not more so than Maniac, but yet this is the one that people attacked and probably helped gain the movie more attention over the years. As I stated before there is a lot more going for Maniac than simply gore and sleaze.

The screenplay by C.A. Rosenberg & Joe Spinell was fairly solid nothing here really stands out, but overall it's well written for the genre that it is in. Frank Zito played by Joe Spinell is the typical serial killer with mother problems. If you look at most serial killers many of them had some kind of psychical and or mental abuse from their mothers at a young age. Rosenberg and Spinell never really stray from that and offer anything different, but what they have works well and is an interesting character study of a man trying to at times fight his urges.

Maniac marked the feature film debut for William Lustig (unless you wanna count the porn flicks he made prior under the name Billy Bagg). Lustig is an often overlooked filmmaker who did some solid work, but never really got the attention he deserved. He got his start at the time when filmmakers like John Carpenter, Dario Argento and George Romero were at the peak of their career. Lustig though has built up a following, but he never really reached the success like other filmmakers from his era.

William Lustig is a big fan of 70s exploitation and it clearly shows with Maniac; Lustig manages to create a really gritty and uneasy feel through out the picture and always keeps the pace moving along even when there is no action. The murder scenes are quite graphic and bloody, but while the gore is great the highlight is the murders are very mean spirited. Starting around the mid 80s and you can even make a case for the early 80s as well, too many movies would have kill scenes that were sort of fun, which is cool, but I prefer movies like this where the deaths give you an uneasy feel.

Like I said Maniac has a lot more going for it than people might realize. The shotgun blast to the head easily rates as one of the greatest murders this genre has ever seen. I'd even go as far to say possibly the best death scene in the genre, but there is far more here than just shocking murder scenes. The scene in which, Frank stalks a young nurse (Kelly Piper) leaving the hospital all the way to the subway and than in the subway is a classic example of suspense and tension; the whole set up is excellent and downright chilling.

And the scene when Frank attacks Rita played by Abigail Clayton (under the name Gail Lawrence) was another prime example of a scene filled with suspense and tension. William Lustig again is able to make more than just sleazy exploitation flick and delivers a movie that is quite disturbing and even chilling in many areas. William Lustig in his day was an excellent filmmaker who never really hit the big time despite being very deserving of it.

The acting was mostly good and Joe Spinell probably best known as Gazzo from Rocky and Rocky II gives the best performance of his career. Frank Zito is a classic character and far scarier than most horror movie villains since people like Frank are out there. He isn't the boogeyman who can survive multiple gunshots, stabbings and being set on fire. He's as human as his victims and Spinell is downright chilling in the role, which is a lot more complex than some might realize.

Maniac is a nice piece of 80s exploitation cinema with plenty of sleaze and violence, but again has a lot more to offer than just that. The only problem with Maniac is the final act, while isn't bad or anything, but does fall a bit flat. But besides that Maniac was excellent and a must see for horror fans.",1226102400,2,4344,4.448492462311558

The music by Jay Chattaway gives an uneasy feeling to an already ""know to be"" uneasy film. Tom Savini does the ever wonderful special effects further proving that he is an effects god.
 William Lustig has created a masterpiece of cinematic filth and mayhem.

As for the movie, I have to say Joe Spinell did a fantastic job as the serial killer. His pockmarked face and crazy eyes really gave his character that extra creepiness which made the movie a good watch. It's amusing to see how Spinell's character can smoothly transition from a psycho-killer to an effeminate hairdresser who gives advice on how to wash blood out of hair. And he gives this advice to one of the few mannequins he has in his tiny apartment.

Added bonus is Tom Savini's appearance as some regular joe who picks up a girl at a club. However, that's not the interesting part: his exit is interesting or shall I say spectacular! I didn't expect it and nicely executed, too.

See this movie if you like to chuckle at serial killers who have weird mannerisms. In other words, if you have an eye for detail and like to focus on those small things which most people overlook. It will help you enjoy this film that much more.

As a warning, this film will only appeal to a certain type of horror fan or viewer. It's not for everyone but I think it's worth viewing even one time.",1222905600,,1243,4.344827586206897

The film has a really seedy vibe to it due to being shot in NYC in 1980, years before it was ""cleaned up"" by Giuliani.  There's an air of desperation in the film, a whispering brutality.  However, while it has great special effects that still hold up today, it's still not as artistic or as great as it could have been.  Joe Spinnell (who stars and co-produced) stars as the deeply disturbed title character, a man who was abused as a child and now is reeking havoc on NYC streets and collecting his victims back in his apartment.  There's some great atmosphere, and a great chase in a subway bathroom, but overall the film just feels incomplete.  It teeters on the edge, but doesn't become an underrated, misunderstood masterpiece.  The film should be viewed more as an 80's time capsule than a great piece of cinema.

There is no evidence to support it throughout the entire film.  If there was more exposition it might have come out better but all we get is a poorly acted nutcase going around killing people with a quick ""this is why"" at the end.

The acting is mediocre, the story is lacking, the writing sucks.  The worst part is watching with the director's commentary.  He seems to think he was creating a gift to the genre and the entire film industry.  He is dead wrong.  Usually when I find a DVD in the $5 bin I can forgive it no matter how bad it is.

His victims are women, and he dispatches them in the grisliest of fashion with no end of his deeds in sight.  Directed with a suspenseful flair by William Lustig, Maniac is a landmark of the horror/slasher genre thanks to the brilliant gore effects of the legendary Tom Savini, who also appears in the film as the unlucky ""disco boy"", and has a demise that is one of the most memorable you'll see in the film.  Spinell himself is suitably creeply (and even more suitably believable) in Maniac, which sadly starts to lose steam when Zito meets a woman (Caroline Munro) whom he hits it off with.  It should also be noted that Maniac can be a hard film to watch, even for die hard gorehounds, because of the film's misogynistic approach.  This is original, grindhouse cinema all the way, and Maniac makes no apologies or pulls no punches about it either.

800323,5,6304147074,"Maniac is everything a horror film should be, dark, disturbing, realistic, of course extremely violent, and most importantly original. This is possibly one of my favourite horror flick's of all time, and to me the epitome of a perfect horror(slasher) movie in every sense of the word. Instead of focusing on a corny group of teenager's like most slasher's, it focuses more on the mind of the killer, his mental health issue's, and his distaste for 'pretty women'. This is a horror film done right with a great plot, great direction, great performances, and awesome special effect's. This is one of the closest portayal's of a real life 'maniac' I've ever seen put to film. Exactly what I want when buying a film like this. I want to be shocked, I want to be disgusted, and I want to be repulsed. That is what horror is supposed to do (see definition of horror), and that's what Maniac does.

Joe Spinnels' performance is absolutely disturbing, hilarious, and completely realistic all at the same time. His character is loosely based on Ed Gein, and he has these two personalities that are constantly arguing with each other. It's actually very disturbing to watch, but completey plausible at the same time. He does a fantastic job at playing this schizophrenic role and carries the movie with his great performance.

Tom Savinis' effect's are amazing as alway's. This is probably some of his best work in my opinion. There is so much detail put into every effect. He make's sure that they are alway's using the right angle's, the right motion's, amount of blood, the right timing, it's actually really brilliant in it's own right. From his time as a war photographer he know's what this stuff is supposed to look like......it's not pretty, and it show's with Maniac.

This is arguably Will Lustig's best film with good reason, Maniac is an extremely original horror film that I really can't compare to any other slasher I have seen. There is simply nothing like it. Brutally realistic and completey unforgiving. When I buy a movie like this, I want extreme violence and a lot's of it, and Maniac deliver's 100%.

As other reviewers have said though, what sets this apart is the performance of Spinell and the whole narrative structure. This is not merely another slasher flick - it's a study of an individual whose evil nature takes control of his, seeminly at times against his will.

Hearing this maniac breathing and grunting as he's watching his potential victims was probably more disturbing than the violence - and their's plenty of it here for the gorehounds (thank you Mr Savini!) and the shotgun scene is, well, a blast!

800326,5,6304147074,"Believe it or not but I found this film to be one of the greatest horror films ever made , definitely one of the best slasher films. In this film there definitely was a motive to the killings. I didn't really just see this as only a slasher film but as an insight into the life of a killer. Really like Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer. Both films were really just observations of the human condition or the soul. Observations on what drives these men into their own mad worlds. I also thought that both treated the killer as a real character. A real person with serious problems. Even though the killer was this terrible bad guy, I felt bad for him because inside of him he was only a child. A child who was hurt and abused by his mother. Again like HENRY. I'd say that this film is as much of a horror film as it is a drama. I also have to say that Jay Chattaway's score for this film was brilliant, probably one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard. 10/10",1186272000,,977,4.174603174603175

IT wasn't winter time, but spring or summer, yet I was shaking very much. Even though I'm now 44 years old, I don't think I would care to see it again. It was the first slasher movie for me at that time, and seeing women getting scalped especilly bothered me. I rate it a 5 for scaring me like it did, and for how real it looked to me back then. If I were to watch it again now, it would be just to see how I could take it now, but I wouldn't let my two children watch it that's for sure, and I wouldn't want my wife to watch it either.",1184457600,2,912,3.7801047120418847

800437,4,6304147074,"First, let me say I love horror movies from the 80's. Next, let me say that this movie is not your typical 80s horror movies. There is indeed your typical gore and the complimentary nude woman that comes with most 80s films. But the difference comes in the realism of Maniac.

Frank is a schizophrenic psychopathic murderer. And unlike most horror movies where we follow the exploits of a group of kids as they slowly get stalked and killed by such a killer, in Maniac we see things from the point of view of the killer. This makes the murders even more frightening, because we see in depth the struggle that this murderer is going through in his own twisted mind and spend a lot of time in his terrifyingly decorated apartment.

Joe Spinell's acting raises the terror level another notch, simply because he's so believably insane. Watching him sob around his apartment and dress his mannequins in fresh scalps is very very frightening.

The only drawback to the film is that by focussing so much on Frank, the killing scenes start to feel a bit repetitive, with a new woman being introduced to the film, followed for a few minutes, and then gruesomely murdered. The ending is a bit weak also, although it leaves room for a sequel. Unfortunately, I looked on IMDB and they started to make a sequel, but Joe Spinell died, which prevented them from finishing the film. Speaking of Spinell, the DVD features a 51 minute featurette that talks in depth about Joe Spinell and his acting career, as well as his life.

If you like horror films of any kind, this is a film for you. If you're interested in real-life serial killers, definitely check this film out. It feels so realistic at times, that you almost feel like Dahmer or Bundy is being shown in his private home. Maniac is that rare gem: a truly quality horror movie.",1175990400,2,1819,4.587692307692308

800439,4,6304147074,"""Maniac"" is one of those movies that make me want to take a bath after I watch it because I feel gritty.

That in itself tells me it was a highly effective realistically sick movie and did what it set out to do.

Joe Spinell is so good in this role that I sometimes wondered if he wrestled with the same demons his character ""Frank"" did. He was so tragic in his psychotic confusion you almost felt pity for him. This film made me scared to go into a public ladies room for weeks after I saw it, much like Jaws and the water and Psycho and the shower.

 Of course Tom Savini is the master of gore in my opinion and he doesn't disappoint in this film, is it gratuitous?  Sure it is, isn't that why we watch a slasher or horror film to be shocked or scared,  Of course it is.
Maniac is so scary and effective because it could really happen, There are really Freaks like Frank  out there.""SHUDDER""",1165881600,8,893,4.156976744186046
800440,5,6304147074,"I had been curious to see the movie Maniac for years.  Being a huge horror fan since I was a child I was surprised that I hadn't seen it somewhere along the line before.  However I have never been able to find it any video stores even after the dvd release.  I ended up getting it on Netflix and let me just say....it would have been fully worth the cost of purchasing it blindly!

This is truly an underrated slasher/horror film and, in my opinion, one of the absolute best slasher flicks of the 80's, but not in the way one might think and certainly not in the way I expected.  I expected a run-of-the-mill cheesy, T&A, horror flick, which would have been absolutely fine with me, but instead I got a very gnarly, incredibly acted (Joe Spinell was amazing), horrific and suspenseful, even sad horror story.  I have rarely been so surprised in a good way at any film.

I will try not to give anything away, but be warned I probably will give away some of the surprises, at least they were in my opinion.

One thing that I loved so much was how well we get to know the killer.  He is not a one-dimensional or shallow character, he is complex and tortured and....just another guy!  I have never seen a killer portrayed in quite this way.  For the first half of the film, maybe even more, we see him in his home and we see him stalk and kill people, and we see him being a maniac.  Then suddenly at the halfway point, maybe a little further our Maniac becomes interested in a woman who takes his picture in a park.  He goes to her home under a premise that is basically non-existant, which is really the only weak point in the plot might I add--exactly how he got his foot in the door with her, so to speak.  I can forgive it because maybe more happened that they just didn't show.  Anyway, the point is that this man who we have seen as little more than a tortured soul, a murderer, a lunatic, comes into this beautiful woman's home and is completely normal.  He is charming, whitty, jokes with her, he is intelligent, thoughtful, talks with her about art and her photography, they go on a date and she seems to genuinely like this big guy.  And I felt bewildered!  I already felt bad for the guy--I have hardly ever felt such sympathy for the ""bad guy"" like this but boy i did in this case and his interactions with this lady make it all the more sad, seeing that he can in fact be okay, at least for a time.

Anyhow, withour revealing much more than that which I was so excited about, this movie avoids a lot of typical horror cliches right up to the end which is nice.  I wish it had not ended so abruptly, but hey, I can't ask for much more with this one!

The effects are VERY well done.  This is Savini at his best--some of the work in here is even better than his work in the Dead movies, which to me, is saying a lot.

If you are a fan of 80s horror, or ANY slasher/horror you would do well to check this movie out.  It is dramatic, creepy, chilling (especially the Savini cameo scene--yikes!), and sad.  Has more layers in my opinion than most movies of its kind.  :)",1163376000,3,3075,4.222602739726027
800441,4,6304147074,"I guess there must be something profoundly wrong with me, because I rather liked ""Maniac"".  Sure, I'll concede that its definately not for everyone, but what is?  As the old cliche goes, one man's trash is another man's treasure.  So, what did I like about Maniac?

1) While marketed as a slasher film, it utilized none of the stock slasher film cliches that were so prevalent at the time.  Namely, the ""all the sluts die but the virgin gets away"" faux morality of Friday the 13th and Halloween.

2) The killer is not a super human killing machine like Jason or Freddy. Rather, this character is real.  Not in a literal sense, but its easy to believe that a killer like this could exist.  ""Maniac"" is as much a character study as it is a horror film.  Joe Spinnel gives an outstanding performance as ""Frank"", a schizophrenic serial killer.  He's a three dimensional character, and the film is told entirely by his point of view.  As you will see in the film, he's not pure evil.  He's clearly trying to stop, but he can't.  I actually felt pity for him.

3) I was impressed by the more than competant direction and cinematography.  The film is shot in a very realistic, almost documentary style.  The performances are natural and believable. The musical score was excellent as well.  This film is a textbook example of what can be achieved on a low budget with some imagination and skill.

4) I won't be a hypocrite.  I'll admit it.  I enjoyed this film on a visceral level.  While pretty tame by today's standards, the gore effects were expertly executed by the always brilliant Tom Savini.  If this makes me a ""sick person"", then I'm no more demented than the millions of fans who line up to see ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Scarface"", and hundreds of other ""visceral"" films.  And I'm no more sick than the millions of people who spend hours a day playing ""Grand Theft Auto"".  The point is that its a MOVIE.  No one ever got hurt by watching a movie, or playing a video game, for that matter.  If watching ""Maniac"" is all it takes to send you over the edge, you were probably pretty screwed up to begin with.  Isn't there enough real horrors in the world to get upset about???

So, to those who found the film so offensive that they would condemn everyone who doesn't share in their phony moral indignation, why did you bother to watch the film all the way to the end?  Weren't you sufficiently outraged halfway through the film?

And, without giving away too much of the ending, it was not ""stupid"" as some have charged.  Frank was clearly hallucinating.  Since the film was told by his point of view, the audience could ""see"" his hallucinations.  His wounds were purely self-inflicted.  Once again, the director choose to be original rather than to fall back on the old textbook cliches, which in this case would have been a final showdown in which Caroline Munro kills him.

Highly underratted, unfairly bashed and dismissed by critics, ""Maniac"" achieves what it aspires to be; a very original and very imaginative horror film with a great performance by Joe Spinnel.  For fans of ""good"" low budget horror films by the likes of George Romero and Wes Craven, this is essential viewing, which is why they play it fairly regularly on IFC.  I'll take this film over ""Final Destination 1, 2, and 3"", or similar formulatic crap masquerading as horror films any day of the week.",1159401600,5,3372,4.597315436241611
800442,1,6304147074,"This is a horrible movie with no redeeming value. I realize that such a knock will actually drive people to purchase this. Let me bring something to you attention.

This is a slasher movie with effective gore. In fact, for the time, the gore was more sick that similar movies. However, there are no scares, no suspense, no clever script, no story and it has a stupic ending. I know, that applies to most gore movies!

The problem with this movie is that it is overly mean spirited towards women (I am a man, a 6 foot 235 pound big strong guy that also raises a family).

The story, which has a guy killing women b/c of mistreatment from his mother, seems like it was written and directed by a person that shares the same demons as the killer of the film.

The murders in this movie are so mean-spirited (yet with no cinematic value) that a normal movie goer would have to be offended. This movie is not sick in a ""good"" movie way but rather sick in an ashamed manner.

This is a woman-bashing movie that should make any viewer feel guilty that they are patronizing this garbage. A movie should have an entertainment value. There is no cinematic, artistic touch on this film.

As I said before, by the end of the film, you really have feelings for the killer. Tom Savini has come through once again with some really cool special effects. He truly is the master of horror gore. But that's the thing about this movie, there wasn't really that much gore. None was needed to tell this really surprisingly terrific story.

800445,4,6304147074,"Controversy has a habit of driving the right audience away from a film while attracting the wrong one. Such is the case with Maniac, which had the potential to teach young women a great lesson about the dangers of trusting strange men, but ended up leaving a legion of mindless slasher flick fans with an un-satiated hunger for gore. Gore does find its way into the movie, but it's nothing spectacular by today's standards. What is spectacular is Joe's Spinell's wonderful portrayal of a psychologically disturbed murderer, and the excellent raw movie making talent of a young Bill Lustig.

Why was this movie controversial and thereby misleading? There's the cover art for the movie- a nasty almost cartoon-like rendition of the killer's hands clutching a knife and the scalp of one of his victims. One glimpse of the psychotic poster art sent feminists and uptight old ladies out in droves to protest a film that they probably never even bothered to watch. Of course, the word misogyny was thrown about to make critics feel important, sheik, and appropriately liberal among their wine and cheese eating acquaintances, but misogyny isn't the point of the film. Social ills rarely find their root in the victimization of adults, but almost always sprout from the evils that disturbed adults endured as children. Films do not cause misogyny, but abuse and the inability to cope with it does. It is the latter point that Maniac wishes to drive home, while the former remains a fantasy of the liberal limousine set and religious right.

Frank Zito, the villain, is somewhat of a novelty in modern horror in that he has a history. The physical scars on his chest give tangible evidence of his emotional ones.  We learn through his solitary babbling of insanity that his mother wasn't the June Cleaver type. She burned him with cigarettes, locked him in the closet, and prostituted herself for money. With that type of occupation, the viewer can only imagine what kind of male role models she brought home for the little boy Frank. All the viewer really knows is that the abuse has turned Zito into a monster. This is all the viewer needs to know, because this is more of a horror film than a psychological thriller, even though your everyday teenage gore-hound might leave somewhat disappointed.

In defense of gore-hounds, everyone who enjoys horror expects a certain amount of blood. Maniac delivers the gore albeit not nearly to the level that its reputation leads everyone to believe. Zito scalps one victim in full view of the camera while impaling a few others. Use of a piano wire and a shotgun dispatches a few hapless men who do nothing to protect their dates. Yes it's disgusting but no more disgusting than the ending of the mainstream film Taxi Driver. There is no mutilation of female genitalia, gutting of completely nude women, or brutal depictions of rape.  In fact, the most offensive scenes in this movie occur when Spinell removes his shirt or we get a good close up of his nasty dentures. Spinell was an ugly man, but his appearance only added to his demented fits of spittle and rage. No normal person would leave this film hating women, but normal women should leave with a hatred of weird dudes with man boobs. Good horror films are modern day fairy tales meant to scare us into being careful. If a fat greasy guy with heaving breathing doesn't already scare a young lady away from a life of prostitution, then maybe one that strangles her after the fact will.

Once prepared for the story behind the controversy, be prepared for how awful this film looks on DVD. It was shot on 16mm stock with natural lighting and blown up to 35 mm. The result is that many scenes on DVD have that ""painted"" look. The extras include a decent commentary wherein Lustig reveals some of the more amusing and ingenious ways to produce a good low budget film, and a Joe Spinell biographical documentary to educate the public of a very eccentric character actor who lived with his mother.",1151193600,4,3986,4.769565217391304
800446,5,6304147074,"In Maniac, Joe Spinell plays Frank Zito, a man haunted by abuse by his mother and by the murderous actions he takes primarilly against women (though two of the movie's victims are men).

The plot is simple, but for its time (1980), groundbreaking. It pushed the bounds of ""decency"" in that it potrayed not only a vicious killer, but that the killer was the subject of analysis. This is a departure from films such as Friday the 13th and Halloween in that those films revolved around the lead ladies who had to combat merciless killers.

I felt deeply disturbed after watching Maniac, but I felt that the grim picture it painted of mental illness and homicidal psychosis where true to the world in which we live.

Another aspect that contributes to the power of the film is that the violence is neither glorified or ""cool."" In recent films, such as the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, gore is meant to be looked at with a sense of amusement. Maniac never does this. The blood and death potrayed are ugly and depraved.

The DVD features are excellent. My favorites were the ""Gallery of Outrage"" and ""The Joe Spinell Story.""

800588,5,6304147074,"Maniac opened up in 1980 to much hatred and controversy. One critic rated maniac an h-d-bomb. Despite such despisal from womens rights groups at the time of Maniacs release, Spinells potrayal of a Maniac was very real, and Frank Zitos charachter behavior was researched in depth by actor Joe Spinell. Frank Zito is a schizophrenic, psychopathic murderer stalking the crime ridden steets of a 1979 N.Y.C. Spinell did have real talks with psyciatrists in New York city during the writing and filming of maniac to get a real life maniacs behavior into charachter Frank Zitos personality. Maniac was filmed for $250,000 in New York, November through December 1979. One of the best scenes in maniac were of Frank Zito looking into the store window at the manaquines, you see the troubled look in the window reflection on Frank Zitos face, you clearly see the range of Spinells charachter acting. Among the best scenes in the movie are simply the shots of Frank Zito in his apartment, with Jay Chattaways eerie music score, you get inside a maniacs head as you hear Frank Zito thinking his warped thoughts. You also learn part of Zitos dimentia was from his prostitute mother who was never their for him as a child, when she was there for Frank she would burn him on the chest with her cigarettes and lock young Frank in the closet while she catered to her (jons). As you watch this movie you really get to know the reason as to why Frank Zito is so mentally disordered and why he is a maniac. Despite fake blood the killings on maniac were portrayed very real on a lousy budget, Tom Savini a real vietnam veteran who saw alot of real blood in Vietnam uses his special effects from real experience with blood in vietnam to the limit in Maniac. Caroline Munro a b movie queen does a fine job in her portrayal as a professional photographer. Jay Chattaways music in my opinion made this movie. There has never been a soundtrack like this in any movie of this genre (exception Halloween 1978). Maniac will give any psych major or any doctor in the psych field a real gritty compelling view of a maniac. No one could have portrayed a better maniac than Joe Spinell. Joe researched mental behavior for Frank Zitos charachter, and as William Lustig directed this film Joe Spinell would say ""this movie will be a hit one day, people will appreciate what were doing here William"". Joe was right Maniac has gotten a cult following, I believe Maniac has generated over $10,000,000 in revenue from the movie, vhs sales to this dvd. Not bad for a $250,000 investment. I know the ending is left up in the air as there is no resolution, but as I watch the two NYPD officers bust into Franks apt. and hear Jay Chattaways brilliant musical score and than the final climax (Frank Zito opens his left eye, a powerful synthesizer key ""BOOM"" still sends shivers down my spine. The more people (reviewers) rip this cult classic the more longevity Maniac gets as a cult movie. The extras on this dvd are awesome, the Joe Spinell story is a facinating look inside of a b-movie star that if he had lived, Joe could have been the king of horror in the 1990s and into the 21st century. The trailers are incredible, the production stills the director commentary are a treat and explain things alot better than the movie could. Anchor Bay has done a fine job in the film transfer, the thx sound is incredible for a movie of this age and budget. Maniac offends the viewer, that is why it works so realistically. I really feel Maniac has gotten better with the passing of time. A Maniac portrayed brilliantly by actor Joe Spinell.

800592,5,6304147074,"Rarely does a horror film as effective, realistic, and frightening as ""Maniac"" come along.  Too many horror films glamorize the violence, or make us root for the killers (""A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge,"" ""A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,"" ""A Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,"" ""A Nightmare On Elm Street: The Dream Child,"" ""Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare,"" just to name a few) without actually touching on what makes horror scary.

""Maniac"" is different.  It's the first horror film I've seen that shows violence for what it really is: cruel, sick, wrong, terrible, disgusting.  There is no point in the movie where we're rooting for Frank Zito, the murderer of ""Maniac.""  He is a truly disturbed individual and the movie is extra scary because we know that plenty of people like him walk the streets today.

I think ""Maniac"" is a very underrated movie because for one thing, it is very well done.  Yes, it was shot on the cheap, but you can tell that care was put into it.  The low budget and hand-held camera add a certain amount of realism that can not be duplicated in the bigger budget Hollywood horror story.  William Lustig directs with a sure hand, and there are plenty of memorable scenes that stick in your head forever.  The scene where Frank Zito scalps a hooker in a hotel room is positively terrifying, and the entrance of Caroline Munro into the movie is handled especially nicely.  The best scene is without a doubt the one in which Frank chases a nurse down into the subway and into the men's room, where he sniffs her out like an animal sniffing out prey.  The scene is long and suspenseful and incredibly nerve-wracking, and Kelly Piper gives one of the best depictions of complete and utter terror ever put on film.

Speaking of which, it is the acting in this movie that really elevates it over some of the other cheesy horrors of the '80s.  The star of the movie is Joe Spinell, and there is no debating that.  Most people only know Spinell from his bit parts in such movies as ""The Godfather,"" ""The Godfather: Part II,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Rocky,"" or ""Rocky II,"" but this movie proves without a doubt that the man had major acting chops.  He engulfs himself in the Frank Zito character, so much that we start to believe we are watching a real serial kiler at work here.  Spinell also does an incredible thing by managing to gain a little sympathy from us despite all the terrible things we watch him do.  That takes talent, my friends.  He dominates the movie.  Caroline Munro is very sweet and loveable in her part as photographer Anna D'Antoni.  The rest of the actors do good, but don't stand out especially with Spinell in the lead.

The effects are what have made the movie famous, and may I say this is prehaps the best Tom Savini has ever given us.  The effects here are disgusting and amazingly realistic.  Everyone's heard of the exploding head, but that's not all.  The scalpings and stabbings and myriad other violent acts are all presented in their uncensored glory and look mightily real.  Great work, Mr. Savini!

""Maniac"" was previously available on DVD from Elite Enterainment, but Anchor Bay rereleased it in a rather wonderful DVD set which you could also get as a limited edition with an extra disc (shaped like Spinell's head and featuring music from the movie) and enclosed in a tin case.  I love those limited editions, so I managed to get myself a copy of the tin edition (I bought it right here from good old Amazon.com, used and for a very reasonable price) and it's a wonderful set.  Anchor Bay put a lot of clear effort into the features.  We get the excellent commentary (from the laserdisk and previous Elite DVD) which is really quite funny while also giving plenty of good information.  Also, there is a very, very, very touching documentary called, ""The Joe Spinell Story.""  The great actor finally gets the respect he deserves in this 50 minute piece where friends, family, and coworkers gather to discuss the talented Mr. Spinell.  It's a brutally honest documentary and pulls no punches when it comes to discussing Spinell's flaws, among them alcohol and drug abuse.  We also get a 19 minute radio interview from 1980 with William Lustig, Joe Spinell, and Caroline Munro that is rather nice, and gives a good oportunity to hear the quick wit of Spinell.

Finally, we get all the marketing materials you could ask for.  All the trailers and TV spots are collected and we also get a very funny 'gallery of outrage.'  Here, you can read what some of the critics thought about ""Maniac,"" and it's all rather amusing.

I don't think I've seen a more underrated movie than ""Maniac.""  Some people just don't get it, and some are put off by the realism and grotesque violence, but trust me, this is a well made, frightening, and incredibly acted movie that'll stay in your head long after viewing.  One of the best horror movies ever.  Easily recommended.",1138406400,6,4948,4.660899653979238

I couldn't stop watching it, I didn't even want to check what time it was, I was just so in to it. This movie is great. I love this movie. It is now my second favorite movie of all time, behind Halloween. This movie is absolutely insane. It's about a man who was tortured by his mom as a kid, and now he spends his life cutting the scalps off women, and then puts them on manicans in his house. I don't love this movie because he kills women, I just love a great horror movie, and this is definitely one. This movie has a real good feel to it. Joe Spinell is a great actor in this movie, he plays the part very well, but Im sure this movie wouldn't be half as good without the effects. Tom Savini is the god of all effects, he really shows what he can do in this movie. The shotgun scene is crazy, I believe its one of the best scenes in a horror movie ever.

Chock-full of blood, gruesome special effects and violent deaths, Tom Savini delivers another gem. Whether or not you like the story-- it's really good, and really well written, the blood makes the movie more than worth watching. Joe Spinell delivers a stunning performance. The overall feel to this movie is definitively a slasher feel, cold, secluded and you can almost smell the stench of Frank's apartment.

[the bad]

Really the only bad thing about this movie is the ending, I really didn't care for it at all. I know that he had to have died in the end, there was no going different. I just felt it could have been much more different. To me, it seems that the ending was threw in because they lacked any really good ideas for an ending.

[final thoughts]

It's really hard to not watch any movie that Tom Savini goes special make-up effects for, we all know that there will be blood, well done deaths, and realistic life-casts. This movie was no different, and it actually had a great plot and a well directed movie to go with it. This movie would have no doubt even worked without the blood, and without the violence. It was that interesting. It really is the typical bloody 1980's Savini-esque slasher, but with great directing and a great story, something that alot of the other 1980's slashers severely lacked.",1137283200,,1336,4.6923076923076925

800715,4,6304147074,"Bill Lustig coaxed a lifetime-great performance from Joe Spinell in the compelling, but thoroughly unpleasent gore-fest that is Maniac.

Whilst the blood 'n guts in a Romero or Fulcio horror is so OTT as to provide comedy value as well as shocks, the gore in Maniac feels so real (courtesy of Tom Savini in expert form) as to make the viewer feel uncomfortably like a guilty voyeur at the scene of something exceedingly nasty.

As an insight into a profoundly troubled mind and the shocking consequences of horrific childhood abuse (more hinted at than explained), Maniac also works pretty well.  It cleverly treds the fine line between the viewer understanding what has made Frank Zito (Spinell) into the monster he became, whilst never sympathising with the appalling acts he commits.

Somewhat surprisingly for a low-budget movie in the gore-fest/video nasty category, Maniac is rather well acted. Spinell himself is scarily believable. The actress (sorry not sure of her name) in the extended toilet scene gives one of the most convincing  depictions of utter terror ever seen. Whilst it is perhaps a little far fetched that anyone could fall for the dubious charms of Frank Zito, Caroline Munro plays a blinder as the beautiful, talented (if somewhat naive) photographer.

So, in my humble opinion, it is the sheer realism and honesty of Maniac that makes it work.  On the occasions when it descends into more a supernatural horror style (including one scene in the cemetary ripped unashamedly from Carrie, and the final scene with the mannequins) its potency becomes diluted.

Enough quibling though. Fans of the genre will surely acknowledge Maniac as a very effective and truly disturbing horror movie.

The DVD is reasonably well-equipped. The remastered picture quality and sound are as good as you'd expect, the documentary about Spinell is fascinating and poignant, the director's commentary is insightful and amusing, and the critics' outraged reviews are hilarious.

The whole time i was thinking is this guy really insane? Either this guy is a genius actor or hes really nuts. Thats how real he is in this role. His presance will creep you out. Hes the biggest weirdo Ive ever seen on film. Hes worse than any monster, supernatural being, horror villain because hes so real and gritty. You don't want to think about it but you know that somewhere out there- people like this exist...

 The story focuses on frank the serial killer and his killings and insanity. He calmly stalks his pray through the streets of NYC. I don't know how he manages to fool some of the people in this film but he does. They treat him like a normal guy until he trys to kill them when they least expect it.

Some of the scenes are grusome, but they will keep you on the edge of your seat. You will be able to put yourself in both franks shoes and feel the victims terror as she is stalked and hides from Frank... Especially the subway bathroom scene. Thats an intense scene. Frank keeps on killing till the end when his own demons finally come back to haunt him.

Frank Zito(Spinell) is a demented serial killer, roaming the streets of New York, scalping hookers, models, or any other woman he sees in ""honor"" of his prostitute mother.

An excessively charged musical score by Jay Chattaway, decent acting and nice direction by Lustig.

Known for it's great splatter effects by Tom Savini(Evil Dead) who disowned the film then later joined Lustig for laser disc commentary. ""Maniac"" delivers for gore hounds. Scalpings, decapitations, stabbings, and of course the classic gunshot to the head scene is the highlight of this film!

801007,4,6304147074,"The central debate surrounding this movie seems to be whether or not it rises above the level of the common slasher movie.  Naturally, this is a subjective notion, so it can't be definitively proven, but I think it does.  I don't think it really is trying to be a a deep or complicated film, but I think it manages a certain level of intensity uncommon to the slasher film.  Whether or not this is true for you is a more difficult question.  There are a great many horror fans out there who seem to find it impossible to take horror films seriously, and enjoy them on a purely camp or light-hearted level.(Not to say that enjoying horror films in this way is inherently bad, though I'd say that there are plenty that are worthy of genuine praise)  If you are one of this sort you will doubtless think of this as 'just another slasher movie', and may or may not find it terribly enjoyable.  Those of you who, like myself, can frequently take horror films seriously, may find a lot to admire here.  Either way, I think this is a good film.

Many people out there have complained about the script, to which I respond, 'what script?'.  Pretty much all there is to it is this: Zito stalks, Zito kills, Zito sits in his apartment, Zito hangs out with photographer chick, climax, the end.  But yeah, what script there is isn't terribly impressive on any level.  Major debate surrouds Spinell's performance, as he is generally accused of being either great or terrible.  I tend to come down in the middle.  I think he's generally pretty good, though he does go a bit over the top some times.  I'm not gonna say his performance is necessarily unbelievable, as what I know of serial killers and psychotics leads me to believe that they could behave in any manner, no matter how outrageous or odd, but he's occasionally to weird or wimpering to be effective, regardless of whether or not the behavior reflects reality.  However, he's more good than bad, I think, particularly in the low-key scenes.(And despite what the critics may tell you of his scenery-chewing, 90% of the scenes he's in are low-key)  Admittedly, I don't think there's a whole helluva to his acting in these scenes, but it works.  The rest of the performances aren't great, but they are given so little emphasis that they barely matter.(However, the voice acting in the audio flashback is indeed terrible, as is the dialogue. Definitely one of the film's weakpoints.

Suggestions that this film is misognynistic are pretty ridiculous.(And offensive, since the way people go on and on about violence against women suggests that women are just a whole helluva lot more important than men, especially when you consider that men are murdered at about 3 times the rate that women are.)  First of all, there are 7 onscreen victims, 3 male, 4 female.  Second, the 2 most violent and gruesome deaths in the film, as well as the one which I consider to be the most painful looking of all are reserved for the men  Furthermore, the violence in this film is harsh and grotesque, far from pleasant and never portrayed as something 'fun'.(Of course, I don't think that films with wacky, fun violence are dangerous either, but the notion that that sort of movie is potentially dangerous is ever so slightly more believable)  Hell, Zito himself doesn't enjoy it, exemplified by the hesitancy he shows, his all too apparent self-hatred and his reactions to his own deeds.(i.e. when he runs off to vomit after committing murder)  Furthermore, Zito is not exactly the sorta character most people are going to admire, his murderous nature aside, as he is a fat, greasy, lonely and depressed slob.  I admit that this film *might* cater to the tastes of those who have murderous impulses, but it's hard to imagine how it might create these desires.  Certainly, this is still an exploitation film which wallows in violence(exemplified by its less than classy artwork), but I think it is primarily interested in exploiting people's perhaps slightly perverse obsession with serial killers, rather than one's secret desire to be one.  Of course, none of this is gonna convince anyone who believes otherwise, but I can't help defending it.

Naturally, this is an extraordinarily desolate and dank picture, to go along with the violence.  Pretty much the whole film is grimey, and most of it is dark, but in a stark, blunt fashion rather than a sort of stylized urban wasteland.  The direction is relatively flat, appropriate for the subject matter, and the music is ominous and very low-key for the most part.  The first 3 murder scenes follow in rapid sucession, and are all fairly effective in their own way.  The first gives a real sense of how I'd think most serial killers would operate, as it is just so sudden, random and brutal.  Zito's murder of a prostitute is disturbing in its setup, as he just lies on the bed and watches her pose for him in her leotard type outfit. I don't quite know why that part is so effective, but it is.  The much famed and rightly praised stalking scene in the subway station is extremely intense, despite the viewers knowledge that any encounter is almost certain to end in the death of the potential victim.  Zito's eventual hallucination that the mannequins in his apartment come to life and assail him is quite unnerving as well.(Though it gets a little weird and weakens a bit as the scene goes on. It starts off great, though)

This film is not as gory as it's made out to be, but it's still pretty brutal and frank in it's deciptions of violence.  The most famous scene is where Tom Savini has his head blown-apart by a shotgun, an effect which is commonly cited as the best head explosion in film. Personally, it was a little disappointing, and nowhere near as cool as the head-explosion in Scanners.  It is an impressive effect, however, and it is actually more effective in the context of the film, as the more classic head explosions tend to elicit laughter, which wouldn't have been appropriate.  The much famed scalpings aren't as unnerving as advertised.  The actually cutting isn't very effective, but it is quite painful when he starts to pull back the skin.  The violence really gets going in the closing scenes, but not so much so that it becomes to over-the-top, and thus campy or funny. The gore fx isn't up to modern-day standards of realism, but it still holds up quite well for the most part,(and much better than most of its contemporaries) and thus it doesn't ever detract much from the film.

This isn't exactly the funnest movie I've ever seen, but it is fairly tense and compelling.  Horror fans should at least see this, and then they can draw their own conclusions.",1101168000,,6666,4.701376936316695

There are some horror/slasher movies that I love, due to the intensity; ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" come to mind comes to mind.

Then there are the movies that are just disturbing, movies so rotten to the core that I just don't appreciate; ""Maniac"" is one of them.",1100908800,2,384,4.701492537313433
801010,3,6304147074,"The first time I saw MANIAC I was really bummed out. I love slasher movies and MANIAC is just a real downer. There's no JOY in this movie to speak of. It's like the polar opposite of EVIL DEAD 2 - a grim, sick journey through the mind of a freak with a mommy fetish.

Now if you are a gore freak then this movie represents total nirvana. Savini's effects are amazingly realistic - there's no way any filmmaker could get away with this stuff these days. NO WAY! This movie must have gone out unrated.

I saw it overseas years ago on VHS and it was edited pretty heavily. Not this DVD - every sick frame is included for your enjoyment. You gotta admire Savini's genius. It's amazing stuff. My fave moment is when he blows his own head off with a shotgun - nice.

Just remember - it's a joyless little excursion into depravity but if you're into that kind of thing you can't go past this movie. This would have to rank up there as one of the most sadistic pictures to come out of the US during the 80s.

Great poster art for this movie.

Enjoy....",1091491200,8,1044,4.2
801011,2,6304147074,"I'm sorry, but this IS just another 80's slasher flick.  There is nothing outstanding about Maniac - nothing that elevates it or distinguishes it from all the other films of this type to come out during this decade.  I simply do not understand the reverence felt by many horror fans for this silly, low-budget schlock.  I know I will get slammed with non-helpful votes from people who have already seen it and like it, (in which case I don't see how my review could be helpful or otherwise...) but I hope to possibly dissuade others from making the same mistake I did by purchasing this movie.
Joe Spinell plays Frank Zito, our whining, groaning, grunting maniac.  His Mommy locked him in a closet a lot when he was a child and turned him into a self-hating misogynist - well, that and a homicidal schizophrenic.  Frank scalps his victims and uses these scalps as wigs for his beloved mannequins.  That's the premise.  There is also a lazy attempt at a story involving a beautiful photographer who I suppose represents redemption?  Rehabilitation?  A last chance for the violent schizo to rejoin civilized society?
The script is pretty awful and it's interpretation by the actors does not help matters.  Spinell's performance is hokey and self-conscious.  However, contrasted with his supporting cast (I think the mannequines gave better performances than Caroline Munroe) he is friggin Olivier.
The scene in which Zito stalks and kills the nurse is the most effective sequence in the film.  However, it is nearly ruined by completely unnecessary and ridiculous over-dubbing.  Whatever the problems with live sound might have been, silence would have worked better.  This superfluous dubbing of grunts, gasps, whimpers and heavy breathing does not add to, but rather negates completely, the desired effect of suspense and dread.  The same goes for the voiceover (in lieu of flashback) that explains the abuse Frank suffered from his mother:
Little Frank (played by worst child actor in the world): ""No Mommy, please.  Please don't lock me in the closet.""
Mommy (played by worst actress in the history of theatre):  ""You must be punished.  You have been bad again.""
Little Frank:  ""No Mommy, please.  Please, please don't lock me in the closet.  Please.
Mommy:  ""You must be punished.  You have been bad..."" and on and on and on.  There are other embarrassing moments in the film, but this one is special.
Tom Savini's effects are very good, although the movie is not nearly as gory as I expected it to be.  Some of the shots of the mannequines at the end are nice.  But overall, the gritty, nasty feel that was so obviously desired was sabotaged by a bad script and bad acting.  Great acting is not essential for a good low-budget movie.  But if the acting is bad, then your script must be fantastic, or your premise, or your visuals, or something.  There is some good gore here.  That's about it.
If you want to see a dark, gritty, and excellent movie about a serial killer, rent or buy Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.  Abel Ferrara's Driller Killer is not bad either.",1088812800,9,3073,4.818355640535373

It's gory of course, with a lot of blood and repulsive scenes. But there is something about the dark, diabolic eyes of the killer (Joe Spinell), not to mention the constant moaning, which makes him a very creepy character.

I loved it!",1079568000,,315,5.076923076923077
801104,4,6304147074,"Another all-but-forgotten drive in gem of early 80s trash cinema.  Maniac has no redeeming qualities, taste, or message to get across to you......and frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way.  The movie's nothing more than a series of gruesome murders committed by our ""maniac"".  Even though this is true, you can't help but think as you watch this that there are many similar ""Frank Zito's"" prowling the streets in cities all over the world.  It may not be a true story, but ironically, it's all too true.  The movie was trashed by the media and feminist groups upon it's release(the dvd even has a feature called ""Gallery Of Outrage"" where you can read all of the negative press clippings of this film.  A fantastic bonus feature.)for it's depictions of violence against women(I guess no one cared about the poor schmuck who gets his head blown off, which is clearly the most gruesome image in the film).  This always gives me a chuckle, coz it gives the film some major publicity and free advertising that most directors could only dream of.  I was too young when this came out, but I remember a similar uproar when Silent Night, Deadly Night hit theaters around Christmas time.  And I'll tell ya, all it made me want to do is see it more.  Sure, Maniac is gory and violent, but I've seen much worse.  And if you're a horror fan, I'm sure you have too.  One big reason I enjoyed this was Spinnell's convincing performance.  These days, serial killers in film are always sly, sophisticated, almost classy(like Silence Of The Lambs and Seven, etc.).  Frank Zito is what I imagine most serial killers to be like:  Lonely, scummy, pathetic.  Spinnell's performance makes this very believable.  Yes, this film is ugly, gruesome, depressing, disturbing.....but how else should a serial killer be portrayed?",1075852800,2,1804,4.805194805194805
801105,5,6304147074,"This serial killer movie may not be appreciated by most for its amateur film-school type production. The film was shot on 16mm and presented as a 35mm blow-up making the quality somewhere close to what you have seen in The Blair Witch Project. However if you can get past the look and low production values then you will find it is much better than most for its type. Probably the most astonishing thing about this low-budget production is the quality of the visual gore effects brought to life by Tom Savini who even has his very own bloody cameo in this movie. There is a scene at the start of this film involving a shotgun that has to be one the best in the business.
Essentially this is a film that follows a serial killer, Frank Zito (Joe Spinell) around New York as he performs a number of grisly murders and plenty of female stalking. Much of these sequences are over-the-top as heads explode and people are literally ripped apart. However others can be quite flat and not as violent as you would have expected given all the hype about this slaughterhouse motion picture.
Where the film nearly fails is in the actual performance of the lead killer because he does the age old routine of talking to himself, rocking himself and generally overplaying the nut, but after awhile he does manage to improve by simply taking his weirdness to a few other levels. It is hard to imagine that his current condition would allow him to go unnoticed as he piles up the body count but yet again this is New York we are talking about here so the custom of minding your own business may allow for it. At one stage in this movie he manages to actually break out of his shell doing an art-critic routine and you actually feel that there may be some hope left for this urban monster. It is sort of funny that you want to see him become ""well again"" even though he is a violent sexual murderer. Another thing that the viewer should know is that the actual poster for this movie does nothing for what the killer looks like as his face and physique are somewhat obscured. When you see this film you will be completely taken aback by what kind of a character is actually behind this movie which was banned in several countries.
It is hard to really pin point what makes Maniac so disturbing. You can not really indicate any one part of it and say ""that is one that makes this so brutal"" or ""this is why it got banned"". Even if you where to edit the violent and gory parts together you will find that it is quite limited by today's standards. This film is really as grisly, gory and violent as what you have imagined it to be but why this film should have been axed when various zombie movies have done much more gore in ten minutes is something to consider. You will certainly find much more gory films out there but maybe not as many crazy ones. This movie is pretty messed up in the head in more ways than one and this is really why it got the banning treatment. When you view the film as a whole you can then see why so many countries refused to release it. You could not just cut one scene and say - ""There, now it is tamed."" That would not really restrain it all. There is something more psychological about it. Our serial killer alludes to the fact that he was sexually abused and tortured as a child. His mother plays as a dominant figure in his mind. It is the childlike characteristics of this movie that make it distressing. If the killer was ten years of age then by God this film would be very controversial indeed... and this is really why it does upset most who watch it because behind the face of Frank Zito is a child in a man's body. A child who is doing those terrible things to women.
This film is also a real jumper and at times you will be hard pressed not to fall out of your chair as our protagonist scares the willies out of a lot of his victims before he does away with them. One film that is very similar in nature and feel to this movie is Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. In short, Maniac is everything you can expect it to be and then some more. It is not really as ultra-gory from start to finish as you would expect but when the blood flows it gushes deep red. This is a cult classic that should not be overlooked for its low production values.",1073347200,5,4261,4.294409937888199

801107,5,6304147074,"In May of 2002, I went to the Dover Mall during a long break between my classes at Delaware Tech and bought a VHS copy of MANIAC, a movie which has piqued my curiosity for a long time. So when I came back to Delaware Tech, I watched MANIAC on one of the TV/VCR machines in the library (with headphones), and I was hooked. Weeks later, I started watching it late at night when nobody was around; it became my new horror movie addiction, with my first being THE EVIL DEAD. About a year later, the Limited Edition DVD became my very first purchase from Amazon.com (and what an exciting Saturday morning it was when I received it in the mail!).
Having studied abnormal psychology during my first two years at Delaware Tech, I found MANIAC to be more intelligent than all the other slasher movies in its time. Joe Spinell did an excellent job at portraying Frank Zito, the title character; the monologues and soliloquies throughout the movie are exactly what goes through the mind of any serial killer out there. Also, the child abuse subtext of the movie (a subtle one, thank God) is perfectly tangible, as any child who experiences any kind of emotional, physical, or worse mistreatment might be shaped into becoming a murderer or criminal. Plus, the gory set-pieces, courtesy of the great Tom Savini (who I met in August at the Horrorfind convention in Maryland), are among his greatest work and they fit perfectly with the tone of the movie (Just check out the scene where his head gets blown off!). The highlight is the subway sequence, which rivals any one of Brian DePalma's constant Hitchcock homages (1980 was the year of DRESSED TO KILL, his greatest Hitchcock homage!), and the scene following it when Frank is dressing another mannequin, which is a great example of black humor. All told, MANIAC is like a hybrid of FRIDAY THE 13TH and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE; it was too strong for some to stomach in 1980 and remains potent today, thus MANIAC is an acquired taste.
The DVD is one of Anchor Bay Entertainment's greatest efforts (after all, the director of the movie was working for the label). The commentary, by said director, Savini, the editor, and Spinell's best friend and personal assistant, is very enlightening to those familiar with the controversy surrounding the movie even today and amusing at times. Plus, ""The Joe Spinell Story"" is one of Anchor Bay's greatest documentaries ever assembled for supplemental material, as it provides real insight as to the distinguished career of this late, great character actor. Also, there's every trailer, TV spot, and radio spot for this movie, along with a radio interview with Spinell, Caroline Munro, and the director. The Limited Edition is definetly a MUST for the real fans out there, mainly for the excellent soundtrack CD (shaped like Spinell's head!) and tin case; you get to hear one of Zito's soliloquies on one of the tracks! A brutal and ground-breaking horror movie, MANIAC is a definite must-watch for horror buffs!",1070755200,2,2984,4.807392996108949
801108,1,6304147074,"I read the customer reviews for this movie and I was so excited about watching this.  I had such high hopes, what a HUGE disappoinmet this movie was.  Seeing that is is a cult classic, I expected that there would be no plot, which that held true, but I was prepared for this movie to turn my stomach.  This is the unrated version so I am curious as to what the ""R"" rated version would have been like.  There were maybe one or two really good gore scences that is even worth watching, however it did not turn my stomach.  I personally thought Final Destination 2 had more of a gore factor than this did.  Maybe the fact that this was made in the 80's might make a difference, but all in all I felt that I wasted money on a movie that is not worth seeing again let alone owning.",1059436800,8,776,4.105960264900662
801109,5,6304147074,"Frank Zito is your average, everyday sort of loser. He lives in a total dive of an apartment, surrounded by decaying memories of his childhood and his long dead mother. Moreover, Frank's physical appearance leaves a lot to be desired: he's overweight, sweaty, with a pockmarked face and greasy black hair. He bears a striking resemblance, in fact, to adult film star Ron Jeremy. Frank's biggest problem in life concerns his relationships with women. He doesn't have any, for one thing, and the interactions he does have with the opposite sex would set the teeth of the worst among us on edge. For Frank Zito is a serial killer goaded into the darkest crimes of the human mind by the memory of his mother and a voice in his head that drives him to wanton acts of violence. Frank is remorseful after a murder; he knows what he is doing to women causes others to recoil in horror, but he just cannot help himself. Frank placates his inner demons to some extent by scalping his victims and hammering the hair on mannequins he stores in his apartment. As Frank's shenanigans plunge the city into fear stricken turmoil, he continues his bloody reign of carnage while always carrying the knowledge that the authorities stand a good chance of catching up to him. Then Frank meets up with the beautiful Anna, a fashion photographer played by the amazingly beautiful Caroline Munro. At this point, ""Maniac"" teeters on the edge of complete banality, as the relationship between these two is forced and totally unbelievable. Fortunately, Frank continues his activities while dating Anna, activities that lead to an unremittingly dismal end (maybe?) for Frank.
Frank Zito is the ""Maniac"" in this 1980 grindhouse film classic directed by William Lustig of ""Maniac Cop"" fame. Zito, played by the late character actor Joe Spinnell (you can see him several times in the first two Godfather films), helped write the script for this engrossing, and gross, film. ""Maniac"" is difficult to classify: sometimes it easily falls into the classic slasher film genre, but at other times it seems closer to exploitation. Perhaps the classification of ""Maniac"" isn't too important because whatever genre it falls into this movie is a brilliant, memorable piece of sleaze filmmaking. While you can easily tell that Lusting and Spinnell made this film on a shoestring budget, the cheapness of the production adds to the bleak storyline. Zito's exterior life is sleazy because his mind is damaged beyond repair. The blasted landscape of late 1970s New York provides the perfect backdrop for Frank's gruesome excursions in search of victims. These stalk and splatter incidents provide most of the atmospheric tension of ""Maniac,"" with the standout scene concerning a nurse trapped in the subway late at night with Zito in merciless pursuit. This stalking scene is so fraught with suspense that it literally has the viewer on the edge of his seat. Add to these vistas of carnage a great music score and ""Maniac"" is a grade A winner in the sleaze category. I have often felt like taking a shower after watching this movie.
Real gorehounds love ""Maniac"" for the over the top grue scenes provided by none other than special effects master Tom Savini. The ultimate scene involves Savini himself playing a guy who takes his date to a park for some risqu fun. Unknown to these two lovers, Zito follows them from a restaurant toting a double-barreled shotgun. As the scene unfolds, we see Zito launch himself on the hood of the car and deliver a deathblow through the windshield. The subsequent effect of Savini's exploding head ranks as one of the most amazing special effects in horror film history, easily matching the head burst in Cronenberg's ""Scanners."" What really creeps a person out about this scene is thinking about Savini orchestrating his own gory demise. Well, he gave himself one of the most memorable sendoffs in film history. This scene never loses its intensity no matter how many times one watches it. ""Maniac"" doesn't rely solely on this scene, as other scenes throughout the movie repeatedly deliver impressive effects. This movie is not for the lighthearted in any way, shape, or form.
I recommend potential buyers pick up the DVD instead of this VHS version. It looks like there are numerous goodies on the disc that appear nowhere on the tape edition. There are bonuses here: more than a few trailers and television spots shown after the film, a few of which are in French and German, a trailer for a sequel that never got off the ground called ""Mr. Robbie,"" and a deleted scene showing Frank and Anna on a date in a restaurant. As good as the picture quality on the VHS is, I am willing to bet the DVD version is even better. Still, either version is worth watching as long as you make sure to get the unrated print of the film. You don't want to miss out on any of the unpleasantness in this amazing contribution to the horror genre.",1057795200,4,4919,4.822485207100592

801112,5,6304147074,"Finally at long last Joe Spinnel's clasic tale of a deranged serial killer has finally been released in a worthy form.
Being that many movies have used this title I must explain that this one is not only the real deal but the most vile of the pack. It is a extremely creepy low budget gore flick with absoloutely no moral perspective, So much so that even its own makeup artist wanted to be removed from its credits. Tom Savini, who would later become famous for his award winning FX as well as acting and directing many later horror films, Brings to the table some of the most realistic FX in his career and is one of the many highlights in this classic horror film.
 Like it is in many real life serial killer cases, we have the late Joe Spinnel, who potrays the serial killer Frank Zito, a loner with no social grace or personality. Frank is severely mentally disturbed as a result of the emotional and physical abuse he suffered as a child at the hands of his prostitute mother. The murder scenes in this movie are extremely cruel and graphic in nature so I must warn you that this film is defenitely not for everybody.
Most casual horror fans tend to wretch at this film and see it as nothing more than a seedy slasher flick that has a very anti-woman message, but in my opinion it is much more than that. It is a potrayal of one of society's worst monsters, monsters who often walk around our every day world going unnoticed.
So in conclusion, if you are a die-hard horror fan and love gruesome effects, then I highly suggest you purchase this dvd. Out of all the DVD's that Anchor Bay has released, this would have to be the cream of the crop, boasting a plethora of special features, and a heartfelt tribute to the late Joe Spinnel.",1046304000,12,1740,4.386996904024768
801247,2,6304147074,"Minor Spoilers, though it really doesn't matter that much (who's watching this for story and character development?)
William Lustig has not had what you might call a glittering career, with the pretty flaccid 'maniac cop' probably being his directorial highlight. I'm not going to voice off too much about this sleazy little story of insanity and copious scalpings, except to say that it is very nasty and unpleasant, at times intensely so. It's also extremely graphic and the death scenes are so protacted that eventually the blood, screaming and torture just numb you. I decided to put this matter of factly, because for some people these qualities are a major incentive to see a film and for others, who were maybe looking for something a bit more light-hearted like 'Scream' or 'Urban Legend', it's a good indication that you might want to give this one a miss.
I personally didn't enjoy it very much, and I'm a big fan of exploitation and extreme cinema. This was largely due to the fact that the film is badly structured and frequently dull. The main character commits some vile atrocity (nice FX work from Savini, as always, with a particularly impressive gunshot wound to the head a la 'Dawn of the Dead'), weeps a bit then returns to his flat and conducts some kind of internal dialogue with himself. This pattern is repeated OVER and OVER until Lustig is satisfied that the audience understands that he's sincerely trying to get inside the mind of a sick weirdo and make a thought provoking psychological chiller, not cheesily exploit human misery for a quick buck.
Eventually through circumsatnce he ends up in a Graveyard, having some kind of hallucinatory conversation with his dead mother. This provides us with some of the worst voice over work ever heard in a motion picture, especially the child who repeats endlessly 'Please, mommy, don't lock me in the closet' in a monotone that even Fox Mulder would find a tad wooden. This lame-brained (make that lobotomized) attempt at cause and effect (abuse spawns an abuser) seems completely vacuous and tacked on in light of the rest of the movie's gloating sadism and lingering attention to gory detail.
On which note the movie ends with an exceedingly repellant dream sequence which may have been cut in another version (the local British VHS release) I recently saw. Certain bits of sexualized violence certainly were, particularly the strangulation of the prostitute which even when trimmed down still seems to go on for ever, and some vaguely sexual knife wounding. All of which makes Maniac sound like such a pleasant viewing experience, something for the whole family to snuggle up to after church on Sunday with a bottle of mescal and a bucket.
If you're a sick puppy (you know you are) you'll probably get a kick out of it, although you may find that you don't watch it very often (or have to start taking showers after it). Everyone else would do well to avoid it like a debilitating brain aneuryism.

This film was interesting to say the least. I thought that the actor playing the maniac was quite good. However there were long moments in the movie that were devoid of anything interesting visually and the voice overs were a little excessive. This is the reason I only gave the movie 3 stars.
There are quite a few good gore scenes though and the story is believeable until the end which is is a little bit odd due to the supernatural aspects of it.
Over all this is an interesting movie and a classic slasher flick. I recommend it for fans of gore and serial killer stories.

The story of a deranged maniac who kills women and collects their scalps for his apartment full of manniquins stars Joe Spinell as the maniac and Caroline Munro as a photographer he takes a liking to. That the beautiful Munro would even give this slob the time of day much less friendship of any kind is a stretch. That's just one of the issues here. The murders and scalpings are another issue. I found them to be nauseating and difficult to tolerate. The film is very low budget and poorly made which gives it a gritty edge that makes the gore seem voyeuristic in nature. Savini's gore effects are vivid and somewhat realistic. The psychological probes into the mind of this sicko are not handled as effectively as the carnage. Had the balance been more even the movie could have had more impact. As it is, this is a film that glorifies mutilating women for the gore thrill. It at times approaches what a ""snuff"" film must be like. Anchor Bay devotes loving attention to the DVD with lots of extras and a tribute to Spinell.

801253,3,6304147074,"People either regard Maniac as a realistic portrait of a serial killer, or an offensive piece of absolute trash.

Both criticisms are understandable.  Joe Spinell is entirely believable as a sick, depraved madman.  Perhaps too believable.  Serial killers in the movies are usually a lot more slick, a lot more likeable even.  But this is not Hannibal Lecter.  This is not entertainment, like those films.  This is...demented.

The film feels genuinely sleazy, from the color scheme to the camera work to the fact that they used adult actresses as victims to save some cash on the budget.

Spinell plays a dirty, sweaty, fat slob named Frank Zito.  He looks like a guy you might see on the subway and avoid eye contact with.  But Frank also happens to be an insane serial killer.  The problem is that the film has the character, has the actor, and does little with them.  There's a ridiculous plot involving Frank's meeting with a gorgeous photographer--he even just shows up at her apartment out of nowhere, yet she takes a liking to him.  She even agrees to 'stop by' the cemetary on the way to dinner so Frank can drop a wreath on his mother's grave.  Only then does Frank reveal that he's less than sane, as he screams 'MOTHERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!' in the dark and foggy graveyard.

I don't know why Spinell couldn't patch this up with some better plot writing.  He has some seriously dark and demented monologues as Frank tortures himself over behavior he knows is wrong but cannot stop.  He could have made more of an effort to show something happening, and even the meeting with the photographer could have been slightly more realistic with some better writing.

It's a hard if not impossible film to recommend.  I don't quite know if it qualifies as 'entertainment'.  The DVD does have a ton of extras though, including a documentary on Spinell, a beloved character actor and New York-type.  The commentary is also very good--Lustig and Savini recall the guerilla style of filming without permits, making them rush out of locations before the cops could show up.

A sick and demented and very gory horror film, Maniac features one of the creepiest and most memorable serial killers on film.  This is literally the story of the lone madman who stalks random people in dark alleys, or subway stations (a good, tense sequence).  Also, Tom Savini's exploding cranium is quite impressive.",1021248000,3,2397,4.859259259259259

Without Bill Lustig, most of Dario Argento's work may not be on DVD. You can thank him for that. But anyway, MANIAC could be considered either the beginning of the end to American horror films or as headway to an American fascination with the commercial slasher films. Character actor Joe Spinell plays Frank, a 40-something average guy who is dealing with his childhood abuse that his incestual (?) mother inflicted on him. Even though she has passed on, Frank releases his anger by making nightly trips within Manhattan, ...[brutally killing people] Joe Spinell's performance as Frank in his 'tortured' moments seems a but funny at first, and maybe they are suppsosed to be. How many times have we seen that crazy guy on the subway talking to himself late at night?

If you're looking for gore, there is really only one good scene: special effects icon Tom Savini (playing a sleezey guy trying to score in his car) has the ""maniac"" blow his head off. Ok, so Tom Savini exploding his own head makes this movie worth seeing.  (It is definitely a quality head explosion, for those keeping score.) If that's not your cup a tea, though, another good reason that cult fans would want to see this is that it was the first slasher movie to tell the story from the point of the killer.  (Hence ""Pivotal slasher flick."") It's a historical piece, if nothing else.  If you're not interested in any of these elements and just want to see a creepy movie, it is also pretty creepy. As a slasher movie, it definitely towers over the Nightmare series and the Friday series.  The character is very realistic, somewhere between an ugly Ted Bundy, David Berkowitz and Ed Gein.  Also reminescent of Psycho's Norman Bates, the maniac (named Frank Zito) has a sort of guilt complex stemming from his childhood with his mother.  It somehow has turned him into a perverted, compulsive sex offender and murderer as well as a delusional schizophrenic.  He spontanteously decides to attack ordinary women and prostitutes, rapes/kills them and takes their scalps (and sometimes other articles) as souveniers which he uses to decorate manequins in his cramped, dingy apartment.

801338,4,6304147074,"I saw this film back in 1983 (when I was 13 years old) on VHS video and it was one of the scariest films I have seen in that time. I do remember when this film was theatrically released on November 25, 1981; which only stayed out for 6 days as the film received outcry by Women's and Parents' Groups who claimed the film degrades women. The films' distributor (Analysis Pictures) nicely pulled the film from theatres and has became way popular on video.
  MANIAC is a great film, but shown in a very cardboard way. It's about a serial killer Frank Zito (Joe Spinelli) who preys on victims (mostly women) in NYC. He kills, scalps his victims, takes their clothes and displays them in his small studio apartment. That is what MANIAC basically entails. However, MANIAC does have a backstory to it in which Frank Zito was savagely abused by his mommy who was a prostitute who was later killed in a car accident. This backstory was not told too well, but if this was the case in a visual manner, MANIAC would have been an fully effective film.
  MANIAC, directed by William Lustig was his first and best film. The effects by Tom Savini (who just came from the Friday the 13th set) were top notch. The music by Jay Chattaway added to the creepiness of MANIAC, also top notch. Also, watch for the Nurse in the Subway scene - the most scariest sequence in the film.
  MANIAC is the film to have on DVD. The video and transfer were totally great. It was like watching a brand new print of a film. The Widescreen transfer (1.85:1), was also a nice added touch. The numerous theatre trailers, the 9 TV spots and the audio commentary (by William Lustig, Tom Savini & Co.) are those little extras that make MANIAC worth having on DVD !!!!!!  This is the DVD I bought back in 1999 from Elite Entertainment.
  I am excited about MANIAC being re-released through Anchor Bay Entertainment who will also be releasing this title in a LIMITED EDITION TIN, (5,000 copies only) which will contain a BONUS of the CD soundtrack of the music score by Jay Chattaway. on August 21, 2001.

I swear, from now on if I ever go to New York, you can count on me carrying a gun!  Unlike most films which dive into the horror genre with a young girl or guy as the man character and the killer as the sort of off-the-camera-star, ""Maniac"" actually switches these roles and does it with little story trouble at all.

Because, even after numerous viewings, it still makes my skin crawl and chills scamper up and down my spine.  In my book that makes it a truly great horror film.
Being a no budget movie it certainly has its fair share of flaws, uneven acting, scatter shot production values, and, because they shot the movie whenever they could instead of on a set production schedule, a story that skips and staggers and appears to go nowhere.  But there are several great set pieces during the running time and Joe Spinell expertly nails the complex behaviour of the title character.  The amount of research he put into creating a realistic serial killer and not just some masked buffon shows.

Perhaps the blame of ""Maniac""--a would-be intellectual slasher pic--doesn't fall entirely on his shoulders, because the script is awful, the characters are shallow, and the movie as a whole just LOOKS ugly.  Joe Spinell, who cowrote this junk, plays the title character, a chubby loser who goes about New York City killing pretty girls and scalping them for his mannequins at home.  All of this is supposedly based on the ""Son of Sam"" murders, but even something as nihilistic as ""Maniac"" demands a little plot to keep your interest, which isn't forthcoming.  In the end, all the excessive deep breathing, stupid ""insane"" monologues, and bloody murders can't make this movie anything more than the low-budget trash it is.

And I must say that Tom Savini did a bang-up (pun intended) job in the FX of his own grisly demise.
I would like to compliment it, but I just can't.  Insidious acting, awful directing and a plot line that's like having your foot nailed to the ground and running around in circles can't justify the gore.  A movie that's rife with gore that also incorporates similar bad acting (Lucio Fulci movies, for example) works because it doesn't take itself seriously.  That's why Fulci movies are generally successful: You finish the movie, say ""Boy, that was pretty disgusting!"" but you were entertained nonetheless.  Maniac attempts to create a somber mood and gain sympathy for the protagonist and it goes horribly astray.  It's not cheesy, gory fun.  It's just plain old cheesy.

It came out at a time when horror films were tumbling over each other to be the one with the most realistic gruesome effects, and Maniac boasts plenty of them.

The movie joins that small collection of slasher films (like ""Don't Answer The Phone"") in which the killer's identity is not a secret, but clear from the start. Joe Spinelli plays the disturbed man who kills and then scalps beautiful women so that he can take their hair home to decorate the shop mannequins that he keeps in his squalid apartment. Spinelli's performance is good, and manages not to make you hate him, which is quite a feat. But the mood of the film is just dirt, grime , sleaze and depression. It's also very black: night-time and darkness are everywhere. Nobody seems happy, everyone is living a miserable or hard life of some sort or another. The murder scenes are slick, and the effects brutal. The first close up scalping is amazing, but it's actually the least distressing scene, as the victim is already dead. Later, an extremely protracted chase through a subway ends with the victim still dead after all her efforts to escape, which I found really mean, as the suspense of ""will she or won't she?"" that has been generated throughout the 15 minute sequence is thrown out the window as the killer makes a sudden (and implausible) surprise appearance to snuff her out. The effect is jolting to be sure, but its an empty success as the victim is a passing woman who appears in the film for this scene alone, and at the end of it she's dead and never referred to again, so it shows the scene up as a mere exercise in generating tension that could have been in any context or an entire short film by itself. Later still, one of the most unpleasant scenes of all comes along when Joe Spinelli has a girl tied and gagged spread-eagled on a bed. He mounts her, knife at the ready, and bloodily fillets her while she slowly dies beneath him...I felt really disgusted at this scene. Did anyone find that fun to watch, really?

You may say I am missing the point. Maybe the film intends to sink the viewer into a dirty and depressing nightmare, to show the powerful horror that lurks around the underside of life. Well, it works - all the locations, like the subway, the maniac's apartment, etc are ugly and depressing, and Tom Savini does a good job of making the scalping and stabbing scenes look real, Plus the climactic bloodbath is particularly nightmarish. So yes, the sleazy and grim atmosphere is right for the films content, but it turns  out to be a showcase for all the worst aspects of the ""slasher"" genre"" if you ask me. Don't be surprised if you want to step outside and smell some fresh air when the film is over. If you find shop mannequins scary, watch ""Tourist Trap"" instead, and for gore, choose one of the many other early 80's  examples, a lot of which have a certain air of exuberance or zest about them.

Joe Spinell's performance is truly remarkable... must be seen to believe.  i think the greatest thing about the movie is that you're focused completly on Joe Spinell(our  maniac), it isn't the usual serial killer story about a cop trying to solve  a murder case kinda thing...  the story gets very deep into the world of  this very disturbed individual.  this film has scenes which you won't see  in no other films, not even in Henry: portrait of a serial killer...  a  highly recommended film for all fans of psychological thriller and ofcourse  gore fans(the film sfx were made by none other than tom savini). but  there's more to it than just gore.",953596800,12,692,4.675
801442,3,6304147074,"Maniac is one of the most notorious 80's slasher flicks, and deservedly so.  It's goy and quite repellant, and has a bit more plot than most entries in the genre.  That's not to say it isn't stupid at times-Spinell  overacts to the point of getting a nosebleed, and some of the effects look  fake.  But it is an interesting character study with an obviously severely  disturbed man, rather than an unfeeling monster, and the shotgun scene is  one of most shockingly realistic scenes in mainstream horror.  It's also  very eerie and claustrophobic, especially the ending, which kind of took me  aback.  Definately worth a look for slasher fans.",950486400,3,643,4.861111111111111
801443,1,6304147074,"Maniac, everything else aside, *is* disturbing, although in this case I think this counts as a negative against the film.
If there's ever an argument for violence as entertainment, this film would be the  incontestable proof for such an argument.  Maniac is basically a series of  bloody murders, violence against (mostly) women, and bloodshed without much  motivation.
There is no story; other than the faint, underdeveloped and  lopsided friendship between Frank Zito (Joe Spinell in a truly awful,  laughably melodramatic performance) and Caroline Munro (charming, but empty  as a character), the film simply presents a series of paratactic murders  with occasional nudity thrown in.  The Anna-Frank relationship is  completely ridiculous because Spinell opts to play Frank as nothing but a  maniac, without any shadings (unlike Anthony Perkins in Psycho, who's all  about shadings).  See the deleted scene (Anna and Frank talking in a  restaurant) from the Elite reissue to see how unconvincing this  relationship really is.  Spinell's script is atrocious, with self-conscious  and clumsy monologues interlaced with bits of character dialogue that  provide no dramatic satisfaction.  Frank for all his bulk is a complete  emotional and intellectual void, his screamings and ravings ringing hollow  because of the sheer ineptitude of the writing and the  performance.
William Lustig's cinematic technique isn't bad, though no  amount of kinetic directing can save this film.  Other redeeming features  -- an unusual woodwind-based score, Tom Savini's effects (except the first  throat-slitting, where you can obviously see the knife dragging across  flesh but no marks, poking through the ""blood-spurting razor""  trick that Savini often uses), and Kelly Piper playing the subway stalking  victim with gusto -- fare no better.  The narrative poverty at this film's  core leaves it unsalvageable.
This is the film that should be put forth  to demonstrate filmic sadism.  Not I Spit on Your Grave, which successfully  achieves a high degree of character authenticity and catharsis.  Maniac is  as cold-blooded as its titular character, and emblematizes the worst case  of mindless slasher film I have ever seen.",948240000,10,2211,5.5119760479041915
801444,3,6304147074,"Joe Spinell's performance is what makes this movie. His acting is excellent and brings great emotion to the sick character of Frank Zito. So much emotion that one cannot help but sometimes empathize with his raging  pain. This movie is well directed and is worth seeing for (though  predictable), the subway scene alone. Do not believe what you've read about  the gore effects. They are not impressive at all. The razor blade deaths  look incredibly fake. But Maniac is not the mysoginist slasher flick in  which it advertises itself. It is a well made character study about a  disturbed, suffering man.",938822400,3,603,4.920792079207921
7863632,4,6304147074,Classic underrated movie the actors genuinely creepy he was creepy and the godfather when he wasn't trying to be its very disturbing movie because the subject matter is taken seriously its not some guy in a hockey mask.

The Blue Underground Blu Ray has decent video quality, and the audio soundtrack sounds fantastic. Be sure to check out the Mr. Robbie: Maniac 2 promo extra on the Blu Ray. Too bad Spinell died before they got a chance to make it a full feature.",1503446400,3,414,4.376623376623376
