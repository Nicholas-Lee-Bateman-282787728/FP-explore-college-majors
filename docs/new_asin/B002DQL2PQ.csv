8365765,5,B002DQL2PQ,"I greatly enjoyed this TLC series. There is no better learning than a real life experience. This is an especially great preparation source for a first time mother-to-be: 45-episodes cover pretty much all possible complications of childbirth and provide a clear picture of what to expect. Further, I find it vital that parents-to-be shared their personal thoughts, fears and concerns prior to and after the childbirth. The only discrepancy I found is that not all episodes can be found in the sequence they are printed on each disc and some of the episodes can be located on another disc of this season, yet all 45-episodes are included in this boxed set. Also, this series can be very beneficial to a medical student, researcher or anyone who is interested in the miracle of childbirth. Great value!",1245196800,2,799,4.925925925925926
