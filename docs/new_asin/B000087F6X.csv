1828092,5,B000087F6X,"I've read the comic series (well, up to #5 anyway) and I must say that the animation makes the story even more interesting -- compared to other japanese animation Chobits has more depth to it (within its category). Can't wait to finish the comic series--",1046736000,3,254,4.666666666666667
1828093,5,B000087F6X,"This is a very funny and enjoyable series.  Chi is probably the most kawaii non-child character I've seen in 20+ years of watching anime.  If I had to rank the ""maid"" series that have been released in the U.S. it would be: 1 - Chobits, 2 - Mahoromatic, 3 - Kurumi, 4 - Handmaid May.
The Official Amazon reviewer labels it as sexist and, superficially, it is.  However, the only really passive female in the story are the Persocoms (e.g. Person(al) Computers) who are programmed that way.  The human females are not particularly passive for anime.  The only real idiot is the guy, Hideki.  Considering that Chi starts out intellectually/emotionally as essentially an amnesiac child with a one-word vocabulary (""Chi"") - no wonder she's rather passive - she makes significant strides throughout the series.  In fact, this is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the story as we watch her develop social skills and her own needs and desires.  The first few episodes serve as a sort of primer on Japanese, as Hideki teaches Chi greetings, names of common objects, and such.
There is some ecchi content (I would rate this somewhere between PG-13 and R - there's more naughtiness than outright sexuality) but I otherwise highly recommend this series.",1046390400,16,1243,4.85781990521327
1828094,4,B000087F6X,"My first CLAMP (collective group made by all-female writers) series was ""Angelic Layer"".  While it was fun, but it did not have enough depth to make me think over.  So I find myself pleasantly surprise about this one.
In order to stop myself from spoiling over, this starts as a story of a boy with good heart, but gets overboard easily which translates into sort of matchmaker while himself is single.  One day he discovers a persocon (android, that is), and the story begins.
While starting seems bit cheesy, it progresses into something more serious about human relationship itself.  Watching Hideki (the main character) interacting and teaching Chii (one in cover) demonstrates the blue print for the perfect relationship.  It blends that ""Love at first sight"" with ""becoming more comfortable as you get older"" in such way that you can't help yourself but to watch more and more.
Of course, if the show is all about human relationship, it would be too dry and gooey.  It throws plenty of mishaps involving the characters to make you laugh (especially with Hideki's hobit :)).
It is neither as simple as Cardcapter, nor too serious as X, but I find it hitting right balance in between.  For those who find too much of same in ""Love Hina"" or ""Ai Yori Aoshi"", this will be surprising change, for good.",1046304000,9,1302,4.76
1828095,5,B000087F6X,"You may be wondering why there are so many editions to volume 1 of Chobits on DVD, that is because Pioneer is excellent when it comes to putting out anime!  To attract more fans to purchase all of a specific volume of the series (in this case Chobits), they have made a box to hold all future DVD releases.  The well-decorated box of Chobits is wonderful and will definitely be easy for you to find this anime series!  In addition to the box, Pioneer has included an exclusive stationary set of this series!  What a great incentive to start out this hilarious anime by CLAMP ^_^.  You can use the stationary set to jot-down some notes about this awesome anime!

** Description **
A Boy's first computer. A country boy from Hokkaido, Hideki arrives in the big city (Tokyo) to go to college. Instantly, he is shocked and amazed by the variety and prevalence of Persocoms: personal computers designed to look and act like animals or even people! Too poor to afford one of his own, Hideki is overjoyed to discover a discarded Persocom in a trash heap. However, this gift of fate turns into a mystery as his Persocom, Chi, appears to be able to operate without her OS... How real is real?
The Chobits DVD contains four bilingual episodes (English & Japanese) on a DVD9 with two English subtitle streams (Dialogue translation & Signs Only translation), non-credit opening animation and other extras.",1046217600,,1620,4.7304964539007095
1828096,5,B000087F6X,"You may think this is just another romantic comedy, which we seem to have been swamped with recently, but this series has enough differences to make it a unique buy.
Set in the near future, advanced computers have been developed, that look and act like human beings, called persacons. Not too advanced, however, as they require you to install software before they can carry out certain tasks, and people treat them as accessories. However this is a good thing considering the general story, it works well. The story follows Hideki Motosuwa, a young man who has lived on a farm all his life. He decides to go to university in Tokyo but fails the entrance exam (thats where the love Hina contrast ends thankfully) so is forced to move to Tokyo to go to a prep school.
Hideki finds himself at a loss, however, as he can not get to grips with city life and the advancement of technology (which leads to him embarresing himself several times, which is quite funny). After settleing in Hideki finds a Persacon in the trash near his apartment, wich was lucky. The Persacon turns out to be Chii, a mysterious persacon which seems to running without software. They then throw in a few other love interests, as this sort of story always seems to, thats not really a bad thing though.
 A refreshingly new take on the good old romantic comedy, with funny and interesting characters and situations. And it also has a mysterious and dark underlying story revolving around Chii's past, to stop it getting too cute (This is Clamp, has to get dark somewhere doesn't it).
 The music is fitting, and quite well done. However it can be terrifyingly cute at points, and I don't mean just the music the entire series can be like this in points. I like it myself, but some people don't like cute, so this is a heads up.
 I'm afraid I can not comment on the English voice acting, as I own the Japanese DVD, but the Japense audio is very good, if you don't mind subtitles.
 I feel I must warn you that this series may not be for a younger audience. While it does not contain any terrible bad language or graphic scenes of violence or nudity, it has a very implied adult theme, with a lot of (tastful) sexual jokes.
 All in all an excellent series, another success by clamp.",1046044800,8,2248,4.513513513513513
1828105,5,B000087F6X,"The series Chobits kicks off in its first episodes on dvd vol 1. Hideki, a country boy who failed his college entrance exams begins his independant living adventure as he moves away from home on the farm and into a city apartment. Surprise lurks at every corner as the poor boy, a virgin in many ways, learns more and more about what it means to be a true student.

The premise of the story begins when Hideki learns that everyone he comes to know, and the people in urban Japan have Persocons, otherwise known as personal-computers. They manifest in several forms according to the maker; kawaii (cute) girls or young women, young children, handsome men and even miniature people, the smallest feigning as keychain toys. Alas, as a simpleton ronin from the countryside, he is already struggling to make ends meet, when his luck takes a surprising turn when he finds a mysterious Persocon. While there is much more to it than that, I'm not willing to spoil the story in this review, only offer a summary of the plot and some opinions.

Chobits is one of the most original stories I have encountered and remains a favorite in my heart among all anime. From the adorable character design to the offbeat humor, Chobits really can't be beat. I would suggest parents of younger children be aware that there are some adult scenes in this series, while it never ventures into showing all that much skin. Ecchi has come to be known as a descriptor for many animes aimed towards teenage and adult boys. Meaning ""sexual in nature"", it has a place in the deeper crevices in some of the episodes; references to ero-sites (erotic sites), model magazines (Japanese equivalent of playboy, minus the articles) and peep shows. None of the more adult scenes are to be taken seriously, however, and are in a large part, the subject of humor in the series. Keep this in mind though, if you are more reserved than most people.

All in all, if you are looking for something that will touch your heart, and some cheap laughs, this is just the anime for you. With laugh out loud humor and a romance based story, anime lovers of all kinds have come to love the series, big fans naming the main female lead as the #1 bishoujou (cute, young girl) in a national survey in America.",1111104000,5,2251,4.5945273631840795
1828106,5,B000087F6X,"I like how this one starts.  A farmhand who wants to go to an exclusive college (probably would be a university in the US) gets rejected from his school of choice but decides to go to a prep school in Tokyo (in USA it's a junior college).  Wandering the Tokyo streets, he finds a PC in the trash, brings it to his apartment and activates it-- which immediately prompts him to fall in love with it. (Did I mention that all of the PCs, or Persocoms in this series look like teenage girls?)

The pace is slow and easy to follow; the tone is sometimes subtle and frequently frantic-- in the vein of '80s American sitcoms like Three's Company or Bosom Buddies. There is cuteness, but not to the level that would induce diabetes.  There is sexual reference and very brief nudity, but not too extreme.

What makes me recommend Chobits?  Clean graphics, simple but engaging stories, and very good voice acting (even by the American cast, which, sadly, is a rarity in anime).

The cultural differences aren't too jarring, and are well explained in the plot (for instance, the concept of older ""senpai"" students interacting with younger ones).

Strangely, the character who should be the most grating is still very charming.  Sumomo is a smaller ""mobile persocom""-- a ""palmtop"" Persocom, who assists Hideki and Chi throughout the story.

Highly recommended.",1099785600,4,1347,4.792207792207792
1828107,5,B000087F6X,All I can say is do not start unless you plan to finish. This is funny cute and based on an adult sense of humor so why is it so addictive.,1098316800,2,139,3.5161290322580645
1828108,4,B000087F6X,"Story: A kind young farmer/student failed his college exams, and must go to the city to study and prepare for his next attempt. He sees androids that are near-perfect matches of humans, but can't afford one. He goes home dreaming of owning one, and passes a shut-down persocom, one of the cute androids. He takes it home and activates it, and gains an obedient and loving machine. He meets a sad and beautiful teacher, a cute co-worker, a quiet and pretty apartment owner. He slowly uncovers the story behind each of these three people and a few others, and learns more about what's important in life.

About the show:
The show, in the beginning, revolves mostly about teaching Chii, the persocom, how to do a daily task, such as cooking, shopping for underwear, or getting a job. At some points the show is a little slow and you might get bored, but it can be funny, dramatic, or cute. If you don't like the cutesy stuff, you might want to look for another show. Chii often acts adorable, complete with making puppy-dog eyes. Sometimes this show portrays the covers of porn mags and some sounds, but no actual nudity. Still, it would probably be uncomfortable watching it with your parents. Later on, you will see some problems caused by persocoms falling in love, and that is the main theme of the show. Can a person and an android fall in love? Should they? You'll find out. The art is beautiful and colorful, and the music is pleasant. I think the voices in both the sub and the dub are good. I recommend this anime.",1098057600,6,1520,4.547445255474453
1828109,4,B000087F6X,"Chobits, Volume One contains the first three episodes of the anime series by Clamp. Clamp is the female artist studio that created the popular Sakura Cardcaptors manga and anime.  Chobits has such a bouncy, catchy, intro that makes it seems like the series will be as innocent as Cardcaptors.  In a way, Chobits is innocent, but it also has some very sexual aspects.  In the first few minutes, the main character Hideki is ranting about how he wants a Persocom to download porn from the Internet.  His porn mags are open, showing hot shots of young girls.  Later on the disc, Hideki visits a young computer prodigy who has a bevy of beautiful Persocoms in highly sexual maid outfits.  This incongruous blend of shoujo and ecchi still is very sweet and moral as a whole.

Chobits begins as young Hideki leaves the countryside for the big city of Tokyo as he has to attend prep school because he has failed the entrance examination to college.  This Tokyo is modern day Japan; the slow Japanese economy is mentioned.  But Tokyoites have humanoid robots that they use as PC's.  There are full size ones, and mini ones.  They are almost all female, without exception, and are used sometimes as sex objects - in fact, they have ALL their parts in place.  This subverted sexism can make some female viewers uneasy.  Yet the kawaii quotient is super-high, so it somewhat cancels out the perveted stuff.

Hideki is a typical poor college student who cannot afford a Persocom in his dreams.  He mysteriously finds a lovely Persocom tosed out in the trash.  His friend has a (super cute) mini Persocom and helps Hideki get Chi started.  Chi is extremely pretty and naiive. Her new owner is highly aroused.  He is a gentleman with her, though.  Hideki runs into problems with her setup, and the mystery deepens.  Where did Chi come from?  She seems to be custom-made, but by who?  The mystery will deepen in volume two.",1094169600,10,1908,4.683734939759036
1828110,5,B000087F6X,"When i first saw Chobits I was drawn in by the characters and the wit of this show.  Though the show has stuff in it like the books of ""goodies"" I didn't mind having my little brother watch it with me.  He didn't understand some of the more adult themes but he enjoyed it either way.  Chii is very cute and i wish Clamp would have made more episodes of Chobits.",1093824000,2,361,4.056338028169014
1828111,5,B000087F6X,"I'm a new watcher and have only seen a few episodes, but I'm hopelessy addicted now. The plot is original, the characters are absolutely loveable (especially Chi and Sumomo!), and the art is amazing. I highly reccommend this to anyone.",1086912000,4,235,4.9
1828112,5,B000087F6X,"For everyone that thinks this is in the future, it's not. It's an alternate universe, meaning that it's the same time period as us, just on another world. They live the same way almost, just are a lot more... not to say smarter but... a lot more progressed then us. They are still humans, they are still in our time, or whenever the series was made, they are not in the future. Just an alternate universe; almost an alternate Earth that is a lot more progressed.
This has to be one of the least sexist things out there. You want sexist? Watch FLCL (also known as Fooly Cooly). On FLCL, they have (...) mags that they just cut out the privates with black boxes. They also have a 12-15 year old girl screwing a 40 year old in the first episode, I think. And this was aired on Cartoon Network, which wouldn't even let Cowboy Bebop air (...) where two gay guys were kissing on a bed with their shirts off, and a sheet over them. Now, you may ask how that has anything to do with Chobits, and it has nothing to do with them! But I just wanted to show you irony.
Now, Hideki may be perverted, but does he ever get Chii to have sex with him? No. Does he ever make her serve him, make her worship him? No. Chii is very reserved and kind and submissive because she knows no other ways. She can not remember her past, or how to act. So she doesn't lash out or anything. Also, Hideki is very kind to her and treats her like a person. They find love, which is probably the purest of all between anyone, since it's between a percecome (can't spell) and a human. You may think a robot/computer and human can't go together, but they go against all odds and do. It's one of the greatest things in anime.
This has to be the BEST anime for showing true love, not just 'aww I love you' and a week later, they're divorced. Chii and Hideki have a very strong, true love that most people don't even know of being possible.",1082160000,14,1900,4.193989071038251

Chobits tries to be a lot of things at once... a love story, a drama, a fanservice comedy. What is amazing it that it manages to stay so interesting. About the only negative thing I can say here is that Chobits deals frequently with sexual subject matter. But if you have access to cable TV then you and your kids have already seen enough to make this lightweight as far as adult subject matter.

I give up. I admit it. I like Chobits. A lot. I want Chobits merchandise, and I want more Chobits DVDs to come out. Syrup never tasted sooo gooood.",1065571200,21,694,4.225563909774436
1828119,4,B000087F6X,"This first DVD covers much of the first manga, with extra details, like what Hideki did BEFORE the events in the manga (he worked on a farm).  It shows him moving into the city, meeting Hiromu with Sumomo(Plum), his landlady - Ms Hibiya, finding Chi  in the trash and, of course, going to Minoru for help.  There are a few DVD extras, such as the art gallery and Non-Credit Opening, but with only four episodes available on the DVD, I am slightly disappointed.
It's funny as Hell, they gave Sumomo lots of screen time (which is great because I love Plum) and the episode about underwear had me laughing so hard it felt like my heart stopped, but many anime series are coming out with at least five or six episodes on the first DVD THEN decreasing it to four or three episodes on the rest that follow.  With only four episodes and TWO extras, there is not a lot being offered.  It was GOOD, but they could of easily burned more onto the DVD.
Many anime series, like Love Hina or Please Teacher! have also kept the number of episodes per DVD down to four or three, but they make it up with lots of extras.

1828120,5,B000087F6X,"This is my favorite anime series. It's very cute, the characters are surprisingly believable and often funny, and the plotlines are often creative.
Chi, a lifesize robot who looks like a young girl, is found by Hideki, an 18 year old guy who didn't get into college so has to go to cram school. Chi's different from all the other robots, or persocoms, she's very naive and mysterious. She's capable of learning and is much like a young child exploring her surroundings. Her childlike learning process is very believable, and you won't be able to help but fall in love with her.
Hideki reflects Chi's naivety nicely, as he's from the country and new to the hustle and bustle of city life. The similarities and contrasts between the two are very well done. They're an unlikely but awesome duo.
The show just gets rounded out with more and more well done characters, such as the easily scared Sumomo, who's about 8 inches tall.
Really, it's a very cute show, and lots of fun to watch. My only complaint is it does occassionally get sexual for ratings sake. It's never beyond PG-13 stuff (and is rated 16+ by Pioneer), but it's usually not necessary. Oh well, it's still a great show, I can't recommend it enough.",1062633600,15,1209,4.627906976744186

The anime series, as opposed to the manga, is a bit more detailed.  (As in you get to see where Hideki comes from.)  But, like most anime series, the stories are almost exactly the same as the mangas.  Still, it is great for anybody who liked the manga to watch the characters animated.  For anybody who has never read the books, this series is still great.

1828123,4,B000087F6X,"Chobits will at once, remind Anime fans of Hand Made May, Love Hina, and Video Girl Ai. It is similar to these, plus other series involving a clueless ronin, and his collection of lady friends. Fortunately, the similarities end very quickly after about the first third of the series.  A mystery develops, and characters begin to take on some real dimensions.
This series is does not just focus on Chi, the android, found in the trash by Hideki.  It focuses on the many relationships people might have, when presented with such lifelike ""helpers"". Many of the motivations behind how characters act in this series, are not revealed until near the end of the series.  Some of them take you totally by surprise.
Like most of the series in this genre, one of the main goals is humor, and it succeeds admirably there.  Chi has a knack for getting into some funny situations.  The writers do a good job of showing how Chi reacts to the world.  They seem to have a good handle on how an android, with a lack of real-world data, might act in their environment.  This gives the character, a more believable role in the way she (""it?"") reacts in the Anime.
Clamp as a group, likes to do a lot of ""conspiracy theory"" stuff.  This series is no exception to that rule.  Fortunately, that is not the whole focus of the series. This is good, the series true focus, is on the growing relationship between Hideki and Chi.  How it plays out in this series, is somewhat different that most of us might expect.",1059264000,,1489,4.522388059701493
1828124,4,B000087F6X,"After completing the Chobits Series I was left with mixed feelings. The whole
story is basically about a nave, yet nice boy named Hideki who leaves behind his country life and goes to the city to enroll in a prep school. He happens upon a persocom/Chobits (human-like robots) and his life is forever changed.
Watching Hideki experience city life and prep school was interesting and humorous. He comes off very silly and over dramatic. However his discovery of persocoms (human-like robots) and their service to humans made me cringe. Mainly because at first all you see is female persocoms (male persocoms are seen later). It was hard to believe men would only use ""hot"" persocoms for internet, errands, and other domestic duties.

I agree with Mr. Solomon's review that this does feed into an outdated outlook that a women's purpose in life is to please a man. It was quite a relief that Mr. Hideki showed some honor by making Chii's happiness a priority. However, there was too much emphasis on Chii wanting to please Hideki and earn her owners affection. Frankly it sort of annoyed me to see a human-like robot having not much of a life. I know that robots' now being created in Japan are to help people, but is it really necessary to feed into a man's desire to have a female (human or robot) living to please only him? This series was almost a carbon copy of ""Ai Yori Aoshi"", except the female character is a robot in this series. Anyone ever heard of Feminism?
Despite the culture shock I experienced while watching the series, there were some good things about the series. The art is just amazing. The nice numbers of characters are likable and well drawn. The plot is interesting enough to complete the series. The little mobile persocoms are just adorable that I wanted one for myself. I appreciated the issues brought up about robot and human romantic relationships. The conclusion to the issue was rather satisfying and easy to accept, since you feel so sorry for Chii's after awhile. The music was not too cheesy but rather impressive, such as ""Ningyo Hime"" and ""Raison Detre"".
I gave the series four stars because it was still interesting and humorous. I found myself really caring about the characters and their situations. Also it had a happy ending, which is hard to come by with some anime.",1058745600,6,2307,4.7245657568238215

If you can keep an open mind and focus on the other main themes explored in this series, then you'll find that most of your time will be spent either watching ""Chobits"" or waiting for the next volume to come out.
Hideki Motosuwa, 18, has worked on a farm all his life, and is shattered to find out that he was rejected from the college of his choice. He decides to go to the big city and enroll in a Yobikou or Cram School (similar to Kaplan Prep or Princeton Review programs) to get into school. The first thing that catches his eye is the popular Persocon phenomenon--nearly everyone he sees when he first steps into the city has one form or another of human-looking robot companions (the jutting ear/headpieces being the only way to identify them). Sadly for farm-boy Hideki, they cost an exorbitant amount of money. Still, nearly everyone has one (they're equivalent to the popularity of cell phones for us), and he continues to want one.
Leave it to wishful thinking to have Hideki find a near-naked Persocon lying in the trash by his apartment complex. He takes her home and (here comes the PG-13/Feminist Beware part) activates it by pressing in what is quite a special spot. She comes to life but with one flaw: she can only say the word ""Chi.""
Through the various friends he makes in this first disc--landlady Hibya, neighbor and classmate Shinbo (and his adorable mini-mobile Persocon Sumomo), as well as Persocon expert/child genius Minoru (and his own Persocon Yuzuki)--Hideki finds that his Persocon (soon to be named ""Chi"") is running without an operating system or learning software, with processing speeds of nearly infinite capacity. Shinbo and Minoru theorize on what Chi could be: a Chobits, a legendary series of Persocons that, above all their unique abilities, can exercise free will.
The series continues as such; Hideki juggling school, a part-time job, teaching Chi words and manners, while everyone attempts to find out 1) if Chi is indeed a Chobits, 2) who made her, 3) what her full capabilities are. Several subplots include a mysterious e-mailer sending photos and clues of what appears to be Chi; a series of fairy tale books that hooks Chi, and seem oddly to relate to Hideki and her situation. Thematically, ""Chobits"" puts forth reasonably deep questions regarding identity: what is it to be human? What is it to be a Persocon? And can love cross those boundaries? There is a mid-sized pool of characters in ""Chobits,"" each with their own experiences regarding love and Persocons, as well as two powerful, independent-minded Persocons named Dita and Jima, the former seemingly bent on finding and stopping Chi.
The art is great; Japanese animators have become so extremely skilled as to seamlessly integrate computer graphics and effects into the drawings, as well as easily use various lighting and multi-layering techniques. ""Chobits"" features a very active camera that constantly changes angles, zooms in and out, and appropriately get blurry or sharp. The soundtrack includes one of the catchiest opening and ending themes; not since ""Cowboy Bebop"" has the ""adventurous/comedic"" music been so appropriately used, and not since ""Rurouni Kenshin"" has a melancholy piano instrumental been used so perfectly to evoke sadness. The Japanese vocals for Chi and Sumomo better match their images than the English dubs, the only significant vocal difference.
The PG-13 issue...There is no flat out nudity or even excessive swearing or violence, but ""Chobits"" certainly doesn't lack for adult topics. Kidnapping, adultery, pornography and inappropriate touches are all covered in ""Chobits."" Thankfully, the computer jargon isn't overwhelming; computer illiterates won't falter since the main character (Hideki) is himself quite a naive dolt when it comes to those things.
The feminist issue...This is a series that more likely than not would cause a walkout if it were played on Oprah or The View. Persocons are almost exclusively female in ""Chobits,"" and not once in the 26-episode series, other than Jimma (who appears in the last 1/4 of the series), is a male Persocon brought in as a major character, although you can oftentimes glimpse male persocons in the background. Chi is *extremely* submissive--everything she does is ""to make Hideki happy."" Minoru's Victoria's Secret-clad maids and Sumomo's genie outfit will certainly raise eyebrows as well. But to counter, several female characters do play key, empowered parts: Shimizu the teacher, fierce Persocon Dita, as well as the flipside to landlady Hibya's identity. On a more open-minded level, ""Chobits"" is more concerned with the ideas of love and devotion for those you care for. For each of Chi's submissive actions is a life-risking display by Hideki as well.
No giant robots, no major sword and kung fu fights; still, ""Chobits"" is highly watchable for its unique atmosphere, a mystery unfolded at just the right pace, and the eye-candy art. You can forward through three ""recap""-type episodes: one in the middle, the second to last one, and parts of the last episode, all of which merely play montages of what had happened in the series. Highly recommended for most all anime fans.",1058659200,20,5310,5.069714285714285

It all starts out when Hideki goes off to prep school in Tokyo and finds a persocom, (personal computer) lying in the trash, and she's a cute persocom too.  Persocoms are computers that look, feel, and act exactly like real people.  However, Hideki's persocom is different, the only thing she can say is ""Chi"", and he finds out that she's a custum-made persocom, and nobody seems to know anything about her.  Well, he has to teach Chi, get through his classes, get a job, and find Chi some clothes!!  And all the while, he falls in love with every girl he meets-including his apartment manager, and tends to talk out loud, which is so funny because he always embarasses himself.

Hideki is a modern day ""ronin,"" a highschool graduate who failed to pass the notoriously difficult Japanese university entrance exams so must go to a special cram school in order to take the test again. Since the tests are only offered once a year, Hideki has ample time to study. But he's sidetracked once he finds a beautiful ""Persocon"" android wiht a mysterious and complex past.
The anime series goes on for 26 episodes and sometimes you wonder where the series is headed while star Hideki's ""Aww shucks"" ignorant bumpkin personality can wear a little thin at times over the nearly 13 hours the complete series runs.

1828129,3,B000087F6X,"I love this manga series, I have every volume that has been released domestically, and I am even reading fansubs online.  That being said, the anim&eacute; leaves a lot to be desired.
First of all they have censored the series!  This is the same kind of Cartoon Network garbage that has been pulled on Tenchi Muyo, Ranma 1/2, even Sailor Moon!  There are important storyline reasons for leaving the story as it was written.  Censoring out nudity (and the original amount of nudity in this series was practically nill in the first place), violence, language, etc. hurts the story and takes away from the realism.  I have said it before, and I will say it again, ""anim&eacute;"" is *not* synonymous with ""cartoon.""  Leave the series as it was originally written, they wrote it that way for a reason!  It seems the major reason American companies are pulling this garbage is because anim&eacute; is animated, and therefore it must be a ""cartoon,"" so therefore it must be intended for children right?  Wrong!  There are very few Japanese anim&eacute; series that are intentionally aimed at child audiences (at least American children, Japanese children are exposed to much more, much sooner).
That being said (okay, ranted) I *will* say that except for the censorship -- the series is pretty faithful to the manga.  The character voices are pretty much what I was imagining when I read the manga.  One small point that annoys me is they have changed Plum's name to the Japanese ""Sumomo.""  Sumomo means plum in Japanese, but it just isn't as cute as plum.  What is interesting is that they use the Japanese name Sumomo in both the English dub and the Japanese voice version with English sub-titles.
The animation is clean and clear, very smooth and soft -- as the manga was originally drawn.  They do engage in an annoying cut-scene with cheesy graphics whenever Hideki is thinking hard about something, or is embarrassed or fantasizing, but other than that the animation is eye pleasing.
Bottom line, the main basic storyline is still intact -- just censored.  The voice acting is acceptable (in both English and Japanese versions).  The animation is clean and bright and eye pleasing.  I enjoy most anything from Clamp, and this series is no exception, but I doubt I will buy the rest of the DVDs in this series, I will stick with the manga until they stop censoring it.",1056067200,3,2366,4.802469135802469

Sure, it's full of comedy and funny moments...but some of the episodes I felt were pointless and just there as fillers.  Too much focus was put on Chii's adventures and what she learned instead of actually explaining who she was, and where she came from.  Most of the important information was crammed into the last few episodes.  It was fun watching the first time, but I wouldn't recommend giving it a second go.  I still think you should give the dvds a try, but I've heard that the manga (graphic novels) is much better.",1054080000,3,627,4.522123893805309

The story actually explores the deeper meaning of relationships. But you can also just enjoy the comical interplay of the characters.

Rie Tanaka, the Japanese voice actress for Chii, does the bulk of the singing heard in Chobits, including all three Chobits ending theme songs - 1) ""Raison d'etre,"" 2) ""Ningyo Hime"" (""Mermaid Princess"") and 3) ""Katakoto no Koi,"" duet version with Tomokazu Sugita, Japanese voice actor for Hideki Motosuwa; 4) insert song version of ""Let Me Be With You"" (Chii version), performed by ROUND TABLE featuring Chii; 5) insert song, ""Katakoto no Koi"" (""Awkward Love""), Chii version; 6) final insert song, ""I hear you everywhere""; and several other Chobits songs. In all, counting different versions of the same song, Rie Tanaka, Chii's Japanese voice actress, sings six or seven songs heard in the Chobits anime. Keitarou Takanami, a former member of the internationally acclaimed Japanese band Pizzicato Five, is responsible for the Chobits soundtrack. This information can be gleaned from, among other things, the original Japanese opening and ending credits for Chobits, various Japanese Chobits music CDs, and a number of Japanese music CDs by Rie Tanaka.",1050710400,6,1370,5.260273972602739
1828135,5,B000087F6X,"I don't own the DVD, but I've seen ALL Chobits episodes and its one of the best out there. Very simple, humorous and touching. I'd say you go for it!",1050624000,2,149,4.0
1828136,4,B000087F6X,"I took a chance on this series by CLAMP (the group that brought you Cardcaptor Sakura, Magic Knight Rayearth, and X, just to name just a few) but don't expect to find the playful, innocent nature that you find in Cardcaptor Sakura because it is more adult themed, thus earning a 16+ ranking from Pioneer.
A little background on the story from what you just know from the first volume.  In a more advanced present day, Hideki Motosuwa (the main male character) decides to move to Tokyo from the countryside to study to get into college as he was rejected this year.  He is amazed by the vast technology that surrounds him as Persocoms (short for personal computer or ""person on computer"") are roaming the streets with the public.  These persocoms are not the desktops that you have in your houses; these are all in the form of people, toys, or animals.  Just to his luck, he finds Chi lying in the trash.  Now, all this happens with not-so-subtle adult jokes.  I was a little turned off by this but the fact that there was no direct nudity or need to accentuate anything like that put me more at ease.  So the real thing that was perverted in a sense is the jokes or gestures, which both I can handle and put aside to enjoy the show.  If you are a little skeptical, then try to watch a few episodes beforehand to see if you would want to buy it instead.
Next, the packaging is simply breathtaking.  Oddly enough, Pioneer packed in a limited supply of a Chobits stationary set.  It looks like a cosmetic case (in pink and white) but within has a letter opener, pencil, eraser, and scissors.  As many companies are now releasing box sets with their releases, it seems to have lost its value as they are plainer than others but this one is easily an exception.  The top is very simple (which I think it should be) with just a picture of Sumomo (Hideki's friend's Persocom).  On the back of the box is a very nice picture of Hideki and Chi outside a window on a sunny day.  It's very refreshing.  One side of the box shows a very beautiful picture of Chi in a pink dress with red ribbons watching the cherry blossoms blow away from her hand.  On the other side, there are three darker characters surrounding Chi, in pink, in the center.  This really works well as it accents Chi as the pink is brighter than the surrounding black of the other characters.  One of the darker characters looks like a darker Chi while the other two haven't been revealed yet.  This makes me eager to watch more as it seems the light-hearted nature that was seen in the first volume will change to a darker, deeper, tone.  On the packaging of the DVD, Pioneer decided to use a hand-drawn manga (Japanese comic) picture of Chi sitting and smiling atop a telephone pole.  While I am sometimes iffy about using manga art for DVD volumes, as they are separate things in ways, this works out really well.  The colors are vibrant, yet also subtle.  It creates a very refreshing scene.  The back does well with listing the volume number and episode titles.  Being a dork, I notice the fonts and that its variety is nice and style works well with the technological theme of the show.
Another thing that this release amazed me with was the amazing quality of the animation on DVD.  Lines were so crisp and clear and the backgrounds were subtle and did very well with supporting the characters in the scenes.  The sound quality is also very nice.
Final Note: I am still worried about the fact that companies are cutting down on episodes per DVD on more popular titles.  This release is going to span seven volumes, when it could just as easily fit six.  With the variety of releases nowadays, it is harder to buy all that you want to so it would be easier if the companies helped out in that aspect.  But on another note, I'm happy with the packaging.  I hope for the same quality from other companies and for Pioneer to step up another notch and wow me again.  I look forward to this release to unfold the mystery of Chi and ""Chobits.""",1049068800,12,4000,4.429548563611491

1828142,5,B000087F6X,"I'm sure you have already read about this series, so this review presents an alternative view. This series is about unconditionally Loving someone, not male dominance, female submissiveness, or even cute anime girls/robots.
 Motosuwa Hideki (the lead male character) is a young man (slightly, ok hugely, perverted) but has a good heart, works hard to do well in life and just wants to find someone he can Love.
 Chii (the lead female character) is a persicom without any accessible memories. She also has a drive to learn, be a good person and find ""the only one for her.""
 In this story, we see perhaps the purest Love there can be. A story where both parties truly Love EACH OTHER! This is the real kind of Love that takes work and commitment, not the kind that is effortless and fades. The kind of Love where you forget about your concerns, your pleasures, your comforts, even you and sacrifice everything so that your partner can be an inkling happier. The kind of Love that only works if both members are willing to surrender themselves to each other, trusting that the other really does Love them and is looking out for your happiness.
 This isn't a sexist story for the simple fact that Hideki is as submissive to Chii as she is to him. As for all the persicoms being female, watch closely. There are some male persicoms as well, but the artists tend to draw ""perfect"" looking men very effeminately. There are no main character male persicoms, but would the series be any better if there had? (Ok, I could think of a few interesting plot twists, but let's keep it simple.)
 This series has everything. True Love, angst, action, tension, deception, depth, humor, etc. It does have some tastefully presented adult oriented material, but it is a story that I would let my children watch. Perhaps they could learn that kind of Love. Perhaps they can learn from the dangers Chii faces. Perhaps they can learn that adult things are special and meant for only their special someone.

1828143,5,B000087F6X,"If you love a robot, can it truly love you back?  What if it is of the highly advanced ""Chobit"" series?  As CLAMP's most recent story to hit the TV screen April 2nd last year in Japan, Chobits is a fun and enjoyable show with plenty of comedy and a good dose of romance and drama.  Despite the seemingly plotless nature, there's actually a shady back story revealed little by little that ultimately ends up explaining the cute and innocent robotic mystery that is Chii (or ""Chi"" if you prefer the Americanized spelling).
While I'll generally agree that CLAMP's comic version of the story (manga) was a bit on the mature, fanservicey side, the anime is toned-down in comparison.  You'll see much worse in PG-13 rated movies than you will ever see in Chobits.  The only extremely questionable scene that I can recall that might be a concern to parents in a later episode is a vivid dream sequence in which Hideki dreams his co-worker and secret admirer, Yumi, places his hand in her shirt and requests some sexual favors. That, and the fact that Hideki is an avid porno-fan.  There are hardly any language issues and the nudity is brief never full nor explicit due to cloth and hair in the way.  I would definitely not rate this anime anything higher than PG-13.
Animation : 10/10 - While turning Chii blonde may be a disappointment to some, the animation is smooth and consistent.
Music : 9/10 - The opening theme ""Let Me Be With You"" is upbeat and catchy, though it might get on your nerves after a while.  The BGM for the series fits the mood perfectly. The creepy music works well, the dramatic music engages you in the moment, and the normal music with an odd sort of shoo-bee-doo-aah theme is a nice break from your standard anime music.
Voice Work : 10/10 - Hideki's voice is so believable as are the rest of the voices! Outstanding voice acting by the renowned Kikuko Inoue who voices Hideki's landlady Hibiya Chitose!

7979445,5,B000087F6X,"I am a huge fan of Anime, as well as a fan of the artist team Clamp. Upon first entering the world of Chobits, I was a little reluctant to delve too deep, the sugary sweet overtones were more than I thought I would be able to handle. But taking into consideration that I am a huge fan of Cardcaptor Sakura, and X. I decided to give it a go.

  It was wonderful and intoxicating, I became hooked right from the first frame. Having been raised on a farm for the first thirteen year of my life(like the main character) I found it overly funny to watch our hero manage to humiliate himself time and again over the smallest things.

  I became hooked on the humor, and the ever so subtle way the undercurrents of the show begin to come to surface.

  For those of you who are wondering if you should take a chance and buy this; then take the time, make up your mind, and buy the DVD, you will become addicted, and will want the rest of them.

  I love the fact that this DVD features Anamorphic Widescreen, both English and, Japanese Language. as well as subtitles. I am very glad I didn't let the cover scare me off, it is one of the most satisfying shows I have watched in a long, long time.",1114041600,5,1188,4.162280701754386
