8653838,4,B00JU28SXU,"A really good, well-acted movie. I just am not content with one thing: the ending. I don't want to play down somebody's fears, not at all, but I do know people like Kate who use their fears as a weapon, who do not even try and cope with them and brace themselves - and why? It is so pleasant if everybody gives attention and has consideration and dances around you like the golden calf. Nicole - I do not approve her actions, but I do understand her and have sympathy for her - is absolutely right when she says (spoiler alert) that Kate ruined James' life!! Well, he is to blame too, but not for the affair, but he should have divorced Kate long ago or at least not supported her this long and with this he enabled and reinforced her dwelling on her misery. I do not blame her for having the fears, but if she does not want to fight them for their own sake ( and she does not) and not for the sake of the people around her who she terrorizes completely with her madness, she should have left James and at best get a job where she can work at home without fellow workers. If she is alone she can be afraid and crazy as much as she likes, but if she wants attention and people around she has to fight to get better and not be so hideous and ruin James' life, who had been so kind and patient all along and does not deserve this, and Nicole's life. Not after what Kate did to James and what he did for her nevertheless. I am (only)quite  happy with one person's ending, and that is Simon's. He has truly suffered an awful fate, and he fares remarkably - completely the opposite of selfish, mean Kate. And I am happy that he gets a bit of happiness back in the end. Unfortunately with Kate, I really hope she treats him much, much better than James. She was James' doom and is an evil being if she doesn't change. But also good to see Kevin Zegers again in a role he deserves.",1450915200,,1873,4.131506849315069
8653839,3,B00JU28SXU,"A strong tale abouy how post traumatic stress can warp and damage it's sufferers and their families.  Simon Brunson(Kevin Zegers), a firefighter who has lost his arm in an explosion, is a PST sufferer completely focused on the unrealistic goal of passing a physical and returning to his job, starts a security job at a big box store.  The manager of the store,James Ascher (Corey Montieth) is hard charging career man who is about to climb the corporate ladder to regional sales rep. James' wife Kate (Karine Vaniasse) is suffering from PST too, after seeing her sister commit suicide. Her focus is on maintaining a personal space that she feels safe in. This involves never being touched. James sleeps on the couch. Her job involves watching the store's sercurity monitors in a cubicle with taped areas on the floor that no one can step over. When she informs James that she can't move to Toronto for his new job, he loses it. A year with no human contact makes him starved for any intimacy. More than willing to provide this is  Nicole (Emily Hampshire) a checkout girl at the store. Nicole is trying to struggle against an ex-husband who is an abusive drug abuser ans a low paying subsistance salary.  The interaction of all of these desires and impulses leavee twoo of the characters in a better place and two of them in a worse place.  Cory Monteith is excellent in this film. He is forceful, loving, driven and falling apart at the seams. Keven Zegers and Karine Vanasse work well together as the two of them nudge each other to recovery. Emily Hampshire is good too, as a trainwreck in the process of losing everything because she can't grow up. The only problem I had with the film was the ending. I feel the story got away from them. It was more important to punish the philanderer than to deal with the problems that led to cheating. In fact you never see Kate voice any concern about what her husband is feeling.",1435708800,2,1923,4.594752186588921
