4078463,5,B0036TGSWG,"Wonderful! Since others have already given a plot synopsis, I'll just add my delight at the combo of irreverent humor, shamanistic realism, gorgeous use of trad Celtic art forms, deep relationship with nature, the magic of writing, and small historical details that glitter like facets in this gem. For example, when the white cat appeared I hoped that his name would be Pangur Ban - and it was! What glee! (Yes, I am indeed a nerd.) Here's one version of the poem the name comes from, written by and about a monk circa 8th century BCE (from memory, so it may not be perfect):

 ""I and white Pangur Ban my cat
Each his special art works at.
Chasing mice is his delight;
Chasing words I do all night.""

This film is a delight that is sure to introduce many new folks to the luscious historical art form of Celtic knotwork, as well as to deep Irish history. Highly recommended. I just saw it, and want to again already, pausing to gape at the spiral variations. 'Nuff said.",1272499200,9,971,4.47457627118644

-----------

Do you know the name of the world's most visually stunning book?  It is illuminated, called The Book of Kells.  It was produced in the early 8th century in Scotland.  The book of Kells went on a long and arduous journey, somehow made its way to Trinity College in Dublin, where it resides today.  The rest in Real history!
 The Oscar-nominated animation ""The Secret of Kells"" is a story about a young orphaned boy Brendan, who lives in the Abby of Kells, under siege of the raiding Vikings.  Brendan's only family is his strict uncle, the powerful Abbott Cellach of Kells.  Although the Abbott loves his nephew, he doesn't have the right way.
 Soon, Brother Aidan, a master illuminator from a foreign land, came to the walled city of Kells.  He took Brendan under his wings and sent him on a journey to go into the forest to seek a special kind of berry: its juice can be made into emerald green-colored ink for writing ""The Book of Kells,"" yet to be finished.  Brother Aidan brought this sacred book with him, a book overflowing with wisdom and brilliant artistry, to be completed by Brendan!
 In the mysterious forest, Brendan is at first terrified of the strange sights and sounds.  He encounters a fairy that is unlike any other fairy in fairy tales.  Her name is Aisling.  She has many qualities that are lacking in ordinary fairies: She is completely white who can change into a wolf in an instant.  She has territorial instinct just like a wolf, but unlike a wolf, she can climb trees!  She does not have wings and is more agile on her feet.  It is hard to impress a fairy, but Brendan tried his best and eventually succeeded!  Together, the two must join forces to stop the Viking's invasion and find a magic crystal, so that Brendan can finish the last pages of the Sacred Book.
 I was thrilled to have the opportunity to interview director Tomm Moore from Ireland who made The Secret of Kells as his first feature length animation.  Moore loved comics and animation as a child.  He studied in the college Don Bluth helped set up - Ballyfermot Senior College, and started his own studio Cartoon Saloon with some friends back in the premises of Young Irish Filmmakers in Kilkenny.
My favorite characters are Brendan and Aisling.  Brendan is faithful, loyal, curious, hard-working, loves literature, and through Brother Aidan, discovers his own hidden artistic talents.  I am a master at art, just like Brendan, though my parents discovered my talents much earlier, as soon as I started drawing when I was three.  I consider myself a better artist than a film critic, because I have been creating art for a much longer time than reviewing movies!
I also share a great imagination and love for nature with Brendan.  I love to see wild animals in the natural ecosystem.  I also wrote and illustrated lots of books, such as ""Journey to Land,"" about the adventures of a pack of African cheetahs.  In my view, imagination is only ""magic"" to those who don't understand it.  To those who have imagination, art is simply a natural way to express that imagination.
I like Aisling because she acts most like a real kid.  She is a free spirit, and loyal to Brendan.  She was based on director Moore's own younger sister who ""had a similar personality, (a little pest!) and she had big eyes and bushy eyebrows, pink knees from climbing trees and playing outdoors and pale skin,"" said Moore.  ""Aisling is mostly made up as a representation of all the old Pagan gods and creatures who went before.  Aisling means dream or vision in Gealic.""  One of my favorite scenes is when Aisling magically turns Pangur Ban (Brother Aidan's mysterious cat with differing eye colors!) into a spirit as she sang a beautiful, haunting song.
 ""The Secret of Kells"" is an ""illuminating"" tale about friendship, wisdom, overcoming fear, and discovering your own creativity.  It has splendid visual, haunting music, and amazing storyline built upon historical facts.  I think this movie would appeal to a wide audience, although younger kids may be disturbed by the war scenes.
 I give the film 4.5 starfish.  It's Perrific!  I noticed that the cat, Pangur Ban, did not age as most of the human characters, nor did the old man with long beard who first discovered that Brendan was gone from his cell.  Are they magic?  I asked director Moore.  ""I get asked this all the time :) Well, for me, Pangur Ban is sort of a symbol of Aidan and Iona, she may be magical like Aisling,"" said Moore. ""Pabgur Ban IS kind of immortal because a monk wrote about his cat Pangur Ban in a poem that's in one of the manuscripts from that period, so school kids in Ireland learn about Pangur Ban to this day.  Or maybe the cat at the end is her daughter :)!""  Which one do you think is more likely?
 There were many similarities between ""The Secret of Kells"" and other ""Perrific"" animations.  It is visually stunning like one of my all-time favorites, the 5-starfish-rated ""Azur & Asmar,"" directed by the French animation master Michel Ocelot who became a dear friend of mine since I interviewed him in San Francisco last year.  Also the Princess Charnsous Sabah in ""Azur & Asmar"" was locked up in the palace and not allowed to leave; just like Brendan was forbidden to leave the walled fortress of Kells.
 Brendan, just like Hiccup in ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" lived a thrilling double life.  At the start of the film, Brendan was always thinking about what his uncle the Abbott Cellach would do to punish him.  Once he befriended Aisling, he forgot all about his worries and lost track of time.  Both Brendan and Hiccup lost their moms and had a strict father or father figure in their lives, who lacked confidence in the boys.  Both boys violated the rule of the leader, however, such violations transformed their lives permanently for good.  Each befriended a mystical creature who became their ally.  But Toothless is more than an ally, he gradually turned into a pet once Hiccup tamed him!  Aisling, however, kept her wild spirit and independence.
 I noticed that the Vikings in this film have eyes that are like glowing balls with dim light.  They are heartless and don't look human at all.  The Vikings show a lack of respect for artistry and human knowledge, as they rip the pages of the sacred Book of Kells.
 While other films have more complex visuals, ""The Secret of Kells"" succeeds in its own unique visual style: simple but elegant.  The lines that make up the human characters and objects are bold, decisive, and beautiful, suffused with splashes of vivid colors.  Adorned with priceless jewels, with a bright golden cover and pages that seemed to glow from within, The Book of Kells represents the power of art, literature, and human creativity itself.
 Friendship can heal your worries.  The path to enlightenment takes courage, creativity, and perseverance.",1270944000,5,6982,4.712634186622626
4078465,5,B0036TGSWG,"Movies like this convince me we're in a golden age for animation. This amazing little gem combines gorgeous imagery and fine storytelling with real Irish culture and history. The conflict between art and more down-to-earth concerns might be a bit heavy-handed in places, but everything else works beautifully. In particular, I couldn't help notice Brendan's utter unconcern about any mismatch between his Christian, monastic upbringing and his faerie friend - the pagan nestled neatly next to the religious life. The pervasive respect for art and artists probably owes a lot to Irish tradition, too.

Marvelous animation really brought this story to life for me, though. Different aspects of it invite comparison to many other greats of imagery: elements of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miyazaki/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miyazaki</a>&nbsp;in the forest, some of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ralph/dp/B001PQZYR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ralph</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bakshi/dp/B0001NBMIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bakshi</a>&nbsp;in the Norsemen and wolves, perhaps a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jay-Ward/dp/B000A345C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jay Ward</a>&nbsp;in some of the characters' appearance, and the book of Kells throughout. Image composition brought to mind church windows, triptych iconography, and much more - even eye color in Brendan, Aisling, and the cat was suggestive. Perhaps there's nothing new to be had in animation (an opinion I dispute), but there are always new combinations to be had. Any time a movie demands so many different comparisons to convey the feel of its imagery, I take that complexity as a mark of real originality. This wonderful film has it like few others do.

4078466,5,B0036TGSWG,"The Secret of Kells is a delightful animation out of Ireland and one of the films nominated for Best Animated Film at the 2010 Academy Awards. Sadly, not many people have heard of it in the US. It is the collaboration of several international studios (in Ireland, Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, and France) and a stellar example of top-notch animation. The distinct and inventive art style perfectly blends traditional 2D hand-drawn animations with CG and is a joy to look at. For fans of animation, it is well worth seeking out.

It is set in the early Middle Ages (800 CE) and concerns the creation of the Book of Kells, a masterwork of Celtic art/calligraphy and one of Ireland's most important national treasures. The story revolves around a young boy named Brendan who lives in the Abbey of Kells, from which the book gets its name. He is watched over by his uncle, the over-protective Abbot Cellach (Brendan Gleeson), who spends his days supervising the construction of a great wall to defend the inhabitants of the monastery from Norse invaders, the scourge of pre-Christian Europe. Brendan is forbidden to leave the city gates, but everything changes when Brother Aidan arrives, fleeing Viking raiders who destroyed his Scottish village of Iona with the partially finished manuscripts. Brendan curiosity gets the best of him and he becomes enthralled by the book, venturing into the forest for supplies against the orders of his uncle. Here he meets and befriends the forest spirit Aisling, and together they overcome a series of obstacles to complete the book.

The film isn't preachy, religiously suggestive, proselytizing, or heavy-handed. It just tells a story of a boy overcoming his fears and becoming a greater person, using a historical reference point as a backdrop. It has a fairy-tale charm that is easy to appreciate by kids and adults alike.

Visually, the animation style and character designs are very playful and inventive. Everyone has a very distinct stylized look. For example, the other monks are round or square, the Vikings are very angular, featureless, and cloaked in shadow. The backdrops have the look of hand-drawn and hand-painted water color, interwoven with 3D animations seamlessly composited into the scenes (things like butterflies, leaves, birds, smoke). Everything just feels right, unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Princess-and-the-Frog/dp/B0034JKZ86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Princess and the Frog</a>&nbsp;where the CG sometimes sticks out like a sore thumb. Animation fans will recognize the look because one of Cartoon Saloon's major clients is Cartoon Network. Aisling and some of the main characters, for example, have the style of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Clone-Wars-Animated-Series/dp/B0006Z2LMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars - Clone Wars Animated Series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powerpuff-Girls/dp/B000NVIG9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powerpuff Girls</a>.

A film so beautiful, only a Blu-ran can do it real justice!

Nominated for a 2010 Best Animated Feature, Secret of Kells is a movie that almost nobody has heard of because of a limited US release.  But it is by far and away the best film in its category.  A compelling mix of both Christian history and Celtic mythology, the story tells a fairy tale of Brendan and his quest to preserve and finish the most important book in history.

Beautifully animated, with rich colors and emphasis on simple geometrics, the film is shows why movies are a *visual* medium.  Utilizing a ""flat"" 2D style, with richly decorated backgrounds, and a varied character design, this motion picture is a true work of art.

Once again, Blu-ray is the medium this film is meant for.  Even DVD would fall short, due to its reduced color reproduction and resolution when compared to Blu-ray.

Please, please grace the US a Blu-ray release!",1267747200,21,1041,4.583783783783784
4078470,5,B0036TGSWG,"Brendan dreams of writing the greatest book of all time, but he's stifled by his uncle, Abbot Cellach, who wants Brendan to be practical and help build a wall around the village of Kells to help protect them from an impending Viking attack. When Brother Aidan turns up from another village that's already been attacked by the vikings, he captivates Brendan because he was a great writer, and he asks Brendan to help him finish the now legendary Book of Kells. Now, Brendan must defy his uncle's warnings and venture into the forest outside Kells and confront his fears of the ""Dark One"" to find inspiration to finish the great Book of Kells.

The Academy Awards have a tendency to nominate a lot of films that have only been released in limited release and are not very widely seen. Some people see this as a detriment, thinking that the Academy has lost touch because it typically doesn't look at the more widely seen and generally loved movies. In my opinion this is actually a strength, when awards season rolls around I'm looking up those other movies to catch the gems that I missed, knowing that something great is out there that should have been released wide. That's the case with The Secret of Kells. To be honest, and it's kind of sad, I'm not too familiar with animation outside of anime and American anime. Thanks to the Academy Awards, though, I found out about this great animated feature.

Kells is the type of movie that kind of has one foot planted in fantasy and legend, and another foot planted in reality. The Book of Kells is a real historical book created around the 6th to 9th centuries and is considered Ireland's finest national treasure. The origin of the Book of Kells is still widely disputed, so the creation of the book is ripe to made into a film of sorts. In The Secret of Kells, the story revolves around an older monk teaching a child about inspiration and art to create the Book of Kells. In reality, it seems the major theme of this movie deals with one generation teaching another generation about the art of hand drawn animation. In a day and age when computer animation has all but taken over for the older hand drawn animation, it's great to see a film that's more of a call to the old traditions and does it so well. The Secret of Kells is beautifully rendered to the screen, as well as highly original, still looking better than a lot of computer animated features that come out these days which makes it's message that much more potent as well.

I highly recommend this film to anyone that like animated features of any kind. You'll find certain similarities to anime, as well as older animated films like some of the early adaptations of Rudyard Kipling books like Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and the like. Honestly, this might even be my favorite animated film of the year so far, at least it's very close between this and Up. Definitely give it a shot, great animated feature!

4078590,5,B0036TGSWG,"I LOVE the animation in this film. Its very different from a lot of movies. It goes very well with the theme of the movie and the illuminated manuscripts. There are some scary parts of the movie. They are pretty intense for the preschool age crowd and maybe up to middle grade school ages if you have kids that are more sensitive to scary things. I found it pretty intense and I am in my 30s. Of course, I was also watching with my kids so I was hoping it didn't scare them too much. Either way, this definitely a movie you will want to watch before watching with your kids.

And, if you don't have kids you might still really enjoy this movie. The animation really is unique. The story line is unique. The music is calm and peaceful. Except for some intense parts (invaders, the creepy mysterious darkness, assumed death) its a very mellow movie.",1471564800,5,847,4.3949044585987265
4078591,5,B0036TGSWG,"I won't go into detail about what was good about this movie because everything about it works so well, the music, the art, characters, story and songs... everything. The fear for some is that due to the movies pacing and use of religious symbolism throughout, the meaning of the movie will be lost on younger children. I originally watched this with my little sister of seven years and she was completely enthralled from beginning to end. She did ask a few questions afterwards and with a little explaining and a bit of research I'm certain this movie will not be lost on anyone.",1471046400,,579,4.631067961165049

Through all of these trials, the boy grows up to write and illuminate the stunningly beautiful Book of Kells.  Go to KissCartoon and give it a watch, then come back here to get yourself a copy.

The story follows a very long span of time but FOCUSES on a very short period. It seems a bit unbalanced but the characters, voice acting, art and animation are some of the most extraordinary on record. This film is drowning in style. It's an explosion of color, texture, shape and motion. It's a unique expression of animation the likes of which I have never seen and it all swims effortlessly within the core of the subject matter. I won't tell you what that subject is as I don't want to spoil anything, but once you see it you'll know what I mean. They took a theme and boiled everything on the screen down to the heart of it.

4078912,3,B0036TGSWG,"Although I had heard of this movie when it first came out (thanks to its nomination at the Oscars), it wouldn't be until now that I finally sat down to watch it.  Part of the motivation is attributed to this same studio producing the more recent film, ""Song of the Sea""--another story dealing with Irish mythology. After greatly enjoying that movie, I thought it was high time to give this crew's previous film a watch.

In the end, I'm a bit torn.  While I LOVED the art and animation, the story, while good, leaves me wondering if I'm even the right person to be reviewing this.

In a remote outpost of Ireland, sometime in the eighth century, a 12 year old boy named Brendan has lived within the walled monastery of Kells. His uncle, Abbot Cellach, keeps a stern watch over him--forbidding the boy from ever venturing beyond the fortified walls, which he insists on building to keep out Viking raiders that threaten to destroy Irish civilization.  One day, a famous, master illuminator named Brother Aidan comes seeking refuge at the monastery; bringing with him a book that's filled with secret wisdom and powers. When it becomes clear that the threat of the Vikings will soon be upon them, Brendan takes it upon himself to help Brother Aidan complete the unfinished manuscript. To do so, he'll have to venture beyond the walls and into the forest; confronting all sorts of dangers, including mythical creatures, his deepest fears, and a manifestation of evil itself...but it also wins him the friendship of Aisling, a mysterious forest fairy, as well as opens his eyes to the literal art of enlightenment.

What immediately stuck out to me is the artwork.  It's easily some of the greatest and most beautiful animation I've ever seen. The colors are bright and fluid, and the attention to certain details (such as running a finger across a bird feather) are astounding. Even certain scenes are set up to evoke the feel of one reading a story book--images and words literally leap off the page (especially during the film's finale). It really makes me wish that this studio would've won the Oscar, as 2-D animation as beautiful as this really needs more attention in an age where everything is made on computers now (with Pixar dominating the box office at every turn).

However, the part that gets a bit confusing for me is the story itself. I know next to nothing about Irish mythology, so going into this, I half expected to come out knowing a little more about the folk lore than I did previously (as what happened to me after watching ""Song of the Sea""). A similar scenario happened to me after viewing ""The Book of Life"" (about Mexico's Day of the Dead festival)--everything was simplified and explained in a way that a general audience unfamiliar with the holiday would understand. This film, on the other hand, definitely requires you to have a base knowledge of certain mythical creatures, as well as Ireland's infamous 'Book of Kells', which, after some research, I found out is a hand-written copy of the New Testament's four Gospels, completed by Celtic monks. There's nothing wrong with a movie being made with a specific audience in mind....it just pays to know beforehand what you're getting into. On the one hand, having to look up the various people/places/references/etc. can be a great learning experience. But on the other hand, for folks who just want to be entertained without having to work, they can wind up very confused (as some will argue ""if I have to read a book to understand a movie, then the movie hasn't done its job""). All I'm saying is, if you're unfamiliar with Irish folklore and/or The Book of Kells, be prepared to have a ton of questions after seeing this.

Never the less, despite getting a bit confused at times (as well as the voice actors heavy Irish accents taking some getting used to), I still understood the general gist of what was going on, and the striking imagery certainly helped. It's not just a story about Christianity coming to Ireland, but also a tale about the power of art, learning to be adventurous, and finding beauty even in the darkest of places. As Brother Aidan tells Brendan (and the audience), ""the book was never meant to be hidden away behind a wall, locked away from the world which inspired its creation...you must take the book to the people so that they may have hope; let it light the way in these dark days.""

While I enjoyed ""Song of the Sea"" a little more (mainly because the story and mythology was much easier to follow), this is still a film that any lover of animation should watch. Although, I highly recommend this for kids 10 and older, due to more than a few frightening images and jump scares, as well as a heavy subject matter that might go over their heads. Any younger, and I would pre-screen this first to see if your kids are ready for such material.",1447545600,3,4847,4.691764705882353

I think the artistic style is very unique, beautiful and interesting and the story is also pretty good. I should note that my husband thinks this movie is slow. It is really dialogue dependent. There is some action, but unless you've been paying close attention to all the dialogue you will be confused about what's going on. It's really a personality thing. My oldest daughter is very different from my husband is some ways.
She loves nature and wolves and anything mysterious and mischievous so upon her request I made her an Aisling costume for Halloween this year. It was so perfect for her.

The book of Kells represents all that is beautiful, magical, innovative and good in the world, while the wall represents the need for security, conservative actions and the closed mindedness. In other words, a battle between good and evil, between intangible and tangible values, between happiness and fear.

Besides that, the amazing artwork is a wonder to behold. It shows the world in a completely new way, combining medieval perspective with contemporary special effects and features. It is the way I see the world when I have an idea, regretfully I am not able to execute it so masterfully. Anyhow, sit back, relax and be amazed by this fairytale beyond your wildest dreams.

4078965,4,B0036TGSWG,"For whatever reason, I never finished watching The Secret of Kells a few years ago. I got about 20 minutes into it, had to do something, and just kind of left it for dead, despite it holding my interest. After watching it tonight, I feel guilty, because this is one of the better animated movies Ive seen in the last couple of years.

Brendan is a young boy living in a small village, surrounded by a giant wall. Its being built to keep enemy invaders out when they arrive, and the construction is led by Abbot Cellah. Cellach is a tall, stern man who has nothing on his mind except the safety of his people. Everyone else seems to be fine building the wall and going about their lives as usual. We soon find out how important books are to the people, since without them, history would be lost forever. One day, Aidan, a great man from a far away land who was working on a special book, comes to the town. Hes very kind, full of personality, and while he is revered and respected, Abbot Cellach doesnt give him any special treatment, as the wall is his number one concern. Aidan asks Brendan to do a favor for him one day, in finding special berries in the woods outside of the town. The boy isn't allowed to go beyond the walls because its dangerous, but he goes, and begins a journey of his own that will affect the lives of many people, within and outside of the walls.

Its hard to give The Secret of Kells a real plot summary because most of the action happens near the middle and towards the end. Early on, we get a lot of time with Brendan and Aiden, building up their characters and learning more about them and how things are going for the people. Abbot Cellach insists that invaders are coming, though he has no time in mind for when its going to happen. Its through other people like Aidan, that we learn how bad the invaders are, and how merciless they are, leaving no survivors when they attack villages. Slowly but surely, the invaders come, and what few survivors make it out of the raids, come to Kells for shelter. A lot of what happens before the invaders make their presence known is Brendan learning about the book that Aidan is writing, and learning that he will take part in authoring it as well. As vague as it is, its all very interesting and sure to keep the viewers attention until the end. The Secret of Kells also has some beautiful animation that, while Im not a big fan of the style, it works perfectly with the plot and tone of the movie. Even better though, is the voice acting. Nearly every single character here sounds like a regular person talking. Kids are voiced by kids! Can you believe it?! Adults sound like real adults too! No over-acting or terrible exaggerated voices like you see in a lot of animated movies and shows.

My only issue with the movie is something that may not exactly be fair to bring up. Let me again say that I did love the movie. It has a great story, isn't predictable, has real characters you can get behind and care about, and it never once drags on or has a scene that feels out of place. That being said, I think a lot of people will be lost on what exactly the secret is, and whats so special about the book that Aidan and Brendan are working on. I kept waiting for them to bring up whats in the book, to flat-out say what it contains or give a rundown of it. Sure, I know what the books about and am familiar with the religious aspects, but they never come out and say it, or even hint at it. All youll get it that the book contains the light that will get rid of darkness. It becomes very obvious near the end of the movie what it contains, but I can still see some people being lost on what its about, especially those who have zero knowledge when it comes to religion (and there are plenty of those these days). My other little nitpick is that a major scene that happens about 3/4 though happens very suddenly and is over as quickly as it started. It didn't have any impact on me or draw me in like a lot of the other scenes, especially one where Brendan has to find an important jewel. It felt like it was in the movie because they had to have it there, but not much time was spent on it. Granted, I didn't want this scene to take up most of the movie or anything. Some more time wouldve been appreciated though to give it some meaning.

Those little issues aside, I definitely recommend The Secret of Kells to anyone who wants a good animated movie. It has just about everything you could ask for and is one of the rare movies that I can say Id be happy to watch again and again. Younger kids will be able to handle it, as it doesnt have any blood or overly scary scenes. Its a shame this one doesnt get as much attention as other animated features, because it deserves it.",1444780800,,4747,4.259423503325943

4079002,5,B0036TGSWG,Awesome animation. I am definitely keeping an eye on this animation team. They combine traditional animation techniques with anime and computer animation to create a very wonderfully stylistic feature.

4079013,5,B0036TGSWG,"A well thought-out story with beautiful animation, The Secret of Kells is an intriguing watch from start to finish, with somewhat frightening visuals and concepts presented but not abused. I recommend this to anyone who likes animation and good storytelling in general",1442188800,,268,5.404761904761905

4079015,5,B0036TGSWG,"This is a beautifully animated piece that fictionalizes (and mythologizes) the creation of an actual masterpiece, the Book of Kells. The story is simple but compelling. The artistic styles are similarly simple and evocative, with the protagonists in earth tones, the villains in stark blacks and reds, and the illuminations in full, dazzling colors of all hues. It's kind of a Celtic *Samurai Jack*-- in style, not story. Although the theme of hope in the face of overwhelming evil runs in both works. In any event, I am very glad to have stumbled upon this lovely film.",1442016000,2,570,4.88659793814433
4079016,3,B0036TGSWG,"I don't think this would be appropriate for young children - way too dark and scary.  Plus, the movie moves along too slowly - more for the attention span of a teen or adult.

However, the artwork is gorgeous.  I wish they had spent more time showing the Book of Kells, which is a Book of the Gospels.",1441929600,,301,4.155172413793103
4079017,4,B0036TGSWG,"The artwork was amazing and rivaled the actual Book of Kells. It was a delightful story that was a simplified version of history. Interesting depiction of the Vikings as giant monsters which they probably seemed to be when they first attacked the shores of Ireland. The view of a faerie was a nice touch that gave a fantastical, if balanced, view of the Pagans and Christians who inhabited the island at the time. I could see that it could be scary for little kids but not more so than Snow White or many other animations. Nice job.",1441929600,,532,4.494845360824742

4079021,5,B0036TGSWG,"Beautiful movie, following the origin, loss and recovery of the book of Kells. It was a history lesson for myself and children. The animation is fanciful and artistic. Most of the human figures have exaggerated features (e.g., height, weight). There are wolves in the forest that might be frightening for a child younger than 5.",1441756800,,328,4.9818181818181815

4079035,5,B0036TGSWG,"This movie is just absolutely beautiful.  It has fairies and dark secrets.

4079039,3,B0036TGSWG,Expected much more in story and emotion from a animated feature nominated for Best Animated Film.  I love the 2D art work but visuals only can go so far as the story was a short story dragged out to feature length.  It would have worked better at half the timing - as a short.  But the fact that it was made by animators around the world is very impressive.,1440979200,,357,4.144927536231884

4079073,4,B0036TGSWG,This was different.  I like the artistry and ink drawing and the way it was shown.  The story was interesting on how the world was when the great books were written by men when books were not popular to have if they were even known to exist.  It seems a story depicting how Christianity had pagan beliefs so outlawed that men were afraid to believe in something because it wasn't supposed to exist and if it did it had to be bad.,1440374400,,429,4.2073170731707314

4079137,5,B0036TGSWG,"This is one of the most beautiful and imaginative animations I have ever seen. I am so tired of the Disney look and formula. This film was done by hand, not computers. It's also a wonderful story, maybe a little scary for young children but my 5 year old granddaughter loves it. It transcends ages, so children, teenagers and adults will all appreciate it. Be sure to also check out ""Song of the Sea,"" produced by the same Irish company, Cartoon Saloon. These are both film you won't soon forget.",1438473600,,496,4.522222222222222

I would watch it a few more times to get everything out of it - it's a little hard to follow the first time as the story gets slightly convoluted towards the end. The 'bad guys' in this were pretty scary, and my 7 year old had a lot of questions about them.

4079159,5,B0036TGSWG,"Fantastic little film that went under the radar, at least to me. The animation is a breath of fresh air and it looks as if it came straight out of a stained glass window or an old storybook. The story is that on an old fairy tale or legend. If you are familiar with more mainstream media like the Legend of Zelda games (Moreso the Wind Waker) then the story won't fell extremely unfamiliar. A great watch for adults and kids and thankfully different compared to the likes of Frozen and Minions (Which I personally despise.)",1437523200,,523,4.458333333333333

When I first found this movie, I didn't know what I was getting into but I was immediately thrown into the story and the lives that it told. I cared about the Uncle and his nephew. I cared about the monks and the Illuminator. I cared about the lone fairy child that lives in the forest. This movie draws you in to a world of imagination, beauty, fear, wonder, and love. I seriously recommend you buying this movie.",1436054400,,501,4.397849462365591
4079199,5,B0036TGSWG,"We had been lucky enough to see this movie in the theatres  when it came out, but since it wasn't a Disney big budget picture, you may have missed it.  A charming story that gives insights into Ireland a long time ago. The main character is a very relatable boy.  The best part was that the artwork of the film itself was distinctively Celtic, just as anime is distinctively Japanese.

Our middle school was studying Celtic art for an art literacy program. I bought this movie for teachers to use for any free class periods they had afterward. The kids really loved it--both for the story and pointing out to their teachers the things they had learned about Celtic art.",1436054400,,669,4.55

This movie conveys the story of a famous medieval illuminated manuscript and those associated with it in a way that is both engaging and profound by personifying three cultures that were struggling with one another during the era of the books creation and allowing you to feel the depth of history on all sides while somehow maintaining an overall light-hearted and fun tone.

4079473,4,B0036TGSWG,"Charming, visually delightful and unique.  Animation style similar to Samurai Jack.  Although the story is about a young monk in an Abby and his journey to create the Book of Kells (an annotated version of the New Testament that is unique in its graphic style and beautiful details), they lost a star for being afraid of Christian content.

The only vague reference to Christianity at all (which is pretty amazing given the subject) is a cryptic reference to the Chi Rho pages having the magical power to turn darkness into light (as if the book was a spell book)  Chi Rho is, of course, an early Christian monogram for the Christ (Jesus, or more accurately Yashua, which means ""God with us""). Chi Rho is written like a P superimposed on an X both evoked the cross and formed the first letters of ""Christus"" the greek word for the Messiah.  Additionally, prior to Christianity, the Greeks had used the symbol to represent good, ""Chreeston"" in Greek, which may be the origin of the term Christian (the ""good people"").",1428624000,10,1016,4.7175141242937855

I tried to pause it to get something from the kitchen and she was not pleased. Her twin brother didn't pay too much attention to it. I thought that it was actually pretty scary, but I likes the vikings being portrayed more as monsters than people. Loses a star because they don't really go into WHY the book is important.

4079515,5,B0036TGSWG,"I first stumbled upon this movie on Netflix. I was pleasantly surprised and began my love for European 2d animation. The backgrounds and stunning and beautifully drawn with great use of foreshortening. The movie is ultimately about the Book of Kells and its creation, though the book is not the main focus of the story. The story is simple with a boy and his goal of becoming a great illuminator with the help of his new faerie friend, Aisling and his mentor, Aiden. The characters are likable, if not wholly complex, and have complicated relationships with one another, especially between Brendan and his Uncle.
The story also has some dark elements and imagery which may frighten younger viewers, but I appreciated this movie all the more for it. If 2009 wasn't such a stellar year for animated movies, this would have won Best Animated Feature. The ending is bittersweet, if a tad rushed, with the masterpiece revealed at the end.",1427068800,,933,4.8375

4079672,5,B0036TGSWG,"Animation fans will delight in the obvious love that the animators have infused liberally into every stylized stroke here. The artwork is both unique and highly memorable. The deeper theme of the importance of artwork to the survival and flourishing of culture is well developed, but some of the storytelling stumbles a bit.

The opening scenes include the slapstick chase of a bird through the mud: these will amuse some small children but leave many adults bored or rolling their eyes. Don't give up on it here: it gets much better after the first fifteen or twenty minutes. There are also some clichd children's tropes about being true to yourself and your calling that won't do much for older audiences. These moments feel like a modest bit of pandering to children.

These flaws keep it from being one of the great all-ages animated masterpieces, but it's still a great movie that blends history, art and mythology with beautiful animation and music that is truly memorable. There are a few scenes that may be too scary for some younger children, but there's no generally objectionable content. Most will enjoy this and animation fans will love this. An especially good choice for parents who want something a little deeper and more thoughtful than the much children's fare, but recommended for childless adults as well. 4.5 stars",1413676800,,1335,4.955357142857143

The sort of movie that you just find so rarely now-a-days in an animated feature with the exception of Pixar films. Except this time the animation and watercolor backgrounds are hand drawn. Not like most animation today where even new animated Disney films mix in a fair bit of computer generated magic. As an artist I completely appreciate the look and feel of the film. At times the character animation feels a little simplistic or overly stylized however the design and backgrounds add a wonderful sense of style that fits in perfectly with the sort of art that I like. Even for the characters you can see that the animators were heavily influenced by the style of painting around the time of the 6th century when perspective was flattened and faces similarly stylized. The story is straight forward enough: a small city (Kells) preparing for a Viking attack while the most important book in Irish history (The Book of Kells) is being worked on. The small boy Brendan grows to learn how to do the illumination and not surprisingly is the last hope for completing the book. A nice mix of mystical characters also add life to the film and and anyone who is a fan of cats will smile at the inclusion of a cute white kitty Pangur Ban (named after an Irish poem). For a fairly unknown film except in animation circles I really enjoyed it and recommend it. Even if you aren't an animation fan but have a little over an hour to spend on something visually exciting go for it...check it out!

It was really neat to learn more about the history behind this movie, to discover that the Book of Kells is one of Ireland's national treasures and that this movie depicted a legendary story of how the Book of Kells came to be.

Some of the viking parts seem a little scary for younger viewers, but she isn't bothered a bit.

4079703,5,B0036TGSWG,Amazing animation. One of a kind. Disney is not even close to it. The Secret of Kells is a work of art and a must see. Also a very moving and inspiring plot.

I enjoyed sitting and watching it with my grand daughter.  It was a good way to discuss some of the history and although this is not a factual documentary, it definitely follows a great bit of history with Irish music, whimsy and beautiful illustrations.

I don't recommend it for very young children because even though it is animated there are some scenes that might be disturbing to younger children.,1404864000,,362,4.4393939393939394

4079727,3,B0036TGSWG,"The artistic creativity was wonderful, inspired by and deliberately resonating with the most beautiful illuminated manuscripts. Some of the characters were disney-esque: a huge black man, a rotund Italian cook. They seemed unnecessary.  The story tells the origin of the Book of Kells, and matches currently accepted theories. I found it interesting that the book was treated as a sacred, magical object, in and of itself, and divorced from its connection to Christianity. The admixture of celtic magical beings was also nice, speaking to the blended mystical beliefs of that time.  But I especially enjoyed the artwork.",1403049600,4,620,5.381443298969073

4079732,2,B0036TGSWG,"It might be worth watching if you have a hankering for beautiful celtic artwork, but the story has almost no plot.  It's extremely scary for young children.  The book itself is a let-down.  No magical powers, no great stories to make it anything special.  I won't watch it again.",1402099200,2,279,4.63265306122449

4079737,5,B0036TGSWG,"The style of animation was so unique, we just couldn't take our eyes off of it.  The music was very fitting, and the storyline was fast-paced enough for 21st-century kids.

It was a bit dark in sections that dealt with the Northmen (or Vikings) but that was a part of Irelands history, which my children understood as well.  My daughter (7 year old) completely got that Aisling was sort of the ""spirit of the forest"" and loved her best.  Especially the song ""Pangur Ban"" -- very enjoyable movie -- our family has watched it twice already.  It goes without saying that the art in this movie is breathtaking!",1400803200,,585,4.523809523809524
4079741,5,B0036TGSWG,"It's a bizarre little film that seems to lack a certain coherency, delivering a wave of hypnotic imagery and an absolutely beautiful score punctuating its deeper subtexts. Within 75 minutes The Secret of Kells paints a strikingly realized portrait (both figuratively and literally) with a lightning pace that incredibly is simultaneously able to offer a brilliantly meditated message on the importance of art in an unforgiving world, where simple words on a page can seem insignificant against security and survival.",1400544000,,516,5.4625
4079742,5,B0036TGSWG,"We have enjoyed this beautifully animated story many times.

4079754,5,B0036TGSWG,"The story is a good one, none of the currently accepted brattiness in the main characters. The animation is unusual and captivating. The battles aren't graphic, but there are a couple and they could be a little tense for a sensitive child. Music is nice too. I'd say 6 and up on this one.",1397692800,,288,4.351851851851852

4079759,5,B0036TGSWG,"The story and the animation artistry creats a whole new art genre for animation film.  Brilliancies of patterns and color clearly readable throughout the storyline.  The pattern and the weave of the storyline itself seemed intentional to maintaining arcaical stereotypes for boys and girls with girls being given a lesser value, as being evil and purposeless in comparison with the young lad in the story.  I believe in strong affirmation of young boys in children's literature, and never at the expense of the virtue of the younger girls, too, Everybody wins in growing up when both genders have stories that bring out both their best in the storyline of the younthful characters, as well as for the children watching and being influnced by the film.  While the film was a visual delight, the underlying story for children left me perceiving a less than respectful balance of value for both boys as much as for girls.  I wish I could give it five stars, because visually it is spectacular.",1396915200,,990,4.869047619047619

4079761,5,B0036TGSWG,"The artwork is stunning, very stylized and stylish.  It's a definite work of art.  The story involves conflict on a lot of different levels.  There's the Abbot Cellach who is obsessed with building a wall high enough and strong enough to keep out marauding bands of Vikings.  The result is a prison that keeps everyone in while guaranteeing no level of safety or security.  The Abbot is an odious fearmonger who rules without an ounce of compassion.  ""It will be as I say!""  He is charged with the duty of raising his nephew Brendan.  Even while the boy's imagination is set afire, the Abbot works twice as hard to quash it, believing in his wall to the exclusion of everything else.  The Vikings do come and the wall proves ineffectual in keeping people out or in.  With the help of a fairy (Aisling), a protectress of a forest, and a well-meaning Brother Aidan, Brendan eventually discovers his true calling as a master illuminator.

This movie is touching, humorous, exciting, and thought provoking.  It's quite magnificent and a welcomed addition to my library.",1396569600,,1065,4.791208791208791
4079762,5,B0036TGSWG,"Being an artist, I was overwhelmed by the animation on this project.  My daughter, who also is an artist, took inspiration from this film to continue drawing and animating.  The visual effect of the artwork is to make the story poignant and powerful beyond just words, music, and some pictures.  It is a masterpiece artistically speaking, both in visuals and the music, which lends itself to a sometimes other-worldly feel that heightens the effect of the visuals.  And the story itself is powerful, showing the pursuit of a boy's dream, the depth of love & sacrifice, and the historical elements of this Irish tradition.  All elements combine to make a powerful, gorgeous story that should not be missed!",1396483200,,705,4.940677966101695
4079763,4,B0036TGSWG,Good flick....I truly enjoyed the  visuals and the storyline. The end was a tiny bit disappointing but I liked it all in all,1395705600,,124,4.391304347826087
4079764,5,B0036TGSWG,"At first I was skeptical because of the animation style but I am very happy that I chose to give it a shot. It's almost like a Celtic style Miyazaki film. Although as a fair warning to helicopter moms: it does have a few ""darker"" moments. I wasn't worried about it with my daughters because their favorite movies right now are Jurassic Park and Howl's Moving Castle.

Regardless, this movie is worth the watch.",1395705600,,410,4.54054054054054
4079765,5,B0036TGSWG,"Everything about this film is brilliant. The whimsical and touching story is brought to life by artful animation married with a perfectly done musical score. While this is an animated feature i would not recommend this for young children due to ""battle scene violence"".",1395532800,,269,5.136363636363637

4079767,5,B0036TGSWG,"If you're a visual person, you'll love it. The animation is unlike what you've probably seen; it's more like illustration (appropriate to the book that is the theme), with animated layers interwoven.

If you're not a visual person -- well, there are other things for you to enjoy that are comparable, a symphony, or a feast.",1395187200,,324,4.785714285714286

4079770,5,B0036TGSWG,This is a good movie to teach the history of Ireland at the beginning of the Dark Ages. I paired this movie with looking at a copy of the Book of Kells.,1395187200,,152,3.78125
4079771,5,B0036TGSWG,"I really loved the artwork on this. The clouds are Celtic knotwork, that sort of thing. It's beautiful, and it's different. If you like Celtic artwork, you should definitely watch this movie.

Not much is known about the actual Book of Kells, but they do use the few known facts as the basis for the story. The Irish and French animation studios give it a noticeably different feel from the average Hollywood production. Definitely a very Celtic feel to all aspects of it, especially (of course) the artwork.",1395100800,,508,4.7727272727272725
4079772,5,B0036TGSWG,"We found this gem when my son's friend recommended it.  He's nine, and we both were entranced for the entire hour and ten minutes.  One of the most gorgeous movies I have ever seen.  I would almost compare it to ""Spirited Away,"" which I know is a huge influence on the director.
There is a fair amount of implied violence (all stylized) towards the end of the movie, so younger audiences (four or five) might find it a little scary.  It has none of the formula Pixar plot devices (no wisecracking sidekicks or talking animals) but the one song is haunting and the connection to Ireland's past, and how much of European culture was preserved in the Abbeys that dot the landscape is celebrated in this extraordinary and touching movie.
It's tragic how few people know of this film, and anything I can do to get it wider audience (I will be telling most of the parents I know about it) I will.",1395100800,,890,4.441717791411043

4079774,4,B0036TGSWG,"The Secret of Kells was a randomly chosen feature on Amazon Prime and I recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful work of animation for adults (and children, but unlike most ""mainstream"" animation features it is not childish or pushing toys). The music is excellent, the story is well written and the animation style is unique and perfect for the mood of the film. I'll watch it again, certainly.",1394928000,,401,4.742857142857143

4079778,5,B0036TGSWG,This movie has such a strong story. My friend thought it was a bit too slow and intellectual for his kids but I don't see how. Many children love this movie. Soundtrack is very nice. And the visuals in this flick are amazing. If an artist does not get inspiration from watching this movie they are out of their mind. Great buy.,1394496000,,327,4.290322580645161
4079779,5,B0036TGSWG,We (My 6 year old and my 3 1/2 year old) really enjoy this movie.  The story has captured my kids' imagination and is rich enough for me to enjoy as well.

4079786,4,B0036TGSWG,It was beautiful to watch. The story line and voices were remarkable for bringing the characters and story to life.  The Art work wove it all together.,1393459200,,151,4.592592592592593
4079787,3,B0036TGSWG,"Characters are unlikable.  Plot is incredibly boring and dry.  Voice acting is right down the middle.

This movie is a waste of the gorgeous, stunning, absolutely phenomenal animation style.  The fact that they chose such terribly dry and mundane subject matter just makes me want to scream.  This movie could've been so much more, if it had been about something else.  But, instead, you're left with unlikable characters going through an unlikable story, only to reach a mediocre end.  I can't believe they squandered this unique art style on such a piss poor plot.  I was actually angry about it, since I had never seen anything like this art style before.  It's really that good.  But, the rest of it is rubbish.  My boyfriend and I agreed that the only reason we wanted to watch it all the way through was for the art and that the rest of it was completely disposable.

If you love unique animation style, bright vivid colors and scenery, and artwork with a very magical feel, then this is worth the watch.  Just be warned that you might not like much else about it.",1393372800,2,1070,4.597883597883598
4079788,5,B0036TGSWG,"My family first watched this about a year ago.  We did have a basic understanding of Irish and Celtic mythology, but did not understand some of the imagery and symbolism used in this movie.  I was able to go to Scotland and Ireland soon after, and learned about the rich history in these countries.  We watched this again shortly after we got home, and was amazed at all we had missed, and now recognized.  We were able to see the Book of Kells on display in Trinity College in Dublin.  The artwork in that book is incredible!  We also were able to recognize other things, like where Brendan wakes up in a cave, it looks a lot like the interior of a very large structure in Ireland called Newgrange.  ""Bringing light to darkness"" is a great analogy of bringing Christianity to a pagan people, while still using their traditions and building on their beliefs.  This is a fun story to watch, and does a great job of bringing fantasy, mythology, and history to life.  I definitely recommend this to anyone, and would encourage them to look at how it portrays Irish history and mythology.",1393113600,,1084,4.546391752577319

4079799,4,B0036TGSWG,Kind of a weird ending and a little scary for younger ones.  Other than that we enjoyed watching this as a family.,1392076800,,114,4.181818181818182
4079800,5,B0036TGSWG,"This is a great movie. The artwork is so unique and so different from anything else out there. It's a great story about the monks who used to make copies of the bible by hand and ""illuminate"" and illustrate the pages. Every time we watch it we get something new out of it.",1391990400,,272,4.150943396226415
4079801,5,B0036TGSWG,"This film is beautiful in many respects.  The plot is delivered with subtlety and symbol.  There are points of accessibility and whimsy that make room for younger viewers.  The hardest parts of the story, the forces of evil and violence, are portrayed with powerful but not overwhelming allegory and imagery. The animation style brought me back to some of my childhood favorites from the 1960s and 1970s.

If you are looking for something delivering the usual, cookie-cutter plots and characters of big-time animated features, you will be frustrated.  If you are ready to leave that behind and return to a wonderful marriage of animation and imagination, you will find it here.",1391904000,,677,5.063063063063063

4079822,3,B0036TGSWG,"I study the Book of Kells and illuminated manuscripts.  I salivated in anticipation of this movie, particularly when I learned it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Film for 2010.  My husband, teenage son and I headed out for the historic Oriental Theater in Milwaukee, a gorgeous throw-back to the movie houses of the 1920's, bought our popcorn and sodas and settled in for a fine time.  And it was a fine time...except...er...where are the Kells?  I loved the character Aislinn, the little free-spirited sprite: without her, this movie would have been way too dark and turgid.  But what I longed for during the entire movie was finally provided in the last 2 glorious minutes of manic animation of the actual lettering, the ILLUMINATED lettering that is what the Book of Kells is all about.  I wanted to see that beauty all through the film!!

So, yes, I recommend this movie but not for the story, such as it is.  Heck, I barely remember the plot.  The last 2 minutes makes it worth the wait but, oh, it took a little long to get there.",1389571200,6,1049,4.566844919786096

4079824,5,B0036TGSWG,My daughter loves this movie and after watching it once or twice from start to finish I can understand why. Great art work and music really make the movie. While the movie does reference Christian beliefs it also weaves celtic myth into the story.

4079826,3,B0036TGSWG,It is a nice alternative to your typical animation movie. I was hoping for something more like a studio Gigli movie. This one has a nice story but I do think it needed some lighter moments of humor for the kids to carry along.,1388620800,,226,4.159090909090909

4079830,5,B0036TGSWG,I love the style of the animation. I have not seen anything close to this. The characters are driven by real motives. The story is tragic with hints of playful youthfulness. If you enjoy animation this story is fresh and beautifully done.,1387843200,,238,4.690476190476191
4079831,5,B0036TGSWG,"Yes, it is not true to history in the fullest of senses, but it is a great introduction to Irish myth and mythology between the Gaelic Pagan times and Christian times, around the Viking raids. Beautiful style to it as it shows a modernization of traditional Irish style drawing. Aisling and Crom Cruic and the Illuminators, all beautiful.

4079842,5,B0036TGSWG,"Amid the flood of computer-generated animation films bursting with shallow pop culture references, this lovely little film is like a green-gold flower, pure & shining with its rich simplicity. The art alone is astonishing in its faithfulness to the Book of Kells itself, vibrant with tiny details & vivid colors -- it truly imparts a sense not only of place, but of frame of mind. It's clear at once that the film is talking about, and is itself, something timeless & for the ages, rather than being mere disposable pop trash created to grind out merchandising dollars.

Now, there have been some complaints that it tones down the specifically Christian aspect of the Book of Kells & that it's not historically accurate. I submit that this well-meant argument is really beside the point. While the film uses history as a starting point, this is poetry & art, not hard fact -- the point is metaphor & even allegory, depicting an eternal human struggle between destructive, devouring greed that sees only materialism & power as human needs, and the higher aspirations of humanity, which strives for civilization, beauty, art & meaning. So the Viking invaders are a faceless, dark menace, almost an embodiment of our own darker selves; while both the monks & the survivals of the Fair Folk are the guardians & caretakers of our better selves. In this context, the film is absolutely contemporary!

This is made even more clear by our young protagonist Brendan's encounter with Crom Cruach, as the young monk-to-be descends into the Underworld to confront an ancient, grim, cruel & hungry god of darkness -- in a Jungian sense, confronting the Shadow. And his relationship with the otherworldly Aisling can be seen as his connection with the Anima, his own soul in the guise of a magical female counterpart, linking male & female, pagan & Christian. While Brendan is no stranger to fear, loss & grief, it's obvious that he'll become more of a whole human being over the years than many of us ever manage ourselves.

Still, I don't want to make this sound too weighty or burdened with overt, heavy-handed symbolism. Above all, the film is truly magical, shimmering with a sense of wonder & possibility that transcends the mundane world without ever denying its often overwhelming power & presence. It's a visual delight & has genuine emotional impact. For those of us who aspire to more than the lowest common denominator offered by modern consumer culture, it's a reminder that the things of real value are to be found within ourselves & have no price tag attached.

4079849,4,B0036TGSWG,"This is quite possibly the most beautiful animated film you will ever see in your life. The colours are vibrant, the movement is fluid, the style is unique, and the images it conjures up are unforgettable. It's like watching a dream unfold.

Brandon is a young monk living in the walled Abbey of Kells in 9th century Ireland, under the care of his stern and rather forbidding uncle. All of Abbott Cellach's attention is fixed on constructing a great wall around the perimeter of Kells so as to better keep out the dreaded Vikings who pillage and destroy everything they come across in their search for gold. Brandon has well and truly internalized his uncle's anxieties, for he defends his uncle's decisions in the carefree face of the other monks and shows no interest whatsoever in entering the forest that he occasionally glimpses through a chink in the wall.

But all that changes when Brother Aidan arrives from the Isle of Iona, fleeing Vikings and carrying with him a book of illuminated pages filled with pictures so beautiful they are said to be able to ""turn darkness into light."" Now known as the Book of Kells, this is a real manuscript currently kept on permanent display at the Trinity College Library in Dublin and which is considered Ireland's most precious natural treasure.

Brandon is immediately entranced by the beauty of the book, neglecting his chores in order to help Aidan gather the materials he needs to make paint and continue his great work. Slipping out through the chink in the wall to the forest beyond, Brendan finds a beautiful yet frightening place filled with wolves and spirits: and one little faerie girl called Aisling who decides to help him.

But Abbot Cellach is not sympathetic about Brendan's new interests, especially not with more and more refugees daily flocking to the Abbey as they flee the encroaching Vikings. Terrifying figures that are depicted as brutal and faceless T-shapes with horns and axes, the invaders are unstoppable - and nearing Kells. Meanwhile, Brendan takes it upon himself to venture into the lair of the pagan god Crom Cruach in search of a crystal, a valuable instrument needed in order to better learn his newfound craft.

The story is certainly the weakest aspect of the film, with rather muddled messages about how to deal with the issues that it raises. For instance, the threat of the Vikings is not dealt with in a satisfying way. Abbot Cellach's motto is to build higher and stronger walls in the face of invaders, whilst Brother Aidan urges everyone to run away in the face of evil. As it stands, neither one's methods are particularly effective, yet neither one's choices have much in the way of consequences. The Viking attack on Kells is frightening enough, but when the smoke clears there doesn't seem to be a devastating amount of damage (there are plenty of survivors, and the residents soon rebuild). On the other hand, Aidan and Brandon successfully escape with the book, but their methods result in Cellach believing that his nephew is dead, subjecting him to years of grief before Brendan finally decides to return.

I spent the entire film assuming that Aisling would call up spirit forces to defend the Abbey, whilst Brandon would rely upon his Christian faith in order to defeat Crom Cruach, but neither supposition came to fruition. It felt as though a really lovely balance could have been struck between the Old and New Religions of Ireland, but instead there's an odd disconnection and an anti-climax.

Even stranger is the fact that despite the centrality of the Book of Kells as the story's main McGuffin, the film offers no insight whatsoever into its contents. The film is rife with paganism and spirituality, but Christianity doesn't seem to get much of a voice. The film even goes to all the trouble of establishing that the book has miraculous powers, and yet when it comes into the hands of an indisputable enemy... nothing happens.

It's best just to go with the flow in regards to the plot and enjoy the beautiful animation and charming characters. It's a toss-up between Aisling and Pangur Bn as the film's most beguiling character. Aisling (pronounced ""Ashling"") is a small white spirit who performs gravity-defying backflips and peeks out from behind impossibly long white hair, whilst  Pangur Bn captures the quintessential nature of any cat: curious and self-important, affectionate and conceited, brave and vain. Both are beautifully rendered and share the film's most haunting scene: in trying to free Brandon from his chamber, Aisling uses a magical song to temporarily turn Pangur Bn into a spirit who gently floats through the Abbey and retrieves the key from above the Abbot's bed.

There really aren't enough words to describe how beautiful the film is, and it's so rare these days to see hand-drawn 2-D animation (everyone else having moved to computer animation). In more ways than one, ""The Secret of Kells"" is a lovely look back at a bygone age.",1378684800,,4967,4.895362663495838

4079875,4,B0036TGSWG,"This the best animated film that I have ever watched. Pixar and Disney fans need to forget about the cuteness and the life lessons that characterize these two companies, but this is exactly what makes you remember ""The Secret of Kells"". The animation is inspired by the Book of Kells itself, which reminds me a bit of old school animation, but with a quality that shows and represents current technology. Another highlight of this film is the soundtrack, composed by Bruno Coulais, which helps the movie penetrate your mind and come alive whenever you listen to it.

Brendan is a boy living with the monks at Kells Abbey. Brother Aidan, escaping from the Vikings, arrives one day from the Iona Abbey carrying with him the unfinished ""Book of Iona"". Brother Aidan is concerned about who is going to finish it, for his eyesight is no longer good enough for this task, and because he also needs two things: gall nuts to make ink and the Eye of Collum-Cille. Brendan decides to help, and this leads him into the forest surrounding the Abbey of Kells, which he has been forbidden to visit.

Regardless of how historically accurate this film is, this film should be taken as a legend. Legends are half fantasy and half reality, and there is usually more than one version to it, so why can't this film be another version of the legend of the Book of Kells? I don't know why there are reviewers giving this film a low rating because it's not historically accurate. This film does not pretend to be a documentary; it's simply an animated film. In adition, some reviewers are also giving this movie a low grade because it's mixing pagan and Christian beliefs. The film is set in Ireland and during the Middle Ages, a historic period known for being plagued by Paganism and in a country with strong Celtic beliefs, so I cannot believe there are people making this a problem.

I would have given this film 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that, in order to fully appreciate this film, you need to have some Celtic culture 101 beforehand. I have always been interested in Celtic culture, so I was fascinated the entire time by this film, but people who know little about this topic might have a bit of a rough time feeling hooked by the plot. For instance, if you have no idea about what the Book of Kells is, you might watch the film wondering what the fuss is all about these monks and the book. Sure, it is said in the film that ""this book"" will give hope to people and help them overcome darkness, but, other than that, nothing else.

All in all, a great film that stands out greatly from your regular Disney and Pixar films.",1370649600,,2618,4.5168776371308015

4079891,5,B0036TGSWG,"There are several elements I kept in mind reviewing this movie, so I've split my review into parts.

--Story: 4 stars--

The story, while it doesn't follow a Disney-esque plot line, is not off the beaten path. It is generally well-paced and plotted. The development of Brendan is clear throughout, and the varia of plot elements keeps the story engaging. From the quirky monks of the abbey to the wild denizens of the forest, there are many locations and characters that add to a rich world. The villain (the Northmen) is not overcome in the traditional sense. Rather, the saving of the Book, and to an extent the story within the book and the art of illumination, gives hope to the people. I believe a driving theme is that hope is greater than strength as a saving force.

If I had any qualms about the story line, it would be that the ending flew by a little too quickly. This was the time of some of the most beautiful sequences, and it looked like a series of watercolor paintings--something I really appreciate, being a watercolor artist with a similar style. But I think it left me wanting more scenes showing the hope the Book brought to the people, which I thought was the theme. I know there's only so much you can do with the length of a children's animated feature, but I think it would have left me a greater lingering impression of the importance of the Book in the history of Ireland.

--Characters: 4.5 stars--

Brendan, the main character and protagonist, is a nontraditional hero. His story is a coming-of-age narrative, and he is relatable for anyone curious about the world beyond. Brendan is mentored by the aging Brother Aidan of Iona in the art of illumination, so that the titular Book of Kells may be completed. It's fun to watch Brendan develop from uncertain and timid into convinced and sure about his ability to illuminate and aid in the mission.

I'm quite tempted to have a white cat and name it Pangur Ban, thanks to this movie. Pangur Ban, the white odd-eyed cat of brother Aidan, was quite possibly my favorite character, and called to mind the catlike Toothless of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Train-Your-Dragon/dp/B0047C4KBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Train Your Dragon</a>, in personality and something in face. If you hadn't read in another review already, Pangur Ban is the cat in the poem of an anonymous Irish monk from the same time period. You can read a version online; it's delightful.

Many characters, inspired by lore, weave a tapestry of a world both real and fantastical. Aisling, the fairy guardian of the forest, is named for the Irish form of poetry, and she's likely a reference to the early settlers of Ireland, by that time known as fairies in folklore. Her relationship with Brendan develops from animosity to friendship, and it's very adorable. Another reference to Irish mythology is Crom Cruach, an ancient god, and in the movie a primordial force of evil lurking beneath the earth. It's interesting that although the Crom Cruach is evil and nearly kills Aisling, its eye is the gem that aids Brendan in illuminating 'the book that turns the darkness into light.' Quite a twist, and maybe purposeful--or is it simply a plot MacGuffin? I like to think it's symbolic.

I found it interesting how the Northmen were not really the antagonists in the story, so much as a looming threat. They are foreshadowed by the appearance of ravens (quite appropriate) and are literally hulking black forms with horns and swords. Given that the movie is from the point of view of the Irish, they easily represent the Irish perspective on the invaders. The real antagonist is the Abbot, but he is in no way the villain. Rather, his motives are to save the people and especially his nephew Brendan: quite understandable. In retrospect, I see a similarity in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brave/dp/B008YWY0HK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brave</a>&nbsp;and the relationship between the main character and her mother. Interesting to see how both of the adults in these movies have good motives but the wrong means, and are proven wrong. I wonder what message this conveys to the target audience? Not attempting to moralize, just curious.

--Animation: 5 stars--

This is by far the strongest point of the movie. The movie draws inspiration from many period sources, the first and foremost being the Book of Kells. 2D animation was the right choice, so as to continue the legacy of hand-drawn art, and to imitate the look of the original book. This enriches the beauty of every aspect, from the angles of the abbey to the shapes of the forest. The entire movie is quite literally a moving picture in beautiful nature-inspired colors.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the animation style of the characters harkens to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kim-Possible-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B004AWP3EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kim Possible: The Complete First Season</a>. It took me a while during the movie to pin it down, but there are definitely similarities between the shape and movement of characters in both. At first, it grated on my senses, but then I really began to appreciate how the characters, especially ones like the monks, are built on shapes. It adds to the sense of a world within the very geometric book of Kells.

At times, the illuminated symbols danced to life and floated around, as one reviewer said, like butterflies. I was strongly reminded of the mushi in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mushishi-Box-Set-S-A-V-E/dp/B005HVWWB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mushishi: Box Set S.A.V.E.</a>, ""mushi"" being the Japanese word for bug. Also, when Brendan fought Crom Cruach beneath the earth, I thought of the underground River of Light in Muhsishi. The two share gorgeous nature backdrops that feel like paintings and connections to their respective mythologies. As Mushishi is a contender for my favorite anime, I think The Secret of Kells is a contender for my favorite western animation.

--Overall: 4.5 stars--

The Secret of Kells is a clever movie with a lot of thought and effort put into it. Recommended for fans of beautiful animation, Irish mythology, or a solid children's story.",1362096000,2,6343,5.273538156590684

I was absolutely blow away by the beautiful animation and song that wove the story of the Book of Kells. The use of the medieval style of illumination in the animation was a beautiful touch as a classic tale of Ireland is told.

This fanciful depiction of the looming terror of Viking savagery, and a boy's creative outwitting of crushing limitations put on the monastery's revered calligraphic labor, is sparked with imaginative flights of brushwork and color in every scene.  The mythical assistance of animals and trees, plants and birds shows how these elements were incorporated into the gorgeous illustrations of the real Book of Kells. The film is  a breathtaking riot of visual delight.",1356739200,,694,5.339449541284404

4079909,4,B0036TGSWG,"The Secret of Kells was inspiring, especially as an artist suffering from art-block.  However, i wasn't too pleased with the stream itself.  There were a lot of times that a characters face was nothing more than smeared pixels, and the whole film just seemed grainy.  I'm fairly disappointed that I did not check Hulu first; instead of paying $3.99 to rent it from Amazon, I could have watched it for free, and in much higher quality.

The story is one of adventure too as the young monk sets out to find some berries in the forest for the elder monks to use in their calligraphy.  He encounters a little girl forest sprite who helps him.  The monks have to safeguard their treasures and protect them from invaders too.  It is an enchanting story and well worth the purchase.

The animation is hand-drawn, and well enough done, but would have been extraordinary only 40 years ago. Along with that, there is no reason to own a blu-ray version of this movie. I watched the DVD on a 1080p TV, and it looked as good as it is ever going to look. Up-conversion handles the simple graphics of this film nicely.

The story is simplistic, and largely unrevealing of its two themes (the mysterious power of nature, and the futility of optimistic obsession). It is a bit frightening for very young children, and only mildly interesting for anyone older than that. It short, a movie easily damned by faint praise.",1347494400,2,738,4.6692307692307695

4079930,4,B0036TGSWG,"In the world where Flash cartoons and anime regularly dominate television animation, it's rare that the cartoons themselves are an expression of a European artistic style.  ""The Secret of Kells"" addresses that problem by using the Book of Kells as a template.

Brendan (Evan McGuire) is the young nephew of Abbot Cellach (Brendan Gleeson), who lives in the Christian Abbey of Kells. Cellach is obsessed with the construction of a wall around Kells, the better to keep out the raiding Northmen that destroyed the island monastery of Iona. When Aidan (Mick Lally) the master illuminator arrives with the Book of Iona in hand, their world is upended.  Aidan proves to be a gentle but disruptive influence on Brendan, who is encouraged to venture beyond the walls in search of gall nuts to make ink for the Book.  It is there that Brendan meets Aisling (Christen Mooney), a fey being who takes a liking to the young boy.

""The Secret of Kells"" never really makes a case for why Aisling is so protective of young Brendan, but she is pivotal to the entire tale.  Brendan becomes the champion, protector, and eventually author and artist of what will become the Book of Kells. At every turn, whenever danger rears its head, Aisling is how he gets through it.

Fortunately, ""The Secret of Kells"" is so visually engaging that it's easy to forgive the plot's occasional rigidity. The artwork is nothing short of stunning, bringing an ancient manuscript to life in a variety of animated forms.  It also has some truly breathtaking moments, including a haunting melody about Aidan's stalwart feline companion Pangor Ban.

And that's what elevates ""The Secret of Kells"" above common animated fare. It's filled with hidden nuggets that reward the persistent. Although the details are postulated by Fabrice Ziolkowski all of it is based on what we know of the Book of Kells: the Book is believed to have really journeyed from Iona to Kells, Crom Cruach was really a Celtic pagan deity, and yes Pangor Ban was a real cat with a real poem written about him.

My four-year-old was enthralled and, despite the Northmen being cast as gold-lusting brutes, wasn't bothered by the off-screen violence. Although ""The Secret of Kells"" has its flaws, it makes up for it with an abundance of charm.",1341705600,3,2271,4.860103626943006

It has wonderful elements, besides the beautiful music, most notably the characterization of the wood fairy Aisling who helps Aiden escape the murderous Northmen (my people).  This children's voice acting is just sublime here;  this movie won an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, so I expect nobody actually hated it.

4079934,5,B0036TGSWG,"Anime being all the rage today (as it was 35 years ago, but in the form of ""Kimba"" and ""Speed Racer""), I would have expected a name like Miyazaki to be attached to the latest charming find.  That was not the case with ""The Book of Kells,"" a delightfully imaginative experience whose style and tone evoke some of the Japanese master's work without copying it.  The story -- based loosely on the history of the actual Book of Kells, an illuminated Holy manuscript -- is a sensorial experience that melds both Christian and non-Christian ideals as we follow the exploits of Brandon, an orphan who will become central to its creation.  Though told from the point of view of a child, the story is decidedly adult, and though not explicit, often not quite kid friendly -- again, like many anime features.  But its spirit is aimed at the kid in all of us, from the knowingly familiar tribulations of growing up to the delightful cadre of secondary characters (including the forest spirit, Aisling, and, as a nod to historical accuracy, a diverse range of monks representing many of the great theological artists of the world at that time) to the sly cat Pangur Ban, who is as realistic a feline in temperament as any who has ever graced the screen.  The cast is excellent, though the only voice that may be immediately familiar is the always enjoyable Brendan Gleason.  True, some people may be put off by the mixing of Celtic and other traditions, but this international production (I counted Irish, Belgian, and Turkish while admiring the end credits, but I'm sure there is more) doesn't ask to be viewed as anything but high entertainment.  It succeeds in this admirably.",1336348800,,1667,4.727586206896552
4079935,5,B0036TGSWG,"I've had an interest in Irish and Celtic culture for several years, and this movie is like a love letter to that culture from its people. Directed by Tomm Moore, it is a story about monks, faeries, wolves, vikings, illuminated manuscripts, and terrifying creatures of legend. Watching it is like seeing an illuminated manuscript come to life before your eyes; perspective is an afterthought, letting its characters swing and run through a changing, visually engaging environment. Colourful smoke, shimmers, shapes and shadows move beautifully across the screen; to think this was made in Adobe Flash is absolutely unreal! Bruno Coulais' spirited soundtrack beats the old Celtic drums and plays the pipes with such vibrant energy it almost feels like an extra colour you can't see; the soundtrack is worth picking up on its own, if you can. This was an unexpected nomination for the 2010 Academy Award for Best Animated Film. Featured on the Blu-ray special features is one of the film's characters, a faerie girl named Aisling, giving a short interview about the nomination. She is surprised, but grateful for the recognition. We should be, as well.

As for what the film is about, Brendan is a young monk in the Abbey of Kells, an eager, boisterous young lad that likes to find as much beauty in the world as he can, and faces it with courage and a strong spirit. He lives under his uncle, Abbot Cellach, a stern, disciplined man of God, who has laboured for months to build a huge defensive wall around the Abbey grounds, to defend from the coming Vikings. The walls soar impossibly high in the air, and teams of labourers work tirelessly on the scaffolds to complete it. Soon, a white-haired traveller comes to the abbey, and addresses himself as Brother Aiden of Iona, spoken of in hushed tones by the scribes in the scriptorium. He brings with him the Book of Iona, rumoured to be of such beauty that looking upon it can smite demons and blind the sinful. Brendan's imagination alights with visions of divinely inspired writing when he meets Aiden, and Aiden is a playful, encouraging artist, who believes that Brendan has potential for greatness.

Knowing what a strict influence the Abbot is on young Brendan, he encourages him to find some berries in the nearby woods, to make green ink. Brendan's never been outside the walls before, but he believes he's up to the challenge... at least until he gets lost. He is found by Aisling, a strange girl with piercing green eyes and flowing white hair. She hops and darts around the forest like an animal, and has a harsh yet curious disposition. When Brendan describes the Book of Iona, Aisling is intrigued, and offers to show him where the berries live, while also showing off ""her"" forest. The two soon form a friendship.

From here, big changes start to happen for the characters. Brendan is taught the delicate skill of illustration, Abbot Cellach becomes more and more worried as more and more survivors of the Viking raids seek shelter in Kells, Aisling grows closer with Brendan, and the Book of Iona draws ever closer to completion. Things are complicated by the invasion of the Vikings, however, depicted in this film as faceless black monsters, laying waste and leaving trails of red wherever they go. The characters are pushed to their limits when the Vikings invade, and they must come to grips with what is most important to them. The various scenes throughout the movie are inventive and unexpected, and are well-worth discovering on your own.

This isn't a story strictly ""about"" Irish culture or Irish people, but it creates a backdrop for a very Irish story. Catholic and Celtic symbolism feature throughout the film like a pair of skilled dancers, the entire cast is Irish (aside from the bizarrely out-of-place Chinese, Italian, African and English comic-relief monks), and much of the art style draws from insular art. For the Celtic enthusiast, there are neat little historical touches; the Abbey of Kells was a real place with a tall tower in the centre, Iona is a real island you can visit, and at one point, Brendan faces off against the Crom Cruach, a pre-Christian deity that demanded human sacrifice. Smaller touches include Aiden's cat, Pangur Bn, named after an ancient Irish poem about a monk's pet cat, and Aisling (Irish for ""dream"") is named for a form of Irish poetry, where a white spectral woman comes to someone and gives them a vision. If you love Irish culture, there's a lot to please you. If you've never really cared, you will after this movie.

As for the technical details of the Blu-ray, it is an excellent production. The packaging features the iconic image of Aisling's face staring out from the woods, but it smacks a bit of ten-minutes-in-Quark-Express, repeatedly mentioning its Academy Award nomination, and the box has an annoying little latch that I keep forgetting to open, but as for the contents, they are excellent. A small booklet is included with a lavishly illustrated prequel comic, called ""The Secret of Kells: Origins"", detailing the backstory of Aisling and Brendan, and the fates of their families. For being such a short comic, it fleshes out the movie's protagonists very well.

The Blu-ray features a number of special features, including a commentary from the director, producer, and art director, videos from the voice recording sessions, and featurettes about the making of the film. As for the movie itself, it looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous! Watching it on a 1080p television, the colours absolutely explode with beauty, and it has a crisp, superb 5.1-channel DTS-HD sound mix, delicate with its ambience and subtle voicework, yet intense and full of life during the film's more thrilling scenes. The DVD is no slouch, either, featuring the same 5.1 audio mix, as well as a 2.0 mix for more basic systems, but not quite as many special features. This is a movie that absolutely begs for the best possible viewing experience.

To put it short, this is a beautiful and unique animated film, rising to the occasion on Blu-ray and DVD. The movie's probably on Netflix and Amazon Instant, but having seen it on both, I can assure you you want the full, uncompromised HD presentation for this movie. This is a worthy addition to any Blu-ray shelf for any viewer that likes a bit of fun, beauty, and heart in their movie collection, and at this price, you won't regret it.",1336262400,,6397,4.863302752293578
4079936,5,B0036TGSWG,"<strong>The Secret of Kells</strong> (Tomm Moore, 2009)

It has been a long time--five months, in fact--since I watched the superlative <em>The Secret of Kells</em>, an exceptionally strong film that came out in an exceptionally strong year for animation. I had to let it sit this long before I could come up with anything reasonable to say about it (in other words, any review where every third word would not have been some variation of ""awesome!""). I'm still not quite convinced I'm capable of it; I can think of only one (three if you count Jan Svankmajer's stop-motion masterpieces) fully-animated film I've ever seen that's better than <em>The Secret of Kells</em> (that being <em>Hotaru no Haka</em>).

Based (very) loosely on folktales surrounding the creation of the Book of Kells, an Irish retelling of the four Gospels, the film (whose artwork is also based on the Book's illustrations) centers on Brendan (Evan McGuire), a spunky young apprentice living in a remote Irish abbey presided over by his uncle, the dour Cellach (Brandan Gleeson). All is relatively well, or as well as it can be, until Brother Aidan (Mick Lally), a legendary illustrator who takes Brendan under his wing, arrives. Worse yet, while on an errand for Aidan (which Cellach has strictly forbidden Brendan to undertake), Brendan meets Aisling (Christen Mooney), a local supernatural being (one hesitates to use the term ""fairy"", even if it is here in its most classical sense) who strengthens Aidan's message that there is, in fact, more to life than Cellach's obsession with building a wall around the town strong enough to withstand the Vikings. All well and good, until the Vikings approach...

While there are certain scenes (most of which involve said Vikings) that will probably be a bit on the intense side for younger viewers, and others will take (and have taken) offence to the movie's overtly pro-Christian overtones, I had neither problem with the film (and I am speaking as an avowed atheist with an infant son, who was riveted to the screen most of the time). I was, in short, bowled over by it, despite knowing very little about the Book of Kells before sitting down to watch this. The animation is top-notch, and stylized to the point where one marvels that it came out of the Disney studios. But then, there is so little Disney about this movie I'm just assuming that the Disney Ireland folks ignored any directives from Hollywood and went their own way on this. A good idea that was, indeed, if it happened. There is a distinct lack of princesses, a fine absence of talking animals (thought there is a trademark anthropomorphic cat, Pangur Ban--but he, too, is lifted from Celtic tradition, rather than being smacked into the story wholesale a la the lovely, if out-of-place, police horse in <em>Tangled</em>), and, well, far too much complexity, storywise (and emotions-wise), for your average Disney movie. It's  an amazing piece of work, and if you're unfamiliar with the backstory, just sit back and let the incredible animation wash over you. This is pretty much everything an animated movie <em>should</em> be. **** ",1335484800,2,3124,5.0

I've always loved celtic art, and the animators here created a gorgeous world of layered designs with delicious color. I was so taken with the look of the film that I had to watch it again to catch the story. The characters are rich, and there are moments of humor without any of the pretension of Disney-type dialogues. The voice actors, including the two main children, are believable and genuine. The line between fact and imagination (or between material and spiritual worlds) is blurred in the story, which makes for an interesting take on the origin of the illuminated manuscript, the Book of Kells. On top of all the visual wonder is the excellent soundtrack, executed in part by the band Kila. I'm a huge fan of this movie - glad that the DVD was finally released, at least a year after its nomination at the Oscars. And a word to parents, there are scenes that may be difficult for younger children, such as a Viking raid on the monastery, and a confrontation with a dark spirit in the forest. But the feeling of wonder in the film is infectious for children of all ages. Get this movie!",1310947200,,1161,4.507109004739337
4079957,5,B0036TGSWG,"Set in the time of the world when Vikings still roamed the series and burned villages and destroyed lives.  Brendan has been raised in the monastery by his uncle Abbot Cellach, who is somewhat stern though he does love his nephew even if he doesn't know how to show it.  Brendan is a typical young boy of the age, curious and eager to help the monks with their work, illustrating and copying manuscripts.  One day Brother Aidan, acknowledged as the greatest illustrator of the age arrives and Brendan is captivated.  He wants to help and discovers he has the power to be an even better illustrator than Aidan.  On his journey Adian meets Aisling, an ancient wood fairy, and does battle with a pagan god.

The Book of Kells is one of the most beautifully illustrated books ever produced...and this movie is one of the most beautifully animated films I've ever seen.  It imagines who might have created the book and brings them to life in a beautiful story. You can't help, but watch the film and instantly feel as if you're transported back in time to when the vikings were terrorizing hamlets and villages, and when books were not mass produced but painstakingly copied page by page and the illustrations for the book uniquely produced creating vivid imagery around the words on the page.  And the animation that makes this film is unique with brilliantly produced colors that capture the sense of wonder that people must have felt when they saw the original Book of Kells.  This is an absolutely beautiful film and one that can be enjoyed time after time.",1308960000,,1556,4.6911764705882355

The movie's latter half is rushed

One should see this movie simply because this level of detail in such an original style of animation may never be seen again.

4079977,5,B0036TGSWG,"Nobody holds the geniuses at Pixar in higher esteem than I do.  Those talented artists have reduced me to blubbering jelly and made me laugh hysterically more times than I can count - I am getting misty right now just thinking of Sarah MacLachlan's ""When She Loved Me"" from ""Toy Story 2,"" and don't get me started on the money-jar montage of ""Up.""  And if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, other studios seem to pay Pixar compliments every other week as another big studio cranks out a computer-generated animated flick, desperate to become the next Pixar.

But by gum there are other animators out there whose movies need to be watched, and Tomm Moore is one of them.  Moore, who wrote and co-directed ""The Secret of Kells,"" understands that at the heart of every great movie is a great story.  ""SoK"" is a classic.  It's the Dark Ages, and the Vikings are running amok.  (Rendered here in horrifying black minimalist style, the Vikings have never looked so cartoonish or so evil.)  All of Ireland is aflame or terrified they will be next.

Monastaries are a bastion of light and education during these dark times.  The monastary at Kells is ruled by the iron-yet-caring hand of Abbott Cellach (Brendan Gleeson), who seeks to protect the monastary by building a terrifying wall.  But the monks are also illuminating manuscripts - recording the Bible in some of the most beautiful pages ever created - while the rest of the world burns.  Indeed, the famed illuminator Aidan, a fugitive from Iona, arrives at Kells and continues his life's work of recording the Gospels.  To do this, he enlists the help of Brendan, the youngest and most daring monk in Ireland.

What does he need Brendan for?  In the dark, sinister forest, a humble berry grows that is essential to the creation of the ink needed to illuminate the manuscripts.  And so it is that Brendan ventures into the forest to seek the berries, and this is where the adventure becomes magical.

Suffice it to say that Brendan meets a girl in the forest who is ever so much more than she seems.  In the face of a Viking invasion, these two forge a magical, timeless relationship that will delight and enchant.

This is a complex, grown-up story that kids get right away because it is so fundamental.  Everyone also clues into what's going on thanks to the amazing animation, which is as flat and two-dimensional as you can get.  This is powerful, subtle art, and it perfectly matches both the harsh life in the monastary and the wondrous enchantment that is the forest (not to mention the dark power of the Viking invasion).

While this movie does not come stamped with a big studio name, this movie proudly takes its seat at the table of Great Animated Movies of the past decade.  Check it out.",1296172800,3,2760,4.6687370600414075

It's a unique, family-friendly fantasy based on traditional Irish folk tales surrounding the origins of an illuminated manuscript from the 9th Century called The Book of Kells (an actual historical artifact, kept on permanent display at Dublin's Trinity College). There are Tolkienesque touches (a diminutive hero, forest elves, marauding invaders), but this is one classic ""quest"" tale with a refreshing twist-the goal is not power or defeat of a villain, but rather the preservation of knowledge and illumination. For the amazingly vivid look of their film, Tomm Moore and Nora Twomey, through some kind of ""secret"" alchemy of their own, seem to have taken some of those marvelous medieval era woodcuts and paintings you see in museums and art books and brought them to life.",1294358400,4,1045,4.909604519774011

I had to watch it 4 times to be able to take it all in and not lose myself and lose the story.  The young protagonist leads you through a world of adventure, discovery, magic, loss, and redemption as he strives to live his dreams of illuminating and sharing the books of the Abbey in a time frought with real threats such as wolves in the forest and invading Vikings.  A great story of perseverance in the face of adversity for everyone and great fantasy for the kids woven into wonderfully complex and spellbinding artwork.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

Images, voices and music all added up to one charming film. A great antidote to the fast-paced, action-oriented cartoons -- the tempo was slower than we are accustomed to in most movies, but the visuals constantly but gently captivate our attention as we follow the boy in the story into the woods surrounding the abbey which is drawn in a way that echoes the illustrations in the Book of Kells. The overall theme is of the value of committing oneself to a work that is larger than life. Fabulous and in my opinion, good for all ages, although there is a scene of animated violence when the northern soldiers attack but it is told essentially through art and music, in a way that is emotionally moving, not gratuitous.",1293926400,,888,4.591194968553459

I think you will with this beautiful sweet movie.",1293321600,,504,4.456521739130435

4079991,4,B0036TGSWG,"This is the story of a young boy named Brendan who lives with him uncle who is the head of the monastery, Kells. They are living in a time where invaders are pillaging and killing small villages and Brendan's uncle is obsessed with building a wall he thinks will keep them out. He has forbidden Brendan from ever travelling outside of the walls. Then another monk, brother Aiden, comes to Kells and he is the holder of a book that has the most amazing illuminations in it. The book is supposed to change with life of anyone who reads it, but it isn't finished yet. Brendan's uncle has also forbade Brendan and the other monks from doing any illumination because he wanted everyone to be as consumed with the building of the wall as he was. When brother Aiden came however, he inspired Brendan to want to see his illuminations. Aiden sent Brendan into the forest to find berries he needed to make ink, and he went. This was Brendan's first rebellions against his uncle and he was very nervous and got lost in the forest. There he meets a wolf who turns into a girl, named Ashley. She's a fairy and befriends and helps Brendan. On the way back to the monastery they come across an evil presence which we deal with later. So Brendan studies illumination under the tutelage of Aiden and things are progressing quite well until Aiden realized he lost a glass that helps him do the most intricate work, and the name of the glass shares the name of the evil presence Brendan and Ashley passed in the forest. So Brendan takes it upon himself to fight this beast for the sake of the book that will change the world.

This film is a visual masterpiece. Everything is geometrical. At first glance the animation looks juvenile and simple, but the scenes are so well laid out and intricate. The characters are very geometrical in nature, and when they run in a group they form a single shape. The cracks or shapes in between objects or objects themselves are all patterned.

One flaw I found in the film was that the monks were all of different nationalities and the portrayal of their different nationalities was really racist, almost offensively so. They weren't a large part of the film though, so it didn't bother me as much as they would have if they'd played a larger role.",1292371200,7,2266,4.524390243902439
4079992,5,B0036TGSWG,"""The Secret Of Kells""
(Flatiron Films, 2010)
-----------------------------------
This is a gorgeous, innovative and delightfully meaningful film, a fictionalized account of the making of the legendary Book Of Kells, one of the great surviving illuminated manuscripts of medieval Ireland.  The visual imagery is amazing, packed with stunning composition and color, and imaginative direction. The pace of the film is a bit odd - deliberate in places, jumpy in others - and that, along with the deep, mystical fascination with nature and spirituality, reminded me of the work of Japanese anime master Hayao Miyazaki, just with a clearer historical perspective. Those who revere creative storytelling and animation will find a lot to love here, as will those who value historical awareness, knowledge and scholarship.  A wonderful, magical movie.

4079993,5,B0036TGSWG,"Granted, getting nominated for an Oscar is practically a miracle for a last minute entry that only showed in two theaters for a week. But that this GEM actually LOST to ""Up"" is mind-numbing. The handling of Celtic Art is wonderful.",1291248000,3,231,4.658536585365853

4079995,4,B0036TGSWG,"This surprise nominee at the Oscars is certainly unique; classic artwork from the 8th Century, when the Vikings invaded Ireland, exists at Trinity Abbey. A film applauding these artworks is long overdue, as well as the history, and The Secret of Kells is a noble endeavor. To supplement the idea, the filmmakers have created a lovely tapestry of a child trying to find out what's going on during these turbulent times. Being a kid (the wonderful Evan McGuire), he defies any adult orders, like most kids, and goes into the forest where he meets a sprite (the wonderful Christen Mooney), who shows him life as it might be if he doesn't take charge. The hero in making is up against lots of odds, and without blabbing away the plot, history remains as it is;  the Irish people persevere. Some great voice-perfs from Brendan Gleeson and Mike Lolly, and the film survives as a curiousity. Maybe a little too esoteric in it's approach (read: slow), the angst of the approaching Vikings wasn't frightening enough. Frightening, yes...but not enough.",1290729600,3,1042,4.887005649717514
4079996,5,B0036TGSWG,"The Secret of Kells is THE most beautifully animated film I have seen. The visuals alone, from the cold misty forests, to the lush green treetops, had me mesmerized. This is bold, artsy storytelling. All the scenes are beautifully drawn, with a few key scenes drawn in radically different styles. I don't want to spoil the plot, but look for the underwater battle scene. The style in that scene was unlike anything I've seen in an animated film.

I watched this with my kid sister, and she lost interest towards the middle. This movie is just different than other ones you've seen. There aren't a bunch of childish antics or needless action to try to keep kids with short attention spans interested. The action builds, like a good novel. This movie would be great for kids who are older, or more mature for their age.

If you have a kid who's thinking about animation as a career, or is just interested in animation in general and how these movies are made, buy this movie. There are several special features about the animation process, and this is cutting-edge, top-quality animation.

If you know someone who's interested in Irish or Gaelic mythology, buy this movie.

If you know someone who is artistically inclined, buy this movie. (Especially if they are interested in illuminated manuscripts.)

If you're a Christian, buy this movie. The whole story is about a young boy who wants to share ""The Book"" with the whole world. ""The Book"" is of course the Bible, whose message can turn ""darkness into light.""

Or if you're just someone who's interested in seeing a good story full of gorgeous, vivid imagery, buy this movie. At times, I was frightened, I was near tears, my heart was filled with joy. You can tell the animators' heart and soul went into this project.

4079997,5,B0036TGSWG,"It's heart-warming to know that the British Isles can produce - in Tomm Moore - an animator with a vision that is undoubtedly set to rival the great Miyazaki.  Amazingly, this stunning independent film was made for a mere 5 million - the catering bill for a modest Hollywood film - and was completely hand-drawn.  Which doesn't mean it's crude or sketchy.  It's as polished as a Ghibli or Pixar film.  Every scene looks fabulous, and the film has audio and music to match.  Yet surprisingly, even when it first opened in Ireland, the box-office was low and the film struggled with its American cinema distribution.  Why?  A few jaded early reviews probably didn't help - I vaguely remember reading gripes about the 'weak' plot, and other niggles, that put me off the film.  How wrong they were, as the Oscar nomination proved.  The story is fine, and the characters are well-delineated and engaging.  The dialogue is crisp, well delivered, and the story moves along briskly. While the film's visual panache will undoubtedly appeal to (and possibly frighten) 6-8 year olds, it's probably older intelligent children in the 9-12 range who will enjoy it the most - and possibly all the more after a look at the real Book of Kells in the online facsimile, and a read of the famous short cat-poem ""Pangur Ban"".  The DVD extras include two short 'making of' featurettes, and an apparently (I never listen to them) rather dry audio commentary.  Overall, a gem.",1290211200,,1452,4.78714859437751
4079998,5,B0036TGSWG,"I hope its enough to say that this story is captivating, the animation images are marvelous, the music is brilliant, the low-key characterizations by the actors are charmingly Irish. The film depicts parallel themes central to much Irish lore; the abject terror from the brutal Viking invaders, and the brilliance of the Irish monks who preserved much of Western Civilization in gorgeous and stunningly intricate illuminated manuscripts while Europe was locked in the Dark Ages. It's not a religious story; its a blending of history and legend. It's got some dark and scary imagery, but its part of the story and not overdone.

It's missing two things, though, that American kids may not know; that the Book of Kells is real and displayed in Dublin today, and that Ireland is still dotted with the tall round towers built to provide refuge from the brutal Northmen. So before you play this film for the kids, download a hi-res photo of the actual Chi-Rho page from the real Book of Kells, and of an Irish round tower, and explain them to the kids when its over.",1290124800,4,1061,4.766304347826087
4079999,4,B0036TGSWG,"The SECRET OF KELLS is an offbeat animated fantasy that takes as its inspiration the Celtic Book of Kells , created during the medieval period. The story is set in a monastery during the early Middle Ages when Vikings were a threat; it is a mixture of history and fantasy and is moderately interesting for an adult audience but I suspect it wouldn't hold the attention of youngsters under 12. The genius of the film lies in its imaginative animation technique and in its clever way of using design elements from the book of Kells to tell its story. It succeeds in this to such an extent that the film was nominated for an Academy Award for best animated feature in 2009.

I bought this film mostly because the artwork seemed unusual and I was exploring animation styles for a project I'm working on. The plot, while interesting is rather predictable and not very challenging. It also seems a bit rushed at the end where the boy suddenly grows up and brings the book back to the Monks. As someone else mentioned it is short, but then most animated features are. That didn't matter as much to me because I actually enjoyed the artwork more than the film. The idea of animating the symbols in the Book of Kells was exciting and I wished it would have played a larger part in the plot of the film. The short sequels where the symbols come to life are magical and belie its strong link to the natural elements surrounding the monks who created the Book.

Movie:  4.5/5, Video Quality:  5/5, Sound Quality:  5/5, Extras:  3/5, Overall:  4.3/5 (rounded down in total star ranking)

Quality:
As near as I can tell, it looks and sounds darn near perfect!

Extras:
This film includes a handful of neat extras (commentary, a couple of featurettes, storyboards, trailers).  A DVD copy of the movie is included as a separate disc.

Film:
This film is about as much essential viewing as a Disney, Pixar, or Hayao Miyazaki film.  That is to say ""The Secret of Kells"" is quite a good story with quality production.  It is a fairly simple story, but it is relatively fresh and hardly predictable, especially with its inclusion of Celtic myth and settings.

Animation quality is strong, and very stylish (characters appear simplistically blocky, whereas the backgrounds are very intricately detailed and use a lot of interesting geometry).  Voice acting and music are great.  Some content may be a bit dark and intense for young children, but is not too graphic or anything.  Altogether, it's well worthwhile seeing.

Packaging:
A standard two-disc case with a slipcover.  A small booklet was included in my copy, containing a stylish graphic novel.",1288051200,,1196,5.082474226804123

The subject of the movie is what intrigued me in the first place. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it. I was moved by the beauty of the animation and the simplicity in the dialogue and the story.  This truly is a beautiful film.  The way the art of the original book is used in the animation style of the film is elegant and well done.  Pangurban is my favorite character.  Then again, I do love cats so i am biased.  Aisling's song is simple and yet sticks with you long after she sings it.  My kids are still too young to see it but it is definitely one I plan on sharing with them when they are older.  If you're looking for something that is beautiful in its simplicity and still tells a great story that captures your imaginaion then I would highly recommend this film.",1287964800,3,942,4.3428571428571425
4080008,4,B0036TGSWG,"When I saw the previews for ""The Secret Of Kells,"" it looked to be a fascinating little piece of work, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Now, after having seen it, I am not as inspired as I had hoped. While the animation was certainly very different and the color palette quite amazing, it wasn't as breathtaking as the folks who nominated it for an Oscar would have you believe. True, while it was very colorful, it still wasn't comparable to old-time Disney animation. I'm sure the point, though, is that it wasn't supposed to be. And that is why no stars have been taken away for that reason in this review. It was clear throughout the viewing that this little film out of Ireland was created with lots of love and tender care, and that is most likely why the majority of reviewers here on Amazon are giving it five stars. But don't forget, it didn't WIN the Oscar. ""The Secret Of Kells"" has a touching story, a morally defined story, a story built upon a foundation of teaching with the intent to make sure the watcher learns said teachings. Starting out with five stars, the story presentation is where I take the first star away...

<SPOILER> The story, while made up of all the components I just mentioned, was a bit flawed in that it wasn't engrossing to any extent. With the kaleidoscopic and varied application of animation, it could have carried that all-encompassing factor flawlessly had it been expanded upon more AFTER the Northmen tried to take over the city of Kells. But instead, we jump instantly to many years in the future. This, to me, took away from the MAIN part of the story, which should have followed with Brendan's growing up years, the expansion of the Book of Kells at his hand of artistic prowess, his relationship with and tutorship from Brother Aidan, and his eventual reunion with his uncle, Abbot Cellach, who thought him to be dead. At only 75 minutes, another ten or fifteen minutes to capture this important part of Brendan's life wouldn't have hurt the film at all, in fact, it would have made it much, much better. A major fault was that Brendan and his uncle were somehow separated after the war so quickly and inexplicably, that I had to rewind the movie to see how it happened and then still couldn't figure it out. This was also about the point where the music abruptly stopped and the screen went black for a solid three seconds. One wonders how the editor didn't catch this huge, gaping mistake...and it is clearly an editing mistake. So it seems that there was more to the story at one time (probably the most important part) that ended up on the floor of the editing room.

I also had a problem with Brendan's continual defiance of his uncle's rules when Brendan was still in his youth. This is where star number two was removed. I really don't want my children watching or reading a story where everything eventually turns out to be okay each and every time the child disobeys his elder. I'm sorry, but at Brendan's age, rules are NOT made to be broken, and additionally, with the defiance and disrespect for adults that is plaguing the world's youth these days, it is simply not a good message to be sending out to the young masses. True, Brendan was scolded for his actions, but he was still aided by another adult to defy his uncle yet again after the fact. Granted, the story wouldn't have held much levity at all if Brendan did everything he was told, but it's a no-brainer that it could have been written in such a way that blatant disrespect wasn't the very basis upon which the meat of the storyline was made possible. <SPOILER END>

All in all, a slightly above average movie, probably a bit overrated, and not anywhere near being comparable to ""Up"" or ""How To Train Your Dragon"" as far as story, and close, but still not in the same boat, as ""Snow White"" or ""Cinderella"" in terms of animation-style and complexity. One more note, and this in a positive sense...the music score by Bruno Coulais was exceptional, captivating, expansive, and quite fascinating!",1287964800,20,4025,4.579750346740638
4080009,5,B0036TGSWG,"I love this movie. The Secret of Kells is now one of my favorite animated movies of all time due to the details, color, story, and information. I liked the little girl with long white hair. She was adorable and powerful. When I first watched her in action, I was easily impressed and I felt like watching these two movies all over again: Spirited Away and Castle in the Sky. The girl was great, and her wolf friends were incredible and frightening. This movie may not be long, but it had a grand story and it looked like it took great timing.

I love the animation and how the scenes capture the flow of the movie. The colors of tragedy, beauty, and imagination astounded me and I could not resist. It has been a while since a movie like this one really interested me such as Avatar, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Toy Story 3, and many others. I love how the movie begins and how the movie ends with a great heartwarming momment. This is a grand animated movie to behold and it is now in my top favorite animated films for life. I will remember this movie as a great achievement even though UP won for Best Animated Picture for the Academy Awards. I do like many of Pixar's works, but we need to give other animated movies a chance to be successful. For example, Spirited Away competed against Monsters Inc. and won for Best Animated movie in the Academy Awards. I still like 2-D animated movies a lot and I think they are still astounding whether they have 3-D animated elements, or not.

I am glad I was able to see this film. This, along with Avatar (James Cameron's film), The Princess and the Frog, A Christmas Carol (with Jim Carrey), and District 9, is one of my favorite movies of 2009. Yeeeaaaah! Good job movie makers of The Secret of Kells!

4080013,5,B0036TGSWG,"he Secret of Kells is an Irish animated film that premiered to rave reviews and was nominated for Best Animated Picture at the 2010 Academy Awards. (It lost to Pixar's Up). Does it really deserve all that praise and hype? I myself was a bit skeptical, but after hearing nothing but good things, I decided to give it a go. The answer is yes. Yes, it really deserve all that praise. It really is that good.

The story takes place in Kells, an abbey in Ireland. This abbey, led by Abbot Cellach, is building a large wall to keep the barbaric Vikings out. His nephew, Brendan, works in the scriptorium as an apprentice. Brendan hears stories of, and eventually meets, Aidan of Iona (and his cat Pangur Bn), a master illuminator who's working on The Book of Iona (eventually called The Book of Kells), a beautifully illustrated Bible that will bring light and hope to the world. Aiden befriends Brendan and begins to teach him the ways of a master illuminator. Abbot Cellach disapproves of Brendan spending his time this way when he should be helping to build the wall. Brendon disobeys his uncle's orders and goes outside of the walls to get berries for Aiden to make ink. While in the forest he meets an adorable wolf-girl-spirit-thing named Aisling and the two become friends. All the while, the Vikings are getting closer to the Abbey.

First off, The Secret of Kells is one of the most stunningly beautiful films I have ever seen. The makers had a relatively low budget of $9 million (as opposed to The Princess and the Frog's $105 million budget) and instead of trying to overextend themselves and have complicated designs and choppy animation, they used a relatively simple yet gorgeous heavily stylized animation style, much like Samurai Jack or Spectacular Spider-Man. (At one point early on in the film, when various characters are telling over a story it becomes even more stylized.) The results are fantastic. Then animation is especially enjoyable when it comes to Aisling--she moves like some sort of graceful animal and her hair flows with her in a way that is wonderful to watch. As for the backgrounds, well, they're quite beautiful as well. The colors are fantastically vivid, especially the forest scenes. Kells also uses perspective in a rather stylized manner that's reminiscent of Richard William's The Thief and the Cobbler, except that the backgrounds are made up of more than just checkerboards. The Secret of Kells is a visual treat, and worth seeing just for that aspect alone.

The movie is far from perfect, though it's not often you can complain that a movie is too short (75 minutes) rather than being too long. This wouldn't be a problem if the ending didn't feel a little rushed and incomplete, but I guess that can be blamed on the budget. It also pretty much assumes you know I have a decent knowledge of Irish lore. I had to look up who Crom Cruach was. (He's a pre-Christian Irish deity.) Heck, they don't even mention that The Book of Kells is a Bible, though that's pretty important when it comes to explaining why it's so important and will give hope to the people. But don't let these two problems stop you from seeing the film. It's enjoyable despite these gaps.

The DVD also comes with a surprisingly decent number of special features. First off is a decent audio commentary that's informative, but does get a little boring in a few places. There's also an entertaining video showing the voice recording process, though it runs on a tad too long. Pencil-to-Picture is a few scenes from the film shown side-by-side with the storyboards/pencil tests. The Directors Presentation is a behind-the-scenes slide show with the director's commentary. The Early Concept Trailer shows what the film could've been; it's interesting, though I'm glad they decided to use a different animation style in the final film. It also includes a director's commentary. Aisling at the Oscars is a seventeen-second animated clip of Aisling made especially for the Oscars (though the audio seems fairly poor for some reason). Finally, the US theatrical trailer is included as well. Considering the amount of special features the past few titles I reviewed had, these were all a real treat.

The Secret of Kells is a phenomenal film, not just because it is visually beautiful, but because it feels like no other animated film I've ever seen. Had it not been going up against Pixar's Up it very well could've won Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards. It's unique, and in a good way. As I said earlier, it's worth seeing this film even if you don't like the story, just to witness a visual masterpiece. I wish I'd have been able to review the Blu-ray.",1287273600,3,4668,4.7794299876084265

The backgrounds are amazing. I also love the incorporation of the style of illuminated manuscripts into the animation. The story is also excellent. Though I read some reviews in the US that people enjoyed the animation, but not the story. I think this is due to the story was written for an Irish audience, so there is little explanation about the Norse invasion and the history of illuminated manuscripts. I watched this movie again with a friend recently, and gave her some background before hand. She said after the movie she was glad to know it. Wikipedia has a pretty good entry about the Book of Kells, so that is a place to start. Again, the movie is visually stunning and is worth seeing for that alone.",1286928000,,864,4.690789473684211
4080016,5,B0036TGSWG,"In trying times, men often look to their faith to guide their actions. It's cathartic. Seeking strength of will from a higher power instills in them a sense of purpose. They fill their lives with prayer and contemplation, writing and reading books of and by holy men on sacred subjects. In becoming so enamored with faith in a potentially real, yet infinitely abstract concept of a religious God, they can often forget the very real and apparent power of nature, and how it provides for us in ways we have yet to appreciate. The Secret of Kells is a story about passing the torch, about Pagan gods nurturing mankind in its sophomoric entry into abstract thinking and faith in the unknown.

The plot follows the monastic Abbey of Kells in Ireland, beset by the inevitable raid of the North Men (or Vikings.) Brendan, the young nephew of Kells' Abbot, becomes enamored by the tale of the Book of Iona, convinced that it contains a holy power, as if the pages were written by Angels. When a twist of fate brings the book and its author, Brother Aidan, to Kells, events are set in motion that spring Brendan into a great adventure and search for enlightenment. The Abbot concerns himself only with building a large wall around the Abbey, to protect it from the Vikings and the outside world. Brendan's determination to aid in the book's creation brings him at odds with his uncle's single-minded goal.

It's in the forests outside the wall that Brendan encounters a forest spirit in the form of a pale young girl who calls herself Aisling. Charged with retrieving berries that would produce a special ink for the book, Brendan and Aisling scour the forest and encounter its wonders on the way to pick them. She saves his life a few times, helps him climb a huge oak tree and pick the berries without being stung by hornets. She guides him back to Kells, but not before they briefly stumble into the lair of the Dark One. Insisting that she cannot go there, and that all of her kind have been taken by the Dark One, they barely escape the creeping darkness before finally arriving home.

Through repeated visits to the forest, and his training as a writer, Brendan slowly begins his transition to an inspired and enlightened individual. At multiple points in the story, Aisling provides for him, accompanies him and outright saves his life with real magic, but all throughout Brendan remains enamored with the power of the Book, which has never manifested any power except that of his own imagination. She doesn't quite understand, but Aisling recognizes this and encourages his endeavors, even to the point where she will go back with him to the lair of the Dark One so that he may retrieve an artifact that will apparently provide him the inspiration needed to finish the book.

Though I won't spoil the rest of the plot, it's important to point out that the movie illustrates these things in both abstract and concrete ways. Whenever Aisling does something, it's always a concrete, real occurence. From turning into a wolf, using magic to retrieve a key and flipping through the trees with grace and ease, the plot is always dependent on her doing impossible but real things. Whenever it comes to the book, or anything involving divine providence, it's always represented in an abstract way that could be real or just a metaphor. This is not done by accident. The movie is illustrating a point that nature, and by proxy Pagan beliefs is rooted in the power of reality. Nature provides, nature is pervasive and ever-present. We are born of the earth just as we claim to be born of an unseen divine force, a force that we struggle to understand or even accept as real. The book never does anything obvious. The faith with which it was created and protected was never overtly satisfied. The only reason it could be finished was because of Aisling's direct intervention. Yet she understands that mankind is thirsting for its identity as abstract beings, struggling against the darkness of the human condition to find meaning where it ISN'T obvious or pervasive. This is the one thing she can't do (she can't enter the lair of the ""Dark One,"") but she will help us survive long enough to ponder it. Brendan comes to know this whereas the Abbot of Kells and his wall represents a misunderstanding of faith as a sanctuary that must be defended against the material world.

The Secret of Kells comes highly recommended, not just for its beautiful animation and attractive art design, Celtic flavored score or the accomplished voice work. It's needed nourishment for the part of us that we tend to forget sometimes.",1286928000,,4604,4.742821473158552
4080017,5,B0036TGSWG,"I knew I wanted to see this movie the first time I saw the trailer.  Sadly I missed its limited showing in the area, but put this on my must have list for home watching.  First off, the blu-ray version is spectacular.  The review on hidef digest gets into the details, but if you have a HD system the detail in this rendition is incredible.  Now for the movie.  It's amazing to see that hand-drawn animation still has a place, if only because it lends a depth and style to the art.  There are CG elements in the Secret of Kells but they merge well into the rest of the movie, as opposed to feeling tacked on or out of place.

The director wanted to do a story that both referenced gaelic myth and history as well as the artistic significance of the book of kells.  The film does a fine job of evoking both the ancient myths of the Tuatha and the art of the illumination.  It's mostly a family movie, although the middle act conclusion might be a bit dark for smaller kids.  As a story it mostly holds together.  On the shorter side of things, I at first thought the third act dipped a bit, but upon further thought I realize that it was intentionally done so.  The theme here is less about good triumphing over light and more about persevering and trying to hold onto to the things that matter.

With the amazing art and music to match, it was an enthralling experience.  I highly recommend it.",1286841600,5,1394,4.291187739463601
4080018,5,B0036TGSWG,"My kindergartener was sick today and did not go to school and as I scrolled through the children's movies on a movie rental website we subscribe to, I found ""The Secret of Kells"". Having never heard anything about this movie but liking the description, we both settled down in the couch to watch it. We were mesmerized from beginning till the end. A perfect blend of history and folklore, this is a high quality production that is well-deserving of the Oscar nomination it received this year (I checked the movie out after viewing it, wondering why it never got wide publicity).

The story begins in the Abbey of Kells, circa 9th century. The Abbot is intent on building a strong wall that would protect the abbey from marauding Vikings. He is strict with his nephew Brendan and is disappointed when the boy seems more interested in more scholarly pursuits. Brendan gets apprenticed to a master illuminator, Aidan of Iona, who along with his feline companion, Pangur Ban, comes to the Abbey after the Vikings destroy his abbey. Aidan is working on the Book of Kells, but since his own eyesight is failing him and his hands are not as steady as they were, he calls on Brendan to help him. Young Brendan is more than eager, finding himself entranced by the beauty of the artwork, and this passion causes him to defy his own uncle's strict orders not to venture out of the abbey. Brendan goes into the nearby woods looking for plants to make into ink. Here, Brendan meets and befriends Aisling, who turns out to be a sort of forest sprite. The rest of the story revolves around Brendan's exploits in order to complete The Book of Kells.

The animation is pure magic, it was like seeing the pages of an illuminated manuscript come to life (ok, maybe an extremely well-illustrated graphic novel, but you get my meaning). Each frame is so beautiful, that both my kindergartener and I were completely entranced. Celtic symbolism and mythology permeate the story. It's really wonderful, and will infuse children and adults with a sense of magic and wonder!",1286755200,5,2048,4.733893557422969
4080019,5,B0036TGSWG,"The trend in (Hollywood) animation as of late seems to be who can wow the audience the most. Disney, Pixar et. al. have pulled out all the stops to amaze everyone with seamless animation, incredible color schemes and mind boggling 3-D thrills. This is all fine and dandy, and some great stuff has come out of Hollywood, but sometimes less is more.

Enter Secret of the Kells. This movie is more subtle than much of what is released in American Cinemas. If you saw (and enjoyed) the incredible Azur and Asmar then this is for you. Both are in a similar vein. They both have simple but magical stories. Both have tremendously imaginative artwork and color pallets. And both have clever animation. Those before me have recounted the story so I won't bother but, though some of the elements might not be new, it's put together in such a way as to appear entirely fresh. The characters are realized through their design as much as through their script. Abbot Cellach is tall and has long powerful looking arms. They aren't muscular, Hercules looking arms. You just realize their sense of power by their design. The waifish Aisling is realized through her eyes and hair. All the characters have some indelible thumb print. The set designs are great and Moore, the director, seemed to say so much with so little.

I would like to say this is great for the entire family though the scenes with the wolves and the marauding Vikings might be too scary for the very young. If you think your kids can take it please try to get them to watch it. Animation can be a true art form and this movie underscores that in a big way.

Though Brother Tang might be a bit too much of an Italian characiture  it's a minor quibble to such a great achievement. This is a wonderful movie and a nice respite form the over-processed stuff we usually see.",1286496000,,1824,4.5349544072948325
4080020,5,B0036TGSWG,"I have a hard time articulating what this movie means to me. I suggest that you read the book titled ""How The Irish Saved Civilization"" by Thomas Cahill to get a glimpse into the story being told in this film.

4080021,5,B0036TGSWG,"The Secret Of Kells is in its own way almost equal to Up, and that's no mild compliment: I think Up is one of the finest works of animation since the Disney and Warner Bros classics of the 1930s-1950s. CGI took Up to another dimension, but hand-drawn animation is what makes Kells so fine. You can really feel these characters in a visceral way, and the fine script and voicework only adds to the lustre.

The 2D effect is very similar to last year's other excellent handmade animation masterwork, Sita Sings The Blues, as well as older fare like Samurai Jack and many anime classics. But Kells occupies its own space on that shelf due to its many unique qualities. The plot is a wonderful thing for kids to consider (and adults too!): the preservation of a book as the key to the preservation of a society. Of course it's ironic that we're watching a 'toon to learn that, but the odds are that kids will be more into this than into sitting in front of copies of the original (astonishingly gorgeous) Book of Kells....and perhaps it will lead them to the book itself and consideration of its ever more influential Celtic knots and other endless artistic intricacies.

McGuire and Gleeson's voices are perfection, as are everyone's, in fact. The colors are stunning but never overdone just for effect's sake, and it's the background matte paintings that are the real highlight for me here. You can just freeze the frame with every new background and revel in the detail, touch and luminous color. Check out the trees especially; the bark and leaves are rendered with deep feeling. There is a real love for and understanding of the power of nature here (pagan though it may be!).

And the dvd is a fabulous transfer. We watched it upconverted through a PS3 onto a large LCD screen and it looked as good or better than most blu-rays. I imagine the blu-ray of this would be even finer, but not once did I ever long for better picture quality. There's color and black depth to spare here.

There are some moments of (never gratuitous) violence, but nothing like what kids see on tv day in and out, so that's not a serious concern for most parents. The dialog is so intelligent and its ideas so worth considering that you'll delight in watching this with your kids, and you or they won't ever feel talked down to.

Congratulations to Tomm Moore and crew: Kells is a masterpiece worthy of its namesake.",1286323200,,2395,4.599531615925058
4080022,4,B0036TGSWG,"This film's nomination for an Academy Award drew my interest last year, and at last I've had a chance to see what all the buzz was about. Indeed, ""The Secret of Kells"" is unique and beautiful.

Blending vibrant colors, imaginative storytelling, this film (only 75 minutes long) gives us a look at Irish history and legend as it follows the story of young Brendan, an orphan living among monks. He hears tales of Aidan, a respected illuminator working on a wonderful book of light that dispels darkness, and when Brother Aidan shows up in their walled abbey, Brendan finds himself doing things he never dreamed of. From his first hesitant peek into the book to his courageous trek into the woods, Brendan's life changes. He is now part of completing this mysterious book before the marauding Vikings come to destroy the abbey and those things precious to the monks. He is also in conflict with his prideful uncle who rules the abbey through fear and control.

It's a tale of spiritual warfare, of legend, and history. Brendan's biggest blessing and curse come to him in the woods, the blessing in the form of Aisling, a silver-haired sprite who takes him on dashes through the trees (as beautifully rendered as anything in ""Avatar""); and the curse in the form of Crom Cruach, a devilish being that seeks to destroy good and light. Brendan, with the help of his friend, must face this monster if he is to save his uncle, the abbey, and the legendary Book of Kells.

At times, this movie is breathtaking in its lush landscapes and colors, its fresh storytelling and ideas. I was reminded of watching ""Watership Down"" as a child, moved by the images so different from standard Hollywood fare. That said, there are some amazing films coming from Pixar and even Dreamworks. The bar has been raised.

""The Secret of Kells"" is a wonderful accomplishment, well deserving of its Oscar nod, but it is more likely to appeal to adults and artists than to the younger crowd weaned on fast-paced storytelling with lots of humor and modern scenarios. Nevertheless, for those willing to take the chance, ""The Secret of Kells"" is sure to win you over.",1286323200,4,2133,4.741239892183288

4080024,5,B0036TGSWG,"As The Secret of Kells starts, a wild eyed goose runs amok through fields and village, up and down the scaffold that frames the walls of the abbey, being chased enthusiastically by a red haired, blue eyed boy and four different sized friars.

""This won't hurt a bit,"" the boy says, when he finally catches the reluctant animal. And proceeds to pull four feathers from its tail.

The feathers will be used by the friars to copy texts in the scriptorium. They will also get the boy, Brendan, in trouble with his uncle the abbot. Because, while Brendan dreams of books and drawings, the abbot wants him to help build the wall that will protect the abbey from the feared Viking raiders, and has forbidden him to leave the abbey.

Brendan follows his uncle's orders, until one day Brother Aidan, the only survivor of a Viking attack on his monastery, arrives at Kells seeking refuge. He brings with him the legendary Book of Iona, the book he has been working on most of his life. To finish it he will need rare acorns to make the colored ink and a mysterious crystal to help him create the fractal effect of his drawings.

Lured by the beauty of the pictures, Brendan disobeys his uncle and goes into the forest where the pagan spirits live and wolves lurk in the shadows.

Befriended by Aisling, a forest spirit, with long silvery hair, who can sing animals ([...]) to change shape at her will, Brendan collects the seeds and goes into the dark underworld where the evil presence that has killed Aisling's parents live, to get the crystal.

Ultimately the Vikings attack the abbey and the fate of the book that will be known as the Book of Kells (""the pinnacle of Insular illumination."" ""Ireland's finest national treasure"" according to the Wikipedia, [...]) rests in the hands of our young hero.

4080025,4,B0036TGSWG,"This Oscar nominated animated feature (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is surely one of the oddest subject ever for a movie: the creation in the 9th century of a famous illuminated manuscript, the book of Kells. In this fantastic retelling of that story, a prepubescent boy named Brendan, living in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a stern abbot who is worried preparing the defenses of the abbey from the impending attack by the feared vikings, must get into the forbidding surrounding forest to find the materials that a master illuminator named Aidan needs to finish the book. To do that task, in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling. Gorgeously and delicately drawn by hand (there is some computer animation in a few key passages) in a manner that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional Celtic art, and with a very creative use of color and all sorts of geometric shapes, this film is relentlessly strange, but strange in a good way, not in the off putting variety but in the eye opening sort. If one were to nitpick - beyond some anachronisms, like an African monk in 9th century Ireland - one would have to say that the blend of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this movie never really coalesce. And the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad. That's why I cannot give the movie the highest ranking. But these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film.",1279756800,3,1491,4.782945736434108
4080026,5,B0036TGSWG,"As a lover of world animation, I had to see this picture after it was nominated for an Oscar. Boy...I was not disappointed!  Ostensibly, it is the tale of the creation of the Book of Kells - a mythic explanation how this amazing illuminated manuscript of the Four Gospels came to be.  Commentators in the Middle Ages thought it was the product of angels...in the movie, it is a forest sprite who helps the hero (Brendan) find the rare materials to color the manuscript.  He has to finish the magical book, started by an earlier medieval monk, and keep the treasure safe from marauding Vikings.  Historically, the book did have to be protected from the Vikings of the North...so that part of the story is true.

The animation boasts brilliant colors and weaves Celtic images of yore into a fluid landscape of symbols and knotwork.  Perhaps, in this way, the inner mystery of the Book of Kells is preserved, even though the pictures in the authentic book in the Trinity College Library of Dublin are manifestly different. But cartoon and manuscript share mysterious symbolism, intricate ornamentation, and exceptional bold colors. Rarely does a film enthrall me to the point I can hardly breathe...yet this film had this dramatic impact on my person.

Possibly, the only other animated film that matches this style is ""The Boy Who Wanted to Be A Bear"" - an Eskimo fable created by a Danish animator.  These two movies use the lines of symbolism of native cultures in an exciting, vibrant fashion. Yes, these films prove WHY the art of two dimensional animation must continue.

After seeing the movie,  I was intrigued by the ancient book itself.  I sought out Bernard Meehan's treatise on ""The Book of Kells.""  Indeed, if ""The Secret of Kells"" moves others to explore the  background of the actual illuminated manuscript in Ireland, it will serve as a valuable tool in expanding childrens' curiosity of world history.",1278720000,,1915,4.855384615384615
4080027,5,B0036TGSWG,"The Book of Kells is Ireland's greatest treasure: an ancient book filled with exquisite illuminations.

Technically, ""The Secret of Kells"" is about the making of that book. But it's far more than that -- it's a visual hymn to Ireland's history, a coming-of-age tale, and a parable about Christianity coming to Ireland. Modern animation is suffused with exquisite Celtic art, music and a sense of fairy magic, and wrapped around a seemingly simple story about a boy learning about the power of art.

Abbot Cellach is determined to save the Abbey of Kells from the Viking invaders, so he's having the monks (including his nephew Brendan) build a vast wall around the abbey.  But when the illuminator Brother Aiden arrives, he brings with him the legendary Book of Iona. Brendan is fascinated by the Book, and ventures out into the forest -- against the abbot's orders -- to fetch ink-making supplies for Aiden.

He befriends a strange fairy girl named Aisling, and nature's beauty inspires his art -- until his uncle discovers that he's sneaking out, and forbids him to have anything to do with the forest or Aiden. But Brendan still wants to become a true master of illumination. And to finish the Book, he must go outside the abbey once more, and snatch away the magical Eye of an ancient sleeping evil...

You can see this movie from many angles -- it's a coming-of-age story, a homage to Irish culture, a story about the importance of art, and a parable about Christianity supplanting Celtic paganism (whilst drawing on its beauty).  But however you see it, ""The Secret of Kells"" is a beautiful story with a calm simplicity, and a slightly quirky sense of humor.

It also tackles some darker, more mature themes -- Brendan is exiled to a dungeon for disobeying his uncle, and he ventures into the cave of an ancient god surrounded by wriggling black roots. But directors Tomm Moore and Nora Twomey drop in lots of beautiful little moments as well, such as Aisling magically ""singing"" Aiden's cat into a floating spirit.

It also has a truly unique style of animation: ""Kim Possible"" style (simple designs with lots of sharp and/or rounded edges) with vibrant jewel-toned backdrops (the sunlit emerald hues of the forests). The best parts are when Celtic symbols and art are woven in, especially since they tend to float through the air like butterflies.

The writers also give great care to sketching out characters -- Brendan, the little monk who discovers the ""miracles"" of the world; Aisling, the elusive wolf-girl who assists him; and the grandfatherly Brother Aiden. On the flip-side we have Abbot Cellach, whose obsession with keeping Kells safe causes him to shut out art and beauty. No, he's not a 2-D bad guy -- he's just desperate.

Obviously it's not on the level of the Book of Kells, but ""The Secret of Kells"" is still a beautiful work of cinematic art. Adults will love it, kids will love it, and anyone with the blood of Ireland will marvel.",1278028800,57,2958,4.793713163064833

The only thing that made we give it a 4 is that the story isn't the greatest.  It is basically just a short legend that they use to create this stunning animation.

4080029,5,B0036TGSWG,"""I've lived through many ages
Through the eyes of salmon, deer and wolf
I have seen the north men invading Ireland
destroying all in search of gold
I have seen suffering in the darkness
yet, I have seen beauty thrive in the most fragile of places
I have seen the book,
the book that turned darkness into light...""

These are the opening words to what is a most remarkable film - Tomm Moore's The Secret of Kells. The Secret of Kells is no mere animated film...it is an illumination. Appropriately so for it is based upon the creation of what may be arguably called the single most beautiful work of human hands to ever have been created - the book of Kells. The book of Kells is a hand-written illuminated copy of the New Testament's four Gospels completed by Celtic monks cica 800 ad and imbued with a strong Celtic sensibility literally woven throughout more tradition Christian iconography. It is widely considered to be the pinnacle of Ireland's national treasures.

The story centres on the monastic community of Kells in Ireland during the age of the Viking raiders. The order has let its scriptorium (the place where the copying and illuminating was done by the monks) become a lesser priority as the abbot works the community feverishly to build high walls and a gate around the monastery. The task is ostensibly to keep out invading Vikings (north men as they are called in the movie) but it becomes apparent that the abbot is trying to protect and hide him and the monastery from the world.

Into the midst of this construction comes Brother Aiden, fleeing from the destruction of the abbey at Iona and bringing with him a brilliantly illuminated text he calls aptly called the book of Iona. Aiden befriends the abbot's nephew, the young orphan Brendan (voiced brilliantly by Evan Mc Guire). We're never told much of the back story of the abbot or Brendan but that works fine in this film and allows the imagination to contribute to the success of this compelling story.

Brother Aidan brings the book of Iona into the scriptorium of Kells in order to continue working on it and enlists the assistance of Brendan to secure for him some berries from elm trees in the forest. Brendan agrees though he has been forbidden from the forest and, in fact, has never left the abbey. As Brendan and Aidan's cat Panger Bon (another refugee from Iona) wander into the forest they get predictably lost (although this does not diminish the film at all) and meet the apparently young girl Aisling (pronounced Ashlyn and voiced fabulously by Christen Mooney) who is a forest spirit of some sort and who's voice is the one speaking the film's opening words. It is at this point the tale takes off.

The film combines a powerful and provocative story with deep themes of light overcoming darkness, courage, friendship and struggle. There are clear Celtic pagan undercurrents to the film but in no way does one feel as though this story is an attempt to reassert a pagan paradigm over and above the Christian one which has developed in Ireland for more than a millennium. Rather there is a sense that the story is telling us a little about the subtle ways Celtic culture wound its way into Christianity. Some have been critical of the ancient church's attempts to co-opt pagan culture but with Ireland it seems a little more like the Celtic in some way inspired a deeper and more thoughtful Christian spirituality than can be found elsewhere. To this day more than a thousand years after its construction the monastery at Iona continues to offer Christian's a place for deep spiritual contemplation and renewal. I am not suggesting the film presents a kind of syncretism whereby Christianity and Celtic paganism combined to create something new. Rather in the spirit of C.S. Lewis who spoke of ""shards of God's truth"" being found throughout creation we see a beautiful and nuanced Celtic informing of Christianity that would help it see its faith in some brilliant and remarkable ways (the symbol of the infinite God in the unending Celtic knotwork; the Trinity as seen in the shamrock and the trefoil interweaving Celtic designs etc). Most striking one cannot avoid the comment spoken as voiceover in the beginning of the film by Aislyn when she says ""I have seen the book, the book that turned darkness into light..."" There is also another message that comes out hinting that the book (whether the book of Kells specifically or the more broadly Bible we're not sure...perhaps both) ""was never meant to be hidden away behind a wall, locked away from the world which inspired its creation...you must take the book to the people so that they may have hope, let it light the way in these dark days...""

Your ears will be treated to some absolutely amazing Celtic music (Aisling's song is sung with a beautiful innocence) as well as Medieval Latin hymning and of course, most importantly, incredible visuals. The film is animated in what is becoming known as ""the old style"" of 2D hand drawing and inking (although there are times when you can see CG was used). Done by Cartoon Saloon based out of Kilkenny, Ireland the style of animation is stunning and quite frankly required given that the story is really about a hand illuminated work of art. The Secret of Kells is refreshing in an age where most animated films are moving toward CG and 3D (except for some notable brilliant anime films from Hayao Mitazaki's Studio Ghibli and other exceptions like Disney's recent The Princess and the Frog).

As much as the story is riveting it is the animation that is really the main character and keeps one riveted to the screen. Clearly heavily influenced by the book itself there is also heavy Celtic influence apparent as well as Norse. The animation style and colour changes as the mood of the film changes and in many instances it is almost as though you are peering into an illuminated work of art rather than watching a movie. There is an amazing scene in which Brendan, Brother Aidan and Panger Bon are fleeing and the animators chose to present them as though they were moving through a triptych (three paneled picture). This technique also allows for a very creative showing of the passage of time. At other times the action is framed as though moving on the pages of a book. The animators fill the edges of the frame with smaller moving images reminiscent of illuminator's work both rough and finished in nature and while some might consider this a distraction it works very well with the overall feel of the movie.

Overall the film is one of the greatest animated features I have ever watched and, as much as I appreciated (loved really) the movie Up from Pixar, The Secret of Kells should have won the academy award for best animated feature film. You will want to watch this film over and over again on your own, with friends or with family because it is simply spellbinding.",1274054400,170,6871,4.724770642201835

My favorite was the cat, Pangur Ban. And interesting take on a violent history.",1523491200,,254,4.7727272727272725
8390171,5,B0036TGSWG,"The story may have been a work of fiction but at the time the actual book of Kells was written was during the Norsemen invaded Ireland & British isles. Many of the illuminated manuscripts that were preserved from the dark ages from being totally engulfed were the stout walls of monks like the abbot as well as the abbot of fiona teaching Brendan how to make illuminated books. It is teaching lessons I hope will inspire many young & old artists to know intricate designs with hands equipped with quills & colors from natural sources like these will be difficult to replicate with a computer. The movie brings out just how difficult the job to complete a manuscript like this really wasn't a work of fiction. that a few monks produced a work of art that took a lifetime. The Irish touch of including the fluidity of the fairy (faery) as well as the Celtic folk music immerses the story flowing pace to the script. Even the wolves, trees have the Celtic knotting in their style. By keeping the plot simple I spent my time viewing the color, styles of the lush details. This movie for animation fans is a nice break from anime action films (except studio Ghiboli). It deserved all it rewards since it was a work of animation elevated to a work of art.",1522627200,,1249,4.506607929515418
