""Be Right Back"" is a deeply moving story of a woman devastated when her lover is killed in a car accident. Unable to move forward in her life, her best friend tries to help by hiring a company that uses all the on line communications your loved one ever created to let you 'stay in touch' through messages with the departed.

Rather than descending into the obvious 'internet gone mad' scarefest, this is a heartbreaking meditation on loss, holding on, letting go and the nature of love. Quite profound, and wonderfully acted.

""White Bear"" is one of the most successful cases of capturing what it feels like to be inside a nightmare I've seen in quite a while. A young woman wakes to find herself chased by very scary violent people while other people stand around and watch or photograph it. She has no idea why she is being hunted, or how to get away. Simple, but extremely well done. The pay-off twists didn't blow me away, but everything leading up to them was first rate and truly frightening film-making.

""The Waldo Moment"". Switching gears completely, this is a pretty sharp political satire. A cartoon bear - a popular figure with a late night talk show - regularly interviews politicians, and is loved for the way he exposes their hypocrisies. But things get ever stranger when - as a publicity stunt - the ""Waldo"" the bear actually runs for office. Personally I found this the weakest of the pieces. It was easier to get out in front of in terms of both plot twists and underlying ideas. But it's still well done and never less than interesting, with some important (if not surprising) comments about the toxic mix that has arisen through the mating of media, entertainment and politics.",1457049600,,1754,4.666666666666667
