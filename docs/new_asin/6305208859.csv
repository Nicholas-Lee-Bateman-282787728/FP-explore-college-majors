987380,5,6305208859,"This is not only one of the better Troma releases, it's also one of the better movies I've ever seen. The story is about a vampire who contracts AIDS. Director/writer Hans Rodionoff manages to make a very tragic  circumstance, coming down with AIDS, very funny, without making fun of the  virus, or those that have it. This is also due to the fine acting of star  Alex Erkiletian, playing the comical Reed, the henchman to the lead  vampire.  I can't recommend this enough. After watching the movie be sure  to watch it again, to hear the alternate audio track by Alex and Hans. This  is even funnier than the original movie sound. The only drawback is that  there are no unique added features to this Troma DVD other than the other  audio track. If there were some this would be perfect.",962409600,9,788,4.531914893617022

The vampires familiar was ok as well, and with some decent acting coaching could be pretty good. The others were stiff, contrived and really quite dumb. Blah.",1459296000,,255,4.565217391304348

That is the fate of one nightly bloodsucker named Anthony, who is also the lead singer of the up-and-coming band called Plasma.  He uses his rock star status to lure hot, big-breasted groupies back to his lair.  Sounds like the perfect setup, but...maybe he shoulda put a condom on them fangs.

Part dark satire, part horror-comedy, and part erotic-thriller, this had potential to be one of the greatest vampire flicks ever made.  Seriously.  I expected a campy gorefest, but that is not the case.  The script is clever, the acting is solid, and there are some totally top-notch sex scenes mixed with blood spillage.  Good times.

But unfortunately, the news of the AIDS virus puts a damper on the fun (imagine that).  I lost a little interest as the story winded down.  Still this is one of the best Troma movies around, and a very solid entry into any vampire DVD collection.",1243728000,3,1072,4.755434782608695
7885049,5,6305208859,"i should say that i do make a hobby of watching b movies, and i don't critique them, tear them apart or put them down, i just very much enjoy many of them-- i'd much rather stick to the soft, dark underbelly of the film industry and the birds can have the flashy big-budget hoo-ray-for-hollywood stuff. to me sucker is just a very sweet movie-- i really like vampire stories, heart-warming relationships and quirky/offbeat comedy, all of which (and more) are contained in this piece of work. i like the acting, i think this was well cast, the people seem to really get into their parts in a sincere way. there is a combination of a gothic atmosphere and a warm hearted feeling--which sounds unusual but somehow works very well, and smoothly avoids cliches---a thing which i feel starkly polarizes audiences in the way they react to a film. to me it doesn't matter who knows i'm watching this movie, it's just a touching bit of filmmaking and i'm simply happy to be able to enjoy it.",1165881600,5,982,4.553672316384181
7885050,1,6305208859,"This isn't worth the postage you must pay to have it shipped to your home.  What a waste of time and money.  A vampire with AIDS?  A cast with no talent.  A story with no plot.  My 17-year-old son could have done better with a free webcam for subscribing to DSL.  This TROMA disaster is an insult to filmmaking.  Get out your crosses and Holy water and rid this flick from your library.  This ranks, in my book, as one of (if not THE) worse films I've ever seen.  Trust me.  Get out now, while you still have a choice.  PR",1026000000,14,522,4.069306930693069

The story is about some neards that goes out to the big woods to have a good camping hollyday..Well, if they knew that there where a insane woodsman equiped with a Machete,a sniper rifle and a fifhing rod waiting for some fresh meat, they may woud decide to camp in their own back garden.

7885052,2,6305208859,"For some reason I continue to love Troma's films. I saw this one ... and I thought, ""Hey, why not?"" This is a creative vampire movie. It involves a vampire who has AIDS which is a rare concept for vampire movies. However, the beginning was so much like Queen of the Damned, I was waiting for Stuart Townsend to pop up. Oh, and if only he would have. The lead character could not have been any more annoying. Sure, Troma's movies are always travesties of great cinema, but almost always, they are incredibly creative. There is nudity, violence and language. This movie is strictly for Troma fans.",1017792000,4,595,4.570093457943925
