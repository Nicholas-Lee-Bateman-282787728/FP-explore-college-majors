8706233,5,B00UGQ47WU,One of my personal favorite Mel Gibson movies. It is very reminiscent of Payback but with a lot more humor. I don't mean the plot is similar but classic Mad Mel playing a seasoned career criminal who gets the best of his adversaries. Payback Get the Gringo and Blood Father probably being my three favorites,1522972800,,307,4.6
