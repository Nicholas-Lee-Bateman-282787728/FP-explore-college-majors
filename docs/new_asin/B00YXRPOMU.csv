8719318,5,B00YXRPOMU,"Essential for fans of film esoterica, a bleakly hilarious autopsy of the 1996 Brando-Kilmer horror folly ""The Island of Dr Moreau,"" exhumed 20 years later by a soul-shattered original director, misused actors, incredulous technicians and bemused producers. The trauma was still fresh in 2014. Madness, madness, in a tropical cesspool - and then came Marlon!

An industry legend turns out to be true. Writer-director Richard Stanley, having  been brutally fired and replaced, snuck back into his own movie in beast costume to watch the disaster play out.

A wickedly well done documentary and a warning nightmare to aspiring moviemakers. Film school showings should be mandatory.",1458777600,3,678,5.438095238095238
8719319,4,B00YXRPOMU,"A very engaging story of the fascinatingly failed film ""The Island Of Dr. Moreau"", with revealing interviews by most of the (available) production staff and cast.  But oddly, the actor that played the protagonist, David Thewles, is not only absent -- he's not even mentioned.  That head-scratching omission is, well, head-scratching.  Maybe someday we will get a movie about the making of ""Lost Soul"", where this mystery will be, well, demystified.",1445904000,,448,5.28169014084507

Several years ago, a friend of mine told me I needed to sit down and watch John Frankenheimers THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU.  When I asked why, he just smiled and said, Youll see why after you watch itits bizarre.  His enigmatic answer was enough to prompt me to watch the film, so I did.  He was certainly right; the film is a very strange take on H.G. Wells bookbut its also way out in left field on certain things.  I always found the film odd, and now, thanks to LOST SOUL: THE DOOMED JOURNEY OF RICHARD STANLEYS ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, I think I understand why.  This amazing documentary sheds light on one of the weirdest filmmaking experiences ever recorded in history.

I always wondered what happened to Richard Stanley.  After directing two cult-favorite films (HARDWARE and DUST DEVIL), he dropped off the planet for a long time.  I didn't hear anything about him for years, until back in 2012, when he directed a short in THE THEATRE BIZARRE horror anthology.  I hope the release of this documentary will help usher in his reemergence into the realm of filmmaking.

LOST SOUL: THE DOOMED JOURNEY OF RICHARD STANLEYS ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU is shot like most documentaries and looks good onscreen.  The behind-the-scenes story is exhaustively fleshed out, and the result is a top-notch documentary that is entertaining and engrossing.

The film contains a slew of famous faces, including Fairuza Balk, Rob Morrow, Robert Shaye, and even Richard Stanley himself.  I wish the production team had gotten Val Kilmer for an interview, however I can understand why Kilmer probably did not want to be on camera; not a single cast or crew member had anything positive to say about him.

This fascinating glimpse into the nightmarish film experience behind THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU is something you simply must see to believe.  Richard Stanley was fired after four days of filming.  Afterwards, more chaos ensued:  John Frankenheimer was called in to finish the film and decided to rewrite the script on the fly; meanwhile, Marlon Brando started acting crazy, and Val Kilmers diva-like antics were nothing short of jaw-dropping.  The events prior to and during the film shoot were a perfect storm for New Line Cinema, and its a wonder the company didn't go bankrupt because of it.

LOST SOUL: THE DOOMED JOURNEY OF RICHARD STANLEYS ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU  is a huge win for me, and I recommend checking it out as soon as possible.  If youve never seen the Frankenheimer/Stanley film, give it a look and then watch the documentary.  But if you are already familiar with it, this film will answer many of the questions youve harbored over the years.",1437523200,10,2711,4.758029978586724
