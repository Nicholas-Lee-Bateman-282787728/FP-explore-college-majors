8564253,2,B00B8U5QCS,It was mostly old news reels of the time. It had the BeeGees on the cover I thought it might have some songs of the time but it did not.the video on the DVD was not video quality. I bought this for our wedding anniversary and was disappointed.,1481068800,,243,4.083333333333333
8564254,4,B00B8U5QCS,AS good little extra for someone who is hard to by for.  If they have every thing and your considering this with some other smaller gifts - this would be a good purchase.,1369008000,,170,4.151515151515151
