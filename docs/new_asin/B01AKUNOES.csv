7606972,2,B01AKUNOES,"This the only season of Haven I won't buy. The tone is pretty dark throughout and whatever ""happy"" parts of the finale there were didn't come close to offsetting the heartbreak. It's a shame, because I really loved this series and its characters. It deserved a much better send-off.",1458172800,7,282,4.775510204081633
7606973,5,B01AKUNOES,Haven: TV SERIES IS THE BEST SO FAR.,1456358400,,36,3.625
7606974,5,B01AKUNOES,I have been watching haven since it first came out and thank god syfy decided to release the final season on dvd  and not just release it on Netflix.....huge fan..and thanks to the actors who made  this story come to life. Just bought it yesterday April can not get here soon enough,1455321600,5,282,4.403846153846154
7606975,5,B01AKUNOES,"Haven is one of the best ""new"" series in the last 10 years
It's biggest downfall was never gaining a massive mainstream audience  being on SyFi
There are still closed minded tv fans that don't understand how excellent SyFi is as a basic cable channel
Now in 2016 they are at a cross roads with a handful of great exclusives gone by either canceled to soon (Dominion, Defiance and Helix)
Or the series just ran down and finished up Lost Girl, Continuum and Haven)
Haven should be on the watch list of every fan of Sci-Fi, fantasy and horror
It's super unique hybrid of Twin Peeks meets The 4400

The final season is heartbreaking and very sad for any long time Haven fan

There are a handful of really good pay offs but, there are also unnecessary deaths of key characters
One thing for sure the 6-8 episodes where the town is surround by mist
Haven did a better Under the Dome then the complete 3rd season of Under the Dome
and this is a basic cable series in Canada
I have the first four seasons of Haven on blu ray the 5th and final season is in My Wish List
I really can't rate the final season cause I love Haven and it should've lasted much longer
But, at least all the fans did get closer with the town of Haven Maine and ""the troubles""
Thank You for a amazing adventure and great characters
RIP Haven 2010-2015
You'll be loved and missed for a long time...................",1453852800,19,1379,4.357976653696498

7607047,4,B01AKUNOES,"Haven was a great series. The only thing that keeps it from 5 Star is that it really is a two part DVD collection. The first ""final"" season is properly marked as Part One. No where on this DVD collectio does it say Final Season Part Two, Nor is it advertised as being a Part Two. Many of us prefer to collect the entire season with one purchase. If the Haven fan bought this one, thinking that it was the entire season would be disappointed to find it covers the last half of the season.",1470355200,8,487,4.136842105263158

This show runs the gamut from being hilarious, to extremely serious, to making you cry to laughing out loud.  And also makes you think... hmmm...  what if??  LOL

It had heartbreaking moments in this last season but as past seasons have shown us, there is happiness and light after the dark.  I liked the way it ended and will be revisiting this series in the future to watch it again, I'm sure!!",1467331200,,534,4.3979591836734695

7607069,5,B01AKUNOES,I couldn't wait to get this final season but like the other reviewers this is the last half of Season 5 not the full complete season. It didn't matter to me since I already had the 1st half and just needed this to complete it. I recently started watching the 1st season again & realized that the characters use to be funnier & stories were less dark then they are in this last season.

7607086,5,B01AKUNOES,"I've been a fan of ""Haven"" since the first scene of the first episode in the first season.
Throughout its run, I've enjoyed its quirky characters and the situations they've found themselves in. That said, while I was sad to see that it was drawing to a close, I was eager to see how the writers would wrap up this truly interesting show. I was not disappointed.
Weaving old story lines and characters into the final season, tying up loose ends, and carefully orchestrating the narrative; the writers were able to close the ""Haven"" saga in a way that did not leave a slew of unanswered questions.
And, as an added bonus, they brought in William Shatner to play an important part in the season's final episodes.
""Haven"" has been a great show for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that its core characters have always had the good of the town at heart. They have been willing, throughout the series, to make sacrifices in order to preserve this special place and that holds true in this final season. It sounds corny, I know, but there is something to be said for a television program that reminds us, as viewers, that there are some things worth sacrificing our personal happiness, and perhaps even our lives, for; some things that demand we rise above our own desires.
Led by Emily Rose - who almost didn't get the part of Audrey Parker because some show executives thought she was ""too pretty"" - the core cast has always provided viewers with excellent portrayals. Lucas Bryant and Eric Balfour, as Parker's close companions Nathan and Duke, have always stood out in my mind as actors who were exceptional in their roles. I was particularly impressed with Balfour's portrayal of the smuggler Duke Crocker, a shady character that, over the course of the show's run, transforms into a truly heroic figure.
I'm not about to reveal any spoilers, that would be unfair to viewers who have not seen the show, but I will say that it ends on what was, for me, a very satisfying note.
As I said, I was sad that it ended but very pleased with the way it did.",1464307200,10,2062,4.545698924731183

7607090,5,B01AKUNOES,"I don't know why they named this the way they did, or why they named Season 5 as ""Haven: Season 5, Vol. 1.""
AFA I'm concerned, ""Haven: Season 5, Vol. 1"" was Season 5,
and ""Haven: Complete Final Season"" is Season 6.
That would give each season 13 episodes, instead of 13 episodes for Seasons 1-4 and 26 episodes for ""Season 5.""
After all, the ""Haven: Complete Final Season"" was aired 10 months after ""Haven: Season 5, Vol. 1"" finished its 13th episode.
I guess they had something less ambitious in mind and the die was cast, but they could have simply called this ""Season 6.""",1463529600,,574,4.4245283018867925

7607115,5,B01AKUNOES,"I am incredibly sad that there will be no new Haven episodes :( This was, by far, my favorite show on television and there really isn't anything to replace it.

SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!

SERIOUSLY ~ SPOILERS!!!

Audrey: I think these last episodes really highlighted who Audrey was (both in her past and present). But I have to say that this is the only season where there were moments I really got angry with her. When she was constantly putting blame on Duke for everything, when it was NOT his doing... I literally yelled at the tv. She asked him several times in the past to kill for her, not thinking of the impact that would have on him. Then, because of Mara, suddenly everything wrong in Haven was Duke's fault because he left and that is NOT the case. That aside, her foremost purpose was to save Haven from the Troubles, and that is what she did. As heartbreaking as it was to watch, she held true to who she was, putting the town ahead of her own wants and loves.

Nathan: Normally , Nathan was the quieter one, the man of few words. However, this last half of season five showcased the incredible talent that is Lucas Byrant. His speech during The Trial of Nathan Wournos was wonderful, but the last monologue, in the last episode as Audrey disappeared with her father into the new barn, was so powerful that I was brought to tears. I am so glad we got to see Nathan in that light, to see him really shine as a character. Bravo, writers, and bravo, Lucas- job magnificently well done.

Duke: Oh, Duke. I am so upset he died. I think it was unfair for him as a character but it also somehow fit. Duke had so much character growth...it was incredible to watch him go from what he was in Season One, to who he became in Season Five. His arc was the most amazing and heartbreaking out of everyone on the show. He was put through the ringer in this last season, and Eric Balfour did a fantastic job portraying that.

Vince and Dave: Two of my favorites. I'm so sad about Dave :( Though, learning more about him this season was wonderful- often amusing (The Old Switcheroo 1 & 2!) as well as heartbreaking. Vince's ultimate role as the new caretaker of the Barn seemed fitting for his character, and I'm glad that we finally learned more about him just as we did Dave.

Dwight: I love Dwight, and he's another character that had a fantastic arc through the last three seasons. I'm so happy he was reunited with Lizzy.

Charlotte: became a great character, and her announcement that she was Mara's (Audrey's) mother was shocking but I came to really love her. Especially her and Dwight. When she died I was so upset for him, more than I was that Audrey had lost her mother.

Overall: I loved this season, HOWEVER, I am greatly irked about how they ended it. Sending Audrey back to Nathan as Paige was a slap in the face to fans. There was no good reason to do that, IMHO. The only thing that made up for it even slightly was that they sent her back with baby James. I will forever be unforgiving of the writers' decision to do that.

I did love this last season, though it was emotionally gut-wrenching. I loved that we saw some of the original Troubles and that those original characters came back to those roles. The new Troubles were a nice touch as well (I'm looking at you, Vanity and Sun-Glow troubles LOL). I will miss this show terribly.",1460505600,20,3345,4.406807131280389
7607116,1,B01AKUNOES,"Assuming amazon and/or EntertainmentOne hasn't fixed this yet, buyers should be warned that currently the title of the listing is very misleading.  The title shown of the cover graphic isn't much better.  According to all early reports, that I've been able to find anyway, this is merely the second half of the fifth season.  It's not a ""Complete"" season.  Collectors who prefer to hold out for complete season sets, rather than supporting the relatively new, exploitive marketing gimmick of splitting seasons into two releases to encourage sells via lower upfront prices, but that ultimately do little more than trick consumers into spending more money, will need to continue waiting.  Though, in this case, it would appear that an actual complete fifth season release isn't coming.  We might have more luck waiting on a complete series set though.",1458518400,43,849,5.160583941605839
