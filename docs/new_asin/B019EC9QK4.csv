7570937,5,B019EC9QK4,Saw this movie at the official premier in Salt Lake City. It's absolutely hilarious! James Marsters plays the perfect villian! It's a witty fantasy adventure for the whole family!,1453680000,2,179,5.206896551724138
7570938,5,B019EC9QK4,"I like the original name ""Dragon Warriors"" better, but nonetheless, this is a fun and entertaining movie! I saw the premiere in Salt Lake City, and I was laughing so hard! Great acting and James Marsters definitely steals the show! Everyone will find something to enjoy in this movie! ;)",1453680000,5,287,4.76
7570939,5,B019EC9QK4,"My friend and I love this movie. By no means a serious drama, this comedy had us in stitches laughing. Very much enjoyed this fun movie. Best girls night ever",1453680000,2,158,4.3
7570940,5,B019EC9QK4,"This movie honored so many genres of classic film and story telling, yet was able to imbune its own style to make an original story from so many old tropes.
It was hilarious, with so many shining moments that took my breath away at the sheer silliness and brilliance of thought.
This had the comedic stylings of 'Shaolin Soccer', 'The Princesses Bride' and 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'
It is worth a watch and to add it to your library",1453680000,9,434,4.506329113924051

I would highly recommend a watch.",1453680000,2,49,5.125
7570942,5,B019EC9QK4,Fun little movie my son and I caught at the Salt Lake Premier.  Originally named Dragon Warriors.,1453680000,2,97,4.705882352941177
7570943,5,B019EC9QK4,"My wife and I saw the film when it premiered.  The script is hilarious!  The film doesn't take itself too seriously so though there is action and drama, we were laughing the ENTIRE TIME (reasonably speaking)!  The cast has good chemistry, good cinematography, and excellent use of slow motion shots.

Will it win an oscar?  Perhaps not, but those who see the film should not take it too seriously either.  Too many films that aren't star wars are getting obliterated on social media, and sadly it has too strong of an influence than those who see the film and then read reviews.  This is a genuine theatrical experience to be enjoyed by your group of friends, your spouse, yourself, or whomever you can get to see it!",1453680000,2,717,4.5984251968503935
7570944,5,B019EC9QK4,"This was originally titled Dragon Warriors. I have no idea what possessed the distributor to change it to this goofy title.

I haven't seen the movie yet, but I helped to fund it on Kickstarter and I'm counting the days until they send my autographed DVD.  I'm pre-ordering a DVD here, too, so I have one to watch (over and over again) and one as a keepsake.  :-)

Check out the Dragon Warriors Kickstarter page for more info.

7570945,5,B019EC9QK4,Had a chance to see this movie at the official premiere in Salt Lake City last year. The movie was a fun little adventure and I really enjoyed it. The villain played by James Marsters was my favorite. It was great watching him play a heart broken wizard. He plays unrequited love so well. Can't wait to get my DVD and watch it again.,1452556800,7,333,4.21875
7570946,5,B019EC9QK4,My husband and I seen this movie at a film festival in Chicago! It is hilarious! We loved the movie!! Look past the title and give the movie a chance!,1452556800,8,150,4.033333333333333

7571018,5,B019EC9QK4,"It is a hilarious movie full of sarcasm and jokes. If they had a bit more budget it would have been a better production but scenario and dialog (Specially between brothers) well written, never a dull moment:D

I would like to see more of Dudes and Dragons!!",1528675200,,257,4.468085106382978

7571050,5,B019EC9QK4,"Friggin' hysterical, especially when seen as I first did--at a special viewing at Comicon.  Destined to be a cult classic!",1523404800,,122,5.1
7571051,3,B019EC9QK4,Not too inspiring. Mostly sigh worthy everywhere. There's some sincere moments that are nice but are drowned out but the outright silliness of the entire movie. It skips a lot of typical D&D jokes and references but just grabs for the other low hanging fruit of other movies of the time.,1522886400,,287,4.647058823529412
7571052,5,B019EC9QK4,"Good clean indie fun at it's best.  If you appreciate the fine art of silly this is a safe bet.  Not for critics, trolls of Game of Thrones fans.",1522281600,,145,3.9655172413793105

7571067,4,B019EC9QK4,"This was good. Not quite princess bride good, with a lower budget and more of a farcical spin, but in that direction.",1520985600,,117,4.363636363636363
7571068,4,B019EC9QK4,Lots of good fun. Production value better than most grade B movies. Acting is tongue in cheek but a good story line and some good belly laughs along the way. Not a bad way to spend a Sunday afternoon.,1520726400,,200,4.153846153846154
7571069,5,B019EC9QK4,"Very funny, creative, and touching.  This is part spoof, part adventure, and every minute was engaging in one of those ways.  The special effects are directly from 1995, but the comedy was timeless and uproarious.",1520121600,2,213,5.057142857142857

7571071,5,B019EC9QK4,"Purposefully campy.  Meant to be a B-movie.  Like watching a rip-roaring, table top D&D game gone live.

One of the actors from Mythica (Adam Johnson) is playing a main character here in Dudes & Dragons.  Mythica is also very D&Dish, but meant to be taken more seriously.  This movie was just a fun riot.

Another Kick Starter project that hits the mark by understanding and catering to its intended audience.",1519516800,,409,4.771428571428571
7571072,5,B019EC9QK4,Hilarious in the most nerdiest of ways.  I was very surprised about this movie.  I thought it was going to be another terrible B movie that I would barely get through but it was very funny.  The way they poked fun at the Genre itself was great.  The graphics in the movie were surprisingly good.  From the overly used dramatic slow motion sequences to the Dragon itself.  It was very enjoyable to watch.  I recommend watching it with some friends who have a sense of humor to make the experience even better.,1518652800,,508,4.456521739130435
7571073,5,B019EC9QK4,Great humor!,1518220800,,12,5.5
7571074,5,B019EC9QK4,"OK - it's cheesy - very cheeeseeeey. But I hardly laugh that hard. I just had a six pack, Big Screen and Headphones... still laughing",1518220800,,133,4.36
7571075,5,B019EC9QK4,Ridiculously funny. A wonderfully comedic fantasy adventure starring  Luke Perry (spoiler: He dies in the first five minutes) and the ever sexy James Marsters as the evil sorcerer that got a thing for his cousin and a pissed off dragon that's killing lovers wherever they be found. Seriously laughed my way through it.,1518048000,,318,5.0
7571076,5,B019EC9QK4,This flick is purposefully B-rated and a bunch of fun. would be great for a like minded film party.,1517616000,,99,4.2631578947368425

7571092,5,B019EC9QK4,"This movie isn't supposed to a summer blockbuster or oscar contender.  It's supposed to be a spoof and it definitely is that.  It's not a comedy, per se, so it's not some endless supply of stupid jokes or slapstick humor, but it's funny nonetheless.  Mostly, it's supposed to be completely stupid.  Anyone that's played D&D (on top of being a fantasy/sci-fi fan) will get more out of this than others as many of the references are as much to the RPG game as to any movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film precisely because it was stupid and funny, and because it was clearly SUPPOSED to be those things.",1515628800,,602,4.537037037037037
7571093,3,B019EC9QK4,It has its silly funny moments,1515456000,,30,4.166666666666667
7571094,5,B019EC9QK4,This was great. Comedy Action is hard to pull off. Actors and dialogue made it easy to forgive some low budget effects.,1515369600,,119,4.454545454545454
7571095,4,B019EC9QK4,Just plan old comedy spoofing. Better written and directed than SW:TLJ.,1515283200,2,71,5.545454545454546

7571108,5,B019EC9QK4,"Wow, this was really fun. After a long, hard day working it was really enjoyable to sit back and be entertained. I loved the movie references. It was really pretty well made and everything just pretty much clicked. Music, acting, special effects and directing all seemed well done. I give it 5 stars for being exactly what it was meant to be.

7571112,5,B019EC9QK4,Funny funny movie! No good acting. No good story line. Just silly crap through out. Enjoy.,1513987200,,90,4.6875
7571113,5,B019EC9QK4,"Seriously...if you need a break from too much ""Cereal"" warrior vs beast movies... Watch this!  I enjoyed it so pooh on you who didnt",1513468800,,132,4.5
7571114,5,B019EC9QK4,A fantastic comedic take on a fantasy quest movie!,1513123200,,50,4.666666666666667
7571115,4,B019EC9QK4,"To be completely honest...there was way TOO MUCH bloom in this film. I think the entire thing would be a heckuva lot better without the severe graphic overall most of the scenes got.  And the castle scene at the end was really a bad idea because the CGI was noticeably worse...like way worse than the rest of the movie.  It kinda made the ending feel cheap and like Mario's Castle on the N64'ish.  I will say that the actual props, swords, costumes and locations that were real were really well done as was the magic effects.  The dragon, meh...not so much.  Some really fun stuff though with the Goblins and the Morphlings.

Obviously, this was all shot on a green screen, but man, I couldn't help but enjoy the story and the cast interactions. The story is actually good...the actor's are all pretty much competent with Camilan being the worst I suppose.  The Orc actor was really funny and great. Take it for what it was...a budget fantasy film.  I actually liked it. James Marsters was fantastic, he really was chewing it up as the villain but I gotta tell you, I want to see Adam Johnson in an a-budget film. This guy has chops, is likeable, and deserves to be seen on the big screen. All-in-all, a fun film once you get used to the over-the-top visual effects doctoring.  I'm kinda worried that it might make most people turn it off within the first 10 minutes, but it does get better so stick with it.",1512950400,2,1408,4.46875
7571116,4,B019EC9QK4,"I really expected to get 5 minutes into this and shut it off, but I watched the whole thing and enjoyed it. Such a bad title. Just awful. Don't judge it by that.",1512864000,2,161,3.909090909090909
7571137,5,B019EC9QK4,It was entertaining! Genuinely funny hits and some nostalgia for the genre. I like Adam Johnson (played Ramicus) in anything he's in.,1512864000,2,133,5.090909090909091
7571138,1,B019EC9QK4,If you watch it youll be like the rest trying to make excuses why you watched it,1512691200,,80,3.764705882352941
7571139,4,B019EC9QK4,That was Hilarious !!,1512345600,,21,4.5
7571140,3,B019EC9QK4,"I wanted to see what James Marsters was up to since Buffy. I really liked him in that series. But this is a really bad film. I get that it is supposed to be a sarcastic flick, but it just can't measure up. Marsters was not given a well written character. The cinematography sucks. The writing is terrible. Some of the jokes are pretty good but they are very few and far between. I couldn't recommend this to anyone I know. Given that, I made it through till the end.",1512259200,,466,4.188888888888889

7571142,4,B019EC9QK4,Not to be taken seriously.  This is a spoof and a lot of fun to watch.  I really enjoyed it in all it's cheesiness.  It ws just fun.,1511654400,2,132,3.642857142857143
7571143,5,B019EC9QK4,"This was an excellent flick. The cast was clearly having a great deal of fun poking fun of pretty much every single sci fi and adventure film they could. I'm sure I missed some of it just because there was so much.

If you are interested in a film that even pokes fun of itself this one certainly fits the bill. It's a million laughs and a few more. Even the effects are reminiscent of the original star wars with the myriad of mistakes and old tech. The only thing that would have made it better is to get Elvira to narrate it.",1511568000,,528,4.12621359223301
7571144,5,B019EC9QK4,"This is a hidden gem.  Being into fantasy and D&D helps a lot.  I love the comedy and how unserious it takes itself.  My kids absolutely laugh at it, and it is one my kids new favorite.  I would love to see more like this.",1511308800,,222,3.8666666666666667
7571145,5,B019EC9QK4,"It's a SPOOF! Enjoy it for what it is.  There is a fair level of comedic lines and the acting is appropriate for this.  Of course, the ladies in here are beauteous and should have had more lines but alas ... Suffice it to say, it is funny, corny, and cheesy but good humored light hearted D&D fun.  If you are not into the genre, move along.  The CGI is about what you would expect for this level of a film, it was actually better than I dared to hope.  The outtakes in the credits are funny too!",1511308800,2,496,4.020408163265306
7571146,4,B019EC9QK4,"That perfect level of cheese. If you're sick in bed and need a light silly fantasy, this is just the ticket.

7571170,5,B019EC9QK4,Loved the movie. Sure to be a cult classic.,1511049600,,43,3.888888888888889
7571171,1,B019EC9QK4,"Wasted potential, extremely wasted talent, and a cliche-ridden yawnfest of a plot.
The CGI is atrocious by the standards of late PS2 graphics, including the actual terrain in the film (was it seriously necessary to use green screen technology to put the characters in an empty field?)
The jokes almost always fall flat, not that it's even always clear what's supposed to be funny, as most of the humor in this film seems to consist of a character saying something generally mundane but with a smug look on his face. The only funny thing about the movie is the absurdity of its plot which is built on the flimsiest possible premise and uses the laziest and most cliched plot to deliver an ending so anticlimactic it manages to be disappointing even if you aren't invested in the story at all (and you won't be.)
The only good thing about this movie is James Marsters, who, sadly, seems to have been held in this movie against his will.",1510012800,2,934,4.598802395209581

7571173,5,B019EC9QK4,"Okay, it's cheesy and not serious at all, but it's funny.  If you liked movies like Spaceballs and Conan, this movie is for you.  The writing and acting is actually fun just because they throw in references and jokes all the time.",1509667200,,230,4.4523809523809526

Seeing this on my Prime feed I decided to give it a chance and was immediately drawn in to the quality production, a cast that really looks like they are having a great time and a plot that moves along nicely with some hysterically visual puns and great effects!  For me, a sign of a fun enjoyable movie is one that I immediately purchase in Bluray or DVD so that I have it in my permanent collection.  Dudes and Dragons is that kind of movie...give it a chance and it will win you over!  A fun night's fantasy hijinkery!!",1502841600,,674,4.325396825396825

I like cheesy B-grade movies, and I thought this was one, but it was missing most of the components of a grade B movie, i.e. awful CG, bad acting, and inconsistent scene/ plot progression.  Instead, this was a coherent, campy, irreverent, and oftentimes hilarious satire of adventure films.  The characters were plausible, the banter was excellent, the one-liners had me in tears, and the obvious well-placed ripoffs of other films were fantastically woven into the story... including a Star Wars scene that made me pause the video until I could stop laughing.

I'm sure all the d-bag college buddies who contributed to the Kickstarter fund to make this movie are very proud of themselves...But, there's a reason that not everyone who CAN make a movie, SHOULD...

It's great to find a movie in this genre that doesn't take itself so damn seriously (like Reign of Fire, Dragonheart, Dragonslayer, Labrynth, the list goes on and on). This film reminds me of the older, more traditional satires, such as Spaceballs, Army of Darkness and Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Low budget, and just silly fun.

This movie stays true to the gaming experience by completely disregarding actual distance and physics and inserting random encounters that distort and never support the storyline.  The writing is decent and from the out-takes in the credits i believe that the actors had a great deal of creative license.  At times I felt like the actors were trying to crack each other up as if they were in a SNL skit. And it worked for me.  I was fun and funny to watch the interactions between the characters.

Every thing about this movie is good for what they had to work with, the acting was good and no character was just throw in for a just because reason. Every character had depth to him and even the ones that were in there to be the funny ones had there monents to shine I found no joke to be cringe worth even the ones that poked at other movies. While the CGI aspects in them selves were avarage they way they combined the CG with the real aspects of the movie how every hides this fact making it greater as a whole, you can see they took the effort to do the best they could with what they had.

It took vision to make this movie... you can tell.  Very creative and really well cast.  Great effects!  Okay it's not ILM... but it services the movie just right!

Yes, it's low budget.  However, what this team pulled off is simply fantastic.  The ""hologram"" scene is worth the entire movie!!!

Those that fail to comprehend the farce in this masterpiece, must simply lack a sense of humor; I can think of no other explanation.

No language or nudity also makes for a fun family flick...but not for little kids.

Its not so great Id watch it all the way through without interruption. But it is amusing enough to watch which is more than I can say for most movies.

Naked Gun, Princess Bride, Men in Tights - if you liked those, youll like this enough.

It really didn't have the laughs, the fantasy was boring, and the story just didn't really do anything at all other than exist as it was.

I have no clue why so many people rated this 4 or 5 stars, but viewer beware.  Many other movies make similar references and do it better and with more laughs.  Or, in many other cases, with just as few number of laughs.",1457913600,,504,4.4945054945054945
7572040,4,B019EC9QK4,"This isn't a spoof, or a parody... this is a complete movie chock full of action and silliness.  While there are certainly nods to other films, this is not a string of takes on scenes from other movies like Scary Movie or films of that kind.  No, here the nods are well placed and sometimes actually quite epic.  There is a bit of dialogue during one of the nods which is absolute genius... I can't spoil it for you.  But to give you an idea of the humor, early in the movie a bystander witnesses the heroic strength and bravery of a knight and says ""wow, you really are as good as they say"" to which the hero replies ""yes, my reputation precedes me"".  If you get that, then you should enjoy this movie's humor.  On the stupid-funny scale of silliness, this is somewhere above Naked Gun but well below Quest for the Holy Grail.

The story line is inventive and the characters are interesting and well portrayed. There's generally good dialog throughout and the lack of subtitles and subsequent translation for the Orcish gibberish is well presented.  The actors all do a fine job and there's no one who leaves a scene feeling like it could have been delivered better.

Now, the special effects.  A lot of reviews criticize the effects harshly.  In contrast, I would say that they did an excellent job and obviously went through a lot of trouble to make the effects look ""bad"".  In some of the scenes with the dragon, it looks like it would have been easier to create a realistic, believable scene than it was to create something that reminded you that it was fake.  The result is a very ""80's"" movie feel to the effects which can only be intentional, and is extremely well executed.

All in all this is a fun movie that any fan of B-rated fantasy and action-comedy should be able to enjoy.",1457827200,27,1789,4.464615384615384
7572041,4,B019EC9QK4,"I have no idea how to rate or review this movie.

First, the issues:
It is completely ridiculous, the acting is horrible, the special effects are amateurish, and it feels like watching a bad episode of the Hercules tv show from the '90s.

Now for its good qualities:
It feels like watching a good episode of the Hercules tv show from the '90s!  I laughed more than a few times.  The actors put their best foot forward when delivering silly lines.  The plot has more soul than many movies I've seen.  This movie completely embraces its ridiculousness.  James Marsters manages to steal every scene he's in.

A for effort, B for execution.  Overall, 4 stars.",1457827200,13,655,4.626086956521739
7572042,4,B019EC9QK4,"Disclaimer I rented this movie elsewhere because it was not immediately obvious to me that I could stream it through Amazon. *Whoops*

That being said, the movie is actually good in its own way. Like if you go into it and just expect the effects to be ""so so"".. the acting is on page.. and
it's kind of like watching someone do a action role playing game.

You have four main characters. The ""Main hero"" the Blond guy in some armor where his nipples show. You have his ""helper"" who is an over weight ""Fabulous"" man..an orc, who kicks butt, but speaks no english, and a gruff and crude bounty hunter who is brother to the main guy. I don't know if it was supposed to mean anything but they have different hair-color, completely different. Different moms?

Anyways, the movie is good enough to where if you let your imagination go, you will get into. I Know there was one point about the 01:09:43 mark, where you learn/feel how incompetent the main blonde hero is.. quite frankly I was hoping he would get killed and the other characters would just say he died gloriously in battle.. because he makes such a screw up.. and then blames the bounty hunter for his mistake. It's so infuriating.

Ramicus lacks the social graces, is hairy, has an orc (Eric Denton)  sidekick, and is our voice of modern reason as he questions the ways of the Middle Earth. Camilan has a Samwise sidekick named Samton (Jake Van Wagoner).

The film spoofs LOTR and well as a few scenes from ""Titanic"" and ""Star Wars."" The names of the individuals were a laugh and indeed I has howling as the film began. Unfortunately like all satires of the genre, the comedy drops off as there seems to be a need to front load all the good material. Unlike LOTR this is almost entirely filmed in front of a green screen with fake backgrounds making this look like a western or 50's film. Considering this is a spoof, that is not a bad thing. One of the better LOTR spoofs. I liked it more than overly crude ""Your Highness.""

Best Feature Film DRAGON CON ATLANTA 2015

When a powerful wizard (James Marsters) vows to rid the land of love through the use of his firebreathing dragon, a brave team of eccentric warriors embark on a grand quest to break the curse, defeat the wizard, and slay his terrible beast.

Special Features:
* Bloopers
* BehindTheScenes Footage
* Deleted Scenes
* Visual Effects Featurette

DVD / Region: 1 / NOT RATED / Audio: English 5.1 Dolby Digital / Subtitles: English SDH / Format: 16x9 1.78 FF / Run Time: 114 Minutes /  Dragon Warrior LLC.  2016 Momentum Pictures LLC.
----------
Note: The blooper reel contains virtually all the material you see spliced into the end credits. There is really only one deleted scene, with a few deleted pieces thrown in. The behindthescenes footage & visual effects featurette are more like montages, but they do offer a look into the films creation.

Verdict: The movie is ridiculous & about a halfhour too long, but it does have its funny moments. The character of Shokdor the is quite comical though this schtick eventually wears thin. Erik Denton, who played this Orc, also appears (sans makeup) as the first person to speak in the film, a frightened villager. Lastly, Luke Perry has a very tongueincheek cameo.

Rating: Upon its own merits, I would give it 3stars, but it deserves an additional star for marital payback. Priceless!",1456963200,10,1979,4.8486646884272995
