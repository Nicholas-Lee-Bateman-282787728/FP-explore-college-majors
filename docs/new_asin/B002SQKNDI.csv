8379494,4,B002SQKNDI,"Painstaking and interesting account of a shameful incident. This NZ film makes amends for an old wrong. In the hysteria of the McCarthy pursuit of US film people, the small country of New Zealand deprived itself of a capable and dedicated film worker. Cecil Holmes moved to Australia, made two feature films in the 1950s, wrote scripts for others and produced a string of documentaries, many of a social awareness nature.

This documentary film is soberly made with informative interviews, one with Holmes near the end of his life. Informs (or reminds) us of the poisonous politics of that Cold War period. In effect, a warning that artists and thinkers may be caught up in petty political manipulation to detriment of their careers, stressing of their lives and serious loss for culture and public understanding. Holmes' widow, Elizabeth, published in 2004 a memoir: 'Mr Holmes Has Left' gives valuable insight into the period and the man.

The 1955-released, but now near-lost, feature film 'Captain Thunderbolt' was made central to a session at the 2010 Sydney Film Festival on Australia's Lost Films. To the extent that it may still be viewed, it shows Holmes to be a vigorous film director in a forceful style derived from the classics and honorably so.",1273449600,3,1258,4.985714285714286
