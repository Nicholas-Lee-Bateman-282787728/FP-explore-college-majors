1652415,5,B00005R1NQ,"This is NOT the best Fulci film out there if you are expecting gore galore, but it is definetly worth a look for the die-hard fans of the Maestro. Casual viewers of Fulci's films may not care for it much, if you are expecting lots of the latter. This is one of Fulci's last films, only to be followed by Door to Silence (1992). You've probably read the reviews about what the movie contains and don't contain, or at least are about to read it, so i won't go into details. But for myself, I thought it was a very good movie. It had a good dialogue, decent acting, and a great ending. I highly recommend it to the legion of Italian Horror buffs out there, to add it to your collection. One more thing to another reviewer named HENRY HUECK who is writing some of the reviews for this and other movies. I don't know how old you are, but please man, please, LEARN HOW TO FRIGGIN SPELL AND WORD THINGS CORRECTLY, WILL YA? Do you have spell check, or someone else to do your writing? It's like reading from a 2nd graders essay report or something. JEEZ!!!!. Anyway, to all the gore gore girls and boys out there. CIAO!!!",1042156800,10,1113,4.279620853080568

1652417,5,B00005R1NQ,"Giorgio, a ""wealthy, middle-aged businessman,"" comes home late one night, drinks a bit, and then decides to join his wife. As the evening progresses, he begins to hemorrhage suddenly, developing some nasty ""puddle of blood"" coughing fits and, in the hospital later, dies. Death, however, doesn't bring Giorgio rest because of mysterious circumstances of his death and his general distrust of all his family/mistress/etc. Enter his daughter, returning from college to attend her father's funeral, who just happens to be the only person Giorgio ever cared for and the only person that can help him find out who was responsible for his demise. It isn't too terribly easy, though, because everyone in his life seems to be rather disturbed.
Voices From Beyond isn't, by any means, your atypical Fulci movie. While there is a level of horror (most occurring in dreams) and a bit of gore, this is more of a ""who done it"" murder/mystery than anything.  There are a lot of dream sequences, an autopsy scene, and a child finding the wrong end of the blade, but the purpose of the movie is to find out who killed our main character, Giorgio. Personally, I liked the way the movie ended and I liked some of the situations within, but I also have to say that it isn't for everyone.  I would only recommend buying without first checking it out to fans of all things Lucio.",1021766400,4,1358,4.75
1652418,3,B00005R1NQ,"This film had a good beginning, a soap opera middle, and a good ending, but lacked murders or gore which is the norm for a Lucio Fulci flick. The way the character at the beginning was murdered was quite ingenious.
A worthy addition to the Fulci collection.",1016409600,2,257,4.48936170212766
7951452,5,B00005R1NQ,"Very nasty and entertaining early 90s yuppie-fear-thriller era drama from Fulci. Where else can you see a movie open with an angry father having angry feverish sex getting angry at his crying son in another room, matching in and stabbing this 5 year old boy to death. All shown in graphic death. This is pulpy soap opera Fulci at his most bitter, vicious and bloody.
Fulci was a valued-director--he could deliver under austere-conditions, and with over-50 films, his ""hit-ratio"" is surprisingly-high. He was cheap, and he usually delivered a solid-film with so little. Always remember that a majority of his films were made for under $1 million, and you begin to understand how truly-great he was as a director, a veritable-magician. People who compare other films by a director aren't worth listening-to, because people and times change. Yes, the films are frozen, but why should we be frozen too? Voices From Beyond is well-worth repeated-viewings, and almost totally-forgotten. Sure, it isn't his best film, but it's pretty darned good. It teaches us that we can let-go of the deceased, since they are always with us anyway. Long-live Lucio Fulci's legacy!",1523059200,,1159,5.105263157894737
7951453,4,B00005R1NQ,"VOICES FROM BEYOND (1991) opens w/ a ""bang"" (in more ways than one!). An erotic dream sequence, also containing the bloody murder of a child, gets our attention immediately. Then, we watch as Giorgio Mainardi (Duilio Del Prete) dies, spitting up blood like a fountain! It's clear, this is a Lucio Fulci film, and we haven't even gotten to the over-the-top-gory autopsy yet! We quickly learn that some in Giorgio's extended family won't be missing him very much! His stony-hearted sister Hilda (Frances Nacmen) and her greedy, gutless son, Mario (Pascal Persiano) are especially happy to be shed of him! Enter Rosy (Karina Huff), Giorgio's daughter. She's one relative who actually loved this guy. She's also got her own suspicions about the cause of her father's demise. In addition, Giorgio's disembodied voice has been wondering when someone would be looking into this very subject! At Giorgio's funeral, the possible motives of several ""loved ones"" are on display via flashback. While Giorgio's voice calls out from beyond the grave, Rosy is his only hope for justice. Unless, of course, we count Giorgio's mute, paralyzed father, whom everyone simply ridicules or ignores.  As a later Fulci film, VOICES is better and more cohesive than others of this period. Aside from the usual ultra-gore and beaucoup nudity, there are some interesting elements, like the supernatural contact through dreams, which is reminiscent of his earlier movie, FROM BEYOND. In fact, there are several cool dream sequences that draw from Fulci's past canon, containing everything from rotting zombies to eyeball pasta! Fulci even shows Giorgio's corpse over time, in worsening states of putrefaction. The story itself is solid and engaging. Another positive aspect is the Rosy character, who is both strong and inquisitive. Now, this is by no means a perfect movie. There are some glaring flaws and cheeezey parts, and the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying. However, it's still a good Fulci film...",1522540800,2,1979,5.2037617554858935
7951454,4,B00005R1NQ,"I decided to comment on this in particular film after viewing it for the first time, and after reading some very contrasting views about it.

This is a 1991 mystery movie directed by Italian director Lucio Fulci, clearly better known (and appreciated by many) by his gore films. The story here is not entirely original, but good enough to keep viewers interest in my view. A powerful business man dies after arriving to a hospital facing a hemorrhagic condition. His spirit returns to aid his daughter in finding his killers. Several people provide good suspects, including his widow, his lover, and other political relatives.

As some reviewers indicate, this movie lacks the gore of other Fulci movies. However, Voices from Beyond works just well enough without much of that. In fact, this movie relies highly on a logically connected story, high quality of dialogs (without the non sense dialogs of most Fulci gore movies), and very descent acting. I really enjoy Fulci films heavy on gore, particularly his notorious zombie films, but the connection between scenes and dialogs in these films just suck. So, I got really amused after watching this one and realizing that a good story can be combined with good acting and dialogs that make sense. I highly recommend this film to viewers if they value these features and are aware that gore is rather absent here.

Technically, the DVD transfer by RED CODE is very good. The image comes in widescreen format, and runs for 91 min, the complete film according to IMDB. This is a region free release. Audio comes in English with no subtitles. The edition comes with absolutely no extras, not even a menu.",1479686400,,1652,4.871886120996441
7951455,5,B00005R1NQ,"Voices From Beyond is a lesser-known, late-era Fulci gem. This one is special. Unique. It's for fans who appreciate that the maestro had more to offer than just ""gore and ghouls"". If you truly believe that, you just must dig this one. It's a gore-less, ghostly tale stuffed with rich atmosphere, dark emotion, and despicable characters motivated by money and power. There are themes of loss and death, fractured family values, pride, karma, and revenge. Oh, and the score is pretty solid.

(No spoilers here but) Initially, my only problem with the movie was the ending, which feels way less powerful than expected, but makes more sense when one considers what the main character's motivation was all along. So if you've seen all of Fulci's more accessible features and you're hungering for a deeper representation of his talents, then you need to get this into your collection ASAP. Not only is this Shriek Show release OOP, but it's a decent transfer with some sweet cover art to boot.",1461974400,,987,4.875
7951456,1,B00005R1NQ,"First let me say I enjoy a lot of films buy Lucio Fulci, even ones people don't normally like, for example The New York Ripper & Cat in the Brain. That said Voices from Beyond is really one of his worst films. Aside from the nudity & some gore as another reviewer said it does seem like a made for TV movie. The plot is a man dies, his spirit  communicates with his daughter to try & find the killer. There are many suspects in the family. The is very little gore when compared to other Fulci films & very little violence except in bizarre dream sequences. The story really drags on a lot during the film & was a bit bored by the 40 min mark. Usually I can at least find something I like in horror films, especially films by Fulci but I just couldn't find anything positive in this one except in 1 nightmare sequence that had zombies in it. If you are a really huge fan of his work & absolutely MUST see everything he's directed, that's the only way I could recommend this. If you just enjoy his more well know stuff like Zombie, The Beyond, City of the Living, House by the Cemetery then skip this one. There are no special features on the Blu Ray either.",1447459200,,1156,4.183856502242152
7951457,4,B00005R1NQ,"I like this films for it's surreal-like qualities that you can only get in a Fulci film... Haunting atmosphere, paranoid characters, ghostly ambiance, eerie music... One my favorites from the Italian director.",1396656000,,209,5.5625
7951458,2,B00005R1NQ,"As soon as the head of the family has died (apparently of unnatural causes), he starts talking in this echoey voice, very concerned with finding his killer.  This continues off and on throughout the rest of the movie, with him talking from beyond the grave to his daughter Rosy and sometimes to the air itself it seems.  The way this is carried out is laughable, almost worthy of MST3K-level ridicule.

The rest of the plot can be described as ""As The Fulci Turns"", since it's nothing more than a glorified soap opera whodunnit with slimy family members of all sorts, each with a credible motive for commiting the murder.  Calling this a horror film is a bit of a stretch.  If it wasn't for the gore and nudity this could be a very bad TV movie (just listen for the dance music in the background during the lengthy funeral scene!).  While the autopsy scene is convincing enough, the child's torso and the corpse's decay are not realistic at all (the former because it looks so fake and the latter because as far as I know a corpse doesn't decay down to mere bones in the span of a few days).  And then there is the soft focus style this film was shot with.  It works in the context of the dream sequences but it's also used outside of those so there is no consistency to the effect.  It can certainly be hard on the eyes at times.

I don't understand the relatively high status this film has received in the Fulci canon.  In all honesty it's a chore to sit through with very little payoff.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the generous amounts of topless female nudity.  This can often make sitting through a truly awful film somewhat more bearable.  Since there are way better Fulci films out there than this one, Voices From Beyond is more of an insult to his legacy and reputation than anything else.",1384041600,,1836,4.4094955489614245
7951459,3,B00005R1NQ,"I have yet to see this film, but it will soon be released by Code Red on Blu-Ray and available for purchase through their site.",1376870400,,127,4.12
7951460,4,B00005R1NQ,"Okay, we Fulci fans have our personal favorites, mine being ""Zombie,"" ""House by the Cemetery,"" and ""City of the Living Dead""... For me, ""Voices From Beyond"" was definitely a departure, but then again, I have always appreciated the Maestro's work, even if others haven't. I even enjoyed ""Four of the Apocalypse."" It wasn't as atmospheric and eerie as I was led to believe, but I give Fulci credit for what he tried to do - to entertain us.",1367798400,,438,4.628205128205129
7951461,3,B00005R1NQ,"I like Fulci films of the 70's and early 80's (basically through Manhattan Baby) but for some reason from his dismal fantasy epic Conquest in 1985 on his films are, for the most part, bad. Voices From Beyond isn't necessarily bad but it is very passable.

This film, much like Fulci's TV Movie House of Clocks, really acts like an Italian Twilight Zone episode stretched out to feature length done Fulci style. Here we get a very rich family whose father dies a mysterious death. The father talks to himself (even though he's dead) throughout most of the film trying to figure out his murderer. His favorite daughter (who's the same actress from the film House of Clocks...and a fine looker I might add) visits for the funeral and her dead father communicates to her that he's been murdered and wants her to find the killer.

The story (written by Fulci) is a tired weak formula and overall this really feels like a TV made film. I'm most certain if it was made for TV as it does have nudity but it does have the same feel as house of Clocks. Also like many of Fulci's later works this movie was filmed with soft lenses giving the film a white hue, or a hazy look. I hate this soft lense look that dominated Italian cinema in the late 80's and early 90's as it cheapens the look of the film. Perhaps Fulci thought it gave his films ""dreamy"" or ""surreal"" look but it just gets old. Unless you are a die-hard Fulci fanatic, I would think twice about paying the high price. Though Image Entertainment does a good job at mastering this little seen film they failed to deliver any special features what-so-ever. I personally just found the film to be kind of blah and it lacks the grander look and appeal of his early films that even the weaker Manhattan Baby contained.

On a side note, horror fans might find it of interest that Fulci thanks Clive Barker in the end credits.",1138320000,4,1871,4.448979591836735
