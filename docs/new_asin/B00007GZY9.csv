7976460,3,B00007GZY9,"its a good movie but if your not big into a slow going doc, you can see the majority of the good parts on youtube, either way tho if your a collector of good car movies, definitely a must for your collection",1341792000,,207,3.9523809523809526
7976461,4,B00007GZY9,"Watching this allows the viewer to join a group of drivers for a tip across the country (Gumball Ralley) without the cost of an entry fee, lack of sleep, or paying for tickets.  We are introduced to some of the characters that will make the pilgramage ala&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cannonball-Run/dp/B002N57KG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cannonball Run</a>&nbsp;as they leave NYC and trek to Nashville (913 mi) everybody seems to have cameras.  We see at one stop the gas price of... $1.32, in 2002.  We see cars pulled over.

along the way they stop in Washington DC at Union Station, the word is stated. We see a Reynolds wrap truck that was in a wreck, no mention if it was due to the ralley.

In an aside we watch a guy jumping his Saturn over speed bumps in a parking lot, (hmmm).

Back at the ralley we see people passing on the right side of the road! We see/hear radar detectors going off, the police try to stop them all,. then just let them go. A guy 'says' he has 8 tickets.  A BMW wagon gets run off the road for passing on the right shoulder.

We see where a bird has flown into the grill of a car. One guy gets a ticket for 187 MPH, another gets one for 75 in a 70. One guy gets a ticket for rolling through a stop sign. A driver trys to call 911 on Police weaving through traffic, the number is busy.  The Police put a plane in the air.

Another aside is a drifting contest, again, not by Gumballers.

Someone puts diesel fuel in their car and has to drain it out.

People use binoculars to try to spy police.

At the end driver interviews that say it was the best thing they have ever done.",1333756800,,1663,4.503333333333333
7976462,4,B00007GZY9,"The film represents a good overall view of the annual Gumball Rally 3000

it is as good as ""Gumball 3000 6 Days In May"" but not as good as the ""Gumball 3000 The Movie"".",1173398400,,168,3.9411764705882355
7976463,5,B00007GZY9,This was a great movie and had a great mix of cars. Very fun too watch especially the Sony video tape part. Coulda had more bad behavior like the parking lot scenes at the end but was still a great movie that entertained me the entire time. bought Redline with this and it sucked. Dont Buy Redline unless you was to see no cars and just girls.,1099267200,2,343,4.134328358208955
7976464,5,B00007GZY9,"This Video is great it focus mostly on the cannonball run which is great but is missing some of the crazy stuff that was in the first video like auto abuse, mischief destroy is even better because it mixs the two together the rally and the reckless stuff, and Mischief Invasion is the best with dados new turbo m3 just wish he could have taken it on the rally. I own all FOur Of the videos in the series love them all and watch them all the time and cant wait for the next one.",1089676800,4,477,4.031578947368421
7976465,5,B00007GZY9,"This DVD is fun, shows amazing cars and show a lifetime experience race. It is really fun and exciting if you into cars and cannonball races. Reza is the man with his 360 Spyder... Keep doing your thing playa... Holla at your boy!!!!!!",1086220800,,235,4.488372093023256
7976466,1,B00007GZY9,"If you want to see Cannonball Run stuff, you'll get it. But most of the participants in this documentary drive and act like completely irresponsible idiots. If you want to learn and understand about the true ideal of the Cannonball Baker Memorial Trophy Dash, read Brock Yates book, Cannonball! Real people who take long run, high speed performance driving seriously (and have fun) while focusing on not endangering anyone's life... I was disappointed in the extreme, because until I saw this video, I thought the Gumball 3000 looked like a great idea, and something I wanted to do...",1081123200,4,584,4.969387755102041
7976467,5,B00007GZY9,"Ok this film is footage is from something known as the Gumball Rally whitch is a rally that goes from the East coast to the West coast in 5 days and is a total of 3000 miles long.
In this video you will tons of Exsotic Cars. theres everything from 60's corvettes all the way up to a Ferrari F-50. All being put threw there paces.
In addion to this there are serveral chapters that reflect on the previous Mischife Video thats shows your althenic street racing.
ALso includes footage from the Car and Driver Super Tuner challenge. whitch includes cars such as the Autothoirty Stage 5 911 turbo, and the 800hp Linginfelter Corvette.
And this whole video is set to yet another great soundtrack consisting of Punk Rock and the very best Trance/Techno you'll hear.
Hope this helps....",1068249600,4,779,4.611510791366906
