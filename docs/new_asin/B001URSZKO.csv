8344871,5,B001URSZKO,"This production is from the 2000 Sferisterio Opera Festival in Macerata, Italy. It's an outdoor theater like a modern amphitheater. Although I didn't see any microphones, the sound was excellent.
While the performers were fine singers, the attitude was less operatic and more focused on the personal interactions between the characters. That's a benefit often found in Italian regional opera: in a smaller house it's not necessary to oversing to be heard, and it worked well in the Tosca from the Torre del Lago Puccini festival, also on the Dynamic label.
The Carmen, Nino Surguladze, is in her late 20s and has a dramatic soprano voice that she doesn't push. She has the appearance and movements of a Penelope Cruz. She acts like she knows the score and how serious life can be, but a Gypsy can always find a way thru things, so why not have fun? Being a sexual predatoru is just part of the game.
Her Don Jose, Philippe Do, is Asian with a reedy lyric tenor voice that strengthens as the opera progresses. He sees his maturity, his organization, his world slip away as Carmen's tentacles trap him and he responds with obsession. His voice, which seems a bit wimpy at first, gains bite and gravitas as he is swallowed by obsession.
The Escamillo, Simone Alberghini, is well known in Italy, is made less of a macho charicaturization than usual, but one who might have been strong enough to withstand Carmen, had she lived.
The setting here seems to be in the 1920s, pre-Franco, but that's secondary, there are no political messages here, kust clues left by clothing and accessories. The stage is easily adapted to the various settings and feels natural.
Since this festival is a local effort by Macerata (east of Rome, near the east coast) there are plenty of extras, who do a fine job. At the end the stage was filled by extras, many more than any opera house house could fit or afford (well, maybe not Salzburg.)
In my notes, I mention excellent 5.1 sound, natural bass pickup, and that little camera time is given to the orchestra.
I reviewed, and did not love the Zurich Carmen with Kasarova. I reviewed and did love the Covent Garden and MET productions, but they were full-out operatic productions.
The singing is fine here, but it is also a bit more theatrical and that works in developing the characters and the story.
I hope you will take the opportunity to see this production.",1412726400,,2388,4.701670644391408
