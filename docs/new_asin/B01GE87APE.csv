7759317,5,B01GE87APE,"Rented this from Netflix over the weekend, watched it twice, not sure which time I enjoyed it more, its a wonderful animated tale. Theres a very fleeting moment at the end, one notable redclad scientist remarks to another, in an extremely poignant fusion of Kurt Vonnegut & J. Robert Oppenheimer

Science has known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose

7759318,5,B01GE87APE,An excellent adventure. Taking place in early 20th century France in an alternate timeline April and the extraordinary world is a great movie. The animation is very good. I started out watching the English dub then about 30 minutes into the film switched to French with subtitles and liked it much better than the dub.,1470614400,2,318,4.8
7759319,5,B01GE87APE,Great story. The artwork was very good!! It May not be Japanese Anime artwork but it's good. The story and artwork is French type Anime. It's about early 20th century.  It's about a girl trying to fined her family.,1470441600,3,214,4.487179487179487

7759324,5,B01GE87APE,"Full disclosure: I went in watching April & the Extraordinary World with very little knowledge about the plot. But I was rewarded by leaving the theater both impressed and surprised by this foreign animated film's ambitions. There's a lot that April & the Extraordinary World has to say about the world, and its fast-paced story does so with excellent visuals, colorful characters, and wonderfully manic humor throughout. So if you want the best viewing experience, I'd suggest stopping at this paragraph, ignoring any detailed plot summaries online, and buying this movie!

Its main premise revolves around a rewritten history of the world where coal is still the basis for energy in the 1940s, and electricity has yet to be harvested. With so much coal powering every piece of technology, the world is riddled in cloudy skies and all-around pollution, and greenery is virtually nonexistent. Don't worry, though; the environmental message is very subtle, at best. Instead, the reason why coal is the primary source of energy is because the scientists who would've prevented this predicament aren't around to do so. This, in simplified form, is the giant mystery of the plot.

Two of those missing scientists are the parents of April Franklin, the titular character of the movie, and part of a family full of scientific pioneers. Before her main adventures as an adult, we see a young April witness her parents actually disappear, and she presumes them dead. Ten years later, after concocting a liquid to revive her dying, talking cat (more on my favorite character later), she stumbles upon a way to find them, her grandfather Pops, and figure out just what exactly is causing all these brilliant minds to suddenly disappear from the public eye. This leads April to a discovery that could threaten the entire human race.

Having watched this film, there are a few delightful parallels between April & Extraordinary World and the works of Hayao Miyazaki. All the visual machinery will remind you of films like Spirited Away and Howls Moving Castle, while its whimsical moments compare to those seen in pretty much anything that Miyazaki has given to the world. While the films plot moves quick with dialogue, exposition, twists and turns, this only complements all the steampunk weirdness and fun chaos seen onscreen. April is an admirably strong female protagonist, and her supporting cast makes following these characters all the more enjoyable. One gripe I have with the film is the somewhat forced romance between April and Julius, a petty thief who ends up falling for April and joining her on the adventure. Because theres not really any dialogue that serves as evidence of their supposed chemistry, and because half of the time they are at each others throats, this subplot just feels obligatory. This romantic coupling wouldve been unearned, if it weren't for the quietly beautiful last frames of the film.

April & the Extraordinary World was developed and financed primarily in France, and is originally presented in the French language, with Marion Cotillard voicing April Franklin. When this film was released in the U.S., there was also an English language version sans Cotillard. Both versions are included in the physical release (evidenced by the back cover image and the press release by Studio Canal). However, it's not clear if the included Ultraviolet Digital Copy will have both language tracks.

The English language cast includes Canadian voice actress Angela Galuppo now voicing April, Paul Giamatti playing Pizoni, a Paris cop obsessed with finding and unraveling the Franklin family, and Buster Bluth/Tony Hale playing Darwin, April's wise-cracking lovable cat who, by circumstance, is the most invincible character in the movie. I personally found Darwin more fun to watch when voiced by his French counterpart, Philippe Katerine, but you can hear for yourself. Notably, J.K. Simmons and Susan Sarandon also lend their voices in the English version, but to reveal their characters would spoil the big mystery of the film.

Which version is better? Its subjective, but the good news is that both are available with this physical copy, so you can judge for yourself. Be aware that the films screenplay was made with the French language in mind, so there are certainly jokes in the English version that don't land as well as in the original French language track. This, however, does nothing to ruin the experience of the movie. Its unfortunate that this film didn't get a wider theatrical release stateside, but its availability on Blu-Ray and DVD will help this film garner the legacy it deserves. Its hard to call April & Extraordinary World better than your average Miyazaki film, but this animated gem is certainly extraordinary in its own right.",1465776000,43,4775,5.1075544174135725

7759330,3,B01GE87APE,"This animation was not at all what I expected. I would say this is not for small children. I'd say at like 4-5th graders. The story is somewhat original for the types of stories out now. It all takes place in mid war France where April's parents are scientists. The experimentation they show can be kind of rough. The rest of the movie also has April trying to fend for herself as an orphan girl in France while she tries to carry on her parents work. She does have contact with a grandfather, her wisely talking cat yet is being chased by war police. There is no harsh language. The silence is mild but the story is unusual. I don't know if I'll watch this again. Plus the animation style was not of the quality I was expecting.",1512172800,2,729,4.2898550724637685
7759331,5,B01GE87APE,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I had been wanting to see it for a long time. I finally sat down and watched it the other night and was completely blown away by the imagination, originality, and and storytelling. It is everything I love in a movie. Also, the animation style is so unique and refreshing. Most animated films I see nowadays are CGI so seeing a unique style of traditional animation was fun and really makes the film stand out in my opinion. The alternate history, and steampunk setting is fantastic too! I wish there were more steampunk movies of this quality. And I don't want to give anything away, but the story was fabulous. It had everything I love in a movie, a strong female lead, a sassy talking cat, what more can you ask for? The story definitely gave me a bit of a Studio Ghibli vibe, and totally delivered on quality of the story in every area including character development, plot structure, and how it handled the climax and denouement. They really followed through with the story's themes right through to the end and I have a lot of respect for that. It was fun and surprising. I honestly didn't know how it was going to end, and I loved it. Definitely recommend to any fans of steampunk or animation!",1510704000,,1250,4.4868421052631575

7759335,4,B01GE87APE,"Created as an international production between Belgian, Canadian, and French studios, this full-length animated movie is done as one of the few steampunk stories that takes place outside of the normal given boundaries of the average points in time that would normally carry over into the ""deiselpunk"" era. Inspired by the artworks of cartoonist Jacque, this is an original story that spans decades set in an alternate history version of Europe.

Beginning in 1870, Napoleon the 3rd comes to inspect a new weapon his leading scientist Gustave Franklin, but instead of his army of super ape soldiers he was hoping for, Nappy III gets a pair of super-intelligent reptiles(possibly dinosaurs). In his anger, Napoleon causes a lab accident leading to his own premature death along with Gustav Franklin. Over the next few decades, several different ""Napoleons"" take up the leadership of France, while the rest of the world suffers from having their most brilliant scientists go missing. Due to this, there were no World Wars, and mankind's technology has been reduced to a slow pace with still relying on producing steam. In 1931, Gustav's grandson Pops along with his own grandson Paul, Paul's wife Annette, and their daughter April, have created special elixir which gave their cat Darwin that enables him the powers of speech and human intelligence. However, the French government is rounding up every scientist they can to bolster their arsenal, and track the Franklins down to their secret hideout, which has Pops going missing, and April's parents seemingly disintegrated by a bizarre thundercloud that chased them. Cut to 1941 where April has been living in secret on her own with Darwin. Meanwhile, a French policeman is tracking April down for any connection to her family, and using a vagrant pickpocket named Julius to do his legwork for him. Julius ends up falling for April, and joins her after she finally gets word that her parents are still alive, along with reuniting with her grandfather Pops as they unite to try to find out the conspiracy of the missing scientists, all while being chased by the French government.

The animation in this has its own unique style of animation and the look of the characters, very reminiscent of The Adventures Of Tintin, while blending in the feel of The Extraordinary Adventures of Adle Blanc-Sec comic that also got its own French-created live-action movie. Those who have seen A Cat In Paris should be familiar with the quirky style of storytelling that usually goes into a European high adventure/chase plot when it comes to this film. It makes for an interesting all-ages movie to, featuring American voice actors like Susan Sarandon, J.K. Simmons, and Paul Giamatti, even though they are mainly playing supporting characters. For real makes for an excellent entry in any steampunk movie marathon!",1499385600,,2849,5.098501070663811

I liked it a lot. The story is original, positive, interesting, and character relationships are not like those of every other movie. It's for older kids or adults. The plot moves in understandable yet weird ways that keep the viewer from being bored.  The animation quality is excellent, in a steampunk style... Think Howl's Moving Castle Or Inspector Gadget visual style. And it must of made quite an impression on me because last night I dreamt I was conversing with an elephant, thinking how smart elephants must be. Funny. The movie features some scientificly enhanced intelligent animals. It also features a good family, across generations, complete with its complex messes and triumphs.

7759389,4,B01GE87APE,"The animated French family film April and the Extraordinary World will have your imagination doing somersaults and cartwheels.

Adapted from the steampunk graphic novel by cartoonist and author Tardi, this exquisitely crafted, wondrously original treasure is set in an alternate universe where electricity was never invented and people have to power their lives with steam.

It's a version of 20th-century France where neither technology nor democracy ever took root and is the second film adaptation of Tardi's fanciful work. (Director Luc Besson made a winning live-action epic of his graphic novel series The Extraordinary Adventures of Adle Blanc-Sec.)

Set in the 1930s and 1940s, April and the Extraordinary World gives us a Paris filled with goofy-looking airships, chubby cable cars, televisions that run on charcoal, and cars with big, copper-colored chimneys that look as if they were made in 1905.

There has been no scientific innovation for more than 50 years because the world's greatest eggheads have all been abducted by an unknown power. Those who remain have been enlisted by the emperor Napoleon V to help win France's bloody energy war with Canada over the New World's coal mines and forests.

The story focuses on a decadelong quest by a teenage rebel scientist named April (Marion Cotillard) to find her abducted scientist parents. Things are looking dire: Her only friend, Darwin (Philippe Katerine), a talking cat who homeschooled April, is getting older and sicker every day.

The premise is wildly fantastical, even mad, yet the filmmakers create this crazy world with such awesome attention to detail, such conviction, and such emotional force that the movie draws you in right from its opening screen and holds you in its thrall.

It will delight kids while slyly subverting adults' assumptions about the inherent goodness of Western civilization. Before you know it, you realize you're watching a parable about allowing our fear of our neighbors to turn science into a tool for oppression rather than a creative force for good.

You can take or leave the political message. You don't need it to fall in love with April and the Extraordinary World and revel in its sheer beauty.",1472515200,,2206,5.176966292134831
7759390,5,B01GE87APE,"Just finished watching ""April And The Extraordinary World"" released by Universal.
""April And The Extraordinary World"" is a refreshing French anime movie that takes place in an alternative history where the Great Industrial Revolution fizzled and history took a steam powered twist.  Set against this backdrop in Paris 1941 is a world where scientists live in fear of being discovered and seized to be put to work for the good of protecting France by building military weapons.
Against this back drop are April's parents and grandfather who are working to create an ultimate serum that can make people immortal and indestructible.  A police raid forces them to flee; but April is soon separated from her parents when the airship they were escaping in explodes by an unknown agent.
Spending 10 years in hiding, April is desperate to recreate the ultimate serum in order to save Darwin's - her beloved cat's life.  She succeeds and soon is plunged into solving the mystery of how her parents disappeared and who is behind the renewed attempt to capture her.
A totally enchanting and engrossing movie with beautiful animation.
Highly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1472428800,9,1154,5.095238095238095
7759391,4,B01GE87APE,"I knew nothing about this movie but the description caught my eye and I'm all for finding interesting-sounding movie.  I'm also for stepping out of my comfort zone when it comes to movies that came from other countries.  I tend to watch anime from Japan and not movies from Europe.....and especially not from France lest I get labeled a pervert because.....well France

This movie takes place in an alternate timeline where we kept steam power and it is a steampunk setting.  Thanks to a botched experiment making animals into super soldiers.....as you do...There's a talking cat owned by April who's looking for her parents who were seemingly killed by a strange cloud

The mystery is what drives this movie and the animation is magnificent.  One of the more unique movies I ever saw",1472428800,,784,4.857142857142857

8762735,2,B01GE87APE,"Honestly, it didn't keep my attention and the plot line was blah. I felt like there were too many cliche things (girl is abnormal/unaccepted by others, girl doesn't trust guys, starts to fall for a guy during story, guy betrays her, etc). The main characters weren't really likeable either.

I was excited for a unique and charming story when I bought this, especially with the high ratings and the unique art style. But in reality, it was not really special or different from any other movies already out there. I wouldn't put it on the same shelf as Miyazaki films either.

I enjoyed the art style and steampunk aesthic, but that's about it. I really don't understand how it's rated so highly",1532131200,2,694,4.680327868852459
