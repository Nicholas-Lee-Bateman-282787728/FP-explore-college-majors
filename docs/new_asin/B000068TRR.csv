1726673,3,B000068TRR,"Farscape suffers from the lack of competition on sci-fi television. Most everything is really bad these days, so Farscape is near the top of the trash heap. That does not make it great. Some episodes are great, but then the writing or character development goes south and the show falters in a big way. Stargate SG1 is better written, but it has to be- relying more on the dialog than costumes and special effects than Farscape. What I really hope for is ""strange frame""- a show that is well written and based on some sort of science, not fantasy- I mean both Farscape and Stargate rely on the improbablilty of traveling through a matter-crushing worm hole- hardly original and hardly science fiction.",1025654400,2,701,4.754098360655738

1726677,5,B000068TRR,"No, ""Farscape"" is not yet being put into full season sets, but this is a vast improvement. As the plan goes now, a new 2-disc set will be released each month, with 4-5 episodes on each. And that's much better than only 2 episodes, every few months, as we've previously been getting.
""Farscape"" is, bar none, the best science-fiction on TV. It's daring, bold, insane, whimsical, scary, and fun...and also has one of the most complex, involving, and brilliant mythologies of any sci-fi out there, including some fascinating stuff about wormholes.
With that said, on to the episode reviews...
""Mind the Baby"" is an excellent season-opener that picks up from the season finale with a punch, and leads the show into its new direction for the new year. Its only weakness is the fact that it was not originally meant to be the season-opener, but the second episode. The first one was aired later in the season, and turned into a flashback episode, where we find out what happened. Therefore, some of the aspects of the previous season finale cliffhanger are strangely resolved without an explanation...Although that explanation will be given later in the season, in the episode, ""Dream a Little Dream.""
The next 2 episodes, unfortunately, are not the best ""Farscape"" has to offer. ""Taking the Stone"" and ""Vitas Mortis"" are both rather slow, unexciting episodes. Although each focuses on a different character and provides some great, sometimes crucial, character development, the actual stories don't pack the right amount of punch. That is not to say that they are not worth watching. Just they are not as good as they should have been.
The fourth episode of the set, however, is the crown jewel of the 4, and completely makes up for the minor weaknesses of ""Mind the Baby"" and the more serious ones of the other two. ""Crackers Don't Matter"" is an utterly brilliant, demented, hilarious, black comedy that strikes a perfect balance between the dark and the funny. It is one of the best episodes the show has ever done. It's impossible to describe the episode without giving it away, but, suffice it to say, it is brillant on every level: character-wise, plot-wise, comedy-wise, drama-wise...Very few shows can produce an episode that can make you laugh till it hurts, and cringe, also. It also greatly benefits from being an episode with a stand-alone plot which also speaks a great deal aobut the characters, and foreshadows the major story arc of the year, something that won't come completely into focus and be fully revealed until much later in the year, in the ingenious ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" which will take away its crown as the best episode up to that point.
What is great about ""Farscape"" is how it always manages to top itself. Therefore, ""Crackers Don't Matter"" was the best episode for a while, until ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" took its place, which was then taken by the season finale, ""Die Me Dichotomy."" And that doesn't even factor in the two brilliant trilogies: ""Look at the Princess"" and ""Liars, Guns, and Money."" Wow, you people who have never seen this season before are in for a real treat...!!!",1023062400,52,3113,4.864406779661017
1726678,3,B000068TRR,"Orignally, Farscape's Season 2 Premiere episode was one called ""Re: Union"".  However, it was decided before the second season aired that the second episode they had filmed, ""Mind the Baby"", would make a more appropriate season premiere (they aired ""Re: Union"" later in the season as ""Dream a Little Dream"", with a few new scenes to make it a story in flashback).
""Mind the Baby"" was certainly much better suited to be the season premiere episode.  It picks up after Crichton and D'Argo have been rescued from floating in space by Aeryn (where they were left at the end of Season 1).  They are hiding from the Peacekeepers at an abandoned mining facility on an asteroid.  Aeryn makes supplies runs in her Prowler, but is secretly rendevouzing with someone on these trips.  In the meantime, the rest of Moya's crew is trying to find Crichton, Aeryn, and D'Argo, and so is Scorpius and his command carrier.  They will all collide in a good episode, though one that is a bit rushed in its plot.
""Vitas Mortis"", the second episode on the tape, is a very mediocre episode about D'Argo's encounter with a Luxan holy woman on a planet.  She will manipulate D'Argo into helping her, but these actions will put Moya in danger.  Really, this episode is good for a one time see, but is not very interesting and rather boring.  This is one of the few Farscape episodes that was not really that great.
So you've got one good episode and one mediocre episode on this first volume.  But ""Mind the Baby"" is an essential episode to see, so you can't miss this volume.",1022716800,11,1549,4.6

7964729,4,B000068TRR,"If you have never heard of Farscape, I'm sorry- it is one of the best Sci-Fi shows ever.  It is as simple as that.  However, there are plenty of places for you to hear reviews about the show and even these specific episodes so my 4 out of 5 rating is based only on this specific volume of DVDs.  To be clear, I'd give Farscape the series 10 stars out of 5.

However, since these ""mini"" sets are ~$20 each (times 5 for a season) you'd be better off buying the complete Season Two boxed set (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape-The-Complete-Second-Season/dp/B0000C0F8Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape - The Complete Second Season</a>) for about $80.

If you are not yet a fan (and trust me, you will be) and are just looking to get your feet wet, you might look to one of the other individual sets.  While ""Crackers Don't Matter"" is one of my favourite episodes, if I were making a top ten list for Farscape, the other episodes in this volume wouldn't make the cut.",1188432000,,1010,4.911764705882353
7964730,3,B000068TRR,"This disc features two good episodes, but the overall quality is brought down by a couple of clinkers.  ""Mind the Baby"" resolves the first season cliffhangers and gives the renegade commander Crais (Lani Tupu) command of Moya's offspring Talon, the only Leviathan armed with Peacekeeper weapons, setting the stage for some great future episodes.  ""Crackers Don't Matter"" features a creepy alien (Danny Adcock) attempting to take over Moya, but the real fun comes from watching the cast overcome with suspicion of each other and Crichton (Ben Browder) trying to get them to cooperate despite his own burgeoning paranoia.

On the other hand, this set of episodes is hampered by ""Vitas Mortis,"" which at least has the saving grace of offering a glimpse behind the scenes of Luxon culture, and ""Taking the Stone,"" a messy story about a daredevil youth culture on a cemetary planet.",1157241600,,877,5.076388888888889
7964731,4,B000068TRR,"Season 1 of ""Farscape"" ended with as many cliffhangers as they could cram into the season finale. We had Crichton (Ben Browder) and D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe) floating in space; Moya new born baby boy turns out to have built-in Peacekeeper technology, which thrills Captain Crais (Lani John Tupu); Aeryn (Claudia Black) in a Prowler hiding from Scorpius (Wayne Pygram); and Moya starbursts away with Zhaan (Virginia Hey), Chiana (Gigi Edgley), and Rigel. To be fair, there was no ""To Be Continued"" announcement for that season finale, probably because the fate of the show was still up in the air, but with the ""Farscape"" crew scattered to the winds of space there was a sense of anticipation as to how they were going to get out of their respective messes.
That is why ""Mind the Baby"" is such a great disappointment. When I started watching the episode I thought I had the wrong one in the machine because suddenly Crichton and D'Argo are no longer in space. They must have saved a small fortune not having to do the special effects to show how this happened, but it comes across as a cheat to me. It really go the whole episode off on the wrong foot for me and every new revelation as to how things would be different in Season 2 ended up being met with skepticism. I liked the second episode, ""Vitas Mortis"" a lot better, which is rather ironic because the story has absolutely nothing to do with any of the new plot elements that were just established. D'Argo meets up with another Luxan, a Orican (holy woman) named Nilaam, who wants him to attend to her death. However, their association has unexpected consequences, both for the two Luxans and for Moya. This look at Luxan culture is rather brief, but it does give D'Argo some new depth to go along with the dark skin colors he picked up floating around in space between the first two seasons. After all the new information thrown at us in the previous episode, a character study of one of Moya's crew other than Crichton stands us in good stead.
Chiana takes center stage in ""Taking the Stone,"" when she is driven by grief to visit a Royal Cemetary planet where she joins a group of decadent youngsters who engage in ritualistic jumping off of cliffs to test death.  The group is led by Molon (Anthony Hayes), who has even more disdain for the visitors than he does for his own people.  Meanwhile, Crichton is trying to convince Chiana not to ""take the stone.""  This episode reminds me of the ""Star Trek"" episode ""Miri,"" although Chaina provides it with much more emotional depth.  ""Crackers Don't Matter"" is one of those episodes where the characters are driven semi-insane by alien forces and the actors get to cut loose (the cunning Pilot was my favorite).  Behind it all is Traltixx (Danny Adcock), who was called in to help make Moya undetectable to sensors and instead is making her walls glow.  However, it is only the fourth episode of the second season, so why would the cast need a change of pace episode already?
The DVD extras are pretty much a mixed bag, especially after the above average batch of additives from the first season set. There is a character backstory on John Crichton and an actor biography of Ben Browder, but they are both text pages that you have to flip through rather than filmed featurettes; they are also rather brief.  There is a commentary track on ""Crackers Don't Matter,"" which is mostly actress Claudia Black interviewing director Ian Watson about his craft in general.  There are several deleted scenes just for something different this time around and more pages offering a look at the alien encounter with Nilaam and some conceptual drawings, including nice costume drawings for Nilamm.  Finally, there is the Farscape Dictionary of alien slang so you can know  what ""blez,"" ""frodank,"" and ""loomas"" mean.  So these end up being rather average episodes of ""Farscape,"" although obvious the season premiere is setting the stage for what is to come. I am sure we all had our problems with some of the new directions the show is taking at this point (Talon's choice for the big ""honor"" totally rubs me the wrong way), but judgment should be reserved until we see what the show does with them.",1052697600,,4186,4.681632653061224

7964733,4,B000068TRR,"Farscape's sophmere season marks a huge departure from the first, which was great but for the most part safe. Having been picked up for a second year you can tell that the creators decided to stop worrying about pleasing others and began to concentrate on telling great stories that were truly different.
Mind the Baby is the default Season opener, replacing Re:union, and having seen both I am very grateful for the fact. There were a lot of loose ends to tie up from Family Ties and Mind the Baby does a great job of doing that without making everything perfect. The crew is reunited but Scorpious is on their backs ready to pounce when the moment is right. Talyn has become smitten with Crais, thnks to Aeryn. We have some great character development here we see Aeryn is really willing to give up a lot to save the people she cares about, we see that Crichton has become a man of action and although Crais is out for his self he does have the integrity to try and save Crichton and not kill Aeryn. We get a semi-happy ending with everyone alive (which alone is an achievement considering these people can't walk down the street without one of them dying atleast once) but Crais is on Talyn and who knows what he's doing to him. And Aeryn seems to trust him for no apparent reason, which bothers John and will continue to bother him to the end.
Vitas Mortis is only an okay episode. We see that John doesn't trust strangers even old seemingly harmless ones. We see D'Argo find ""love"" with another Luxan and loose it. And we see how laundry is done on MOya. Its not bad filler stuff and there is some character development. But not the best episode ever.
Unlike most people, I actually like Taking the Stone a lot. Chianna is finally given something to do and we get a little back story on her as well. We aslo get to see Chianna, Aeryn and John interact with each other and its nice. Aeryn and CHianna are actually given a scene together, which alone is a miracle, and it looks like Chianna really seems to respect and even likes Aeryn. And although Aeryn isn't at the comforting strange children point of her development yet she does make an effort to be empathetic to Chianna and wants to help her. Continued from Vitas Mortis John is fanaticaly protective of his friends now and won't even consider letting Chianna work things out. He goes as far as to risk his life playing russian roulette with a mushroom. And John and Aeryn have taken there Butch and Sundance routine to a whole new level. They are really comfortable with each other and really do have a couple vibe to them. So the character development is great but the plot is... not. The A plot is all right if you don't mind a straight forward rip off of Logan's RUn. The B plot is just flat out pointless, just skip over it.

Crackers DOn't Matter is just an amazing episode. It alone is worth buying the DVD for. As one reviewer pointed out it does pull out lots of cliches from every science fiction show but it does it on purpose. We get to see what makes Farscape different. The crew has gone insane and while they are busy trying to kill each other a creature is taking over the ship. Not that the plot matters this episode is like recess for the cast but in a good way, they just get to go crazy. We get to see lots of smart and swift verbal sparring espically from Claudia Black and Ben Browder, who just shine together on screen and its even more evident here then in some romantic scenes. Then we have our hero dressed up like King Arthur on crack trying to save the day. And there is also one truly disturbing scene with John and Chianna that makes you shudder but is totally brilliant, its not all fun and games to *them*. Yet despite all the fun these people were shooting at each other with real guns and saying things that really hurt. This is what makes Farscape different there is no reset button. Also it sets up important themes for the whole series. WHy is John the only one hallucinating? Is that Scorpious in his head encouraging him to kill and helping him because John is insane or is it trying to keep him alive? Was JOhn that willing to kill T'Raltixx because of the light or has he changed? Has he become so distrustful that he won't let anyone aboard MOya (unless its an attractive young female which is clearly different)?
Do I really need to point out that although the content is for the most part great the extras are not up there? If all you want is some great extras then don't bother. At least in the Season 1 versions you got video profiles here all you have is text, which is available elsewhere as has been said. The commentery with Claudia Black and Rowan Woods is actually pretty good but I really think they should have had one for Mind the Baby. Season 2, and the series, only gets better after this but I doubt the DVD's will improve much.",1029974400,5,4847,4.385555555555555
7964734,4,B000068TRR,"Extra features are very skimpy, and I could barely hear the deleted scenes audio on disk 1.  Knock off one star for the extras.
Fans who want to have every episode will get this one of course, but beyond the first episode it's not a must-have.  However each episode has its moments, such as ""Here's Johnny!"" in Crackers.  Looking forward to the next set.",1029974400,,354,4.5
7964735,3,B000068TRR,"ADV has again screwed all Farscape fans into paying major money into small DVD purchases. Farscape fans, such as myself, have been waiting patiently for over a year to see Farscape in DVD Box sets. ADV has released a ""Best of"" collection but that isn't going to cut it. What the producers think the best episode is many other people will disagree on. I thought ""Through the Looking Glass"" was the best episode in Season one. And agian, many people will disagree with me. That is the basis to releasing Box Sets. You get it all.
StarGate SG-1 fans got what they wanted when companies began doing what they do with Farscape, releasing seasons little by little. They got Box Sets. Good Box Sets. Region 2 DVD owners have a little bit of an advantage with Farcsape DVD's. They get season releases in three sections, with 6-8 episodes in each set. But even that will not cut the list to most fans.
A show with so many awards and so much more ahead of it should be granted a good DVD realease. ADV will hopefully stop their current plans after season two is finished and start agian from scratch. This is the only show besides Angel that I will ever consider buying in DVD Box Sets.",1026950400,14,1176,4.449074074074074
7964736,4,B000068TRR,"As previously stated, the way that these DVDs are being released here in the states is absurd.  In England there are 4 episodes on each disk, not 2 as it is here, and they get more extra features.  Who wants to have to buy 2 disks to see a three-part episode that got split up?  We're getting soaked.  Why not follow the example of Star Trek TNG, and give us the option of buying each season as a box set for a reasonable price; and please give us all the extras that the people in England are getting!
That said, right now this is the only way to watch these shows in the U.S., and Farscape is a fantastic show, so I highly recommend buying or renting these DVDs (I rent them through Netflix).  The video and sound quality for the shows themselves (not the extras) is great.",1026172800,15,775,4.20945945945946
7964737,3,B000068TRR,"Well, the Second Season of FARSCAPE has started out on dvd with the release of the double DVD from the folks at ADV Films.  It contains two dvds with a couple of episodes on each, but overall the package is something of a disappointment.
The first DVD holds the first two episodes of the 2nd Season of FARSCAPE, ""Mind the Baby"" and ""Vitas Mortis.""  Well, technically, ""Mind the Baby"" is the second episode of the season because originally, the plan was to start the season off with an episode called ""Re:Union,"" but it was felt that the fans needed to know what happened to Crichton, Aeryn, and D'Argo immediately after the end of the first season finale ""Family Ties.""  ""Mind the Baby"" is the story that concerns the rescue of Crichton and D'Argo by Aeryn, the deal she has to strike with one-half of our villainous duo, Crais and Scorpius, and the search on the part of the other half of the duo for Moya and her offspring, Talyn.  This is very much a character-driven episode in which the actions and motivations of much of the cast are explored in new ways, and where Crais may well surprise viewers with his actions, although he appears to be playing a dangerous game with Scorpius throughout.  While Chiana, Zhaan, and Rygel have very little to do in this story, it is one that lays a lot of groundwork for the rest of the Season 2 material, and hints at several ominous aspects of the season.  The second episode on this first DVD, ""Vitas Mortis,"" brings Crichton, Zhaan and D'Argo to a planet in search of a Luxan who turns out be an ancient Orican, one of the Luxan holy women, whom D'Argo agrees to aid in her Ritual of Passage.  When she instead invigorates herself and regains her youth, it is Moya who suffers, however.  The story has some very good character development in it, and the relationship between Chiana and Aeryn becomes clearer.  D'Argo shines in this story, and that is all too the good.
The second DVD begins with ""Taking the Stone,"" the tale of Chiana's joining a gang of drug-taking, risk-taking young men and women on a Royal Cemetary Planet, as a result of her trying to come to terms with her brother's (supposed) death after the life disc she has implanted in her stops working.  Aeryn and Crichton go down to the planet where they try to retrieve her, while Rygel makes off with spoils from the planet's cemetary plots - as it turns out, haunted spoils.  This is a somewhat weak episode in many ways, but certainly gives Gigi Edgley's Chiana a starring role and goes into her motivations and background a bit more without becoming too obvious.  Another episode that is a lead-in to upcoming plots and material for Season 2, but still a weak episode.  The DVD positively sparkles, however, with the fourth episode, ""Crackers Don't Matter,"" in which the arrival of the alien T'raltixx on Moya puts the crew at odds with one another in very spectacular (and somewhat violent) fashion.  It is an episode that has Crichton playing the knight in tarnished armour, and features some wonderful characterisation and over-the-top acting by various members of Moya's crew - including Pilot.
Where this double DVD set fails to please is in the special features.  First, the episodes on these DVDs are only about 45 minutes long, indicating no additional, unseen material in them, although there are two deleted scenes on each DVD.  The first DVD has two scenes from ""Mind the Baby"" and nothing from ""Vitas Mortis,"" while the second DVD has a scene each from ""Taking the Stone"" and ""Crackers Don't Matter"" (and this latter one is a marvellous scene that really should have been on the DVD version episode).  I have no idea whether there were other deleted scenes that could have been added to this DVD set or not, but this material seems somewhat skimpy when all is said and done.  There is only one commentary version on this double DVD, and that is Claudia Black and director Ian Watson on ""Crackers Don't Matter.""  The commentary has little to do with the episode itself, but does reveal a lot about Claudia Black, acting, and some directorial wisdom.  However, there should have been commentaries on this for each of the episodes to really make the DVD worthwhile.  The rest of the special features - the John Crichton Backstory, Ben Browder Actor Profile, Alien Encounters, Farscape Alien Slang - are all *text* files that contain nothing that isn't elsewhere on the internet.  I don't know how much input Henson had to this ""content"" but it is highly disappointing and seriously annoying on a double DVD that cost ...at regular prices!  The Conceptual Artwork features are quite good, but when it comes down to it, this pair of DVDs cost far too much for the most part, especially in light of some of the special features on the British DVDs that seem to come out more frequently than the American ones.
When all is said and done, the Season 2, Volume 1 FARSCAPE double DVD is worth the cost merely to have the four episodes on an excellent quality medium, but is still far pricier than other products of its sort.  ADV Films is doing an injustice to the folks who love FARSCAPE and want the series on DVD, but there is no other means to get the episodes short of purchasing the UK DVDs (and a player to view them on) or to just tape them off the television.  I have very mixed feelings about the quality of this DVD,  but the commentary for ""Crackers Don't Matter"" makes up for this in some ways.",1025827200,,5425,4.6191467221644125
