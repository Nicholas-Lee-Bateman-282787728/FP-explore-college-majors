7979903,5,B000087F3M,"VCI Entertainment has given us two classic Johnny Mack Brown B-western, beautifully and cleanly transferred. Brown was never at the level of Gene Autry or Roy Rogers, but his long career at Universal and later Monogram, give proof to his popularity. Bad Man from Red Butte and Rawhide Ranger are two of his better Universals Westerns. Production values are high in these Universal releases, and sidekick Fuzzy Knight and other stock Brown B-Western cast members help make this two offerings very enjoyable. VCI should be encouraged to release more of these. Highly recommended.",1068768000,8,577,5.21505376344086
7979904,5,B000087F3M,"This presenation by VCI of Johnny Mack Brown's B westerns is magnificent. This release has been described as the first in the series and we can expect many more. After all, Johnny Mack Brown appeared in a LOT of westerns.
The Bad Man from Red Butte has very good production values. There's a lot of horse riding, shooting, fisticuffs and the other stuff that makess B westerns exciting. Unlike others of the genre, this particular film stands out because Universal did not apply Poverty Row techniques. There is hardly use of stock film, so common in other B westerns. There are so many hired extras and people appearing in this feature that this has the feel of an A western. Universal is definitely not Lone Star Productions or any of those [other] companies of that time. This is recommended viewing for fans of the genre.
Rawhide Ranger was produced by Commonwealth Films but still under Universal. So, despite the use of more stock film, the production values are still high and would be considered among the better B westerns produced.
The quality for both features is good. Picture clarity and contrast and sound are excellent. You hardly notice any film deterioration and VCI must have obtained well preserved copies of these two films, though some scratches were very noticeable  in the first feature.
A notable extra to this package is the more than 15 minute Chapter One of a Johnny Mack Brown western serial.
Another plus are the trailers. When I saw the Lone Ranger trailer, I decided to buy a copy for my collection for the picture quality is pristine.
You should not miss this VCI DVD introduction to Johnny Mack Brown B westerns.",1054512000,25,1645,4.771929824561403
