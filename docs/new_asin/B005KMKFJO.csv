8476955,3,B005KMKFJO,"When I watch this movie, I know I'm seeing something unique.  Writing and directing a feature film seems like a difficult task, and one that most people will never accomplish.  Hamish, however, did it and the outcome was exactly what I expected.  As I watched ""Jason's Big Problem,"" I felt like I did when I first watched Kevin Smith's ""Clerks.""  It's an original idea told in the voice of a writer and director that cares about his story.

Even though the subject matter and some of the characters are crude it reflects how some people in the world are.  Everyone knows someone like Jason's coworker Andy:  the friend with no filter who always voices inappropriate thoughts at the wrong time.

I respect Hamish's film making process and thank him for sharing this story.",1435276800,,771,4.7443609022556394
8476956,2,B005KMKFJO,Not sure whether I liked it or not.  I fell asleep in the first 20 minutes and missed the movie.,1405555200,,96,3.8
8476957,1,B005KMKFJO,"It's a story about a guy whose penis get's so big it's a problem for him. The humour is low brow at best and even as a skin flick you'd rent at a motel the quality is bad.

If you want to see a movie about a man who goes from micro to giant and only ever see the outline of a fake penis in his pants leg. This is the movie for you.",1361145600,3,331,3.472972972972973
8476958,5,B005KMKFJO,"This is a great independent film, well worth the purchase, and I can see why it won the awards it did.  A lot of guys would love to have Jason's Problem...  Quality writing throughout as several of the scenes could have easily been skits on SNL.",1350259200,,245,4.304347826086956
8476959,1,B005KMKFJO,"Not sure where all the 5 Star reviews came from; my guess would be that these reviewers were either friends of the director or they worked on the film.  This was unfunny, poorly written and the acting was bad.  Not worth the $2.99.",1347580800,,231,4.348837209302325
8476960,5,B005KMKFJO,"Jason's Big Problem will keep you laughing from start to finish!  From the hilarious supporting cast to the clever writing, this movie is sure to become a cult classic!",1332979200,2,168,4.793103448275862
8476961,5,B005KMKFJO,"Rent this movie! This film is hilarious! Hamish McCollester did a superb job creating a high quality indie film. The cast was perfect, too! Matthew McCallum and Maggie McCollester were adorable and engaging--two great romantic leads! The unapologetic Christopher Halladay took blasphemy to a new and astonishing level. The movie is filled with unforgettable images and dialogue that will stick in your mind like that ""hair gel"" in 'There's Something About Mary'. You're gonna enjoy this balls to the wall funny film.",1323129600,,516,5.304878048780488
