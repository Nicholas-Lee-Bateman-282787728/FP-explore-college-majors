2682608,5,B000K52BL6,"Us die-hard WAG fans have been waiting long enough for the final season on DVD. Thank you for releasing! Looks like Christmas will come early for some of us. The finale was a little bit of a bummer, but overall the season was heeeelarious! I think my fave episode from this season has got to be the live one. When all of Karen's pills fell from the cabinet, I laughed so hard, I think a little pee came out. Thanks again for finally giving us a release date. And FYI, if the ladies from Sex and the City can do a movie...............",1217116800,5,533,4.235294117647059
2682609,5,B000K52BL6,"After soooo much waiting there is finally a set date for the release of Will and Grace season 8. I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this series soooo much it's really funny, witty, and cleverly written. If you have never seen this series start at the beginning, this show is one that makes you immediately drawn to the characters solely based on their humor and wit. Like I said I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this series and I cannot wait to get the final season!!!",1216425600,4,444,4.2976190476190474

Sure the final episode was somewhat of a letdown but over all it was a fab series that I am now in love with :D",1215993600,,156,3.588235294117647

2682612,5,B000K52BL6,"This box set is complete like season 7 but not five or six or the season 2 finale on the season 2 boxset. The Australian Will & Grace Box set is the same as the American DVD boxset because I talked with an Australian retail store. That sells Will & Grace DVD's season 5 & 6 still have the same syndicated episodes as the American version just to let people know.
I know for sure because I have the Australian Will & Grace DVD box set. Only good thing is that all their DVD's work in the set. Unlike here. Some guy said he bought his ""complete"" series in Germany, but their isn't a Will & Grace Complete Series Box set in Germany because they still don't have all the DVD's out yet, they only have 3 seasons and the rest are UK imports. There is not any country that has the ""COMPLETE"" Will & Grace Series. Sorry.",1215648000,,812,4.1455696202531644

2682614,3,B000K52BL6,I thought this was the Will and Grace box set but actually season 8 so was very disappointed and plus it was region 2 which I didn't understand so I resold here on amazon as a box set and another person was duped and emailed me telling me this was only season 8 the best part of this transaction was the seller always returned my emails and was wonderful to deal with and would definately deal with him again as the situation was completely my fault. Thanks mark for your understanding!,1202515200,5,486,4.351648351648351

2682621,2,B000K52BL6,"I purchased this DVD but it was taking too long, so I decided to order the one that has Lions Gate editing. I paid $83, but since I am a true fan, it was worth the price. Since this one (Universal Pictures UK) was so cheap, I decided to not cancel the order. I was able to compare the more expensive one with this one and THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS: THEY LEFT OUT A VERY IMPORTANT SCENE IN THE SECOND TO LAST EPISODE. I'm so glad I bought the more expensive one, so
I could really see how it ended.",1491177600,,494,3.95

2682638,3,B000K52BL6,"I had to buy season 8 as I already had seasons 1-7. But, season 8 was the most disappointing edit and presentation.
In order to have all of the episodes from the final season on the same number of DVDs that are in seasons 1-7, they heavily edited season 8.
As an example, the final story arc concerned an on going story line involving Deborah Harry. I could not have been more disappointed to find that the DVDs had completely edited out the Deborah Harry story arc from the released DVDs.
Deborah Harry was not only a running dialogue joke, she made a cameo appearance in the final episodes of Stanley's death and funeral. IT IS COMPLETELY GONE FROM THE SEASON 8 DVD SET! Instead, the manufacturer's took the final episodes, edited them heavily, and completely left Deborah Harry out.
For those of us who were true fans, it was a disappointment that will never be resolved or healed. Fortunately, I had taped the final season on VHS to watch until the DVDs came out. I never knew that as a person with the final season on VHS, I was one of the few people who will ever know how Will & Grace truly concluded.",1457481600,5,1108,4.409756097560976

It seems to have been written by people who've never watched the show and it's a completely unrealistic end to these characters (there's no way Will and Grace would stop talking to each other for so many years).

Still, for a fan of the series and especially for those with the other seasons on DVD, this is a must-get.  It has a few funny episodes (although this is probably the weakest season of all), and the bloopers are always a good addition to the set.",1224547200,15,607,4.307017543859649
2682740,5,B000K52BL6,"Over eight seasons the writers of 'Will & Grace' provided some genius moments of comedy, moments whose origins are hard to fathom even after repeat viewings.

This show is right up there with 'Everybody Loves Raymond' as a classic of social commentary and observation, with a dash of madness thrown in.

Having never seen this season on TV, the first episode was a bit of a shock - it was filmed 'live' with minimal editing and some mistakes from the cast left in. It was also filmed using the same type of film that daytime soaps use. At least one other episode gets this treatment over the course of the season and, after the initial surprise, it was a welcome addition to the W&G experience.

I found the last show to be one of the best of its kind (again, as with 'Everybody Loves Raymond'). Unlike that criminally bad last Seinfeld episode, the writers of W&G kept their heads and combined the two key elements of the show. Veering a little more toward heart than comedy the end is very satisfying - no unrealistic plot twists, no last grab at self parody, just taking the story to an intelligent, imaginative end.

In between there is the usual mix of what makes W&G great. You have to admire the people who created this program and acted in it (including all the incredible supporting characters) for keeping it sharp as a tack all the way to the end.

My favorite line of this season captures one of the things that I love best about the whole series - that swift change of direction in midstream:

Karen to Jack: ""I'm sorry honey, I don't know what it is today but your faggy little voice is going right through me.""

I highly recommend all eight seasons.",1224374400,5,1664,4.490066225165563

8154360,2,B000K52BL6,"This presents my review of the entire series as I binge watched them.

The series started OK. The characters were not over the top. They were kinda normal. But then after a couple of seasons the show tried to be more outrageous each episode. What came out of these character's mouths was embarrassing. It was shocking that network TV has this filth on it. But that is one reason I stopped watching TV long ago. The Karen and Jack characters are the most likeable as they are funny most of the time without bringing in politics, religion, etc. They don't put down people with abusive real world name calling like the Will and Grace characters did. Actually for a pro-gay show the Will and Grace characters perpetuated negative gay stereotypes in the way that they attacked the Jack character. Kinda ironic I guess. Over all the Jack and Karen characters are funny and make the show entertaining. I would say that the actor and actress who played them were very good actors. But unfortunately they are the vehicle for the most shocking comments here and there in the end, too. The Grace character was annoying from beginning to end. I found myself face forwarding through some of there lines as I couldn't stand here. She whined. She complained about everything. She was VERY selfish. VERY immoral. VERY into and creating the drama. I couldn't stand that character at all. She tried to be so ""pro Jewish"" but would say things like ""Im a good girl. I went to church every Sunday."" or some nonsense while she was . . . oh . . . contemplating having an affaire after the drama created over her husband having an affaire with another women. ""Grace"" was just a loser. We were told that the Will character was the most life-like and responsible. But one thing was annoying when he would look to the side and do some voice or irritating monologue like it was funny. It just look and sounded dumb. But if you subscribe to the idea that doing what society tells you to do (and think) is ""responsible"" then yes Will was. What gets me is these characters lied against each other, blamed people for their horrible actions, were promiscuous, and down right evil in some episodes but they are ""role models"" for the gay world or pro-gray straight world. Was this a joke? Were the writers/creators actually proving the conservative point with this show but the left was too dumb to get it? Or were the creators/writers so depraved that they don't see anything wrong with this bunch of terrible people? Also, the creators made all the heterosexual characters adulterers, mean, and abusive. It was the theme that gay was right and anything else was wrong. It was done in a comical sorta way but it was still there. All the plot lines were immoral. If you had a sense of morality there is no way you could watch this show and be OK. There was the one where the character was contemplating an affaire as if it was a reasonable idea to entertain. Actually there were several of these plots that repeated the same idea. It gets darker than this. I'm sure I would be blocked if I even stated the words. The one character is drug addict and alcoholic. There is mocking of AA. It was supposed to be funny. Goes without saying that there were anti-President Bush and VP Cheney comments in this show given it aired during their administrations. There were anti-Christian comments everywhere.  It was just really a big cesspool of horrible characters.",1514764800,,3421,4.625
