They will ultimately make their own choices, but I guarantee Pam's message WILL change the way many teens follow their emotions.
Every school in American needs to incorporate this video into their Sex Education curriculum. In fact, I know schools that already
have done so.  Go to Pam Stenzel's website... and order it TODAY!",1391990400,6,438,5.0
8541750,2,B009I2XPW6,This was not the video I was looking to purchase. I was given the incorrect title. Definitely not the seller's bad. The seller fulfilled all of their responsibility perfectly.,1380412800,2,175,5.068965517241379
8541751,5,B009I2XPW6,"This video was so much better than I expected! I was thinking it would be a high handed, because the bible says so, condescending lecture-not so! Pam does a great job telling teens and parents why it is important to save sex until marriage and the many pitfalls that exist when you don't. She speaks from the experience of having counseled girls at a teen pregnancy center for 15 years. So many of them said to her that if they had known, they would have made a better choice. She takes an uncomfortable subject and makes it entertaining an informative. Every parent should watch this! This is much better than just telling your kids not to have sex before marriage-it tells them why it is good for them to wait, even though it may be difficult and they will definitely be in the minority.",1366588800,13,789,4.486111111111111

That's the kind of thing Pam Stenzel says about sex here. She makes some claims that are quite a stretch, such as condoms still allowing the user to get STIs... the lie is in her odds: she claims it makes you MORE likely to get STIs rather than less. What she doesn't tell you is that you are only more likely because you are having sex in the first place.

But it gets better. Sometimes she outright lies, and says things like women who use birth control are 10 times more likely to get infected by STIs. I would very much like to know how an estrogen pill raises your chances of getting an STI.

Long story short, Pam promises that anyone who engages in premarital sex will get STIs and die a horrible, lonely death, forsaken by God, their family, and probably their dog. The whole thing is ridiculous and often outright wrong, and is of absolutely no use to you should you wish to actually educate your children about sex. Even a married adult could be harmed by some of the blatant misinformation provided here, it really is that bad.

Please do the world a favour and do not share this package of lies, misinformation, and guilt-mongering with anyone.",1366243200,3,1277,4.515151515151516
