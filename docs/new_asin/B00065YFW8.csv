8039120,5,B00065YFW8,"DVD shows many historical aspects of the world's oldest auto manufacturer.

Great features and video, including the ""secret garage"" that M-B has in Germany.

A must for any fan of the M-B autos.

Highly recommended.",1125360000,3,215,5.085714285714285
8039121,4,B00065YFW8,"If you're a MBZ or if you know of someone that is a fan, this DVD should be part of their collection. Very well put together, very informative and has a lot of great information.",1122854400,,178,4.114285714285714
8039122,5,B00065YFW8,As a fan of Mercedes Benz I was pleasantly surprised to see a documentary with such good information. I highly recommend this disc to anyone who likes cars.,1122422400,,156,4.607142857142857
8039123,5,B00065YFW8,"I bought this dvd for my father for his birthday. He's a big Mercedes Benz fan, and he absolutely loved the dvd. He learned all sorts of stuff he didn't know. It turned out to be the perfect gift for a Mercedes Benz fan.",1121644800,,220,4.0227272727272725
8039124,1,B00065YFW8,"This is a highly disappointing documentary of a subject that deserves better.  The continual re-use of images from the Mercedes museum, the third-grade stop-motion of images of cars on the track, the lack of footage of racing or production cars in motion, and the overly lengthy interviews with Mercedes-Benz staff w/ limited English all conspire to make the film almost unwatchable.  Even the DVD menu does not work correctly.  The filmakers are trying to bite off more than they can chew.",1120780800,3,490,5.0246913580246915
