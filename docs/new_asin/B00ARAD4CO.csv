8556824,2,B00ARAD4CO,"Agree with above.  The blu-ray transfer for this Japanese blu-ray release is atrocious.  I was disappointed.  Most footage is ok, but some (and more than enough) is so bad, it looks like it was sourced from an old 1980's betamax tape.  I'm not exaggerating - it's that's bad.  Was the original source film lost/destroyed?  I had been expecting the same quality as Arrivederci Yamato, which was absolutely stunning and spectacular.  As this was the final chapter in the original series, it's too bad the quality wasn't up to par.

Audio also was not remastered (Arrivederci Yamato did, and contained both original and remastered versions).

Movie is still watchable, and enjoyable, but don't expect to be wowed by this blu-ray transfer. It's still watchable, but nowhere close to what one would consider a hi-def remaster.  Note that it didn't keep me from buying it - I wanted it for my collection regardless.",1444953600,4,909,4.960264900662252
8556825,3,B00ARAD4CO,"I'm one of those few who might feel that Final Yamato is underrated. Is it long? Yes. Indulgent? Yes. Is it a love-letter to fans, such that non-fans might find it a bit plodding? Probably. But for true Yamato devotees, the movie is tailored as a farewell to the ship and crew, a capper on top of the three previous TV series and four movies.

I really wanted to give this blu-ray a higher rating, but the presentation is... weird. Most scenes are fine; all the indoor scene, outer space scenes, they're clear, crisp, and beautiful. However any scene with ""special effects,"" like any scene featuring Aquarius's water, looks very blurry and smeary. While most scenes are gorgeous 1080p, those scenes with some water or smoke effects look grainier and murker than the low-def NTSC release in the US. It's very puzzling, and I'd like to believe that there's some incompatibility between Japanese and US blu-ray standards, but I haven't seen anything to suggest that's the case.

I'll keep digging and revise/follow-up the review if anything changes.",1430265600,,1046,4.903954802259887
