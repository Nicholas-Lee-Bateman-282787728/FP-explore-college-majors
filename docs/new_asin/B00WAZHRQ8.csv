7129812,3,B00WAZHRQ8,Somewhat disappointing as it didn't include a lot of his best work.,1437177600,2,67,4.666666666666667

7129834,5,B00WAZHRQ8,"Well, right off the bat with Gustavo Dudamel and Itzhak Perlman on the bill, expectations are great.  And greatness is indeed what is delivered here, as Mr. Dudamel is (as usual) so insanely in touch with the music that everything seems natural and just feels right.  The program itself starts with the Olympic Fanfare and Theme, the commissioned piece Soundings, three works from Schindlers List (featuring Mr. Perlman  this section is just amazing), a Cadenza and Variations from Fiddler on the Roof (delightful work from Mr. Perlman here too), three short works from Catch Me If You Can (Closing In, Reflections, and Joy Ride), and the Throne Room and Finale from Star Wars.

There are, of course, encores, and the first is Dry your tears, Africa from Amistad featuring the Los Angeles Childrens Chorus.  This piece is *amazing* on the DVD, and the harmonies are just unbelievably beautiful.  This track is worth the price of the DVD by itself  it is stunning.  This is followed by an excerpt from Jaws.  Closing out the performance is John Williams himself being brought on stage to conduct the Imperial March from The Empire Strikes Back, and it is a real treat to watch Mr. Williams bring this work to life.

The DVD contains two bonus tracks  an interview with John Williams and Gustavo Dudamel, and an Interview with Itzhak Perlman.  Both segments are interesting and warm, giving further insight into the compositional evolution of Mr. Williams and the musical material as well.

Needless to say, the Blu-Ray medium makes this experience all the more special.  The audio quality is excellent, and the video footage is crisp and spectacular.  I cant say enough about the quality of the music making by the Los Angeles Philharmonic  they all play their hearts out, and the results are just unbelievable.  This is a truly wonderful production from C-major, and is well worth owning if John Williams music is special to you.  Very highly recommended!",1471478400,,1955,4.926605504587156

7129836,5,B00WAZHRQ8,"Gustavo Dudamel leads the LA Phil in a spirited live concert honoring the music of John Williams.  The Army Herald Trumpets join the orchestra for the Williams Olympic Fanfare and the rest of the performance is outstanding, including a lively performance of music of Star Wars complete with a cameo appearance of Darth Vader and the Storm Troopers.  The acoustics of the magnificent Disney Hall are captured in the recording.  Highly recommended.",1463270400,,446,5.166666666666667

7129840,5,B00WAZHRQ8,"This is an instant classic for John Williams fans. Specially when you realize that there's not much material about him in DVD/BD. The extras are rather simplistic, just a few short interviews. But I still appreciate them. Now, the main feature -the concert- is superb. Sound and image quality are outstanding. I loved how they used raw original designs as visual background for the Star Wars theme, as well as other visual scenes for the other themes. I wish there could be a series of concerts with more JW homages (but I doubt they will do it). I'm not a huge fan of Dudamel (even though I'm from Venezuela) but I think he pulled out a great performance, both from a musical and 'entertainment' standpoint.",1456012800,4,708,4.672

7129860,4,B00WAZHRQ8,"I'm giving it 4 stars largely because events like this occur rarely.  The performances are ok, not much more. Itzhak Perlman gave me the impression that he had performed these numbers once too often.  ""Soundings"" and the 3 pieces from ""Catch Me...."" may be impressive to sophisticates, but for somebody who likes his movie music melodic, they were not for me. ET and Superman may be almost cliched, but in the concert hall they are rarities and should be heard more. Simply put, this concert needed more classic Williams and not classical Williams",1440201600,,547,4.870967741935484

7129877,5,B00WAZHRQ8,"I enjoy classical music and one of my disappointments is that the classical music radio station in my area in Florida closed. This issue aside, I try to listen to not only somewhat ancient classical music - as from Mozart or Mendelssohn or Beethoven or Bach - but also modern pieces that capture some of the modern atmosphere. Thus, I enjoyed the celebration of John William's works.
The LA Philharmonic played such works as William's contribution to ET, Star Wars, Amistad, Catch me if you can, and more. Itzchak Perlman performed music from Shindler's List with emotion and from Fiddler on a Roof.
The show was very enjoyable.",1438300800,3,628,4.824074074074074

7129879,5,B00WAZHRQ8,"This is a wonderful document of a unique evening in Los Angeles last September 2014 (I think it was September) when the Los Angeles Philharmonic opened its 2014/15 season at Disney Hall with an 85 minute concert featuring the music of John Williams. With LAP Music Director Gustavo Dudamel on the podium and Itzhak Perlman guesting to play three pieces from the score of ""Schindler's List"" (plus the US Army Herald Trumpets and the L.A. Children's Chorus) the concert may have aired live on PBS (it was co-produced by New York's WNET), but it wasn't a US company that released this wonderful Bluray disc. It was the German TV network WDR and a German import label - Major.

One reviewer here complained that this was not a concert of Williams' ""hits"". No it isn't when you think of recordings. But that's what makes it special. There are at least a dozen videos of concerts (usually ""pops"" orchestras) playing ""Star Wars"" (and subsequent films, ""E.T."", ""Lincoln"" and more. Yes, we get a piece of ""Star wars"" here but we also get three segments from the Tom Hanks film ""Catch Me If You Can"". I don't think I've ever heard that before (other than seeing the film). We get a piece from the African-American history film ""Armistad"" (cue the Children's chorus!), and even the opening titles from ""Fiddler on the Roof"" (I didn't know it was not by Jerry Bock, and many others didn't either). The most unique piece (and - honestly - the least ""commercial"" is ""Soundings"", a single movement 15-minute composition that Williams wrote specifically for the LAP and Disney Hall. I don't mean the folks who managed the Hall; I mean the physical venue itself. It is a ""conversation between the musicians playing and the sonics of the inside of the building.

The camera work is superb - and there is a large screen on stage to introduce each piece. And even on my $400 HD TV the BD looked and sounded great!
As a bonus feature there is a 13 minute ""conversation"" with Williams and Dudamel about Williams's career as well as each piece performed in the concert. It's very insightful.

I should point out that the concert recording was not edited so you will have to sit through several long standing ovations and applause.

Like many other music DVDs from Germany there is a 20-page booklet of photos, track list, list of ALL the musicians and a 2  page essay (in three languages) enclosed.

If you want to see the breadth of Williams' compositions - and not hear the (though great) ""same old - same old"" selections, I think you'll love this BD. I certainly did/.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7129880,5,B00WAZHRQ8,"When Gustavo Dudamel takes the microphone towards the end of this LA Philharmonic concert at the Disney Concert Hall, his tribute to John Williams as one of the top 20th century composers seemed to ring true with the audience, as Im sure it will to many watching this Blu Ray at home. The audience is surprisingly enthusiastic, considering the many tuxedoes and designer gowns at this gala concert. Lets just say this is more a Golden Globes crowd than an Academy Awards one.

Theres so much to be enthusiastic about. Soundings, a piece Williams wrote to focus attention on the special qualities and capabilities of the Walt Disney Concert Hall, is a serious and always interesting showpiece for orchestra. The orchestra and Dudamel are definitely up to the task. But its two of Williams strongest film scores that provide what I feel are the best works in the concert. Three Pieces from Schindlers List is a short but intense suite for violin and orchestra. Itzhak Perlman plays the beautiful, inventive violin part in a tasteful fashion, never maudlin but with just the tiniest bit of schmalzig. This is the way, perhaps, that Fritz Kreisler would have played ""Theme"", one of the saddest and most beautiful pieces of music ever written. Incidentally, I much prefer this order of the movements, rather than the version sometimes played where Theme comes first. I loved the bit of stage business before this piece. Dudamel carries Perlmans violin as he follows the violinist slowly making his way to the podium on his crutches. When he hands Perlman the violin, he gets a wink, a funny face, and his baton in return.

Escapades from Catch Me If You Can, one of Spielburgs most under-rated films, is a hugely entertaining piece that the otherwise excellent liner notes by Jon Burlingame mis-identifies as a miniature alto saxophone concerto.  In fact, this is a jazzy miniature concerto for three instruments which deserve equal billing. Billing, Ive heard, is important in Hollywood! The piece is played here by three expert, charming instrumentalists. They are saxophonist Dan Higgins, vibraphonist Glenn Paulson, and bassist Michael Valerio. This is a piece that deserves to be programmed much more often, though good luck finding three musicians at this level, especially by plucking them out of the orchestra!

Spoiler alert: hijinks! Spoilers don't usually loom large in classical music reviews, but lots of fun happens during the encores.  This, and the substantial bonus interviews with Williams, Dudamel and Perlman, are enough on their own to buy this disc. The Blu Ray, with its excellent sound and beautiful HD picture, is very highly recommended.",1437696000,14,2658,5.059360730593608
7129881,5,B00WAZHRQ8,"This is a sonically amazing and highly entertaining collection that I suspect will make an excellent historic recording at some point. First, I think that few would argue with John Williams being considered perhaps America's greatest and most recognized film composer. Not since Bernard Herrmann - perhaps - has any one composer done so many film scores and been seen for so long as ""the"" name in this genre as has Williams. It is true that some of his better known works (such as ""Raiders"" or ""Superman"" or ""ET""...) are not part of this program intended to celebrate his work at the beginning of the 2014 season with the LA Phil. There are, however, some really interesting and attractive lesser know, such as selections from ""Catch Me if You Can"" or ""Amistad.""  There is also Williams' fairly well known Olympic fanfare with he US Army Herald Trumpets joining in!  I was also quite impressed with his ""Soundings"" the work he wrote specifically for the opening of Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2003. This non-theatrical 'concert' work showcases the acoustic and architectural beauty of the WDCH as well the powerful LA Phil very well!  Another real treat is having the incredible Itzhak Perlman play selections from ""Schindler's List""  It is clear that music director Gustavo Dudamel is a true John Williams fan and the performances reflect this fact. The sight and sound on this Bluray version of this genuinely fun release are terrific and I think that any John Williams fan would really like to  have this.  Who knows how many more exciting and creative pieces of music Williams will give us but I have cherished every minute. I also think his place in both American ""pop culture"" but also in the history of film music  is more than secure!",1437523200,11,1742,4.806020066889632

8712757,5,B00WAZHRQ8,"""A John Williams Celebration"" is a 2015 video release of a live concert recorded in the beautiful Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2014. Conducting is the famed and popular Gustavo Dudamel, who leads the excellent Los Angeles Philharmonic.

One thing I particularly enjoyed about ""Celebration"" was its variety of Williams' music. Many John Williams concerts contain the usual brassy favorites, such as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, or Superman. While ""Celebration"" does contain some music of that ilk (i.e. Star Wars and The Olympic Fanfare) it also shows some different sides of Williams, from the tender Schindler's List, to the subtly jazzy Catch Me If You Can, to the experimental ""Soundings."" I also appreciated the obvious care that the conductor and orchestra put into performing the music. Having the participation of Itzhak Perlman is also a bonus to the performance.

The audio and video quality of ""A John Williams Celebration"" are excellent. Also included on the disc are a couple of interesting--though short-- interviews with Williams, Dudamel, and Perlman. Program notes are included with the disc, and also contain credits and several photographs. About my only complaint with ""Celebration"" is the excessive amounts of applause, walking on and off stage, etc. I wouldn't have minded if the video had some of this edited out, but it's a small complaint.

If you enjoy John Williams or film music in general, ""A John Williams Celebration"" is well worth your time. It's such a pleasure to see quality, live video recordings of this music.

If you enjoyed this product, I would also recommend the following videos: ""Hollywood in Vienna: The World of James Horner,"" ""Hans Zimmer: Live in Prague,"" and ""Score: A Film Music Documentary.""",1525651200,,1737,5.170818505338079
