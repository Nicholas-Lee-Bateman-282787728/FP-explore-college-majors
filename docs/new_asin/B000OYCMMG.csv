2805154,5,B000OYCMMG,"I am a longtime Leslie Sansone fan and this series is absolutely her best yet!! The music is pumped up and motivating and boosted walking makes all the difference in the world. As a happy,longtime member of Leslie's WalkClub,the Fast Start walk is very special as it has three of our wonderful,incredible WalkClub members in it. The three gals Leslie talks to at the end of FastStart are all WalkClub members who,like so many,myself included,have had AMAZING success with Leslie's programs.

  3 Fast Miles is just plain fun! EVERYONE is having a great time walking to high energy,positive music. Leslie is,as usual,so spirited and lively.

  This DVD is awesome!! She still keeps it simple but pumps up her walking routine. There is no way you won't see results using this workout. DEFINITELY Leslie at her very best!!",1180224000,14,819,4.9416058394160585
2805155,5,B000OYCMMG,"There are two DVDs in the case.  The first one is called Fast Start and has a 2 mile interval walk on it (she lets you know when one mile is done so if you don't want to do 2 miles, you can skip to the cool down).  She does her usual moves (marching, side steps, knee lifts, hamstring curls)  and every few minutes gives the option of doing a higher intensity burst (jog instead of march, leg swings instead of side steps).  It's a perfectly fine workout and I'm sure lots of people will like it, but it didn't really appeal to me and I don't know how much use I'll get out of it.  The second DVD is called 3 Fast Miles. It moves along at a pretty brisk pace.  She throws in a few extra moves that you don't usually see in her workouts.  Don't worry, the steps are still easy enought to catch onto, and it adds a nice bit of variety to the usual fare.  There are some spots where her cueing is off, but after a couple times through you know where they are and can anticipate it.  Also, late in the workout she has MaryKay lead for a little bit, but she isn't miked so you have to watch her hands to know what move is coming up. The good news is,  this workout has some of the best music she's ever used.  It's very up tempo and some of it is actual recognizable songs with lyrics.  It makes it feel kind of party-like to me and Leslie herself is quite obviously having fun here.  This is my new favorite Leslie workout!",1180051200,52,1419,4.043010752688172
2805156,5,B000OYCMMG,let me tell you i have done alot of leslies videos and this one is awesome it is sooooooooooooo much fun to do and you will definetly feel it the next day. i know alot of people don't like to hear her chatter but this one is so much fun to watch because it has awesome music and it is very uplifting. of all her videos this 3 mile one is the only one i am going to use from now on. i used a perdometer and it calculated 5894 steps short of 106 for the 6000 you walk for a regular 3 mile walk. trust me this one is fun.for those of you who cant stand the chatter it has a music only button.,1179964800,24,589,3.72
2805197,5,B000OYCMMG,"I was very pleased with my purchase from the seller and the DVD was everything I expected. It really gets your heart pumping. I have tried other walking dvd's by Leslie Sansone but this is my favorite by far. I was torn between buying a treadmill and purchasing this 3 fast mile dvd and I am very pleased with my choice of deciding to purchase the 3 mile dvd instead.
In fact, I have lost 13 lbs since I started the 3 fast mile dvd about 3 weeks ago.",1276560000,,450,4.067415730337078
2805198,5,B000OYCMMG,"I have the complete Walk Slim series. I like all of the DVD's in this set.  Each one is a little different. The 1&2 miles walk ( which is 1 walk, you just skip to the cool down if you only want to walk 1 mile ) There are jogging(boosted walking) intervals. You can really increase to a faster pace by jogging faster; I work up a sweat quickly. The 3 Fast Miles doesn't included jogging..it increases to a fast pace and stays there until time for the cool down. The music is good, and there is some dancing too.. All ages are in the group.  Leslie does interact with the group, but she's not over the top.  There is also a music only option which is a definite plus if you don't like the talking.  I really enjoy 3 mile walks...not too short, not too long.  This would be a great addition to your workout library.",1275868800,,812,4.146496815286624
2805199,5,B000OYCMMG,"I am happy with the product.

However, the product on my hand is something wrong with the DVD Labels.  i.e. the DVD for 1 & 2 Mile Walk is labelled as ""3 Fast Miles"".  You must be surprised why I did not complaint. Since I really like and enjoy the walk-at-home programme and I do not want to send back for exchange whilst I have to wait for another couples of week (I stay overseas.

I think you may check the batch of products to avoid your custmers'complaint in the future.",1267660800,,476,4.197802197802198
2805200,4,B000OYCMMG,"I REALLY LIKED THE CD'S.  THE 3 MILER WAS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,,,,,FASTER AND LONGER EXERCISE TIME.

THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT THE C.D'S WERE LABELED WRONG.  THE 1 & 2 MILE WORKOUT WAS LABELED ""3 FAST MILES"" AND THE 3 MILE WORKOUT WAS LABELED ""1 & 2 MILE WALK.",1265500800,,267,4.096153846153846
2805201,3,B000OYCMMG,"I own a LOT of Leslie's workouts, and generally I like them all.  I walk with her at least 3 days a week, in-between my heavier days when I do weight/resistance training.  I have found that her walking workouts are great for recovery days, but you still get in a nice workout that gets blood to the muscles and helps them recover.  She does very basic moves that anyone can follow, and the upbeat attitude of her workouts keeps me motivated.  However, with this particular workout, I found the quality to be very poor when compared to her other workouts.  The first thing that should have tipped me off was the fact that this two-disc set (a 2-mile workout with jogging intervals and a 3-mile walking workout) had the discs mislabeled--the 2-mile walk was labeled as the 3-mile, and vice-versa.

The Fast Start 1 & 2 mile I did first, and I really enjoyed it.  I always love her workouts with the jogging intervals (or, as she calls it, ""boosted walking"").  It was about 30 minutes, got my heart rate up, and was a nicely organized workout.  However, the 3-mile walk was the most disorganized video I've ever seen from her.  She would start and stop moves without cueing properly, or tell you a move was coming up but then make you walk forever first because, as she states, ""I wasn't ready!""  What got me at the end was when she all of a sudden tells Mary Kay to lead (I don't think Mary Kay was expecting this, because she wasn't wearing a mic!).  Then, Mary Kay had to lead us through a few moves with you not being able to hear her or have her verbally cue you as to what was coming next.  But, because the whole workout was a disorganized mess, my heart rate didn't get very high, and I didn't feel like I got a good workout at all--I felt like I wasted 40 minutes of my precious workout time I set aside for myself every morning.  This is the first workout by Leslie where I have EVER felt that way when I was done.

Overall, I was very disappointed with this purchase.  I will continue to do the Fast Start 1 & 2 mile workout, but, as for the 3-mile workout, I wouldn't even give that away--I wouldn't want to put someone else through that.

2805202,5,B000OYCMMG,"The need for exercise, walking, after a heart attack and cardio-rehabilitation motivated me to try this great DVD. Living in the Midwest creates a weather challenge.  Leslie Sansone offers an indoor alternative that is safe and similar to the treadmill, bicycle, and step workouts during my cardio-rehab therapy.

When the pace picks up (cardio-rehab had me walking 4 mph on an incline) to a jog, I simply followed Leslie's instructions and used walking and sidesteps till I could rejoin the routine.  The workouts in this set brought me to a comparable sweat, but not quite the peak of blood pressure, a VERY GOOD, COMFORTABLE, AND SAFE EXPERIENCE.

Since borrowing this set and others from the library for a trial run, I have purchased several Leslie Sansone workout DVDs to be used as my life-style exercise change for a fitter, healthier, heart-safe future.  Another plus, my wife and I can exercise TOGETHER because this DVD meets both our needs and abilities.

It's not for wimp's, but I am over 60, and this is doable.  Of course, any heart patient should get approval for their own condition.  This sure is in line for what my heart-healthy life needs.

Please Leslie, more low-impact DVDs for we Baby Boomers to use to keep healthy.",1261094400,,1241,4.871428571428571
2805203,5,B000OYCMMG,"I found this in my library and figured I would try it out. I first found leslie sansone on dr. oz's web site, tried her video and it seemed easy.
So i got this from my library and i did the first cd workout which wasn't bad. I actually finished the whole workout. I feel better although i wish i knew how many calories i burned??",1254960000,,329,4.0
2805204,5,B000OYCMMG,"I much prefer the lower impact movements of the 3 Fast Miles to the other DVD in this set (1 & 2 Miles). This is really fast but I surprised myself by being able to keep up through the whole thing. I've been doing Leslie's workouts for years but I've decided to bump up my efforts and only do 3 miles for awhile. This one is perfect. It's fast. It's fun. I just finished the workout before I sat down to write this review and I'm dripping sweat. LOL I feel as if I've accomplished something important - another step to good health. Thank you, Leslie Sansone. Your workouts are wonderful.",1249776000,,587,4.297297297297297
2805205,5,B000OYCMMG,"i have many excercise dvd's.  this one is the best and have been using it for about six months and notice the difference.  for those of u wondering if this dvd is worth it.  YES, it is!",1249257600,,185,3.945945945945946
2805206,5,B000OYCMMG,"The Walk Slim Fast Start & 3 Fast Miles is fantastic!  I walk outside 1 1/2 to 2 miles each day, but was not seeing the results I wanted. In a months time using this DVD, I have seen amazing improvement in the firmness of my legs, and increased stamina.  You not only walk, but get arm movement and the leg kicks & leg raises use the abdominal muscles to tighten those also.  I am so happy I purchased this DVD and I haven't even used the 3 Fast Mile DVD yet.  She is a little gabby, but you get used to her and it makes the time go faster.",1239840000,,540,3.881818181818182
2805227,4,B000OYCMMG,"I was first introduced to these videos at a Yuma AZ RV Park, in an exercise class.  I thought they were great and something I would stick to when I got home, I sent for this one right away so I it would be in the mail when I got home.  Leslie keeps it moving and is really easy to follow and it works.",1237852800,,301,3.6875
2805228,5,B000OYCMMG,I bought this DVD last night because it was on sale. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it so much. I do a bootcamp class 3x a week but the weather kept us from exercising and this video provided a good workout. I added heavy weights to make it more challenging. I definitely would recommend it to beginners and intermediates. I am going to buy the 5 mile and give my mother a copy of this one.,1236038400,,387,4.105263157894737
2805229,5,B000OYCMMG,"I now have 11 of Leslie Sansone's videos and I love every one of them. She often states that her workouts are not for sissies and that is very true but REALLY anyone can do them. You just set your own pace. I started working out with Leslie's videos on April 1st, 2008. I weighed 240 lbs. It is now February 24th, 2009 and I am happy...no thrilled to tell you that I have walked away 83 lbs!!! I went from 2X to size 12. My goal is to lose 100 lbs and I know I will get there. When I started out I could barely get to the end of the 3 mile video. I'm up to 5 miles now and I love it! I'm hooked! What a great thing to be addicted to...excerize!!! Now here's the best part....I'm 62..I'll be 63 in just a few days and the young girls who work out with me can't keep up!!! Please do yourself a huge favor and get started walking away the pounds today. Or just do it to be healthier. Either way, you come out a winner!!!",1235433600,10,917,3.882978723404255
2805230,4,B000OYCMMG,"The DVD is pretty good and you will get a good workout, but I feel that Leslie seems way too goofy on this tape.

About the dvd itself: There are 2 DVDs with a chapter option so you can select 1 mile, 2mile, etc. The best feature for this dvd is that it has a music only option so even if you are like me and find Leslie to be too goofy for your taste once you get used to the moves you can play it with no voices and only music. The workouts themselves are interspersed with high intensity jogging and low impact fast walking. From the start it moves pretty fast so if this is your first time with the walk slim dvds try to take it easy until you can move up to the higher intensity moves. Also these workouts don't use any extras like the weighted balls, stretchie, or the ab belt so its very accessible for everyone. 4 stars for the good workout but not for Leslie's goofiness... I usually am ok with her chatter but not on this DVD.",1234828800,,936,4.059459459459459
2805231,5,B000OYCMMG,"I really love this DVD.  I injured my back terribly last summer and wanted to do some low impact exercising.  Walking was the only thing I could do without re-injuring my back.  This DVD was perfect.  I was able to start slowly and go at my own pace which made the world of difference.  My right leg down to my foot was half numb from my back problem and after several weeks I noticed my leg was a lot less numb feeling...this DVD is really helping my circulation and doesn't hurt my back as long as I go at a steady pace.

I highly recommend this DVD or others by Leslie Sansone.  She is fun, vibrant and very enjoyable to watch and listen to.",1234656000,,644,4.145161290322581
2805232,5,B000OYCMMG,"Leslie Sansone's Walk Slim is just awesome.  So easy to do and to keep doing.  A lot of fun, not boring.  I really like that it gives the option of just watching and hearing the music but not the talking if you want to.  Great DVD!",1234310400,,231,3.9565217391304346
2805233,4,B000OYCMMG,"If you're looking for a Leslie Sansone walking workout that uses no props (stretchie band, belt or weights), then this is the one for you. I have and enjoy many of the workouts that include utilization of the props, but their use typically slows the pace of the walking during that section.

This workout features some of the regulars that those of you who have been doing Leslie for a while will recognize:  Carol, Jo, Linda, Mary Kay - as well as her 14 year old daugher, Marie, and 20 year old niece, whose name I can't recall.  These women don't seem to be aging, but improving, so if it's the walking doing it for them, I'm ""in""!

I bought this DVD for the 3 mile workout, which actually clocked out to take place in about 38-40 minutes, with the stretch taking up the remaining workout time listed.  The workout is high energy and everyone seems to be having giddy fun.

The only reason I rated it a 4 is because this is not one of Leslie's best cueing jobs.  She typically does a pretty good job of cuing, but there were numerous places where even her ""class"" was caught off guard - and one place where she apologizes.  It doesn't detract at all from the workout - and if you've been doing her workouts for a while, you'll be able to follow along.  After all, as she repeatedly tells us, you can't do these workouts wrong.

I mention this mainly for those who are considering this as their first purchase.  If you start out with the 1 and 2 Mile Walk, by the time you work up to the 3 mile, you'll be a veteran and won't be troubled by this at all.  However, if this is the first workout you do, this one is not really indicative of her usual cueing.  All that said, I'll take the few very minor flubs that come with this infectiously fun workout any day.

As I've said before in other Leslie Sansone reviews, when a friend told me about these workouts, I thought walking in front of your TV was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of.  But I tried one and got hooked.  I find these workouts easier on my sensitive feet and I get more mileage in than when I use my treadmill.  There is no fancy footwork to learn - if you can walk, side step, lift your knees and kick, you can do this workout ... and if you don't want to do those things, just keep marching.  It really is that easy. If you've never exercised before, this is a great way to start - and if you're already regularly exercising, check out the reviews to find the ones that are a little more demanding.",1232236800,,2478,4.247334754797441
2805234,5,B000OYCMMG,A group of us at work started walking during our lunch hour. Weather was always a factor.  One of my co-workers suggested getting Leslie Sansone's Walk Slim.  We did and are walking inside to her DVD four or five days a week. We love this DVD.  It is a great way to get started walking and once we achieved the Two Mile Fast Start we graduated to the 3 Fast Miles! Now we are looking forward to her other DVD's.,1225670400,,411,4.1125
2805235,5,B000OYCMMG,"I have tried many of the Leslie Sansone videos and have always been pleased. Her interaction with the other walkers can get on your nerves, but other than that the workout is excellent and fast. Great workout even if you don't have a lot of time.",1224720000,,246,4.369565217391305
2805236,4,B000OYCMMG,"Similar to T. Smith, my discs were mislabeled. I decided to keep them rather than send them back. I just have to remember that the labels are switched.

I enjoyed the workout for the most part. Leslie is a tad chatty on this one. But, I enjoyed the interval or ""boosted"" walking. It was a change of pace. I find that I actually work harder with the DVD's than I do on the treadmill at the gym. And, it is nice to get the upper body work.

So far, Leslie has the best walking workouts. I have DVD's from other trainers (Prevention, Kathy Smith, Denise Austin) but I just don't enjoy them as much. I like how Leslie focuses on health rather than weight loss. I think that will help me to stay on track because I will focus on how I feel rather than how much I weigh.",1209945600,,764,4.120805369127517

2805249,4,B000OYCMMG,"I must start by saying that I love Leslie Sansone's DVDs and this was probably my 5th DVD purchase. I read the other ratings and assumed that some people just were not familiar with her style and technique. I do have to say that of the two DVDs in this pack, I like the 3 mile way more than the first 2.

The reason being, is that the first 2 miles looks like a ""practice round"" it's very badly edited and compared to the 3 mile, you can tell that it probably wasn't supposed to be a ""final cut"". I enjoyed the 3 mile, the girls are fun and Leslie's peppy attitude is contagious. Anyone who's done Leslie's DVDs knows that you can stop at any of the mile long intervals if you do not have the time or energy to do the other ones.

I only use the 3 mile disc because I find the 1 & 2 mile disc to be bad quality.",1204070400,3,811,3.909090909090909

2805253,4,B000OYCMMG,"I have quite a few of Leslie's workout DVD's and love just about every one of them.  This collection is not the quality I'm use to.  While doing the 3 mile DVD she becomes winded, loses focus, starts doing steps without telling others to the point that she has Mary Kay take over for her so she can get it together.  It's obvious Leslie tapes may different videos all in one day.  The 3 mile must have been the last workout of the day because she's very scattered.

I will always go back to Walk Away the Pounds 3 mile - Leslie bring that group back!  They were great!  And I can always fall back on any of the Walk away the Pounds Express tapes.  I always get a good workout with that series.

However, it is very distracting that she doesn't clue you in on time to switch to the next move.  I love the music it keeps you going.  I also liked that she hads people of different ages on there.  She does talk alot about stuff that don't pertain to the workout and laughs to much.  It dosn't bother me about the camera man at all, he's not in the way.  My over all opinion is that it is a good workout and worth doing,  you will work up a sweat.  I will be buying more of her types.",1191888000,3,607,3.869918699186992
2805279,4,B000OYCMMG,"I bought my first Leslie Sansone Walk at Home video about 2 months ago after being told by the doc ""Lose weight or else.""  Now I have 6 of them.  I must say that, for the most part, I really enjoy the workouts.  They're perfect for women like me who used to be active and then maybe let exercise and activity slip by the wayside due to busy life circumstances (e.g. having a baby who then turns into a very hyper toddler. :)  Not only am I now exercising and toning some, I also have the energy to keep up with my busy little guy.

The 1 & 2 Mile workout is very good for the 35 minutes you spend with it.  It gets you used to the concept of interval training and definitely bumps your heart rate up (especially for those of us who haven't been used to moving as much).  To me, this video doesn't have *as* much of the annoying chatter that Leslie likes to toss about during her workouts, and I do like the people that are participating in the video.  Now, as for the 3 Mile...well, it's a wonderful workout **IF** you can make it though all the mis-cues and missed step introductions, which I found extremely distracting.  Leslie's mind definitely seems to be elsewhere rather than focused on making a workout that's easy to follow.  However, it *will* make you sweat and get your heart rate up if you work it.  It does incorporate a few new moves that are easy to follow, and they keep this workout from seeming like a clone of some of her previous workouts.

Overall, though, I think these 2 DVD workouts are great if you want to get yourself back on track--try not to let the distractions annoy you too much.",1191801600,7,1612,4.2838283828382835
2805280,4,B000OYCMMG,"I ordered the Walk Slim Fast Start & 3 Fast Miles, thinking they would be similar to other Leslie Sansone work-outs. I should have tuned into the word ""fast"" in the title, but it went right over my head.  These workouts are definitely faster than most of her other workouts. Since I am 58 years old, overweight, and have been dealing with rheumatoid arthritis for 10 years, they proved to be a little fast for me. I can do the two mile on a good day, but the three-mile is beyond my reach at the moment.

However, I think that younger people in good shape would really like both workouts. I have read reviews of Leslie's walks saying they are not challenging enough. Well,these two are! The music is snappy and you will really get a good workout if you can keep up and make it to the end! You will also use your abs a lot. I am sure you would lose weight if you did these regularly.",1190592000,9,882,4.21301775147929
2805281,4,B000OYCMMG,I like the workouts and the energy--a lot.  But somehow my 3-mile DVD has the voice not completely synced with the video.  It's off by a fraction of a second and that gets annoying if you're watching and listening for the cues.,1190246400,3,227,4.380952380952381
2805282,2,B000OYCMMG,"I now have seven diff. Leslie Workouts and normally I love them, not so with this one. It seems production was rushed and it did not get any editing as I can see the camera guy cruising by in the background no less than 2-3 times in the two mile walk. Also as other reviews have noted, the two dvd's ARE MISLABLED which shows lack of attention or care. Leslie does not act like herself in these two workouts either. She's way too goofy and out of it, chatting about who knows what while she's out of step and changing things up without letting us know. I tried to do the 3 mile tonight but after just 3 minutes of it I was so annoyed at the program I had to take it out and put in her walk/jog dvd instead. My favorite leslie workouts are Walk/Jog and 3 mile for Abs. They are terrific but this one is not!",1189209600,13,806,4.04375
2805283,5,B000OYCMMG,I have at least a dozen of the Walk Away the Pounds DVDs and I have to say this one was even better than I expected. It's fast paced and the new music is a welcome change. The only thing that was a little funny was that my DVDs are labeled wrong. The one and two mile is labeled three mile and vice versa. I thought that was weird and my husband suggested sending them back for correctly labeled ones but I like them so much I didn't want to wait on them again so I just kept them. As far as the workout goes though I felt it was excellent. Miss Leslie hasn't lost her touch!,1188864000,,575,3.923076923076923
2805284,5,B000OYCMMG,"I am new to Leslie Sansone's walk at home DVDs and I have to say, I really love the Fast Start 1 & 2 Mile Walk!  I just started the program, so I have not worked up to the 3 Fast Miles, but I am looking forward to it. I feel energized without feeling exhausted.  My whole body got a great workout.  I have no doubts that I am going to feel better and look better in no time by continuing with these workouts daily, and they're low impact which is perfect for me because I have Lupus.  God bless Leslie.",1187568000,4,502,3.9405940594059405
2805285,3,B000OYCMMG,"The two and three mile workouts are good, get your heart rate up and you really do work up a sweat, but it really gripes me to hear Leslie saying ""good girl"" and calling 40+ year old women ""sweetie"".  If not for that I would give this DVD 5 stars.  Come on Leslie, you're not leading exercise for grammar school kids.",1186876800,6,317,4.180327868852459
2805306,5,B000OYCMMG,I have been working out with Leslie's walking vidoes for 4 years now and love her workouts.  One of the things I love about this set is the different music and the fast pace.  It's also great that you can select specific chapters and do individual mile workouts if you don't have a lot of time.,1186704000,8,294,4.232142857142857
2805307,4,B000OYCMMG,"My discs in this two-disc set are labeled backwards, but play fine. This is the first WATP disc I've bought in over a year, and I'm glad I got it. The music is faster and there are some new moves. I like doing the two-mile walk with weights to boost the workout instead of going to ""boosted walking"" aka jogging. Too bad neither workout includes weights. I don't like the fact that the music for the cool downs is as fast as the regular workout. Otherwise, this is a great addition to my WATP workout collection.",1184976000,5,512,4.34375
2805308,5,B000OYCMMG,I like this one as you have all sorts of different workout combinations you can do and you can choose to do it with music only and no chit chat...sometimes I like the encouragement though so I do it with the chit chat.  Both DVD's in this set make me sweat...and now I like to sweat!,1184112000,5,283,4.053571428571429
2805309,3,B000OYCMMG,"I have a lot of Leslie's videos and I've always loved every one- until I got this one.  I'm overweight and not a big exerciser so it does get me to sweat, but I don't feel that I'm getting a total workout.  Her other videos incorporate hand weights and work the arms along the way as well. I feel I've accomplished more at the end of those videos.  I also don't like in this video that it gives the option of a 1 or 2 mile walk, but if you choose to stop after 1 mile there is no way to get to the cool down- you just stop in the middle of a brisk walk.  Try one of Leslie's older videos and I think you'll be happier.",1184025600,5,618,3.8046875
2805310,4,B000OYCMMG,"I first learned about Leslie's work outs through an ON Demand 10 minute workout that was on my cable program. I did it for a few days and loved it!  I have been doing this 1 & 2 mile walk for the past few days and I am sore (which is a great thing). I even had my boyfriend to try it one day and he was sweating like crazy and said that his abs have never been that sore! I love this DVD! I haven't had a chance to look at the 3 mile DVD that came along with it yet, but I am sure its just as great.

At times Leslie does get a little carried away with the talking, and interacting with Jimmy. But after a few workouts you will ignore it. But there is an option on the DVD where u can have the whole workout where the its only music and you cannot hear her talking, If the talking is distracting you too much.",1183939200,5,809,3.7810650887573964
2805311,5,B000OYCMMG,"I have been ""Walking Away the Pounds"" for a few years now and this is one of the BEST workouts from Leslie.  It brings your workout to a higher level of intensity which is great.  If you are short on time, you can do the 1 or 2 mile which is only 35 minutes or so. And the 3 mile is only 45 minutes.  It really gets you sweating, boosts your metabolism, boosts your mood, boosts your energy and spirit and gives you a great boost to your day!",1183507200,6,442,3.943820224719101
2805312,2,B000OYCMMG,"Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Leslie Sansone and her workouts are the only ones I can do.  I'm sure Leslie wants to hear feedback from her fans regarding her workouts so here it goes:  I was disappointed with the Walk Slim Fast Start 1 and 2 Mile DVD workout.  I think Leslie needs a better production company.  Doesn't Leslie solicit feedback from a test audience before selling her DVDs to the public?  The studio was dark and dreary.  Leslie was acting too silly and she spoke way too much to ""Jimmy"" practically ignoring everyone else.  It really got on my nerves.  Her cues were also off.  The Walk-Away-the Pounds DVDs are probably the best produced.",1183507200,10,660,4.4789915966386555
2805313,3,B000OYCMMG,"I really enjoy Leslie Sansone dvds.  I like the Walk Slim 1&2 mile, but the 3 mile is a not for me.  In the 3 mile workout, the music, the walkers and the addition of new steps all over the place just left me feeling frantic instead of energized.  However, the 1&2 mile is classic but improved Leslie Sansone.  Just a heads up though, it is really one workout.  Specifically, the 1 mile chapter option just brings you into the already started 2 mile walk.  Now the 2 mile walk I really liked. I liked the music, the pace, the steps, the intervals, all of the walkers, her chatter, all of it.  The intervals are, of course, periods of higher intensity exercise followed by recovery exercise.  I really feel that the low impact version is the same as in her past videos - she just never called it out as such.  But there has often been periods of more intensity and then back to walking. The great thing is that it really isn't distracting to have some walkers do the high impact and others the low impact.  I only became a bit distracted for a very short instant during the third interval when 4 of 6 were doing high impact.
On a side note, the DVDs I received wer mislabeled. The disc for the 3 mile really had the 1/2 mile on it and vice versa.  I am returning the discs to Amazon.  Maybe I will buy again at a brick store for easy return in case I get another one like this.  P.S. My favorite leslie Sansone are express 4 mile super challenge and WATP 3 mile fat burner.",1182470400,47,1472,4.214285714285714
2805314,3,B000OYCMMG,I own many of Leslie Sansone's walking videos and this is one I really don't like.  She just talks too much!  She talked so much she didn't allow you to slide easily into the next step.  Don't recommend.,1181520000,11,203,4.2894736842105265
2805315,5,B000OYCMMG,"I own several Leslie DVD's and REALLY, REALLY enjoy the faster pace of these two workouts (2 mile and 3 mile.)  The two mile workout comes in at about 30 minutes, and the three mile workout is about 45 minutes; neither is choreographically challenging, but you will work up a good sweat!  Leslie is as chatty as ever, the music is better than ever, and the setting is ... updated!  The interesting camera work and black background give it a fresh, modern look different from the ""garden patio"" or ""window"" settings of her other workouts ... and it's just plain fun!",1181174400,34,565,4.574257425742574
8187555,5,B000OYCMMG,"This is my favorite Leslie workout. I do the 2-mile nearly every morning. The exercisers are mature (I don't like the DVDs with young people and silly dance moves), and I can do a ""music only"" workout which means I don't have to listen to Leslie's goofy giggles and diatribes about how much she loves to sweat. Leslie's walks are great for so many reasons, but sometimes she's too much to listen to at 5 AM.",1437264000,2,407,4.368421052631579
8187556,5,B000OYCMMG,I love this these videos.  I like the fact that the 'walkers' are just ordinary people like me who come in all shapes and sizes.  Leslie is also a great motivator and I like the fact that all the of the walking/moves can be done low impact.,1408233600,,240,4.085106382978723
8187557,5,B000OYCMMG,"I own many of Leslie's workout DVDs, and this is definitely my favorite. The Fast Start consists of a 2-mile indoor walking workout with the option of skipping of ending after 1-mile if you're a beginner or pressed for time. The workouts include a warm up and cool down and bursts of higher intensity ""boosted walking."" Leslie's workouts are very easy to learn. Anyone can do this, no matter your fitness level. Leslie offers a lot of motivation, health tips, and positive thinking along the way. There is a music only option, which is nice because after you've seen the workout a few times you may not want to hear the chatter anymore.

One great thing about the Walk Slim system is the success stories from the real people who have gotten fit using Leslie's easy walking workouts. Fast Start ends with three of the walkers talking about their loss of 60 to 110 pounds from walking. I enjoy exercising along with these regular women (and one man!) and feeling like I can accomplish my goals, too.",1388620800,,997,4.632768361581921

(I was one of those individuals.)  She has helped me, and although she does like to talk, big deal.  She offers motivation and encouragement.  I have several of her DVDS.  Thanks Leslie and fellow walkers!

8187560,5,B000OYCMMG,"I first saw a walking you tube of Leslie's on realage.com an tried it out, but it was frustrating as my screen saver used to come on.  I then discovered that she was available via my TV with on demand so was walking the same one mile as I had done in the past.  I have always been an exercise junkie, but injuries prevented me from doing what I had in the past so pretty much became a power walker in the nice weather.  I decided to buy the DVD as the weather had been dreary and I could walk inside as well as do my exercise bike.  It was far better then I had anticipated as it is more then just power walking, but a good aerobic work out which I missed doing and this was not something that would be harmful to me.  I have only done the 2 miles, looking forward to the 3 miles as the 2 miles is a breeze.  I love how she instructs and motivates you with her smile and energy.  Best of all I have no excuse not to workout as I do my stretches in the morning as I always have done , put in the DVD without the need to change into workout clothes and get going.  It has now been a routine to do it every day no matter what and I feel like I am a junkie once more.",1308096000,,1163,3.796680497925311

I'd recommend this for anyone who wants to boost metabolism and just get up off your couch.",1297987200,,371,4.3478260869565215
8187563,4,B000OYCMMG,"This is a combination set with 2 DVDs.  The first has a 2 miles walk on it with mile markers so you can stop after 1 mile.  This is a basic Leslie two mile walk with some intervals of faster moves.  The 2 miles take 30 minutes to complete.  The second DVD is 3 fast miles and I really like this one.  You get the 3 miles done in 35 minutes with a 5 minute warm up and a 5 minute cool down.  The pacing is fast and the music is great--probably some of the best music Leslie has on any of her DVDs.  Leslie is quite chatty and the whole walk is done with a group of women that you see in lots of her DVDs, plus her daughter and her niece.  It's a fun, fast 3 miles.",1297036800,2,663,3.7194244604316546
8187564,3,B000OYCMMG,"I have mixed feelings about this set. I LOVE the first disc, which is 2 miles, its all one workout, but it tells you when you hit 1 mile so you can stop. I love the music, I love the boosted walking (jogging). She gets a little gabby a couple of times but after watching it a few times you basically know what to expect. It also has a music only option which is great when you get sick of the chatter.
The most disappointing is the 2nd disc that has the 3 miles on it. It has different walkers, including ones you have seen before, her daughter and her niece. The music is set a bit faster, but it still seemed like slow 3 miles to me even though I felt I got a good workout. There is NO boosted walking on the 3 mile disc, no add on's either such as the resistance bands. Also I don't know if its just my disc but the audio and video are off about 3 seconds, so it makes it hard, because you feel you are off. It might be just that I got a bad batch, but this was irritating to me. She also does this really fun mambo move that I wish you would see in other dvds of hers, I could really feel it working my legs and hip area.
Also like other reviewers said she has Mary Kay take over at one point, and she doesn't have a mike. And you are basically guessing about what she is going to do. Pointing to the left tells me nothing when its the first time I'm doing the DVD. The cool down is a little off too. The pace doesn't seem to slow down enough, and it seems to be irritating Leslie...
Overall I am glad I got it for the first disc, but I have to say I'm really disappointed with the second disc.",1281312000,,1598,3.9049079754601226
