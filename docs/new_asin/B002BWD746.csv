3896099,5,B002BWD746,"I've always been a fan of the classic play of the same name, so I was excited that an anime adaption was in the works. But I never expected anything like this... I've been enjoying anime for many years, and I don't think any other series I've watched has moved and warmed my heart more than ""Romeo x Juliet.""

William Shakespear's classic tale of these two star crossed lovers is taken to a whole new level of excitement, action, suspence, and romance--all housed within a two volume DVD set. Romeo is a young noblemen and the son of the ruthless Prince Montegue who has brought the helpless and innocent people of Neo Verona to their knees. Juliet is the last surviving member of the slain Capulat family and Neo Verona's only hope for a brighter future. Although they are supposed to despise one another, these two young people simply cannot deny the strong love that they instantly share for each other upon their first meeting. But as they fight to keep their love alive against all odds, will they also be able to end the reign of the vicious tirant Prince Montegue?

This adaption is very loosly based on the play, so not everything is entirely by-the-book. But in the end, the moral of the story is still the same: that the power of true love is strong enough to overcome all obsticals, no matter what.

What more can I say, other than this is an amazing buy! But words really don't do this anime justice--You have to WATCH it. I highly reccomend this product. It may be a little pricey, but you will not regret it!",1258329600,,1522,4.487364620938628

I had a few doubt going into this series, but my misgivings were quickly put to rest, I thought it might turn out like the Leonardo DiCaprio movie Romeo and Juliet, the movie was pretty bad. Thankfully the anime series is a whole lot better.

Romeo X Juliet is a extraordinary anime series. There is the same story of two waring families, and the two children from the families falling in love. There are so many things that make this a great anime series. First the story, sure there's the same classic story, but GONZO added much more and new twists to the story. The world the anime series takes place in is wonderful. A mysterious land floating in the sky, winged horse, and of course the Tree called Escalus. The mystery behind the floating land is the real story. The love story, between Romeo and Juliet is just a added benefit.

The characters were also amazing. GONZO brought many changes to them, adding more life to them than in the classic play. Characters from Lady Portia(Romeo's Mother), William, Ophelia, and many more.

Next is the music, which is excellent on par with Fullmetal Alchemist, but a notch below Cowboy Bebop.

Finally the animation is done by GONZO. The did a stunning job with Romeo X Juliet, it just amazes me how good a job they do.

Overall Romeo and Juliet is a classic anime series, and is in my top 5 anime series I've seen",1257724800,,1436,4.546511627906977
3896101,5,B002BWD746,Very good adaptation of William Shakespeare's Rome & Juliet into an Anime style and with a few twists.  The drawing style and techniques were very good and I enjoyed the voice talents for the English dubbed. There was quite a bit of character development throughout the series not just with the main characters but with secondary characters as well.  I don't remember there being any loose ends at the end with any of the characters which is always a big plus.  I don't want to give anything away but will definitely enjoy this set - speaking of both parts together which make up the complete series.  Thanks!,1255392000,,609,4.663551401869159
3896102,4,B002BWD746,"Funimation has to be credited for their ability to drop anime DVD collections in a timely manner.  After all, patience may be a virtue but who wants to wait around to find out how a story they're waist-deep in concludes?  Such was the case with Romeo x Juliet.  The first collection (known as the Romeo Collection) hit streets on June 23rd and now the concluding set is at our collective disposal as of August 11.

Romeo x Juliet from Funimation breaks the 24 total episodes into a pair of two-disc sets. The second of which (reviewed here) is known as The Juliet Collection and contains episodes 13-24. Packaged within an appropriately artistically decorated cardboard exterior slipcase is a pair of thin disc cases each containing a single dvd (with 6 episodes on each).

Total runtime comes in at 290 minutes and the show wears a conservative TV PG (13+) rating, based presumably more on the grander adult oriented themes (we do all know how this tale will end) than it is language, sexual scenarios, or gore.

Language options are standard fair sub & dub meaning the original Japanese dialog track is presented (in stereo) as well as the option of instead watching an English dub (in Dolby Surround 5.1). Finally English subtitles are available with either vocal option.

Extras include an English actor commentary track over Act (episode) 24, textless songs, and a host of Funimation trailers on the second disc.

As was the case with the first collection, the source material here deviates from the original William Shakespeare play while retaining many of the same fundamental concepts of forbidden love, dictatorship governments, and the agony of heartbreak.

In this installment Prince Montague sentences the captured Juliet to death, which of course spurs her faithful comrades into rescue efforts. For simply aiding in Juliet's escape, Romeo finds himself exiled to the grueling Gradisca mines.

Though ripped apart from one another, both Romeo and Juliet focus their efforts to create a world where they can be together while Juliet cements a Capulet strike against Montague complete with the return of her vigilante alter ego, the Red Whirlwind.

While the human factions battle each other for control, Neo Verona itself is crumbling as Escalus, the tree that supports everything, begins to wither and die beneath their very feet.

Pacing in the show's second half is much grander in terms of scale and scope when compared to that of the first 12 episodes.  The love interest between the title characters definitely blossoms into a more believable/ less forced relationship here even as the underlying chaos that surrounds them builds to a fever pitch.

Without giving away too many spoilers, I will say to expect some of the tragic nature of the source material to not only carry over but to become a literal ultimatum faced by the characters by the show's dramatic conclusion.

However, I really don't wish to insinuate that the entire Juliet Collection serves as a funnel to the inevitable conclusion; in fact the truth is quite the contrary.  Thanks to the fact that this half of the tale once again consists of a full 12 episodes should hint toward the truth that the voyage is every bit as rewarding as the arrival.

I was particularly moved by the sequences that focused on Romeo's torture in the mines, as they appear to have been lifted from some of the finer science fiction films of yore and work very well here.  Juliet's isolated plots were a bit drier and more politically under-toned but I suspect some may find this to be the more enjoyable.

Prince Montague's tyranny really comes into fruition in this installment as well; a credit to Gonzo's ability to paint realistic characters (love them or hate them).

Like in the first half, the artistry is by no means spectacular but it does work within this setting with emphasis on textures and background detail, sometimes at the cost of the moment.  The musical score however continues to build both in scale and mood.  Ultimately, it comes off as a very well constructed symphonic score that manages to impress (even in the show's darker moments).

Once again I'm left with mixed feelings on the occasional old-English/ Shakespearean-inspired dialog on the English dub, which may actually be superior to the original Japanese dialog (a rarity in the anime world).  It's not quite as glaring an inconsistency as it was in the first installment, but it without fail makes the viewer wonder if it would have worked better to quit resisting and just perform the entire show that way or to avoid any and all references to that era and simply do away with it entirely.

The English voice cast commentary track is great in terms of demonstrating just what a highly anticipated project the show was to Funimation.  It's funny to hear that nearly everyone on staff did their absolute best in the hopes of snagging one of the lead roles.  Of course the producers had to narrow it down and surely there were those lowly voice actors left feeling like the last person on the wall during team selection of a gym class dodge ball game.

In all, this is a must have for those who watched, loved, liked, or even just barely got through the first half.  For everyone else, this is definitely above average anime as a whole and now that the full 24-epiodes are available, this would be the perfect opportunity to get involved.  After all, virtuous or otherwise, waiting for a show's conclusion bites.",1249948800,11,5460,4.858683926645091

8362141,5,B002BWD746,"Unlike Shakespeare's R&J, this one redevelops the characters and plot. The two lovers are not as one dimensional and emotionally foolish as the original ones. They have a reason to fight and die for each other. They understand that their love conflicts with social interests but tend to the world's needs first. Instead of madly expressing their love at first, as portrayed in the original R&J, this is magnified towards the end of the story. This shift in love redeems ""Romeo & Juliet"" as a true love story where you ""promise you won't let go.""",1295222400,,545,4.747368421052632

8362143,5,B002BWD746,This part of the serious had a ton of issues in my opinion. Compared to the first part. My overall rating goes towards the serious. Spoiler alert. If you are watching this serious please do not read all of this. If you want to know my issue before you start then here you go. This series makes some huge jumps from the down to earth to the plain crazy. There is no leading up to this. Just this sudden apocalypse! It really is insane. This series was so strong. The voiceovers were great and the music I found astounding. The fighting picks up and everyone suddenly begins to feel the consequences of their choices. It made me think of my own choices. A lot of people feel that you shouldn't connect to shows but shows in my opinion are like a book. I need to get into it...if I can't then there is no point. Romeo and Juliet is a story everyone can relate too. Even if you aren't in love are haven't been. You can see the friendships build and how easy they crumble. How new worlds are made. It truly is astounding and can make people think and even inspire younger crowds to join new movements. This show brought these ideas to me and they can do the same for you.,1283126400,3,1166,4.233183856502242
