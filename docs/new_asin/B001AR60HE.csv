8468097,4,B001AR60HE,I bought the cheap (no graphics or pretty boxes) version.  I wish they had done the minimum and marked the top -- just a dot or something.  I am marking them as I play them because of that (Sharpie works).  Quality is great -- but remember these are very old to old fights -- any lack of quality existed on the original and I don't think this vendor is responsible.  No bad discs -- no skips -- so far so good.  I am only 1/2 way through.  As the fights get newer the quality is increasing.,1508716800,,490,4.052083333333333
8468098,5,B001AR60HE,This is a great inspiring movie.,1492473600,,32,4.5
8468099,1,B001AR60HE,"hardly any boxing footage (virtually no fighting footage), he is featured on the video but the emphasis is on his personal life. The quality (video/audio) is fine but lacks boxing substance/footage/coverage.",1489017600,,207,5.709677419354839
8468100,4,B001AR60HE,"I thought the Chavez Documentary was well done , but NOT the best. J.V.O.",1435881600,,73,4.285714285714286
8468101,1,B001AR60HE,This documentary does very little justice for the great champion he was. He had many great fights. He fought everyone in his divisions. They showed his worst moments of his life. I would not recommend this to a fan.,1414713600,,215,4.538461538461538
8468102,4,B001AR60HE,THIS IS A VERY GOOD AND ENTERTAINING MOVIE. THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST VERY  DELIGHTIFUL TO WATCH. AND I REALLY LIKED IT...,1363651200,,121,4.761904761904762
8468103,3,B001AR60HE,"This is more a political documentary instead of a boxing one.
I would like to have seen more of the important fights (vs Macho for example) than the Colosio case.",1284508800,3,162,4.433333333333334
8468104,5,B001AR60HE,"I felt like it wasn't long at all. Not a good thing. I also feel that they didn't capture his highlights, it seem as if they just highlighted his failures. It was heart breaking In one part I even wanted to Cry. I love J.C Chavez",1237593600,3,229,4.0
8468105,1,B001AR60HE,worst I have ever seen. no fight scenes to speak of .  a horrible tribute to a great champion,1227398400,4,93,3.8947368421052633
