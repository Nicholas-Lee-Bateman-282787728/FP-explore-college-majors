2258117,1,B0008ENI0C,"This film should be compulsory viewing for anyone who wants to know how NOT to make a film. Or choreograph action scenes. Or write dialogue. Or do anything even remotely related to creating a coherent, meaningful piece of cinema. Cold & Dark is dominated by Luke Goss's macho posturing. He basically spends the majority of the film scampering about in a woolly hat, with his gun drawn, grunting lines of truly appalling dialogue. Kevin Howarth passes the time standing atop a crane, (for reasons known only to the director), with a black trenchcoat billowing around him. I guess he's supposed to appear all moody and windswept, but given the fact that he has no real reason to be atop a crane, you'll spend a lot of time scratching your head and mumbling, ""Oh, look, there he is on that crane again. Why? And who is responsible for that hideous harmonica music?"" The love interest is a rake-thin woman by the name of Agent Bianca Albany. Luke Goss attempts to get into her panties by grunting yet more lines of stomach-churningly bad dialogue. The only reason Agent Albany consents to sleep with Goss's character is because it's in the script. If she were a fully developed character rather than an embarrassing caricature, she'd call him a drooling mongoloid and knee him in the groin. I suspect that happens to Luke Goss a lot.

The film's pacing is relentlessly uneven. Either you're bored stiff, or you've no idea what's been happening for the past 20 minutes. It actually plays more like a music video and was obviously edited by a rabid methamphetamine junkie wielding a meat cleaver. The special FX are passable, but nothing to write home about. In truth, the only actor worth watching during this entire travesty is Matt Lucas, whose role as a professor of paranormal phenomena is both hilarious and well-acted. The rest of the cast could be effortlessly replaced by sock puppets, who would undoubtedly be more suited to a screenplay so bad I wouldn't use it to wipe my backside were I suffering from a bout of chronic diarrhoea. This film is amusing in an ""Oh my God, I can't believe he actually said that with a straight face!"" sort of way. Other than that, it's a film you endure rather than enjoy, and anyone watching it more than once is a hopeless masochist.",1143331200,7,2272,4.708542713567839
2258118,4,B0008ENI0C,"Just goes to show you don't need big stars to make a great film. Kevin Howarth is amazing and Luke Goss shows he has some real acting chops. The plot does twist and turn but stick with it - it is worth it. Begs for a sequel but as it never made it to the bid screen, I guess that won't happen. Real shame. I want more.",1142812800,3,318,3.7611940298507465
2258119,4,B0008ENI0C,"I am an investor in this film and its the first time I have seen it.  There is a new version coming out with Matt Lucas as the dubbing voice, but the finaciers are trying to pull the film because they have stolen money from the investors.  it is a great film and having met Michael Gabauer it would be a shame for it to be wasted.  Well worth watching",1128470400,,351,3.9857142857142858
2258120,4,B0008ENI0C,"Luke Goss is a stand-out star in this film. I bought the film knowing nothing about it and it was a real surprise, a lot of sexy people for a Brit horror pic. Really enjoyed it. Get's better each time you see it. Give it a try.",1127433600,5,227,3.851063829787234

2258122,4,B0008ENI0C,"I liked it, it was different to the crap that we're usually sold as British horror. The story was more complex that average but the characters were so good (and wierd) that i was involved all the way through. Loved Luke Goss and the guy who plays Mort - briliant brilliant performances. The directing style was ballsy, loved it. Will watch more from Andrew Goth.",1127433600,7,362,4.584615384615384
2258123,2,B0008ENI0C,"This movie I don't know what was going on for the simple fact that the pace just seemed so horrible. this movie when I looked at the time said 25 minutes felt like more than an hour to only look ten minutes later when it felt like 20 minutes. The pace to this movie was just insanley bad there was no action for 3/4 of the movie which made it even worse. I had a very hard time watching it but some how finished watching it. This movie basically drags very bad along with no action and its just very hard boring to watch and actually enjoy, rrent b4 buy thats a fact, because if you spend 22$ on this you are out of your flippin mind and will be highly dissapointed. Want a good horror movie I could name plenty but  one I just rented recently was Session 9 and that was an absolutley excellent movie. If you want buy Session 9 instead of Cold and Dark. Like I said there are plenty, dozens of better movies iI could namne but won't get into it. But for a newer type horror that don't get what it deserves is Session 9 released in 2001. check it out.",1121558400,,1050,4.072463768115942

8055774,4,B0008ENI0C,A quirky and fresh take of vampires and demons with a police corruption procedural back drop. Why isn't Luke Gos a bigger action star?,1470873600,,134,4.625
8055775,4,B0008ENI0C,Very good,1459209600,,9,4.0
8055776,4,B0008ENI0C,Unusual and unexpected from the storyline to the atmosphere. Luke Goss is excellent as a cop with hero worship adjusting to his hero becoming a monster. The monster special effects are very dated and silly by today's standards but that is only a couple of minutes of an otherwise entertaining film.,1436313600,,298,4.862745098039215

8055779,4,B0008ENI0C,"I read some of the reviews before buying this movie and I am glad I did , I just did not agree with most of the reviews I did see what some of the viewers where talking about (lighting, dialogue,etc)but over all it was a fair movie. Again Luke Goss pretty much carried the whole thing for me I thought the story line very original (even believable to an extent) by no means is this the best movie of this type that I have seen but it still was interesting if you have nothing else to do on a Friday night. I recommend renting it unless like me you collect every movie featuring Luke Goss good bad or ugly!",1304899200,,605,4.092436974789916
8055780,2,B0008ENI0C,"Cold and Dark (Andrew Goth, 2005)

I was all set to give Cold and Dark a typical awful review, because it was a typical awful movie. Then, suddenly, like a ray of light in the murky stupidity of this well-below-average monster movie, we got Lardeson Dahl, played by the wonderful Michael Culkin (Mrs. Henderson Presents, Candyman, An Ideal Husband, et al.). While I can't say this about any other part of the movie, the character of Lardeson Dahl is quirky, intelligent, fantastic, and will stay with me for years. He's enough to make me bump the rating for this movie up an entire star. I wish there'd been more of him.

The plot: a couple of cops, John Dark (Unearthed's Luke Goss) and Mortimer Shade (Last Orders' Kevin Howarth), get involved in a nasty battle, during which Shade is killed. He gets right up and starts doing his job again posthaste, though, because he's now the host for a particularly bloodthirsty parasite. And if you're a particularly bloodthirsty parasite, who better to inhabit than the body of a police officer who deals with violent crimes?

The bulk of the film veers back and forth between ""boring"", ""predictable"", and ""slightly less boring""; if you don't know that Dark (I'm kind of surprised Shade's last name isn't actually ""Cold""; point for scriptwriter Joanne Reay there) is going to have some sort of crisis of faith when he finds out his partner is no longer fully human, then you haven't seen enough buddy-cop movies (or haven't been paying attention). The appearance of Lardeson Dahl in the movie signals that things are going to get interesting, and when we meet the paranormal-obsessed doctor (Shaun of the Dead's Matt Lucas)in the last third of the film, I hoped that it was suddenly going to get awesome. I was wrong, but at least I had that little spark of hope. And I still have Lardeson Dahl. **",1263600000,,1841,4.728971962616822

Yup, a whole lot of nothing.",1158278400,,104,3.9523809523809526
8055782,1,B0008ENI0C,"30 minutes into Cold and Dark, I still had no clue what the plot was nor knew anything interesting about the characters. There are few films that bore me to tears in the first half an hour, but Cold and Dark did so.

There is not much to say about the film, as most every aspect was not but, but more so dull. The plot did a lot of telling and not showing. The actor's dialog was often mumbled, and when it was heard I had a hard time figuring out what there words meant (or brought) to the plot.

The actors seemed like they were fairly decent, but were given absolutely nothing to work with.

Cold and Dark is of one the worst films I have seen this year. There are too many other films waiting for your hard earned money. Pass on it, please.
