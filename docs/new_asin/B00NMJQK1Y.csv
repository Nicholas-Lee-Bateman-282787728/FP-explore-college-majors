8679160,5,B00NMJQK1Y,"An excellent tween show my kids and I can all agree on.  No obnoxious language, sarcasm or poorly delivered jokes.  Just smart girls doing smart things.  Highly recommend for boys and girls alike (because let's face it -- boys seeing smart girls doing smart things will only ever be a good thing!) for multiple ages.",1424131200,3,316,4.709090909090909
