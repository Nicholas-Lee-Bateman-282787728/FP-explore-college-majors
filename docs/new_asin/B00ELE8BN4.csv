5927107,5,B00ELE8BN4,"This is one hell of a documentary for threal green day fans.  It shows stuff never seen before from the greatest rock band of its time. I swear, to all true punks out there, this is the real deal, enjoy!!",1382227200,,204,4.1
5927108,5,B00ELE8BN4,Love that you get this little window to look at the process of how their trilogy was made. Very good buy for Green Day fans.,1381363200,,124,4.0
5927109,5,B00ELE8BN4,"I bought this item the day it came out and was very excited about it after watching the trailers for it. I had high expectations for this documentary, and it surpassed them all. This is by far the most personal look at Green Day the fans have ever gotten to see. It shows them in the studio, working on various songs from the trilogy, and also takes you through the process of what it was like for them when deciding to do a triple album. It very much captures their state of mind in that time period and gives you a whole new respect for the albums and the band alike. This is Green Day like you've never seen them before. In the studio, behind the scenes, and also on stage while they play the new, unfamiliar songs to unsuspecting fans in everything to dingy clubs and small venues from the likes of the Kerplunk! days to an Oakland arena where you're used to seeing them in this era.
This is by far, a must have for all Green Day fans. It will give you a whole new perspective on the albums and a new love for the band as a whole. It's amazing to see the process behind these monumental albums.",1380326400,12,1098,4.183962264150943
5927110,5,B00ELE8BN4,"I have every CD and DVD about Green Day and this is my favorite.  Bullet in a Bible and Awesome as F*** were great concert DVD's, but this is a little bit more.  One reviewer said it's ""not really a Making of Uno, Dos, Tre"" documentary, but they missed the point...
The fact that Green Day were making these new albums as they played shows actually IS a making of DVD.  Instead of playing their usual arena crowds, they'd play small clubs and see what the reaction of the new songs were.  You can see audience members holding up lyrics for the new songs in front of Billie, so you're actually seeing the process from the ground up seeing the band in a different light.  Whereas the other 2 DVD's are concerts AFTER the millions of albums sold, these are short snippets of shows BEFORE the albums were even out.
You see Billie Joe in his little home studio recording demos on his computer...a ""rough draft"" so to speak of ""missing you"".  You see him record his guitar, bass, and even drums.  The next scene is him introducing it to the rest of the band and how it sounds, discussing the middle break where maybe Mike can have a little bass solo, and coming up with the idea ""Hey that would be a great time for Tre to do a drum part"" and then they have the band play the song all put together.
You see the band discussing the thought process behind the order of the songs and theme of the trilogy.  You see the band worrying that if they allow cameras and recording devices to their small shows that their songs will be leaked.
The band discusses the mistakes they've made in the past and how they wanted to get back to just pure rock and roll.
I love this DVD and it is a true ""making of"" without too much documentary and without too much concert footage.",1380153600,11,1754,4.293939393939394

5927113,2,B00ELE8BN4,"I'm a big Green Day fan, but I had trouble watching this all the way through.  It only briefly touches on making Uno, Dos, and Tre, and the vast majority is just concert footage or scenes of the band goofing off.  It's not really a documentary, but more of an hour long music video.  I love Green Day's music, but this was not really any type of movie I'd recommend to others.  I watched it once and doubt I'll ever watch it again.",1378166400,9,431,4.156626506024097

5927116,2,B00ELE8BN4,"I like Green Day but this album is not very good.  While Green Day is not known for being great lyricists, this group of albums they put out within a year is by far their worst.  Within the four albums I found only a handful of songs I enjoy listening to.  I hope they tried to do too much at once versus this is the preview of future albums.",1419465600,,342,3.927536231884058

5927124,5,B00ELE8BN4,"A lot of people have slammed Green Day for their ""new"" sound and the fact that Uno, Dos, and Tre were not as ""political"" as other works.  To them I say watch Cuatro, the whole trilogy of albums becomes very clear and you will understand the thought process as well as the artistry that went in to all three albums.",1412726400,2,314,4.233333333333333

5927129,5,B00ELE8BN4,These guys blow me away. Ive been a fan for 20 years and this truly is the first time we get a look inside their recording. These guys are so talented and its really cool to see how Billie Joe works in the studio.  LOVE. The editing is great too. Must have for a Green Day and music fan.,1397520000,5,287,3.864406779661017
5927130,5,B00ELE8BN4,"I'm getting to learn about Green Day 20 years after they started and I like this band very much.  Their series of 3 CDs in 2012-13 has some really fantastic music and it was a bold move to release them.  Not too many bands have the courage do that anymore, and consequently, I give them a ton of credit for taking a chance.  IT PAID OFF!!!  The companion DVD shows an insight and maturity into the recording process and is fun to watch.  If you a fan of Green Day, treat yourself to this film.  You won't be sorry.",1396828800,6,514,4.141414141414141
5927131,4,B00ELE8BN4,"If you like Uno, Dos, Tre then you have to get this documentary on the make of the albums. The film is a bit disjointed when they cut off songs in the middle, but overall this is a tribute to all the great songs that are on the albums. If you are a big Green Day fan like me, you will want to get this DVD. Highly recommended.",1396137600,,326,3.8088235294117645

5927133,4,B00ELE8BN4,"It was really inspirational to see how it was like they had to start over and prove themselves again. If you have seen the trailer like I did, the actual thing is a little bit different than what you expect, which is why I had to rate it only 4 stars instead of 5.",1390262400,2,264,3.9074074074074074

Go for the purchase, it's not a bad deal.

Clearly this band has incredible talent and a lot of fun doing what they do! If you are a Green Day fan - you will enjoy it, if you are not a Green Day fan.....you should be - you are missing out on one of the best bands ever!",1389484800,,371,3.6835443037974684

5927138,4,B00ELE8BN4,"Cuatro is billed as a documentary film about the making of the Uno, Dos, Tre trilogy and to some extent it keeps that promise. There are a fair amount of insider looks at the band in the studio and playing live sets in small clubs to work out the songs.

High points are the band members working on various parts of songs in their early development, and discussing the order of songs on the CDs. Also, there are some good moments featuring Green Day live in small clubs.

Low points are clips of the band members doing ""spontaneous"" pranks where you would expect hilarity and hi-jinx to inevitably ensue, but these clips come across as contrived. Also, I don't think the live videos ever show a song more than halfway through, they are literally short 10-20 second clips, which is very frustrating. Hopefully a true, live DVD is on its way using the arena shows Green Day played on their tour.

I gave this a 4-star review because if you are a Green Day fan, you will still enjoy this DVD and find some parts of it very interesting. Lackluster Green Day material is still better than the best material from 90% of bands.",1385856000,8,1120,4.480392156862745

5927142,5,B00ELE8BN4,"This is classic Green Day! Don't get me wrong, American Idiot is my favorite album, but Uno, Dos, and Tre is where they bring it back to where they started. I love their 3 new albums and Cuatro makes it all the more awesome: It's the making of the 3 newest albums. From laying down the tracks, recording them and performing the songs for the first time. If you want to see what it would be like to be in the studio with Green Day, then this is the DVD for you! Any die hard Green Day fan will love it. I know I do!

8606611,5,B00ELE8BN4,"This is a pretty cool look at what went on during the making of these three awesome CDs (Uno, Dos, and Tre).  The only thing that seemed strange to me was that Brutal Love wasn't represented on the DVD at all.  Just a curiosity since it's one of my favorite songs.

What would have been really cool is a Bullet in a Bible-type live concert recording of these songs.  I would be really excited to see that!",1505001600,,405,4.220779220779221
