4687710,4,B005G4FFBE,"Update - Now 4 stars to reflect series not price.

One of the funniest, most thoughtful and educational shows of the past 25 years. Teens and young adults could learn from this. How about you make it affordable for all.

If I calculate the newest and highest priced (season 7) 16.99 x 7 seasons, currently 16.99 x 7 seasons = $119. Amazon price $152. No deal.

Stop trying to package something that is cheaper to make now (because you already have the rights and technology) and sell it to us for more. What is this the blu-ray version?

Price aside, this is a great show that everyone should watch. Don't try to rob the little people.",1319328000,17,635,4.448275862068965
4687711,3,B005G4FFBE,I really want the seiries so I did some calculating since you can get the series all at once or buy individually. I came up with about 105 if each season is baught individually from the prices that Amazon is showing for each season. So that is a bit of a difference in price. I just thought I would share what i found since i am now going to buy them all individually since the price is such a large difference. I hope this helps someone else out too.,1314835200,91,451,4.078651685393258
4687712,5,B005G4FFBE,"I have not bought this bundle but I could not help myself to write a comment. I bought seasons 1-3 and it was a delight to watch.

4687744,5,B005G4FFBE,"Sometimes purchasing a single season of a show can be expensive, so to be able to purchase an entire series for a relatively inexpensive price is awesome.
Not all of the seasons come with the commentary and extras which is a little disappointing. Some also do not come with Closed Captioning for the Hearing Impaired which is something I use, but may not affect others. However, they do have every episode and the discs are in perfect condition. No scuffs, no skips, and no issues playing in a standard DVD player. For that, I leave a full Five star review.",1494288000,3,557,4.58

4687765,4,B005G4FFBE,Great tv show. Boxset was great! Loved having the entire series in front of me so I could take breaks between seasons. Cory and topanga's love story is beautiful! Cory and Shawn's friendship is so cute aswell. They do not make sitcoms like this for young adults anymore that actually have meaning. Hopefully girl meets world will be released on DVD even though it's Disney. Great acting and beautiful life lessons told in a meaningful way for viewers.,1485993600,,451,4.794871794871795

4687791,5,B005G4FFBE,"Great show. Fun extras on some of the later DVDs. This includes the episodes that originally were not aired due to their sexual nature, domestic violence, or teenage alcohol use (not that there is much of any of those). If you have a child watching Girl Meets World on Disney right now, get this set and you'll realize just how many references are made to BMW in GMW.",1476489600,,367,4.411764705882353

I love that I can now introduce Boy Meets World to the little ones in the family that are currently watching Girl Meets World - They'll love it!

4687799,2,B005G4FFBE,Great TV show from my childhood! Completely love the series. My only problem is the DVD are scratched when I got them to the point that they skip. Season 1 disc one skips due to scratches from what appears to be a high spot in case they come in. Season 2 disc one has the same scratches. Season 3 disc one has scratches from what appear to be a high spot in case as well.. Poor overall design on DVD storage cases. Season 5 disc one also has these same spots as well. Currently playing this disc to see if it skips like disc one.,1472947200,,529,4.0476190476190474

4687812,1,B005G4FFBE,"You get the entire series, which is really all I need. It's annoying to not have ""chapters"" in each episode for easy navigating back to what you need, and sometimes the vocal track doesn't match the video. Restarting the episode fixes the vocal, but it shouldn't need to be done at all. Cheap but worth the $30 I paid.
I have started season five and the discs keep skipping and turning my machine off. For all I know they are hurting it. Rewinding works though. Considering returning.",1469145600,,484,4.574712643678161

I will admit there isn't much in the way of bonus features but honestly I don't care much for the extras. I may look at them once and that's it. I'm content with watching the episodes alone.

As for the TV series--Boy Meets World helped me grow up, it tackles some pretty serious things and doesn't shy around it but does it in a way that was funny and encouraging when I was younger. Rewatching them now I would definitely say they are a little overly dramatic--but at the time that was fine with me! I would encourage it for anyone who wants their kids to grow up with Mr. Feeny as their guide and conscious. Love me that Feeny.",1443225600,,561,4.446601941747573

It looked like someone just took the dvds off of their shelf and threw them in the box.  As a 'complete series' I expected it to be in a nice box.  This was a gift and I was very disappointed in it's appearance.  As I said - this is at least the 3rd review I have done on this.

The story lines were better and there was more of a concerted effort to make stories. I know the cast themselves prefered the later years because they had a close relationship. Still If I had to choose I'd pick Minkus, Mr. Turner, Harley & Frankie & Joey over Angela, Rachel, and Jack. Though the later years had some moments as well the Wedding, the last episode, the squirrel one, the one where they are all fighting and the one's with Lauren.",1431302400,,575,4.333333333333333

Some of the edges were dented and when I went to opened season 7 dvd, the protective seal on the top of the dvd had been half way torn off.",1429142400,,282,3.76271186440678

4688028,4,B005G4FFBE,"This was one of my favorites shows growing up and it's great to finally see all the episodes I missed so I could see the full life of Cory Matthews. The show starts off a little slowly in season 1, but immediately gets much better in season 2. The show gets deeper the older the main characters get, as they no longer deal with the problems of 11 year olds, but the chaos of growing up, love, college, heart break and all that fun stuff. It is a very funny show and will definitely keep people of all ages entertained.
The only down side to this is their is no convenient box set. You just get all the seperate dvds for each season in a plastic bag, so it takes up a lot of room on my movie shelf",1428969600,2,696,4.014388489208633

4688039,5,B005G4FFBE,"I loved this series since I was a kid and still do.

I catch it occasionally on MTV or ABC Family when it replays episodes.

Id love to own the complete collection but the price is somewhat steep at the moment.

So Im gonna wait for this to come down more then gladly purchase it.

What I loved about this show is it really got to the heart of family friends it was just a very well written show.

While it could definitely be hilarious it could also be very touching and heartfelt.

My father died in 2011 I miss him everyday the only episode I now find it so difficult to watch is the episode where (SPOILER for anyone who hasn't seen BMW please do not keep reading) Shawns father dies in the hospital.

Mine died from Sepsis in the hospital so it just hits too close to home now for me to enjoy .",1426809600,,799,4.083333333333333

I'm in the process of watching Season 5 and so far 2 of the episodes are missing. On these episodes, the previous episodes play again under a different title. This is so aggravating, when one of the episodes is a continuation of the previous one and it can't be seen. It's too late to get a replacement, because they expect you to watch them all immediately at one time, in order to know if something is wrong with them.",1425859200,3,577,4.207207207207207

4688064,3,B005G4FFBE,"When reading the reviews that were recent on this product and looking at the user posted pictures, this was implied to be a box set. A 4 case set with all 7 seasons and a bonus disk.

It arrived today and it couldn't be more off. What i got is what is shown in the head picture. all 7 individual seasons. Which is technically what i ordered. Im not giving a 2 star because i got what i ordered, just not what i thought i was ordering.",1423612800,8,434,3.9885057471264367
4688065,2,B005G4FFBE,"I'm rating the physical product, not the content. I was given this collection as a gift (After much anticipation! It's been on my wishlist since it came out.) and the box arrived all plastic wrapped, but when I unwrapped the box and removed the four DVD cases they were all broken in the space where you grab the edges to open the case. Two of the cases have a piece that should be tucked into the opposite case flap when closed that is broken and hanging off. Two cases had holes and the broken off bits were left behind in the box. Additionally, in the first case the ""hinges"" that hold all the DVD ""pages"" so you can flip through the discs sheared off leaving the ""pages"" loose in the case upon opening. All the cases are broken in such a way that they had to have been broken prior to boxing, probably in the process of housing the discs. It's shameful to distribute a product that is damaged like this in the process of packaging.

I'll keep the product because thankfully none of the DVDs are damaged, but it's really annoying to have all these cases broken. It makes them more difficult to open and close and I'm nervous I'll slice a finger on the jagged edges left behind.",1423612800,,1180,4.363636363636363

4688165,5,B005G4FFBE,"Very happy with everything. It was shipped to me internationally and I had no problems. It came almost a week before the expected date and besides a few dints in the corners of the box, which is inevitable, everything else was great. It came in the original packaging (brand new), all cases and cover box sealed. The quality is average in the first few seasons which is not surprising as it was filmed in the early 90s but otherwise it is great. Although I did want all the seasons in seperate cases (cases = season 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 and 7), I do not regret buying the box set over the individual seasons as it has special features and probably is better as it was released only in December 2013. Boy Meets World is one of my all time favourite shows and to sum everything up, I am extremely happy with everything and now can go back and watch every episode again. 1000% recommend buying it through Amazon :))",1411430400,4,905,4.392857142857143

I had remembered liking every episode I had seen, but they were fragmented and rarely from the same season by the time I was able to watch them regularly.  Buying the whole season for forty something dollars was the best purchase i've made in awhile. I had some initial concerns about the quality of the disks, but they all played with only one or two failed starts(but they always worked after I rechecked the disks positioning).  The first season or two is great, you can tell they are trying to figure out exactly what the show is going to be about, but the heart is there, and around early or mid season three it had me very invested in each character.  If you remember liking any episodes of Boy Meets World when you were younger I recommend you buy this, because 90% of the episodes are simply great.",1403654400,3,943,4.280898876404494

I had never seen the first few episodes, so it has been fun to put all the pieces together.  Good, clean, family-type programming which is so difficult to find now.  The series does cover a wide-range of topics still relevant today, but they do it without a lot of bad language or issues parents may not want to expose to younger children.

4688260,5,B005G4FFBE,"After being tired of screening every show on TV that is appropriate for my family to watch, we cancelled our subscription to cable/directTV account altogether. Instead, I introduced my young teens to shows like ""The Wonder Years"" and now, ""Boy Meets World"".  These are shows that we can watch together that do not portray kids being spoiled rotten or adults being clueless idiots but as mature, wise, loving role models.
I recommend this series to anyone. We don't watch a ton of TV, but when we do, it's something we can enjoy together.

4688315,2,B005G4FFBE,"An amazing show that taught my husband wonderful life lessons as he grew up. I bought this for him for Christmas, it's his favorite show ever!

Was a little surprised and confused when it arrived exactly as pictured in a bag, not a box set. But I guess it should have been expected since it isn't titled as a box set. I did find a box set after purchasing at Best Buy, but it was almost $30 more than I had paid here on Amazon. It was easier for me to build a box from the one it arrived than to justify $30 for a cardboard box.

Worse than having it arrive in a bag is the condition and quality of the DVDs themselves. 2 of the discs from season 2 are scratched, one pretty severely, and there are 3 episodes that play only the beginning before freezing. And 1 disc from season 4 is lightly scratched and there's about 5 minutes in the middle of an episode that needs to be skipped in order for the DVD to not freeze up.

All in all, for $75 bucks, I would have expected much better. Very disappointed.",1389916800,2,1003,4.107142857142857

Not only is it funny, but each episode had a lesson hidden inside.

4688347,5,B005G4FFBE,"A lovely box set.  I like that for the first 3 seasons they use the Buena Vista produced DVDs that come with excellent special features including commentaries that everyone should listen to.  Seasons 4-7 are the ABC produced DVDs that do not come with special features.  There are only 2 ""New"" featurettes in this set.  The first, which is perfect and wonderful, is a look back with members of the cast talking about the show and what it meant to them then and now and I cried the entire time.  The second, is a complete waste of time, random fans selected to talk about the show, this featurette is very repetitive and could have never been filmed and I wouldn't care less.  I wish they had added more features since they bragged about the Box Set having all these new things you couldn't get anywhere else, but I'm still glad I purchased it.",1387238400,,843,4.477124183006536

I was a little too old to watch this on the first go around, and I was surprised to find that some of the subject matter was mature without being tittilating.

4688368,3,B005G4FFBE,"Lionsgate Home Entertainment has re-released the entire 7-year run of Boy Meets World in a massive 22-disc set.

==The Packaging==
The set contains four multi-disc DVD cases and the outer ""Complete Collection"" cardboard slipcase.

* The first DVD case, which hold 6 discs in a few flip-trays, contains the complete first and second seasons.  The DVD cover is the same cover used for the Complete Second Season set.  It also includes a double-sided episode list insert for all 7 seasons.

* The second DVD case, which holds 6 discs in a few flip-trays, contains the complete third and forth seasons.  The DVD cover is the same cover used for the Complete Third Season set.

* The third DVD case, which hold 6 discs in a few flip-trays, contains the complete fifth and sixth seasons.  Unlike the other 3 DVD cases which reuse previous set covers the DVD cover is a new image (circa season 5).

* The fourth and final DVD case, which holds 4 discs, contains the complete seventh season.  It also contains the exclusive brand new Bonus features disc.  The DVD cover is the same cover from the Season 7 set.

==The Content==
The content of the set is completely unchanged from the single season sets that Lionsgate released, even down to the disc art.

==The Extras==
Since the content of the set is completely unchanged from single season sets, the commentaries for Seasons 1 and 2, and the Quiz mini-game from Season 3 are still included here.

The main bonus for this set (aside from the new packaging and all-in-one set), the exclusive Bonus Features disc, is pretty lacking.  There are only 2 new features, and they combine for about 30 minutes of content.

The first bonus feature, ""Back to the Beginning"", is a cast retrospective on the series that runs about 18 minutes in length.  Most of the main cast is interviewed (Ben Savage, Rider Strong, Danielle Fishel, Will Friedle, William Daniels, Betsy Randle, Lindsey Ridgeway (the second Morgan), Trina McGee-Davis, Matthew Lawrence, and Maitland Ward).  The only main cast members that don't appear are William Russ (Alan Matthews), Lily Nicksay (Morgan 1), Anthony Quinn (Johnathan Turner), Alex Desert (Eli Williams).  It's a fun look back with the cast, but I wish it was longer and more in-depth.  It covers the entire length of the show and is nothing groundbreaking (brief thoughts on the Pilot, brief thoughts on favorite moments/episodes/character quirks (e.g. The Feeny call), brief thoughts on the series finale).

The second bonus feature, ""Boy Meets... World Fandom"" is an odd feature.  Fans of the show are interviewed and mention why they like the show, their favorite moments/characters, etc.  Thankfully it runs a mere 12 minutes.

30 minutes of bonus features on a DVD specifically containing new bonus features is a real shame, even if they only used a DVD-5/single layer DVD (4.7 GB/120 minutes).  If you're going to release a bonus features disc, pack it to the brim!  Seasons 3-7 contain some of the show's funniest and most memorable episodes, and it's too bad they couldn't have done new commentaries and included them on the bonus disc.  I would have loved to hear a commentary for the final episode at least.

==To Upgrade or not to Upgrade?==
If you don't own any of the single season sets, then this is a decent purchase.  It contains all 158 episodes of Boy Meets World, plus a short bonus disc, and takes up less shelf space than the individual season sets.  It's probably less expensive as well.

If you do own all of the single season sets, I honestly can't recommend upgrading.  The only real advantage this set has over the individual sets is it takes up less shelf space.  The exclusive bonus features disc is very thin on extras and is really disappointing.  You won't miss anything by not owning the bonus features disc.  I already planned on double-dipping for this set, so I sold my individual season sets and used the money from that sale toward the purchase of this set.",1383955200,308,3963,4.812130177514793
4688369,5,B005G4FFBE,I bought this for my sister for Christmas. We loved Boy Meets World growing up so I was excited to find the complete collection. I hope she loves it as much as I do.,1383868800,,165,3.8823529411764706
4688370,4,B005G4FFBE,"I just received this updated box set with new, unseen bonus features and, of course, I LOVE this show!  It's a classic!  What I did find, however, with my discs is that the volume has a very slight way of going a bit louder and softer at parts throughout the episodes.  I'm on the second disc of Season 2 right now and that volume change has continued for all discs thus far.  For that reason, I gave this rating of 4 stars instead of 5.  The differences is not super drastic, but is just odd and somewhat annoying (not overly, however).  As for the show itself, it's amazing and you really should purchase this set if you want all of the seasons plus some great extras.

4688387,5,B005G4FFBE,"I am 53 years old and fell in love with this show in reruns and HAD to purchase the entire series on dvd.  No matter what age you may be this show is timeless.  It is a sincere, heartfelt and hilarious comedy made with such passion and talent that its magic lives on and on.  Whatever seasons you favor the entire run of this show was a gem.  To see it from the beginning with the inspiring friendship between Cory and Shawn as they encounter school and life is not to be missed.  Mr. Feeney of course is the life lesson master here and once Topanga is fully added the entire show is like a jewel shining brightly.  Some episodes were hilarious slapstick while others touched on some very serious subject matter.  The young cast handled it all impeccably and their acting chops developed greatly over the years.  The show has finally been released in a box set but it is more expensive than this bundle of all 7 seasons.  You do miss out on a few added new cast interviews but otherwise all the extras are the same.

If you are reading this review you are a fan already.  Any one lucky enough to have been touched by this show knows it is a must own.  Topanga, Cory, Shawn, Eric, Mr. Feeney, the parents and more characters brought in all blend together to make television magic.  I truly love this show and each episode continues to warm my heart and make me laugh out loud.  And to think we have GIRL MEETS WORLD to look forward to, a new show with Cory and Topanga raising a teen daughter, is amazing.

Boy Meets World (BMW) follows the story of Corey Matthews and his friends and family from middle school to marriage. Follow our main character as he learns of life, love, loss, and friendship. This is perhaps the perfect show.

4688408,4,B005G4FFBE,"Boy Meets World is an enjoyable, fun and hilarious TV show. Seasons 1-7 are included in this bundle. My only complaint is that the bonus supplements are light. Perhaps a Blu-ray collection will be released that is loaded with over 8 hours of bonus supplements. Amazon reviewers give this release an amazing 5 star rating. Are we ever going to see Ben's brother get his own TV series (Wonder Years) on DVD or Blu-ray? This set has held its value well.",1378857600,,450,4.567901234567901

4688443,2,B005G4FFBE,"First off, I enjoy Boy Meets World very much. My wife grew up watching this show, and I'm glad that we can watch any episode whenever we want. What I don't enjoy very much is the amount of effort that went into preparing this set. There are hardly any special features at all. OK, so that's not all that bad, at least we've got the show itself, right? Well, none of the seasons has any synopses listed in any of the packaging. Do you have a particular episode that you want to watch? Well, you'll have to go to IMDB to get even a basic idea of which episode is which. At least the first three seasons have the episode titles listed on the disc. The final four seasons don't even have that basic convenience, so not only do you have to look the synopses up elsewhere, but you also have to actually put the disc into the player to see if that one has the episode that you're looking for.

All in all, I'm moderately disappointed. The item is accurately described, and the seller was very prompt, so no complaints about the purchasing aspect. Plus, the series has aged very well, and there's a lot of great TV in this set. If you want Boy Meets World, this set will give you your fix, and I'm not sure that there are any other realistic options. Without synopses or episode listings though, this set is pretty much restricted to ""play all."" It's such a shame to see such a quality series get such a poor presentation.",1376870400,4,1414,4.315789473684211

Finished watching all 7 seasons and every episode was watchable and good quality. A couple of episodes looked a bit faded in color but that's to be expected of an older TV show.

The reason for the back story is to say that I enjoyed rewatch the parts of the show I recall enjoying as a child but the rest didn't have that same campy feel. I still give this 5 stars though as the DVD's/Show provided what was described and, to be honest, I didn't expect this show to hold up well to age; in that aspect, it out did any expectation I had.",1369699200,,531,3.925925925925926

I just recently watched it and enjoyed it just as much as I did when I was a teenager. This is my favorite show of all time and I highly recommend watching. One of favorite parts of my childhood was when I started watching the show in 1993 when I was 10 and watching all the way to the end, and having the feeling that you grew up with the characters was really fun.

So I have 7 DVDs just sitting in my shelf. And I am not sure if its the quality of the show or my computer but when I play the DVDs on my computer the sound quality is not great. You can hear a difference in sound volume as you watch the show, but it is still watchable and should not stop you from buying this product (again not sure what the root of the problem).

They don't make shows like this anymore (though hopefully Girl Meets World will live up to lofty expectations) and more than worth watching with your children nowadays.

I missed watching this show and when I saw that it was only about $75 at the time and originally around $100, I needed to get it. The package came completely new too which shocked me because I thought it was going to be used. Definitely worth its price. I can't wait for the show to come back.",1362528000,,353,4.057142857142857

4688648,5,B005G4FFBE,"I loved this show as a kid so of course I took the opportunity to buy it during an Amazon Gold Box Deal of the Day.

The video quality is pretty good, similar to and/or better than when the episodes originally aired.

I can't comment on the current price. I've seen some reviews saying it would be cheaper to buy each season individually, so maybe look into that. This option is more convenient if you must have every season RIGHT NOW.

The DVDs are packaged just like the picture depicts; each separate season in its own case (3-4 maybe 5 DVDs per case, I believe) wrapped in clear plastic. There is no case to store all 7 cases together.

I haven't had a BMW in a while, but from what I can remember there were not that many special features on the DVD. That's not a con for me, as I purchased this for the show, not special features.",1361923200,2,836,4.238993710691824

4688651,5,B005G4FFBE,"Boy Meets World was at least partly responsible for teaching me life lessons during my youth.  It's refreshing to be able to watch this show again and recognize even more things that the younger me might have missed (along with some subtle adult humor that is a pleasant surprise).  Alan is truly an underrated father character in tv sitcom history: he's calm and cool, and doesn't fully unleash his anger unless A) it's truly deserved and B) Amy let's him off his leash.  George Feeney, much like Wilson from 'Home Improvement' is a spectacular teacher of both history and life.

I'm only onto season 3, but there are no problems so far with the discs themselves either.

For those of you who grew up with 'TGIF', this will be a welcome encore performance of arguably one of the greatest shows.  And yet it would still be a worthwhile purchase for those who missed out on this TV gem.",1361232000,,885,4.569620253164557

4688829,5,B005G4FFBE,"If you're reading this, you are probably already familiar with the show so I won't bother commenting on content. I ordered this set and it arrived quickly, all disks were brand new, sealed, and all 7 DVD cases were enclosed together in a clear plastic covering.

4688830,5,B005G4FFBE,this is such a great deal!!!! each season can be purchased for 20 a piece so getting ALL SEVEN for 65?!?! you cant beat it! it came right on time and packaged well. i cant wait to watch them all!!!!,1334707200,,198,3.975
4688831,5,B005G4FFBE,MY KIDS USED TO WATCH THIS SHOW WHEN THEYWERE YOUNG THEY ARE IN THEIR 20'S AND THE STILL WATCH IT ON NICK AT NIGHT NOW THEY CAN WATCH IN ALL THE TIME THEY STILL LOVE THIS SHOW AS DO I.  I WOULD TELL MY FRIENDS TO BUYS THIS.,1334707200,,223,3.6458333333333335
4688842,5,B005G4FFBE,"In my opinion, Boy Meets World is one of the greatest shows ever. Sure there have been some characteristic changes throughout the years but, even still, the comedy is always gold in each episode. Plus, no other show has Mr. Feeny! The life lessons imparted through his wise old mind have been very applicable throughout my childhood growing up into an adult. I forced my girlfriend to watch it with me and she too agrees that this is a very good show. She's from Ukraine so, it doesn't hold that you needed to have had this show as part of your childhood to enjoy!

Now do yourself a favor and buy it already!!!",1334620800,,611,4.407079646017699
4688843,5,B005G4FFBE,"I just bought it for a little over $60, new. I don't know why people are complaining about the price. There are new and like new ones for around that price. You can always get a ""like new"" version from a reputable seller, too--I've never had any problem with that. Just be sure that your seller has good ratings and comments, especially for your product, and you should be fine.

I bought the entire series altogether. I calculated it, and if I bought the cheapest/second-cheapest one for each season, the difference between the two would be very little--as in under $5. I don't know, maybe they cut the price, but I got it for a very good deal.

One thing that I love about this show is how much you learn from it. I also love how you get to see the characters grow up over seven seasons, and you grow with them (or at least I did, as I was a kid back then). Even today, in my 20s, I still feel like I learn from re-watching this show and of course I love revisiting my favorite episodes. It's a show that stands the test of time and isn't ""dated"". My favorite characters are Eric and Mr. Feeny; it's such a joy to watch them. I'm glad that I got to grow up in the 1990s, and I feel that shows like this reflect the spirit of the times. The show does a good job of having its serious moments without being too sappy or over-the-top, and it does a great job with the comedy. This show is entertaining and wins you over without resorting to cheap tricks (such as gratuitous sex, trying to be ""edgy"", gratuitous violence, or other forms of shark-jumping, over-the-top ""drama""). I really enjoy that. This show doesn't need stuff like that to get people to watch it--""Boy Meets World"" is great without those unnecessary gimmicks. A great childhood memory.",1333497600,,1751,4.384615384615385
4688844,4,B005G4FFBE,The DVD's don't work in Australia due to the regions :( But I will be working to find a way around that. Came in good packaging and was in good condition.,1333497600,,154,4.0

4688846,4,B005G4FFBE,"First off, my wife and I grew up on this show. Its a decent one, with things not too heavy handed morally, and some decent comedy in between. The only thing preventing this from being a 5 star is the dvds coming just separately. From the description as I bought it, I was expecting more of a box set instead of jsut loose dvds.",1332201600,,327,4.125
4688847,4,B005G4FFBE,"I love that I am now able to experience EVERY episode of BmW. Dvds arrived on time and were packaged safely. My only complaint (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that so far 2 of the episodes have (up to the middle of season 3 so far) not been able to properly play. It appears so though the disc might have been scratched/damaged prior to my receiving it. It is a little disappointing as one of the ""unplayables""  is my fav episode. Still with that said, I would still probably make this purchase.",1330819200,,508,4.237113402061856
4688848,5,B005G4FFBE,"I was worried a few years ago that this series would get the shaft and not get a full release on DVD like what has happened to so many series. Well season seven finally released last year, so I patiently waited for a complete series set, and then I was sent an email from Amazon about their 1 day sale of Boy Meets World the complete series for $60! I couldn't his add to cart fast enough!

I loved this series when I was a kid, and it holds up surprisingly well in my adulthood. Mostly due to the fact that I am a daddy now. As a kid I loved that it was from the kid's point of view. As an adult I can laugh at more of the mature-ish jokes, that were just above my head as a kid. Don't get me wrong, it's still a very family friendly show, just not a squeaky clean as say Full House.

A great series to share with the family. It's cool to watch these kids grow from middle school age, to high school, then college age, and finally adulthood.",1330732800,,942,3.9788359788359786

4688851,5,B005G4FFBE,Great! fast delivery and all brand new dvd's. You may say that this is not a price deal but who cares i love boy meets world.,1329955200,,125,3.8461538461538463
4688872,5,B005G4FFBE,I enjoyed watching Boy Meets World from beginning to end when it first aired on ABC. Topanga Lawrence was a tried and true crush. I identified with both Cory's over emo take on everything and also Eric's kookiness...I also enjoyed reliving the surprise appearances from Frankie's Dad the man they call Vader. They were some of my favorite episodes. The dvd set is must have for all fans. The only thing that was upsetting about delivery is the fact that the plastic protective covering was so tight on the dvd cases that when I opened season 4 (the one with the yellow cover) the adhesive ripped the cover off the case when it came off...,1329955200,,638,4.556521739130435
4688873,5,B005G4FFBE,"Boy Meets World (BMW) first aired in the early ninties, and it stayed on the air about 10 years. Boy Meets world first appealed to elementary school children and tweens, but as the show stayed on the air, the writers very wisely changed the characters to be age appropriate. Issues talked about in the first few seasons were honestly, friendship and loyalty. As the Cory, Shawn and Topanga grew up, so did their problems. In Middle School and Highschool issues with Cults, God, abuse and Death became very real. The dilemas in college were more intense yet. Focusing on issues like adoption, Co-ed living, Sex, Alcohol, marriage and true love.

The creators kept the show fresh by shedding some early characters: Minkus, Mr. Turner and added ""Fresh Meat"" with Jack, Angela, and Rachel. Although, through it all, Mr. Feeny remains the wise Grandfatherly figure to Cory, Shawn and Topanga, and Mr. Matthews (Cory's Dad) is seen a Hardworking, Devoted Father to his wife and family and all of Cory's friends.

I'm 28 years old now, and looking back, I'm glad I watched this show instead of others that were on TV at the time. Boy Meets World wasn't afraid to discuss difficult subject matters and this gave it a 'real' feeling to it. In short it is not the cookie-cutter pop shows that Disney spews out to kids nowadays. This show grew up with it's viewers and rewarded it's fans with simple lessons to help them along their way.

Favorite Episodes include ""Cult Fiction"", ""Things Change"" and ""It's About Time"".

""Class Dismissed""

------UPDATE-------
I still love the show/dvds but I thought it may also help to speak of the quality of the dvds and packaging itself. Each Dvd was in a standard basic dvd case. Not a lot of extras, inserts, etc. the menu is basic with few features. The menus are basic and intuitive. It is also important to note that Lionsgate purchased the rights to Boy Meets World, which is why originally only a few seasons were released. Then later, after Lionsgate purchased the rights, the entire series was released, including the previously released seasons from the original company. I have been very pleased with all of the Lionsgate series I have purchased. Still a great show, and it is my hope that Girl Meets World does not stray from the genuine feel of BMW.",1329696000,172,2289,4.755667506297229
4688874,5,B005G4FFBE,"Great product.  Shipped quickly.  Good quality.  I bought this as a Valentine's gift for my wife.  She loved it.  It was nice buying it all in one group rather than piecing it together.  I have Prime, so I'm not sure if that brought the price down or if the ""list price"" looked extremely high to make you think that you were getting a good deal, but it averaged out to ~$7.5 ish per season.  Not bad!",1329696000,,400,4.184210526315789
4688875,5,B005G4FFBE,This is such an amazing series! I am so thankful that Amazon made this collection so affordable (purchased Feb 2012 for $65)! I do wish it was released on blu ray though. That could be why they are doing the deal. Thankfully this isn't a show that needs to be in blu ray. :-),1329696000,2,275,4.111111111111111
4688876,5,B005G4FFBE,Recieved this bundle today. They got here very quickly and I've already watched a few episodes. I love Boy Meets World!! I grew up with the cast and fell in love with each one of them. There are so many hilariously funny moments and watching Cory and Topanga fall in love over the years and then get married is so sweet. I'm very happy with this purchase (and the drop in price) and I look forward to watching each episode over and over. :),1329177600,,440,4.25
4688877,5,B005G4FFBE,$90.99 for the entire series of BmW?! It was a bargin in my opinion and I am so happy to have it. Shipped fast and product was new and as advertised. VERY happy. :),1327536000,,164,3.8529411764705883
4688878,5,B005G4FFBE,The only reason to buy this collection is to watch this wonderful show.  Not very many special features (if any) and the price is high for such a easy transfer to DVD.  I rate the bundle at 5 Stars because Boy Meets World is my favorite show.,1326931200,,242,4.127659574468085
4688879,5,B005G4FFBE,This show is just like I remembered it. I was a little disapointed that Topanga wasn't in the pilot but que sere sere. There were a lot a good episodes over seven seasons such as when Cory and Topanga got married in the final season and when Topanga spent christmas with Cory. I also like the prom episode where Cory and Topanga consider having sex. Another one is where Cory follows Topanga to Disneyworld to get Topanga back using Erics advice. But this show isn't just about those two. Its about a lot of kids going through school and their frustrated teacher watching them go though the stuff they do. Those are some of my eavorites episodes partly because those are my two favorite charors. This is an excellent show.,1326931200,,722,4.561538461538461
4688880,5,B005G4FFBE,I did pay more than if I would have bought them seperately unless I had to pay shipping on each one.
