7846389,5,6303441416,I used to watch this show when I was a young child. Now adays cartoons have worse graphics. I think that a company should release this series on DVD.,1317945600,,149,4.172413793103448

7846391,2,6303441416,"I like the Street Sharks. Honestly, I do. Disregard the number of stars above and know that I think they're cooler than the Ninja Turtles. Even though I only had minimal exposure to them in my youth, my rediscovery of the 80s/90s cartoon medium resulted in them being one of my favorite animals-as-superheroes team, and any memorabilia of theirs I find is quickly scooped up.
So why only two stars?

The story of the series begins as such: four teenaged brothers are subjected to a ""gene slamming"" experiment by the evil Dr. Paradigm that combines their DNA with that of four different species of shark. Transformed into anthromorphic, super-powered ""Street Sharks"", Ripster, Streex, Jab, and Slammu realize their duty to protect their native Fission City from further nefarious schemes of Paradigm and his other, nastier creations.

Needless to say, the story is old-hat, and one of the more blatant of Ninja Turtles rip-offs. I'm sorry to say that it doesn't really get any better as the series goes on, either: villains were few within the two seasons that the show ran, which meant that the Sharks almost exclusively fought Paradigm, with the same basic outline that included a plot to subject the city's population to gene slamming. The sheer unoriginality of these 26 episodes really makes you wonder what veteran cartoon writers Robert Askin (""The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"") and Phil Harnage (""Captain Planet"") had done with their imagination throughout the duration of the show.

While the creative aspect of the series is a flop, I'm afraid the animation is in even worse condition. Part of the reason that I enjoy the Street Sharks is because of the character designs, but beyond that, it's a disaster: I know that Saturday morning TV shows are not afforded the same budget or production values as a feature film, but in the case of Street Sharks, lazy and unprofessional shortcuts like insufficient, choppy frame rates are commonplace. In addition, several depictions or poses look quite wonky, and the animators seem really uncomfortable doing face-forward or running shots of the Sharks. Younger viewers might be quicker to forgive this, but for anybody else who's watched a Disney movie (or even ""The Adventures of T-Rex""), this is a nasty thorn in the eye.

For entertainment purposes, the Sharks are a pretty amusing foursome to watch, and are likable enough to still hold a number of cult fans today. Liking them is a matter of personal selection: much like choosing a favorite sports team, you select the Sharks from the many superhero teams whose adventures are no longer being broadcasted today and cherish their VHS tapes and action figures. While there are plenty of reasons to not like the Street Sharks, you need no reason at all to like them: whether a guilty pleasure or not, the Sharks prove to me that it's possible to be impossibly in love with a franchise...even when it's the silliest nonsense you can think of.",1215820800,2,2950,4.941532258064516
7846392,5,6303441416,"Yeah, always did like the Street Sharks. Ever since I was 5 years old. They aren't on anymore, which is a darn shame, but I could, if given time, always buy one of these videos. I saw this one when I was a kid, & it ROCKED! It's all about four brothers who are turned into mutant sharks, who have both the heroicness to fight crime and an endless appetite. Seems evil Dr. Piranoid(my # 1 favorite villain of the Street Sharks)& his vile seaviates(Slash, a marlin and Slobster, a lobster, # 2 and 3, both very cool)want to not only take over the city and have people as their slaves, they want to turn the sharks into mindless machines of destruction. They won't succeed. Not without a BIG fight. The sharks, who want revenge on Piranoid for how he mutated them and how before that, he ruined their dad(in a way I  would rather not tell at the moment)fight Dr. P and his two evil seaviate slaves. It happens a lot, believe me, and there are a lot of quotes which are both cool and funny. Or one or the other.  Throughout the video, which consists of 3 or 4 whole episodes of this terrific franchise, as a matter of fact. Finally, the last good thing to say about this video is that it gives Streex a lot of credit. I like that, because Streex is most definately my # 1 favorite shark! The others are cool, and do good here, but the Streexter is the top. Anyway, from loving these guys to just now saying: ""Yeah, I like them. The Street Sharks are cool."" it all evens out into 5 stars of gold and I recommend this video to any & all who like crime fighter or animal shows. I mean, it's so cool, I can remember how it went when I saw it at the age of 11! I say move over, TMNT, here come your betters!",1131840000,,1698,4.142424242424243
7846393,5,6303441416,"This is a very cool video!  In this video, four brothers get their genes spliced with Shark DNA by a mad scientist named Dr. Paradigm who's been combining sea animal and human DNA.  First he gave a lobster and swordfish human characteristics, now he's mutating humans.  After they mutate, Dr. Paradigm expects the boys to be under his control, but since they started out as humans, they still have their free will.  Paradigm attempted to add Pirahna DNA to the Street Sharks, but an accident occurred and he got it injected into himself instead.  Now, whenever Paradigm gets mad, he mutates into a pirahna mutant.  However, he only mutates when he's mad because the Pirahna DNA wasn't designed to completely mutate the host, like the Shark DNA that was added to the Street Sharks was.  Now the Street Sharks(as they now call themselves)use their new bodies and powers to stop Dr. Paradigm from mutating anymore innocent people.  However, they don't always succeed.  Luckily, most of the people that Paradigm mutates decide to help the Street Sharks stop Paradigm.  This video was based on a line of Street Sharks toys.",993427200,4,1118,4.867724867724868
