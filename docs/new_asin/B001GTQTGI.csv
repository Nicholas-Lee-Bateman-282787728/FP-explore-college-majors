8307051,4,B001GTQTGI,"I just have a complaint about the sound of the cds included with the DVD.Not as good as it should be. On the other hand,regarding the show,this is one of the fews concerts of Smooth Jazz that I saw on video that meet my expectations along with ""Live From the Marquee Club"".Great band,great music,a listening plessure for all the people who love this music genre. I LOVE JAZZ.",1439337600,,375,4.529411764705882

8307053,2,B001GTQTGI,I purchased this DVD and come to find out that it would not work in my DVD player. I returned the item and I have not heard from the shipper as of yet. I hope that they would either replace it or refund my money.,1393200000,,212,3.7333333333333334
8307054,5,B001GTQTGI,"Audio and video quality it's simply PERFECT. Sound in DD and DTS 5.1 and anamorphic panoramic video on 16/9. The concert it's brilliant, more than 2 hours + extra material.

8307055,4,B001GTQTGI,"I've been a fan of Mezzoforte since I heard ""Playing for Time"" the first time. All their hits, played live. Fantastic sounds and impressive musicianship. What about a drummer doing a bass solo!?",1359936000,,194,4.909090909090909
8307056,5,B001GTQTGI,"This is a master class in funk - from an Icelandic band.  The gig is in a fairly small concert hall with no special effect, lasers or fireworks etc.  The fireworks are entirely in the playing. The bass player, Johan Asmundsson, and the drummer, Gulli Breim, are phenomenal.  This is the tightest band currently playing - check out the ending to ""E.G"" Blues for precision ensemble playing.",1355875200,2,388,4.7611940298507465
8307057,5,B001GTQTGI,"herd of this group a few years back,and thought they were great,while on the web got some updated songs and I must say this group is just unbeleivable. What a great sound they have,jazz, soul, funk,all put together as only they can do it,just a great band. With all that in mind I saw a live concert they did a few years back,and it was available on Amazon. I ordered it and was so happy to get this wonderful band in concert,the only thing was it would not play in the u s for some reason. I had called ahead of time to verify if it would play and they said it should work. Take it form me I do buy a lot of dvd concert material,and if it is not region 1 it just won't work. I have a 3 year old sony system,that is really great but it would not play,the cds were fine but not the dvd,it was a region 0,which they said would play anywhere. Amzon retuned my money with no problems. I just don't understand why they don't produce dvds like this for region 1 play. I have bought other dvds from the UK and they were region 1 play. It is just to bad they don't correct this ,there sales in the USA can go way up if they get there act together. Will have to wait and scout around for a copy of some kind in the future. Untill then,I will enjoy there music on the web.",1317081600,,1262,3.97244094488189
8307058,1,B001GTQTGI,Cannot play the dvd here in the U.S. The cd music can be played and sounds great... but not being able to watch the video is a real bummer.,1293062400,,139,3.8275862068965516
8307059,5,B001GTQTGI,"Finally, kind of a dream come true being able to watch the amazing group Mezzoforte on DVD! I cannot overstate the fact that these musicians are among the best on the planet, the group are so professional and balanced.
Being a so called musician myself for 30 yrs, these guys are jaw droppers!

Seems to me they've got the good part of the best of the best, the DVD has 19 songs and some bonus stuff ""mezzoforte timeline"" - ""rehersals in Reykjavik""  and it's a brilliant display of JAZZ/BLUES/FUNK at it's best, the bass player (J.Asmundsson) makes it impossible to sit still, and along with the rythmic section and the funky organ/synth/piano (E.Gunnarsson) you just have to stomp and follow the groove. They also have a wonderful way of creating soft / mystic / melodious songs that are really touching and passionate.

Having said that, I certainly don't mean to take anything away from any of the other musicians. Worldclass!! Knowing how good it really is, I would have paid $50 without even blink for it.

Ok so I like it. Let me say what you shouldn't expect, do not expect a grand show stage setup, with lights, special effects, and outrageous stage clothes. Sure it is live, but not in a rock concert type of way. Wich btw suits me fine cause I'm really interested to see as much of the musicians and gears as I possibly can.

What you will see however is brilliant musicians having alots of fun, with smiling faces ripping of solos that'll make your hair at the back of your neck stand straight up, and the chin will drop into the floor again and again.

Just to clarify, I'm not in any way endorsed / related or anything else to anybody in Mezzoforte. *lol* neither am I getting paid for this review *lol*

Just love it!  Grab one ... you won't regret it",1237680000,5,1765,4.5109717868338555
