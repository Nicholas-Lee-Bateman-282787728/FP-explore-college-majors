8653800,3,B00JSZETSW,"LISTING INFORMATION INCORRECT !
The Turkish release of Catherine Breillat Filmleri contains DVD transfers of the listed 6 films with FRENCH AUDIO (original language) and TURKISH AUDIO (dubbed) and subtitles in TURKISH ONLY !

You must be able to understand spoken French (no French subtitles available) in order to enjoy these films. Or if you can read/understand Turkish.

This is a moderate value. The transfers are respectable in terms of video (bitrates around 6Mbps, all on single-layer DVDs), but not pristine (unrestored, from mildly damaged prints). The audio is somewhat shaky (short complete fadeouts in Une Vraie Jeune Fille, for instance). There has been editing (censorsip) of some titles (Sex Is Comedy, for instance).

There is no other way to get DVDs of these films for this price, however, if you want all or most of the films in this set.

One other note: the DVDs are of poor quality, physically speaking. They appear to be manufactured, but with substandard materials. There is a wide variation in quality from DVD to DVD within the set. There are physical defects in the media (""laser rot"") and the plastic is extremely easily damaged. You will likely see moderate to severe damage to the surfaces of a few of your discs in this edition, but all of the DVDs in this set played for me.",1451865600,5,1306,4.86936936936937
