8763866,5,B01GWC34N4,"While a bit dated as of 2017, this excellent movie has a great cast and a solid plot.  This 1980 film and 1982's ""An Officer & A Gentleman"" put actor Richard Gere on Hollywood's A List.  If you enjoy a good romantic mystery and/or are a fan of Mr. Gere, then I highly recommend this movie for your home collection!",1506124800,,314,4.216666666666667
