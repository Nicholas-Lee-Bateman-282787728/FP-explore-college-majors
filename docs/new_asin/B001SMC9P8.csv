8339990,1,B001SMC9P8,"I am Italian and while I like the concept, the voiceover is clearly made by somebody who has never learned the language well. I don't want my kid to be confused because in the family we pronounce the same words correctly. The stress and accent and the vowels are all a little funky. I guess if you want your kid to speak the equivalent of an obscure ancient dialect you will be fine.",1455408000,,383,4.260273972602739
8339991,4,B001SMC9P8,"For this review I chose the Japanese DVD from Little Pim.  My best friend and her family moved to Japan a couple of years ago with her husband's job.  Since that time she and her family have been learning some of the Japanese language, and when they return to the United States on visits, her children try to teach my kids some Japanese words.  I thought this would be a fun way for my kids to learn some basic Japanese to surprise their friends.

The DVD is cute, and the panda is adorable.  BUT, since it is complete immersion, there is no English translation.  There are quite a few ""words"" and ""phrases"" that are said but are difficult to figure out what they mean.  Although my youngest daughter loves watching the DVD, she has not really picked up any of the words, and has a hard time figuring out what some of the words mean on the video.  Even when I sit and watch, I have trouble figuring out some of it - then when a phrase is stated after the ""word"" there is no way to understand what the ""phrase"" means.

Thankfully there is Optional Subtitles for Parents - it definitely helps when explaining some of the Japanese words to my kids.  And my older daughter who is 8 has sat down with her little sister now to watch and has started taking notes - with the subtitles she is able to write both the English and Japanese words down so she can practice saying them.  She wants to surprise her friend when she sees her again this Summer!  She loves this DVD but wishes we had more so she could learn more conversational language instead of just color and shape words.

I think this would be great for very young children of bilingual families,and for English speaking families wanting to learn a second language - I think it is better with the subtitle option.  But of course, this is MY opinion.  I think I personally would have done better if I  had chosen Spanish instead of Japanese as I took Spanish classes in High School and still remember a bit.  But I'm just guessing - lol

If you want to have your child learn a second language, and are willing to start them young - then Little Pim does have great quality products to assist with that.

8339992,4,B001SMC9P8,"It is almost too basic, and seems like it was not well produced. However that aside, and the more important part, the kids love it and it is helping them learn some basic Hebrew.",1374192000,,178,4.264705882352941
8339993,5,B001SMC9P8,I live in Japan and was looking for a fun way for my 3yo to learn Japanese. We checked these videos out from the library before purchasing and these are great! My daughter watches them every day and is now speaking all of the words on the video. I would highly recommend these videos to anyone wanting a fun way for their kids to study Japanese. Fun and educational. Can't beat this!,1357776000,,383,4.333333333333333
8339994,3,B001SMC9P8,"I wanted to help teach and expose my two young children (2 and 3 years old) to Japanese since I speak it but my spouse does not.  I loved the idea of this DVD series covering topics only related to young children (as opposed to playing a second language learning DVD geared towards adults).  However, I expected the DVD to show Japanese children speaking Japanese or at least have a Japanese setting, but the video clips only showed American children with romanized subtitles displayed on each clip.  I was disappointed that their method of language learning was disassociated with culture, and that they didn't use the Japanese hiragana characters when spelling the words/phrases.  Although children can still pick up words and their meanings through watching the DVD, I was disappointed at how it didn't feel ""Japanese"" at all.",1357516800,,829,4.9855072463768115
8339995,1,B001SMC9P8,My granddaughters love educational dvds and are enjoying learning Hebrew.  They did not enjoy these videos and have barely looked at them.  I feel as if it was a waste of money. The animation and the relativity of the video is awful.,1316131200,,233,4.523809523809524
