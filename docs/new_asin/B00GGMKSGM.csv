6075236,3,B00GGMKSGM,Season 4 contains four wonderful episodes that conclude this unique adult comedy.  Season 4's storyline is better constructed compared to season 3.  The fourth season is tastefully composed but still falls short of what the first 2 seasons delivered.  Make sure you have tissues handy.  Season 4 is a unexpected tearjerker.  I would of gave 5 stars if the finale had the same drama essence of Cathy's chemo-therapy friend in passing via season 2.  I was expecting a big funeral for Cathy with all her friends at the end but it didn't happen.,1387584000,4,541,4.763440860215054
6075237,5,B00GGMKSGM,"I first started to watch this series because of Laura Linney. She is one of the most under-rated actresses on this planet. At first, I was not sure that I would continue to watch, but became very involved at the end of the first season. Season two reeled me in more. This was an incredible series about a woman who had stage 4 skin cancer. Then season 3 happened. I don't know what the writers were thinking...the series went in a bizarre direction. I almost stopped watching it. Then, when I heard season 4 would be the last, I knew that I had to see how it would play out. Boy, am I glad I did! Season 4 was the most compelling, moving season of any series that I had ever seen. Cathy (Linney) was seen in the final year of her life, with her family close by. It made my heart break. There are only four episodes but I cried during every one of them. For those who watched the other 3 seasons, I recommend this season because it is far superior to the other three seasons. For those who haven't seen this series, I can only say that season 4 is strong enough to stand on its own without not seeing the other seasons. It has enough content to be a mini-series. I will conclude with congratulations on Laura Linney's Emmy win for this fantastic season. WHAT A JOURNEY!",1387238400,34,1268,4.265560165975104

6075242,3,B00GGMKSGM,"Although I watched every season of this series, I never really liked the Cathy character. I don't know if it was the writing or the acting or what. But she got on my nerves a lot. The character of Adam also never became a particularly likable character for me, he became a kind of silly man rather than a man struggling with a mental illness.

6075256,5,B00GGMKSGM,"Finally a more realistic depiction of what a cancer battle can be like. (unlike Breaking Bad- which was a good show-but totally unrealistic- who battles the Cartel while going through chemo?? You'd be lucky to get out of bed!) Ok, so this a comedy with some fun far out storylines which make it fun. And Laura Linney is awesome as always. But as a survivor of cancer, I found it a relief that some realities and some of the real emotional stuff were mixed in. I cried and laughed and got inspired by this series. Reminded me of my own personal journey, the scarey stuff, the emotional stuff, and the valuable stuff that came from it- and that family is everything.",1450483200,,664,4.4958677685950414

6075258,5,B00GGMKSGM,"At first, it may seem that the end is a bit anti-climactic. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but it's not as dramatic as you might think, especially in the last episode. What I came to love about it though was that they didn't sugarcoat it. Knowing someone who left this earth in a very similar way - short but necessary chemo, when/if to stop it, when to decide on hospice, at home or not at home - the final season was so incredibly true to life. And in writing in this way, they made me put off wanting to watch the last season and the last episode for a good 2 years because I felt as if I was saying goodbye to an actual person, someone I actually knew. It was more than the finale of a show; it felt like the death of a good friend.

And yet, knowing what the four seasons were building up to, the combination of outstanding cast and writing still made me laugh out loud and cry with tears streaming down my face all in the same episodes. They were able to pull that off in each of the seasons, laugh and cry at the same time, and the final season was no different.",1445558400,,1078,4.061032863849765

I will rewatch these, because I think they capture a certain something so essential to the experience.

6075302,5,B00GGMKSGM,"BIG C REVIEW

Maybe I'm just a die-hard Laura Linney fan, but I've loved every minute of this 4-season series. It takes superior creativity, writing and acting to make dying from cancer consistently funny and poignant at the same time.

I was certain -- or maybe just hoped -- that Season 3 was the series finale, with Linney's character sailing off in the sunset with a dark, curly-haired stranger after he rescues her from drowning. With her family still ashore, I figured she'd just disappeared from their lives and we could side-step the heartache of a prolonged, chemo-ravaged demise for the protagonist we'd grown to love. (Emma Thompson's gut-wrenching performance in ""Wit""  illustrates the inherent value of this option for the faint of heart). No need for another season, I surmised.

Well, I was wrong. Here is Season 4, the series finale, and we are not spared its sorrow. Yet, the storyline is so peppered with acts of love (minus the mush), spiced with laughter and hope, and its loose ends eventually trussed in an uncontrived way, that the mixture is highly palatable, if not downright tasty.

With her usual finesse, Laura Linney portrays Cathy, a high school history teacher who has been battling Stage 4 melanoma for three years. Linney illuminates the nuances of the fear, anger, grief and acceptance that go with the journey. In addition to Cathy's medical and emotional issues (even her oncologist, she discovers, has cancer), she copes with marital problems, raising a teen-aged son whom she hopes to live to see graduate from high school, and opens her home and heart to one of her former students. In between, she manages to indulge deeply in impulses, find joy in the small stuff, and interact hilariously with her environmentally-obsessed brother.

The supporting cast (Oliver Platt as husband Paul, Gabriel Basso as son Adam, Gabourey  Sidibe as her student Andrea, and John Benjamin Hickey as brother Sean) provide great characters for Linney to play off of, each actor bringing considerable depth and range to their respective roles. Kathy Najimy, Brian Dennehy and Phyllis Somerville have arcs within the season as well, playing Cathy's therapist, father and deceased neighbor, respectively.

Most importantly, The Big C  can serve as a guide for understanding and coping with the human realities and consequences of terminal illness. Cathy's relentless resilience -- to the very end -- and her ability to find humor and courage in the face of declining health, are what make this series inspiring, as well as entertaining. I highly recommend The Big C.

6075303,5,B00GGMKSGM,"Several poignant stunning moments in these four deeply moving episodes.

6075319,4,B00GGMKSGM,"These episodes were an okay way to end the series.  I started watching the show because I also have a cancer diagnosis.  Despite a number of things I didn't like about The Big C, I still found it entertaining. In the final episodes, Cathy's life seems to come full circle. The reality of her situation finally seems to hit her and she can't try to run away from it the way she has before. If you've watched the series up till now, you will find parts of these last four shows somewhat predicable and some things may catch you by surprise.  This show is beautifully filmed.

A few things about season 4 didn't quite click for me. For instance, Cathy's hair is always greasy looking, but her clothes are immaculately ironed.  The son who's supposed to be 16 looks much older so it was a stretch to really think he was a kid in high school. Some new characters were briefly introduced but most seemed to clutter up the storyline.  However, Kathy Najimy has a guest appearance throughout this season and I very much liked her character.

6075328,5,B00GGMKSGM,What a fantastic show.  Watch this final season and you will never question why Laura Linney won the Emmy for her Season 4 portrayal.,1407024000,,133,4.541666666666667
6075329,3,B00GGMKSGM,"Hope this is the end, very tired of all the phony troubles as we're sure we all know many families going thru ""real problems"" involved with cancer patients.  Enough already!",1406851200,,173,4.766666666666667

6075333,5,B00GGMKSGM,"This final season of four one hour long episodes is about as good as Tv can get, right up there with the best of ""Breaking Bad"" and thats saying something. Dealing so directly with someone dying of cancer, it could have been maudlin and drawn out, but it plays its story with such warmth, truth and good humour that it leaves one a little gobsmacked. Laura Linney is beyond brilliant and her performance in the final scenes is about the first time for many years that a drama has made me cry, sheerly out of wonder and respect for her performance...A rich gift....the whole series is wonderful and this is the perfect climax.",1406160000,,625,4.539823008849558
6075334,5,B00GGMKSGM,"This was a super show. This being the finale season of the show made me sad too see it end. The 4th season was a very heart warming, powerful, sad, & joyful ending of the show. This season made you really see & feel what happens to love ones with cancer. Great acting.",1405987200,,268,4.0754716981132075
6075335,5,B00GGMKSGM,"I loved the season and the whole show, but I paid $16.99 for 4 episodes in SD, which is ridiculous. I thought there would be more episodes in the ""Finale"". I feel like I got totally ripped off. I would have just paid  the $1.99 per episode and saved $9.00.
So if you are a fan of ""The Big C"" just pay for each episode, and if you only have a 32"" or smallish screen HDTV just go for the SD transmission, it doesn't make that much difference on shows like this.
Sorry to be a griper, but I'm on SSD, and make less than 15K a year. I can't afford to squander my money. I do, however recommend ""Amazon Prime"". For $100 per year you get hundreds of movies and top TV series for free. Plus you get a lot of items on Amazon for 20% off, and free 2- day shipping. It's well worth the $100, especially if you like to shop online. You can also get some outstanding prices on 'Items of the day'. One day I saw a laptop computer for $59! But you
Must be a prime member. I'm pretty sure I've already gotten my money back. Also, if you buy the ""Kindle Fire"" smart phone you get one year of Amazon Prime. That's a great deal!!!",1405641600,2,1112,4.009009009009009
6075336,5,B00GGMKSGM,Such  a fantastic season to end on.  All actors were superb as were the episodes.,1405382400,,81,4.333333333333333

6075338,5,B00GGMKSGM,"By the title you know what is to come, so it was hard to watch, but stayed glued til the end. Such a strong character Laura Linney played so well, you have to love her and all she stood for. This show brings out many more emotions than just sadness.",1404864000,4,249,4.0
6075339,5,B00GGMKSGM,"The Big C: Hereafter is the ending of a sometimes great and sometimes mediocre series, which was always elevated by the incredible Laura Linney. For the fourth and final season, the show switches from a half hour comedy to a one-hour drama (though it does keep some comedic moments, just as the 'comedy' episodes had many dramatic moments as well). The writing is great, the acting superb, and the story leaves you breathless. The final four episodes of The Big C make the entire journey worthwile.",1404259200,,498,4.8023255813953485
6075340,5,B00GGMKSGM,"Loved all 4 seasons. Very sensitive, with a comedy side.  Cathy, the main character, is believable and her outlook on her diagnosis is amazing.  Definitely worth investing in all 4 seasons",1401148800,,188,5.032258064516129
6075341,5,B00GGMKSGM,Love the show! Laura Linney is fabulous and really draws you into the storyline.  Especially loved the show where she bought Adam the car and all the gifts she was going to miss out on in the future.  TORE ME UP!,1401148800,,212,4.146341463414634
6075342,5,B00GGMKSGM,"After a so-so season three The Big C wraps up somewhat closer to its roots.  As always, Laura Linney is a joy to watch.",1400630400,,119,3.9583333333333335
6075343,5,B00GGMKSGM,The Big C was the most insane rollercoaster of laughs and tears I have ever experienced. It is deeply touching but at the same time hysterically funny. They have a great balance but that series finale was the best way to end it all. Thanks for the ride!!,1399334400,,254,4.3125
6075344,4,B00GGMKSGM,"There is no way that this could be as great as the other three because the producers cut it down to very few episodes just to end the series. I suppose if they weren't counting on DVD and streaming sales we wouldn't have even gotten that.  This is similar with what happened to ENLIGHTENED on HBO. Given that everyone was thus forced to work on just wrapping it up, they still did a pretty remarkable job.

POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD

Essentially, the wrap up is Cathy's actual death from stage four skin cancer. That is why you see the raven on top of her head on the box. There are no new guest stars like Hugh Dancy or Susan Sarandon, as in prior seasons, because there isn't time. Kathy tries hospice care at a facility but then comes back home for in home hospice. All of her relatives have to go through their own crises in letting her go. There is a fashion show presided over by Isaac Mizrahi, the designer, and Cathy is one of the models.  There is a lot of good stuff here. So I'm grateful they finished it and didn't leave us hanging as has been done in the past.  With these cautions, by all means watch season four. Laura Linney as Cathy is of course fantastic throughout.
