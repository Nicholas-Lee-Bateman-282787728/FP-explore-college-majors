940892,4,6304938748,"""Krippendorf's Tribe"" isn't Richard Dreyfuss's best movie to date, especially having released the stunning ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" two years previous.  Some of his lines were overreacted. Besides this, there are good elements in the movie.  Some funny scenes will catch the audience's eyes.  However, the borderline between fantasy and reality needed to be recognized by the producers.  Despite, faking eyecatching ""Shelmikedmu"" rituals to gain national recognition is clever.  Such scenes lead the audience to a surprising conclusion.  Lily Tomlin plays the funny role that viewers either love or hate.  Some of Jenna Elfman's lines were underreacted, but when she shines, she shines bright.  Notice rising star Gregory Smith, the middle child.  He's performed better, but his role was still underrated.
Fans of certain actors in this movie should rent ""Krippendorf's Tribe"" once.  Some mixed opinions about the outcome will arise, but everyone will be entertained.",1061596800,3,963,5.5793103448275865
940893,1,6304938748,"The premise of this movie, involving a hairbrained anthropology professor, a lusty grad student, some misappropriated grant funds and a completely invented tribe of New Guineans, is clever.  Unfortunately, this movie (pardon what I'm about to say) chews up a good idea and regurgitates it onto the screen.  The plot and directing is completely implausible from start to finish.  The depiction of native New Guinean tribes is utterly fake, silly and Hollywoodized and, frankly, treats native peoples in an offensively stupid manner.  The contrived comedic situations are almost never funny.  I chuckled once or twice, but most of the time stared in disbelief at the poor taste and childishness of it all.  This in spite of the fact that it has two very skilled actors.  Which proves a timeless truth -- actors and their agents are almost always terrible judges of both scripts and directing.  Unless you suffer from the same flaw, you will not enjoy this movie.",1057017600,3,960,5.031645569620253
940894,3,6304938748,"This is a great DVD movie for all, but especially anthropologists and other university types as it shows Dreyfuss' characther doing what he can to keep his grants and his prestigious job. It is indeed ""hysterically funny"" and ""wildly hilarious"" as the covers say and despite its lack of extras is a fine disc so rush out and buy it and...
Wait, there's one little problem...WHERE'S THE WIDESCREEN?  The back specs say Widescreen, so why is it FullScreen? Granted, the 'home movie' film clips would be difficult to render Wide, but still, why say it is when it is not. Very disappointing, which is why I give it only 3 stars and suggest being careful if that is what you want, otherwise, enjoy. Also, if your looking for another movie like this, check out Joe Versus the Volcano with Tom Hanks.",1048636800,6,793,4.624113475177305

When his wife died, Professor Krippendorf was in a deep depression/grieving which pushed him to forget to inform his employer/ Dean of students that he did not find a lost tribe. I can't blame him for being depressed, but in order not to lose his home, livelihood and kids, makes up a tribe following the natives of New Guinea. Lily Tomlin also is part of the cast but this time she is the bad guy and tries to prove that there is no tribe at all. There is a surprise ending as his 15?year old daughter comes to the rescue at the end.

941015,3,6304938748,"Krippendorfs Tribe (1998) stars Richard Dreyfuss as the titular grieving anthropologist who is compelled to hoax an isolated tribe still living in the Stone Age. Jenna Elfman plays his assistant, Natasha Lyonne his daughter, Stephen Root his boss and Lily Tomlin his rival.

As my title blurb says, this movie spoofs Academia and the Tasaday hoax. If you're not familiar with the latter, a supposedly isolated tribe still living in the Stone Age was discovered on the Philippine island of Mindanao and prominently featured in a 1972 issue of National Geographic. In 1986 it was discovered that the Tasaday were simply members of known local tribes who put on the appearance of living a Stone Age lifestyle under pressure from Manuel Elizalde.

The movies silly and fun, but not laugh-out-loud funny, although there are a handful of mild laughs. That said, humors a personal thing, which explains why some people find this movie funny. I dont, but its likable and quietly amusing. If you're a fan of Dreyfuss and Elfman its a must.

The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area and Ka`a`awa, O'ahu, Hawaii.

Now with the help of his family he has made up a fictional native tribe in New Guinea and is trying to fool everyone to keep out of jail.

Of course, there is always the chance that the fakery will be discovered and preventing that from happening producesthe early laughs. Later laughs are built on maintaining the fiction, and final laughs on what happens when a colleague reports him a fraud.

941300,2,6304938748,"Sure, `Krippendorf's Tribe' is fun, to an extent, but it's not really as funny as it could be and in the end it is not really as enjoyable as it could be.  I found some pleasure in it, but it was limited and for the most part it relied on a more slapstick approach to its humor to get laughs, and I prefer a more intellectual approach (I know, this is not an intellectual movie but still, it could have been a little smarter).

The film tells the story of anthropologist Professor James Krippendorf who had received a grant, along with his wife, to find an unknown tribe out in New Guinea.  When his wife died unexpectedly James crashed emotionally and exhausted the money from the grant doing absolutely nothing productive and so, in fear that he'll be sent to prison for abusing the terms of the grant he creates a fictitious tribe.  His one little (or not so little) lie spirals out of control and creates a worldwide phenomenon (especially since the tribe is unlike anything anyone has ever heard of) and he finds himself documenting footage of this tribe with his children in his very backyard.  An overzealous Professor, Veronica, causes more complications in James keeping his lie a secret, and his eldest daughter's disgust for what her father has been reduced to also starts to weight heavy on James' decisions.

The problem with `Krippendorf's Tribe' lies in a few areas.  First, the concept, while promising, is not executed as well as it could have been.  It's not believable.  Sure, it's an outlandish comedy that doesn't have to be probable, but it still should be believable.  The fact that no one recognized that the tribe's people were being played by Krippendorf and his children is ridiculous since the makeup didn't hide anything really.  The fact that Veronica recognized herself on the video but the rest of the known world did not is also ridiculous.  I know that it seems like a little thing to pick at, but it really reduces the entire films legitimacy.  You want to be able to believe that someone could pull this off, but instead all it proves is that the people around Krippendorf were really, really stupid.

The film also makes it a point to go as far as they can (within the boundaries of its rating) to keep the jokes off-color, which is a shame since it shows the films lack of depth.  It's not smart enough to come up with anything but the expected toilet humor.

The acting is decent.  Richard Dreyfuss pulls his comedy off better than in `What About Bob?' but there is no Bill Murray to elevate the films mediocrity.  Jenna Elfman is not a good actress and she kind of just floats here, playing a ditzy admirer as best she can.  Really, the only highlight to the film is Lily Tomlin who is always funny, even when her material is not.  She kept me entertained, and she was really the only reason I watched the entire film.  The film can thank Tomlin for aiding it to a two star (high D) and not a one star rating.",1219968000,3,2949,4.526415094339622

  Professor James Krippendorf(Richard Dreyfess) is a Professor of anthropology and also a widower. Down in depression he ends up using the universities grant money for his own personal use. Faced with either confessing and going to jail, or going on with his fairy tale tribe. He chooses to go on with his made up tribe the Shelmikedmu. Using his own 3 kids and back yard for filming. He comes up with the most unique tribe ever seen before. Also with the help of his over anxious colleague Veronica Macelli(Jenna Elfman) who won't leave him alone. He ends up going deeper and deeper into his fairytale tribe, and trying to keep up with his lie. They end up taking the tribe national. But there is one of his colleagues Ruth Allen that just isn't swallowing all this Shelmikedmu stuff. So she decides to go to New Guinea and prove that it's all a scam. Even Krippendorf goes so far he ends up going in person and on national tv as the Cheif Utta Baji.
  This movie is very well put together, and just so ridiculous you got to laugh. In the end you will wish you were shelmikedmu too. It's definetly worth having in your movie collection and seeing.",1219622400,2,1412,4.4192307692307695
941302,4,6304938748,"I own this on VHS and it is only one of two movies I can think of that is comedic and concerns anthropology, unless you count N.C.'s early Yanomamo documentaries.  The other is ""The Gods Must Be Crazy."" Yes it is funny- they both are. It's a little bit too formulaic as a comedy to rate five stars but Lily Tomlin is hilarious as the competitive colleague. And I've always liked Richard Dreyfuss since he first stuck his head in the doorway of Dustin Hoffman's room in ""The Graduate"". Just fun.",1141084800,,494,4.428571428571429
941303,5,6304938748,"I laughed a lot.  It was a unique movie; I have never seen anything like it before.  If you like off-beat comedies like ""Captain Ron"" and ""Carbon Copy"", you'll enjoy this.  If you take things too seriously like a New York theater-goer, then this is not your film.",1117670400,4,263,4.4375
941304,3,6304938748,"Pity poor Professor Krippendorf!  His wife has died, he is doing only a so-so job of raising three dysfunctional children, and, as if he does not have enough problems already, he has sqandered money from his college that was supposed to be used to find a mysterious missing New Guinea tribe, which he has not done.  His solution?  Fake it.  He announces the discovery of a make-believe tribe, the ""Shelmikedmu"" (the name derived from his childrens' names).  One thing leads to another, and before you know it there is a national Shelmikedmu craze.  Ah, but what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.  Not all believe him and it is only a matter of time before the truth may be discovered.  Will Krippendorf succeed or will he be caught?
To give this movie credit, it has its funny moments.  Dreyfuss is good as Krippendorf, up and coming actor Gregory Smith also holds his own as Krippendorf's son.  Unfortunately, there is a major problem with this movie - Krippendorf is is the wrong!  This guy has stolen college funds, lied, corrupted the morals of his children, and we are to believe he is the good guy.  If the move has a moral, it seems to be ""it's okay to do something you shouldn't, as long as you don't get caught"".
That is a no-no.",1088035200,3,1262,4.511013215859031
