8547968,3,6304473710,"Obscure 1990s movie that aired in Japan and released only on VHS format by ADV. It's about two female mercenaries Efera and Jiliora who are very similar to Kei and Yuri (aka Dirty Pair!)- and even their designs are alike- except this story takes place in a fantasy landscape and Efera or ""Efe"" has a couple unexplained magical powers, they have swords instead of ray guns! The story is kind of weird, and if I'm honest, boring. It involves several blond children who have been taken hostage by a neighboring kingdom (whose palace looks like the Iwan Mosque in Iran) and a magical emblem that belongs to one of them, though its importance beyond that is unclear. The lead-in was unusually long and wordy (tough considering this is a subtitle only!) leading me to think this is based on an existing story that is familiar in Japan(?) Couldn't make sense of the plot much except what was visually obvious- and the two main characters seemed barely important; they aren't developed at all. This is disappointing considering that two spunky girls riding horses on an adventure has a ton of potential. Unfortunately this is a bit of a mess. Get it for the special interest for sure and share it. Family friendly more or less. You'll need a VCR.",1372723200,,1238,4.68348623853211
