7013033,3,B00TLXIRM0,"I can't believe I'm only the second person to review this quirky little movie.  If you're looking for a ""tear-'em-up-blood-n-guts"" bigfoot movie - this isn't it.  It focuses more on the relationships of two members of a small party of individuals who are about the business of making a documentary about the big guy.  The movie is well done and doesn't strive to be more than it is.  I thought the acting was very good although the chemistry between actors was a little stilted.  This can be overlooked given the random nature of the party.  The scenery is beautiful and the story moves along.  I thought it was nicely paced and it did hold my interest.  I think it pretty accurately portrays the prevailing and varying attitudes about the existence of bigfoot.  I would have liked to hear a few more personal accounts (more convincing ones) of bigfoot encounters.  I think that would have contributed to the theme of the movie a bit more - but that's just me.  What I could have lived without is the portrayal of the creature beginning at around the one hour mark.  I'm sorry but the costuming looked like it came from a muppet theater portrayal of Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy.  The sad part is that it wasn't necessary at all.  The creature was doing fine and even bordered on scary with backlit and distant shots.  All in all I enjoyed the movie.  I found it a sincere and enthusiastic approach to this mysterious subject.",1436832000,4,1428,4.607142857142857

7013075,1,B00TLXIRM0,The trailer was a lot better than the beginning of the movie.  I wish I hadn't rented it now.  I only viewed it for a few minutes when I decided to turn it off.,1440892800,,160,3.676470588235294
7013076,3,B00TLXIRM0,"The movie as a whole was average, but you can tell it had a limited budget for shooting.  The actors for the most part are good at their roles, but do not expect to be scared out of your wits or need science manuals to figure it out !?  The interview scenes and native american input helped to shore up the movie, so I gave it a three star rating.",1440633600,,347,3.942857142857143
7013077,1,B00TLXIRM0,"If you're looking for a scary bigfoot movie this isn't it. If you're looking for a found footage film about bigfoot well this isn't it either. Its a boring melodramatic love story between a man & a woman attempting to document bigfoot. Bigfoot,if thats what you want to call him,actually only makes a few appearances in the movie which are all pretty lame. Whats even more lame is the cheap gorilla costume the guy wore to pretend to be bigfoot. Its the dumbest bigfoot movie ive ever seen.",1438560000,7,490,4.579545454545454
7013078,1,B00TLXIRM0,"This would maybe be a good story line if it weren't for the actors and cheap props ruining it all. (Except for the whole having coffee with bigfoot thing). My boyfriend said. They probly spent $1000 on it and made millions off it, cuz bigfoot was in the name.",1438473600,,259,4.3061224489795915

7013080,1,B00TLXIRM0,movie was horrible don't waste time or money on it . lowest budget film ever .. bigfoot??? it was a guy in a rubber monkey suit .. wish there was something lower than one star cause that to high for this movie,1437696000,3,209,4.0
7013081,1,B00TLXIRM0,"The acting was awful, character development very weak, big foot was ridiculous looking. Overall, it was terrible.",1437350400,5,113,5.705882352941177
7013082,1,B00TLXIRM0,Would have been good but the camera quality sucks and story line is jumbled up,1437350400,,78,4.266666666666667
7013083,2,B00TLXIRM0,"The good point about this movie is the story wasn't your typical bigfoot/""We're shooting a documentary about a mythical creature and I came to believe it"" story.

The bad points are horrid acting, inconsistent production values like bad audio between cuts in the same scene, and the bigfoot effects range from a muppet looking close up (that my kids laughed at when the finally saw the face), a bad suit running around the woods, and a CGI bigfoot that would have gotten a ""C+"" grade at the technical college.

There is way too much talking (it takes around 23 minutes for them to get in the woods) and we are treated to ""Based on true events/encounters"" right off the bat (we see a sepia toned flashback that is unrelated to the main story. Makes me think the movie was trying for a different direction, initially.) The cover makes it seem like it's going to be a horror movie, but in reality it's about a guy trying to move on after grieving for his family for 5 years.

The main star (also produced) seems to have put up the money for this project. I think it would have helped to have a consultant keep the story, effects, action consistent. The female lead is painfully bad and the movie seemed to be the main star's attempt to put her in a movie (for her big break? She's in her 50s and if her acting is that bad - for her first & only entry on IMDB - THE break was this movie.) I rented this at Safeway so maybe distribution for movies like this is still alive in a sense.

7013084,2,B00TLXIRM0,"I don't really know what to say about this movie, as it's difficult to describe.  I watched it until the end, because I paid for it. I was expecting it to be a thriller, but it turned out to be more of a romance (?)  Wasn't expecting that.  On a positive note, the scenery was very beautiful.  However, there was some incredibly cheesy parts in it, and the music was simply awful. It would start and stop abruptly, and sometimes didn't go with what was taking place on the screen. The acting was bad (when I notice how bad the acting is, let me tell you it's really bad).  I'm a longtime fan of Bigfoot movies, but I wouldn't recommend this one.  I'm mad at myself for paying $2.99 for this.",1436918400,7,691,4.236641221374046
8702287,2,B00TLXIRM0,"I'm not a fan of Voice-Overs but if there was ever a film that needed one, this is it! First of all, this movie is a story of finding love after tragedy. The main character Rock Thomson (Tom Monson) loses his wife and child in an accident. From then on it's a slow decline for the character who was previously a successful documentary film maker. We see the character enduring nights of depression, drinking and reflection when an opportunity comes up. He's offered a chance to join an expedition that's searching for Bigfoot. He's also offered a lot of money. A friend finally convinces Rock  to do it for the money, if nothing else. On this backwoods adventure he meets a girl... If only they would have left it at that. What I mean is, the finding redemption angle would have sold this movie better by itself than to actually showing a very low budget Bigfoot! Regrettably, the Bigfoot in this movie looks like Cha-ka from Land of the Lost (1974). I think they were torn between developing the love story between Rock and Susan Walker (Kate Kelly Skudstad) and actually making this a Bigfoot movie. They kinda smear a little of both and hope it works. End result, it Kinda works but not so much. They don't use their screen-time very efficiently either and just fill the empty spaces with whatever favorite music they want to hear. It certainly wasn't on my top 40 list. Anyway, they end up riding the middle of the road between trying to develop a love story and kinda telling a Bigfoot story. Instead of playing random tunes they should of used a voice-over to help the audience try and understand what's going on in Rock's head. I kinda wanted to know what the heck he was thinking.

I love Bigfoot movies but the most I can say about this one is that it was a Bigfoot Themed movie. It's just not the same.",1494720000,,1812,4.487878787878788
