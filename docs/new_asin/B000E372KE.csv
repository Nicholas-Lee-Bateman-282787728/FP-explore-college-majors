8104745,3,B000E372KE,"I was really excited when I bought this. I literally have read and watched just about everything on Scott Peterson that I could get my hands on. I have read court documents, looked at pictures of evidence, read quite a few books so I consider myself to know quite a bit about the case. I found this not to be completely accurate, to be missing some of the stuff that I had found in my own looking through things to be the most interesting. It seemed like it had been put together quickly, without a lot of thought.

I don't highly recommend it, especially buying it. It was nice to watch, but i wish that I would have waited for a rerun instead of buying it.",1363996800,3,658,4.222222222222222
8104746,4,B000E372KE,"I enjoyed watching this video, but it was a little pricey.  If you wait long enough, it will replay on ""American Justice,"" the series, for free.  Enough Said.",1221868800,6,158,4.607142857142857
