2002571,2,B0001GWK56,"Sole Survivor (Thom Eberhardt, 1983)

When you watch as many movies as I do, some of the more forgettable ones are bound to fall through the cracks. This one caught my eye today, sitting there on the shelf, and I swore I'd watched it within the past couple of months, but couldn't find a note about it anywhere in my film notebook. So I popped it in and watched the first few minutes. Yep, looked familiar. So I skipped round a bit watching more and more of it and remembering. But I couldn't for the life of me remember how it ended. So I fast-forwarded and watched the last five minutes again. And now I know why I didn't remember the movie; the ending is so horribly stupid that I must have actively blocked the experience of watching this low-budget (estimated $350,000) dog that I can't believe wasn't a made-for-TV movie (it may have been, but IMDB doesn't list it that way) from my mind. It's not that the rest of the movie is as bad as the ending, it's just that it doesn't have anywhere near enough redeeming qualities to balance out the deathless stupidity of that final, unintentionally hilarious scene.

The plot will be very familiar to anyone who's seen David Hemmings' adaptation of James Herbert's wonderful novel The Survivor, the film version of which came out two years before this: a plane crashes, leaving (surprise!) one survivor, Denise Watson (Girlfriends' Anita Skinner in her second and last film role). After the accident, her therapist asks her about survivors' guilt, but she professes not to feel it. However, she starts seeing people whom she eventually realizes are ghosts of the victims, whom she believes have come to take her back to the grave with them. She tries to avoid this fate with the help of a sympathetic cop (Brian Richardson), who believes, of course, that there's a rational explanation for all this.

It's a pretty good plot (and one wonders why, in the age of American remakes of Japanese ghost stories, no one has got round to giving this one a revamp), but it's got that vintage-seventies TV-disaster-movie feel to it that pretty much guarantees a forgettable experience (and given that the movie was released in 1983, pretty much guarantees it was already feeling dated when it came out). Skinner is a relatively decent actress (""relatively"" to the rest of the cast, anyway), but she never gets across the feeling that she's actually in danger, and that seems as if it would be important in a supernatural thriller, no? So you go along, half falling asleep while watching this, and then all the sudden you're blindsided by that final scene, the contents of which I obviously can't reveal, but my god, is it funny. It's almost worth sitting through the rest of the movie just to get to the laughs at the end. It's really, really terrible, but in such a way that it almost makes this transcend its insipidity and enter the realm of such bad-movie classics as Shriek of the Mutilated and Night of the Lepus (which, despite being so very very awful, are two of my all-time favorite movies for that very reason). It doesn't get there, and the lack of unintentional humor anywhere but that last scene doesn't help, but man, that final shot? It's a killer. You've gotta see it just for that. * ",1242950400,,3240,4.669001751313485
2002572,3,B0001GWK56,"For twenty years I had searched for this film. I believe it was circa 1983-84 that I rented it on the now long defunct video disc format. I saw it once and it never left my memory. That is except for the title! While searching for clues, I found a website called ""Find That Film"" and- as the name of that website suggests, they helped me find it. This is a creepy film. It isn't the greatest movie but just as it did in the early 1980's, it gave me the willies. The acting is so-so and you can tell it was created on a rather low budget. It is reminiscent of the 1962 cult classic ""Carnival Of Souls""- which also scared the heck out of me when I was kid. A young woman is the sole survivor of a plane crash. After she is released from the hospital, weird things start to happen. She becomes bewildered at the strange people that seem to pop up in random places and stare at her. What she does not know is that these are actual people who have recently died and are trying to take her with them. All of this the result of defying a plane crash that she was supposed to die in. The soaking wet girl in the hospital garage who appears just before a parked truck loses it's breaks and almost hits the woman, the guy who walks onto the highway and causes the woman to lose control of her car, the guy staring at her while she eats at a restaurant, the creepy old man staring at her in the park, the spooky man waiting for her at the top of a parking garage escalator, the shadow of a dead man staring at her as she rides away on a night bus etc. I don't know about you but there is something about dead people watching from a distance that gives me the creeps. 1961's ""The Innocents"" comes to mind on that. After I was finished watching ""Sole Survivor"", I had a rather unnerved feeling. That means I enjoyed it. Like I said, it isn't the greatest movie but it is effective. It's an appropriate film to watch on a cold dark night snuggled with your girlfriend.",1234396800,4,1954,4.144736842105263
2002573,4,B0001GWK56,"Many horror fans who have only recently discovered the 1983 horror film SOLE SURVIVOR describe it as a precursor to FINAL DESTINATION (2000), but that is actually not an accurate analysis. True, the plots of both films revolve around people who have somehow survived a plane crash in which they were destined to die, but that's where the similarity ends.  Whereas the survivors in FINAL DESTINATION suffer inexplicable (and usually violent) deaths as an incorporeal Death seeks to realign the universe, the lone crash survivor in SOLE SURVIVOR is stalked by various denizens of the spirit world--whether ghosts or zombies the film never makes quite clear--bent on bringing her over to the ""other side."" In that regard, SOLE SURVIVOR should be considered a direct offspring of the cult horror classic CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962) rather than a progenitor of FINAL DESTINATION.

An oft-overlooked but above-average little indie horror flick, SOLE SURVIVOR is notable for bucking the trend in the era when the slasher film reigned supreme in the horror genre. Being a ghost story of sorts, it is bigger on atmosphere than on blatant slasher-type shocks and thrills, and the film consequently contains little gore or gratuitous nudity.  However, a couple of really cool blood-and-viscera FX do show up early during the shot of the plane wreckage, and the film's denouement is a tad bit sanguine.  And genre fans into T&A will want to watch for an appearance by venerable scream queen Brinke Stevens, whose topless cameo represents the film's only true skin shot.

The DVD release of SOLE SURVIVOR from Code Red presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TVs). The source print used for the digital transfer is fairly crisp and clean, though there are occasions when the picture contains excessive grain.  The soundtrack is presented in the film's original mono format and is adequate overall, but lines of dialogue seem a bit muffled at times.  Bonus materials include a feature-length commentary with the executive producer Sal Romeo, producer/co-star Caren Larkey, and film historian Jeff Burr; an interview with executive producer Sal Romeo and producer/co-star Caren Larkey; the film's original theatrical trailer; and more.

Directed by Thom Eberhardt--better known as the director of teen comedies like NIGHT OF THE COMET (1984), THE NIGHT BEFORE (1988), and the made-for-TV film RATZ (2000)--SOLE SURVIVOR is a well-crafted, atmospheric piece that, unlike most horror flicks of the 1980s, avoids the overuse of violence, gore, and gratuitous nudity, yet it mixes in just enough of those elements to keep things interesting and contemporary. The DVD from Code Red is well worth the price of admission and deserves a place in the collections of all serious horror fans.",1231286400,5,2816,5.214601769911504

2002575,3,B0001GWK56,"Sole Survivor tells the tale of a lone living women(a ""sole survivor"" if you will LOL!) left in the wake of a commercial airplane crash(in easily one of the best scenes from the film, the camera pans through the carnage until it comes to her; sitting in her seat amidst the wreckage in silent shock and completely unscathed).  Possibly suffering from the post-traumatic affliction known as ""survivor syndrome""(depression, nightmares, and anxiety caused by thoughts of being unworthy of life over everyone else killed in the accident), our lead is caught wondering if the recent bizarre happenings and people that have entered her life are truly out for her death, or is it all in her head?  Sole Survivor is definitely a well done film; it features excellent acting, effects, music, and direction throughout(Thom Eberhardt would follow this up with the 80's classic, ""Night Of The Comet"")... what it doesn't feature though, is much in the way of excitement.  This is a ""slow burn"" type of horror experience(i.e. ""The Changeling,"" ""Burnt Offerings,"" ""Don't Look Now,"" etc.) that focuses much more on atmosphere and a creepy premise rather than blood and guts or jump scares(although bare breasts do make a welcome appearance!), but for the patient it delivers with one of the best finales I've seen in quite awhile.  Out of the group of four people that I watched this with, I was the ""sole survivor"" to make it to the credits without falling asleep... again, that's not a knock on the film so much as that when I told them we'd be watching a lost horror flick from 1982 they were probably expecting something quite different(like ""The Burning"" or ""Night Of The Creeps"")... now you know the type of movie you're in for at least if you do decide to give it a watch(and it deserves at least one).  The DVD from Code Red is very nice, with a fairly clean picture in anamorphic widescreen and plenty of special features for the overly curious(or bored).",1210550400,12,1948,4.820359281437126

Other than that, I have to say this movie scared the crap out of me as a kid, and held up really well when I finally got to see it again on DVD.  Great job, Code Red!

2002577,5,B0001GWK56,"This was a very creepy movie. Not the blood and gore that a lot of them have. But intense on how it made you feel. Anxious, on the edge of your seat, old style.
We had such a blast making it. I am glad to see it is back in circulation. I hope you all enjoy it. Yes, it was very low budget but what a good experience it was. So interesting to see the behind the scenes stuff that goes on during the filming of a movie.  Being in the movie with my family and friends was fun and oh the long hours sometimes.

2002578,5,B0001GWK56,"I'm glad to see that Code Red DVD is back in action.  To inaugurate their new lease on life, they've started with a genuine lost horror classic.  I can't say I'm a big fan of most 80s horror films.  Though there were some gems, sub-par slashers, horror comedies, and teen-oriented horror dominated, leaving those who like supernatural, serious, adult horror out in the cold.  But here is an excellent exception to the rule that I'd not heard of until recently.  Advertising for and reviews of this DVD have focused on the Final Destination connection, but this is actually more closely related to the 1962 classic Carnival of Souls in mood, atmosphere, and plot if you want to make comparisons.  No elaborate death sequences here (though I do like the FD films), just a quiet feeling of mounting dread, which is nicely acted, photographed, and directed on a very very low budget.  Code Red have done their usual great job.  The print of the film is perfect, and extras include audio commentary and an interview with two of the producers (one of whom doubled as an actress in the film), the original theatrical trailer, and trailers for upcoming Code Red releases (can't wait for these).  The artwork from the original poster, re-used for this DVD, makes the film look like pure science fiction, but this is a wonderful, creepy horror film all the way.  Highly recommended.  Code Red has a lot more forthcoming, but to add my 2-cents, I'd love to see them do a deluxe reissue of the similarly atmospheric and extremeley well-done on a miniscule budget Messiah of Evil, which would make a great double feature with this film.",1207008000,14,1623,4.760714285714286
2002579,3,B0001GWK56,"In the movie there is a strange lady who actually  Predicts the plane crash and the woman surviving , but surprisingly she did not have much of a bigger role as I thought she would. I figured they would try to help each other, but it really did not turn out that way. The movie actually has some slight creepy moments, but nothing too good as for scares. the Plot is original and good. IT's obvious that Final Destination  borrowed from the story. The effects are pretty decent for the dead people and I really enjoyed the ending. The directing and acting was pretty good too. I would have given it more stars but it slowed down in parts other than that its not a bad movie.",1205193600,3,674,4.299212598425197
2002580,3,B0001GWK56,"SOLE SURVIVOR is a movie reminiscent in style and structure of the 1961 cult favorite, CARNIVAL OF SOULS.  Thom Eberhardt's script and direction are atmospheric and spooky, but the film's ultimate fate lies in the hands of a virtually unknown cast, and some muddled plot holes.

Anita Skinner plays Denise Dalton, a t.v. commercial producer, who is the only survivor of a horrendous air crash.  Kurt Johnson plays handsome doctor Brian Richardson, who tells her of survivor's potential guilt syndrome, and offers his assistance to help her through.  Oddly enough, Denise seems unphased by what has happened, although she still feels ""something is wrong...she's going to get caught...""

And soon Denise starts seeing ghostly figures, who eventually become more than threatening, they start killing people.  Denise is also confronted by a has-been actress who has visions of terrible things happening to Denise.

The viewer knows that Denise has cheated death, a topic more recently attacked by SOUL SURVIVORS.  The movie loses its credibility, however, when it seems that these dead people aren't just interested in Denise, but anyone who knows her.

Obviously a low budget film, the movie does have some eerie and effective moments.  Skinner is in over her head, we needed an actress with a better range; Johnson does okay in his role, but a lot of depth isn't required.

If you like these kind of ""esoteric"" thrillers, this one's not too bad.",1095638400,4,1443,5.097872340425532
8012658,4,B0001GWK56,"I can't believe I'm only just discovering this movie in 2017! ""Sole
Survivor"" tells of a woman who is the only person to survive a plane
crash, but although she is physically healthy she starts to be haunted
by mysterious apparitions who appear randomly, silently staring at her.
Unnerved, she searches for an explanation, while things gradually get
worse.

If you've seen ""Final Destination"" and ""It Follows"", you are going to
feel like this is all very familiar, but let's remind ourselves that
""Sole Survivor"" was made in 1983! Beating both of those movies by
decades, it's just as chilling and creepy. as either of them. It's only real precursor
is the seminal ""Carnival of Souls"", which is also a great and unnerving
story of a haunted accident survivor. The acting in ""Sole Survivor"" is
great all round, and although I thought at first this was a made-for-TV
production, the inclusion of some gore and topless nudity made it clear
that it was not. It's a real shame that it did not make a greater
impact when it was first released. The first hour is superb, it only sags a little in the final few minutes as the ending doesn't really work, But even so, I think it's really good.",1512604800,,1184,4.6380952380952385

8012661,3,B0001GWK56,"They had me right up to the moment that death's surrogates started killing people who might have a better chance to get at the sole survivor (Anita Skinner) than the few corpses that follow her around just to gawk at her.  This more or less defeats the purpose behind a ""debt to be paid.""  Seriously, an army of faux-zombies is created just to get the one who got away!?  Doesn't quite seem cost effective.

This low budget movie is based on a 1976 book (The Survivor) by OBE English horror author James Herbert.  The story is limited in scope; it's about a survivor of a plane crash trying to get back to her normal life as a TV commercial producer.  Unfortunately, Karma's calling and wants her back even if it costs the lives of innocent bystanders to get her.

There are a few scenes that give one pause but most of this movie strolls when it should be rushing to get somewhere.  I can see great potential between the scenes, like when a shadow passes her on the wall but no one is there.  Sadly, this movie just wasn't creepy enough or stylish, or fraught with heightened suspense.  And it certainly didn't help that the beginning scenes were confusing due to the disparate time elements involved.  On the whole, this movie felt more like a rough draft than a polished piece of film work.

I've seen in twice.  It has a certain indefinable quality that makes it entertaining enough to keep for future viewings.  But it is a bit on the clumsy side.",1411603200,,1452,4.47148288973384

8012663,1,B0001GWK56,"I only gave this film one star, so that means I must have hated it right?
Wrong.
Sole Survivor is actually one of my favourite films of all time, so why am I so unhappy with the DVD?
I first saw this film sometime in the late eighties when my local video rental shop was selling a load of videos off cheap.
I saw this one, noted it was a horror film about a plane crash and thought I couldn't go wrong for a few pounds.
I absolutely loved it. Even though some of the acting and dialogue was a bit ropey, it was one of the most atmospheric and genuinely creepy films I had ever seen.
And on this basis I watched it regularly, despite the fact that my ex-rental VHS copy was never that great quality to begin with.
So all these years later I finally get the chance to own it on DVD.
I put it in the player tonight...only to be extremely disappointed.
First of all the extras include an interview with a supporting actress and a producer. Now I appreciate that not only did Caren Larkey finance the film, she also gave by far the best performance of the entire cast. So on this basis one could argue that she has every right to be included in the interview.
But from a fan's viewpoint the fact is that the leading actress, Anita Skinner, never worked again. The supporting lead actress, Robin Davidson, never worked again. The lead male actor, Kurt Johnson, died three years after the film was released aged 33.
But do we get an insight into any of this?
No.
Do we get any input from the director?
No.
And the interview sounds like it was conducted by a film student who had read up on the film the night before and recorded it on a cheap tape recorder.
Now if my only gripe was with the extras, then my complaints could be dismissed as those of an anally retentive pedant.
But unfortunately, the fact is that little or no effort seems to have been made to improve upon the VHS picture quality. Daytime and well lit scenes are alright, but a lot of the nightime and dimly lit ones are extremely grainy.
I would have been quite willing to forgive all of the above, however, if it was not for the thing that has annoyed me most of all.
One of my favourite scenes in the film is when Denise becomes so freaked out by the creepy clock that she removes it from the wall and puts it in a cupboard.
Now I admit that I had a few rum and colas whilst watching the film and at first thought I'd missed it either because I'd lost concentration or nodded off.
But having found the scene on my VHS copy and then re watched the relevant part of the DVD I discovered that this scene had actually been cut!
Why?
To my mind this is sacrilege.
Another difference I spotted was that right at the end of the film in the mortuary when one of the corpses sits up, in the VHS version the mortician says ""ok"" in a sort of ironic sing song voice that is quite funny. On the DVD, however, this has been replaced by a sort of breathy ""arthur"",(presumably because his character was called Arty), but which is actually quite difficult to make out.
To be honest I was not exactly sober when I watched this film, so there may have been other differences that just washed over me, but I do know that a lot of the creepy, brooding atmosphere that I'd always experienced in the past seemed to be missing. At the time I put it down to concentrating too much on the differences in picture quality instead of just relaxing and enjoying it, but having identified at least two differences between the VHS and DVD versions, now I'm not so sure.
I appreciate that running times are only approximate, but the VHS cover gives a running time of 102 minutes compared to the DVD which shows it as 98 minutes. Four minutes seems a hell of a lot to cut out of a film that never contained any explicit gore or sex in the first place.
I expect a DVD to at least be on a par with the VHS version, preferably better.
But when a distributor puts out something inferior to it, you have to question their motives.
As Caren Larkey says in the brief introduction, Sole Survivor is actually a pretty good film. So it is a great shame that it has received such shoddy treatment in the transfer to DVD.
Next time I feel like watching this film I think I'll stick to my mangled VHS copy, which kind of defeats the object of spending money on a DVD.
