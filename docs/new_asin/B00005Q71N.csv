1645576,4,B00005Q71N,"Well I must say it is an ok video for those that like or love CKY, it isn't like the others with stunts and stuff. It's just one of those videos that tells pretty much how to rob a house but really doesn't cause it's all funny like, but overall it's a must have for the huge CKY fans... And I must brag I have all the CKY cds and videos *Smiles*",1183593600,,345,3.8055555555555554
1645577,4,B00005Q71N,"this is the best cky of all of them. this is set back in 1999, when bam, dunn, dicamillo, and (rabb) himself didn't know what they were doing. i love it and its very funny. most of the stuff on cky went into the first season of jackass. i'd buy this because its funny and oringal",1157155200,2,279,4.0

1645581,5,B00005Q71N,"If you like skateboarding, crazy stunts, and laughing every second, CKY Landspeed is the way to go. If you aren't into seeing awhole lot of nudity or other gross things, CKY Lanspeed isn't as gross as the sequels, so it's great if you want to kinda know what to expect from the other CKY films. The stunts are HILARIOUS and the skateboadring is amazing. I'd reccommend CKY Landspeed to anyone, anywhere, at anytime because it's without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.",1058400000,5,488,4.620689655172414
1645612,5,B00005Q71N,"this dvd is the funniest movie u will ever see. the prank calls and mcdonalds drive thrus make this dvd so funny. even if u hate stunts and skateboarding, buy this just for the prank calls and mcdonalds drive thrus. u will laugh every time u watch them.",1053820800,2,253,4.291666666666667
1645613,5,B00005Q71N,"Before jackass killed cky there was landspeed the hilarous debut of bam and his buddies (Bam, mike and kerry were already in skate videos). There is no jackass stars here only some raw HI8 camera work and skateboard parts. The skateboaridng is amazing in this unlike the other ones its not all Bam you see Jamie Thomas, Hockey temper, Ed templeton and lots more in some scenes, there is some very early footage on there too. I love the begging they know how to make good beggings to these videos. There is no highlight almost every skit and prank is as good as the next, almost every song on here is Cky the band and they do a hilarous cover of def leppards foolin and the rocky theme. Buy this if you want to see the best jackass stars.",1053561600,4,737,4.309352517985611
1645614,4,B00005Q71N,this dvd is the first cky video in the series. It certenly isn't the best of the series but still fun to watch. It's filled with stunts and pranks and skating. It has music by cky (camp kill yourself) and it will keep you laughing.,1051228800,,231,4.155555555555556

1645617,5,B00005Q71N,This disc is the shiz. If you're into dumb stuff mixed with crazy stuff mixed with skateboarding and violence you'll dig it. It makes me wish i had a video camera when i was a teenager. What's with that other guy comparing this disc to that mimi person on that show? That chick shouldn't be on tv. And not only her. Ted Koppel is a robot.,1039219200,,338,4.136363636363637

7949865,5,B00005Q71N,Funny.  That is really all you can say about this film.  It is exactly what you would expect from Bam and the CKY group.  If you love Jackass then you will love this.,1409529600,,166,3.9696969696969697

7949867,3,B00005Q71N,"I would have to say this is for sure my least favorite out of all the CKY dvds. It's not horrible but it just doesn't hold the magic that all the other CKY videos have. It's pretty much just the out takes from all the other videos. But I will say I really like the commentary by Bam and the crew.

Even without a shining review I would still highly recommend buying this but only if you already love and own the other CKY movies and if you are truly a die hard fan. I just couldn't have the others without having this one to complete the whole collection.

What I really want now is a CKY 5!!! Or shoot, skip 5 and just move on to 6, I don't care I just really
want a new CKY release!! I would pay $50 for one I'm craving Bam and the crew so bad. Luckily we get some of that with Jackass 3-D, and even as great as that is it will never topple the almighty CKY series. Come on Bam please release a new CKY!!",1287878400,,906,3.891891891891892
