7880843,4,630503446X,"First-rate Taiwanese drama about the tainted politics of the island.  Despite having two leads from Hong Kong, this is not a Hong Kong movie.  Mak's taut direction moves the well-thought-out script along in a compelling and gritty fashion, and the drama never slackens.  Andy Lau plays a righteous cop trying to track down proof of the corruption; he looks good here, but he is no eye-candy (for once).  But Lau is upstaged here by a staggering Tony Leung Kar-fai of ""The Lover"" fame (no relation with Tony Leung Chiu-Wai), who plays a ruthless gang leader - he is worth the entrance fee alone.  This performance proves once again that the best of Hong Kong is more than a match for the best of Hollywood.  And you get more than a glimpse on his tattooed butt.  Definitely worth catching.",1105228800,,788,4.666666666666667

7880845,5,630503446X,"Michael Mak makes very intense movies. He also incorporates a lot of human internal struggles, although not so much in this one.
Island Of Greed is about Taiwan's very tainted politics. In interviews Mak is very assured of  the realism. It shows through the story, as some events are really  familiar. But it's the movie-making, the story-telling, the actions that  make this unforgetable. Incidentally, the current mayor of Taipei Ma  Ying-Jiu is known to have done something like this.
Lau has certainly  delivered the honest cop, but the best actings are from Tony Leung and  Annie Wu. Quite phenomenal.",948585600,2,606,5.070707070707071
