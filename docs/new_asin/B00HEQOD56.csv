6157850,2,B00HEQOD56,"Adam Sandler used to be a good comedian, though some have trouble remembering when. Even I have difficulty believing that only twenty years ago he was at the helm of great comedies like ""Billy Madison"" and ""The Waterboy"", entirely due to his recent track record as an actor. In the past few years alone, he's produced and starred in a number of box-office flops like 2011's ""Jack and Jill"" and the subsequent ""That's My Boy"". Not only has he failed to make us laugh as his career has gone on but he's also failed to make money, and that's probably why he continues to turn to these formulaic and childish pieces of work, his newest being `Blended'.

Centered around two single parents who meet on an unfortunate blind date, one of which divorced and another grieving over their spouse's death, we see them quite conveniently find their way on a trip to Africa together forced to pose as husband and wife. Sounds stupid, right? Guess what, it is.

Feeling as if its story was plucked from the 80's with today's pop-culture thrown in to make it seem somewhat relevant, it treats the audience as if their stupid, throwing every mindless joke that it can on screen (one of which involving elephants making love). Ridiculous from beginning to end and certainly not in a funny way, it succeeded in making me groan and roll my eyes for two hours straight. Rated PG-13 for crude content, ""Blended"" is sure to make you cringe.",1401408000,2,1417,4.6414342629482075
6157851,4,B00HEQOD56,"Nothing too mysterious about this movie. It's just a nice, funny family movie. I believe this is the 3rd time Sanders and Barrymore have made a movie together and this time they have families with them.

Sanders loves to make jokes and this movie full of them. Of course, not all the jokes are funny and very obvious there will be one coming up. Then, many times they may take a joke too far, where it started out funny, but they ended up continuing the joke and it's not as funny as before. An example of this would be Terry Crews singing and dancing scenes out of nowhere appearances. They use Terry throughout the movie to make these funny awaked moment jokes. Yes, the first few times were kind of funny, but after seeing the 3rd to 4th time - I was done! It just got kind of ignoring after that, and trust me, there are way more than 4 times you see this joke! Like double that amount. It's too much!

I really enjoyed the younger family members performances. They knew how to act and make me believe their characters well. Sanders and Barrymore did a great job as always. It's a great family, romantic, and comedy movie all in one. People should definitely see this movie, if they love family movies.",1400889600,4,1206,4.403587443946188
6157852,5,B00HEQOD56,"Blended is definitely one of the better Adam Sandler movies in recent years. To me, it had a decent storyline, great comedy, and even some touching moments that'll pull on your heartstrings. This review may have spoilers. Sandler stars as Jim Friedman who goes on a terrible blind date with Drew Barrymore's character, Lauren Reynolds. Both have children of their own. When one thing leads to another, both Jim, Lauren and their families end up at a lovers resort in Africa. They all have a rocky start, but slowly become friends. Lauren helps Jim's daughters and Jim helps Lauren's sons. If you love Adam Sandler movies, you'll definitely love BLENDED!!!",1400803200,8,655,4.963636363636364

I ended up really liking it; it's a (more or less) kid-friendly romantic comedy with a lot of laughs.  It was funny, endearing, and Terry Crews provided some over-the-top silliness.  Worth watching!",1527379200,,284,4.875

6157967,5,B00HEQOD56,"The chemistry between Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore is great as usual.  They are so cute together.  Drew's character is divorced with a husband who disappoints his son's often while Adam plays a widower with 3 daughters.  Seeing Drew struggle with ""boy"" issues and Adam struggle with ""girl"" issues is hysterical and often very poignant.  Adam usually plays a goofball character and this isn't different, however scenes with his daughters dealing with the loss of their mother - he was amazing and not goofy at all.

Terry Crews and Wendy McLendon-Covey steal the show in their scenes - both are outstanding as usual.  The kids are all great as well.

Some ""grown up"" themes so may not be appropriate for younger kids - but laugh out loud funny and truly touching and heart warming.",1521936000,,783,4.798507462686567

It isn't until circumstances set them up in Africa on a vacation for blended families (of which the staff presume they are) that they really get to know each other. Lauren is kind and caring to his daughters and they adore her. Jim is the male figure her sons have been looking for.

If not for Drew, I never would have developed a tolerance for Adam's particular brand of humor. Together they really do work comfortably and have certainly grown on me. This movie tells a wonderful, human story as regards two families merging into one. There are ups, and there are downs.

6158251,5,B00HEQOD56,"Very cute movie! I think Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler have some great movie chemistry, and this movie just adds to that. It is a fairly clean movie in the sense that there are no explicit scenes, aside from a couple ""adult"" jokes, but I really wouldn't be offended to show this to a mature child. It's pretty funny, has some very real moments. A couple scenes where eh, maybe you should advise your child on your feelings on the matter (it does touch on a teenage boy and adult magazines, then somewhat makes the case that it was silly for a mom to object to dirty magazines, and that male influence tells you that this is perfectly okay: which isn't the best advice, but at least it's kept brief that it doesn't detract too much from the movie). Good ending, and you walk away feeling happy. Overall, I like it. I think it is definitely worth a watch.",1486512000,,855,4.383647798742138

It was even better than I had hoped!  It has a pretty good story...more of a story than many comedy-type movies.  It is a movie that single parents especially could relate to, tugs on the heartstrings 'just a little' here and there, and is really funny almost the whole way through!  It has some of the corny feel good kind of elements in it too, which may not be for everyone, but it is a really good balance of all the things I mentioned.

Wish Hollywood would make more movies like this one;  funny without being too gross, NO CURSE WORDS.  Take note Hollywood, there are a large audience of people of us out here who do not wish to see movies about murder and mayhem, and do NOT appreciate the F-bombs, GD's or any other assortment of cursing.  Our family simply does not go to the movie theater anymore.  At home, my husband and I can watch the movie first and if there is any cursing, off it goes, never to be watched again.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

I didn't get to watch all of it so as soon as I got home, my wife and I rented it on Amazon.  I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it to anyone.  The storyline was very predictable but they had a good way of getting you there.  The characters were all very good at their parts.  You tend to see some of the same characters in all of Adam Sandler's movies but I didn't mind some of the ones that showed up here.  I was glad David Spade, Chris Rock, and the rest of the gang didn't make it.",1463443200,,646,4.079365079365079

6158744,5,B00HEQOD56,"To hell with the Critics! There's something special about a movie that can make you feel so good inside - over and over!  Drew and Adam just blend so well.  There are so many goofy moments and scenario's that are pure Sandler without some of the tasteless humor of some past offerings.  We've viewed this movie about 15 times over the past six months and there's something magical that leaves good feelings each and every time - sort of like good sex is always GREAT! Interesting that the Wedding Singer backup Singer appears in the Ball Park announcers booth - dressed the same way and many other co-stars from Wedding Singer are in the Movie.

I have about 800 cable channels with all the Premiums and most content is so boring but each time this shows up we watch it for that Feel Goodness like a Junkie.  Of course, this not Shakespeare or God Father Great but it is what it is and succeeds in making you feel good!  Park your Critical nature and let go and feel it, often real life can't live up to it but see it as virtual reality of how we'd love our Blended Marriages turned out but may not have.  It's entertainment, silly as hell but feeeeels so Good !  Thank you Adam and Drew!",1459382400,9,1188,4.343891402714932

After being set up on a blind date with each other that goes HORRIBLY wrong, these two single parents keep bumping into each other again and again until due to an ill-timed break up between their mutual friends, they end up going on the same trip to Africa with their children- sharing a room. It's the perfect mix of comedy and romance as the two grow to understand each other and to give love another chance. I DEFINITELY recommend this movie.

6158853,5,B00HEQOD56,"It's definitely an Adam sandler/happy Madison film, make no mistake. It's not on par with ""Spanglish"" as far as a removal from Sandler's general film genre, but it's not as immature as ""little Nicky"" or ""big daddy"". It's middle ground...sorta like ""Click"". As I am writing this, I am surprised how many Sandler films I have seen and how many he has made. This was what I was hoping for though, after this duo made 50 first dates I seriously thought about and checked on any upcoming pairings of Barrymore and Sandler in the future. I like the wedding singer, but it was a lot more immature than ""50"", and Blended matches 50 for all its good points, heart and ridiculous antics and is possibly a little more mature. I really enjoyed Blended, in fact, I'll buy it and watch it often. The first 15 minutes are what I have been replaying in my head over and over again and laughing aloud. Seriously, this film had some good laughs, and not just between Sandler and Barrymore, but between Barrymore and mclendon-covey they had great banter!
Those two should do a film or several. I loved laughing at the film and I thought the premise and backdrop for the film-an African tourist safari catering to blended families-was really interesting. Sandler was more demure in his typical attitudes, more real it felt and Barrymore gets better looking with age, I wish they would dress her in prettier clothes, she is beautiful and authentically so.
Having started a family since ""50 first dates"", having kids and complicated families in this film made the actors and story a more enjoyable experience...The blended premise was very appropriate given today's statistics.

I didn't love everything about the film, Sandler always pushes a little too far for my taste, but it wasn't terrible, the film has many redeeming moments and the uncomfortable, embarrassing feeling that Terry crews instills in every moment he is on screen makes it all worth it.

Seriously, just watch this film if you are on the fence, it's a little unusual in the premise, delivers on production quality and is very entertaining.",1452556800,7,2088,4.813370473537605

Hilariousness ensues upon a first date at Hooters and these two keep running into one another.  Barrymore is raising all boys, and dealing with puberty and dirty magazines found under her older sons bed (she's disgusted, rips it up, then scrambles to replace the magazine!).  Sandler is raising all girls, but essentially raising them as boys,complete with boy haircuts and tracksuits.  He's also dealing with his teenage daughter entering puberty and also scrambles to deal with her ""monthly visitor"" (aka her period). The whole movie shows just how awkward and tedious it could be for single parents to date, then add each other's kids into the mix!",1443139200,,765,4.9453125

Showed the difficulties that go along with trying to get along with each other, but with that great Adam Sandler flair. Love the chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore. They need to do more movies together.  They work so well with and off each other. Terry Crews, was the best part of the movie, you never knew when he would pop up next, or what he would be wearing or doing.  Laughed my butt off on the workout scene.  If you want a great family movie night movie, This is a great one.  Beware there is some minor language in it.

There are some ""suggestive"" scenes so if you are ultra-conservative- you may want to screen it yourself first.  But it's a great movie with a lot of heart, wonderful scenery, and your kids need introduced to some ""suggestive"" dialogue sometime, right?

6159150,5,B00HEQOD56,Great movie. Today's movies are pot luck for quality and this one was really good. It was funny and sarcastic and to real life and complex with no real political correctness stupidity. The single man played by Adam Sandler actually was portrayed a touch nicer than his single mom counterpart. However a couple of real jerks of 1980's stereotypes were portrayed as fans at a little league baseball game. Most movies and politics today use 1970 attitudes to portray men as the bad fathers. This movie was really funny and had a beat to it that just kept rolling along. I may watch it again. It was that good to my tastes. It tied two people together while they were overcoming apparent personality traits before the real traits showed up. The supporting characters were almost as good as the main characters. Is Africa really that clean? The tents were immaculate and the ground was dirt free. Movies are movies and this was just fun and filled an evening with enjoyment. My wife and I loved it.

They are definitely the funniest of any of the current screen couples, I think they even rivaling some of the all time greats.  This movie is not quite up to 50 First Dates, but it has its moments.  The one liners are seriously funny.  There are even a few very touching moments, as when Drew sings to Adams kids, that made me a little misty eyed.

6159213,5,B00HEQOD56,"I had no idea this would be so funny! I loved (and own) the first two Sandler/Barrymore movies, so I was really hopeful with this one - and I wasn't disappointed! Third time was definitely a charm!

Blended is a funny, heartwarming movie that had me howling at times: the blind date...the drugstore scene...the parking lot conversation...and pretty much the rest of the movie. Sometimes I find Sandler to be a bit too raunchy for my taste, and sometimes Barrymore seems to be reciting lines rather than acting - but they were both great in this movie. The chemistry between the two was the best yet.

""Lauren"" (Barrymore) is a divorced, flustered mom raising two out-of-control boys on her own, and ""Jim"" (Sandler) is the widowed, slightly bewildered dad raising three girls as tomboys. After a disastrous blind date they can't stand each other, but ironically find themselves vacationing together in Africa on a ""blended family"" retreat. Each parent bonds with the other's kids, as Lauren provides the mothering that the girls are missing, and Jim gives the boys the attention and guidance they aren't getting from their father. And, of course, Jim and Lauren fall for each other in the process.

This is a really heartwarming movie. When I wasn't howling with laughter I was smiling and misting up a little. This is far and away the best Barrymore movie I have ever seen, and Sandler's toned-down, loveable dad role is adorable. There's still plenty of snark, innuendo, and mishaps, though, to keep me smirking - it IS Adam Sandler, after all! But overall this was a great family movie that was genuinely touching and funny.

Watched it twice from the rental and then immediately bought it for my collection!",1425513600,,1710,4.865979381443299

My favorite part is when Drew and Adams seperate families end up sharing one posh suite in a resort in Africa where blended families visit to learn how to grow closer. The film is interesting enough for adults yet subtle so kids of any age can watch with their parents.
I have watched it twice already and could watch again.  Got my boyfriend to watch it with me second time and he also got a kick out of it.  Plus its a heart warming romantic comedy.",1423353600,,535,4.134615384615385

After 45 minutes I had zero laughs, absolutely hated the main jerk characters, this is not The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, or even as good as Yours, Mine & Ours. Would rate it zero stars if possible.",1422403200,3,452,4.592592592592593
6159307,5,B00HEQOD56,"Sometimes (make that half the time) Adam Sandler films are average at best and the humor misses the mark, however Blended is thankfully NOT one of those films.  This is mostly due to the pacing of the comedy being less outrageous than usual, giving viewers time to appreciate each moment instead of forcing an excessively outrageous variety of humor down our throats.  Not that fast-paced comedy is bad, even in other Adam Sandler movies, but the slower delivery of Blended compliments solid writing to make for a decent comedy with elements of romance.

Drew Barrymore.  It's hard to believe she's the same woman I remember being a kid back in the 80's.  She barely resembles the same girl what with being an adult now.  Only occasionally do I still see glimpses of the same girl.  Anyway Blended is about Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore going on a blind date together (which is how the film starts- getting right to the point was a good idea in this case) at a um... naughty restaurant much to Drew's dislike, and the whole date turns into a disaster rather quickly when it's apparent Adam cares more about the sports event taking place on the TV behind Drew than he does a potential relationship with Drew.

However fate is a mysterious thing- they eventually meet up again at the downtown pharmacy by chance.  Adam needs to pick up tampons for his oldest of 3 daughters, and Drew needs to replace her oldest son's naughty girl magazine after she immaturely rips it apart.  The humor is really good during this segment- every joke is hilarious (including the ones by the cashier lady).  Soon after Adam has to make a trip to Drew's house to drop off a credit card that mistakenly got in his bag at the pharmacy parking lot (since they both felt ashamed for the things they were purchasing so they did a switcheroo).  Well one thing leads to another and eventually Adam and his 3 daughters along with Drew and her 2 sons take a trip to Africa... but they didn't take the trip together.  It was another coincidence.  What I find interesting about the story are all the striking similarities both Drew and Adam share but the story never acknowledges it outright- more like Adam and Drew take these coincidences as hints they belong together.  But neither one wants to admit they belong together.  They're both pretty stubborn.

This film is basically a wild adventure through Africa type of vacation film, but the humor and writing is constantly terrific.  More characters join in once they arrive to Africa such as a big-breasted luscious lady and her joyful husband (and they have a son that Adam's oldest daughter finds attractive).  A big theme throughout the movie is that Adam prefers to dress his daughters like boys due to his love of sports, so they get mistaken as boys.  Most of the characters except Adam's middle daughter get a fair amount of attention.  I guess Jane... er, the middle sibling is always the one who gets the least amount of attention anyway.  She has a habit of believing that her mother is still alive so she likes to pretend she's communicating with an invisible person.  That's her theme.

The youngest daughter is there to show viewers how much she resembles a young Drew Barrymore (adorable and smart).  As for Drew's sons, well the oldest one has an attitude and loves the ladies as evident by the girly magazine under his bed, and the youngest one takes swinging and missing at baseball pitches personally- he throws his bat and helmet, and even kicks the dirt screaming.  Basically Adam teaches him to swing better.  Other times the wild vacation aspects come in as, for example, Adam and Drew's younger son go ostrich riding and Drew Barrymore herself takes to the skies which leads to a hilarious rhinoceros scene.  Another memorable character is Drew's workmate played by Wendi McLendon Covey who tends to act bitter towards men.  I won't spoil anything, but the trip home from Africa ends on different terms than I was expecting.

Overall Blended is a great film.  I won't mention all the outrageous things that happen when Drew and Adam's family take a tour to Africa, but the story is told sensibly without ever being overbearing in the comedy department, and many of the jokes are light-hearted enough to be appropriate for teens (but not quite kids).  This movie is WAY better than that other Adam Sandler film (what was it, Grown Ups?  That movie was awful!)  Overall highly recommended.",1422403200,,4434,4.73046875
6159308,5,B00HEQOD56,Great family movie!  The parents loved it.  The kids loved it.  Rarely watch movies a 2nd time and we will watch this one at least a few more times.,1422403200,,148,4.0344827586206895

6159310,5,B00HEQOD56,"""Blended"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: After a bad blind date, a man and woman find themselves stuck together at a resort for families, where their attraction grows as their respective kids benefit from the burgeoning relationship.

The cast led by Adam Sandler (also produced) (as Jim) & Drew Barrymore (as Lauren) is pretty good. The directing by Frank Coraci is pretty good. The story & screenplay by Ivan Menchell & Clare Sera is pretty good.

The music by Rupert Gregson-Williams is pretty good. The cinematography by Julio Macat is pretty good. The film editing by Tom Costain is pretty good. The casting by Angela Demo & Barbara J. McCarthy is pretty good. The production design by Perry Andelin Blake is pretty good. The art direction by Alan Au & Andrew Orlando is pretty good. The set decoration by Andrew McCarthy & Karen O'Hara, set dressings by Maxwell Britton, Sam Carter, Emma Eunson, Jo Stuart Fox, Ryan Kutch, Chuck McCourt & Douglas Stanley, set designs by Catherine Gaum is pretty good. The costume design by Christine Wada is pretty good. The special effects coordinated by Bob Shelley & John Smith is pretty good. The visual effects coordinated by Elayaraja, Suresh & Dipankar Sarkar and supervised by Peter G. Travers is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Scott Dale, Grant Hulley & Michael R. Long is pretty good.

This is a pretty good comedy. This is also a pretty good reunion (10 years to be exact) for Sandler & Barrymore, in their third movie together. It isn't better than ""The Wedding Singer"" & ""50 First Dates"", but it is still, decently good, nonetheless.",1422403200,,1607,4.815217391304348

6159554,3,B00HEQOD56,"So I was invited/encouraged/forced to watch this movie during the holidays, as we had 14 guests in (two families with five kids apiece), and both started raving about the greatest, most hysterical movie in the history of stuff . . Blended! ""Certainly,"" thought I, ""they can't be talking about the Sandler/Barrymore movie?"" Alas, they were. I decided to sit through it to earn points with the wife. Did it work? Time will tell.

Given my ankle-high expectations, two or three stars seems about right. I'm feeling generous, so three it is. ""Blended"" isn't aggressively awful, and it's not really even ""bad"" compared to, say, a lot of the stuff served up on the Disney Channel. Unfortunately, it's also not ""good"". More to the point, it's the bleedin' definition of ""generic."" Is ""extraordinarily average"" a thing? It is now. It may occupy your attention for a couple of hours. If you have any expectations beyond that, (and why in the world would you . . it's a Sandler/Barrymore movie) and you have even a slight interest in film, you're going to be grumpy afterwards.

Setups for completely predictable confidence-boosting transformations of the Sandler character's kids? Check. Cheap PG-13 gross-out gags inserted every five minutes? Check. Pratfalls aplenty? Check. Improbably ""zany"" characters inserted into scenes now and then only because the director decides ""well, this is dragging . . time for a big laugh I guess . . Terry and/or Kevin! Go do zany stuff!!"" Check . . too damn many checks in that department, matter of fact. Unnecessary ""bad guy"" trying to mess up everyone's good vibes near the end? Check. Valuable lessons learned by all by the end? Check.

So, I love my family, but good LORD they gots no taste in movies. Not ""bad"" taste -- no taste, and there's a difference. They just have no idea that movies can offer more than a few harmless chuckles for two hours. Nor do they care. I just wish that some future Christmas I'll be ""allowed"" to choose the movie we watch together. I've sat patiently through enough processed cheese to make nachos for half the United States. Is there no end to my suffering? I've been good . . I just gave a non-Punch Drunk Love Adam Sandler movie three stars! I've suppressed my inner snob as much as I can!

6159555,3,B00HEQOD56,Typical Sandler and Barrymore combined humor. They work well together but I don't think they'll ever recapture their on-screen comedy chemistry like in 50 First Dates. They were BOTH totally upstaged by Terry Crews' character 'Nickens'. We kept looking for his character's random scene interjections and his funny moves.

Sandler and Barrymore are as they have been in their past movies, they have a fun chemistry between them, but they are pros in this business and seem to be able to create good chemistry with who ever their co star is. It certainly promotes family values of loving one another, sacrificing for your children and placing their needs before our own.  It is a movie that has a happy ending and yes, I know that life does not frequently give up happy endings or even happy pauses before the next round, but a movie can allow us to escape for a while into a fantasy and let us leave the reality of our lives and explore the realms of ""what if"" or ""wouldn't it be nice if.""

6159686,5,B00HEQOD56,"I didn't know if I could continue watching after the first date scene when he was asked why his wife left him, and he replied ""cancer"".
I had just lost my wife the same way after 30+ years together. However, I stuck it out and found it helped show that life can go on with a different ""partner"". I was surprised that small movie children would use gutter language at such a young age, so if you're not raising your kids that way, then this is not a ""family movie"" they should watch. At the end, I felt OK with  seeing how a new family could be formed and life could go on again and the past could be remembered without it becoming a psychotic delusion that the ghost of the former mother was actually present with the youngest girl.",1419292800,,732,4.228571428571429

Instead I was annoyed with the stupid pointless dialogue and constantly removed from the moment by the highly unrealistic scenes and events that happen constantly throughout the film.

I enjoyed Grown Ups more then this. Yikes!",1418860800,,465,5.1866666666666665

6159795,3,B00HEQOD56,"Don't watch this expecting to see Hepburn & Olivier. If you like Sandler's humor, you ought to like this. Personally, I think they cut into the potential market of adolescents with entirely too much vulgarity. At least, I prefer to think responsible parents would not allow their young children to see this. The shot of the young teen girl in the parasail with the obvious ""cameltoe"" was much too risque, especially since it was specifically alluded to immediately thereafter by a boy claiming he thought he saw an eagle (or some such bird). An older man responded with something like, ""You saw a camel."" Not exactly a veiled reference. Bawdiness aside, it does have its moments of tenderness and good humor. It's just another Sandler/Barrymore rom-com, light and an enjoyable enough piece of fluff for teens and adults.",1418428800,,820,4.949275362318841

6159907,3,B00HEQOD56,"The combination of Drew and Adam is a guarentee for successful chemistry. The boy's who played Drew's son's were not beliveable as Drew's son's at all. The one boy was way to perverted. Plus NO MOM would go out at 11 at night to by her kid a porno. And the younger boy was to weird. the running gag of hitting his head was old and tired after the second time it happened. He wrote the boy's parts like a olld ADAM SANDLER MOVIE ie Billy Madason, Waterboy. Adam needs to stay far away from writeing parts of boy's in his future movie's. He did a great job in BIG DADDY but almost blew it big in BLENDED. This movie was almost ruined be the two actor's who played the boy's. The girl's were written to a ""T"" all beliveable. I love Adam's connection with the Wizard of OZ each Sandler/Barrymore movie I watch I look forward to were he's gonna put it in. And alway's think he did it at the perfect spot. This was a pretty good movie if you can get past the two boy's part's the love story between a Dad and his girls was AWESOME.

6160269,5,B00HEQOD56,"At just under two hours long, this is one of Adam Sandler's best movies.  He uses a little bit less crude humour than most of his earlier work so it will be more universally appealing to those who aren't into that sort of movie.  If you liked the movie Just Go With It with Sandler and Jennifer Aniston, this one follows a similar formula. The kids of the other person slowly grow on each other, as do both adults who previously couldn't escape a blind date days before. Both are pretending to be in a relationship so they can have a free family holiday by impersonating their work colleagues who pulled out at the last minute.

Like all Sandler movies there's a few unrealistically far fetched scenes such as a riding ostriches one and this African resort seems to also have a massive amount of frontline staff that you'd think would make them uneconomically viable, but overall the film is a lot of fun.  Granted you know where the plot is going to go, but that doesn't mean you don't enjoy the journey there.",1415145600,,1011,4.478260869565218

6160301,3,B00HEQOD56,"As a huge fan of The Wedding Singer, I have been hesitant to watch Blended because Adam Sandler's past few movies haven't been worth my time. I do really like Drew Barrymore though, and opted to give Blended a try. I'd like to say this movie was perfect, but there are some scenes that had me wanting to pull my hair out. It's better than he's done in a long time, but still had annoying moments that made it hard to love it.

The Plot

Drew plays a single mom, her husband cheated on her, thus ending their marriage. Her sons pay heavily for their dad's attitudes. He's happy coming and going when it suits his schedule, even if it means disappointing his sons repeatedly. Drew owns her own closet organizing company with a friend. Following a horrible blind date with Adam Sandler (he took her to a Hooters of all places), Drew is ready to give up on dating, while her best friend announces that she's in love. When Drew's ex cancels a rafting trip he'd been planning with their sons, she decides to fill in and provide her sons with spring break memories they won't forget.

Adam plays a widower with three daughters. Beyond the disaster of a date with Drew, his job at Dick's Sporting Goods happens to link him to her anyway, as his boss is the guy Drew's business partner is falling in love with. Adam has a hard time letting his little girls grow up, even though his oldest is 15 and ready to get out of the tomboy phase her father has locked her into. His girls are also sick of spring break camping trips and hope for something different this year.

When Drew's friend learns her boyfriend has five kids and plans to bring them with them on their non-refundable trip to Africa, she dumps him. This leaves the trip to Africa up for grabs. Drew immediately asks her friend to get her a ticket and two kids tickets, and Adam learns of the cancelled trip and asks his boss for tickets for himself and his three girls.

Upon their arrival in Africa, they find they're going to have to share the gigantic family suite together and decide to make the most of it. The more time they spend together, the more the children start to benefit from this unexpected blending, and the question arises if there is love in the cards after all.

The Chemistry

To me there is no doubt that Sandler and Barrymore, however unexpected, have some of the best on-screen chemistry there is today. I love them together. That said, the kids work really well in this too. Drew gets to show off her maternal side, and it's not surprising that Adam is the father figure, albeit a wacky one, the boys so desperately need.

The Downfall

Here's the one issue I had. Once they are in Africa, there is an a cappella group and their lead, played by Terry Crews (former NFLer). They make random appearances where Crews breaks out into some corny song that usually becomes a launch pad for him to be sexually suggestive. I grew really, really tired of this. It broke up the movie's flow and did nothing to enhance the storyline. I'd love to watch this again after editing out those unnecessary sections. I think with a few scenes taken out, this could be my favorite rom-com between Sandler and Barrymore.",1414886400,,3176,4.471502590673575

Acting & story are virtually non-existent.  It was so bad we had to turn it off - the acting was stiff and strange with Barrymore screaming (really) instead of speaking.",1414368000,3,276,4.5

6160365,2,B00HEQOD56,"Not funny at all, Not heart-warming, though that is what they were obviously going for.  Stupid plot, with stupid situations.  Could have worked if Adam Sandler had any appeal at all. But he is still a crass 12 year old boy when it comes to humor.  i seriously don't understand why anybody would put him in leading man roles! He got lucky once, maybe twice with 50 First Dates and The Wedding Singer.  But instead of growing into a more mature actor, he has regressed to his SNL days.  Drew Barrymore is charming, but she could not save this horrible script.",1414281600,,558,4.485148514851486

Love the storyline that is realistic to these two stars as they age in real life.  In Blended, they are single parents, out to snag a vacation of a lifetime for them and their children, when both families (he and his 2 sons and she with her 3 daughters) are thrown into the mix together by happenstance, and the parents find they are more and more attracted to one another.",1414195200,,532,4.589473684210526
