8750079,5,B00030CKF0,"So pleased to have tracked down this very rare film starring Koo Stark, the girl who used to be Prince Andrew's love interest.  Well worth seeing if you've never managed to catch this film before, but I suspect you'll only be able to track down second hand VHS copies, like the one I managed to buy, as it remains extremely hard to find.

Very happy with my purchase and even though it was quite expensive for a VHS tape, I think it was well worth it.",1454716800,,451,4.232558139534884
8750080,3,B00030CKF0,I saw this movie back in high school and picked up a copy of it a few years ago. It is a fun sexual romp. The scenes between 'Emily' and her older more mature female teacher/artist friend are the best in the movie. Not an Academy Award winner but it is worth a peek.,1225238400,3,266,3.9444444444444446
