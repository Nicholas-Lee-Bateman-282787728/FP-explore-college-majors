1411049,5,B00005A1SY,"Anyone who has seen this will recognise the words of Mrs Doyle! This is really very funny. If you like your comedy a bit strange, you'll love this. The series is set on Craggt Island, somewhere of the coast of Ireland. In a house on the island live 3 priests the catholic church wishes to forget. Father Ted would like to think he is hip and trendy, but fails miserably to impress anyone. With Father Dougal, it is a mystery how he ever became a priest because he is so gormless. Finally, Father Jack is a foul-mouthed drunk, who spends most of his life in a drunken stupor in his armchair.  This unlikely three some get into all sorts of scrapes, and are aided whenever they need a cup of tea by their insane housekeeper, Mrs Doyle.  The laughs are non stop, and the off the wall humour makes you want to watch it again and again.",995932800,16,831,4.286624203821656

1411054,5,B00005A1SY,"I say ""damn, this is a good show!""  This show is just a riot.  Father Ted is a very serious priest in charge of a tiny parish on one of the most miniscule Irish islands.  One of his subordinates is dangerously daft and naive; the other is an insane and senile older priest who reacts catastrophically to just about any kind of stimulant.  It's a sitcom, nothing groundbreaking, but it's sidesplittingly funny.  All the actors involved are talented people, and they work together with a wonderful, natural style - no one is straining for laughs here.  Every episode is rewatchable at least a hundred times.  If you've ever hurled an Andrew Greeley book across the room in anger at its depiction of superhuman, wonderfully understanding Catholic priests, you'll appreciate this show.",989193600,9,781,4.916030534351145

1411086,5,B00005A1SY,"I absolutely love Father Ted. I was introduced to the show several years ago, and have been a fan ever since.

Wikipedia sums up Father Ted as this:
The show follows the misadventures of three Roman Catholic priests who live in a parish on the fictional Craggy Island, located off the west coast of Ireland. Father Ted Crilly, Father Dougal McGuire and Father Jack Hackett live chaotically together in Craggy Island's parochial house, along with their housekeeper Mrs Doyle, who always wants to serve them tea.

The three priests answer to Bishop Len Brennan, who has banished them to Craggy Island as punishment for different incidents in their past: Ted for alleged financial impropriety (apparently involving some money 'resting' in his account and a child being deprived a visit to Lourdes so that Ted could go to Las Vegas), Dougal for something only referred to as the ""Blackrock Incident"" (resulting in many nuns' ""lives irreparably damaged""), and Jack for his alcoholism and womanising, particularly for an incident at a wedding.

The show revolves around the priests' lives on Craggy Island, sometimes dealing with matters of the church but more often dealing with Father Ted's schemes to either resolve a situation with the parish or other Craggy Island residents, or to win games of one-upmanship against his nemesis, Father Dick Byrne of the nearby Rugged Island parish.""

That just gives a general overview of the series. I bought this as a gift for my brother but I've watched the entire series several times. While you can view most episodes via youtube nowadays, the comedy of Father Ted can be appreciated still after several viewings. A great gift for any fan!",1417478400,,1678,5.003584229390681

1411090,4,B00005A1SY,"As a Catholic I was interested in a sitcom revolving around three Irish priests on a fictional island.  But when you fully absorb ""Father Ted"" you realize it has nothing to do with Catholicism or priests and much more to do with off-the-wall bizarre situations, weird characters, and side-splitting hilarity!
The title character of Father Ted (comedian Dermot Morgan) is a fairly decent, middle of the road guy who is just trying to get through life without much hassle or worry... unfortunately for him he lives with two poles of insanity in the form of young Father Dougal McGuire (comedian Ardal O'Hanlon), a blissfully stupid man-child who is by default Ted's second banana and older Father Jack Hackett (actor Frank Kelly), a cranky, expletive spewing volcano of fury and anger (played for laughs of course)!  Thrown into the mix is the housekeeper Mrs. Doyle (actress Pauline McLynn) a perfect representation of the kind of sweet, old Irish-Catholic lady who lives to make tea for the priests.
Each episode presents a unique, weird plot with problems that must be overcome by Ted with Dougal (Fr. Jack and Mrs. Doyle are sorely underused in these episodes).  I have to give kudos to writers Graham Linnihan and Arthur Matthews for their comedic genius with Ted and the crazy inhabitants of Craggy Island. Would anyone ever think to have priests take part in an Elvis look-alike contest?
This first series is funny but not as funny as it could be... compared to the insanity of it's other episodes these are actually pretty tame.  Don't worry, things get better in series 2...",1409356800,,1581,4.910112359550562

1411124,4,B00005A1SY,"Once upon a time, on an Irish island so small that it didn't appear on the maps, there lived these three priests... yeah, it sounds like the setup for a joke or a really bad religious story. Fortunately it turns out to be the theme for ""Father Ted - Complete Series 1,"" a kooky comedy about some painfully unholy priests -- moderately crude, quite goofy, and full of insanity.

On Craggy Island, there's a single Catholic parish run by three priests -- long-suffering Father Ted (Dermot Morgan), half-witted  Father Dougal (Ardal O'Hanlon), and deranged foul-mouthed lecherous alcoholic Father Jack (Frank Kelly). They also have a crazy housekeeper obsessed with tea. The priests aren't exactly holy, since all three have been exiled there for various misdeeds.

And as the show opens, Father Ted receives a call from the TV show ""Faith of Our Fathers,"" who wants to come to Craggy Island and interview him. Of course he tries to keep Dougal and Jack from finding out, but his efforts to keep this interview secret go horribly awry.

Among their other problems: Ted and Dougal deal with a guest priest who is devastatingly boring, protest the blasphemous pornographic film ""The Passion of St. Tibulus"" at the hostile bishop's demand, and babysit an alcoholic TV host while preparing for a costume competition. Additionally, Ted develops a crush on a sexy author, and Father Jack is found seemingly dead after chugging a bottle of floor polish.

Small warning: ""Father Ted"" is definitely not for anyone who wants an all-sparklyhappysunshiny depiction of Catholic clergy, because... well, there's a reason these guys were exiled to Craggy Island. Except for despair, I'm pretty sure the priests on this show manage to commit all the seven deadly sins, plus Dougal's unofficial sin of mind-blowing idiocy.

And it's quite funny. It's not quite as funny as ""Blackadder"" or ""Fawlty Towers,"" but it's got plenty of entertaining stuff here. There's lots of slapstick, strange problems (""Ah no, not Toilet Duck again!"") and the priests being rather unpriestly (""Father."" ""Yes Tom?"" ""I killed a man."" ""Did you, Tom? I'll have to talk to you later. I'm doing an interview for the television"").

And there are some running jokes that push the series just over the line into ""surreal"" -- Father Dougal somehow became a priest despite no solid belief in God, religion, the afterlife or anything except TV celebrities. Not to mention Jack's crazy drunken rants, a couple who constantly inflicts bloody injuries on each other, and Mrs. Doyle's obsession with tea and sandwiches.

Morgan is quite good as the ""straight man"" of the cast, who is the most normal despite having stolen charity money -- he's constantly dealing with the idiocy around him with a kind of resigned patience (""He loved children... they were terrified of him, though""). O'Hanlon is thoroughly entertaining as the peabrained Dougal, Kelly makes a wonderful gnarled old drunken coot (""NUNS! NUNS! Reverse! Reverse!""), and Jim Norton has a small role as a hostile bishop with a dirty little secret.

""Father Ted - Complete Series 1"" features the worst Catholic parish in the world, if you consider both priests and parishioners. But it does make for some very funny comedy.",1277424000,3,3228,5.0299625468164795
1411125,4,B00005A1SY,"My wife lived in London for a few years and has a taste for British comedies. I also enjoy them but to a slightly lesser degree. Well, lately she brought the ""Father Ted"" Series 1 VCR home and we have enjoyed viewing it enough that we finally ordered the Complete Series 2. It's enjoyable and quite funny stuff. Four nutty priests on a bleak glaciated island off Ireland. What a setting for a situation comedy! Actually, I'm a geologist and I find the glacial topography, together with the human hedgerows, a landscape that makes compelling viewing. Some of the glacial topography is textbook stuff and beautifully photographed! And I've never seen a greener landscape!

I've enjoyed the episodes, but two factors decrease my viewing pleasure. First, I'm not Catholic and, in fact, I'm not religious, so I miss a lot of the humor slanted in that direction. It's minor, I suppose. A second factor is the laugh track. It's been years and years since I viewed a comedy with a laugh track and I'd forgotten how annoying this supposed aid could be. Personally, I think the series would be much better if the viewer could watch and decide for oneself what is funny and what is not. The laugh track on this series actually decreases the humor of the program. In any case, it's an enjoyable series and my wife and I are now into viewing Series 2, a high compliment.

Three Irish Priests have been exiled to Craggy Island, off the coast of Ireland, as punishment for various misdeeds which you learn more about in episode 3.  The show is full of crazy characters and strange visiting priests.
Dermot Morgan is great as Father Ted, who has the most sense of anyone in the parish house, but is quite selfish for a priest.
Ardal O'Hanlon is perfect as the clueless Father Dougal, and doesn't really seem to believe any of the things priests are supposed to believe - things like eternal life and all that.
Frank Kelly is Father Jack, always drunk and cursing and lustful.
Pauline McLynn plays Mrs. Doyle, the housekeeper who is always trying to force tea and sandwiches on the guests.

1411130,5,B00005A1SY,"Ted is probably the funniest thing ever likely to be produced on television anywhere in my lifetime. Ever. If you want to start a conversation with someone in Ireland, with the potential to lead to insults and/or fisticuffs, you could stick to the more mundane territory of politics or religion, but why not go a different way..start a heated discussion on the best episode of Ted!

The problem with Ted is that, if like me, you have watched each episode of each series (and the Xmas special ""they tell me its the biggest lingerie section in Ireland..."") dozens of times; your favourite is constantly changing. Its like trying to find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, when you think you are there, it feckin well moves again. That's the beauty of Ted; you can watch it time and time again and always see new stuff.

The clever thing about, and also what in my view makes it superior to Fawlty Towers in every way) it also its cultural setting. Ireland really is like that sometimes, especially ""The Country"". The ""setting"" for Ted (Craggy Island) is generally accepted to be the Aran Islands off Galway (although the parochial house and many of the scenes are actually in Clare). Two of the Aran Islands, Innismore and Innismaan are perpetually locked in a ""battle"" to as who can claim to be the real ""Craggy Island"". Which in itself sounds like a plot from Ted.

Episodes like ""The Passion of St Tibullus"", the one with the Holy Stone of Clonrichert and those where Bishop Len Brennan has a son are all based on actual events, and I've been to rural Irish fairs where they almost do have a Tunnel O'Goats (no Spider Baby though).

My current favourite is probably ""Kicking Bishop Brennan up the Arse"", because I love his character so much, ""don't you call me Len you little bollix"".

There has never been anything quite like Ted, before or after. It's nice to see so many American fans, because the humour doesn't really translate in all its true subtlety, even to England. I'm English and Protestant and my Irish Catholic wife tells me I cant understand how close to the fabric of Irish life Ted exists.

If you want a little more true Irish humour (to make those who claim Ted is Irish, not Anglo-Irish in origin, happy), I might suggest you track down episodes of ""Killiniskully"", written by, and starring, Pat Shortt (Tom in the I-shot JR t-shirt) which also gives a flavour of Irish humour from ""The Country"".",1230854400,,2425,4.614849187935035

1411157,5,B00005A1SY,"It is probably cheaper and better to buy the box set as there are 5 episodes per disc and 4 discs in total. Father Ted ran for three seasons for a total of 25 episodes. The sound is Dolby 2.0 Stereo. The frame is 1.33:1. Season one episode one introduces us to Craggy Island in ""Good Luck, Father Ted"". Instantly within the first minute you are hit with several outragous gags involving either Ted refusing tea from a very hyperactive Mrs. Doyle, Dougle's dream about the Spider-baby which he thinks is real or Father Jack attacking the television in his drunken senility. The star of this show though is Tom, the guy with the I SHOT J.R. t-shirt and the shotgun who blows away the friendly crow. ""Entertaining Father Stone"" is more of the same but here additional priests are introduced, a constant theme that would continue through to the end. Fr. Paul Stone has the reputation of being the most boring man on Earth and nearly drives Ted & co insane. ""The Passion of St Tibulus"" is a classic episode that involves the hysterical Dougle one-liner about the son that wins all hands down. It also features a real life take on a Irish Bishop who got his cousin in America pregnant. This is the make or break episode that put Father Ted on the map. Repeat viewing is mandatory. ""Competition Time"" sees Ted, Dougle and Jack compete in a pop idol contest on Craggy Island that is exclusive for priests. From the drunken judge who smashes up the priest's home to the three stages of Elvis competition finale, this is a classic howl-a-second episode.  ""And God Created Women"" sees Ted up to more priestly things when romantic novelist Polly Clarke seems to be coming onto him.  ""Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest"" is a funny episode about cocaine cakes and a close call with death. Unfortunately Season one is very short with only 5 episodes. The budget is somewhat limited as it was a UK based Channel 4 funded show of an Irish production. It would not air in Ireland until after Season one was over. It was Ireland that responded in a way that caused Father Ted to become a sensational event where pubs would all go quiet to watch it. Catholic Ireland loved it so much that Father Ted was given a budget boost injection to double the episodes for a 11 episode Season two. Like we said it is probably cheaper and better to buy the box set. *As a note the discs where not in the best condition as Disc 1 had some playback errors in Episodes Two and Three.*",1162598400,3,2443,4.487640449438202

One.  The Vicar of Dibley is not an 'off-beat' British comedy.  It is a straight down the line, populist, bog-standard, mainstream effort.  (Think Will & Grace but even less funny).  It is also crap.

Two.  Ditto the Darling Buds of May, which as an ITV production is even more populist.

Three.  There is only one comedy (other than 'Father Ben', of course) about 'three priests on an island.'  That is the point of saying that Father Ted is the best example of the genre.  It is a facetious claim, ironic in nature.  No one who ripostes `Good heavens, how many can there be?' should be reviewing comedy.

Others have noted that Father Ted is an Irish, not a British, comedy.  It is still closer to British efforts than, say, Seinfeld but does have a distinct edge that, not being Irish myself, I can only assume is Irish.  I wouldn't say that Father Ted makes the British look as if they have no sense of irony by any stretch of the imagination.  It is more surreal and the humour is more gentle than a similar British comedy would be - most English satire is combative and aggressive in nature (e.g. Blackadder), while Father Ted has a keen eye for absurdity and examines it without rancour.

As stated above, the crux of Father Ted is absurdist comedy.  It uses this very well, although the second series does it better - perhaps because the show had got into its stride by that stage.  Father Dougal is the idiot priest, Father Jack the inapprpriately behaived priest and Ted is the priest with whom we identify - albeit that he has his own foibles.  Amongst these are thrown some pretty everyday events that our protagonists' inadequacies magnify into solid & intelligent farce.  It is a strong setup that goes some way to explaining why there are three very successful series of the show extant.

Father Ted is also not a BBC comedy, although BBC worldwide distributes it.  It is in fact a Channel 4 show.  Channel 4 was originally an off-mainstream channel with a predominantly arts, social interest and documentary remit.  This is hardly the case anymore but they do have a different (& rather smaller) audience than BBC1.  This is relected in the difference between comedies such as Blackadder and Ted.  The former is a bit of a behemoth in British comedic terms, while Father Ted is a little more experimental.",1104451200,11,2414,4.632075471698113
1411163,5,B00005A1SY,"absolutely hilarious. A sharp, funny look at religion and some of the eccentricities surrounding those who practice it vocationally.

It's difficult to come up with funnier TV than this. If you like british (oh, okay... Irish) comedy, heck, if you have any sense of humor at all, you'll love Father Ted.",1095379200,6,303,4.9411764705882355
1411164,5,B00005A1SY,"First of all, this is NOT an ""English"" series or a ""Brit-com.""  As the creators of the show commented, ""it's an Irish show"" that used ""English resources.""  It demonstrates a particularly Irish sense of humor in that NOTHING is off limits.  Also, the Irish make the English look as though they have no sense of irony whatsoever.  Father Ted leaves no opportunity for a joke unexploited, no matter how small.  Sure it's silly but so what?",1092096000,6,436,4.684210526315789
1411165,5,B00005A1SY,"Father Ted is perhaps the funniest thing to appear on British T.V. in the last decade.  The plot revolves around the titular Ted, an Irish priest sent to a remote island parish for ""financial irregularities"" (he took a holiday to Las Vegas, using money from a charity appeal to send a dying child to the Lourdes shrine, that happened to be ""resting in his account"").  His companions are the clueless Father Dougal and the alcoholic Father Jack, neither of whom are deemed sane enough to unleash on a real parish.
 The humour is sharp and surreal, derived from a mixture of Seinfeld-esque vacuity and Red Dwarf-esque situationalism.  The characters are particularly well created and the incongruity of their behavior with their priestly calling adds to the fun factor.
The plots in these early episodes are perhaps not as well developed as the later series, but still very very funny, irreverent, and much more subtle than someone chasing a cow, or a vicar being overweight and female in the manner of more traditional British comedies.
Discerning viewers who care to sit through more than one episode of this Series will be themselves richly rewarded.  Anyone who doesn't grasp the irony of the statement on the box that this is ""possibly the best comedy about three priests on an island...ever!"", should perhaps go write a 351 word letter to their conressman about the declining morals of today's society and then go for a nice lie down and then rent something a little more safe and quiet, like ""Last of the Summer Wine"".
Anyone who likes alternative British comedy like ""The Office"", ""Monty Python"" or ""Blackadder"" should snap this up right away. Go on go on go on !!!!
P.S. Father Ted was actually made for the U.K's more ""hip"", Channel 4, but is licensed to BBC America for sale in the States.",1076457600,13,1798,4.787096774193548
1411166,1,B00005A1SY,"I must admit first off that I only watched the beginning episode on this six-episode DVD before cutting my losses and packing it in. My wife viewed perhaps the first ten minutes before deciding that washing the dishes was a better time investment.
The Irish isle of Craggy Island is home to three priests in this BBC comedy mini-series. I use the term ""comedy"" loosely. There's Father Ted (Dermot Morgan) and his young assistant, Father Dougal Maguire (Ardal O'Hanlon), whose chief duty appears to be caring for the previous parish pastor, the aged Father Jack Hackett (Frank Kelly). In the first episode, at least, Fr. Jack's role is limited to sitting drunk, insensate, or simply in the throes of senile dementia in his favorite chair, aroused only long enough to throw empty booze bottles at the television, drool uncontrollably at the memory of young, Catholic-school girls long past, or shout incoherent deprecations at Father Dougal. Dougal, on the other hand, has the mind and mannerisms of a silly adolescent. Compared to these two, Father Ted is so normal as to be boring. The plot of this first episode also involves the host of a national television broadcast coming to the island to interview Father Ted on the topic of priests in isolated places. (In the only marginally good line whatsoever, Ted tells the visitor over the phone that he'll know he's reached the island when he sees the boats painted with radiation symbols dumping nuclear waste into the sea.)
Admittedly, I probably didn't give the series a fair shake. But what I saw was so boring, so tasteless, and so stupid that it doesn't even rise to the abysmal level of current American sitcoms. There are several off-beat British telly comedies available on video to U.S. audiences that are infinitely better, including THE VICAR OF DIBLEY and THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY.
The jacket containing the FATHER TED DVD claims that it's the ""best comedy about three priests on an island"".  Good heavens, how many can there be? And imagining the plots and quality of the others simply boggles the mind.",1076371200,7,2064,4.880341880341881
1411167,5,B00005A1SY,"I watched Fr. Ted for the first time last year when I couldn't sleep and happened to turn on BBC America.  I fell in love with the show right away.  Next week I actually set my alarm clock for 2:55 a.m. so I could turn on the TV and watch Fr. Ted at 3:00 a.m., and did the same week after week in order to watch it.  Words alone in the show are not the only things that are funny but also the facial expressions of the actors and actresses, background scenes, props, etc.
  When I was at a retail store one day I happened to be looking in the DVD section and found Fr. Ted, Series 1 - when I saw it I picked it up right away and bought it. I then bought Series 3, but I have not been able to find Series 2 - until now on Amazon.com. Guess what, I plan to buy Series 2 also.
  A must see by people who love to laugh, and from a review I read - by people who are serious also.  As a saying goes laughter keeps a person younger and this show will keep you laughing.
  A few characters not noted are:  Tom: Who wears a shirt saying, I shot J.R., who has an expression of a maniac.  John and Mary:  A married couple who are constantly bickering but whenever Fr. Ted sees them -act as the happiest couple in the world.
  I can't say enough about this show.  It is something that people will have to watch for themselves and decide if they like it or not, but everyone I talk to like or love it.",1076371200,4,1388,3.9035714285714285
1411168,5,B00005A1SY,"I first casually watched this series as an alternative to being bored with expectations set at the moderate bar.  As you might have guessed I was blown out of the water and into the pews by the quick to anger Father Jack.  George Whitefield may have jerked tears from his audience with his eloquence in the Great Awakening, but Father Jack captured my laughter and attention with his drunkeness and hilarious antics.  Stealing most every scene from Fathers Ted and Dougal, I found myself so enthralled by him that I call the series with my friends ""Father Jack"" and eagerly await series two and three.  Well done.  Praise Jesus",1065571200,3,627,4.715596330275229
1411169,5,B00005A1SY,"If you are not like many of the other reviewers already familiar with British comedy shows, I think this is one of the best ones to see first. (And probably Fawlty Towers too) There are two reasons why this show is a good one to watch
First, BBC comedy unlike American is simplistic. There are no need for too many up-coming stars and the route shenanigans. What you see is what you get.
Second, other than the typical ""what's the moral of the story"" that American shows have (which is fine and dandy, but sometimes ""Ho, hum""), this show is more about the humble comedic nature of its characters. Father Ted is a down-on-your-luch priest that has the same vices that we all have. Father Dougal is the young inexperienced idiot priest. Father Jack is just a cranky old drunk. And Mrs Doyle is every Irish church lady that some of us have known.
I highly recommend this one for anyone who just wants a good laugh.",1062892800,4,911,4.461077844311378
1411170,5,B00005A1SY,"I'm definitely hooked!  I haven't seen such great comedy in ages.  After seeing a few episodes on BBC America, I quickly bought Seasons One and Two.  I've had some Father Ted Festivals at my home, and every single one of my friends are also hooked.  The secret, I think, for its success is that Graham Lineham and Arthur Mathews had the guts to write such a script portraying priests as human beings, with virtues and faults; having their vows to the Almighty restraining them to the point of going nuts.  The cast is wonderful.  It's a shame that Dermot Morgan is gone, but I'm sure he's now happy to know that he finally got the recognition he deserved after many years of struggling while he was alive.  All we need now is a DVD on all Father Ted's bloopers.....that would be GREAT!!...If they ever do, I would be the first to purchase it :-)",1057363200,4,845,4.4480519480519485
1411171,5,B00005A1SY,"Okay I admit I am a sucker for UK comedies and have seen a great many of them.  Father Ted is easily amongst the top.
Like many English series Father Ted spends no time setting up the characters or setting and just gets the ball rolling.  It is a very farsical and surreal comedy at times which might take some getting used to if you are expecting something more straight forward like a US sitcom.
The cast is brilliant and it is too bad Dermot Morgan died at such a young age.  There was at least one more season of Father Ted, before it seem slikely he would have left the series.
The DVD is very barebones and sports no extras like the series 2 and 3 DVD's.  No matter this is a must have and a great way to start enjoying this sharply funny UK comedy.",1054684800,10,755,4.115646258503402

The annoying laughter from a recorded audience annoys me because i watched the series before and thankfully it lacked this ""Amercanized"" element.

If you want to see exquisite timing, take a look at the scene in the episode ""The Passion of St. Tibulus"" when the actor playing Bishop Brennan first arrives. The scene is played out without dialogue, but the tension is hysterical. Highly recommended.",1008806400,2,605,4.663551401869159

And now for the negative side - The DVD contains nothing more than the 6 episodes that make up series 1. There is no commentary, no ""behind the scenes"", no interviews... As if that wasn't enough, there are no subtitles! I live in Greece, and most of my friends have limited knowledge of English and usually have to rely on subtitles to understand everything; as a result, I have a hard time sharing this excellent comedy with them. In addition, the menus are crude and I can only wonder why they did such a poor job on the authoring aspect of this DVD.
