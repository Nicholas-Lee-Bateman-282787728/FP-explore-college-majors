8022703,5,B00026JI00,"I knew Doug Hannon personally and he was the most humble, sweetest, smartest, bass catchingest (I know, it's not a word) guy I've ever known.  All of his books and videos are timeless when it comes to catching largemouth bass.  And his fishing apps are the greatest on the market.  If you use the fishing game and put in all of the scenarios of where you actually go fishing, it will teach you how to be a better angler on your own waters!!!  Great for tournament anglers when fishing new areas they are not familiar with.  The app has a free version, so try it first and then go ahead and purchase the full version - I promise it will be worth it!!!",1433894400,,650,4.252032520325203
8022704,5,B00026JI00,Anything by Doug Hannon is 5 star.  He was a great bass fisherman and teacher as well as an outspoken champion and defender of this great sport.  So sad that he had to die so young and prematurely.,1425945600,,197,4.157894736842105
