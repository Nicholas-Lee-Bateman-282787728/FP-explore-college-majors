1650243,3,B00005QW6A,"The sound was very poor for the Whos on First routine. The rest of the audio is good, there are some great gags on this DVD.",1374192000,,124,3.8076923076923075
1650244,5,B00005QW6A,"The quality is not high.  However, the complete ""Who's on First"" routine is there and is should probably be seen once if you're in American culture.",1356480000,,148,4.6923076923076925
1650245,4,B00005QW6A,"This is perfect for the silly, fun loving family.  It is not even, but worth sitting through for the great scenes",1353801600,,113,4.380952380952381
1650246,2,B00005QW6A,"You really have to be an avid fan to like this DVD, Yes there is some funny routines but the commercials and the singing don;t really cut it for me. I remember seeing the baseball stint when I was young and still get a laugh out of it today.",1299110400,,241,3.938775510204082
1650247,3,B00005QW6A,"amazing to see what 1950's television really was like!!  the quality of the dvd is not up to todays standards, but it is still watchable.  and it was quite the trip not quite down memory lane.",1297036800,,192,4.305555555555555
1650248,3,B00005QW6A,"This was an OK version of the old Abbott and Costello show from many years ago.  The quality of the video was fine, but the show was somewhat disappointing to view.  Of course they were funny,but the other parts were dated and otherwise nothing special.  However, if you like these two comedians, you'll like these short performances.",1296172800,,334,4.824561403508772

1650251,5,B00005QW6A,"I bought many different Abbot and Costello videos trying to aquire"" Who is on First? ""  This is the one. There are other funny routines on this DVD like: Two Tens for a Five. There are acrobats on this show as well that are amazing. It is a must have for all the tresure and laughs you will find on this DVD. A must have for any Drama teacher or any teacher who wants to give the class a good laugh. YOu NEVER get tired of it. It is an American classic. And I found it at last!",1224806400,10,477,3.86734693877551
1650252,1,B00005QW6A,"INCOMPLETE SHOW! The Frankenstein sequence has been edited out!  A whole 10 minutes of the first show is missing!  The old VHS tape is complete.

The second show is complete and fun to watch

The audio also sounds distorted when played directly through my TV speakers.  However, when I play this through my stereo system it sounds fine, you just have to keep the volume turned down to compensate for the high volume level recorded.",1108944000,62,431,4.693333333333333

7950989,1,B00005QW6A,"This DVD was purchased for $00.01, and although it played fine, the image quality and the audio quality leave MUCH to be desired. I also have the same show on another DVD, and it was MUCH better. This only underlines the axiom ""You get what you pay for"".",1425168000,,254,4.3125
