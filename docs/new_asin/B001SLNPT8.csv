8339982,5,B001SLNPT8,"Genius. Completely original, stream of consciousness, forward thinking and perfectly executed. Separately these three people have contributed to some of my favorite comedy of the past 20 years. Together they're unstoppable.

If you don't get it, you don't get it. You're thinking too hard. Relax. Let go. Submit.",1424476800,,312,5.5
8339983,3,B001SLNPT8,"I really enjoyed the show Stella, so I decided to purchase the Live in Boston DVD. Although I did enjoy seeing the guys perform live, I would probably pass on the TV show had this been my first impression of Stella. Some skits seemed to be nothing more than awkward segues into the next. Maybe I'm not hip to all the intricacies of Stella, but as a casual fan of the show, I was left wishing I would have bought a season instead.",1268352000,,429,4.180722891566265
8339984,5,B001SLNPT8,"This was a great DVD! I was lucky enough to go to the show, so when I heard it was DVD I had to grab it at once. This is really Stella at their uncensored finest! The only problem I had was that they cut out my favorite bit they did, but I think it was for copyright reasons on songs they used. Regardless, if you don't know it, you can't miss it, and it's still represented really well with this DVD! The special features also do not disappoint! If you like the Comedy Central show, then you will like this DVD, but if you are familiar with their shorts, then you'll like it even better!",1254441600,,588,4.077586206896552
8339985,4,B001SLNPT8,"Any fan of the now-canceled TV show STELLA (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stella-Season-One/dp/B000FZETJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stella - Season One</a>), or the new show Michael and Michael Have Issues will most likely enjoy this DVD.

Before the TV show, ""STELLA"" was a sort of three-piece stand-up group formed by three members of the comedy troupe ""The State"" (they had a show on MTV in the 90s(&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-State-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00274SITW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The State: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;).

This is what this DVD is, the three of them - Michael Showalter, David Wain, and Michael Ian Black doing their stand-up routine. The act is a little slow getting started, but if you stick with it, it will pay off. I was laughing out loud watching this.

The group's brand of comedy is very hard to define. There is a lot of absurdism and a lot of poking fun at cliches. However you define it, their comedy is unlike anything else out there. You will either really love them or you will hate them. If you keep an open mind the former is more likely.

The extras on this DVD are not the best ever, there are a few episodes of David Wain's online show ""Wainy Days"" and a few episodes of the ""Michael Showalter Showalter,"" while these are both quite humouous, they can also be seen for free online.",1253923200,,1428,5.506849315068493
