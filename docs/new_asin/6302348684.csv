7824463,5,6302348684,"A MUST SEE!  Esp. for all black kids,  and even adults who have been educated in our ""WHITEWASHED HISTORY""  classes.  I am a 59 year old white,  Irish background, from East Texas.  My Mother's Daddy was an ""overseer""  share cropper just north of Shreveport La,  way back in the 30's.  His family worked the cotton fields along with other poor whites and the families of freed slaves.  While he was in a position of ""some"" authority,  he had to ""step & fetch""  when the Bossman demanded.  Slo much of our history has been whitewashed and esp the Black history!!  What got me interested was Glenn Beck, who did some special shows on his Fox program covering a small part of the ""hidden""  BLACK HISTORY.  Along with mentions of books by Edwin Black about the all too real efforts of our ""upper crust"" Elites - who tried to eliminate the Black people,  along with those ""undesirables"" ... poor, un-educated whites.  Their crimes under the ""science""  of EUGENICS in the 1910's all the way thru 1976 knew no color....and was the gameplan to the HOLOCAUST,  when German SS officer Hienrich Himmler discovered America's sterilization and racial laws which was going full on during the early 20th century.  Medger Evers was a HERO.  And almost no one knows about his life!  Teach your children the REAL STORY of America's hidden history!  Not only BLACKS were targeted for extinction,....poor whites - esp the hillbillies - along with the Irish were also enslaved throughout American history,  and targeted for sterilization.  I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT EVEN IN THE 1970's,...HERE IN TEXAS,  6500 AMERICAN INDIAN WOMEN WERE FORCED AND THREATENED INTO STERILIZATION....OF COURSE ""FOR THEIR OWN GOOD!""  So sorry to ramble,  but MEDGER EVERS is an important piece of our nation's hidden history that must be learned and taught,...because it wasn't always ""Americans are the good guys!""  Our Gov't did some horrible things,  to rival those Germans who willingly looked the other way when the Nazis took 33 million people into hell.  Like the German peoples who had to face their past after WW2,  America has YET TO OWN UP TO OUR HIDDEN ""WHITEWASHED""  HISTORY!!  NEVER AGAIN!  THANKS,....DAVE BAKER  LONGVIEW, TEXAS.",1408147200,,2203,4.920765027322404

7824465,4,6302348684,"This is such a great movie before watching Ghosts of Mississippi (1996), I demand that since MGM owns the rights to this movie, they should release it on DVD.  Come on, what are they waiting for, for some strange reason, they have the movie being played on the internet.  Do you see anyone willing to spend a $1.99 to play this movie?",1318118400,7,334,4.370967741935484
7824466,5,6302348684,"For Us the Living, a movie that recently sneaked onto video after airing on national T.V.  The story of Medgar Evers, a civil rights leader from the early to mid sixties who was murdered by the Klu Klux Klan.  This movie tells us first hand how Medgar, took on racist politicians and came home to be a loving husband.  Played beautifully by Holling Rollins, and the gifted Irene Cara.  It is on my shelf right there by Malcolm X.",970099200,18,429,4.3924050632911396
