7392655,5,B014GJBTWI,"Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) lives a simple life with his fellow hobbits in the shire, until the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) arrives and convinces him to join a group of dwarves on a quest to reclaim the kingdom of Erebor. The journey takes Bilbo on a path through treacherous lands swarming with orcs, goblins and other dangers, not the least of which is an encounter with Gollum (Andy Serkis) and a simple gold ring that is tied to the fate of Middle Earth in ways Bilbo cannot even fathom.

Let's discuss what purchasing the Trilogy/ExT Cut will bring you. If you are wondering what scenes the extended edition brings, you should go to the extended versions for each individual movie on Amazon. You can read about them in their review section. Anthony L. has done a great job of listing all of them with great detail. Heres the extended edition running times for each movie:
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey  182 minutes (theatrical: 169 minutes)
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug  186 minutes (theatrical: 161 minutes)
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies  174 minutes (theatrical: 144 minutes)

Prices for each individual Blu-Ray Extended Edition on Amazon
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey  $27.77
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug  $29.99
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, blu-ray version comes out November 17th $22.93
Total for buying the Blu-rays separately = $80.69
So, this set here would be over 20 dollars cheaper than buying all three sets separately. Overall, a good deal and it will come with 3 blu-ray extended editions, 27 hours total of extra footage, interviews, commentaries, and a lot of behind the scenes.",1440633600,662,1652,4.920863309352518

7392657,5,B014GJBTWI,"Along with the Lord of the Rings, this is one of my favorite movies. I enjoyed the added content. It was seamless, just like the added content in the LOTR. The movie doesn't follow the book word for word but it is an excellent adaptation. I think J.R.R Tolkien would have approved of both the Hobbit and the LOTR.",1533340800,,313,4.322033898305085

Like many I was excited to hear of the return to Middle-Earth (the Lord of the Rings astound me to this day). Then I heard thered be not one, not two but three films for the one novel! Overkill. And it shows. The middle chapter is the most exciting, but the first is a colossal bore and the third is one massive battle sequence that flies in the face of what the book represents.

The presentation here though is superb, and all tech specs are flawless.",1531267200,,549,4.228571428571429

The bits chopped out to shorten the movies left them somewhat disjointed to me, but the Extended Edition smoothed out the flow very well.  I enjoyed watching on the ""small screen"" Extended Edition more than the ""big screen"" theatrical versions.

The genius of Tolkein, as the creator of another world is perfectly portrayed by Peter Jackson, the director of these films. These wonderfully awesome movies take you into another world. The perfect escape. If tou haven't seen LOTR, I suggest watching ""The Hobbit"" first, as it is a prelude to LOTR, providing  a better understanding and insight of the latter.",1530057600,,485,4.843373493975903

7392684,1,B014GJBTWI,"So far Unexpected Journey has a nice scratch on disk 2 which caused a slight skip.  And on Desolation of Smaug disk 1 has a nice scratch on outer ring.  Still watching it to see if it skips or not.  The Battle of the Five Armies disk 1 has a bunch of scratches.  All the extra discs in the package also are scuffed here and there to. Their quality control on burning these disks is pretty bad.

I am sending these back as I paid for NEW and not what looks like used with all the scuffs and scratches and also there was NO Ultraviolet coupon code at all.

Got the Replacement set of DvDs today from Amazon and OMG what a joke these are.

First I noticed right from the start the Boxes where different.  These ones are cheaply made from how nice the first Box set was and box had rips on the corners in the cheap paper coverings.

Then I started looking at the Discs themselves.  Again more scratches on a lot of the Discs but when I opened Desolation of Smaug and turned over disc 2 I was disgusted by the sight of more fingerprints then I could count and looks like someone was eating and handling this disc and did not care what they did to it.  I closed it all up and washed my hands in a strong disinfectant and put it all back in the shipping box and filled out another return to Amazon slip.

I am done trying to get a REAL BRAND NEW Box set of these movies through Amazon.  Tired of getting USED and damaged goods.

You might get lucky and get a good set, but FYI there are apparently 2 different Boxes you can get.  One is nice in like imitation leather bindings on the covers and such while this second box I got was cheap paper bound only.  Since I can not trust what I am going to get I will never own this Trilogy.",1528848000,2,1725,4.074183976261128
7392685,1,B014GJBTWI,"The hobbit is bad, like really bad. The book is one of my favorite books ever and even trying to come at it from a 'the book and movie are two different things' mind set does not help. First, there is way too much focus on action. The charm of the hobbit comes from how adventure sucks. The extra scenes they added so they could exploit this property as much as possible are...okay I guess. Radagast is fine. They shoehorn legolas in just to provide fanservice as him being there adds nothing to the plot. Also, CGI everywhere so much that I would be surprised they even had a single physical location. And my biggest pet peeve it tickles when they force a romance subplot in between Fili and added elf character even though there would be no possible reason for this love at first sight they put it in because Hollywood. I could absolutely rant about these movies for hours because they took a beautiful and amazing story about adventure and twisted it into the movie industry's newest turd.",1528588800,,992,4.516666666666667

7392688,4,B014GJBTWI,"We loved this trilogy, though it didn't follow the book nearly as closely as did the LOTR trilogy..",1528243200,,99,4.555555555555555
7392689,2,B014GJBTWI,"I am a big fan of Tolkien's fantasies since I first encountered them in high school.  I loved Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"", though I found the second episode ""Two Towers"" too short in the original edition and the third episode, ""Return of the King,"" too long with material added not in the book or distorted.  So when I decided on a binge weekend with ""The Hobbit"" I didn't know which way this adaptation would go - too much cut, too much added, or just right.

Unfortunately, as soon as I began, I knew I was in for directorial and computer-generated excess.  Thirteen minutes at the opening devoted to a battle which takes only a page of casual reference in the book, full of orcs and dwarves and dismemberment.  Then we get to Bilbo Baggins, (well cast and played) and the dwarves (well cast and well-differentiated) and I heaved a sigh of relief. Back to Tolkien's vision.

But  Jackson could not resist reconstructing Tolkien's tale as a prequel to his version the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (LotR).  The original tale includes a reference to Gandalf's being absent ""on other business"" - Jackson reimagines this as a visit with Galadriel and Saruman, characters from LotR, setting up the conflict with Sauron which will drive the later tale.  The original tale includes an episode involving wood-elves;  Jackson brings in Legolas, the heroic and sexy wood-elf from the LotR trilogy, and gives him a love interest.  There is also a supplementary plot-line involving star-crossed love between an elf-girl and a dwarf.  The last movie of the trilogy, ""The Battle of Five Armies, goes on for two hours, to tell what took only the last 40 pages of Tolkien's 300 page book. Someone should have restrained Peter Jackson.

And there is a computer generated supporting cast of thousands - goblins, orcs, and elves, The sheer number of combatants tipped me past the willing suspension of disbelief needed to hold the fantasy together.  Where had all these folks been hiding?

""The Hobbit"" in book form has its long-winded, skimmable passages, but basically it is a charming story about a young man who finds unsuspected resources within himself.  That story is nearly lost in the multiple plot lines and lavish effects of the movie.",1527724800,,2235,4.842105263157895
7392690,2,B014GJBTWI,"Different colored labels make me wonder if pirated...

Rest of the discolored label discs (one in each set of discs) have a hesitation at one spot, but keep playing.

Came in great shape, nice box set, and I have all digital download codes (though not used yet).

7392695,1,B014GJBTWI,"Tolkien would be horrified and disgusted. The names of the characters and the setting are all that remain of a fascinating and complex story.

The movie cases have the leathery look and feel until you pull them out of the sleeve, at which point your realize they have pictures on the front. The pictures look nice but, again, this doesn't match the LotR set. If you're not OCD about this sort of thing, you'll probably be fine with it.

7392736,4,B014GJBTWI,"The trilogy doesn't quite hold up to the LOTR, but it's still an entertaining journey. My problem with the purchase though, and the reason I knocked this down a star, is because the packaging is sub par. I know for a fact that when this was first released, it had similar sturdy packaging to the LOTR Extended Trilogy boxed set (which was amazing). Apparently at some point they cheapened the packaging; now it's just a flimsy slipcase with flimsy cases for the disks. Kind of a let down, and it ruins the aesthetic when placed next to my LOTR Extended Trilogy boxed set.

The special features are fantastic though. Hours and hours of enjoyment watching how the movies were made.",1520121600,,679,4.658333333333333

Also at some parts in the second movie (the desolation of smaug) it started to pixelate and it completely froze. Honestly I want my money back.",1520121600,2,517,4.51063829787234

7392750,5,B014GJBTWI,"Note: I have not yet viewed the special features.

Minor spoiler included.

After viewing The Lord Of The Rings Extended Versions, I decided to see if The Hobbit Extended Versions would live up to the aforementioned trilogy in terms of excitement and entertainment. In many ways, it does, because this is a prequel that is essentially a long flashback to Bilbo's adventures only slightly alluded to in the latter trilogy, and as a result, there are nods to it that will only make sense if you view The Lord Of The Rings first (not to mention that there are also two bookend scenes, one each, at the beginning of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, and at the end of The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies). But in other ways, since you're probably so familiar with the more famous trilogy, this one might feel like a let-down. But that is all a matter of personal taste.

The first two Extended Versions are rated PG-13, but the third one is rated R for Some Violence during a chase scene on ice and on the main field of battle during the climax. It's not Scarface-level graphic, but for those of you with weak stomachs, you have been cautioned. There is plenty of violence in the trilogy, which aside from what I have mentioned in regards to the third installment, is not graphic, there are a few mild sexual innuendoes, and a few brief profanities during the third installment, and no sexual content (characters in bed, etc) throughout the trilogy.

I highly recommend watching The Lord Of The Rings Extended Versions first, and then watch The Hobbit Extended Versions. It will make for a far richer experience.",1517616000,6,1615,4.656140350877193

7392759,4,B014GJBTWI,"There is a huge amount of supplemental data on the discs.  In reading the Hobbit, I questioned how one could get three full length motion pictures from the book.  And in watching the movies, it is clear things barely mentioned get film time.  A lot of why, where and how are in the supplemental discs.  The appendices for the LOR book trilogy is heavily relied upon.  And in instances where only a fleeting mention is made, but filled out in the movies, especially the extended versions, it does not seem offensive to Tolkien's vision.  There is some repetition in the appendices for each movie, which could indicate each movie and appendices can be stand alone in flavoring the movie.

I feel the extended versions of the movie are superior in many ways to the theatrical versions. Certainly the extended version (Blu-ray) for the first movie was superior to the first Blu-ray version of the movie released, which contained zero extras.

Peter Jackson has given fans of Tolkien six movies, to be enjoyed in order for Middle Earth, and fans would be advised to further check out the Appendices in the LOR book trilogy.",1516924800,2,1118,4.756476683937824

7392767,5,B014GJBTWI,"This might strike people as odd, but I much prefer the Hobbit trilogy to the LOTR trilogy.  Why?  My chief complaint with the LOTR films is that, despite their three-plus hour lengths (and even longer in the extended versions), it still felt like a breeze through Middle Earth.  The sense of journey that one feels in the books was condensed to solely the major plot points.  Gone were the Barrow Downs and Tom Bombadil.  Gone was the sense of respite that the hobbits found at Farmar Maggot's.  Gone were the the snatches of poems and songs.  And for every scene that was expertly done (Moria!), there were others that were awkward (Galadriel turning into a poltergeist?).

So, sure, I was skeptical when Peter Jackson returned to the Tolkien well, with a plan to create three more films for a single slim book that's more of a children's tale than an epic.  And, sure, there are still awkward moments in the Hobbit trilogy: relentless action, an orc villain who is mentioned in a solitary line elevated to a major character in all three films, and Galadriel again turning into a poltergeist!  But here the nine-plus hours actually helps.  At the end of the trilogy one feels as if they've been on a fantastical journey, with Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves all fully alive.  I also like how the Hobbit films bring Middle Earth alive in all its splendor and whimsy.  Yes, purists will criticize this change or that embellishment, but taken as a whole I find the Hobbit much more rewarding than the LOTR.  For the LOTR, I prefer the books, thank you.  For the Hobbit, the books nice as well, but I have a feeling that I'll be returning to middle earth more for the second trilogy than the first.",1516665600,,1695,4.6033333333333335

The only movie that came with a digital copy, for me at least, was The Battle of Five Armies.

My biggest complaint is actually that the product page/description needs updated, because it does not to a great job at describing what you will be getting. Obviously we get the extended edition blurays, but with some people posting reviews including the cool box they got, or all the digital copies, something should be done to the product page to make sure we know what we are getting.

7392814,1,B014GJBTWI,"I was really excited to receive this extended edition trilogy in the mail, but when it arrived I was very bummed. For one, it doesnt come in the nice folding case like my Lord of the Rings edition came. Instead it came in a cheap paper sleeve that doesnt fester any new art or inserts into the Blu-ray cases.

Also, only one of the movies came with a digital copy. Only the 3rd one... What am I supposed to do when Im traveling?? Just never watch the first 2 Hobbits but watch the third?!

One of the cases came broken where it doesnt snap closed on the bottom portion of the case. *sigh*

This is just not what I was expecting whatsoever. Im so confused because the 5 star reviews show people with the gold out case I was expecting and all the 1 star reviews show the paper sleeve case I received. Whats up with that???",1513036800,2,820,4.210191082802548
7392815,1,B014GJBTWI,"I wish I could give this 0 stars. Where do I begin? Here are the issues that I have noticed. Amazon, please put your sh*t together on this one.

1) First off, the Amazon descriptions of the creators of the movies is incorrect. And the descriptions have weird spelling mistakes and isn't as organized as the Lord of the Rings' descriptions.
2) Comes in a really flimsy cheap looking packaging. The Blu-ray cases look really really cheap. The box has weird edges.
3) ONLY THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES HAS THE DIGITAL CODE.
4) The case of the second movie was completely in pieces.
5) This set is NOWHERE CLOSE to the Lord of the Rings box set, which I adore. which I bought a few years ago. I'm sure they are a different manufacturer for this set.
For these reasons, I am going to return my items until Amazon and New Line Cinema gets their sh*t together and comes up with a set the fans will like.",1513036800,8,897,4.3076923076923075

7392828,3,B014GJBTWI,"As other reviews have pointed out, it seems that this item is no longer sold with premium packaging matching the LotR blu-ray set. I'm not sure if this item is simply linked to different reviews, or if the high-quality version is no longer manufactured. If you're looking for the cool, thick-cardboard flipcase pictured in early reviews, this will let you down.

More than simply being basic, however, my cases were all damaged - the spines and clear slipcovers were all cracking, and pieces inside were falling off. I was lucky enough not to have any damaged discs as others have reported (a couple of my discs were hanging by a thread, as some of the tabs holding them in place had broken off), but it's as if the packaging is used or has been repurposed - it's in really bad shape, and other recent reviews would seem to indicate that it's not a fluke - there are many in similarly terrible condition.

That said, the content is all here, and there's a lot of it. The extended films themselves, the new Appendices, and the third bonus disc for each film make for quite a collection of features. If you catch it during a sale (I bought it on Cyber Monday), this set is still worth it - that is, if, like me, you aren't bothered by the low-rent packaging and your discs are all undamaged.

The rest are missing which I find to be kind of a rip off. The plastic part holding the CDs in is broken on the second movie and the CD was moving around the entire time. I am disappointed. Do not order this unless you expect the hardcover case with the map in it for I think it isn't being sold anywhere that I can find.

You can love or hate the movies themselves, but this disc set is exactly what I was looking for as the extended version and came as advertised, contrary to some other reviews.  I don't care much about the bonus discs, I have not even watched them yet.  The packaging is a hybrid slip cover with 3 disc cases inside with 2 discs per case, but the slip cover has an opening outer flap with a map on the inside, that folds over and secures the disc cases inside.

7392896,1,B014GJBTWI,"This 1-star review is written to reflect, from my perspective, the inaccuracy of what this page advertised for the product and the time I spent attempting to rectify this. Although I received the Hobbit Trilogy Extended Edition in Bluray, this did not include the edition that includes the (Ultraviolet) digital HD code that others had mentioned in other reviews. I called to explain customer service about this issue and sent a replacement almost immediately. The customer service person informed me that she would put in a note to the warehouse side to emphasize this issue and the importance to inform the warehouse side to ensure the version would include the digital code.

After seeing an image of the version that specifically states there would be a digital code, I saw that the boxset I received was identical to the first, and can conclude it is not the correct version and does not contain a digital code. It is frustrating that the advertised product is not what I received nor did my attempt to rectify this result in a satisfactory purchase.

In summary, the speed of delivery, customer service, and the spirit of attempting to address this issue have been excellent. Unfortunately, the final product is not what was advertised and I remain a disappointed customer regarding this specific issue.

Amazon needs to modify how their pages display products with different versions. For movies such as this, there appears to be selections for regular Blu-ray, DVD, 3D Blu-Ray, 4K, etc. Yet, for this specific product, there does not appear to be any clear way to select or choose among re-releases or 'updated' editions of the same product.",1502582400,5,1649,4.967391304347826

7392901,5,B014GJBTWI,"I eagerly purchased the extended versions of all the LOTR movies. Those movies were beautiful, but the books were so long that many scenes and characters had to be eliminated. I have greatly enjoyed both the edited commercial versions AND the extended versions. The Hobbit, on the other hand, was a rather short book. I loved the casting and those scenes that followed the novel. However I was in for a major disappointment at the end of the first movie. Where was the scene between Bilbo and Smaug? That was the best scene in the whole book. Instead I had to sit through tons of pointless actions scenes and references to the original trilogy which had nothing to do with the Hobbit book. I felt they could have done one long movie with the actual scenes taken from the book without all the pointless extra action scenes, an added romance I could have done without and all the reference to events that would take place in LOTR. In fact, when I watch the movies now I fast forward through quite a bit. I always watch the beginning of An Unexpected Journey, the scene with the trolls, the scene of the giants fighting and a few others. The Desolation of Smaug has the most watchable scenes. The last movie I don't watch at all since the first time. I'm sorry, it was only a small section at the end of the book and the hours of warfare were just boring. Jackson should have learned from King Kong - keep the parts with heart, lose all the gratuitous scenes with bugs and monsters and icky things. The characters matter most. Commercial greed really ruined the Hobbit for me by forcing into 3 movies a story that should have been told in only one. And it would have been a FANTASTIC movie - Smaug was everything a dragon should be!",1501977600,,1729,4.457413249211356
7392902,4,B014GJBTWI,"In comparison, I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy and have spent more time watching it than a responsible working adult should (""Partying? Yeah, very wicked party this weekend!"" *Pops a Tylenol with her coffee and makes mental note to avoid starting the extended version of LOTR at 3 p.m. Sunday afternoon*)

Despite high hopes and expectations, this version of the Hobbit is uneven. It has great visuals and wonderful expanded story points. Beorn and some of the added backstory on Gandalf were especially well done. It's a pity there wasn't a little more editing. Where the actors were allowed to shine they did, and Smaug will be the definitive image I see when I hear ""dragon"" for the foreseeable future. I don't notice minor editing glitches. I giggled along with everyone else when KIng Thranduil turned his head in perfect unison with his mount and sprouted an impressive pair of antlers. I wouldn't for anything have removed that bit. But some parts of these movies need to go.

The entire trilogy of movies is cheapened by attempts to make the dwarves perform a gross comedy routine. Someone confused The Hobbit with the Three Stooges. These attempts fell flat for those who have read the story. These are the last survivors of an ancient and honorable line on a desperate quest to restore their kingdom. A few jokes, okay, but these dwarves suddenly turn from intrepid adventurers to charmless six year olds who've had too much cake. This jarringly detracted from a work that was otherwise was fantastic.

Please, someone, edit and re-release this! It is such a great trilogy in other ways and really brought the story to life. Judiciously excise (and we'll all agree to quietly forget) bits where Peter Jackson must have left his director's chair to visit the loo and Jim Carrey wandered by. A fine comedian in his realm, but that realm is not in Middle Earth.",1501977600,,1874,4.795665634674923

An Unexpected Journey is very repetitive, consisting of our Hobbit and dwarves being chased by orcs, then escaping, then doing it all over again. Very anticlimactic ending. The Desolation of Smaug is an improvement, but the running time is murderous, so by the time you get to the dragon, you are in serious migraine territory. The worst of the lot is The Battle of the Five Armies, stretched to the max to get as many ticket sales as humanly possible. It's a disjointed, half assed effort. When this Trilogy of Greed concludes, there is no sense of Wonder of achievement like what is experienced during The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Instead, it's just an empty feeling.

7392938,5,B014GJBTWI,"Having thoroughly enjoyed the extended editions of Jackson's earlier trilogy I bought the extended version of the Hobbit with high expectations. Though I found it to be not quite as rich as the earlier it did have some good additions: the opening Shire, Goblin Town, and Rivendell sequences from the first movie were priceless, the additional Mirkwood and Elven kingdom stuff from the second, and the dialogue between Beorn and Gandalf at the outset was so critical I found myself wondering how it could have been deleted from the original. I also found the extended battle sequences from the third movie quite indispensable. All in all, the extended versions are superior to the theatrical even before getting to the gajillion hours of extras.

Being a Tolkien enthusiast I am well pleased with the end result and certainly willing to forgive the plethora of liberties that Jackson takes with the literary work because it usually conveys better to the screen. I imagine he's had enough middle earth to last a lifetime but can only hope he sees the explosive potential of the Silmarillion material to do it again!",1497398400,10,1113,4.951871657754011

7393001,3,B014GJBTWI,"I thought physical media reached its lowest point in tangible quality when every DVD I bought started coming in those eco cases. Blu-ray was supposed to be the collector's format, but now they're shipping The Hobbit trilogy out in these regular cheap-o cardboard boxes. I've owned the hardcover for a little over a year, but this thing is still priced at $70. Come on, Warner Bros, you cheapskates. I guess look to outside sellers to get what you think you're paying for. Don't settle for less.

It was always hard for me to rate this trilogy since it's clearly not Lord of the Rings, but at least Peter Jackson directed it like he still gave a crap. The Star Wars prequel comparisons are unfounded in that regard since those movies outright suck. There might be a lot more green screen in the Hobbit, but the passion is still there. The problem is Jackson shot for the moon with a very small caliber (200 page book = 9 hour saga??), so we're left with this whether we like it or not. There's a three hour masterpiece buried in here somewhere though. Bloated? Very. Boring? Sometimes. But I applaud the effort. An admirable misfire.",1488844800,,1132,4.603960396039604

7393008,4,B014GJBTWI,"Ever since the classic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy ended, fans were clamoring for JRR Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" to be adapted for film as well. After all, ""The Hobbit"" contains the seeds of the sequel trilogy's plot, so it made sense.

But instead of a straightforward adaptation of Bilbo Baggins' adventures, Peter Jackson sets the stage for everything to come -- in addition to Bilbo finding the Ring, it is about the corruption of Middle-Earth as the Dark Lord returns to conquer. There are some notable flaws (a contrived love story) and isn't quite as brilliant as the ""Rings"" trilogy, but the overall effect is a strong, epic story with a sublimely talented cast.

Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures... until the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago, and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. He especially wants the Arkenstone, a jewel that symbolizes kingship of the dwarves. Among their problems: vicious trolls, goblins, giants and an albino orc who literally wants Thorin's head (preferably separated from the rest of him).

But unknown to the dwarves, Bilbo has encountered a grotesque creature known as Gollum (Andy Serkis), and found a golden ring that gives invisibility. He uses this Ring  to survive the attacks by giant spiders of Mirkwood, and later avoid imprisonment by the deadly wood-elf King Thranduil (Lee Pace) and his son Legolas (Orlando Bloom).

But finding the Arkenstone turns out to be perilous when Bilbo accidentally wakes Smaug, who immediately figures out what Bilbo is doing there, and goes on a burn-everything-to-the-ground rampage over the human city of Laketown. The only one who has a chance of stopping him is the archer Bard (Luke Evans) -- but even without Smaug, Thorin's paranoia and growing madness spark off a war between the dwarves, humans and their wood-elf allies.

While all this is going on, the wizard Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something sinister that moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur. Gandalf believes that this may mean that Sauron is returning to his old power, and starts snooping in old mountain graves and the ruins of Dol Guldur. But what he finds is more horrifying than anyone in the White Council expected.

""The Hobbit Trilogy"" is not adapted ONLY from Tolkien's original novel, which is a very linear and simple story. Peter Jackson mined a lot of material from the ""Lord of the Rings'"" appendices, which give background information on Sauron's rise and the way that the White Council attacked him at Dol Guldur. Since Tolkien himself once considered rewriting ""The Hobbit"" to make it more closely tie in to its sequel, it's not that strange an idea.

As a result, the movie feels a bit like a very long three-act tale, with one act forming each movie. And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy, or the sinuous, slithering Smaug filling the stone caverns with fire. Some of the fat could have been trimmed, but most of the stuff here is pretty solid.

The biggest problem? The whole subplot involving Tauriel. Don't get me wrong -- she's a good character and Evangeline Lilly does an excellent job, but the whole idea of her falling in love with resident hot dwarf Kili is painfully cheesy and goopy. Also, the whole character of Alfred. Why is he there?

Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves and earning their respect. It's too bad that he often is sidelined, since he IS the titular hobbit. Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but Jackson shows audiences how much loss, pain and humiliation he has suffered over the years. By the third movie, Thorin is a tragic figure who is crumbling under the weight of his own hubris.

There are many familiar faces -- McKellen, the elegant Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving, a typically acrobatic Bloom as a younger and less experienced Legolas, and the sonorous-voiced Christopher Lee. Benedict Cumberbatch deserves special praise for giving a silken-voiced sadism to Smaug, and there are some amazing performances from Evans as a stalwart, noble man who fiercely loves his family; McCoy as a delightfully scatterbrained wizard who spends all his time with animals; and Pace as a sinuous, elegant elf king with a raw core of pain.

As with ""Lord of the Rings,"" the extended edition is the one to get -- the pieces woven back into the story allow it to flow more smoothly, and fleshes out the characters further (such as Beorn's introduction to the dwarves, or Thorin's worry about mental illness in his family). It also even adds in some subplots that were excised from the theatrical version, such as Gandalf finding an old friend in the heart of Dol Guldur.

It has some flaws like the cheesy love story, but ""The Hobbit Trilogy"" is a strong, majestic prequel to the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, mingling fantasy adventure with a sense of Shakespearean tragedy. Just don't expect direct adaptation.",1488412800,2,5471,4.946623093681917

I could be wrong here, but i previewed the extended cuts online and this one did not make it in my dvd: the scene where Gandalf talks to Thranduil about his wanting the jewels as something connected to his deceased wife yet she left him Legolas which Thranduil should value more, paraphrasing of course.

7393075,5,B014GJBTWI,"Ever since the classic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy ended, fans were clamoring for JRR Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" to be adapted for film as well. After all, ""The Hobbit"" contains the seeds of the sequel trilogy's plot, so it made sense.

But instead of a straightforward adaptation of Bilbo Baggins' adventures, Peter Jackson sets the stage for everything to come -- in addition to Bilbo finding the Ring, it is about the corruption of Middle-Earth as the Dark Lord returns to conquer. There are some notable flaws (a contrived love story) and isn't quite as brilliant as the ""Rings"" trilogy, but the overall effect is a strong, epic story with a sublimely talented cast.

Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures... until the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago, and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. He especially wants the Arkenstone, a jewel that symbolizes kingship of the dwarves. Among their problems: vicious trolls, goblins, giants and an albino orc who literally wants Thorin's head (preferably separated from the rest of him).

But unknown to the dwarves, Bilbo has encountered a grotesque creature known as Gollum (Andy Serkis), and found a golden ring that gives invisibility. He uses this Ring  to survive the attacks by giant spiders of Mirkwood, and later avoid imprisonment by the deadly wood-elf King Thranduil (Lee Pace) and his son Legolas (Orlando Bloom).

But finding the Arkenstone turns out to be perilous when Bilbo accidentally wakes Smaug, who immediately figures out what Bilbo is doing there, and goes on a burn-everything-to-the-ground rampage over the human city of Laketown. The only one who has a chance of stopping him is the archer Bard (Luke Evans) -- but even without Smaug, Thorin's paranoia and growing madness spark off a war between the dwarves, humans and their wood-elf allies.

While all this is going on, the wizard Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something sinister that moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur. Gandalf believes that this may mean that Sauron is returning to his old power, and starts snooping in old mountain graves and the ruins of Dol Guldur. But what he finds is more horrifying than anyone in the White Council expected.

""The Hobbit Trilogy"" is not adapted ONLY from Tolkien's original novel, which is a very linear and simple story. Peter Jackson mined a lot of material from the ""Lord of the Rings'"" appendices, which give background information on Sauron's rise and the way that the White Council attacked him at Dol Guldur. Since Tolkien himself once considered rewriting ""The Hobbit"" to make it more closely tie in to its sequel, it's not that strange an idea.

As a result, the movie feels a bit like a very long three-act tale, with one act forming each movie. And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy, or the sinuous, slithering Smaug filling the stone caverns with fire. Some of the fat could have been trimmed, but most of the stuff here is pretty solid.

The biggest problem? The whole subplot involving Tauriel. Don't get me wrong -- she's a good character and Evangeline Lilly does an excellent job, but the whole idea of her falling in love with resident hot dwarf Kili is painfully cheesy and goopy. Also, the whole character of Alfred. Why is he there?

Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves and earning their respect. It's too bad that he often is sidelined, since he IS the titular hobbit. Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but Jackson shows audiences how much loss, pain and humiliation he has suffered over the years. By the third movie, Thorin is a tragic figure who is crumbling under the weight of his own hubris.

There are many familiar faces -- McKellen, the elegant Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving, a typically acrobatic Bloom as a younger and less experienced Legolas, and the sonorous-voiced Christopher Lee. Benedict Cumberbatch deserves special praise for giving a silken-voiced sadism to Smaug, and there are some amazing performances from Evans as a stalwart, noble man who fiercely loves his family; McCoy as a delightfully scatterbrained wizard who spends all his time with animals; and Pace as a sinuous, elegant elf king with a raw core of pain.

As with ""Lord of the Rings,"" the extended edition is the one to get -- the pieces woven back into the story allow it to flow more smoothly, and fleshes out the characters further (such as Beorn's introduction to the dwarves, or Thorin's worry about mental illness in his family). It also even adds in some subplots that were excised from the theatrical version, such as Gandalf finding an old friend in the heart of Dol Guldur.

It has some flaws like the cheesy love story, but ""The Hobbit Trilogy"" is a strong, majestic prequel to the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, mingling fantasy adventure with a sense of Shakespearean tragedy. Just don't expect direct adaptation.",1483660800,,5471,4.946623093681917

7393168,5,B014GJBTWI,"I'll give it five stars only because I can't give it 4 1/2. There were a couple mistakes I wish were fixed. For example, when the Master of Lake town is talking in the beginning of the third film but his lips aren't moving. And another is how Bilbo could really carry 100# treasure chest under his arm for that long at the end of the third film. Maybe that trip tightened him up. In the theatrical versions I enjoyed the first film and the first half of the second. After that, for me, the trilogy seemed to lack character development, humor and drama, and didn't really make sense, especially the third film. I was very disappointed and thought the whole concept of this trilogy was a flop. I mean, if you're going to try to do it right, then do it right. Don't just tell the story and add special effects, but make it enjoyable - make it a story. That was where I landed after the last movie. I bought the extended version because I hoped the new scenes would fix what I sensed was missing is the second half and they did. The movie makers nailed it. I would give the theatrical trilogy 2 stars but this extended trilogy is the far better ""movie."" The second and third films were far more enjoyable. There were surprising additions and I and laughed a lot more than I had before. There are some great surprises in this extended edition and would highly recommend it. Especially if you like the chariot scenes in the Ben-Hur movies. I just watched both of those last month and thought no chariot scene could beat that. But now...I don't know.

A good adventure and serve as a prequel to The Lords of the Ring trilogy. The story can bit a bit lighter at times, an a bit more colorful that the Lords of the Ring, but I don't have a problem with that. I see it as part of the journey of Bilbo as he get's entangled in this larger than life tale. It was nice to see fan favorites like Legolas find his way into the story. Gollum makes a return, and is very scary yet at time you can no help but feel sorry for him.

Apparently the last movie added more violence. Most of the changes and additions to Tolkien's story I didn't mind too much, but I didn't care much for the changes they made to Radagast the Brown. Somehow I never envisioned bird poop in his hair and beard.

I did like that the dwarfs had more personality and the subtle ties to the Lord of the Rings trilogy of movies. I also like the themes of the loss of innocence and overcoming one's own failings.

The screenwriters, who obviously deemed themselves better able to tell the story than one of the greatest storytellers of all time (Tolkien), created a movie that vaguely resembled Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"". I felt myself getting lost in all of the fabricated story lines and subplots that never took place in real life (as far as Middle Earth is concerned). I found myself at times not even recognizing my beloved story, much like, I imagine, a dear friend or family member that has become a drug addict and one can hardly recognize them. (For example: THORIN SLAYED AZOG YEARS BEFORE! THAT DEED BELONGED TO HIM!) (The comment below corrects my error, Dain, son of Nain does indeed slay Azog. The reason that I left the error in my review, is that it is compelling proof that the false storylines in this movie are a disaster! Since watching, I cannot even keep my dwarfs and orcs straight!)

I understand that with any book to film adaptation there are certain creative liberties that have to be taken. I thought that the Lord of the Rings trilogy did an excellent job, however, the Hobbit fails to reach that same level. I thought that the first half of the trilogy (up until the dwarves escape the wood elves/arrive at lake town) was very well done, but for me that is where it begins to fall apart.

The first half of the trilogy was great, introducing the characters, beginning the quest, building enough, but not peaking so as to leave you disappointed. Britney and Mirkwood were well done, but this is where it all stats to slide downward. The love triangle and the events involved with the dwarves battling Smaug, ruined the second half of the second installment. The third movie begins with a climax that is never attained again. For the first time I wished I hadn't bought a middle earth extended edition with the battle of the five armies. The extended scenes in the battle are comical with poor animation, not what I've come to expect from Peter Jackson's work with Tolkien.

7393277,4,B014GJBTWI,"I really feel that they stretched a two movie book into three movies, so I wasn't sure what I would think about the extended edition of all three movies. I really think it's a mixed bag. I'm trying to make generalizations, but some of this could be spoilers!

I actually like the Unexpected Journey Extended. I think they added quite a few scenes that add to the character development and emotional impact. At the the same time, the battle under the mountain doesn't take itself as seriously--the Great Goblin is much more a fool which makes the impact of the more serious final battle that much more.

As for the Desolution of Smaug, I'm undecided. Most of the added scenes add to the character development, but I don't think it makes a better movie. There are scenes added/changed that fix tension, help characterization, and make Lake-Town feel more like a working world. But, Desolation of Smaug feels like a lot of setup for the last movie. Again, not a bad movie in any way, but it's my least favorite of the three and I don't think the extended edition fixes the whole move's problem.

Then as far as The Battle of the Five Armies goes, I just think the extended edition is unnecessary. It steps up the violence and the extended edition is rated R. There are a few additions that aren't battle, but majority is battle that adds to the violence without necessarily improving the battles. The battles are huge action setups against a one dimensional enemy and the extensions don't fix any problems or in my mind make the battles better--and it's a version that I won't watch with my teenage nephew because of the rating.

If you there's a good sale, the extended three pack can be about the price as buying two of the extended movies separately. I only think the Unexpected Journey is a must buy for the extended edition. At least the extended Desolution of Smaug does give you an extended view of the characters.

I have always liked the behind the scenes extras.  These are not the same quality as those done for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but then neither were these three movies.  Perhaps I just found the first movie's approach too close to that of the author's: the Hobbit is a child's book with childish humor--so for example the fight with the Goblin's is somewhat Looneytoon like.  However the next two movies were not so.  A nice balance of action, humor and concern (and the extended battle in the third is great fun!)  I would have left the love story out (as Tolkien did), but in all six movies the directors wanted an expanded role for women--I assume to increase the audience.  Don't get me wrong--I really enjoy these movies and have watched them multiple times.

7393301,5,B014GJBTWI,"This is a wonderful DVD collection of the Hobbit trilogy. I gave this as a gift to my Mom, who is a huge fan of Tolkien's world of Middle Earth (whom I've taken after), and it was very well received (she has the Extended Edition DVD box collection for the Lord of the Rings and was anxiously waiting for the Hobbit's equivalent). Lots of discs: there's about 5 discs for each movie (the first two are the extended edition of the movie, and the other discs are bonus features). It has been a delight to watch all three movies with their additional scenes (some humorous, and some with new characters), not shown in theaters. And we are equally enjoying watching every bonus feature. Your appreciation for the incredible dedication and thought that the entire cast and crew has channeled into these movies, will reach new heights as you watch the bonus features.
The Hobbit Extended Edition DVD boxset comes with each of the three movies in their own boxed cases with the discs inside. I like the covers for each movie (they're different than the covers of the other Hobbit movie editions: they're poster-like images of scenes from the films) and inside the fold-out cases are illustrations from Alan Lee and John Howe. The discs are a little odd to take out, because on two of the ""folds,"" one disc is overlapping over another, so you have to carefully pop and slide the one on the bottom out carefully, or take out both to get to the one you want. Other than that, the discs are pretty much safely secured. I'm still debating on whether to get this pretty Extended DVD edition, or the Blu-Ray Extended Edition (which will probably be a little slimmer to fit on one's DVD book shelf).

7393305,3,B014GJBTWI,"They're are those who argue for and against this trilogy as being better or worse than the first lord of the ring trilogy. it's certainly easier to appreciate and digest the directors vision than getting through the actual book at times. Although I love a good book, the novel can be a real challange to get through. In order for the movie studios to get the most bang for their buck, it was neccesitated that the singular ""Hobbit"" novel be vastly stretched with added plots that didn't originally exist, to make a threequal movie experience. Now some would call this sacrilege and cry foul that the studios would have the cojones to mess with the writers content, but I am able to appreciate the movie vision on its own merits without having to bash it for lack of staying 100% accruate to the novels. Any screenplay writer knows that when a book is adapted to a movie, many changes are necessary given the fact that most novels do not translate well word for word to the big screen. ITunes sells this for $49.99.  Sure you get the neato box and artwork with this Blu Ray release, but who really fawns over their box set on a regular basis like people used to do with album covers. Downloading files is killing off physical sales of blu ray due to lower price points and the lack of need to store the physical package.

A large proportion of the film is over-taken with elf-orc fight scenes: two elves that aren't even in the book manage to heroically slaughter hundreds of orcs in scenes that aren't in the book.

The ridiculous 'not in the book' love interest between the female not-in-book elf and dwarf culminates in her healing him from a wound that didn't happen in the book, which separates him from the others (again, not in book) using magical powers that it is really unlikely she would have even if she did exist as only a tiny number of elves have that power.

Then at the end, in more 'not from the book' drama, it would seem that hiding behind a sliver of stone will shield people completely from nearby dragon-fire. DRAGON FIRE which apparently doesn't get you if you turn the corner or jump off the cliff in the nick of time.

This lies at the heart of what is wrong with this film, it is trying to turn the Hobbit into an action movie complete with totally unbelievable escapes from danger. This is (theoretically) based on a children's book, it should be more Narnia and less LOTR. Just because they are in the same world should not make this a prequel to LOTR.

Also, all of this inserted stuff really grates and is mostly boring as it has no substance. I don't believe films have to slavishly follow the book but any changes should be justified and these most definitely are not.

Finally, the new bits are given precedence over the actual story and original content. How can they turn a single book into three films and yet cut-down or skip or rush through loads of really good bits from the book? How can they expand the fake characters at length and yet the real characters are barely used? Only a couple of the dwarfs are even distinguishable from each other.

No real attempt has been made to dramatise or flesh out the Hobbit book at all. This is a completely different film. And not even a good one.",1459555200,8,1913,4.4798850574712645

This is a truly great story, but unfortunately it seems to have quite a few continuity errors, and some parts seemed skimpy on detail as if rushed.
The extras make this trilogy truly worth the price (although I would have bought it without them as a true Tolkien fan). I really enjoy having these on disc as it gives me the ability to pause (and just drool over Thorin) .. ahem... and see details I might miss otherwise.

7393442,3,B014GJBTWI,"I primarily rate this downward due to the subpar packaging.

With this version (rather than purchasing the extended editions individually), the only benefit is a discount in price.  For this discount, you lose the appealing packaging of the individual extended editions.

The pack opens with a magnetic flap, including the classic hobbit map.  Individual DVD cases are very simple (no new artwork, just a simple plastic case).  The disc content is the same as that purchased as part of the extended edition.

Ultimately, I'm disappointed that I purchased this instead of the extended editions individually.  I would have preferred the decorative digi-packs to display alongside my Lord of the Rings extended editions rather than this.

Regarding the extended scenes, I like them.  Other reviewers provide significant explanation of the extended scenes content already.  My two cents:  Those scenes that are extended do provide a good deal more flavor of the world.  They attempt to bridge the story of the hobbit to the Lord of the Rings.  The downside is that this at times results in continuity issues since LOTR was made first (Gandalf is somehow surprised in LOTR that Sauron is returning, despite seeing during an extended scene in ""Desolation of Smaug"" that Sauron is obviously active?  Gimli is surprised in LOTR that Moria is overrun with orcs, despite how many scenes showing Azog and his band in control of Moria?). Still, these complaints are not enough in my opinion to change my opinion of the extended editions overall.  I feel that as a fan I am very happy to have the extended editions (only upset of course to not have the fancy packaging).",1456617600,,1657,4.9963503649635035

The case and set are beautiful, just like the Lord of the Rings edition and both sets look amazing next to each other. I do have a gripe: the theatrical versions of the films are NOT included. Also, the set I received has one huge flaw: there appears to be a defect in the artwork of An Unexpected Journey. The Blu-ray cover has been printed with a blurry, low-resolution quality. The other two films in comparison have great shelf appeal, but the overall set is marred by the cheap look of the first. It all fits nicely into a gorgeous box, so the flaw never has to be seen. Still, I know it's there and it bothers me that such an expensive set would be produced so lazily.

7393498,5,B014GJBTWI,"Standard for all my reviews: When reviewing products, I always remain objective and honest about the product or service. I always review with information that I feel others would like to know about the product as I always assume what I'm writing will influence for or against the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application. Most importantly, I will always end the review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items, just let me know!

I've been patient and waited for the set to come out on Blu-ray AND extended addition.  We've already watched them and love them still.  I always try to be objective but I'm a huge fan of both LoTR and the Hobbit and there's just no way I can give them less than 5 stars.  Heck, I'm even going to New Zealand this year and will be touring the Shire.  The extended scenes are great and I'm surprised to find that Thrain (father of Thorin Oakenshield) was removed entirely from the theatrical release of the Desolation of Smaug.  It was nice to see some of that.  In any event, if you're a fan, you'll love this set and the price is great!",1454284800,,1278,4.530434782608696

I did't even go to see the Hobbit series when it was released just because I hate waiting a year between releases .  So getting the set and being able to enjoy it within a few days of each other was a real plus.  First class casting, directing, location, CGI and acting are what really sets these movies apart from the norm.  Plus... being a real fan of Tolkien and the Hobbit since the late 60's when every college kid I knew was reading the book really made it complete with the excellence of this trilogy.  Great way to finally see it all come around and completed after 45 years!

I read a lot of comments from people who say that Peter did a disservice to the books by dragging out the story to 3 separate movies, but I find that more is better and from someone who has a good understanding of the stories, but has not read the books, this is just a thrillingly fun adventure to get lost in.

Getting to know the dwarves behind the scenes adds so much to their interpretation of the characters.  As with the LOTR series, Weta Workshop is unparalleled in their dedication to creating Tolkien's world.  From set design/construction, to costume design, to concept art, to actor/actress selection and relationships, this set takes you into the lives of the cast and crew for the years of production and often ties it together with the LOTR production.  For some, these productions encompassed over 13 years of their lives and the camaraderie that developed and the love and appreciation of Tolkien that was demonstrated is really heart warming.  We watched the 3movies and now, having just about completed the appendices, we will go back and watch them again with additional awareness of the back stories.

When I saw these movies in the theaters I felt like there was a lot missing that would be filled by the extended editions. I was not disappointed.

For those who aren't fans of this series or keep comparing it to LOTR. Stop. It is supposed to be slow paced and not on as grand a scale as LOTR. Enjoy it for what it is and you too will be entertained for a bit over 9 hours.

Picture quality and sound is as it should be. Crisp, clear and detailed. I haven't seen the bonus features yet but I would imagine they would add to those 9 hours.

7393562,4,B014GJBTWI,"I'm a Tolkien fan, so I'm biased in favor of anything that illuminates Middle-earth. I've read everything from ""The Children of Hurin"" to ""The Silmarillion,"" so I'm familiar with the departures Peter Jackson made in telling this story. For example, the ascendancy of Radagast the Brown from a briefly-mentioned maia to a guano-encrusted, mushroom abuser is of no merit, as is Azog's large role and the expansion of Dol Goldur and the set pieces taking place there. Though the movies tell Bilibo's story, the delightful fun of Tolkien's book (which was aimed at children, after all) has been completely lost amid the movie's hundreds of decapitations. Sad, because I'm sure that is NOT what Tolkien would have wished. In a perfect world, Jackson should have made ""The Hobbit"" first (as he intended), two movies at most, keeping it light and fun, with the dwarves as comic relief, after which, he could have made the darker and scary ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Oh well.",1452556800,15,969,4.914634146341464
7393563,3,B014GJBTWI,"the movies are awesome, so they get a 5. But I bought the region-free 3d extended trilogy (with blu ray discs and feature discs) from amazon.uk for $60.00 US with shipping ( which was pretty fast) . For $30.00, I can wait a day or 2 more. The three stars is for the boxes -.the outer box has a paper advertiser glued to it - be very careful when you take this off - I got a small tear (on the front, of course) from the glue not letting go easily - even though it is the kind that usually rolls off. There are three cases inside the outer box and this is where the three stars comes in - the cases are not built  to protect the discs, especially the first two discs in each case which are the 3d ones. The plastic disc holder of the first disc slides in under the second disc which is the second half of the movie and I can see trouble coming there. The cases themselves are a flimsier plastic and it takes some fiddling with them to get them to close. It's a shame to throw this box and cases and I haven't - yet. But I moved the 3d movies into a real blu-ray case (you can buy these empty on amazon) that holds 6 discs carefully with no scratching. I have the original extended editions in blu ray, so I don't know what I'm going to do with the rest of this mess. Probably bite the bullet and give the other discs away. I wouldn't even put other discs in my collection in these cases. But if I had paid $90 to $150 for it I would have sent it back.",1452384000,,1450,3.9657534246575343

7393583,4,B014GJBTWI,"Great films. Fun Extra features.
To clear up some confusion about the extra features, the Appendices in the Hobbit Trilogy are labeled as 7-12. This is because Appendices 1-6 are part of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. (took me a bit to figure this out. Also, Peter Jackson explains this in the introduction of the Appendices).
There are 2 Appendices discs per film in this trilogy for a total of 6 discs of the Appendices and 3 discs for the films. (I'm discussing the Blu-Ray)
Here's why I only gave it 4 stars:
1) One of the clips holding the discs broke. Each sleeve holds 3 discs (one sleeve for each film). There is a sort of plastic ""page"" that holds two of the discs. The little tab that holds this ""page"" broke on me on the first day.

2) Price is higher on Amazon than it was at Costco (and fluctuated greatly from just before Thanksgiving to New Years)
3) Unlike LOTR's Extended editions, this does not have any booklet with maps of the journey or outlines of what is in each appendices. It was enjoyable to look at the artwork and organization of the LOTRs Extended Editions.

4) Peter Jackson's treatment of some of the action sequences start to defy physics (escape from Goblin's Realm in Unexpected Journey, In ""Desolation"": Barrel escape from Elves and the Dwarves careening in the mine in the mountain and the giant gold dwarf were excessive and somewhat unbelievable according to physics.) I also found Battle of 5 Armies to be over done and too drawn out. I also didn't like the love story between Fili and the she-elf.

5) Missing opportunities from the Book to make the movie more interesting:
- Introducing the Dwarves to Beorn
- Bilbo's taunting of the Spiders in Mirkwood
-Bilbo and Smaug's first exchange of riddles and quips.

These were great scenes in the book and were very interesting. I was disappointed to see much of these parts omitted in favor of an over done and forced love story between Fili and the she-elf.",1451260800,2,1945,4.580459770114943

7393617,4,B014GJBTWI,"UPDATE 1/20/16: Apologies for the delayed response to some of your questions about contacting Warner Bros. I contacted them via [..] The person who assisted me had 'Flixster Customer Care for UltraViolet' [...] in her signature, but the emails can from the Warner Bros email address. Hope this helps!

====================================

UPDATE 12/04/15: Contacted Warner Bros. Customer Service and everything has been resolved! The Warner Bros. customer service agent was absolutely phenomenal. Honestly, I was shocked to get a response; shocked the response wasn't a canned response; and pleasantly surprised to be dealing with someone empowered to resolve the matter to my satisfaction. The Warner Bros. Customer Service agent exceeded my expectations. She was responsive, patient, empathetic, and diligent in making sure my Digital SD versions of the movie were replaced with Digital HD Extended Edition versions. The agent contacted Flixster and VUDU to ensure that I would get the HD versions of the movie, and even said they were investigating the matter to ensure it doesn't happen to other customers. I was even given a complimentary Digital HD movie from a choice of several recent releases! What's even more awesome is that I can now view the Trilogy movies in glorious HD/HDX as I originally expected. Warner Bros., thank you so much for taking care of this issue so quickly!

====================================================================================================
Previous review 11/28/15
If one of the reasons you're buying this is for the digital HD copy, beware. The included code is only for SD, not the 'Digital HD' emblazoned across the top. This is clearly false advertising! Do not buy until Warner Bros. gets this very poor marketing tactic resolved, and provides what they're advertising.",1448668800,4,1826,5.584837545126354

7393619,4,B014GJBTWI,"While not QUITE as good as the LOTR movies, I greatly enjoyed The Hobbit, and pre-ordered the BR Extended Edition set as soon as I found out orders were being taken.

The set came in a slipcase with wraparound cover, which has a map of Middle Earth printed on the inside.  Each movie came in its own individual BR disc case, a touch I appreciated for protection of the discs (though it does take up a little more room).

So far, my only disappointment has been that the Vudu/Ultraviolet code for the trilogy, which did come in the packaging, redeemed for only an SD version of the films, and not an HD as was advertised.  I will be contacting Warner Brothers Home Video and asking for the HD code I was supposed to get, and will edit this review to reflect their response.",1448582400,22,772,4.3776223776223775

All that aside, this set leaves nothing to be desired. Hours and hours of special features, commentaries, etc. and the packaging is great, and looks quite nice sitting next to the Lord of the Rings Motion Picture Trilogy Extended Edition.

7393624,5,B014GJBTWI,"I'm not going to repeat what others have already added.  I would like to say that, no this isn't the Lord of the Rings.  It's not supposed to be.  When accepted on it's own, the viewer will be rewarded with a wonderful way to spend an afternoon (or day?).  Those who are complaining about ""this isn't in the book"" are missing the fact that the movie is a BETTER story than the book. (heresy, I know).  If the book had been filmed as is, this would have been one of the worst fantasy movies ever.  (please don't get me started...)  Please note, I DO like book. I would also like to add that there is NOTHING in any of these films that didn't come from Prof. Tolkien or are not true to Prof. Tolkien's intent

As for the Silmarillion...this might be beyond even Peter Jackson and company.  A great deal of the Silmarillon could very well become (several) films that are an epic BORE.  However...The stories of Beren and Luthian and the Fall of Numenor, may possible make great additions to the series.  These two stories are so completely tied to the LOTR.  After all, Elrond, Aragorn, and Arwen are all direct descendants of Beren and Luthian.  (and for that matter the Witch King).  Also Numenor is the story of Elrond's twin brother, Eros, of whom the Witch King and Aragorn are his only surviving descendants.

7393627,4,B014GJBTWI,"My only gripe is that the digital HD copy. I believe the studio should offer a choice of Ultra-Violet, VUDU, or iTunes. The premise of the digital copy is to protect the property from being ripped, to enable the consumer to use multiple devices to watch their purchase, and to preserve the consumer's purchase electronically. Buy using their own proprietary Ultra-Violet, I'm locked into their app, their terms, etc. Does anybody know how I can rip my own copy to use on my OWN device?",1448150400,4,485,4.7176470588235295
7393628,1,B014GJBTWI,"The boxed set advertised a digital  copy. When I received it it is limited to a Flixter account. Most of my movies that come with a free digital copy allow you to access it from iTunes. I have an iPhone and want to be able to access my digital copies in the movies app the same way I can all the rest of my movies. To me, having to use a separate account with some non-user friendly method makes the digital copy a complete waste.

The movies are fantastic and I love the way this boxed set matches my Lord of the Rings set.

One of the plastic cases was broken so the disc flops around inside the case.",1448150400,8,603,4.050420168067227
7393629,5,B014GJBTWI,"Great trilogy box set!  The individual boxes are top notch, like a hardcover book.

This was definitely worth the wait!",1448064000,2,278,4.52

Tolkiens books are timeless classics and as to these movies, Peter Jackson accomplished what was once thought to be impossible. But consumers need something to complain about so there was the fuss over The Hobbit being three films. Many of those same people are likely lining up for this extended edition. Go figure?

Learning my lesson with the LOTR films I held off on purchasing the first DVD releases. I figured that they would rererelease them into extended editions and this collection is a wonderful keepsake. Each film is beautifully bundled up separately then the three go into another card stock sleeve. The packaging offers the following product description;

Be careful, don't buy bluray it's a scam!

Love the songs as well as the wonderful Dwarf military inventions in the battle. Awesome.

I found that on each movie, the extended parts should of been included in the original releases as they only add to the wonderful movie. I can watch this over and over and over and.....
