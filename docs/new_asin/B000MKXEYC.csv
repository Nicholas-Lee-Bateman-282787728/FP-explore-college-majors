2736516,4,B000MKXEYC,"When I bought this DVD I was confused about what it actually was. Was it footage of entire games? Was it clips? How were each of the series presented? It turned out that the DVD included three short films, between 20-40 minutes, each where the MLB took you on a fast-track through the different series'.

On the one hand I was disappointed that the coverage of each of the series wasn't more substantial, and that there wasn't additional material included in the DVD. As far as I can tell the MLB reached into their vault, slapped a quick DVD together, and then sold it. On the other hand the three films show a lot of great footage that isn't easily found anywhere but on a platform like this. The footage from the series in 45' was particularly special as I hadn't seen prolonged baseball from that long ago, before.

On the whole, if you're a die-hard Tigers fan this DVD is something you don't want to miss for the price, and it would make a great gift for the die-hards in your life.",1394841600,6,988,4.39344262295082
2736517,5,B000MKXEYC,Good to see the Tigers during their glory days.  So close these days but oh so far.  Love this and if you are a Detroit Tigers fan so will youl,1390608000,,143,3.7333333333333334
2736518,4,B000MKXEYC,"This was great to relive the fantastic '68 World Series and to learn about the '45 World Series. The films were great. However, the video from the '84 World Series had a number of flaws. But, absolutely worthwhile for any true Detroit Tigers fan. Now, if they can live up to the promise of '13 and win it all again, Tiger fans could truly celebrate, since we're obviously over due a World Series Championship!",1373241600,,409,4.54054054054054
2736519,5,B000MKXEYC,"Provides great memories for not only Tiger fans, but baseball nostalgists in general.

 I especially enjoyed the '68 & '84 highlights, especially since the latter was the second that I ever saw. ('83 was the first.)

A decently-priced item, with fast delivery climaxing the purchasing experience.

2736520,5,B000MKXEYC,A must for the sports historian types. These appear to be period pieces that give a contemporary view. It is interesting though that they glossed over the 1968 rain delay inning where players on the bases were willing to get tagged out by reluctant players on the field. It is understandable why it was not focused upon being a period production and the league steering clear of any embarrassing moments of the game.,1244246400,2,416,4.712328767123288
2736521,5,B000MKXEYC,"My favorite time of baseball, 1968 the year of the pitcher.  Here are two fantastic teams with unreal pitchers (McClain & Gibson..oh yea and Lolich).  What a great set of highlights of the Tigers glory years.  The old 1945 stuff is real cool and the 1984 series is much more clear in my memory and well worth the watch.  But that 1968 series is by far the main highlight on this set.  If you are a Tigers fan or just baseball (when it was legit) then pick up this one and some of these other vintage World series DVD.  I loved watching this DVD.",1234742400,3,545,4.1923076923076925
2736522,3,B000MKXEYC,"It's never a good thing when you put a DVD into the player and the first thing that pops up on the TV screen is a disclaimer that states that all audio and video glitches contained herein were present on the master tapes from which the presentation was transferred.  Specifically, in this case, the disclaimer refers to the 1984 World Series highlights, which have been available on VHS for years sans glitches (at least the copy in my garage isn't this beat up).  Obviously, one has to wonder what else is going on the Major League Baseball's video vault if the ""master"" tapes are allowed to deteriorate this badly, but would it really have been that difficult for A & E to fix these errors?

Also--it would be awesome to see the entire 1984 series released on DVD after all these years, but what are the odds of any non-seven game, non-New York series ever seeing the light of day in this manner?  Maybe I shouldn't complain--at least this half-baked effort is out there when we have yet to see so much as a highlight DVD of the 1997 Cleveland-Florida World Series.

Worth owning if you're a Tiger fan, but nothing new.",1198800000,19,1121,4.52970297029703
2736523,3,B000MKXEYC,"As a lifelong tigers fan, i sat down to play this dvd with high hopes. i had the 1968 and 1984 highlight films on vhs, ordered from MLB several years ago. Somehow, they flubbed on the transfer. At several points during the films, the audio drops out and the video jumps -- who watched this in the editing room and approved the final print? It is very disconcerting to watch this. If you are a Tiger fan, you'll likely suffer this to watch your heroes win again, but wince during the key moments that are dropped from the audio track. They need to re-issue a clean version and i need to get a refund.",1183420800,31,599,4.2631578947368425
