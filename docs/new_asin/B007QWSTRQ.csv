5105018,2,B007QWSTRQ,"This is just a 12 minute featurette, the kind of thing normally found as an extra bonus on a movie DVD.  There's no plot; it's just one encounter with a big mean robot.  Although it's good, with lots of action and great music, it's just too short to be sold individually as a ""movie"".

Buy the Megamind/Megamind Button of Doom 2-disc set for a couple of bucks more and you'll be a lot happier.",1365206400,,393,4.283783783783784
5105019,1,B007QWSTRQ,"My son loves the original Megamind so I purchased this in addition to the original as a gift however he did not like it at all! It does not compare to the original in content, creativity or craft.",1365120000,,196,4.184210526315789
5105020,4,B007QWSTRQ,This short film isn't as funny as the regular Megamind movie but it is still good. This movie is only 15 minutes long but it was worth it because my family loves Megamind!,1359072000,,171,4.212121212121212
5105021,5,B007QWSTRQ,This is a cute addition for anyone that enjoys megamind. It is only 15 minutes long but has some extra features which are cute however I would not pay full price for this item.,1355702400,,176,4.205882352941177
5105022,4,B007QWSTRQ,just as stated above. Definitely not worth watching if you haven't seen the original movies.  Funny but only 20 min each,1355184000,,120,4.714285714285714
5105023,4,B007QWSTRQ,"Originally distributed as bonus content for the MEGAMIND DVD, MEGAMIND: THE BUTTON OF DOOM takes place shortly after the events of MEGAMIND. Now that he's a hero and the defender of Metro City, Megamind is having a fire sale to get rid of all his evil gadgets. In one particular funny scene he sells a dehydration gun to a child. After the sale, Minion reveals that the only thing they couldn't sell was a seemingly harmless little button. Megamind has created so many evil inventions over the years that he has no idea what the button is for. So, he presses it. It unleashes a gigantic robot, the Mega-Megamind. Mega-Megamind is a giant robot taller than a skyscraper that not only has all kinds of destructive abilities, e.g. lasers, but the robot has the copied intelligence of Megamind himself. So, as the new hero of Metro City, Megamind's first real battle is fighting a gigantic robotic clone of himself.

Fans of MEGAMIND will enjoy this short. I particular like the rapport between Megamind and Minion and it was fun to see them in another, albeit extremely short, adventure together.",1332806400,5,1093,4.783068783068783
5105024,5,B007QWSTRQ,"Absolutely love Megamind and loved this short. It's only about 13 minutes long, but if you loved Megamind, it's definitely worth it to see this. I wish Dreamworks would make more Megamind shorts. I'm not sure I want a true sequel, because I don't want anything that was resolved in the first movie messed up, but keep these shorts coming!",1321142400,7,338,4.65

8521104,2,B007QWSTRQ,Very disappointing. This was advertised as a mega-adventure. It is only a mini adventure. My son was excited to receive as he loved the first video. Paying this amount for such a short film was disappointing. It should be clearly advertised as a short.,1488153600,,252,4.75
