1814962,5,B00007J5VP,"BIRTH OF THE BLUES (1946) is a somewhat skewed but nonetheless well-intentioned retelling of the history of jazz. Bing Crosby and Jack Teagarden lead the Basin Street Hot Shots, the (fictional) first all-white jazz band in New Orleans. Implicit in the plotline is the idea that it took an all-white band to really make jazz find a mainstream audience... Goofy and slow in parts, a bit stilted, but good clean fun, with Bing still looking pretty young. Lots of weird racial stuff -- buck-and-wing dancing, eye rolling and the like... Still, there are some great performances and it's worth it all just to hear Mary Martin say, ""I want to learn to sing like the colored folk."" Yikes.
In BLUE SKIES (1946), Bing sings and Fred treads in this sketchily-plotted musical, which pits Astaire and Crosby against one another, rivals for the hand of the blonde, domestically-minded Joan Caulfield. This frothy postwar frolic has a wild Techncolor exuberance, with crazy explosions all over the pastel-lined spectrum (and an odd tilt towards purple). The sad thing, though, is that this isn't a very good movie -- the plot is razor thin, barely a hint of an excuse to stage a bunch of great (and lesser) Irving Berlin tunes. Some numbers fall flat (and Billy DeWolfe's interminable, painfully unfunny drag routine brings the movie to a screeching halt)... Still, Fred Astaire's killer performance on ""Puttin' On The Ritz"" is the stuff that legends are made of: as he's angelically hoofing his heart out, a curtain parts behind him, revealing a phalanx of distant, miniature Astaires, keeping time with the big guy. A technical and aesthetic triumph! This flick might be worth it for that routine alone, although Bing gets in some choice vocal performances as well. A dud scriptwise, but it still has two of the greatest performers of the 20th Century, both still at their peak.",1039737600,44,1866,4.926984126984127

He plays a partner with Bing Crosby, and they open verious types of restaurants--all funny stuff, BUT there is a comedy routine that Billy deWolfe does as part of the floor show at a restaurant.
He is Mrs. Murgatroyd --I may be wrong--I will double chefck when I get the DVD. He is dressed in a flowery hat and has a purse and carrying a grocery bag.  It is her anniversary, and she is going to celebrate with aScotch. She finds a friend also at the coctail lounge, and starts talking.
---It is brilliant!--  We watched it sometimes just for that routine  I must have it.

I chose this over Holiday Inn-- I love them both--but --- must have Billy deWolfe.
On Holiday Inn we watched it mainly for Bing's number White Chrisitmas at the piano, with the bells hanging on the Christmas tree.

For real Holiday DVD's I ordered White Christmas, and Miracle on 34th Street -colorized.  Yes. Must have those two.

Of the two I prefer 'Birth of the Blues' which is not even trying to be a documentary. It does set out clearly that Blues and Jazz began with African Americans and that paler skinned types came late to it and took some grief when they played it. Plenty of stereotyping though none of it is (deliberately) nasty. Every really nasty character is white. Whatever the confused racial issues in the movie what I like is hearing Bing sing the blues and he can sure sing them as good as anyone I know. Don't believe me? Louie Armstrong knew it. A shame he didn't do more of Dixieland Jazz or Blues on record. Though there is plenty of recorded examples to be found with a bit of effort. His album with Satchmo is one of my favorites. Very entertaining movie.

This was the second movie to feature Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby together, the first being Holiday Inn. It was in full colour from 1946 and was little more than a vehicle for a couple of dozen songs by Irving Berlin, many still popular today like the title song, `A pretty girl is like a melody', `How deep is the ocean', `You keep coming back like a song', and `Heat wave'. But there are several less well-known tunes here too. Best moments: Astaire's seemingly effortless dancing in `Putting on the Ritz', and the comedy duo number `A couple of song and dance men' - Crosby and Astaire of course. If you like Berlin's music, you'll like this.

Birth of the Blues
I guess this is a documentary of sorts about the introduction of Dixieland Jazz music, originally the province of the black slaves, to the white folks; but it's presented as an entertaining black-and-white musical. It stars Bing Crosby, Mary Martin and Brian Donlevy and dates from 1941. Crosby plays an itinerant clarinettist (Jeff Lambert) who finds himself in New Orleans. He's partnered by cornetist Memphis (Donlevy), trombonist Jack Teagarden (in person) and singer Betty Lou Cobb (Martin) and together they form a Dixieland jazz group. The tunes are of their time, circa World War I. They include `By the light of the silvery moon', `Tiger rag', `Cuddle up a little closer', `Melancholy baby' and of course `Birth of the blues'. The movie also introduced Johnny Mercer's `The waiter and the porter and the upstairs maid', which became a big hit for him and Crosby. There's a passionate rendering of the St. Louis Blues composed by W.C. Handy. The movie was directed by Victor Scherzinger who composed a few hit tunes himself - like 'I remember you', 'Sand in my shoes' and 'Tangerine'. Sadly, he died shortly after the film was released.",1343606400,,1821,4.7993630573248405

1815142,3,B00007J5VP,"Here are 2 Paramount studio films of the turgid Bing Crosby, very popular in their day but pretty hard to take nowadays. Here are some of the problems:

- ""Birth of the Blues"" is an embarassing distortion of history which may have one of the most offensive screenplays ever written;
- Brian Donlevy has a major role in ""Birth"" and would rank as the one of the least suited stars to the musical genre in the history of film. He is completely charmless;
- ""Blue Skies"" pairs Crosby with Fred Astaire and 2 dull leading ladies. The budget for the 2 men meant there was no money for decent female costars. Olga San Juan!!! Olga who? She is awful and Joan Caulfield is colourless. Then there is Billy de Wolfe who is beyond description;
- Astaire himself is pallid and announced his retirement after the film was released, although he subsequently moved to MGM and the Arthur Freed unit.

On a positive note:

- both films are very well made;
- there are some good numbers - ""The Waiter, the Porter and the Upstairs Maid"" in ""Birth of the Blues"" and Astaire's showstopping ""Puttin on the Ritz"" in ""Blue Skies"", for example;
- Mary Martin is a terrific co-star in ""Birth"" and lights up the screen.

1815174,4,B00007J5VP,"This DVD gives us two musicals starring Bing Crosby; although there are no extras many Crosby fans will want this in their collections! Some of the material is embarrassingly dated; but still musical fans and Bing Crosby fans will like this anyway. Fred Astaire fans get to see him work with Bing in Blue Skies.

Birth Of The Blues is a musical vehicle for the great Bing Crosby. This plot may be fictionalized but you watch this film for the song and dance numbers. The convincing acting held my attention all the way; and the plot moves along at a good pace.

When the action starts, a young Jeff Lambert is getting the spanking of his life from his father--for being caught playing jazz. However, this has little effect on Jeff--he grows up to want to have the first all white Dixieland jazz band. He and his musician buddies soon meet a sharp coronet player named Memphis (Brian Donlevy) and by chance they bump into a young lady named Betty Lou Cobb (Mary Martin) who has a great singing voice.

Memphis and Betty Lou join the band and after a few flops things begin to take off for Jeff and his crew. They get their first big break at a club run by a thug boss named Blackie (J. Carrol Naish) who doesn't feel like letting them go to a more profitable job. Blackie has his ""boys"" trying as hard as they can to keep Jeff, Betty Lou and the gang all playing at his nightclub and his nightclub only.

Will Jeff and the gang ever get away from Blackie? What about Betty Lou--both Jeff and Memphis want her hand in marriage; but of course she can only marry one of them. Which man will Betty Lou choose?

The cinematography and choreography work well in crowd scenes like the nightclubs and the fight scenes.

Overall, Birth Of The Blues is good but far from the best from the golden age of Hollywood--the dialogue weighs it down a bit and there are offensive references to African-Americans.

Blue Skies is a fantastic cavalcade of song and dance numbers--even if it is held together by the thinnest plot I've ever seen in any movie! The musical numbers are sublime! We get Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire singing and dancing up a storm. The plot (or action, since the plot is so thin) moves along at a good pace.

The action when Jed Potter (Fred Astaire) has his eyes on a beautiful chorus girl named Mary O'Hara (Joan Caulfield). However, Joan isn't truly all that interested in Jed--she much prefers the company the Jed's buddy Johnny Adams (Bing Crosby). The two men vie for Joan's attention and her hand in marriage; and along the way we are treated to upwards of two dozen magnificent musical numbers.

Over time, Mary and Johnny do finally wed--much to the chagrin of Jed Potter. Nevertheless, there's still one major fly in the ointment for Johnny and Mary: Johnny isn't very ""stabile;"" he likes to bet on the horses and he always winds up having to sell his nightclub business to pay debts and then he starts over in a new city--dragging Mary along with him. Mary tolerates this until a child is born. Now their marriage is in considerable trouble.

What happens between Mary and Johnny--will they be able to stay together or will they divorce? Even if they split up, will it be forever--or will Mary finally break down and marry Jed who still loves her after all?

Blue Skies is one movie you watch for the musical numbers. It's fantastic to see Fred Astaire dance--especially in the scene that has miniature Fred Astaires on the screen dancing behind him! Bing sings beautiful number after number.

Blue Skies is best viewed as a musical with just enough of a plot to get the musical numbers on the screen. I highly recommend this classic movie musical; and people who like Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire will never be disappointed.",1207180800,23,3741,4.55886736214605
1815175,3,B00007J5VP,i was looking for a comedic sketch by Billy DeWolfe and the movie Blue Skies contained just what I was looking for.,1181520000,,115,4.2727272727272725
1815176,3,B00007J5VP,"These two Bing Crosby musicals are enjoyable, but none of them is particularly memorable or stand multiple viewings.  The most amusing aspect of ""Birth of the Blues"" is its distortion of musical history and the Hollywood studio lot version of New Orleans.  Mary Martin and Bing Crosby are in good voice and Brian Donlevy is serviceable as Crosby's friend and rival, but there's an annoying little girl rounding up the cast of leads and the stereotypes of the black community can make you cringe.

As for ""Blue Skies"", I think this is one of the (if not the) worst films showcasing Irving Berlin songs.  It is also far inferior to ""Holiday Inn"" (the previous teaming of Astaire and Crosby). Watching this movie makes you really appreciative of the far superior ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" and especially ""Easter Parade"" (both available on excellent DVD editions, and much better options to purchase).  Despite the big budget, the staging of the numbers is generally uninspired.  The main highlight is Fred Astaire's ""Puttin' on the Ritz"", but even that number pales in comparison to his numbers on RKO and MGM films.  His duet with Bing Crosby is a huge disappointment.  Oddly, even though plot-wise Joan Caulfield is the leading lady, musically the real leading lady is Olga San Juan (however, she really doesn't have anything to do in the plot).  She actually gets to duet with both Crosby and Astaire (in my estimation, the film's two best numbers after ""Puttin' on the Ritz"").  The film also has a dreadful comedy skit performed in drag by Billy DeWolfe.  Its quite painful to watch nowadays, but I guess that was considered funny back in the 1940s.

The best thing about this DVD is the low price and that the two films are included on a single-sided DVD.  They're not painfully bad films, but they're just average musicals, and Astaire, Berlin and Crosby have been much better served in other films.",1139875200,8,1903,4.854489164086687
1815177,3,B00007J5VP,"BLUE SKIES: It wasn't absolutely horrible, but there are other ways  to waste your time. Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire are some of the greatest performers we've ever had; they lead you through the musical singing and dancing to the wonderful Irving Berlin scores.

1815178,5,B00007J5VP,"BLUE SKIES: Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire at their musical and ""glorious technicolor"" best, singing and dancing to a plethora of Irving Berlin classics. What could be better? Certainly not the insipid copycat F. Sinatra and G. Kelly MGM musicals made a few years later! The ""originals"" are usually better, and this is surely true in this case. Astaire's dancing to ""Puttin On the Ritz"" is sublime, and Bing's crooning of ""All By Myself"" and ""You Keep Coming Back Like A Song"" to Joan Caufield has, if you look closely, an added debt of feeling for a usual more stoic Bing. Why? It has recently been revealed that Bing and Joan Caufield were having an affair when the movie was made! A must for and any movie musical fan's collection.
BIRTH OF THE BLUES: Although a somewhat standard black & white movie musical typical of the late 1930s, the movie contains a bevy of standard songs and jazz numbers performed by a top notch cast. Moreover, the movie is ""spiced"" by a young Mary Martin. Bing and Mary's duet to ""Wait Til The Sun Shines Nelly"" is the highlight of the movie.
IN CONCLUSION, A GREAT AND A BONUS GOOD MOVIE FOR A LOW BARGAIN PRICE. A GREAT AND MUST BUY!",1067472000,11,1164,4.521327014218009
1815179,4,B00007J5VP,"""Birth of the Blues"" is the rather unispiring tale of a New Orleans musician who 'discovers' jazz.  ""Blue Skies"" is the completely uninspired musical that mixes low melodrama with some incredibly awful tunes from Irving Berlin.  Neither film can lay claim to any sort of greatness, although ""Blue Skies"" does contain three very dynamic performances.  The first of these is Fred Astaire's brilliantly staged rendition of ""Puttin' On The Ritz"" in which he nimbly dances with 10 copies of himself, using the split screen process. The second musical number of merit is the Astaire/Crosby duet, ""A Couple of Song And Dance Men"" in which both performers lampoon the other's artistry through a series of skits.  The final spark of greatness is ""Running Around In Circles"", a tender poignant ballad that is wholly wasted on the tripe of this movie's dead end plot.
TRANSFER: ""Blue Skies"" was shot in Technicolor, and although the original camera negative is nearly 70 years old, there is little in the way of age related artifacts to suggest that much time has passed. Colors are exceptionally bold, vibrant and well balanced. Black levels are...well, black and contrast and shadows are gorgeously rendered. There are no digital artifacts to worry about, although a bit of video noise is present.  ""Birth of the Blues"" is somewhat more problematic. A B&W production, there is a visible grain structure evident throughout the film, as well as scratches and other age related artifacts.  In a few scenes there is slight shimmering and edge enhancement. The audio for both movies is MONO but very nicely balanced.
EXTRAS: NONE! What were you expecting?
BOTTOM LINE: If you're a Bing Crosby or Fred Astaire fan than you might want to consider adding this DVD to your collection.  While the film's are nothing to write home about, their transfer quality - particularly ""Blue Skies"" is worth taking a second look!",1067385600,9,1899,5.0095238095238095

""Blue Skies"" is a wonderful movie musical.  While the plot may not glue you to the screen, it's not a bad story of boy meets girl, boy wins girl, boy loses girl, and boy wins girl back again.  The Irving Berlin tunes selected are top notch, and actually enhanced my appreciation of a few of the songs.  ""A Couple Of Song & Dance Men"" is great fun with Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby, and once again demonstrates that Crosby could succeed in dance numbers, as long as you aren't expecting perfection.  ""Puttin' On The Ritz"" really led me to respecting Astaire's dancing far more than I did when I was young.  He really could out-dance Gene Kelly!  Billy DeWolfe really isn't so bad, in fact he has his moments as a second banana.  If you like musicals and the technicolor look, it will be difficult for you not to enjoy this film!

7976949,3,B00007J5VP,"This DVD contains two of Bing's Paramount released films,Blue Skies(Oct/46) and Birth of the Blues(Nov. 41).Neither struck me as particularly good,but if you are a fan of the stars in these films,you might want to pick them up.
Blue Skies stars Bing and Astaire who once upon a time had a vaudeville act together. Now Astaire is on his own performing in musical theatre while Bing runs,sells and runs again,nightclub after nightclub. Fred has his eyes on one girl he wants to get to know WAY more than casually,while she has eyes for only Bing. Fred (surprisingly)realizes this and as the film progresses the story is told in flashback, as Fred is reading it from a prepared script on a radio show. The girl,Bing and Fred go in and out of each others lives throughout,with Bing and the girl actually marrying,only to divorce,with one child involved. In the end Fred's story reunites Bing and the girl,who never really fell out of love to begin with.
Fred plays against type here. Whereas most films would have Fred relentlessly pursuing the girl for himself despite what his friend would think,here he is mature and actually knows the truth and bows out when it is appropriate. As a result,unfortunately,his character lacks any general appeal,while Bing gets all the glory and our attention throughout. The musical numbers,maybe with the exception of Astaire's Blue Skies routine,are all lacklustre and go on far,far too long. Their number together,A Couple of Song and Dance Men"" suffers terribly from this fate. Instead of stopping their routine on stage by themselves,they go on ad nauseum, to involve fellow cast members in the wings. There is one terrific moment in this film that should be mentioned. It is when Bing meets his daughter for the first time and sings her a song on the piano. Their interplay is terribly sweet and has to be seen to be appreciated. With a less than front and center Astaire,a fragile script and boringly long routines,both musical and dancing,this film is a disappointment. 2 1/2-3 stars. The film itself is a marvel and looks terrific for its age. Great print.
Birth of the Blues is a step up from Blue Skies. It's a little livelier than the latter in the musical department, and doesn't suffer from the overly long bouts of gout ""Skies"" does. It's the story of a young Bing who here plays clarinet from an early age. He likes to hang around the black players in New Orleans and play hot licks. His disapproving father is never able to shake it out of him and Bing grows up to be quite the player,knocking around the Crescent City. The day comes when he is able to finally get a band together that can actually play,and from here they go nowhere but up. However the road isn't always paved with gold,and their journey plays out that way. They finally get into a club which accepts their music but the manager won't let them out of their contract without a fight. In the end they get a telegram to come to Chicago to play and the film ends as they leave on a steamboat.
The film has a lot of good old fashioned song classics in its repertoire,some sung sweet,others quite hot. In the ""band"" there is the legendary real life trombonist Jack Teagarden,who at one points takes off the horn of his trombone and substitutes a glass in its place. This was an actual part of his act,and one that never ceases to amaze. Another individual is Bing's pal and old fellow singer Harry Barris from their Paul Whiteman days as  2/3 of the Rhythm Boys. The girl singer in the band is none other than a young and talented Mary Martin. She's stuck on Bing,but the other man vying for her affections(and losing)is Brian Donlevy,the hot coronet player. Donlevy is totally miscast as a jazz player,but he does his best. And along for the ride is Jack Benny's wandering side kick Rochester. While better than ""Skies"" it too has a lacklustre plot,but its music is what lifts it up. 3 stars.
All in all two films and neither with a single ""thought""! The plots are both pedestrian.""Skies"" looks better in colour than ""Blues""looks like in B&W.However this reviewer preferred ""Blues"" over ""Skies"" by a nose. But Bing shines in both. This is a single sided disc.",1486857600,,4171,4.6903137789904505

7976954,5,B00007J5VP,"This DVD contains two movies.
Blue Skies: If you're after a great plot, run for your life from this film. It ain't there. If you like Irving Berlin, Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, and great music and dancing, dive in and wallow in it! The plot never gets in the way for very long. Bing sings wonderfully throughout, and one of Fred Astaire's greatest on-screen dances is here in ""Puttin' On The Ritz"", which is worth buying the DVD for. Some of the songs show up in other films (how many times must Bing sing ""White Christmas"" in a movie before we lose interest?), but all the versions here are enjoyable.
Birth of the Blues: Again, if you're here for the music, you'll be amply rewarded. The depiction of many black characters in the film is cringe-worthy today, but on the other hand, the film does great credit to the black musicians who created some of America's finest national music. The film could serve as a great discussion starter on the topic of how black music became mainstream American music, and the role of both white and black musicians and entertainment figures in that process. Worth watching, and definitely worth listening.",1456790400,3,1140,4.705
