7832621,5,6302948568,I discovered Lilias decades ago when her PBS tv show was on.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of her videos,1422489600,,115,3.7916666666666665
7832622,5,6302948568,Lilias is good for a home video beginner or intermediate,1413417600,,56,4.7
7832623,5,6302948568,"After practicing yoga for several years now Lilias was one of the first instructors I learned from. I still think that she is one of the best teachers. Lilias has a very friendly and easy nature that takes the intimidation out of learning what yoga is about. This particular tape is a 54 minute practice that is an outstanding physical workout and still one of my favorites. It might be too difficult for beginners. It is challenging in the number of asanas she takes you through and her flowing method of grouping poses togeather helps keep it interesting. There is plenty of variety in the workout with a brief warmup, standing poses, floor exercises, forward bends. I am left feeling like I just did a comprehensive and physically worthwhile workout. I use it regularly. She does not use props in this workout but a non-skid surface is helpful for the warrior, triangle and downward dog. I don't think you can learn yoga from any one tape. After all it is just a moment frozen in time on magnetic tape while life and your yoga practice should change and evolve. But Lilias is a very good teacher and this tape represents not only a good class but a good comprehensive workout.",1164412800,3,1179,4.619047619047619
7832624,3,6302948568,"Lilia is great and years ago I  have practiced with her on the educational channel.  However, I  think that she rushes through the postures and does not emphasize  the importance of breath and holding  the pose.",1122508800,,211,4.75
7832625,4,6302948568,"This intermediate tape is the next step up from Lilias' beginner tape.  Much more challenging! but I found that, after having done the exercises on the beginner's tapes, I could work with this one without too much discouragement.  And I think it's actually helping my posture (which is  very poor ever since I had my babies)!",950400000,5,325,4.767857142857143
