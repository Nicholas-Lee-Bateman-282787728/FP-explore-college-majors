525214,2,6302946387,"This movie had great comedy ALMOST the whole way, until the ending made rape a joke and hit a nasty flat sour note.
And then try to cover it up with laughing? It isn't funny at all and ruined the whole movie.

What does anyone try to say to console who can be offended by this?
""oh don't let the ending ruin the whole movie!!!""

I -WILL- let it ruin the whole movie because it ISN'T funny.",1516838400,,389,4.038961038961039

525236,3,6302946387,"I love Mel Brooks. He's a comedy genius and one of my all-time favorites. But like any professional, some works will be better than others. The truth is, this isn't Mel Brooks at his funniest.

Maybe the problem is that he changed his usual cadre of actors. The lines for one character (Prince John?) were just made for Harvey Korman, who with the same intonation would have made them funnier. I miss him and Madelyn Kahn. But I also believe it is the material. This runs the fine line between outrageous comedy and a straight movie...and keeps crossing the line back and forth, which makes it confusing as to what it really is. Personally, I thinke did the entire topic better with his one season TV series ""When Things Were Rotten.""",1505260800,,734,4.603053435114504

525265,4,6302946387,"Released in 1993, Robin Hood: Men in Tights spoofs popular Robin Hood flicks, like The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991). Cary Elwes stars in the titular role while Amy Yasbeck is on hand as Marian with Megan Cavanagh as Broomhilde. Richard Lewis and Roger Rees play the villains, Prince John and the Sheriff of Rottingham respectively, with Tracey Ullman as the hideous witch. Robins merry men include: Dave Chappelle, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield and Matthew Porretta.

Elwes has that merry persona necessary for the eponymous role. No matter what danger he encounters he always has that jovial smirk on his face. Meanwhile, Yasbeck is stunning and sumptuous, particularly in the chastity belt scene. While there are a few laugh-out-loud jokes, this is mostly a quietly amusing parody and consistently entertaining. I was never bored. Several actors appear in cameos, like Patrick Stewart & Dick Van Patten. Dom DeLuise does a Brando impersonation at one point.

The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot in Valencia & Santa Clarita, California, with studio work done in West Hollywood. DIRECTOR: Mel Brooks. WRITERS: Brooks, JD Shapiro & Evan Chandler.

525301,5,6302946387,"It would not be exaggerate to state this film may well be Mel Brooks' masterpiece. Its humour is kaleidoscopic, irreverent, innovative and remarkably witty. It has many references to anthological films (The sequence of Godfather's tribute is a classic all the way through). But you'll find many twists and hilarious scenes. Definitively a cult movie that remains as fresh as the moment of its release. When it happens you may deduce why it's so loved and pursued after five decades.

525478,4,6302946387,"We meet Robin of Loxley at the Khalil Prison, the notorious Jerusalem dungeons for captured European Crusaders. Fortunately, or it would be a very short movie, Robin escapes with a fellow prisoner (Isaac Hayes), who tells him, ""My name is Asneeze, father of Ahchoo."" They part ways, but not before Asneeze makes Robin promise to look up and look after Ahchoo, who is an exchange student in England.

Robin keeps his promise and gains a traveling companion. Along with Blinkin, his family's blind family servant, left behind in the ruins of Loxley Hall, reading a braille Playboy magazine on vellum.

The bad guys, of course, are Prince John (watch his mole!) and the Sheriff of Rottingham. The Sheriff is played to perfection by Roger Rees, petulant, smarmy, bullying and getting his words mixed up.

This movie is full of doofus wit. Such as when Robin is rallying his untrained forest recruits: ""Good people who have traveled from villages near and far, lend me your ears.""  And the villagers each throw one of their ears at him.

This is not my favorite Mel Brooks movie, but it is a lot of fun. Mel Brooks directed twelve films in all, acting in all but one of them. Eight of his movies, including ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights,"" are collected in a slipcase in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Brooks-Bx-Sm-Cb/dp/B000EBIONA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Brooks Bx Sm Cb</a>.

525783,5,6302946387,"I love this little movie--and it is one of my very favorite Mel Brooks movies.  They all seem to be having such a good time as they made it.  There's something fun/ny happening almost every minute.  And ""good, clean fun"" at that.  I didn't enjoy it so much the first time I saw it, but re-watching it gave me a chance to notice every fun, cute little thing going on.  Carey Elwes is a charming and fun/ny Robin Hood.  Amy Yasbeck is a beautiful and charming Lady Marion.  Dave Chappelle added his own kind of fun as Achoo, one of Robin's side-kicks.  Dom De Louise did a perfect ""God Father/Marlon Brando"" take off as Don Giovanni.  Mark Blankfield, as Blinkin, became one of my very favorites as Robin's blind servant.  I honestly don't know how they kept a straight face while making this film--and straight faces they had.  Matthew Porretta, as Will Scarlett O'Hara,  had a special energy of fun and excellence as actor, singer, dancer--and I would hope we would see more of him in future.  Megan Cavanagh, Dick Van Patten had wonderful parts as Broomhilde, Maid Marion's Lady in Waiting; and the Abbott who is to marry Robin and Maid Marion.  Another one of my favorites was a young actor, Corbin Allred, who is so off-beat and hilarious as a distraught child.
  I wish I could describe what is so funny about this movie--and it is hard to put into words:  it's dialogue, it's play on words, it's funny action; it's slapstick, it's............  There is a scene with 3 famous race horse jockies racing camels in the desert.  The Sherriff of Rottingham is asked to deliver his bad news as good news, and he laughs hysterically as he does just that.  I laugh out loud every time I watch this scene.  The play on words:  ""Rottingham"" instead of the Sherriff of ""Nottingham;""  ""H & R Blockhead"" is the Accountant who issues the statement about back taxes.  ""Mrs. of Loxley"" is the new wife of Robin of Loxley.  And on and on.
  The dueling scenes featuring mostly Robin are wonderful--and sometimes funny.  And it is uncanny how much Carey Elwes looks like Erroll  Flynn, one of the original Robin Hoods.
  I think Mel Brooks was at his all time best on this movie.  Not only did he write/direct this movie, he wrote the lyrics of (most of) the (funny) songs--including the rap numbers. Just incorporating rapping sequences into this ""olde time story"" is pure genius.  Mel Brooks has one of the  cleverest, most  original, quirky, funny minds of all times.  Pure entertainment.  Right up there with ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein.""
  All in all, watching and purchasing this dvd are well worth your time and money.",1453852800,,2625,4.660831509846827

525952,5,6302946387,"It's kind of fitting that these two films are packaged together, because they're easily two of my favorite Mel Brooks films---and, as often happens to me, two that happen to be panned by most critics :) (When I first saw the very low Rotten Tomatoes rating for Spaceballs, I seriously thought that my numerically-impaired brain was playing a trick on me!)

Humor is obviously wildly subjective, and the wide range of opinions elicited by Brooks' films illustrates that as well as anything. His most popular and acclaimed films are arguably Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, and I'll admit that neither does all that much for me. I totally see why they work for many people, but they just don't hit my personal funny bone for reasons that I've given up trying to identify. Robin Hood: Men in Tights and (especially!) Spaceballs, however, while marked by that same type of gleefully over the top, madcap humor, delight me to no end and are guaranteed to boost my mood every single time I watch them. Something about the films' subject matter, characters, casting, dialogue and even costumes just work for me on every level. That doesn't mean that every single individual gag lands perfectly, of course, but somehow I'm so swept away by the films' energy and infectious sense of fun that it never seems to matter. And so many of the bits in these parodies work remarkably well---as always with Brooks, the proudly raunchy mania is interspersed with some surprisingly sharp, clever and witty bits of satire, and sometimes just looking at the actors' facial expressions and reaction shots are enough to make you laugh. These are also among the most quotable movies you'll ever watch..and rewatch :) (I included a personal favorite from ""Dark Helmet"", aka Brooks' version of Darth Vader, in the title of this review)

Even if Brooks' more acclaimed films didn't work for you quite as well as they did for most fans, I would urge you to give these two very reasonably priced gems a chance! I was surprised by just how much I love them.",1441152000,,2034,4.808571428571429

525997,4,6302946387,"This is a fantastic Mel Brooks comedy made back in 1993, I won't go into the story as most people should know the classic Robin hood set-up by now, its been done plenty of times in the past but not like this, Brooks is the master spoofer with the likes of spaceballs, this version is extremely funny and parodies the story of Robin hood very well with plenty of in-jokes from various other movies etc relevant back at the time, great laugh out loud gags and general silliness, Brooks style is very naked gun at times if you know the concept of those comedies, the cast is great all round here with a fine line-up Cary Elwes, Amy Yasbeck, Tracey Ullman, Issac Hayes, Patrick Stewart and many more, if your a big fan of brooks of just spoof comedy in general its a must, you don't get many like this anymore, the Blu-ray is very good value for money too.

This movie is older--it seems when people press old movies to Bluray there is some deity that must be pleased in order for the high res copy to be cleaner than the DVD.  I'm please to report that this bluray is remarkable clear for the age of the movie, I didn't find the noise level to be very high at all.  I was pleasantly surprised.

As an example, making a pointed reference to the Kevin Costner Robin Hood, Cary Elwes looks straight into the camera and proclaims he is a better Robin Hood because ""I can speak with an English accent.""

526306,3,6302946387,"Funny but far too sequenced comedy from Mel Brooks warrants a review due to the wonderful comic performance of Richard Lewis, whose amusingly effective parody of the Prince John baddie-type is worth the admission price alone. The rest of the cast does quite well in general, but the script that they are given is a true hit-and-miss affair (a clichd phrase, but appropriate here). However, the rest of the film is made up of moderately funny periodic moments, some of which stick in the mind, others of which fall reasonably flat, but I can say that this film will stand the test of time far better than the Kevin Costner interpretation which it is unabashedly inspired by. Although it is only me nit-picking as a critic, I must point out that the scripts for Brooks's films are typically constructed of spare parts taken from outrageous jokes, humorous sight gags, and various knee-slappers that ultimately add up to feature-length movies that end up feeling merely like a bunch of juvenile skits tied together (rather than a more mature approach to comedy in which the humor is built into the story, Brooks's movies are full-tilt parody from first frame to the last). Although to my taste the film is only intermittently successful, I still appreciate a lot of the movie's humor. But it's not quite as successful as the earlier Mel Brooks comedy films overall. Again, it seems to me that Mel is more valuable as a producer (and maybe screenwriter) than he is as a director, but when the public comes to expect such shenanigans from him as a filmmaker, what else can he do really? Finally, after the devastating cancellation of his short-lived 1970s TV show ""When Things Were Rotten"", Mel Brooks has been able to restore his vision of Robin Hood to the cinematic world once and for all.

526504,1,6302946387,"In comparison to Brooks other comedies, 'Men in Tights' is a mediocre effort at best.  While Richard Lewis,(as 'The King'), and Tracey Ullman (as the Sooth Sayer) were sometimes laughable; the remaining cheap bits and gags that worked so well in Space Balls, Blazing Saddles and History of the World - showed none of the 'real stuff' here. Even Cary Elwes, (so wonderfully utilized in Rob Reiner's' ""The Princess Bride'), seemed to be 'phoning-in' the jokes, facial takes, and 'over the top' Errol Flynn type of character that he so excels in portraying. Sorry Mel; this one stank to high heaven.  review by James Udel

526975,5,6302946387,"You know those movies that you objectively know aren't especially good but which you find yourself wanting to rewatch a lot anyway? This is that movie for me. I'm not someone who automatically adores all of Mel Brooks' work. In fact, even some of his most beloved classics don't quite work for me. THIS movie, though, does really work for me...just don't ask me to offer a rational explanation as to why ;)

First be warned that you have to be in the mood for unabashedly over-the-top, silly, goofy humor. It also helps if you know at least a tiny bit about the original Robin Hood legend, since that's what the movie is satirizing---albeit loosely! Oh, and you might want to adore Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride) as ardently as I do :)

Some jokes are far more dopey than they are funny (though I'd argue that's pretty typical of Brooks' movies as a whole, not just this one), but somehow this movie is just such mood-boosting, high energy fun that it ceases to matter. The cast seems to be having a great time making this film, and it's impossible for me not to have an equally great time while watching it. There's singing and dancing and humor that ranges from ridiculously broad to surprisingly clever.

I'm glad my expectations of this movie were comfortably low, as it allowed me to be so pleasantly surprised. If you're in the mood to just laugh at zany, energetic goofiness, I'd highly recommend that you give this very reasonably priced DVD a try!",1415491200,2,1457,4.596153846153846

527728,5,6302946387,"Mel Brooks has assembled an entertaining, cult-worthy hit with his take on the traditional story. Steeped in 90's pop culture, Mel leverages a team of actors that do a great job to illustrate friendship, combat, and innuendo in the most comically irreverent way possible. This movie remains one of the most quotable that I know, from the spoonerisms of the Sherrif of Rottingham to the inquiries and declarations of Blinkin. I'll grant that much of the appreciation for this movie and the cultural references will be lost on much of today's youth, but it provides a reflection of the undertones of the 1990s.
I say to the older crowd: this movie reflects much of what the high schoolers of the 80s and 90s perceived in life itself. It would be a study in existentialism and perhaps a way to better understand the ""middle crowd"" to watch this movie.
To the ""middle"" crowd: watch this movie and reclaim some of your youth. Remember when white men couldn't jump and you had to pump up your shoes?
To the younger crowd: watch this movie and you may begin to understand some of what those ""old people"" are thinking. Strange shoes, strange terms, and things like ""foxing"" were very important at the time.

In general I think you should watch this movie (see above). Fun, irreverent, and comical, I have for years found this to be the best of all the Robin Hood movies I have seen. I still watch it occasionally, if for no other reason than to remember the correct intonation to use when quoting Sherrif of Rottingham to my co-workers. With the blindness of Blinkin, I'm going to keep quoting this movie because it's fun to do so. You should, too, especially if you like awkward silences. Trust me, your co-workers will appreciate it. Keep trying until they laugh at you, I promise it will work eventually.",1404259200,,1799,4.6750788643533125

He has a very intelligent edge to his comedy works without you having to question weather it was truely funny or not. Robin Hood (men in tights) is one of those intelligent funny classics that is down to earth and not to vulgar which is another quality I love about Mel brooks movies is that it is not vulgar humor it can be watched with thee entire family and everyone can appreciate the real humor that is a Mel brooks movie,1400976000,,492,4.301075268817204

Finally watched it all the way through, and would put it in there as a site gag love fest at the level of Airplane! (well, maybe airplane 2). It is typical Brooks schtick, you get to see a young Dave Chappelle. This is not a criticism but a complement: it's the kind of movie to enjoy when you're tired, you don't want to think much, and you're not in the mood for a lot of explosions. Not as funny as Blazing Saddles but nearly as clever as Young Frankenstein. I used to think Brooks' top 3 were BS, YF, and Silent movie.

It's a little cheeky and hints at some perversion, but is much lighter on that than other modern American comedies like Grown Ups or Death at a Funeral. (Not that modern examples, but you get the point.) It's a nice mix of commentary, running gags, slapstick, and situational comedy that feels very fun overall. I bought the DVD even though I had free access to the movie through Netflix for the extra features, which included a commentary and some decent behind the scenes bits. It wasn't as impressive as, say, LOTR extended editions or something, but it had some decent features.

527938,5,6302946387,"Everybody in the early to late 80s grew up watching the iconic movies princess bride, young Frankenstein, and even later on blazing saddles. All being ground breaking comedies in of their own right and cementing there place in the sidewalks of our lives. As so with its predecessors, Robin Hood men in tights blew it out of the water. This movie of course being a parody of the earlier Kevin Costner completely politically correct  robin hood, prince of thieves, which came out some years earlier. The story follows the life of the legendary Robin Hood, the champion of civil rights, liberties, and even feminism!.

Now the Costner film had a clear cut story line that was easy to follow, while Mel brooks masterpiece has more of an unclear trajectory. The movie takes longer than most films to get off the ground, and then much like an arrow it wobbles in the air. Along the way hitting upon some ground breaking humor, however most of the time resorting to second hand gags and borrowing from previous Mel Brookss films. For instance as soon as the film opens its to a town being set on fire by the arrows used in the credits. The people in the town then turn to the crown and yell  leave us alone Mel Brooks! referring how in previous films the same village had been set afire.

Just as the movie wobbles in the air, so must a review of the film in somewhat of the same fashion. Even though the conditions and the actual product may not be up to par with his previous work

having Mel Brooks back up on the screen is always a delight. His writing always brings a certain chutzpah to the film that always makes things interesting. He also has help writing this film from several well known men in the industry, Evan Chandler and J. David Shapiro. On top of his writing ability Mel Brooks is used a comedic element in this piece starring as Rabbi Tuckman, who has newly arrived to the land of Sherwood Forest to purvey his sacramental wine and also to perform circumcisions. The second seeming to never actually catch on between Robin and his men for some reason however?

Hands down what has to be the overall best of Robin Hood Men in Tights would have to be the cast. Appearing as the lead role of Robin is Cary Elwes, who most likely resembles a young athletic Errol Flynn who behaves as if he is somewhat dawdling in the mental capacity department. Meaning that theres seems to always be a rather absurd time lapse between the world and his brain. The robin he plays is brave, honest, earnest, dashing, and of course a tiny bit on the slow side. Elwes says all of his lines with passion and conviction while keeping a straight face, even when yelling out stop that castle!.  This particular line being stated when Robin returns from to crusades to his ancestral home in Sherwood forest while the tax collectors are quite literally rolling the house away. Starring as his love interest is the ever beautiful Amy Yasbeck, who plays Maid Merrian who is a perfect companion for Robin. She is gorgeous, elegant, and she is a quiver missing a few arrows. In her opening scene the viewer finds her in a bubble bath singing with the refined voice of Julie Andrews (voice down by Debbie James).  Throughout the movie it Marian has these moments where she seems distracted, this may be related to the ten pound chastity belt she wears with acceptance.

The extremely funny evil Sheriff of Rottingham is played by Roger Rees, better known for his Tony award winning in Nicholas Nickleby. His character of the Sheriff seems to be based more on Alan Rickmans overdone performance as the Sheriff in the Costner film than based on actual legend.

The Sheriff also receives a perfect foil that comes in the package of Richard Lewis who plays the wonderfully neurotic Prince John, who is sadly afraid of just about everything.

The support cast includes the comedic genius of Dave Chappelle as Achoo, son of Asneeze ( played by Isaac Hayes), who is a Moorish foreign exchange student studying at Oxford ; Tracey Ullman as Latrine ( whos last name use to be S#@t house), who is not only Prince Johns private soothsayer but also his Chef! Then there is the ever amusing Mark Blankfeild as the blind Blinken, Robins house servant that might have been played better by someone with more hysteria in their voice, such as Ozzy Osbourne.

What is really missing from this motion picture is the thickly laded comic screen pay blatantly obvious in Young Frankenstein and Space Balls, two of the most notable movie parodies to date. The screen play seems to be more of a movie that shouldve had its script debated over for a bit longer! There are a few great jokes and jabs, however those are supplemented and supported by numerous other gags that either shouldve been worked on more or just entirely thrown out the door. Occasionally there are a few good shots but over all there is just no drive from one joke to another.

Completely deviating from the Costner film attempting to be made fun of is the overall conscience level found in the whole movie. Numerous times throughout the movie can one find bad-taste jokes about the disabled and the minorities. Yet we are all showed how messed up all of us are considering the fact we can barely contain our laughter with these jokes being so frontally presented.",1399507200,,5290,4.614893617021276

Maid Marian falls in love with Robin of Loxley at the first sight of meeting him. It becomes obvious that this does not sit too well with the Sheriff of Rottingham (Roger Rees). This is because the Sheriff also is interested in Maid Marian. Latrine the Witch  (played by Tracey Ullman) has a crush on the Sheriff.  Prince John (Richard Lewis) uses this knowledge to his advantage to get Latrine the Witch to help him defeat Robin of Loxley  in exchange for Latrine the Witch to have an affair with the Sheriff of Rottingham.

528160,3,6302946387,"Let's be honest; Robin Hood: Men in Tights is a terrible movie, but if you love Mel Brooks and you want to spend an evening not thinking about anything going on in the bigger world or the little world around you, Robin Hood: Men in Tights is perfect.  The only thinking you'll be doing is wondering if he left any sight gags out or which Errol Flynn movie he stole that scene from.  There are days where you don't want to do anything productive by the end of the day; the most you want to do is chill out, maybe have a glass of wine, and watch something that amuses but in no way stretches you and this is the perfect movie for that kind of day.

Actually, it should be a five star movie if that's what you want, but since I love Mell Brooks and many of his other movies a lot more, on just that basis I'll give it 3 stars.  It's probably a two star movie if you're in the mood for a movie with some real meat, but, for those days when any effort is just too much, this is a perfect choice.",1397520000,,990,3.984848484848485

The writers love to set up a sight gag that you need to think about for a second, and then have one of the characters comment on the scenario, saying what the audience would like to be saying. Case in point - the 'Blinkin the Lookout' scene, or the 'Achoo Jumps the Stream' scene.

It's a classic formula of sketch comedy scenes tied together into a cohesive movie, following a story that is well-known to most movie goers of the time. This gives the writers a lot of situations to lampoon, such as how Robin competes in the Archery Contest.

Today's youth will miss a whole lot of the humor and a fair amount of the shtick will zoom over their heads, but there is enough to keep them entertained... well, maybe.

I have never been a great fan of the Marx Brothers or the 3 Stooges and so, for me, Brooks, with his frequent ground breaking comic writing and his irreverent gags is the ultimate American Comedy Icon, although I know he cedes that honor to the late Sid Caesar",1394755200,,633,4.422413793103448

But I had to take off a star for a inappropriate ending, there is no nudity or anything, but it does hint at some slightly more adult topics.

528836,5,6302946387,If you like bawdy humor you will like this movie. It is a tongue in cheek parody of the old story. I will never forget the dance scene when the men are dancing  and singing the title song.

Immediately after purchasing, I got an email from Amazon telling me that because I purchased this movie from them, I had 30 days to utilize my free online rental on Amazon Instant Video.

Well, I'm remindeed that what was once funny sometimes deosn't always stay funny after the years pass. This revisit found me repeatedly checking the time progress of the film at the bottom of the screen debating whether to continue or bail. Honestly, it's me!
Just like I don't find a lot of old T.V comedies on you tube funny anymore, the novelty of this film simply seemed to go flat over the years.

There are some great cameos, off-color humor, and enough cheesy acting to keep folks well-entertained for the movie's duration.

One thing I like about Mel Brook films, including this one is he places the humor throughout while still keeping a good story line.  He is not over-the-top and somewhat annoying like the makers of the Scary Movie series can be.

Cary Elwes was the perfect choice for playing a comedy based Robin Hood with his silly but not overly done mannerisms (his acting is similar to how he was in The Princess Bride).  The characters are hilarious.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a good laugh and who like silly, put well played out humor.

529982,2,6302946387,"All I can say is: a movie that jokes about the Kennedy assassination is straining for laughs.

In the film, Mel Brooks tells the familiar story of Robin Hood, with his standard twists and gags. His use of ethnic stereotypes, which he used to great effect in his other films, go woefully awry here. Dave Chappelle, as the standard black fool, a Muslim named Achoo, actually riffs on (and cheapens) Malcolm X's ""You've been bamboozled"" speech. Richard Lewis is execrable as Prince John. There are plenty of ""funny"" anachronisms -- like pump-up sneakers and rental horses -- that I found obvious and unfunny. As was the appearance of Brooks as an Orthodox Rabbi carrying a guillotine-shaped circumcision machine. It's been a long time since rabbis and ""tip"" jokes were cutting edge. (Sorry!)

But nothing screams ""Brooks has lost his edge!"" than the JFK joke. At one point a bad guy is taking aim at Robin with a crossbow from the window of a tower labeled ""Ye Olde Booke Depository."" Even after nearly 50 years, this was appalling. Too soon, Mel, too soon.

""Men in Tights"" is a long and mostly unfunny collection of stale and obvious gags. This would have been great summer video made by your high school buddies, but it is pathetic from one of America's former comic geniuses. Deserves an arrow in the can.",1338508800,2,1306,4.744493392070485

The story outline is the one with which you are probably familiar, but the jokes, the sly references to modern material, the song and dance routines (including the title song, ""Men in Tights""), and the brilliant casting, make this one joyous romp.

In addition to Cary Elwes, whom I remember adoring in ""The Princess Bride,"" we have Patrick Stewart as King Richard the Lionhearted, Dom DeLuise as a mafia-like character named Don Giovanni, and Mel Brooks himself as Rabbi Tuckman.

That said i also know this film wasn't written solely by the man. Credits attribute the film to:
Mel Brooks
J. David Shapiro
Evan Chandler

I hadn't seen this when i was younger, but it may have some appeal to children.

First of all the film tries hard to use the dull cheap liner jokes to its advantage, but I believe the cast knew they were making a turd, some of the interactions are pretty bad. I would suggest the film might have worked better given better direction, script, acting and editing. I didn't laugh hard for a long time.

The opening rap which tries to be humorous, just seemed like another innocuous attempt to mock rap music and blacks just as the lame line that I'm certain Dave Chapelle still cringes at ""White Men can't Jump""... and who says he didn't pay his dues? this film is pretty bad.

The pacing is slow, the delivery is bad and sometimes TERRIBLE and although Cary Elwes is probably supposed to be an arrogant jerk, it doesn't come off as an engaging and identifiable character..nor is he all that funny.

The musical numbers are boring and ridiculous... the film made me grateful that a far superior film Monty Python and The Holy Grail skipped their own musical numbers with the assertion that ""Never mind. Camelot is a silly place""

There are many dated references especially the Nike ""pump"" shoe craze of the 90s that attempt to be funny but just seem annoying after a while. Maybe it's because I'm older, but i watched this film with a friend while babysitting a 12 year old. Even HE didn't laugh too much.

HOWEVER some GOLDEN moments are Dom Delouise pulling off a Godfather mock up. I was thinking ""oh god, not another Godfather cliche""... but the delivery was smooth, painless and sincere... done with flair... and had me in stiches. Icing on the cake was the stoic portrayal of a ""Luca Brazi"" type. This scene stole the film and added the novelty of laugh out loud humor (for once in the film) albeit about 20 minutes before the ending. Same goes for Mel Brooks in his cameo. Although he plays the cliched Jewish Rabbi, i guess his delivery saves the last half hour from predictable boredom.

Maybe if i were incredibly drunk I would have laughed more. But liners like ""a mime is a terrible thing to waste"" just seemed to be stretching things far too much. I've never seen Richard Lewis act beyond his comedy, but he's wasted here. There's not much to work with.

Charlie Chaplin, once stated something along the lines of HOWEVER funny a gag is, if it falls out of line from the story it will detract.. I WISH THIS FILM HAD SOME OF THOSE

this film takes many plunges into bad one liner jokes. ""So here's the set up for the joke, and this is the joke. Here is where you laugh""... If i just said that same sentence in a funny voice, chances are you'll laugh at ME rather than this film.

I know films like the Naked Gun resort to these right brain humor barrages but this film is dim witted AND HORRIBLY UN-FUNNY for the most part. It's WATCHABLE but not worth the time in my opinion. Not horrible, but NOTHING, dear god... NOTHING to attribute the word ""CLASSIC"" to.

Also my review states the film as good for 3-5 year olds. maybe except for several scenes that border on ""passible"" nudity. (nip covers)

*Grim trivial Note: while watching the film one of the opening scene introduces a rental horse wearing a tag on its rear ""Rent-A-Wreck"".
Anybody who actually read into the allegations made against Michael Jackson know the significance of this. Screenwriter Evan Chandler (who conspicuously killed himself in 2009), the father of MJ's 1993 accuser co wrote the screenplay and later made financial demands from Jackson instead of taking him to court (or doing far worse)

He met Michael Jackson through his step father who owned RENT A WRECK in Los Angeles, when Michael's car broke down.

Skip the movie, rent somethin else and laugh. Just for Dom and the genuine laughs I'll give it 3 instead of 2. Get YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN or even LIFE STINKS. This one (mostly) tanked for me.",1320192000,,4179,4.559412550066756

530012,4,6302946387,"Ok, so anything with Cary Elwes is bound to have it's funny moments.  The man can't help but be humourous.  Robin Hood Men in Tights is no exception.

Robin of Loxely has been on the crusades fighting the good cause until capture.  When he escapes (and subsequently swims back to England) he returns to find his home a bit different than he left it.  For one, his castle has been taken due to back taxes.  With some friends he meets along the way, he decides to fight against Price John and the Sheriff and their injustices against him and the townspeople of Sherwood Forest.  He also meets the acquaintance of Maid Marian and has a few more goals come to mind with the meeting.  And he'll do it all in tights.

Characters:
  Cary Elwes as Robin Hood
  Richard Lewis as Prince John
  Roger Rees as Sheriff of Rottingham
  Amy Yasbeck as Maid Marian of Bagel (pronounces Bag-elle)
  Dave Chappelle as Ahchoo
  Mark Blankfield as Blinkin
  Eric Allan Kramer as Little John
  Matthew Porretta as Will Scarlet O'Hara
  Isaac Hayes as Asneeze
  Tracey Ullman as Latrine the Witch
  Patrick Stewart as King Richard
  Dom DeLuise as Don Giovanni
  Dick Van Patten as The Abbot
  Mel Brooks as Rabbi Tuckman
  Megan Cavanagh as Broomhilde
  Brian George as Dungeon Maitre d'
  David DeLuise as a Villager

I like anything with Cary Elwes, I think he is hilarious and he did a great job of playing Robin in this movie.  Maid Marian on the other hand I could take or leave as she really didn't add anything for me despite being a main character. I did like all the side characters, they were so varied that they were hilarious.  Blinken, the blind character was funny, but I can see where he would have the potential to offend people.

The whole plot is the general Robin Hood story so there's nothing new there.  The new part is in the comedy that's brought into it.  There are some odd characters that serve the funny aspects of this movie quite well.  That being said the humour is more adult as there is sexual innuendo for some of the jokes.  While this movie is quite funny, it does have some groan worthy jokes that lower it a bit.  Some things I just couldn't find entirely funny and wish they would have left some of the jokes out to make the other ones more special.

A funny movie and definitely one that could probably be considered a classic.  Perfect for watching on a rainy day where all you need is a little comedy.

530017,5,6302946387,"Men In Tights w/ Spaceballs, what a combo package. I really do appreciate these multi film similar themed DVD combos, and as long as marketing continues with this sort of series, I will only be too happy to buy. The other reviewers state the content best, but this reviewer bought this item looking for Spaceballs, and found the double feature instead. Thanks. The quality was great, the selections outstanding, great extras, and easy to use dvd discs.
Spaceballs I liked because it is, of course, a pun on George Lucas's original Star Wars movies, and to me they are the greatest sci-fi films in history. The momentum of comedy sequences actually parallels with the non stop action of Star Wars, and at times (once again) I find myself believing the action no matter how comedic it is in Spaceballs. The effects are very good, and the altered premise of a flying RV actually works in place of the Falcon.
The characters of Luke & Han are actually rolled into one with Bill Pullman who looks like he is really into his character with John Candy splendidly as his space pal dog in guise of Chewbacca.
There are no John Williams mock overtures, and it is unecessary thankfully to distract from the comedy line, and outrageous twists. The sight gags are clever and inventive, even original and this only goes to show how wonderful Mel Brooks really is as director and star.
As for Men In Tights, I know this is a favored film of Mel's by his following, but Carey Elwes steals the show with his believable funny Robin Hood, as well as looks great in the role.",1295308800,2,1555,4.597122302158273
530018,4,6302946387,"OK... So this isn't young Frankenstein or Blazing Saddles, but overall, it's a pretty funny Mel Brooks Movie. It is a send up of Robin Hood movies in general, but specifically ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" in the same way that ""Spaceballs"" was a sendup of the Star Wars movies.

We get the usual Brooks schtick here.... Jewish jokes, (Brooks doing a cameo as ""Rabbi Tuchman"", Richard Lewis muttering ""Trafe"" when Robin drops a pig on the table), (""Trafe"" is a yiddish word for something that is not kosher.) references to (then) current events and movies, (Dave Chappelle in his movie debut, being roughed up by the royal guard, and saying... ""I hope someone is making a video of this"", and the archer aiming at Robin from the ""royal folio depository.) There's even a tribute to ""Blazing Saddles"", but I won't give that one away. (One other thing..... Only Mel Brooks could find a way to fit a ""Malcom X"" reference OR references to the first Gulf War into a Robin Hood Movie.) The jokes flow freely from one to the next, some good, some downright dumb. But the good overweigh the dumb.

Brooks is not afraid to break the ""4th wall"", cameramen and crew are obviously visible and part of the movie, and at one point, Robin announces.... ""Prepare for the fight scene!!"" AND, there's even a big slap in the puss to Kevin Costner when Elwes says.... ""Unlike other Robin Hoods, *I* can speak with an English accent."" (Trivia note: Out of all the actors who have played Robin Hood, Elwes is the only British actor to do so.)

The musical numbers are fun, (we're men,(MANLY MEN!) We're men in tights....... We roam around the forest looking for fights.......) and also the rap sequence at the beginning and end of the movie. And even though the movie is a bit dated now, (it came out in 1993), it still has enough humor to hold one's interest. Sure, some of the jokes are going to be clinkers, (lend me your ears!!!) but overall, the movie holds up well.

I really enjoyed the movie, because it showcases Mel Brooks at what he does best. Parody. He's able to tell the story of Robin of Loxley (Robin Hood) in a fun way. He's not afraid to make a few fun cracks at his religion, and he has a great knack of bringing references to current events into a story that happened over 500 years ago. He also has that knack of ""breaking the 4th wall"" in a humorous way. Not all film makers can do that successfully. (They were able to do it in ""Airplane"", when Ted Striker's girlfriend walks off, and he looks right at the camera and says.... ""What a Pi&*er."") Mel knows they're making a movie, and he's not afraid to tell the audience that they're making a movie. Some film makers take themselves too seriously. Mel Brooks doesn't do that. When he makes a movie, you can see that he is having fun doing it.

Brooks has also toned the humor down a bit from Blazing Saddles, (Not *one* ""N word"" to be found in this one....) so this is a fun movie for the family to see. The tagline to this movie says it best..... ""The legend had it coming.""

I'm glad it finally came out in Blu Ray.  Hopefully the picture will be cleaned up well, and I am looking forward to the extras.",1293321600,2,3153,4.435233160621761

Pratfalls.  Pratfalls.  Did I mention PRATFALLS?

Dat goofy Sheriff, he talk so funny!

And so on.  If I can predict the joke by recalling a Loony Tunes cartoon I watched at age 6, we have a problem.  It's not just this movie; a lot of comedy falls into this bracket, even now.  To you, it may be classic and familiar, but to me it's depressing. The only guy comfortable here is Chappelle, and maybe Richard Lewis (a wicked fly Prince John; why would they want to depose him?). Otherwise, this was just painful to sit through.",1281139200,3,1013,4.533333333333333
530026,3,6302946387,"Men in Tights tries to be a parody of the Kevin Costner film of the same name but the jokes really are not all that funny.  Being a Mel Brooks film I expected a bit more as in Blazing Saddles (which is referred to in this movie).

The cameras accidentally banging into sets or through the window have been done many times.  The actors checking their scripts is just ""OK.""

The dance numbers were pretty good; I liked the lines about being pansies and being real men.  Cute.  The horsemen blowing kazoo's as the Sheriff of Rottingham (get it?) comes galloping in.

The sheriff's mixing his words around was just ridiculous.  Why not have a speech impediment instead, something that would be unusual or funny?  Robin swimming all the way to Africa, OK now really!

Patrick Stewart makes a pretty good comic relief.  He came in as King Richard and gave the girl a very long smooch which was cute.  The chastity belt jokes were again, fair to middling'.

Overall, Mel Brooks has done better with High Anxiety and Blazing Saddles.  His Young Frankenstein was brilliant.  His 1993 film Robin Hood: Men in Tights, not so much.

Bottom Line:

Rental!

This is my favorite Mel Brooks movie! ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" has so many references to the 90s and so many jokes about different versions of the story from Kevin Costner's lack of an English accent to Errol Flynn and sword fighting. I can't think of a better way to get ready for the Ridley Scott ""Robin Hood"" movie coming out on Friday starring Russell Crowe than to revisit this fun comedy classic.

In this film, Cary Elwes stars as the charming, somewhat dimwitted upper class Robin of Loxley whom after the Crusades returns home to set order in Nottingham when his castle has been repossessed due to taxes. Elwes is ridiculously handsome and perfect for the part with comedic timing and fencing training from ""The Princess Bride.""

Robin's sidekick is Ahchoo, played by Dave Chappelle way before anyone knew how famous he would become and he would get his own show. He comes up with many funny bits with Elwes like the Praying Mantis fighting style, wearing his hat backwards, and doing a Denzel Washington as Malcolm X impression to get the Merry Men in line.

The beautiful, chastity-belt imprisoned Maid Marian is played by Amy Yasbeck, amazingly with her own hair. Instead of a Friar Tuck character, Mel Brooks plays Rabbi Tuckman, a well-meaning Jew traveling the countryside with his drunken mule performing circumcisions and the occasional marriage. Issac Hayes plays Achoo's father Asneeze who is in the dungeon with Robin at the beginning which I never caught until this most recent viewing. And who could forget the awesome surprise at the end when Patrick Stewart shows up as King Richard and plants one on Maid Marian?

This is a hilarious movie full of gags, fight scenes, and musical numbers in tights. Everyone should re-watch this before seeing the new one just for funsies and giggles and probably should pick it up on Blu-Ray for the bonus features!

Bonus Features:

There is a really fun featurette, ""Funny Men in Tights: Three Generations of Comedy"" where they talk about how the actors were found and cast like Cary Elwes being discovered from ""The Princess Bride"" and Dave Chappelle before he hit it big. Mel Brooks likes to cast a lot of his friends so many familiar faces are in this cast like Dom DeLuise and Dick Van Patten. Megan Cavanagh took a big risk by dressing up as Broomhilde for the audition, but it paid off.

Robin Hood: Men in Tights - The Legend Had It Coming is an HBO half-hour special filmed to promote the film and is pretty silly with Cary Elwes hosting with one of those hat's to make it look like an arrow is going through his head and uses a rubber chicken microphone to introduce different actors on the set but does not talk to them very long. There are many funny moments but the funniest bit is everyone taking turns doing Mel Brooks impressions for general amusement. There are even jokes in the credits so pay attention!

Like the other two Mel Brooks comedies being released this week, there is an isolated score track that can be viewed with the film. My favorite feature is commentary with the director Mel Brooks himself! He is a laugh a minute. ""I like a startling beginning! I like exciting credits! So I thought starting with flaming arrows would be appropriate!"" He somehow manages to say something quick about each member of the cast and crew listed in the opening credits and that is an accomplishment for how quick the transitions are. Mel reveals his original name and that he changed it to fit on his drum as a drummer. This whole commentary is nothing short of hilarious and he is all too happy to lie about things occasionally like finding old Jewish rapping to make the exposition rap interludes. Another great quote: ""I'm very proud of every cheap joke that I write."" This is an entertaining man rambling with his Brooklyn Jewish accent and I could listen to him all day.",1273708800,6,3875,4.695139911634757

530054,4,6302946387,"""We're men, we're men in tights, tight tights..."" So sing Robin Hood's Merry Men in Mel Brooks' comedic retelling of the classic steal from the rich and give to the poor big screen tale. After escaping from a Muslim prison during the Crusades, Robin Hood (Cary Elwes) returns home to England only to watch his family's home being taken (literally) by Prince John's (Richard Lewis) men for non-payment of taxes. As Robin Hood ventures around Sherwood he notices the oppression of the English people by Prince John and his lackey the Sheriff of Rottingham (Roger Rees), and vows to take down Prince John's rule and win the heart of the lovely Maid Marion (Amy Yasbeck). And, of course, we know he'll succeed, ""Because,"" as Robin Hood says, ""unlike other Robin Hoods I speak with an English accent!""

Mel Brooks has carved himself a niche in Hollywood by writing and directing movies that have essentially become unmakable (or unwatchable, you choose) these days: spoofs. Nowadays supposed ""filmmakers"" have no idea how to make a good spoof creating movies like [Insert Genre Here] Movie, which practically just feature a handful of really stupid jokes inserted in scenes stolen from other movies. But from the 60's on Mel Brooks helped to create spoof television shows and movies that weren't just good, but were classics. Movies like Young Frankenstein, The Producers, Get Smart, Silent Movie, History of the World: Part 1, Spaceballs, and of course Blazing Saddles. Robin Hood: Men In Tights easily stands up with the rest of these as another great movie in Brooks' portfolio of classic films.

Amongst a lot of Mel Brooks' later movies, there not a complete feeling of cohesion throughout the entire movie, typically feeling more like a series of skits rather than like a complete whole. For the most part Robin Hood: Men In Tights avoids this, mostly by having a built in plot in the material, but possibly also because the movie he made right before this wasn't a spoof movie. One of the great things about Brooks' movies is their timelessness. Unlike a lot of spoof movies these days, Brooks chooses to satirize timeless material, material that's still ever present in the media. Not only does he use Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves as the jumping off point, but he also runs spoofs on Errol Flynn's The Adventures of Robin Hood and Disney's Robin Hood as well The Godfather, Dirty Harry, Home Alone, Malcolm X, The Freshman, Mozart's Don Giovanni, Winston Churchill speeches, and even a sly joke on then President Bush and George W. Bush.

But while the movie has more of a feeling of cohesion than his other movies of the late 80's and 90's, it still feels more scatter shot than his earlier greatest works. And while most of the jokes are timeless a few of the jokes feel exceptionally dated (pump up Nike's anyone?). Also while better acted than say, Spaceballs (don't get your panties in a bunch, I still love the movie), the acting can be a little over the top at times. All of this is made up for by the casting of Dave Chappelle in his first big screen role, definitely inspired casting.

If you haven't seen this I highly suggest you check this movie out. Especially if you like other Mel Brooks movies or TV shows or wish that Hollywood could make more and better satirical spoofs than what they're doing in movies these days. Nobody knows how to do comedy quite like Brooks!

Nevertheless, it's still a pretty good spoof of the Robin Hood legend. Cary Elwes--one of those actors Hollywood doesn't know what to do with--makes for a wonderful tongue-in-cheek Robin. Amy Yasbeck is good as the virtuous Miriam. Even Dave Chapelle appears in a pre-success supporting role as Robin's ""soul brother"" merry man. But the real standouts are the incomparable Tracy Ullman as the witch Latrine, Richard Lewis as the mole-bearing, neurotic Prince John, and Roger Rees as the snotty, overbearing Sheriff. There's terrific in-jokes as Robin pokes fun at past actors who ""don't speak with an authentic English accent"", and even Brooks himself (as Rabbi Tuckman, his variation on Friar Tuck) sneaks in the nostalgic line ""It's Good to Be the King"" when King Richard (the one & only Patrick Stewart) shows up at the end. In spite of some real groaners, I can't resist such bits as when Robin urges his fellow countrymen to ""lend me their ears""...and they obediently pull off their ears & throw them at him! Or the rowdy ""Men In Tights"" musical number, a welcome throwback to the ""Rock Ridge"" song from ""Blazing Saddles"".

It felt almost like watching a serious, dramatic piece like The Adventures of Robin Hood starring Errol Flynn, which is not bad, but in my opinion a movie is only as good as what it is supposed to be. I think more of a seperation from seriousness would have given Elwes greater character depth... Ah... Maybe next time.

robin hood is very hansom, and is probably one of the funniest in the cast, while chappelle (achoo) is funny as well. the rest are mildly amusing.

the fight scenes are done in a silly way, which is good. i also liked the way the movie acknowledges that it is a movie. they break the 4th wall frequently, revel in shots including stage handlers, and even pull out the script at one point.

main point is do i think its worth buying? yes. but don't expect this to be anywhere near as funny as young doctor frankenstein.",1223683200,,850,4.234567901234568
530132,4,6302946387,"A film like `Robin Hood - Men in Tights' is really nothing more than good clean fun, in the lines of Mel Brooks other spoof films.  It's more successful than some (yes, I didn't like `Blazing Saddles') and less successful than others (it's no `Young Frankenstein').  The film pokes fun at, none other than, Robin Hood, and in particular at the 1991 Costner vehicle `Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves'.

The film is littered with comedic talent and jabs at movie after movie, but it never feels overstuffed, which is nice because that is a very easy problem to run into.  Cary Elwes is hilarious as Robin Hood.  I love his comedic work (`Princess Bride' anyone) and here he does a brilliant mockery of Kevin Costner's turn in the `Prince of Thieves' film (""Unlike some other Robin Hoods, I can speak with an English accent!"").  He is aiding immensely by a very talented cast of characters, from Roger Rees to Dave Chappelle to veteran comics like Isaac Hayes and Dom DeLuise (Patrick Stewart even graces the film with his presence).

The film pits Robin against the evil Sheriff of Rottingham and the laughs just spill out from there.  Roger Rees is flawless as the Sheriff, creating a supremely hysterical villain we love to hate.  Dave Chappelle provides some great comic relief (this was a pre-stardom Chappelle proving why he is the comedic genius he is today) and Tracy Ullman tears it up as Latrine, the witch who just wants a piece of man meat.  Amy Yasbeck is beautiful if not a tad dull as Marian, but her beauty is what attracts Robin so I guess that's all she needed to be (and that chastity belt bit is hilarious).

I don't really know what all else to say aside from the fact that this is a rompfest.  There is so much to enjoy here.  Sure, it is not a perfect comedy, and it is not particularly smart (the gags are really all spoof related with nothing genuinely intelligent being mocked) but it works very well.  Sometimes all you need is a good laugh, and this film provides them in spades (the singing and dancing bits are just the right touch of something extra to really set this film apart).  Watch out for Dom DeLuise's wonderful prod at `The Godfather', sliding in a little bit of culture in this very funny spoof on everyone's favorite thief.",1222387200,,2261,4.561881188118812

Unlike most of his movies, for instance, this one has no dead spots. It's laugh after laugh from start to finish. It's chock full of classic lines (""He's a smoothie,"" for instance by Richard Lewis; ""It is good to be the king,"" by the king himself), classic scenes (Brooks as Rabbi Tuchman and Dom DeLuise impersonating Marlon Brando's godfather that will leave you gagging and gasping from laughing so hard) and visual jokes that go on forever.

Granted that Brooks has made superior films (Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs come to mind), there is just something about Robin Hood: Men in Tights that makes it instantly enjoyable from beginning to end.  Mostly it has to do to the gleeful turns from the cast: Cary Elwes delightful turn as the bow and arrow armed hero, Richard Lewis' take on King John, Roger Rees as the Sheriff of Rottingham, Tracy Ullman as the witch, a young Dave Chappelle; and cameos aplenty from Dom Deluise, Isaac Hayes, and Patrick Stewart (poking fun at Sean Connery's cameo in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves).  Though it isn't perfect, Robin hood: Men in Tights is still plenty entertaining and funny, and is also just crying to be re-released as a special edition.

He is taxing the lives out of people using the Sheriff of Rottingham (Roger Rees) but lucky for Robin he joins up with Ahchoo (Dave Chappelle), Little John (Eric Allan Kramer), Will Scarlett O'Hara (Matthew Porretta) and blind woodsman Blinkin (Mark Blankfield) to rob from the tax collectors to give to the poor, try to win an archery contest, defeat the Sheriff and Prince John and also win the heart and chastily belt of the beautiful Maid Marian (Amy Yasbeck).

Co-starring Dom DeLuise, Mel Brooks himself, Tracey Ullman, Issac Hayes and Dick Van Patten, this is a wonderful parody of the Robin Hood legend especially of other Robin Hood movies and other movies of no genre from the legendary Mel Brooks. Cary Elwes whom you remember as Wesley from ""The Princess Bride"" was pitch perfect for the title role cause he does look like Errol Flynn's classic Robin Hood, Amy Yasbeck is totally sexy playing Maid Marian and the film's cast is flawless. Mel Brooks does add a touch of his comedy gold in this movie especially on a few funny musical sequences, It's one of Mel Brook's funniest and most underrated movies that has became a cult favorite and worth a view.

This DVD contains sharp picture and sound with a couple of extras like the theatrical trailer to this and other Brook's movies from Fox and an HBO Behind The Scenes featurette.",1206576000,,1597,4.720430107526882
530139,1,6302946387,"It's my own private theory that the decade between roughly 1966, and roughly 1976, represents not just a sea-change/high-point/Belle Epoque of the arts in this country, but the duration of a force-field imposed by aliens who briefly took over our bodies and spent a long arts and crafts holiday here, giving us 2001 and REVOLVER and BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS and CLOSE TO THE EDGE and CHINATOWN and much more in the process; and when they left at last for their home world, the bodies they inhabited reverted right back to their true selves. In the case of Mel Brooks, through whose corporeal shell the Visitors had crafted THE PRODUCERS, BLAZING SADDLES and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, that means a pushy, tiresome, obnoxious hack.

Well, it's as good an explanation as any, right? Brooks so totally lost the plot from the latter half of the 70s on that bodysnatching aliens and Faustian bargains spring naturally to mind as reasonable explanations: that's how fast, and far, he fell off the cliff. There isn't a single funny moment in his ROBIN HOOD spoof, but this is far worse than simply ""unfunny"". Few things in life are as painful to endure as third-rate comedy performed badly, by incompetents incapable of timing a gag or delivering even a throwaway line without stepping on the joke. Not that this is measurably worse than the half-dozen or so lead balloons Brooks made prior to this. On the other hand, it's every bit as wheezingly unfunny as they were. If it wasn't, would Dick van Patten even be in this? Yeah.... when I think of freewheeling, anything-goes absurdist satire, Van Patten's the first name that comes to mind.

Oh, yeah....about those jokes. They're about on the level of a Bob Hope Special from 1971, only with the racier, edgier material cut out.

""And this is my friend Will Scarlet.""

""Well, Scarlet's my middle name. (pause) My full name is Will Scarlet O'Hara. (longer pause) We're from Georgia.""

That's one of the better ones, folks. And even though the joke as written is terrible, and could never be made funny no matter how it was read, the tortuous Pasadena Playhouse pauses actually make the thing even worse than it already is. Which is pretty much this movie in a nutshell - bad ideas, made worse by terrible writing, further doomed by an unsuitable cast, all of whom flail away helplessly without any sort of competent direction.

If you must see this, see it on basic cable so you'll at least have the cell-phone and diet soda commercials to look forward to. And maybe you, too, will wonder how it was possible anybody ever thought Mel Brooks was a genius, and how in the world did he keep getting money to make these godawful comedies?

The feeling of being in a malfunctioning timewarp carries through to the casting. You expect Cary Elwes to imitate Errol Flynn, but what you don't expect is the rest of the cast to imitate members of the Mel Brooks stock company - Amy Yasbeck imitates a young Madeline Kahn, Mark Blankfield imitates Marty Feldman, Roger Rees almost avoids imitating Harvey Korman, Dave Chappelle imitates Cleavon Little, Tracey Ullman imitates Cloris Leachman, Richard Lewis does Gene Wilder as Prince John and Brooks imitates Dom De Luise, which is especially odd as Dom De Luise turns up imitating Marlon Brando with a sidekick who's imitating Clint Eastwood (Lord only knows who the Scottish-accented Patrick Stewart is supposed to be imitating as Richard the Lionheart). Weren't any of those people still talking to him?

When the hangman from Blazing saddles turns up, camper than ever, it's less of an in-joke than a sign of desperation. Brooks is too funny for it to be entirely redundant and it's certainly better than Dracula, Dead and Loving It, but the good moments are few and far between and amount to no more than a movie trailer's worth. The film could certainly have done with being a good 15 minutes shorter and a straighter face would have helped.

530183,4,6302946387,"When it comes to Mel Brooks, he has made some of the best movies in the industry. Since the 1960's his films have brought laughter and joy to many delightful hearts. Although his career had cooled off in the 1990's, the laughs from films like Young Frankenstein and Blazzing Saddles kept coming. That also could be said with one of the best parodied tales ever, Robin Hood. What he had brought was a film worth laughing to all the merry little hearts content. Although he hasn't made anything breathtaking since, it is work checking out those funny merry men in tights.

Robin Hood: Men In Tights, was Mel brooks 1993 delightful and overjoyed parody of the tales of Robin Hood. The film stars Cary Elwes as Robin of Loxly, and his return to Sherwood Forest, where he finds out his possessions have been stolen courtesy of Prince John played by the funny comedian Richard Lewis. Along the way he meets great friends to join him like Blincoln, a blind servant of Robin's, Achoo, and Little John. Along the way, he falls in love with Maid Marian and does whatever he promises to save the forest from heartache. There are so many great scenes I've loved from the movie including the archery contest, where Robin gets a second chance shot, using a patriot arrow that actually gets the crowd into a wave, and then destroys the bulls-eye, and another great moment during the film where the merry men do a dance scene song & dance Men In Tights which was just funny and silly. The twists brings a unique joy that hasn't been duplicated from any  Robin Hood remake since, and still shows why Mel Brooks is one of the best kings of comedy.

All in all, if you haven't seen Robin Hood: Men In Tights, you really are missing out on a very funny and exciting movie. It is just a wonderful comedy that still clicks nearly 15 years after it was made. I love watching this film so much, and I think it is one of the best movies ever. It is too bad Mel Brooks hasn't made anything this good in awhile. I hope he does.

Its not the best witty remarks, but the jokes are funny . . . . We've been jammed? lol Raspberry? whatever it was! Too funny.. . . Men in tights?  We're Butch!  David Chappelle, I never would of thought he would become this famous but was so funny in that movie. . .

I loved ""Blazing Saddles"", ""High Anxiety"", ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Dracula"", ""To or Not To Be"", etc. However, this film is pure juvenile hijinks - some quite vulgar. The film never gains momentum and personally, I found the adult humor rather lewd. It's a real shame considering the strength of the cast. I think Mel wasted a golden opportunity to film another wonderful satire like ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"". That movie could be watched with the family and was hysterical.  It's still worth a view if you are a Mel Brooks fan which is why I'm giving it only 3 stars. However, it's definitely not among his best films.",1171497600,,653,4.678260869565217

530255,4,6302946387,"Granted, there are some gags here that don't work, but overall I found myself laughing more often than not at this Mel Brooks spoof from the early nineties.  The Robin Hood legend and Kevin Costner's fiasco are rife for spoofing and Brooks pulls out the stops on some.  One of my favorites is when Robin and Sheriff of Rottingham are swordfighting and the camera catches them playing hand puppets.  Carey Elwes is fine as the righteous and noble Robin; Richard Lewis with the moving mole is good as dastardly Prince John, who gets toilets named after him; Roger Rees almost steals the show as the Sheriff, who gets tongue tied quite often; Amy Yasbeck is the sultry Maid Marian with an Everlast chastity belt; Megan Cavsnaugh is a riot as Broomhilde, her consort; Dave Chappelle made his movie debut as the cool sidekick Robin rescues, ""Achoo""; Eric Alan Kramer is the lusty Little John; and Mel Brooks himself shows up as the Rabbi with the circumcision device.

530273,5,6302946387,"You will absolutely split your sides with this movie.  It's still one of my favourite spoofs.  It's clever, witty and thoroughly enjoyable.  Mel Brooks is a genius.  He directed and co-wrote it.
With characters in here with names like Asneeze (Isaac Hayes) and Atchoo (David Chapelle), you know it's going to be funny.  It loosely follows the story of Robin Hood but with more laughs.  Richard Lewis is great in here.  He plays the arrogant and whiny Prince John with a mole that is forever changing positions on his face.  Mel also makes an appearance (Rabbi Tuckman) and in his short cameo, he does a great job.
This is definately one of Brooks' better movies.  It is the kind that you can rewatch and still laugh and even pick up on things you might have missed the last time.  This is definately well worth watching and I'm sure that you are bound to enjoy it.  Especially if you are a Mel Brooks fan.  I love it.",1158451200,,917,4.457831325301205

530310,4,6302946387,"OK... So this isn't young Frankenstein or Blazing Saddles, but overall, it's a pretty funny Mel Brooks Movie. It is a send up of Robin Hood movies in general, but specifically ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" in the same way that ""Spaceballs"" was a sendup of the Star Wars movies.

We get the usual Brooks schtick here.... Jewish jokes, (Brooks doing a cameo as ""Rabbi Tuchman"", Richard Lewis muttering ""Trafe"" when Robin drops a pig on the table), references to (then) current events and movies, (Dave Chappelle in his movie debut, being roughed up by the royal guard, and saying... ""I hope someone is making a video of this"", and the archer aiming at Robin from ""Ye olde folio depository.) There's even a tribute to ""Blazing Saddles"", but I won't give that one away. There's Brooks standard breaking of the ""4th wall"", (cameramen and crew obviously visible), and Robin announcing.... ""Prepare for the fight scene."" AND, there's even a big slap in the [...] to Kevin Costner when Elwes says.... ""Unlike other Robin Hoods, *I* can speak with an English accent."" (Trivia note: Out of all the actors who have played Robin Hood, Elwes is the only British actor to do so.)

The musical numbers are fun, (We're men.... we're men in tights....... We roam around the forest looking for fights.......) and even though the movie is a bit dated now, (it came out in 1993), it still has enough humor to hold one's interest. Sure, some of the jokes are going to be clinkers, (lend me your ears!!!) but overall, the movie holds up well.

The movie recently came out in DVD as a Mel Brooks box set. One can only hope that it will come out as a single DVD soon, hopefully with some great extras. It's not a Brooks classic, but it's one that I really enjoy.",1147737600,3,1739,4.603225806451613

530316,4,6302946387,"Mel Brooks sticks to his usual wacky style in this one, all the way from the opening credits to the ending credits.  The film opens with Robin of Locksley (Robin Hood) escaping from a prison in some far-off distant land after fighting in the crusades.  Robin swims all of the way back to England and then becomes friends a black man named Achoo before making his way back to his castle.  His castle is towed away before his very eyes, during which time his blind servant Blinkin is sitting on a toilet and holding an ancient Playboy-type magazine.

Robin, Blinkin, and Achoo then go to question Prince John about why Robin's castle was taken away.  On the way, they meet a few people - Little John, Will Scarlett, and the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Robin and Little John have a bit of a confrontation (and problems with their weapons during the confrontation) before they become friends.  Will Scarlett gives an amazing demonstration with his use of daggers, just before accidentally cutting his pants off.  The Sheriff of Nottingham is humiliated and tells Prince John that Robin of Locksley is back, and Robin appears to Prince John in person, crashing one of his big parties (where an EXIT sign is clearly seen in the background of one shot).

Prince John and Robin wage a long-term war against each other after the party incident, with Robin raising a band of merry (not gay) men.  Helping out Robin's band is Rabbi Tuckman (played by Mel Brooks) and his sacramental wine.  He informs Robin's men that circumcision is the latest rage - ""The ladies love it.""  Little John says he'll take two, until he finds out what a circumcision is.

The Sheriff catches Robin after tricking him into an archery contest, and unless Maid Marian agrees to marry the sheriff, Robin will be hanged by an obnoxious hangman.  Dick Van Patten conducts the wedding ceremony, in which everyone finds out the Sheriff of Nottingham's name is Mervin and the entire crowd laughs.  Robin is saved by his merry men and Maid Marian is rescued.  King Richard (very well-played by Patrick Stewart) returns and dethrones Prince John, making him part of the Tower of London Tour and naming all toilets in the kingdom johns.  The film ends with Robin and Maid Marian on their honeymoon, but Maid Marian's chastity belt won't unlock.

Because it's a bit silly at times (quite often actually) I'll give this film four stars.  Fun, stupid, and easy to watch.  I'm sure almost everyone will like it.",1134777600,,2460,4.7435294117647056

530377,5,6302946387,"This movie is one of my family's favorites, we can probably all quote just about everyline in the movie after watching it so many times and laughing harder each time.

 The first time I saw it I was entertained but a lot of the stuff just seemed silly. However, The more I've watched it the funnier it has become. I think in my case, as a big fan of ""normal"" Robin Hood movies I had to get past my first viewing in order to accept the movie in an of itself.

 Now, I've watched it so many times I can make myself laugh just by thinking through the movie. There are so many funny lines in this movie that it's hard to even know where to begin:)

 From the ""Kvetchy"" Prince John played by Richard Lewis (who says the Yiddish word ""Treyf"" under his breath (which means Unkosher) when Robin throws a Pig on his banquet table to his line ""I hope it's worth the noise"" when all the Knights come jogging in to come after Robin,

  to ""Achoo's"" Farrakan speech (""We didn't land on Sherwood Forest, Sherwood Forest landed on us!"") as well as when he says to Robin's Blind Servant ""Hey, Blinkin"" to which the servant (named Blinkin') responds ""Did you say Abe Lincoln"",

  to Blinkin's scene standing sentry where he is ""Guessing"" that someone may be coming,

 to Little John's (who says ""Don't let my name fool you because in Real Life I'm VERY big"") ""I can't Swim"" Scene as the huge Little John wriggles around in a few inches of water"",

 to Rabbi Tuchman's ""circumcision"" device and explanation of what a circumcision is (""it's the latest Rage, all the women love them"") and his  Farshnickert (far-shnik-ert) mule ,

 to The Witch named ""Latrine"" explaining the Prince John that the family changed the name ""TO Latrine"" (formerly the family name was  S___house, to which Prince John replies ""That's a good change, a GOOD change :))

 to endless other moments, this movie is a hoot!

 Also, I particularly liked the songs as well, the ""Men In Tights"" song is hilarious as well as the rap songs as well.

 Like I said, it may take past the first viewing to appreciate this movie for the funny movie that it truly is, or of course it may run counter to your taste. But for those who like Mel Brook's parodies, I think you'd probably enjoy this one.",1104364800,,2239,4.439803439803439
530378,5,6302946387,"In 1991 there was a hugely successful Kevin Costner movie that was based (albeit loosely) upon the legend of Robin Hood. It gave birth to a certain Bryan Adams song that went on to become one of the most successful singles in chart history. That movie was Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. This movie is the spoof.
The spoof genre does not have a happy history, producing more misses than hits. Robin Hood: Men In Tights is one of the success stories. The major factor in the success of Men In Tights is the casting of Cary Elwes as Robin Hood, and the writing of Mel Brooks. Elwes is the perfect swash-buckling hero, as he showed in The Princess Bride, and he plays the role to perfection here. The support cast are also very good, with Richard Lewis (looking uncannily like Mel Gibson) as the evil Prince John and Roger Reese doing a very good Alan Rickman as the delightfully bumbling Sheriff of Rottingham. Amy Yasbeck as Maid Marian falls somewhat flat (she just look too American), but as her role is not overly large the impact is reduced.
There are many hilarious moments in this movie, my personal favourite being the ""Men In Tights"" song and dance. My one criticism of the movie is that the individual comic sequences are somewhat disjointed, seeming more like a series of sketches than a whole movie. While this certainly effects the comic momentum, it is not a huge problem as most sequences stand well enough on their own. People who like spoofs will love this movie (it is far superior to most recent Leslie Nielsen efforts), but you do have to be prepared for a very silly experience.",1103068800,,1596,4.583916083916084

It's laugh-out-loud funny, it sustains its pace, and doesn't demand much thought.

The plot loosely (very, very loosely) follows the Robin Hood saga of yore. Robin, looking a lot like Errol Flynn, is surrounded by his Merry Men. They're merry, alright--they do a singing, dancing number entitled ""Men in Tights"" after trying to hike up said garments in ""Ye Olde Privy.""
Robin is lured into a nefarious archery contest concocted by the evil Prince John, with the help of Don Giovanni. This particular ""Don"" is played to the hilt by Dom DeLuise, doing a perfect imitation of Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. This is one of the aforementioned scenes that has me unable to sit in the chair! It is literally a show-stopper; so funny that it's hard to hear the lines.
When Maid Marion hears of the plot, she rides into the forest to warn her beau--accompanied by her massive Brunhilde of a chaperone (the aside to the audience by the chaperone's horse is another can't-miss piece of hilarity). Robin can't resist showing off his archery talents, however, and rides off to the tournament, knowing he is marked for death.
Need I say it--everything turns out great in the end. Except for the viewer, who has had a heart attack from laughing too hard! This is a must to add to your collection. Another Mel Brooks classic.",1038441600,61,1470,4.636015325670498

This excellent and witty film has continued Mel Brooks' legacy of wacky, outrageous films such as Blazzing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Spaceballs and History of the World Part I.
Cary Elwes probably described his own performance best: ""Unlike some other Robin Hoods, I can speak with an English accent!""  Cary Elwes brought comedic timing and a wacky calmness to literature's most heroic and stern characters.
Other great performances included Richard Lewis as Prince John who is constantly annoyed by the noise in his castle and his outstanding mobile mole.  David Chappelle brings soul to the cast in a midevil attitude sort of way with impersonations of Malcolm X and famous lines such as ""awww, white men can't jump!""  Roger Rees also brings a wacky interpritation to one of history's greatest villains.  Mark Blankfield brings and incredibly funny wacky blindman to life with excellent delivery and fast punchlines.  Also, watch out for Little John, ""but don't let the name fool you, in real life, he's real big!"" played by Eric Kramer.  Some other noticible performances were given by Amy Yasbeck, Megan Cavanagh, and Matthew Porretta.
Watch out for many famous stars making brief appearances such as Isaac Hayes, Tracey Ullman, Patrick Stewart, Dom DeLuise, Dick Van Patten, and of course, Mel Brooks.

Mel Brooks pokes fun at every Robin Hood movie ever made, but doesn't stop there; he makes fun of some of his own movies and cinematic style... this is seen in the opening scene where the village is burning down, and the villagers, who have had ENOUGH scream in unison: ""Leave us alone, Mel Brooks""!
Am I the only one who has noticed the almost eerie resemblance that Amy Yasbeck has to the late Madeleine Kahn?
The body language,  especially that little thing with the tongue and lips, the almost-lisp, the voice that can turn clarion at a drop of a hat and the comedic timing in general... she doesn't look quite like Madeleine, but she certainly plays like her...

I won't go into too many details about Robin Hood because you probably know the main plot. Robin Hood returns from the Crusades fighting under King Richard's army. He comes home surprised and shocked to find that all of his land and family name taken from the evil Prince John. So uniting a band of men, he steals from the rich to give to the poor. In the end he stops the reign of Prince John to be given to the rightful heir. And also in the mean time, he falls in love with the beautiful Maid Marian. Um, well... that's the way the story really goes. But of course, Brooks' interpretation is 'slightly' changed.
Now, let me introduce you to Mel Brooks' version of the characters. Cary Elwes is ROBIN HOOD who has 'all the people listening to him because HE can speak with a REAL English accent'; PRINCE JOHN with his ever-changing mole is played by Richard Lewis; Then of course there's the SHERIFF OF ROTTINGHAM (yes, folks. You read right. 'Rotting Ham') played by Roger Rees; the beautiful MAID MARIAN (Amy Yasbeck), the woman who is looking for her one true love; Robin's friend AHCHOO (David Chappelle), the son of ASNEEZE (Isaac Hayes); Mark Blankfield is BLINKIN, the family 'blind' servant; LITTLE JOHN is played by Eric Allan Kramer, who is definitely not little, though maybe in size of mind...; one of Robin's merry men, WILL SCARLET O'HARA(Matthew Porretta) who is, as you've guessed, is from Georgia; Tracey Ullman is LATRINE the witch; Dom Deluise is DON GIOVANNI, who suspiciously sounds very much like Marlon Brando in that role of... oh, what was it...; a special appearance by Patrick Stewart as KING RICHARD; the ABBOT is played by Dick Van Patten, who is not from the Abbot and Costello show; the HANGMAN is Robert Ridgely; and last but not least, Mel Brooks is the traveling RABBI TUCKMAN.
Very hilarious, I couldn't start to tell you about my favorite parts. But maybe I think you'll agree that one of the funniest scenes is where Robin Hood and Little John fight over the toll on the bridge. Except the situation is a bit different than what you would expect.
I don't really enjoy Mel Brooks' movies because of the many innuendos, some bad language, and some jokes which are soooo un-funny. That is the situation of why I gave this movie only 4 stars.

Cary Elwes does an astounding job, his best that I have seen to date. He really comes to his own in this movie, and pulls it all together. His charming face and his mischevious smile just make this movie what it is. Little John, who once more is anything but little also gives a wonderful performance. He is touchingly vulnerable, yet very, VERY strong. The various dance numbers and obvious inside jokes are hysterical. Especially when Robins merry men sing how 'We're men! We're men in tights :::snap and pose:::Yesssss!!'Another character worth noting is the horrid yet enjoyable Latrine (her changed name), who is madly in love with the Sherrif of Rottingham (yes, Rottingham, not Nottingham).

530557,2,6302946387,"Audiences of satire films have matured a lot on such rapid-fire comedies as Airplane and Naked Gun, but, in this movie, Mel Brooks prefers heavy handed schtick designed to make sure EVERY dummy in the Cineplex has got ALL the dots joined up - phwar phwar! Nothing ruins a comedy more than having every joke hammered to death in this way. It's like he's asking, ""Have you got it, have you got it?"" before moving onto the next labored gag. Also, picking on Costner's abysmal film is a little like shooting fish in a barrel. The best way to enjoy this movie is to impair your intelligence in some way, probably by drinking half a bottle of whisky or vodka.",983145600,6,653,4.45
530558,5,6302946387,"This movie is a definite A+ in all areas.  The acting is wonderful, the plot hilarious.  The music is to-die-for.  Cary Elwes has once again proven he can hold the fort down.  This is a must see (with butter popcorn).",982540800,,217,4.35
530559,2,6302946387,"A couple of funny gags, visual and verbal, don't make up for a tired plot and some dated pop culture references. Cary Elwes is an engaging Robin and Amy Yasbeck is a comely Marian, but everyone else here has done better, especially Mel Brooks in the writing department. This is the second time Brooks has tackled the Robin Hood story (does anyone remember ""When Things Were Rotten"" on television?), but it still doesn't hold up. Perhaps some stories are so familiar they just can't be spoofed anymore. Stick to ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Blazing Saddles"", ""High Anxiety"", or ""Twelve Chairs"".",976924800,4,587,5.0
530560,5,6302946387,"Men in Tights follows the adventures of Robin of Loxley, a man who has come back from Jerusalem, after just escaping out of prison with the help of Ahsneeze. Robin swims back to England, where he finds Ahchoo (Ahsneeze's  son). Robin has vowed to protect Ahchoo, so he saves him from some soldiers  of the Sheriff of Rottingham, who are beating him up. The two chase off  Rottingham's flunkies, and go to Robin's castle. Unfortunately, tax  collectors are dragging away the castle, because the Loxley's haven't paid  their taxes. The only thing left is the cellar. In the cellar they find  Blinkin ""my family's loyal blind servant!"" says Robin to Ahchoo. He is  sitting on a toilet, feeling a Playboy when he meets Robin again. After  Blinkin accidentally feels up a naked statue, he, Robin, and Ahchoo leave.  Blinkin gives Robin a key from his decides father.
After the three save a  boy from the stuttering Rottingham (""Over that boy hand! I mean, hand over  that boy!"") they continue their journey into the countryside.
We then  meet Maid Marian, who is singing about her true love, while bathing. Marian  wears and iron chastity belt (""It's an Everlast!""). Marian has a  handmaiden, Broomhilda.
Just then, Rottingham rushes into the castle with  bad news. Prince John is not pleased. They go on to have a hilarious  discussion, climaxing with John's visit to Latrine, his cook and sometimes  witch. She admits she likes ""Rotty"", and John says he will get her with him  if she helps John catch Robin.
Meanwhile, Robin, Blinkin, and Ahchoo find  a bridge guarded by Little John. LJ says they must pay a toll to cross, but  Robin refuses. They begin sparring with sticks, which turns comical as the  sticks break smaller and smaller. Robin wins, and then meets LJ's best  friend, Will Scarlet O'Hara, from Georgia. Will is amazing with daggers,  and chops up an arrow Robin shoots. Robin then says he must leave, to go  fight John and Rottingham.
Prince John is having a party. Robin crashes  it, and it is love at first sight for Marian and Robin. Robin then fights  at the palace. Luckily, Blinkin, Ahchoo, LJ, and Will follow, and help  Robin win. Robin and Co. go back to Sherwood Forest, where a group of men  has gathered. LJ spread the word that they are going to start training men  to fight John and Rottingham. They begin their training. The Villagers are  awful.
When the Villagers are training, Rottingham and the mob boss from  Jersey are planning to kill Robin at an archery contest. However, Marian  overhears the plot, and tells Broomhilda. The two ladies ride off to warn  Robin. Blinkin is keeping watch and then falls out of the watch tower. He  momentarily can see, but then bumps into a tree, going blind again.
LJ  and Will begin discussing how you have to be a man to wear tights. This  escalates into a musical dance number with the other Men in Tights. Very  funny!
Marian and Broomhilda arrive. LJ gets the unfortunate job of  lifting the overweight Broomhilda off her horse. Marian then warns Robin  not to go to the fair. But when Robin hears of the archery contest, he gets  a look in his eyes that say he'll go anyway. He performs a song for Marian  with Blinkin, etc. as backup singers. There's a funny scene with their  shadows. OK, crude, but funny. Robin painfully learns of her chastity belt.  Broomhilda and Marian then leave.
The next day, Robin and Co. go to the  fair. Robin is a Mark Twain look-alike, and the Co. are women. :)  Robin  and his mob assassin win the 1st round of the contest. On the 2nd round,  Robin makes a bulls-eye. The mobster also does, shattering Robin's arrow.  Robin is devastated until he consults his script. He gets anothershot! The  mobster almost shoots him, but Blinkin grabs the arrow midair, inches from  Robin. Robin shoots again, but the mobster bumps him. Luckily, Robin has a  special arrow, which makes it to the target anyway, shattering the  mobster's arrow. Robin's then arrested, and going to be hanged. Marian  bargains for Robin's life by saying she'll marry Rottingham. Blinkin, etc.  want to get the Villagers. The ""fox"" (fax) them.
Meanwhile, robin is  sized for a noosed, and the Abbot enters. The wedding then begins. Robin is  present, ready to be hanged if Marian changes her mind. We learn  Rottingham's 1st name is Mervin, which sends the crowd into laughter. Just  as Marian is about to say ""I do,"" the Villagers come. Ahchoo shoots an  arrow that cuts Robin's noose. The Villagers and soldiers begin fighting.  Rottingham runs off with Marian, bringing her to his room in the castle. He  is about to have sex with her when he finds her chastity belt. Rottingham  tries to jackhammer it off. Just then, Robin finds them. Rottingham and  Robin begin fighting. Rottingham pulls off the necklace with the key to the  greatest treasure in the world which his father gave to him. The key falls  into Marian's chastity belt. It fits! Robin then accidentally stabs  Rottingham. Then, Latrine saves her Rotty, but only because he promises to  marry her. They run off, Rotty crying with sorrow.
Robin and Marian are  about to have sex when Broomhilda runs in. They aren't married, and she has  a fit. The three run down where they find Rabbi Tuckman. He begins to marry  them in a hurry. Just them, King Richard comes back from the Crusades. He  objects to the wedding. He yells at John, and then names all the toilets  after him. Richard kisses the bride, and lets the wedding go on. He makes  Robin Sir Robin of Loxley. The movie ends with the wedding. Robin appoints  Ahchoo as the new Sheriff of Rottingham. The last scene is Robin saying to  Marian that the key to the belt doesn't fit. They call a locksmith.",964051200,3,5700,4.682828282828283

While a bit milder than some of his earlier comedies (Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein), it has a great cast, terrific songs (Men in Tights, The Night is Young..., a  shtickel of Brooks' Yiddish humor, and some great spoofs of other films.  Cary Elwes, who is so terrific in The Princess Bride and the Hot Shots!  films, and Amy Yasbeck (Wings), stand out.",963964800,3,411,4.8428571428571425

The second time, 6 years later, I bought it and saw it on video. I could recognize all the lines and gags before I saw them, and they weren't all  that funny. Some movies I love repeating the lines to and waiting in  anticipation for something to happen. This isn't one of them.
