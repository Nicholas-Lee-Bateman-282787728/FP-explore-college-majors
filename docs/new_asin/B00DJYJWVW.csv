5820532,4,B00DJYJWVW,"The beginning of this film reminded me of other comic book films that start with a child musing on current hero memorabilia in the year the respective hero was created - in this case, 1933. The length of this film is two and a half hours and for two whole hours, this film is uneven. There are GOLDEN moments full of humor, action and adventure but they are unfortunately muddled together with long drags of the usual ""I'm not the hero you want me to be"" and ""You're right, you're not but you're all there is so man up already!"" This was obviously conceived as an origin story to set up at least a couple of sequels. Whenever film makers do this, they always run the risk of getting the story stuck in really boring details dealing with really boring characters. And by the way, Kemosabe (Tonto's nickname for John Reid) does not mean ""wrong brother."" It means ""trusted friend."" I know they were probably just trying to make a joke of this but if there is a sequel, I hope they clear this up as it is an important point in the relationship of hero and sidekick. With that said, the last half hour came riding gallantly to the rescue ... From the second The Lone Ranger theme (Hans Zimmer's glorious version of the William Tell Overture) began to play, I couldn't wipe the smile off my face! And, I actually clapped at the conclusion of it :) Those last thirty minutes which began with this sequence were worth the price of admission - I just wish the first two hours had been more like that. I hope all involved have the chance to make those planned sequels as hopefully, they may get to be like that MAGICAL half hour.

Before the invention of the superhero in 1938 came the fearless hero lawman complete in a white hat and on a white horse - The Lone Ranger (created by George W. Trendle) being the most legendary of the genre. He premiered in radio in 1933 but in television and films from 1949 to the late 1950's John Reid (The Lone Ranger) was played fabulously by Clayton Moore (and John Hart) with Jay Silverheels playing Tonto. Silverheels was Native American royalty - a prince as he was a Mohawk Chief's son. Moore took his job seriously, so much so that it changed his life forever. He said that playing The Lone Ranger made him a better person and lived the rest of his life doing his best to abide by The Lone Ranger Moral Code as written by the hero's first writer Fran Striker:

The Lone Ranger believes ...
1) that to have a friend, a man must be one.
2) that all men are created equal and that everyone has within himself (or herself) the power to make this a better world.
3) that God put the firewood there but that every man must gather and light it himself.
4) in being prepared physically, mentally and morally to fight when necessary for that which is right.
5) that a man should make most of what equipment he has.
6) that ""this government of the people, by the people and for the people"" shall live always.
7) that men should live by the rule of what is best for the greatest number. (I don't entirely agree with this one as the majority is sometimes wrong but I do agree that real change must be made within the law of the land)
8) that sooner or later...somewhere...somehow...we must settle with the world and make payment for what we have taken. (In other words, you reap what you sow ... and it is so true!)
9) that all things change but truth, and that truth alone, lives on forever.
10) in my Creator, my country and my fellow man. (The film kinda ignored this one)

The two leads played their roles decently enough but, for now at least, my favorite Lone Ranger moment happened in the 1970's-80's TV show ""Happy Days"" in the season 9 episode where John Hart as The Lone Ranger pays a visit to The Fonze on his birthday. Henry Winkler played the scene to perfection opposite his childhood hero. The coolest guy around being star struck by a legend. Awesome.",1372896000,6,3888,4.382271468144045
5820533,1,B00DJYJWVW,"Hollywood has been specializing in making mockeries of some well-established characters: the new ""Starsky $ Hutch""
was played by two runts ( Wilson and Stiller). Stiller as a policeman is a big joke (unless he'd be assigned to arrest toddlers!) Then you have Sherlock Holmes played by Downey. The only thing they have in common is that both were junkies. Another big joke. Then comes the infamous minority suck-up Tarantino and decides to blacken Django! His next movie will probably be Tarzan played by Wesley Snipes (Halle Berry as Jane, Will Smith's son as Boy and Giselle Bundchen as cheetah). Now we have The Lone Ranger with Depp as Tonto; need I say more?",1372896000,17,662,4.815789473684211
5820534,2,B00DJYJWVW,"I know some people love anything Johnny Depp does, so I'm expecting some kick back on this review, but....... this was a really bad movie. The story line was clunky and felt quickly contrived and loosely put together....it seemed to be all over the place and nowhere  at the same time. The 'gags' were just silly and not really funny. The stunts and action sequences were so unbelievable and impossible that they were just ridiculous. Johnny Depp may make a good pirate but he made a ridiculous Tonto - he should stick to being a pirate. There was lots of loud explosions and shoot outs but the whole effect was one of a quickly pieced together script and story all based solely on Mr. Depps witty banter and charm as another oddball character and quite frankly, it wasn't well done or all that witty....this is just a bad movie that misses the mark and trashes the genre...was there anything good about it? The villain was a good villain....but that's about it",1372896000,11,961,4.619883040935672
5820535,3,B00DJYJWVW,"The Lone Ranger is clunky, poorly written, and often frustrating - but it's also a lot more entertaining and fun than you'd expect.

The story is framed really strangely, with a little boy dressed as the Lone Ranger meeting the much-older Tonto at a traveling fair and Tonto tells him the real story of the Lone Ranger. Maybe this makes sense if you are more familiar with the franchise, but as someone who's not, I didn't know what to make of this. To what level is the story of the Lone Ranger fictionalized in this already-fictional world? Help.

The script is also pretty poorly written; the storyline is complex, as were the far superior Pirates of the Caribbean films, but, unlike the Pirates movies, the motivations of the Ranger's characters don't match their actions. The main love interest punches the Lone Ranger before kissing him at the end...even though the Ranger did nothing to wrong her and did not deserve getting hit, even if for comedic effect. At the end, the Ranger is presented an award from the local authorities for no clear reason...he settled his own score, but the consequences of the Ranger's actions honestly weren't in the best interests of the town. I don't get it.

We also get some rather lousy dialogue, a masterful blend of typical popcorn flick exchanges as well as bizarre one-liners (""I served in Gettysburg. There were 12,000 casualties before lunch."").

Some aspects of the film do work, however. The really tragic parts of the story aren't exactly tear-jerking, but they are somewhat powerful. They pair well with the excellent score by Hans Zimmer, often elevating the stupid action or dialogue into something much more impactful than it deserves to be.

The Lone Ranger is also a surprisingly entertaining movie, for what it is. Even with so much going wrong, it's a lot of fun to watch if you aren't thinking too hard.",1372809600,8,1863,4.809375
5820536,1,B00DJYJWVW,"For those of you that don't know much about The Lone Ranger, he was originally a character developed for radio in the early 1930s - allegedly based on a Federal agent during the post-Civil War era of American history.  After the success of the radio show, The Lone Ranger spawned into a successful series of novels, followed by an extremely popular television show in the 1950s, starring Clayton Moore (The Lone Ranger) and Jay Silverheels (Tonto).  Like many other heroes of that period, The Lone Ranger, and his Indian side-kick, Tonto, stood for truth and justice - essentially following a ""straight edge"" lifestyle (never smoking, drinking, or shooting to kill).  He also answered to Tonto's nickname, ""Ke-mo sah-bee,"" and often screamed ""Hi-Yo, Silver"" while riding his horse, Silver.  Now, after a lengthy hiatus, Disney has revived the character for a new generation in the Jerry Bruckheimer produced film, simply titled - The Lone Ranger.

Gore Verbinski, director of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, re-teams with Pirates star Johnny Depp - who stars as Tonto, the Indian sidekick of The Lone Ranger.  Now an elderly man, Tonto recounts his earliest adventure with John Reid, The Lone Ranger.  Upon meeting John Reid (Armie Hammer), he is a ""by the book"" lawyer that's escorting a train carrying nefarious villain, Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner), to the location of his hanging.  Naturally, Cavendish escapes, forcing a group of Texas Rangers - including John and his brother, Dan, to track him down and bring him to justice.  Cavendish anticipates an ambush and murders the Rangers (including Dan), leaving John for dead.  Tonto, with ambitions of his own, rescues John and convinces him that he can do the most good as a masked hero - since the world assumes he's already dead.  Together, the unlikely duo set out to bring Cavendish to justice and prevent a war between the Union and Indians.  Tom Wilkinson, Barry Pepper, Helena Bonham Carter, and Ruth Wilson also star in supporting roles.

For the current generation and even the generation before it, The Lone Ranger was already a hero of childhoods past - giving way to much more interesting and far ""cooler"" superheroes, like Batman and Superman.  Seriously, who cares about a guy on a horse when there's a guy flying through the sky that can bounce bullets off his chest?  Back in the 1940s and 50s (when kids didn't have video games or cell phones), the premise of cowboys and Indians was still relevant.  However, times have changed, and apparently Disney believed they could somehow revitalize a character that has long been irrelevant and outdated.  Ironically, Disney turned to directed Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp to help bring a little ""Jack Sparrow"" magic to the Wild West.  Despite the star-power, the idea of bringing back The Lone Ranger had bad news written all over it from the get-go (with a massive budget to boot).  It's no secret that western film isn't exactly the most popular film genre at the moment, especially for the younger crowd.  Westerns can be pretty popular during Academy Award season, but they don't exactly scream ""summer blockbuster"" (just ask Jon Favreau about Cowboys & Aliens).

The high points of the new Lone Ranger film come in the form of the brilliant cinematography work and eye-catching costume attire.  From the Union uniforms to the dusty trench coats, everything felt authentic - even Johnny Depp's make-up is somewhat believable.  Obviously, it's difficult to mess up the look of the old west since all the filmmakers need to do is go out to the southwestern United States to shoot, but it's still breathtakingly beautiful scenery no matter how you look at it.  Regardless, without the proper look of the appropriate time period, any film is doomed to fail.  But, while the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, the CGI is overly abused and severely damages the imagery.  One minute the film feels like an authentic western and the next thing you know there's a train doing somersaults off the tracks, a horse running on top of a train while it swings around a tight bend and finally, you have Johnny Depp swinging around on a ladder while also on top of a train.  For a film that desperately needed to be authentic, it hurts itself by trying to be too visually ambitious - not to mention the characters are able to walk away (unscathed) from numerous accidents that would have easily traumatized or killed most people.

Aside from cinematography and costumes, the film is all downhill.  There are several scenes in the film that could have easily been completely cut out or at least rewritten to reduce the lengthy run-time.  As I sit here and write this, I'm still not entirely sure what purpose Helena Bonham Carter serves in the film, other than to highlight a woman with a weaponized prosthetic leg.  Much of the film's plot feels jumbled and overly busy, without any real payoff.  As the film progresses, it's hard to differentiate the climax from several other random shootout scenes during which absolutely nothing is accomplished other than it being just another pointless scene where the good guys almost caught the bad guy.  The pace of the film starts off well, lags for a bit, and then basically drags you to the finish line - only when you get there, there's absolutely no payoff other than the fact that you're finally allowed to leave the theater.  Basically, you'll feel like The Lone Ranger in one particular scene where he is being drug by a horse, the horse stops to ""take a load off,"" and then proceeds to drag him through it.

Overall, Disney will most likely wish they hadn't made this movie.  Number one, it will be hard-pressed to recuperate the roughly $250 million budget, let alone make a profit.  Second (and most importantly), the film's plot is often uneventful and could have easily been under 2 hours in length.  The punch line at the end (which is funny) is not hardly worth the price of admission.  More often than not, Johnny Depp feels as though he's trying to do an over-the-top Jack Sparrow impression in the desert, while Armie Hammer simply goes through the tireless motions of acting too good for everyone else in the film.  And, even though The Lone Ranger is easily distinguishable by its classic musical theme, this new film rendition overly abuses the classic tune, which often makes the scenes it's used in feel more like a joke.  If you were hoping The Lone Ranger would be a Pirates-like adventure, you'll be incredibly disappointed with the outcome.

The Lone Ranger, By Gerry O

I already had an idea what this movie would be like, cowboys fighting each other. Based on all the stories about Lone Ranger, I also anticipated one of the characters would be the Indian,  Tonto. I was right! This film is worth waiting for - amazing adventure, action, romance. It is  funny and has the most gorgeous horse ever!
At first I thought this movie was about a cowboy and Indian fighting bad guys, I was very wrong! It starts off so nicely and ends so action packed!
The adventure begins when it's 1930 and there's an old western amusement park. A child is walking around dressed like the Lone Ranger and he goes to this exhibit where he finds Tonto the Indian. Tonto tells this boy about the story of the Lone Ranger who was being held captive in a train. The criminal escapes and a man helps Tonto escape as well. The train crashes but they and the passengers don't get hurt. This man joins his brother to look for the criminal. The brother and everyone else in the group dies but the man, whose name is John, lives. Tonto escapes jail and finds John and what's called a spirit horse. The two men and the horse go on many adventures and run into many problems (that the horse usually ends up fixing!) as they search for the criminal. Along the way, they get a little surprise!
The movie is immaculate. The actors are great! I mean who doesn't like Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp?! The cinematography is stupendous! Everything is just fantastic! There's really nothing to complain about in this movie.
My favorite scene is when Tonto finds all the dead rangers. He digs up little graves and tries to take what he can from them. Thinking all of them are dead he goes to John and he tries to take something and then John wakes up. Tonto is all surprised and just knocks him out and starts putting sand back on him.  The house saves John in this situation, but you have to watch the film to see the most hilarious scene of all.
Since this movie has quite a lot of action and quite a bit of violence as well, I recommend it for  ages 12 and up. This movie is fantastic to its core so I give it 5 out 5 stars plus a few more if possible. This movie will be available in theaters everywhere July 3rd

The Lone Ranger, Reviewed by Raven D

""The Lone Ranger"" tells the story of lawman John Reid and how he transforms into the Wild West legend known as the Lone Ranger. When the justice is threatened by Butch Cavendish, John, played by Armie Hammer, teams up with Native American Warrior Tonto, played by Johnny Depp to save the day. The story is told by an elderly Tonto years after the Lone Ranger's reign, so is the legend just a fable? Or, did this crusader of justice really roam the Wild West?

I enjoy this film a lot. I feel that the costumes, set and film location stay very true to the style of old westerns while also keeping the visuals interesting and giving it a modern quality. I really like all of the scenery shots, especially in the desert. The arches and wildlife views make good transitions and I enjoy the artistic vibe it brings to the screen. I love the makeup and prosthetics that were used on Johnny Depp when he plays the elderly version of Tonto. It is so realistic and incredible that I could hardly even tell it was Johnny Depp! I also really love that Silver, the Lone Rangers trusty steed, does the craziest things throughout the film. At the most random times Silver will just be in a tree, on a roof, wearing a hat...and nobody questions it. It brings a sense of playfulness and lightens the mood and seriousness of the film.

My favorite character is Tonto because Johnny Depp does an excellent job portraying this character. He says the funniest things and makes very comical remarks throughout the film, which I really enjoy. I did think this would be a serious film, but it was actually quite humorous and light-hearted and Tonto has a big part in that. Tonto has a dead bird that he wears on his head and he always tries to feed it which was hilarious to watch!

I recommend this film for ages 13 and up because of violence that typically goes along with westerns. I think ""The Lone Ranger"" is funny, entertaining, and very thrilling. I give it 4 out of 5 stars so be sure to check out the ""Lone Ranger.""

5820538,4,B00DJYJWVW,"We were fortunate enough to have seen a sneak preview of ""The Lone Ranger"" at the theatre on the military base where we live, and my family really enjoyed it.  We had a great time.  In fact, judging from the reactions of the packed house, everyone there was having a great time.

Johnny Depp was, in my opinion, wonderful as a slightly edgy Tonto.  His comedic and dramatic timing were right on target, and his interpretation of Tonto -- as he was written for this movie -- was well done.  The same can be said for Armie Hammer in the lead role.  We watched his character evolve into The Lone Ranger in a remarkably believable manner.  The character was definitely different when compared at the beginning and ending of the movie.  We thought that the concept of Silver, and from where he came, was creative and added well to the story.  There was a LOT of laughter, cheering and even some booing (at the villains).  The line between the good guys and the bad guys was boldly drawn in the desert sand, and the audience reacted well.  There were tragic parts that were so sad that I could have heard a pin drop.

Was it a cinematic masterpiece?  No.
Were there overly long, boring parts?  Yes, two to be exact.
Was the love story epic?  Nope.
Were some parts predictable?  Yes.
Was the movie true to the '50's tv show?  No... and thank goodness.  It was clearly not meant to be identical to the series, instead trying to bring a new twist to an old favorite.  I think it paid homage in a grand fashion, and stayed true to itself at the same time.

Basically, if you like movies that have light-hearted humor, sarcasm, some (somewhat brutal) violence, good vs evil, and two pleasing-to-the-eyes heroes, then this is an enjoyable 2+ hours.  There were children of all ages present, and they all seemed to love it.  Recommended!",1372636800,385,1824,4.513761467889908
5820539,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Why do they DO that? This bold, handsome, and wildly entertaining PG-13 romp, also contains nasty hints of cannibalism, sadistic stabbings, and heartless, point-blank gunshots! Not like the thrilling days of yesteryear....

This entire story is told in flashback. In 1933 San Francisco, a boy goes into a Wild West show where he sees three life-size dioramas: an American buffalo, a grizzly bear, and a ""Noble Savage,"" which turns out to be an elderly Tonto, who comes to life and immediately starts lying to him. The boy knows his legends though, and argues back. Brilliant make- up, by the way!

Director Gore Verbinski (""Pirates of the Caribbean"") swings wildly between a goofy white horse that seems to be right out of ""Cat Ballou,"" to a poignant love story that left us wanting more.

These guys are workin' it:
  * Armie Hammer (""Mirror Mirror"") is our eponymous hero, white hat, white stallion, silver bullet and all. This is where we learn what turned mild-mannered attorney John Reid into a legendary Texas Ranger. He is so earnest it makes the comedy very, very funny.
  * Johnny Depp (""Dark Shadows"") is Tonto, his stalwart (?) sidekick (do you know what ""tonto"" means in Spanish? I didn't think so... Look it up!) Our two heroes are at odds through most of the movie, linked only by circumstance.
  * James Badge Dale (""The Grey"") is Dan Reid, the brother who married the woman John loves. Dan is a heroic Texas Marshall, soon killed in the line of duty.
  * Ruth Wilson (""Anna Karenina"") is Rebecca Reid, the woman they both adore.
  * Tom Wilkinson (""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") is Latham Cole, the ambitious railroad magnate who is linking the East and West coasts by rail.
  * William Fichtner (Lots of TV) is the dastardly villain Butch Cavendish. Our hero refuses to shoot him because ""violence never solved anything.""

I mentally divided this 2 1/2-hour PG-13 outing into five sections:
  1.) The first 30 minutes or so tell us how an icon is created; it is laugh-out-loud funny and ends with a rousing rendition of the William Tell Overture, which as we know is our hero's theme song;
  2.) The second section includes the massacre of an Indian tribe;
  3.) The center section is again very funny;
  4.) Then about 30 minutes that feature more cold-blooded killing;
  5.) The final action-filled section (with an encore of the William Tell Overture) takes place on moving trains and contains slapstick and sight gags that would have done Buster Keaton proud!

I feel so sad because I would LOVE to recommend this wholeheartedly. Maybe you can fast forward your DVD from Amazon through the icky parts? (I know I'll own the DVD because of the funny and poignant scenes; Armie Hammer is wonderful.) Sigh....",1372291200,8,2729,4.8004291845493565
5820540,1,B00DJYJWVW,"The original lone ranger in film began with ""Enter the Ranger"" and while this movie does take much of the story into account when telling the first 30 minutes or so of this movie, it is more of a parody or spoof than it is the telling of the legend.

To start off , the movie is a flash back of Tonto as he tells a kid his tale at a local carnival. I guess, maybe you could say this was Tonto's version of the tale as it certainly wasn't the Ranger's vision.

The Butch Cavendish Gang was the villain for both the movie and the original TV Show Episode and he did setup an Ambush with Collins. Collins in the series was a half-breed outcast and Butch Cavendish shot him in the back the moment he was done with the Rangers (yes he survived and was brought to justice by the Lone Ranger and Tonto). The scenery for the Ambush appeared to be the exact same location and that's a pretty cool tribute on the part of those making the movie so I give them credit for that.

With the Ambush, the TV show had all six Rangers shot and all six Rangers actually were fighting back with their own guns. The Movie had 5 of the 6 Rangers fighting back with the man who would become the Lone Ranger refusing to wield a gun even to save his life. Of course, they're all left for dead in the TV Series where the movie has Butch Cavendish playing the part of Shiite Militia Style Villain and eating the lead Rangers heart (Very bizarre twist). Overall, this was altered in a way that left you uninspired by the Lone Rangers plight and more disgusted at the character of the villain.

When Tonto entered the scene in the original story, he found the John Reid (The Lone Ranger) by a creek that he crawled to for sustenance and the trinket was around John's neck as it was given to him by Tonto when Tonto was a boy, you see the Ranger saved his life then when he was younger after a band of renegade Indians killed Tonto's tribe (He also nicknamed him Kim-O-Sabe at that time). In the new story, Tonto finds Reid lying near his brother and he finds the trinket around Dan Reid's neck but, Tonto never recognizes the amulet as his own and claims it was given to Dan by another tribe for being a peace keeping trusty scout. Another discrepancy is that John Reid tells Tonto to dig the 6th grave as it is his plan to remain dead and fight for justice as a Lone Ranger that hunts the outlaws of the region.

As for Silver, that was always John Reid's horse, he wasn't some mystical beast that could practically fly. Silver never pointed toward the grave to indicate the man that would be the hero.

Ultimately, Tonto was not grateful to John Reid for anything in this new rendition because, this Ranger never really saved his life and nursed him back to health when he was younger. Basically, there was no real bond between the men and the one that developed in this story was very shallow at best.

Anyway, this movie to me represented a huge disappointment and I would rather that it were given the ""True Grit"" treatment as a remake but instead, it got ""The Green Hornet"" treatment. Of course most people will never know the original legend because it was before their time but, those of us who knew it will be disappointed by this story.",1372204800,8,3216,4.305785123966942

Poor Editing and transistions
***SPOILER****
Long boring backstory at the beginning which ends with Butch Cavendish, but evil bad guy cutting out and eating one of the characters heart.
Scenes with Johnny Depp are an attempt to copy the stoic nature of the Hollywood Movie Indian trope, but doesn't work.
Expositional scenes with the ""Old"" Tonto are confusing and really add nothing except run time to the movie.
Hammer and Johnny Depp both seemed to be acting in a different movie. All of the other actors could have just been CGI cartoons.  In fact Roger Rabbit like characters might have made the film better.
Any show in the series ""Arrested Development"" is better than this movie.  Definitely the Netflix ""Lost in Space"" is better.
Didn't expect a Ron Howard success here, but the editing is terrible. The movie should have cut the expositional scenes from the 30s, the consumption of the human heart, showing someone projectile vomiting, and cut 15 minutes easily.

5820614,5,B00DJYJWVW,"This movie is great. Everything about it is great. I watched it several times. Its intended reminder of greed and corruption of most the people who worked for and worked with the United States Government, was clear to me. It also reminded me, as I learned about it, that there were some individuals who really did believe in ""...justice for all"". And it also gives a slight reminder of the presence of the encroachment of religious proselytizers on unwary and vulnerable individuals. And, today the United States would be the greatest government in the world, if all the people working for it were Just. Any government is only good as the people who work for it.

Tonto, the foolish child, did what almost all children would have done. He wasn't wise enough to realize the damage that his trade would cost his entire village. He only thought of himself. Unfortunately some adults are still like foolish children. Many of them work for governments. Many of them work for corporations like the United States Government. It wouldn't surprise me if this movie portrays accurately the corruptions in the Government, its military, its contractors, and its use of criminals disguised as Indians. And as it should be expected, the public easily is manipulated to believe that all this corruption is for their own good.

His comic timing is spot on, he holds his own alongside Johnny Depp.  The horse gags were totally hilarious.  I really enjoyed seeing Helena Bonham Carter's madame in a few scenes, too.  It's always interesting to see Barry Pepper pop up in military character roles.  There's a few really really scary and gory things that kids under 10 probably shouldn't see involving bad guys and cannibalism. If you have older kids, I think it presents a good alternative to textbook American history, and should spur some interesting discussions with young people.  I'll probably watch it a second time.  The stunt sequences on the train were some of the most complicated I've ever seen in a blockbuster.  I don't understand why this was panned by critics.

5820663,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I was channel surfing recently when I noticed that the 2013 film The Lone Ranger had just started. There wasn't much else of interest to watch, and I thought I'd give it go and see just how ""bad"" it was. I remembered being off-put by the image of Johnny Depp as a Native-American with a dead bird on his head (tonto translates as fool in Spanish), and I assumed that this wasn't a serious retelling based on the iconic television series that I recalled from my youth, maybe even worse than 1999s The Wild, Wild West with Will Smith. Apparently most reviewers felt the same way, as it was almost universally panned, although the train finale was generally reluctantly praised. On this initial viewing I kept asking myself what the heck is this? The elements for a dark origin story were there, but that possibility was undercut by the John Reid character more bumbling into rather than evolving into the masked crusader. There were also so many bad guys it was hard to keep track of just who we were to focus on as the principle villain. And then there was Depp injecting his usual weirdness into his not-so-wise Tonto, and perhaps not surprisingly he hogs most of the attention.

Still, I found myself intrigued by Reids transformation, and the seemingly detached story lineswhich involved corporate America, manifest destiny, the military-industrial complex, psychopathic criminals being accomplices for supposedly law-abiding robber-barons, and of course the theft of Native-American landall which ultimately made sense in the end, and the climactic scene in which all the bad guys met their just ends at the hands of two seeming misfits, out-of-place in this new world order, was indeed ""thrilling"" and suitably propelled along by the William Tell Overture (which Ive read younger viewers had no clue that for people my age this and the Lone Ranger were inseparably intertwined). If the action sequences during the climax seemed a bit outlandish, relative to what? At least it seemed realcertainly more real and human than your typical super-hero and gender-correct action fare.

I wondered if this film had been given a fair shake by film critics, which Depp and Armie Hammer (as the Ranger) accused them of not giving it because of well-publicized production problems. I purchased the film on DVD and watched it again a week later just to make sure my second thoughts were valid. Critics had attacked the film for its contradictory tone, its length, for supposedly being made for adolescent boysand I began to wonder if  it wasn't complete ""morons""having a bad day at the office who were responsible for these negative reviews, then it was just critics who suddenly lost their ability to judge a film on its own merits, based on some vague memory of the mythical days of yesteryear. Even the revisionists have tempered their praise by saying the movie wasn't perfect, but what movie is? How many Academy Awards did Titanic win? When I saw it a theater I was sound asleep forty minutes into it; it must have been some internal alarm clock that awoke me an hour later, just in time for when that film actually started getting interesting.

I thought that Depp and Hammer made for a fine comic duo (particularly at those times when straight-arrow Reid interfered with Tontos quest for vengeance against the wendigos who as a child he inadvertently aided in the massacre of his tribe, after trading the location of a rich silver lode for a cheap pocket watch), and the only time I thought the movie dragged was during scenes when the main villain (played by Tom Wilkinson) tried to insinuate himself into the life of the wife of Reids deceased lawman brother, in the hopes of adopting her son as his heir to a rail empire paid for by that ill-gotten silver fortune.

Overall I found the film not just a lot of fun from start to finish, but an even educational way to spend 150 minutes of leisure time, worthy of repeat viewingand it deserves a sequel, as obviously was intended before it sunk at the box office. The Blu-ray version is one of the better I have seen, the near perfect video and audio rendering the blending of the natural surroundings and action even more awe-inspiring.",1514937600,11,4186,4.816411682892907

5820668,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Im a big fan of Gore Verbinskis Pirates of the Caribbean films and a fan of westerns so I was pretty excited when I heard Verbinski was directing a western in the vein of Pirates of the Caribbean. It even costarred Johnny Depp. Then the reviews came out. An aggregate score of 31% on rottentomatoes is pretty devastating but it had a 51% audience score. Thats a wide gap but in the end it was the abysmal box office numbers that ensured that there would be no sequel. The biggest complaints I saw was the inconsistent tone and the films length.

So is there an issue with tone? Well, we have a ton of humor and cartoon action in a movie where the villain cuts out and eats the heart of the main protagonists brother. We don't actually see the deed but its still pretty hard core. Personally, I didn't feel that the tone damaged the film for me. What I can say is that this Lone Ranger is about as true to the character as the Devlin/Emmerich Godzilla was to the original Japanese Kaiju. If you're a big Lone Ranger fan you're likely to be disappointed and in the end Tonto (Johnny Depp) is the star of the movie. I, for one, have no investment in the character so I didn't mind the massive changes.

I can imagine Verbinski thinking, What the hell!?!? His three Pirates movies grossed nearly $2.7 billion dollars. They weren't darlings of the critics but never got close to a 31% aggregate score. The Pirates films were basically critic proof and audiences really enjoyed them. Lone Ranger is definitely not a perfect film but 31% is WAY too low. The set designs are absolutely gorgeous and the outdoor landscapes are breathtaking. The plot is much simpler than in the Pirates movies and the villains are better, in my opinion.

The Lone Ranger came out in 2013 and here we are four year later and Im reviewing it because the professional reviewers scared me away. I went into this movie with huge reservations but the more I watched it the more I enjoyed it. The first time I saw Pirates of the Caribbean it was a revelation. Verbinskis ability to create over the top action mixed with humor is second to none and all you have to do is watch On Stranger Tide, directed by Rob Marshall, to see the considerable drop in quality. Verbinski is at the top of his game here and sadly this may have irreparably damaged his career in directing these kinds of films. This really feels like a film done in by the reviewers. These are the same reviewers who gave Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull a 77% and the massively overrated Force Awakens a 93%. The Lone Ranger is better crafted than both those films.

As far as Im concerned this is a fine western with great casting, a better than average script and some excellent action. To me, its just a fun film and when I watch reviews online its clear that we have vastly differing views of the films quality. At 149 minutes it is a long film but I didn't feel like it was dragging or had excessive padding. I can see myself sitting back and enjoying this film several more times.",1512345600,,3036,4.425760286225403

5820715,5,B00DJYJWVW,"This is undoubtedly one of the most underrated films of all time. I feel strongly that in the future The Lone Ranger will be considered a classic. Believe me I was stunned to find out I'd let this one get by me for so long.  I'm pretty sure I know one of the reasons why it didn't do well at the box office because I myself was guilty of one particular thing. That being I wanted to see Johnny Depp. Not Johnny Depp covered in makeup.  More wrong I could not have been.  He comes thru that truly beautiful makeup loud and clear.  Depp plays the part of Tonto with wonderful straight-faced humor. When Tonto is being funny, which he is throughout the movie, he's being completely serious. But Depp gives a heartbreaking poignancy to this character that surrounds his story without once interfering with the fun. If that sounds impossible remember this is something that he does better than anybody since Chaplin.
As to the title character the actor, Armie Hammer is not someone I was familiar with at all. He's a tall, 6'5"", really good-looking guy. But don't hold that against him. His take on the masked man is terrific.  He does his own lifting. Depp does not have to carry this somewhat unknown actor at all.  He plays the comedy straight up and wonderfully well. Yet, there are moments throughout the movie when his face shows that he understands that even the good white man has misunderstood and behaved badly towards the Native American.  A split second where his eyes say to Tonto ""I don't mean it like that"" is truly touching.
I love this film. It's fun and exciting and you will have a great time watching it. It will put and keep a very large smile on your face.  The big finale to Wm Tell's 1812 Overture is joyful and thrilling.
There's so much more to this film thanks almost entirely to Johnny Depp's performance that it will likely take years for the critics to get it.  And that's the other reason it wasn't a hit initially. The critics. They either just don't get him or they keep bashing his films trying to prove they're right and we're wrong about all the ""Pirates"" movies which they invariably disdain but bring in billion$ despite what they say.
Depp's Tonto truly leaves his mark everywhere on this big beautiful film. Make no mistake. It's his story.  If the critics do or don't get it doesn't matter.  Real people who see this film love it.  I know this because I've asked more than a few who've seen it--is it just me or is this movie really as good as I think it is?  It's not just me.
Chaplin's The Gold Rush was almost universally panned by the critics when it was first released. They hated it. But the ticket buying public went to see it anyway.  We've known for almost a hundred years who got that one right the first time.  It took a while but they did eventually admit they were totally off base on that little gem. Another case in point--The English Patient. The overwhelming critical praise of that incredibly dull pointless bore of a film essentially won it the Oscar.  People simply refused to believe their own eyes and thought they must be missing something because all the critics absolutely raved about it.  It took a little while but we, the tired unwashed masses finally shook off the feeling that there must be something wrong with us and said, ""Hey! This thing sucks!"".  Boy. Did it ever.
Critics?  Way overrated.  Believe what you see.",1504656000,,3383,4.523809523809524

5820721,3,B00DJYJWVW,"It was ok and quite entertaining, although generally, I don't really care for the modern day Disney productions (the old Disney films, Sleeping Beauty, the original Fantasia, 20,000 leagues under the sea, etc were great). Anyway I enjoyed watching it (rental), but won't buy it. My main pet peeve (caused me to go down one star) was the filming locations. The story was supposedly set around Colby Kansas, but it was obviously filmed in the Four Corners area (Southwestern Colorado, Northwestern New Mexico, Northeastern Arizona and Southeastern Utah). These are two drastically different geographical areas that stick out like a sore thumb, to anyone from the Western US. To me it would be like watching, say Laurence of Arabia, if it had been filmed on location in the Canadian Rockies, or Pirates of the Caribbean filmed in the Aleutian Islands.

With all the expense involved with shooting on location, I cant see why they couldn't have filmed it in the Great Plains states, or better yet, simply have the story take place in the Desert Southwest.  I suppose though, that a lot of folks from the eastern US and other countries, for sure, would never notice. As most of the viewing audience would be from these areas, then I suppose thats why the didn't bother to make the scenery and story area more congruent.",1502064000,,1314,4.861607142857143

One scene with the trains with Johnny Depp, very reminiscent of Pirates of Caribbean. (But then this is directed by Gore Verbinski too so it was obviously an ""inside"" joke.)

And I must admit Johnny Depp as Tonto did steal the show. His unique characterization of the Lone Ranger's trusty partner had both of us laughing throughout the film. It was a campy, comical twist to the old story. The soundtrack variations on the William Tell Overture are so inspired, I had to buy the CD. On the downside, it seems Disney had a limitless budget for producing the movie because, in my opinion, it is overproduced. My GF and I are both middle-aged professionals yet we had difficulty following the story line, the plot overlaps, the twists and turns of too much to mentally process. The Lone Ranger of 2013 could have been just as entertaining with a less-complicated screenplay. For certain, it needs to be viewed on a large screen television. My 21"" computer screen was inadequate, especially for the night scenes. Yet, all in all, I still give it 4 stars because many of the scenes have me laughing a week later.

I never saw it when it originally came out partially  due to the horrible reviews. Yes, I know all about the TV show as my mom loves it and I watched it when I was little. Plus, Westerns aren't 'my thing' anyway.

Let me tell you. Now I can see why some people love Johnny Depp so much, he played his role SO well - he made the movie, imo. There's a lot of funny parts but not in a slapstick way.

It bears little resemblance to the old TV show of the 1950s, and that's a pretty good thing. That Lone Ranger was a bit self-righteous and typical of the TV heros of the day--that is, a little simple and one-dimensional. Anyway, here we have a naive Ranger who finds himself on the short end of a stick he doesn't understand, whereas Tonto has grown wizened by the events of his life without losing inner integrity.

5821058,1,B00DJYJWVW,"Ah! Disappointed. On the good side, Johnny Depp's excellent acting brings Tonto to life in a very touching way, especially with him as the aged Tonto in 1933 telling his story to an energetic young kid. And the Lone Ranger is excellently brought to life by Armie Hammer.  But whereas in Pirates of the Caribbean we knew it was all fantasy with Davy Jones emerging from the sea, on land, and dealing with a somewhat historical duo, the lack of attention to detail is upsetting.  Tonto is dressed as a Crow warrior and held forth as a Comanche.  Who cares? Me. The scene is billed as Cosby, Texas but is instead is Monument Valley.  It holds forth all capitalists as evil and prostitutes as moral. I don't want my kids to see that stuff. The Lone Ranger character is a fool ""true believer"".  The Presbyterians are held forth as fools and victims.  It is full of white guilt/imperial guilt and historical revisionism.  This is a far cry from the earlier Lone Ranger and Tonto of ""yesteryear"" and shows how far down our society has descended in these times.",1473292800,,1053,4.569148936170213

But I also love Johnny Depp and his humorous take on this traditional story.  If fact I liked it better than I thought I would.  I only buy movies I want to watch more than twice, otherwise there is no point.  This movie has paid for itself.  In some ways it's Captain Jack Sparrow meets the Lone Ranger.  Both main characters are truly characters and play off each other wonderfully.  And the action is unique and amazing.  I saw it the first time on the big screen.  Still wish I could.

Amazing way the tale is told and how it holds you in a rollercoaster of tragedy, deceptions, plots within plots,  lots of humor (but you really would have to have known the original characters) well  timed stunts and of course when the action takes off near the end and the solidifying of the bond between Tonto and the Lone Ranger you have the iconic theme to the Lone Ranger ""The William Tell Overture"" or as most know it the theme of the Lone Ranger.",1468800000,5,857,4.283950617283951

5821163,2,B00DJYJWVW,"This film has great production values and tons of eye candy.  It fails miserably, however, in the all-important screenplay and script area.  Many fine actors are wasted portraying cartoon characters instead of believable film characters.  To draw a line of comparison, one could take Jimmy Stewart in his film with Marlene Dietrich, Destry Rides Again.  That film had many light moments, but serious ones as well, because the lead actor was not a cartoon character, much like Bob Hope or Jerry Lewis and their silly Westerns. Stewart had depth; this lead actor has no depth at all.  Depp, who is wasted in this film, COULD have had a meaty role, but his imitation of Little Big Man's Dustin Hoffman (courtesy of the writers) completely prevented him from playing the role straight.  The story is a mix of violence and slapstick comedy; not a very good recipe in my opinion.",1467072000,,873,4.825503355704698

5821192,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Released in 2013, The Lone Ranger tells the story of John Reid, the so-called lone ranger (Armie Hammer), and his native companion, Tonto (Johnny Depp). The famous duo seeks to bring the notorious Butch Cavendish to justice (William Fichtner). Ruth Wilson and Helena Bonham Carter are on hand in periphery roles.

Im not big on movies that mix unrealistic comedy with drama and eye-rolling action, but The Lone Ranger surprisingly finds an agreeable balance. What especially makes it work are the two leads: Depp is magnetic and interesting as Tonto while Hammer is likable as the Lone Ranger. The format of the elderly Tonto chronicling events from decades earlier is reminiscent of 1970s Little Big Man, not to mention the mixed tone. There are also nods to other notable Westerns, like the music straight from 1968s Once Upon a Time in the West. One of the best bits is when the Lone Ranger exuberantly exclaims, Hi ho Silver, away! to which Tonto responds in a flat voice, Don't ever do that again. Speaking of Tonto, his iconic look (with a stuffed crow on his head) was based on a painting by Kirby Sattler called I Am Crow (Google it).

If you like movies like The Mask of Zorro (1998), the underrated The Musketeer (2001), the Indiana Jones flicks and the aforementioned Little Big Man youll probably appreciate The Lone Ranger. It's superior to any of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" flicks IMHO and I find Tonto far more interesting character than Jack Sparrow.

The film runs 150 minutes and was shot Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, California and Texas.

It has an okay story line that keeps you interested in seeing it through to the end with some action scenes that kept you going.

It's fun and a bit over the top but I enjoy it more with each viewing.

This movie is Johnny Depp's attempt to bring his pirate character onto dry land.  It is a total romp for him.  His relationship with the Lone Ranger and his remarks to the Lone Ranger are at moments hilarious.  The movie is way too long.  Could easily lose a half to three-quarters of an hour, (mostly horses pounding over sandy terrain), but overall, this is a masterpiece--certain to live long in the annals of black humor (i.e. Rocky Horror Show).

However, do not let that fool you; this is a MUCH more up to date version. 21 Jumpstreet, the TV show, gave us Johnny Depp who stars in this movie and is an internationally known actor. This modern western has all the comic book feel yet with gunfights, explosions, and high speed horse chases. The train race scene(s) are THE BEST TRAIN RACE scenes I have ever seen! I MEAN IT. This movie is action packed, Old West style, with a masked man called The Lone Ranger and his partner, Tonto. This movie has a little of everything to offer in violence, comedy, and action. Tonto brings most of the comedy but is tough when he needs to be. Rated PG-13 for violence and innuendo. Enjoy!",1457136000,,841,4.467532467532467

I'm not really a Johnny Depp fan in general, but I liked him in this.  I also liked Armie Hammer a great deal, and thought the interplay between them was very entertaining.

5821471,2,B00DJYJWVW,"As one who grew up watching ""The Lone Ranger"" on TV, I thought this movie was rather silly, with inappropriate humor and outlandish feats.  The ending was exciting if you can believe that the hero could ride his horse along the top of a moving train with bullets flying... No thanks.  I'll stick with the memories of the Lone Ranger and Tonto I saw on TV as a youngster.  (BTW, the music was excellent, but that did little to make up for the levity of the story and characters)...  To see a great Native American movie with an heroic white man, watch ""Broken Arrow"" with James Stewart and Jeff Chandler (as Cochise).  Now, THERE'S a movie!",1456531200,2,639,4.474137931034483

Johnny Depp was excellent in it, all questions of ""should Depp be playing a native american"" aside (I think he handled it well, but the role really should have been filled by a member of the First Nation). The other actor, who's name escapes me (Hammer?) was ok but not amazing.

Depp (droll) and Hammer (priggish) were a good duo, using excellent comic timing. And one thing I really appreciated was there was no long drawn out duel scene with the baddies,.. just an amazing chase and a great end.

5821599,4,B00DJYJWVW,"The flaw of this movie is that it's too long. The Mexican standoff is WAY too long. Some of the action scenes (especially the end) is WAY too long. It slows things down. It's like the producer fell in love with the effects and couldn't dream of cutting a moment. As a result, the movie goes on for 2.5 hours. It could make its point with more bang in less time. Other than that, it's great!

I was not upset at all with the depiction of the natives. First of all, it's a movie. Second, I think it told many truths that are more palatable because it is cloaked in humor. You can't see the brutality without being impacted by it no matter how much you are laughing at other things.

I am not familiar with the original Lone Ranger, but this relationship works for me. I think it makes it more human, more interesting, and provides more of a backstory than ""these are nice people who are motivated by good to do good."" Heroes sometimes bumble about. They are often quirky. They aren't godlike creatures 100% of the time -especially at the beginning of their journey. I think it's a hopeful view of the Lone Ranger and Tonto.

The scenery was incredible. It makes me want to find that place and visit. The action is original, fast paced, and fun. The writing is brilliant. I laughed out loud a few times and I do not do that. The acting is very good. Johnny Depp is so versatile. Gotta love him! It's perfectly cast. I'm so glad I took a chance on this. A good movie makes you think and/or feel something. This movie did both. :)",1452211200,2,1525,4.306620209059234
5821600,5,B00DJYJWVW,awesome thank you so much,1452124800,,25,4.2
5821601,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Strangely enough, this movie reminds me of Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter. Not because of plot -- there are NO similarities, not because of the characters either -- nothing in common there. They are similar because both movies understand that the Wild West, the Gunslinger, the Loner who saves the day -- these are and always were myths, stories that had nothing to do the reality of plains life: hard, back-breaking work lasting years that could be wiped out a few months of disastrous weather, disease, hunger -- no glamor there to be found. The Western was written for the city slickers back East that dreamed of adventure and that promised something more in their lives than wage-slavery. So for all those reviewers who complain about 2013 movie not being true to the original story, HINT!! -- there never was any ""original"" story, the original story was just as made up out of fantasy as those penny novels that sold so well in the 1880s about the ""Wild West"". So get over it.

That said, there are authentic villains in the movie who are just active today as they were back then: villains whose grasping, clutching greed will destroy everything they touch, including the land, because these robber barons can never get enough. Today it's clear-cutters, frackers, miners -- they steal all they can and leave desolation behind. While tycoon Latham Cole may have gotten his comeuppance in the movie, and maybe Butch Cavendish was not his biological brother, they were brothers all the same, at heart, and that race of brothers lives on today.

In the face of such evil, we need myths -- stories and legends that will inspire us to face the evil. That's why Johnny Depp's last line was: ""up to you"".  Is the story of The Lone Ranger, Tonto really true? ""Up to you""

So I find this movie a serious treatment of the myth of the West.

About the movie itself, its style, pacing, cinematography: it is a rip-roaring ride. That keeps it up for 2.5 hours. There are too many movies that drag after 15 minutes. Plenty of humor, some sly, some witty, some slap-stick. It has got it all. And Depp excels in each aspect. And there is the serious side, the Indian chief's statement: we are already ghosts. Pretty amazing for what could be taken as a mere summer popcorn movie. And the last stand of Commanche as the movie shows it (not meant to the most factual, but the most true) will haunt you after the ending credits have rolled by. Plot twists, wild chase scenes that keep you on seat's edge, uncertain romance. Hubris, vanity, greed. Even character growth: Armie Hammer's John Reed (the Lone Ranger) undergoes a painful, tentative transformation of growing up away from a dopey, smug idealism to the reality of an adult.

I also appreciate the several times the movie criticized itself, breaking the flow through the sceptical questions of young boy-cowboy Will (Mason Cook) who not sure what to believe. Those moments (aside from the mischievous humor implied) brought me back to the movie theater: it's just a movie, use it for Escapism, hero worship, or maybe something else.

It's a much better movie than the critics would have you believe.  It's fun and entertaining.  The action sequences are amazing, and it takes a lot of work and detail to put together a period piece this authentic.

5821654,4,B00DJYJWVW,"I now the critics panned this movie for many reasons. Johnny Depp not being Native American, the use of some of the language, etc., but I enjoyed it. It was fun and fast-paced, and I'm sorry, but I enjoyed the repartee between Tonto and the Ranger. Anyone who saw the original show or watched it in reruns would enjoy this. It stayed true to the original show, but put in some background and some comedy that were absent previously.

5821710,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Immensely better than ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" from 1981 which tried to play it straight, based off of the earlier radio and TV series. I consider this to be a suitable 21st century re-imagining, with a bit more cultural sensitivity and the use of Tonto as a three dimensional character rather than a living prop. I don't really think that Helan Bonham-Carter's character was needed, nor was the bordello/saloon scene. I just don't think the plot was advanced with it, and the movie was a bit longer because of it.  I did enjoy seeing the little easter eggs  from other films they scattered through this movie.",1446076800,,617,4.703703703703703
5821711,4,B00DJYJWVW,"This certainly wasn't the ""Lone Ranger"" on TV when I grew up .  I liked it.  It was funny.",1446076800,,90,3.6842105263157894

5821713,3,B00DJYJWVW,"When The Lone Ranger was released I was eager to see it but there was a lot of criticism saying the movie was a bit confusing. I told myself I would wait for it to be available at home. I watched it last week, I liked it, but they were right there does seem to be a lot of unresolved issues in how this story was to be told. After watching it the viewer walks away wondering what it is he has seen and what it was the producer was trying to do.

I think it was supposed to be intellectually humorous... Tonto was supposed to have wisdom laced with irony - sometimes it worked, most of the time it didn't. The Ranger was supposed to be less than a hero, transformed into the archetypical western hero - yeah, well, kinda-sorta, maybe. It was supposed to develop a bond between the characters and the audience, origin stories that would help you identify with them and that worked... Tonto's backstory was unique (for me) and the Ranger's ride into a vicious trap that cost the lives of seven men (including his brother) helped us feel his obsession for justice. But the lasting effect of these elements ""burst"" as the confusing slap-stick elements of the film poked at the bubbles of connection and seriously threatened the viewer's suspension of disbelief. There is some really good stuff in the movie leaving the viewer, afterwards, feeling like he had a really exciting dream that now seems absurd.",1445558400,2,1400,4.533596837944664

I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not a fan of Depp off the stage, but he played the type of character he is good at. Sort of Pirates of the Lone Ranger, if you will.",1445212800,,337,4.121212121212121

5821719,5,B00DJYJWVW,I know it's only rated at 3 1/2 stars but I found it hilarious and very very entertaining. I watched Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger and Jay Silverheels as Tonto back in the 50s. I have a soft spot for the characters (although Johnny Depp didn't look much like the original Tonto.) Funny funny funny,1445212800,,300,4.375
5821720,3,B00DJYJWVW,"The mistake made here was the iconic titular character, The Lone Ranger, was the second banana and Tonto, who traditionally was Second banana, was played as the hero.  You don't do that .  They should have called it ""Tonto"".  No one wants to see The Lone Ranger played as a buffoon. Having said that, I have a huge crush on Armie Hammer who deserves much much better.  Johnny Depp needs a vacation.",1445040000,,398,4.486111111111111

Tonto is made the  central character played by Johnny Depp, with his usual weird take. Spoiler alert: a central villain in the movie has been made a cannibal. Yes, you heard it right. A cannibal. This is definitely not a film for little children.  like too many movies now days, the first half of the film is showing the origin of the main character, which only seems to take up time.

Horrible sound effects, poor visuals, apart from some scenes in Monument Valley, there was nothing else but poor acting. I wonder if the state of Arizona is ashamed to have had those clowns prancing around its beautiful surroundings. Depp is now over the edge to behave like a fool in silly costumes.

But I never really knew the story of how the Lone Ranger became a masked man or how he and Tonto got together. I now finally at this age know all of that. A lot of critics did not like this movie. Perhaps they did not like Johnny Depps success with the Pirates of The Caribbean. I thought this movie was great and was amazed at what they
went through to get ready for it such as making 5 miles of train track and making an engine for the train and passenger train cars which faithfully reproduced the originals from that time period. I also liked having the bonus content and with this edition came a Blue-Ray and regular DVD which I could let a friend borrow who did not have a Blue-Ray player.

5821771,4,B00DJYJWVW,"There are a bunch of run of the mill, low quality action movies out there. The Lone Ranger remake isn't one of them. It has convincing acting, a great story, awesome action scenes, and an ending only fitting of an action movie. Good guys put aside their differences to kick evil butt and come out on top.

The humor in this movie was good, but seemed out of place. I'm not certain it was originally in the screen play it seems so wrenched in at times. Tonto's lines are some of the funniest, but they sound more like something captain jack sparrow would say rather than a stoic Native American tracker.

I feel like this was supposed to be the start of a series of movies. I would not mind seeing the rest as they should develop the Lone Ranger's and Tonto's character's more. Hopefully they will fix the awkward humor as well.

All in all, worth watching, definitely better than transformers, and if you like the wild west, do see this movie. It is a plot that fits right into history and shades the consequences of greed darkly against the treatment of Native Americans.",1442448000,,1072,4.487179487179487

5821797,2,B00DJYJWVW,"We watched the Lone Ranger (2013) with johnny Depp and Armie Hammer this evening, and Im sort of stunned that Disney could do such a bad job with such an iconic story.

The story is told in flashback by an aged tonto who appears to have been stuck in a museum case since the late 1800s, cluing us into the supernatural elements of the film. See, the Lone Ranger concept made so little sense to the producers that they had to explain it away with mysticism and sarcastic humor. Johnny Dep had best hope that theres no truth in the notion of Tontos endurance, because if there is, then Jay Silverheels is bound to show up and whack him.

Perhaps I shouldnt be surprised. Disney botched John Carter of Mars pretty badly as well. And then theres the hyper-train wreck they made of (despite the fact I enjoyed it) Tomorrowland. Still, the only other property I can remember handled this badly was Starship Troopers, and Im pretty sure that both films suffered from the same issue, that being the studios unwillingness to stand behind what they were certain modern audiences would see as naive and outmoded values.

Its much easier to be an anti-hero than a good guy.

Not that Im immune to the whole bad is good meme. The inevitable white hat really did look weird in the middle of all that dust and grit, and pretty much everyone else got to wear a stylish black one.

Besides making fun of Tontos integrity and the Lone Rangers honor, which they really went out of the way to do, they failed on the most important aspect of the movie. The score.

Yes, we got a few seconds of the William Tell Overture here and there, but never enough, and at times a bit tongue in cheek. What was weird, though in perfect keeping with the directors sensibilities, was the obvious melodic references to The Good, The Bad, and The Uglys score.

Im a big fan of Ennio Morricones score for TGTB&TU, In fact, I think its one of the top ten sound tracks of all time, but the whole vibe was totally wrong for the Lone Ranger.

Although the producers felt it was fair game to mock the originals naivete, it was painful to watch our hero pull a gun on the badguys time and time again and refuse to shoot anyone, which would have saved a whole lot of trouble later on, but made him look pathetic. Of course, they made it clear that he wasn't actually a skilled shootist, but that Native American spiritualism was guiding his hand.

I know critics said it all two years ago, but I didn't want to believe it was as bad as they said.

Clayton Moore, the original Lone Ranger, and his faithful sidekick Tonto (Jay Silverheels) were the archetype for any number of dynamic duos, most notably Kirk and Spock, but also Napoleon Solo and Ilya Kuryakin, who get their own movie this summer. Its deeply ironic that Armie Hammer, who played the charismatic hero here, will be playing the Tonto role as Ilya Kuryakin in that movie. Fortunately, I think the director (Guy RItchie) gets The Man From U.N.C.L.E a lot more than Gore Verbinski did.

Many have taken exception to Tontos second banana status and portrayal of a Native American, but there was never any doubt in my mind as to who the brains of the outfit were, or which of the two deserved more respect, which is not to say the the man in the mask didn't deserve a heaping helping, because he did this film.

Its unfortunate that Disney couldn't show either the original actors or the story itself, some of that respect.",1441497600,,3438,4.47444089456869

Growing up, I watched the TV series, and loved it. I still catch episodes of it to this day and still like it, but for a much different reason than I did in 1950. Today it is ""campy"", nostalgic, corny, but comparing it to anything produced in today's world is just plain wrong. A Willys Overland and a Tesla, aside from the roundness of the tires, have little in common. The Tom Cruise franchise of Mission Impossible movies is nothing like the Peter Grave's television series.
People who expect to see an updated version of their 1950's memories will be disappointed. Thank goodness. The World of the 1950's, as seen on television never really did exist.
I really liked this movie. I thought the screenplay was done well and was honest to the original in that the Native Americans were wrongfully vilified and screwed around at every turn in the name of ""Progress"", which was really Greed. Some things never change. Never a big fan of Johnny Depp but I found him to be perfect in his role of Tonto. Can't think of anyone who could have portrayed such a weird character better.

5821926,3,B00DJYJWVW,"Johnny Depp kinds of ruins the Lone Ranger by being his typical humorless and obnoxious far-fetched self where viewers have to suspend disbelief just to watch his weird character on screen.  While this movie is certainly action/adventure, Johnny performing all kinds of outrageous fighting techniques as a way to take out the bad guys just didn't work for me.  It made his character weirder than it should've been for a movie like this.

The many fights that take place on trains were fun and filled with action, as were the gun fights with a tad more violence than I anticipated upon getting a feel for the movie (though the description was initially so vague I actually thought the Lone Ranger was going to be more along the lines of a typical western) Johnny Depp himself once again exaggerates and ruins the film.  The only movie I've seen where he's portrayed as fairly normal with a normal easy to follow storyline is Secret Window.  Everything else he stars in... meh.

Still, if you like the Indiana Jones type of action/adventure movies this is for you but I wanted more in the way of substance and strong memorable characters.  Not a cheesy exaggerated film where Johnny goes crazy beating people up dressed as a Native American.  He was the wrong person for the role.

5821949,2,B00DJYJWVW,"My first though of this movie is that it reminded me a lot of the Green Hornet remake - in other words, a remake that takes a classic hero (even more so in this case) and makes him into a bumbling idiot that only gets along through luck and the constant guidance of the sidekick.
After that, there are many other problems of varying degrees:
- The most cringe worthy is that the Lone Ranger's dead brother's widow is his love interest.
- Having the story told by and old Tonto.
- Tonto being insane.
-  A whorehouse and a madam with an ivory gun-leg that everyone wants to touch.
- All the talk about how it is wrong to shoot the bad guy, because that is not justice, yet having the bad guys get killed anyway because, clearly, that is what the movie thinks is their just end.
- The way that the Lone Ranger and Tonto do not even like each other.
- That fact that there is nothing intimidating whatsoever about the Lone Ranger.

5821951,3,B00DJYJWVW,"The Lone Ranger
 When I finished watching The Lone Ranger the audience broke into spontaneous applause.  And I did too.  We liked the movie for what it was, an often funny two and half hour long entertainment experience.  Johnny Depp as Tonto was a hoot, the movie was his and should perhaps have been titled Tonto.  The PG-13 rating might be a tad on the low side.  There was a good bit of fairly disturbing violence for a Disney film, so be warned.  The Comanche nation suffers some very serious casualties.  Most viewers will be uneasy seeing this.
 Director Gore Verbinski and two of the three writers are veterans of the Pirates of the Caribbean films, also featuring Johnny Depp in odd clothes and makeup.  The comparisons are natural and inevitable.  I may be among the view reviewers that will give The Long Ranger an average grade of three saw blades.  Most awards are lower.  I think that this reflects viewers expectations that after spending an estimated $250 million or more to make the film we should get something better than a middling good movie.
 Every moment that Depp is on screen, the film hums and glistens.  When the camera is off him, it drifts off into absurd excesses of spectacular special effects.  There is enough cool stuff to keep us interested however.  One of what I take as the strengths of the film is the nebulous way the Tonto character is written.  We open the film in the mid 1930s where a heavily made up Depp is Tonto as a very old man.  He tells the tale of the Lone Ranger to a young boy in a Lone Ranger outfit, mask, cap guns and all.  We never quite know if Tonto is an historian, a shaman or a nut job making it all up.
 I think he isn't an historian.  The specific facts of the story are not nearly as important as the saga itself.  Tonto explores what professors of literature might call Magic Realism in some of the sequences.  There is a Spirit Horse (Silver) who provides some odd moments but no conclusions.  I rather liked that whole idea.  Some stuff that didn't work so well are the extended sequences where the Lone Ranger and Silver ride along a moving train, sometimes on top of it and sometimes inside of it.  Magic Realism or not, it was just too much and too stupid to take.
 Ditto the whole character played by Helana Banham Carter.  She plays a prostitute with an artificial leg made of ivory in a role that adds very little to the story.  Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger is perhaps too tentative a hero, a man of thoughts propelled into becoming a man of action.  But Johnny Depp is wonderful, quirky, and perhaps mad in giving us a whole new Tonto to relish.",1432944000,,2624,4.426778242677824

5821986,3,B00DJYJWVW,"Gore Verbinski's The Lone Ranger is decidedly a mixed bag.  To be fair, it does have some great moments, which one would expect from the director and writers who made the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. To be equally fair though, there are even more ""What were they thinking?"" moments, as well as a number of action scenes where there was clearly plenty of money but not enough thought.

The film actually starts in a truly memorable and engaging way.  A young boy (Mason Cook) dressed in a Lone Ranger outfit, visiting a carnival in 1933 San Francisco wanders into a side-show tent where the Old West is portrayed in a series of life-sized dioramas, one of which, titled ""The Noble Savage"", has what seems to be a statue of an old Comanche Indian standing in front of his camp.  Except that it's not a statue, as the boy discovers when the statue suddenly looks at him. And begins to speak. We soon learn that the Indian is a very, very old Tonto (Johnny Depp). And he begins to tell his tale to his audience of one. And we listen along as well.  Unfortunately, the movie is unable to sustain that feeling of wonder for very long, descending all too soon and all too often into slapstick and farce.

There are a number of problems with The Lone Ranger, but first and foremost among them is Armie Hammer's Lone Ranger.  In fairness to Hammer (The Social Network, Mirror Mirror), most of this is not his fault as he was only doing what the script and the director were calling on him to do. Unfortunately for the film - and for us - that was to play the Lone Ranger as farce.  Hammer's Lone Ranger is an awkward, annoyingly naive, bumblingly clumsy lawyer, younger brother to Dan Reid (James Badge Dale), the kind of stoically valiant real Texas Ranger the original Lone Ranger of radio and TV legend was. So when he finally asks Depp's Tonto what ""Quimo Sabe"" means, it is fitting that Tonto grumpily replies ""Wrong Brother"".

There are a number of creditable performances in the film.  William Fichtner (Contact, Prison Break) is outstanding as Butch Cavendish, the outlaw responsible for John Reid's becoming the Lone Ranger. With his gaunt frame, scarred face, and quietly menacing way of speaking, Fichtner's Cavendish is just the kind of larger-than-life villain a film like this truly needs.  He is never more scary than when he's smiling.  James Badge Dale (World War Z, 24) is quietly effective as Dan Reid, a man who knows that his commitment to duty is taking a toll on his wife and young son. And, reminiscent of John Ford's classic The Searchers, knowing that his brother was the one that his wife (Ruth Wilson) truly loved.

Recommended for the good parts, but with the caution that one should not expect anything like the old epic radio & TV shows.",1429660800,,2763,4.60285132382892

5822013,4,B00DJYJWVW,"** WARNING: SPOILER AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW **

I don't see why this movie was universally panned as being one of the worst movies of 2013.  Maybe people expected the wrong things from it?

If you accept the movie for what it is, you can enjoy it as a fun romp with a western backdrop.  Don't listen to the naysayers.  It's not ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"", but it's not ""Heaven's Gate"" either.

It's a light-hearted take on the Lone Ranger story.  Yes, Johnny Depp looks silly with the dead bird on his head and the explanation for it is not entirely adequate.  Yes, Armie Hammer will never be mistaken for Clayton Moore or for a real Texas Ranger for that matter.

The movie though, is full of adventure and action.  The characters are likable if quirky, and even though the movie is overly long, it's always interesting and worthwhile.  Playing the Lone Ranger theme song over the climactic action sequences was a stroke of genius in my opinion, and lends that extra bit of excitement that makes the movie more than just mediocre.

If the plot twists and action sequences seem improbable, I refer you to the end of the movie, when the child asks the aging Tonto character if the story he's just told is really true.  Tonto replies, ""If you want it to be.""

The Lone Ranger is a good movie--if  you want it to be.  If you don't nitpick and allow yourself to be entertained--you will be.",1427414400,2,1395,4.411764705882353

5822072,3,B00DJYJWVW,"The Lone Ranger wasn't that bad.  It had very strong actors in the likes of Johnny Depp and Tom Wilkinson.  Also, Armie Hammer made an excellent Lone Ranger.

Where this movie fell off the horse (no pun intended) was via direction and continuity which is a shame because Disney could have had a hit like Zorro (of Antonio Banderas fame) on it's hands instead of a major flop.

All the actors in The Lone Ranger did a fine job, however.  I was super skeptical about Johnny Depp playing Tonto as I was nervous about the whole 'black/brown-face' issue (white actor playing a character who is supposed to be non-white), but he pulled it off nicely!  If it had been done in any other way, it could have been a travesty and viewed as extremely prejudicial  kudos to Johnny Depp for his great work there.

The beginning of the movie was extremely slow and quite boring.  It was just off... and again, it wasn't due to the acting.  As the middle progressed, it got better and the end is fun and exciting.

This movie had so much potential.  Still, it is worth seeing at least once to judge for yourself.  lol",1425168000,,1100,4.44

The main problem with this film is the change in tone from light to dark- still, it doesn't bother too much. Good cinematography, creepy villains, wacky, lovable heroes, good acting, plenty of humor, lots of incredible action sequences, good artistic direction. It is respectful to the characters and even has a wonderful score by Hans Zimmer, who is one of my favorite -composers. Not hugely mature, but definitely PG-13.

5822140,4,B00DJYJWVW,"The Lone Ranger remake has gotten mixed-to-bad reviews.  This is no surprise, since the film appears to be confused in what it is trying to do.  The general ethos of the film is comic, but not comic in the way that the Adam West Batman shows were comic.  The story itself is quite serious and there is violence aplenty, some of it gross (cannibalism, e.g.).  Thus, it appears to be a mish-mash that doesn't understand what it's about.

The story itself is framed by the interactions of a small boy with an aging Tonto, who is part of a set (""The Noble Savage"") in a 1933 Wild West Museum.  Tonto and the boy talk and Tonto basically tells him the story of the lone ranger.  This takes two and a half hours.  The man who will become the lone ranger comes to a town in Texas as a newly-minted lawyer (with clear echoes of the far more serious position of Jimmy Stewart in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, one of the 3 or 4 greatest westerns of all time).  This man's brother is a Texas Ranger and the lawyer brother is drawn into joining a posse of rangers, all of whom are killed but him.

The story explains the man's donning of a mask and it offers a `role' for the silver mine which--in the standard version--is the source of the lone ranger's materiel for his silver bullets, etc.  The secret location of the silver mine and the course taken by the railroad are all related and they are linked to an event in the early life of Tonto, sometimes played with a straight face (certainly as a youth), but most often played comically by Johnny Depp.  The villain/antagonist is, as so often in Hollywood, a businessman, played by Tom Wilkinson.  In some cases he is truly scary, in others he verges on Snidely Whiplash, as when he shoots Stephen Root (who plays the judge in Justified who wears nothing but speedos beneath his black robes) in the buttock.

Many have noted the similarities in tone between this film and the Pirates of the Caribbean films (which, now, share a common director and producer).  Still and all, the plot of this film is quite serious, even if the tone is not consistently so.  At times it is downright wacky, as in the appearance of Helena Bonham Carter as a western madam named Red, who has replaced her missing leg with an ivory prosthesis which has been used for scrimshaw art and which contains a gun which shoots through the base of her shoe when the heel is mechanically retracted.  Suddenly we're in the world of The Wild, Wild West.

Thus, $215,000,000 in production costs are thrown at the screen in a Hollywood extravaganza.  Nevertheless, it's fun.  The scenes, particularly in Monument Valley, are stunning.  The final chase scene involving dueling railroads is monumental in itself.  Depp is screwy throughout but still charming and sweet.  Finally, when the orchestra strikes up the William Tell Overture, we cannot help but smile broadly and wish all the best to the man in the white hat and mask and his companion with the dead crow tiara.

Bottom line:  a strange, even weird film that ended up being quite enjoyable.  (And the bloopers included in the 'added features' are well worth seeing.)",1422576000,3,3135,4.573476702508961

I take it for what it is worth . But it was simply nothing I could say was good. Ok is all it is . Glad I seen it , but wouldnt watch it again for a good long time . Once is enough as it was a good idea gone bad with the awful changes to the fabric of both the Lone Ranger and Tonto. They don't resemble at all the purpose filled strong characters I seen as a kid.

I allowed myself to become deeply involved with Johnny Depp's excellent comic yet dramatic portrayal of his relationship with the man who would become the Lone Ranger. Arne Hammer was splendid in his role as the masked lawman, superb as were all of the actors in this, for me at least a highly recommended pass-along to all of you in cyberspace.

5822202,1,B00DJYJWVW,"If you never heard of the Lone Ranger, or are younger and never saw the TV Series (live or reruns) then you may find this ""western version of Pirates of the Caribbean"" enjoyable.  Johnny Depp does his usual odd character excellently, but that is about the limit of the charm of this film.

Ask someone older ""who is the Lone Ranger?"" and they will say he's a Texas Ranger who had his posse ambushed and was the sole survivor.  Found by an Indian named Tonto, they set up shop in an abandoned silver mine and go town to town righting wrongs.  The Lone Ranger is an expert shot with the silver bullets he makes at the mine.  He wears a mask to protect his identity.

That's not this film.

Here he's a lawyer who dislikes guns, Tonto hates the guy and the horse Silver is the 2nd best actor in the film.  Took nearly an hour before our title character actually fired a gun (he missed).  It's almost like they REALLY wanted this to be a straight up comedy, but failed at that too.  Basically everything they could get wrong about the character they did.  It's not a comedy, as the laughs are spares and feel forced.  It's not a western as it doesn't take the source material seriously.  This oddball of a movie bombed at the theater for a reason.  Older audiences hated it for not following the Lone Ranger lore and younger audiences (who currently don't care about westerns) didn't find enough humor to enjoy it.

If Johnny Depp wasn't in the movie, this would be a movie bomb that would of faded quickly into the background.  Even his star power has its limits.",1420070400,5,1560,4.4020979020979025

5822247,5,B00DJYJWVW,"This wonderful fantasy brings the Lone Ranger and Tonto into the twenty first century. Putting a relevant spin on the innocent charm of the original, extensive research went into location, Native American spirituality, genocide, government greed, and corporate corruption in the last stage of the ""old west."" Tonto is a shaman in search of a man in a vision who will help him avenge those massacred in a brutal raid on his village. The soon to be ""Lone Ranger"" is the man in that vision. Tonto is none too thrilled with his protege. A reluctant hero, the Lone Ranger loses his brother to the same killers. Here the film is off and running on a cinematic version of Disneyland's Big Thunder Mountain. Johnny Depp shines as Tonto (even down to actual Native American headgear). Armie Hammer is a riot as the inevitably heroic masked man. If you are a ""traditional"" Lone Ranger fan, you probably will hate this movie. But if you're not...

Now I would like those 2-1/2 hours back!  Not even my low expectations were met!  Tonto was an Indian version of Jack Sparrow.  The Lone Ranger lacked depth as a character.

The biggest issue was that there was too much Indian/Tonto stuff.  The name is the Lone Ranger, meaning he is supposed to be the main character not Tonto.

5822263,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Watched the second half of the first run and caught the first half of the original episodes on Saturday morning television. At 65, still catch the original series from time to time (on FETV).

After a brief scan of negative reviews, the most-legitimate knocks seem based on this version not being advertised as an adult fantasy version. It is easy to agree this version has  more going on than most children can digest. Taking that thought a step further,  this version might have a little more going on than a lot of Americans can digest. This version references Locke and offers existential framing of the corruption that underwrote the American West.

The original series also traded heavily on corruption among apparently decent people. It is easy to remember watching crooked bankers and storekeepers be exposed then captured by The Lone Ranger and Tonto. About as frequently, a character who might have gone wrong is inspired by The Lone Ranger and Tonto to commit to better behavior going forward. What made the original series work for parents was how well the original series captured the fears and hopes of the period.

In my opinion, this version is to the original series what the movie 'Apocalypse Now' was to Vietnam (and to a lesser degree to Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness'), which is an existential-fantasy point of reference. A particular strong point of the movie is the long, disciplined delay before introducing the William Tell Overture. Everything in the movie up to that point seemed developmental, then, there he was: The Lone Ranger, offering hope again, only this time more obviously in a world of scat, which widened points of reference for me at least.

As to The Lone Ranger's faithless companion, Tonto? Pretty incredible as far as I am concerned. Having seen any number of old timers traveling around backwoods Appalachia in the 1950s making a living off fantasies of one sort or another, it is my opinion that the scenes with the boy in the amusement park are among the most compelling existential contrasts in my experience in movies in recent years. The headpiece and proclivity for dropping seeds here and there humanized Tonto, probably the greatest failure of the original series.

The weakest part of the movie for me was the same sort of over-the-top jackhammer ending that diminished (for me) the ends of any number of otherwise great movies in recent years. In consideration with the rest of the movie's special effects there is also the reality that sudden extreme violence IS disorderly and surreal and IS hard to make sense of in real time. The possibility that over-the-top special effects might have been intended to reflect the craziness of luck and violence made those scenes work for me.

I'll stop on this note: this version of The Lone Ranger is not for everyone. I loved it because it took me back to times and places always in the back of my mind but rarely reviewed, and did it in ways that made the good nostalgic and represented the bad without inflicting discomfort.",1417910400,3,3021,4.863813229571984

So, you know, really good cheese. Johnny Depp mugs like a goofball, and the Lone Ranger himself is kind of an idiot savant. The over-the-top situations and special effects reminded me of the old Wild Wild West TV show. My much older parents enjoyed it even more than I did.

5822270,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Ah, expectations -- they can ruin a movie for someone expecting a great experience or come as a pleasant surprise to someone expecting to be disappointed. As a film critic for over 25 years, I often found myself a victim of my own preconceived notions, but not, I believe, in the case of this splendid work of entertainment. Yes, there was a very negative buzz on this movie, which caused me to put off watching it -- even though I was originally looking forward to its release. Part of my reluctance was because of the treatment Britt Reid (great nephew of Lone Ranger John Reid) received in ""The Green Hornet."" As ""Legend of the Lone Ranger"" more than amply attested, a straight version of the origin of this iconic character is difficult, if not impossible to pull off. Fran Striker's creation was meant for a simpler time. Enter the amazing Johnny Depp. Adding just the right comic edge to his portrayal of Tonto and a wonderfully deadpan delivery of some truly hilarious lines, he IS the movie's focal point -- both as narrator and its moral center. Armie Hammer is a perfect straight man and stoic, albeit somewhat dense, hero. His journey from zero to hero is a tour-de-force of acting, writing and directing. The rest of the cast is pitch perfect and the framing device -- of a young boy encountering the elderly Tonto in a museum -- aids in our willing suspension of disbelief. No spoof has packed this much entertainment into its running time since ""Young Frankenstein"" and, at almost 2 1/2 hours, that's really saying something!",1417305600,3,1539,4.703703703703703

It's also very long, at two and a half hours, but the action scenes and humor make it so it doesn't drag. Johnny Depp as Tonto really carries the film. The opening device, which continues at intervals, and finally ends the movie, of Tonto with a small boy in a western museum, set far in the future from the rest of the film, could have been eliminated.

5822288,2,B00DJYJWVW,"The Lone Ranger is a Western action film and a Bruckheimer/Disney remake of the same title on a radio series back in the 1930's. This is narration of Tonto's memories of his and the Longer Ranger's early efforts to subdue the criminal activities of the corrupt and bring them to justice during the time of the American Old West.

The story started when John Reid, a man of the law, transformed himself to becoming the Lone Ranger, a masked hero. Pairing up with an unlikely Native American spirit warrior Tonto, together they brought criminals, lawless and deviants into justice particularly bank robbers. It exhibits their adventures together as well as their humorous friction to stop the corrupt in the West.

Too bad that this remake is definitely lifeless, boring and very frustrating as the studio thought that bringing Johnny Depp and featuring the Lone Ranger and Tonto are enough to make a good movie. Too bad that it is no longer the case. The writers never tried to make it interesting nor made an update for the modern audiences as it stuck mainly to what both characters were in the 1930's.

When it was released, they had a quite biased opinion when they sat down to watch and then just ran with that. Disgusting.

Fortunately for me, I give little credence to film critics and I pay them little mind. I absolutely love just about everything in this film. I saw in twice in the theaters and just now at home on BluRay and each time I watch it, I like it better. A near-perfect blend of action, pathos, good-guys, most excellent bad guys, cinematography, and well-placed and well performed humor. The ""Hi-Yo Silver, away!"" ""Don't ever do that again!"" moment, alone, was priceless.

A near-centenarian Tonto's telling of the story to a little boy was a brilliant idea and gave warmth and (more) fun to the movie. Depp, as always, absolutely made this movie with his bubble-off-plumb take on Tonto. Hammer was solid as the Lone Ranger, and William Fichtner as a nasty, nasty Butch Cavendish was evil incarnate. Even Tom Wilkinson as Latham Cole, the more polished bad guy, was wonderfully evil. There was not a piece of bad casting in the film that I could identify.

It was nice that they paid some homage to the Clayton Moore/Jay Silverheels version of the Lone Ranger but they built their own story, and it's a doozy!!

My advice to anyone considering this film is this: Absolutely ignore the critics, sit down with no expectations of a 1950's Lone Ranger, fire this puppy up and just enjoy a rollicking, fun, funny and action packed visit to the old west. You won't regret it, Kemosabe!!!",1414972800,4,1763,4.584126984126984

I went into this not expecting much, which was good, because I wasn't disappointed.

I found Johnny Depp to be quite enjoyable in the movie.  I always enjoy his performances and this was no different.  Although, on more than one occasion it felt like Captain Jack Sparrow was pretending to be a Comanche....  (the characters were a little too similar at times).

Armie Hammer....  eh.  Forgettable performance.  I didn't really like how the movie made his character a dolt.  Basically, a naive wimp for most of the movie.  It didn't do much for the movie, in my opinion.  But, Armie played the wimp character well.  (Very wimpily).

The pacing was a little uneven.  Some spots dragged.  Others worked well.

The action sequences were also uneven.  Sometimes they worked, sometimes not so much.

Lastly, the tone was a bit uneven.  It had serious themes, which was fine.  And, it had humor.  Which was fine.  But, the compositing of the serious vs. humor was sometimes awkward or even inappropriate.  (Specific scene that comes to mind is the line at the end of the scene where the entire Comanche tribe is murdered, bodies in the water, and Johnny Depp's character closes the scene with a joke about the dumb horse.  It was,... in appropriate, at best.

So, overall, it was mildly entertaining.
Mildly.
Johnny Depp's performance saved the film.  Without him, it would have most likely been a complete dud.",1414454400,,1414,4.811715481171548
5822324,1,B00DJYJWVW,"WARNING TO PARENTS : This is Disney yet it features Cannibalism , Prostitution ,  reference to Anal violation , Drinking,Drug Opium use,  killing, a train robbery scene that is violent ( several men bust in to a train filled with Christians and when a old woman cannot get her wedding ring off enough one of the robbers goes to cut off her finger etc) Killing with no reason , I could go on, it is just terrifying to see what the bloated Disney machine is putting out there for young people. ( Walt himself might object to it even though he  helped the government spy on u.s citizens anyway)

As for the story the ""lone ranger"" character  is just going to upset you. He is written as a naive city boy that is actually kind of dumb. Tonto is the smart one but everyone thinks he is crazy. The story is about the cross country railroad and the greedy, blood thirsty men behind  it  and how the Indians suffered ( the Chinese make a cameo , but just a tiny one)  and the powerful men used the military to kill innocent Indians. Pretty heavy stuff by itself but that part is educational .  The beginning and end is sad , showing Tonto in a side show old and wrinkled and in the end he walks off by himself with nothing but a suitcase in his hand. Bu they try to put a ""magical"" spin on it as he walks off in to a painting. Possibly a metaphor for the state of the Indians today, they have nothing because of men (that were not even the first to come to this country). The lone ranger  , well we do not know what happened to him in old age.
Not a good movie for kids but do read something of the real history of the u.s with your children and the plight of the original people who lived here before the white man came and stole their land. Also how the Chinese were treated..ugh it is all so sad but with this movie I find myself liking Disney less and less.",1414454400,,1853,4.1364902506963785

The movie does constantly jump back and forth between characters, leaving the audience to wonder who the protagonist is (main character). Johnny Depp really pulls you into the story while Hammer pushes you away - which is to be expected as they are polar opposites in the beginning. Until they combine as one does the story really take off with a bang.
This is a movie unlike any other and doesn't follow basic storyline plot points leaving the viewers to really gasp when something big happens in the movie. The acting is superb and with Depp it did get a little funny here and there. Though the movie is mainly adventure and action with a touch of suspense. The only romance you'll really find is bromance.

Rating:  PG13

Actors:  Johnny Depp, Armie Hammer
Time:  149 minutes

I should have known that any movie by Jerry Bruckheimer would contain significant violence, ghastly carnage, and bizarre gore.

However, I was shocked that the film was actually produced for children by Disney.
The content is extremely violent.  There are several scenes where the major protagonist mutilates his living victim and eats his heart whilst his murderous, cross-dressing, and hardened companions look on in horror.

The movie is riddled with several of his victims who want justice for loosing limbs to the cannibalistic antagonist.  The reluctant Lone Ranger plays second fiddle to the secondary character Tonto.  Hammer plays quite the cowardly ranger who refuses to succumb to violence.  This is strange since the entire movie is just that--caulk full of violence, gore, and dead animals.

The film has a humanistic universal message that gets lost in the violence.  The film is not appropriately rated.  It is important for adults to preview films, even those produced by Disney, prior to allowing young children to view.

This is Johnny Depp as himself.  He plays the film close to the edge much like his earlier gory pirate film.  He's the same strange over the top character, but just donning a different costume.  Further, Depp as a Native American doesn't play well here.  Really, Disney couldn't locate a single authentic Native American Actor for this lead.

Here is a list of content specifics that Bruckheimer and Disney have produced for PG13:

 Violence
 Dead Animals

Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer present outstanding performances.  They work very well together and definitely have a chemistry between them. The makeup was exceptional: I did not recognize several actors due to the makeup they wore. The special affects were also awesome. I applaud all who were involved in the creation of this wonderful movie 10 fold....

This is not your parent's and grandparent's Lone Ranger. So don't expect it!  It's a whole lot better!!! There is a lot of action and the movie never drags. The film provides a history of how the Lone Ranger came to be and how he and Tonto met. I just as much loved the filming of Tonto walking ""home"" among the stunning monoliths of Monument Valley: very creative.

The critics are fools for not liking this movie and it is Disney Studios fault for not advertising and not supporting this spectacular creation.  Shame on them. The movie is extremely entertaining, the locations in the 4 corners area provide superb staging. I've seen this movie well over 50 times already plus I have 4 Lone Ranger DVD's  (yes DVD's do wear out).  I was very sad to learn (out of Disney Studios stupidity) that there will be no sequel.

5822402,1,B00DJYJWVW,"First , for all those old enough to remember the TV series, this film does not even come close to showing respect for the qualities that made the TV series so popular. .

This movie really should use a different title and not try to capitalize on a cherished TV classic where violence was minimal with the Lone Ranger never purposefully killing anyone.

 This is now a 'revisionist"" Lone Ranger that is setting right the wrongs done to the native American Indians. Nothing wrong about that but why use it in this context. The Lone Ranger was already ahead of his time by having his best friend an Indian. The original Lone Ranger was about bringing criminals to justice with the help of his friend and partner Tonto. it was simple and sometimes simple can be good as well as just plain fun.

Like a lot of modern art there is a focus on the bizarre (e.g. Tonto is played in a ""bizarre way"" by Johnny Depp (whom I do like greatly, but not in this role) and that certainly exists here. Also, like so many American films these days the humour is just not funny.

Don't waste your time or money.

5822403,5,B00DJYJWVW,Even though there is a surprising amount of gore and violence (this is a DISNEY movie?) we still think it's a great flick.,1410998400,3,122,4.3478260869565215

5822405,4,B00DJYJWVW,"""The Lone Ranger"" shot itself in the foot with ads that made it look like a noisy, stupid film. And downright silly. (Why is a dead bird perched on Tonto's head?) Too many critics saw what they expected to see -- that the emperor was naked, even though well-dressed (if only in sportswear). This led to a general trashing. But if you pass up ""The Lone Ranger"", you'll be missing 2.5 hours of great popular movie-making.

Jerry Bruckheimer set himself a difficult task -- reimagining the Lone Ranger, while simultaneously poking fun at the material without disrespecting it. That he largely succeeds is remarkable.

This isn't to say ""The Lone Ranger"" doesn't have problems. The major one is that John Reid is too much the comic nebbuch. There's nothing wrong with this at the beginning (the discovery of one's hidden strengths is part of The Hero's Journey), but the story waits too long to show a significant shift in his character. The humor sometimes goes over the top, most notably in a scene with Red (a madam), where Reid flashes his Texas Ranger badge and warns Red about possible health violations in her bordello (!!!), including a questionable bottle of unrefrigerated pickles (Tonto's contribution to the argument). Fortunately, this is the only humor that truly gets out of hand.

On the positive side, there is much to praise. The action sequences are spectacular, played for both thrills and laughs, poking fun at action-film conventions. The dramatic elements are handled seriously. And Tonto is no longer the ""faithful companion"", but the principal actor. Like Salieri in ""Amadeus"", Tonto narrates the story. And like Salieri, he is not a reliable narrator, coloring his tale to make John Reid look like a ""stupid white man"". (His hatred of whites -- especially stupid ones -- is so strong, he even tries to bury the still-living Reid.)

This adds conflict the original version lacked. We also see the story from an aboriginal perspective, especially the spiritual. As crazy as Tonto is (he's a damaged soul), we gain respect for a character that was previously little more than a sidekick. But John Reid has the last laugh, with a poke at Tonto the writers must have found irresistible.

Not surprisingly, the plot is the populist ""wealthy people are the biggest threat to society"" story that fuels so many Westerns. Given this country's movement towards theocratic plutocracy, we can't have //enough// films attacking the church and the wealthy. But populism is so much a part of the traditional Western, most viewers won't notice. It's significant that Reid ultimately defines himself and Tonto as outlaws working against ""the system"".

As for the PG-13 rating... This is a violent film, but generally lacking in gore (other than the director). However, when Butch Cavendish cuts out the heart of the still-living Dan Reid, even adults will squirm. One might argue this justifies an R rating.",1410998400,3,2911,4.991752577319588

I almost never agree with them, but this time I heard it was a bomb at the box office and didn't buy the movie--boy am I glad I finally did.  I absolutely loved this story.  I was not the least bit surprised by the humor because the trailers presented before it released  clearly showed that there would be humor, and plenty of it.  What is wrong with humor?  In this story yes, some scenes are very fantastical.  Who doesn't like a super hero???  But aside from all of that, there is a great story and a large amount of truth in the movie, made bearable by the doses of humor.  The truth I speak of is the unspeakable atrocities done to the Indians during the time when the west was becoming inhabited by white settlers.  So many misunderstandings or flat out lies being spread resulting in unwarrented violence towards the Indians.  This movie moved me to laugh so much and also to cry many times.  It's a roller coaster of ups and downs.  Of course this movie was not based on the old Lone Ranger series of the 50's,  again, you could have guessed that from the trailers.  It goes without even mentioning but I will say it anyway,  Johnny Depp did a great job.",1409616000,,1289,4.326359832635983

Depp's performance steals the show, of course, and is wonderful to behold.  The story sags a bit in the middle, but the last 30 minutes are a joy to behold.  The Lone Ranger ""Theme"" (Bethoven, I think?) thunders, and the chase is on!  I just loved it.",1409616000,,366,4.569230769230769

My guess is that the people reviewing the movie either didn't see it, or had some notion in their mind of the original ""Lone Ranger"" tv series that this movie didn't live up to. As opposed to the last Pirates movie, where the director essentially threw the actors on the stage while the tape was running, it looked like they actually tried in this movie. I thought it was entertaining from beginning to end and I would watch it again. It's certainly not the best movie ever, but summer blockbusters don't regularly win Oscars either. If you are looking to be entertained, this movie will fit the bill. If you've seen the trailer, you know exactly what to expect.

The production values are generally excellent: apt directing, stunning cinematography. Some of the dialogue is unintelligible. The Blu-ray quality is superb.

Essentially they tried to do an ""origin story"" making the Lone Ranger a weakling for 90 minutes, which was annoying.  The Lone Ranger was a tough guy even before he was left for dead because he was a TEXAS FRICKING RANGER.  Everyone knows this, and everyone has an image of the Lone Ranger as a tough guy, so making him an annoying weenie was grating.

When the William Tell Overture kicked in with 15 minutes left in the movie, suddenly Armie Hammer became the Lone Ranger we all know and love.  Those 15 minutes were worth the price of admission, but I doubt everyone gets there.",1406592000,,701,4.480314960629921

5822546,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Unfairly maligned even before it hit movie screens, THE LONE RANGER is wall-to-wall fun and adventure, with some sobering history lessons thrown in for good measure.  Obviously it's a labor of love for all involved, especially director Gore Verbinski and star Johnny Depp.  Depp channels not only the great Jay Silverheels in his Tonto, but also Buster Keaton's stone-faced physical comedy.  Verbinski gets to do his tribute to Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST in his opening railroad station scenes, using long duster coats, closeups of wonderful faces, shadows and light, and that unmistakable guitar sound evoking classic Ennio Morricone.  Marvelous stuff.  The entire cast has so much fun with their larger than life roles, from Armie (The Social Network, J. Edgar) Hammer's John Reid, who grows from an idealistic yet naive lawyer to the avenging angel behind the mask, to William (The Dark Knight, The Perfect Storm) Fichtner, virtually unrecognizable under the makeup of very, very bad guy Butch Cavendish, to Tom (Batman Begins, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) Wilkinson as another very bad guy named Latham Cole, to Helena Bonham (Sweeney Todd, Harry Potter) Carter as a lady of the evening with a whalebone leg, to the entire group.  Special mention must be made of James Badge Dale, Ruth Wilson and Saginaw Grant who all three make their smaller roles memorable.  There are buffalo by the thousands, two trains chasing each other, scorpions, a beautiful white Spirit Horse, a battle between Native Americans and U.S. Soldiers (with the good guy/bad guy roles reversed), the Texas Rangers, and a rifle housed in a very odd place.  Not to mention a bird which may or may not have passed over the rainbow bridge.  See it, and evaluate for yourself beyond the hype.  Hi, yo, Silver!  Away!",1406332800,5,1807,5.010033444816053
5822547,5,B00DJYJWVW,"This movie has a horrible wrap and I do not understand why.

 I have heard it is campy...

...the original Lone Ranger was campy...

 I have heard it's not the same...

...I grew up on the show, I used to watch it a lot, but in retrospect, I don't like it any more, I'd rather watch this!

 I have been told there is too much Native sympathy and that they make the Lone Ranger look bad...

...tough luck, this actually makes more sense from a historical perspective. There is mysticism, there is the fact that the natives knew their own land better than anyone else, and making the Ranger start off as a suit and tie guy only adds more depth, and kind of pays back what they did by naming the native a fool in Spanish. Again, live with it!
 The added conspiracy with the train baron was also a nice touch. It's not factual history, but none of it is far off base in reality. Both natives and the ""settlers"" were victims of the barons and always have been. Now we just call them corporations and... well yes, still banks, the world bank.

 So anyhow, what's not to like? This is silly, creative, and serves as a great coming of age story for the franchise. This deserves a sequel!!! And besides, it's totally got a classic Disney/Apple Dumpling Gang type of vibe to it, at least me thinks so!",1406332800,,1291,4.3112033195020745

I can totally picture the guy playing the Lone Ranger just throwing up his hands and saying ""Screw this"" right at the start of filming and just letting Johnny Depp take over.  It was bound to happen anyway.  The entire story is told from Johnny Depp's point of view, and the Lone Ranger is just an accidental hero fashioned from a weak paper pusher.

It's a fascinating retelling of a classic story.  There will be plenty of folks unhappy with the changes, but revisionism at its finest produces compelling narratives.  Even Johnny Depp's character is not what he seems, and that just makes it more confusing and intimate.

On top of that it seems to me that it is also a work of art. It is a grand entertainment that also explores the meaning of myth, the construction of myth and the importance of heroes.  Sure, there are a few quirks that seem forced and Depp seems at times intemperately obtuse, however his performance works and so do all the others.  The special effects in this movie don't overwhelm the story.  That may be the key to its success.  They actually arise organically out of the narrative and the need for it to swell beyond the reasonable into the mythic.

I would say the key image is the Lone Ranger on Silver leaping from train to train and riding through one train as he fires at the villain on the other.  If that sequence annoys you, the film is not for you.

The only people who could hate this movie are people who have no sense of humor, or people who would be better off dusting off the original show and rewatching it. The POINT of a remake is to do something different.

This movie was a real pleasant surprise. I'd heard the reviewers saying it was terrible and almost missed out on seeing it. I found it to be one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a long time. The pacing is great, the humor is just the right balance between making you laugh or gasp at the silly moments without trying to hard and getting stupid. My family and I laughed so hard we immediately bought a copy because we knew we'd want to re-watch this one, and I the showed it to my parents and my neighbor all of whom had a good time. I didn't even realize how long it was because it stayed entertaining and kept moving the entire time. This take is more focused on Tonto, giving that character a chance to shine and to see his backstory. I'd enjoy if a sequel were made which did show more of the Lone Ranger's history, and used his character which has gained confidence and become more like the icon by the end of the movie.",1405209600,8,1175,4.288288288288288

5822661,4,B00DJYJWVW,"I was disappointed that the Lone Ranger had garnered so many negative reviews but accepted the collective opinion that Disney had produced a clunker despite the talented ensemble they had put together for the movie.  So when it came around on Showtime I thought what the heck, I'll give it a watch.  Wow, I was really surprised how much I liked the film, it was action packed with wonderful settings.  I thought the storyline was solid and that the movie should have been a much bigger hit.  Not entirely sure my judgement was accurate, I asked my usually critical wife to watch it, she too really enjoyed the movie and said that it was much better than what she had expected.  So my bottom line is if you do not have pay per view and are looking for a worthy addition to your Blu-ray collection, do not hesitate to purchase the Lone Ranger, it's an entertaining movie that will be likely viewed more than once.

Update:  I purchased The Lone Ranger from Amazon because it is just one of those films that belongs in in a video library.  I have a good home theater system consisting of a 75 inch Samsung with a 7.1 surround system that I really spent too much money on - oh well.  The Lone Ranger is made for such systems, I really do not want to describe the scenes, but consider this: they actually built two locomotive trains with 4 miles of oval track because they wanted realism.  I think it was the director that said, "" you place an actor on top of a train traveling 40 miles an hour and you get better acting then you would if they were placed in front of a blue screen.""",1403481600,2,1578,4.336734693877551

5822667,1,B00DJYJWVW,"<CONTAINS SPOILERS!>
My first question to you 3+ star-givers is: ""Why?"" Why do you give this piece of trash your money, and praise?

First off, the movie should have been called: Tonto. That's what you get when you give a supporting role to a extravagantly, over-paid actor, such as Johnny Depp.  1/3 of the way into the movie, it seemed the Lone Ranger's character was completely dropped as the focus and was switched to Tonto's history, completely leaving one to question the back-story of our beloved ""Hero"". Instead we just get a few lines... and a terrible plot-twist that can only be described as pathetic,  not to mention the whole 10 mins of Johnny's character being the focus during the credits!
""Sorry Arnie, Johnny said he isn't getting as much screen time as he is used too, and is threatening to leave, so we've re-written your lines, and are moving the story's direction."" LOL I kid, as I am a fan of Johnny Depp

Now to be fair I should start my second point off by saying that the movie was definitely meant to be a comedy, but it felt like a roller-coaster through several genres! I wanted to strangle the writers for not being able to make up their minds about the tone of the movie! Oh look some were-bunnies... is this supposed to be a dark-fantasy? Oh no, its a comedy. ... no wait... that dude just ate someone's heart... maybe it more macabre... NOPE! Johnny Depp keeps feeding his damn dead bird... oh wait... Is this a drama? Nope its just horribly written screenplay and plot!

And third, what the hell was that with the were-rabbits?? And why exactly does the bad-guy eat hearts, and other extremities, other than to scare people? Was he a relative of the Donner Party??
It seems to me that the only explanation to this is that there was an original plot and story-line for something more dark, and gruesome, involving haunted silver ore, turning men, animals, and the nature around it into were-beasts. However I believe somewhere along the line things where completely changed. They were already in the middle of filming the movie, and were told to make it more light-hearted. So instead we were riveted for an answer in five words:  ""Nature is out of balance"" . That's it. Well at least this explains to me my first 2 points...

I sadly saw this in theaters, and heard several people cheer and applaud this horrible film... to quote one person in the theater,
""That's definitely a 'shelver'!""

It seems like our society has taken a liking to crap on a reel, and will pay out the nose for it!

I think it performed poorly at the box office because of that.

I loved it.
Now that I've seen it I can't wait to watch it again.
What a blast!
Fun, funny, light hearted with an engaging story.
A very misunderstood film.
It's the Lone friggin Ranger....not Dances With Wolves.

I knew it was going to be released to theatres, but missed it because I blinked my eyes.  I guess I'm in the minority when it came to this flick.  Johnny Depp made the movie great.  Of course, I also watched on network TV last night with my 22 year old son Dumb and Dumber, oh, for the 11th time since he was 9 years old.  We still laughed our heads off again.

5822681,1,B00DJYJWVW,"So glad I didn't plunk down good money to see this in the theater or buy a copy. Heck, even the $2 rental fee seems like a waste in retrospect. Clayton Moore & Jay Silverheels must be spinning in their graves over the mess that is 2013's The Lone Ranger. Even the Klinton Spilsbury movie from the 80's was better than this boring, over-long, and soul-less travesty. Guess what? Tonto is now an insult-spouting loon who makes ""funny"" faces after every line he says. And The Lone Ranger? Well, he's wimpy, whiny, clumsy, anti-violence, anti-gun... and worst of all, a totally clueless moron! Imagine Jerry Lewis in a mask on horseback and you've got a fairly accurate picture, unpleasant though it may be. If Disney had simply advertised this as a straight-up comedy riff on the Lone Ranger I just MIGHT have been able to enjoy it more, or at least stomach it. It wasn't though. This was supposed to be an action film with light comedic touches. What we get though is another typically heavy-handed, by-the-numbers Jerry Bruckheimer summer blahbuster, and not a particularly funny one either. At least not intentionally. If I'd wanted to watch a comedic western I would've at least picked a GOOD one, like Blazing Saddles or Support Your Local Sheriff, instead of this mindless junk.

I recall Johnny Depp making a big issue while this was being filmed about finally getting a chance to portray Tonto in a positive light and pay proper respect to the native American peoples. Yet his performance in the film is EXACTLY like every other white actor in red face make-up that's been on-screen since... ever!  Lower your voice a notch and speak slow, broken English. Wow, that's original. NOT! At least when Jay Silverheels did it, it didn't come across sounding so insulting & pretentious. And whose brilliant idea was it for Tonto to be covered in white muddy war paint with a dead bird tied to his head? Really?!? I don't care how accurate it may or may not have been, from a visually esthetic perspective it's like having an orangutan wearing a rainbow afro wig & green lipstick playing Cheetah. Depp got this job because of his previous work with Disney & Verbinski on the ""Pirates of The Caribbean"" films. Nothing more. His claim of deserving the role because he's part-Indian is a load of sh! tting bull. Heck, I've got Chippewa blood in my family lineage but I'm certainly not foolish enough to think I have what it takes to play an iconic native American character like Tonto. No. The role should have been played by a full-blooded American Indian. And uhhh, Johnny, what's with the talking using mostly your upper lip?? You look like Mr. Ed when you do that. Sheesh.

Armie Hammer I really cannot fault because he was given a stinker of a script and lousy direction. You give someone poop, tell them to act like poop and pretty much you get... poop. Depp helped produce this horse apple of a film, so he should shoulder a large share of the blame for it. His Tonto is anything BUT wise, clever, loyal & noble. Here, he's portrayed as a wise-cracking smartass who treats John Reid like a burden which Tonto (for no particular reason) has to put up with. So much for a trusted friend & companion. Both of these guys are competent actors so, IMHO, the fault lies with producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski and the three shmucks who wrote the gawd-awful script. Another minus is the film's musical score. Typical Hans Zimmer background noise which attempts to sound thunderingly iconic but instead ends up being a muddled mess; with lame rip-offs of Ennio Morricone's classic score for ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" and of course a watered-down (and surprisingly UNstirring) adaption of the William Tell Overture. *Yawn*

On the plus side, the on-location photography does look nice. But sadly even that has been messed with; digitally desaturated to bleed out the landscape's naturally vibrant colors. As a result, much of the beautiful southwestern scenery looks dull & lifeless. A lot of the CGI stuff is pretty bad, too. The action sequences with a CGI Silver are shockingly crude and embarrassingly AWFUL to look at. Not to mention totally unbelievable & downright stupid. In one scene (for no particular reason) Silver appears up in the branches of a tree(?!?), while in another he leaps down from off a cliff onto the top of a moving train and then proceeds to gallop along it at full speed while the Lone Ranger is shooting at everything in sight! Huh? Really? The terms ""believable"" & ""grounded in reality"" have been thrown completely under the stagecoach here. Sorry, but there isn't enough suspension of disbelief in the Universe to make me swallow this garbage. It isn't thrilling or awesome, it's just ridiculous. Sadly, poor Silver himself just seems like a tacked on afterthought instead of a rich & integral part of Lone Ranger lore. In fact, Silver's entire backstory has been jettisoned so that instead we can focus on the ""tragic"" sob story the writers cooked up for this hip, new Tonto's past. Gag. The whole film just reeks of Jerry Bruckheimer doing his usual ""this is a lame idea and a pisspoor script, but if we crank everything up to '11' the idiots in the audience won't know or care and it'll be a box office smash!"" *SIGH*

I'll stick with reruns of the original TV series, thank you very much. Yes, it's dated and kinda corny but at least it treats the characters with respect, instead of reducing them to laughable buffoons. 2013's The Lone Ranger is yet another perfect example of a movie's creative team having ZERO respect for (or understanding of) the source material. If you watched this movie and just love it to death then good for you, but please don't bust my chops simply because I have an opinion that differs from yours. If you've never seen the original TV series and are unfamiliar with the characters then perhaps you MIGHT be able to shut your brain off and enjoy this as just another big, noisy, mindless, Hollywood summer action flick. However, for those of us who warmly remember Clayton Moore & Jay Silverheels and fondly recall ""those thrilling days of yesteryear"" this movie is a massive, disappointing FAIL.",1402704000,5,6175,4.751164958061509

5822683,3,B00DJYJWVW,"Having grown up with the Lone Ranger on B&W TV, I was excited to get this video and watch it.  Yes, I had heard all of the negative reviews, but figured that a slight remake could not be that bad.  So, I went ahead and ordered it.  Here is what I liked:

  1.  Much like Roger Rabbit, this film tries to present some of the truth that is often left out about the way corporations can coopt law enforcement, military, and other branches of the government.

  2.  I found some of the extra features to be very interesting, especially the parts about making up items for the movie.

  3.  I was glad that I did not go to the movies and instead bought this DVD to see the movie with.

Here is what I did not like as much:

  1.  The movie runs so counter to the original series and movies about the Lone Ranger that it is hard to reconcile them.  Perhaps if they had named the movie something else, it might have worked better.

  2.  The movie had a very disjointed feel to it.  The story seemed to jump around too much.  One was reminded of the movie ""Little Big Man"" from the way it was told, it just did not flow as easily.

  3.  The movie seemed to swing from believable human interaction to unbelievable human interaction as if they could not decide what type of movie they were trying to make.

Some reviewers compare his performance in Pirates to this movie which is ridiculous. It's a completely different character! Depp completely upstages Armie Hammer with his unique portrayal of the famous Tonto. The script writers obviously favored Tonto as well, and why not? Who can resist the lure and mystery of the Native American culture.

This movie is great fun to watch! It's mostly lighthearted and never once do you think it takes its self too seriously. There are some serious bits that almost bring you to tears, but the comedy comes in just in time. There's a lot of action and great stunts too!

5822741,4,B00DJYJWVW,"I'm actually surprised this movie didn't do better at the box office, it's an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. The way some reviewers complain you'd think this movie wasn't half what the old Clayton Moore/Lone Ranger TV/ movie(?) bits were- it's better! Silly, full of ""impossible in the real world"" action? All here but there decades ago too- find an old rerun and see for yourself. 2013's ""The Lone Ranger"" is what the old days would've done with a similar budget & technology.

Ignore the 1 Star reviews and give it a chance. All you have to do is remember  it's ""fun"" not ""reality"" (I doubt the producers of either era ever meant to make a ""great"" western). I'll certainly be watching it for the loads of detail (lot of effort obviously put into the production) and the wonderful scenery- the story really isn't that bad either.

I really mean it, give this one a chance, the story has silly details but a lot of good elements too- and ""the look"" is ""as good"" as any ""real Western"" that I remember seeing.

Don't bother with the DVD only option, you'll get only the movie, bloopers, subtitling and closed captioning. Amazon should make it clear that in the DVD/Blu ray combo the Blu ray has bloopers, a deleted scene and three featurettes;
1. Riding The Rails of The Lone Ranger- Learn what it takes to film one of the most epic train chases of all time.
2. Armie's Western Road Trip- Hit the trail with Armie Hammer as he wades through rivers, battles dust storms, and shares what it's like to shoot in the film' spectacular and historic American Southwest locations.
3,Becoming A Cowboy- How do you turn a bunch of greenhorn actors into gunslingers? Send them to Cowboy Boot Camp to learn how to rope, ride, shootand stop a horse on a mark.
It costs just a few dollars more than the DVD alone and should be worth the extra cost to anyone who has, or will have, a Blu ray player.",1400371200,4,1896,4.48695652173913

5822744,1,B00DJYJWVW,UGGGGGGHHHH. So clearly Johnny Depp does not guarantee a good film being made.  This was awful. We couldn't even finish it. My better-half's eyeballs were rolling back in his head and I had a serious longing for the epinonimous hero's death at the beginning of the film to have been final and saved me the pain of watching another hour before I shut it down.,1400112000,2,358,4.507692307692308
5822745,5,B00DJYJWVW,Good movie but to really like it you need to be a Johnny Depp fan. The movie follows the legend of the Lone Ranger only very loosely. But then it was made for entertainment not history.,1400025600,,185,4.166666666666667
5822746,5,B00DJYJWVW,"My assessment of the film is mixed.  The more you view it the better you like it, but I do think the little kid in the beginning (and throughout the film occasionally is a little annoying).  Great last 11 minutes of music, stunts and excitement and sporadic stunts / comedy / and dialogue during the other 2 hours make the journey very admirable light entertainment.  Especially when we have to wait until 2016 for Johnny Depp and (hopefully) Gore Verbinski's input to make another ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie!",1399939200,2,515,4.764044943820225

5822750,5,B00DJYJWVW,"It was primarily an action movie, of course, based on the premise of the old TV series.  I'm sure many of you have seen it or at least heard of it.  Of course, this movie takes you to the beginning of the unlikely duo becoming connected.  Tonto is a tribal outcast of the Commanches.  Of course, it's a Western movie, at a time when the railroad (aka Iron Horse) is being built, and there are struggles with the Indians.  (I won't go into details but I personally think we treated the Indians soooo very badly.) Both Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer did a great job in their roles, but I have to say that Johnny Depp is just over the top.  His dry sense of humor, comments, and subtle facial movements are just fantastic.  As with all his movies, Depp adds something really unique and really creative. Stunts are great.  And the white horse is a ""spirit horse"" who takes a liking to the Ranger, saving his life several times.

I bought this movie and will watch it many times.  It is really great!",1399507200,3,993,4.3478260869565215

5822765,4,B00DJYJWVW,Of course Johnny Depp is my all time favorite actor and he doesn't fail in this movie either! He is so very funny and entertaining though out the whole move and just carries off this version of Tonto so well. The Long Ranger (Armie Hammer) version in this film is so very different but still was very well played as well. I've watched this movie twice and picked up so things I missed the first time which made watching it again so much fun.,1399161600,,441,4.261904761904762

5822767,1,B00DJYJWVW,"The movie is one big mess with the two leads careening between stupidity and seriousness. Total disregard for actual human dignity and respect with scenes set up for cheap laughs and cheap explosions and violence. They can take a violent wipe out of a whole Indians tribe than immediately follow that up with a cheap joke by Depp. Anyone who thinks that's amusing need to get their head examined. Depp takes his Pirate character and takes it beyond distasteful, disgusting, and disrespectful. I'm surprised native Americans didn't totally boycott this movie in disgust. If anyone remember the old black and white tv series, they know that the Tonto character, although stereotyped as a white man's servant (which minority character wasn't back then?), was portrayed with some semblance of honor and pride. Depp almost totally plays it for laughs - a half wit, absurdly face painted with a dead bird on his head. The Hollywood Studios continue to show total disrespect of audiences when they put out these megabuck costing carps and expect people to just swallow it.
I'm so glad this movie bombed and hope this will serve as a notice to the Studios to at least put some intelligence into their projects. I know this is going to p....ss the reviewers who gave it more than 2 stars but I'm gladly going to say it - you're all halfwits who enable Studios to continue making these mindless carps.",1399161600,2,1391,4.824267782426778

The characters never develop and you never really care about anyone.  The Lone Ranger is self-rightous and whining all the time.  Tonto is OK, but you don't ever really love his character.  The plot is predictable and the action is not engaging.  There are no surprises here at all.  The humor is not funny and predictable (potential spoiler example-Tonto states it would stink to have an itch on your nose {they were buried up to their necks} and then the Lone Ranger feels he has to itch his nose).

The review below about the references to the spirit world idea really fits with the 50s show and is very enlightening. Didn't you ever ask yourself how the Lone Ranger and Tonto always gallop to where they are needed in perfectly cleaned costumes on perfectly fresh horses into an otherwise dirty western world? Well, they emerge from the spirit world; both were ""resurrected"" from the dead in the original origin story. But the filmmakers missed their chance to complete the circle: why not have the boy in the film be named Clayton and at the end have the ancient Tonto (reference to Little Big Man)  place a hand on his head and instill the idea of a radio/TV show in his imagination and close with the boy hearing the beginning of the radio or TV show... ""With his faithful Indian companion Tonto the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early western United States.

5822802,1,B00DJYJWVW,"Ideal Situation: Disney releases ""The Lone Ranger"" as a PG-rated family-friendly action film that stays true to the original series. It starts a major franchise of six movies, plus books, comics, merchandise, and a spin-off TV series. Its popularity surpasses ""Pirates"" and ""Indiana Jones"" and comes close to ""Star Wars"".
What Really Happened: Disney releases ""The Lone Ranger"" as a PG-13 rated film filled with graphic violence, dark themes, and foul language. It bombs majorly in the box office and parents are stuck trying to explain to their bewildered kids what a prostitute is and why a man would eat another man's heart. The franchise ends before it begins, tons of money is flushed down the toilet, and an American icon's image is destroyed.
SO HOW DID THEY DO IT? So glad you asked.
1. TURN A HERO INTO A WIMP
In the 1950s, Clayton Moore donned a mask and made the Lone Ranger the most famous hero of the classic west. He was strong, tough, smart, honest, compassionate, a whiz with a gun, and a man of faith. Disney's Lone Ranger is a tender-footed greenhorn who ""doesn't believe in guns"" and spends most of his time whimpering, whining, getting shot and punched, and adjusting his mask. He's portrayed as ""the wrong brother"", an accidental hero who is more at home in the city than the wild west.
2. TURN A VILLAIN INTO A CANNIBAL
Butch Cavendish is a bad man. We figure that out in the original series when he murders the Texas Rangers and tries to take over the town of Colby. That was all the audience needed to despise the character and cheer for the Lone Ranger to bring him to justice. Disney apparently wasn't satisfied. They made Butch Cavendish a CANNIBAL. The first time we see him, he's shooting law officers at point-blank range; next, he's kneeling over Dan Reid's dying body, cutting his heart out of his chest and eating it! WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?! We learn later that he cut off a woman's leg and ate that, and also that he's eaten part of his foot ""to win a bet"". It's a totally irrelevant, unnecessary addition to an already despicable outlaw that was apparently added for shock value. Cavendish's scenes are enough to kick the film out of the family-friendly range.
3. DESTROY THE HERO/SIDEKICK RELATIONSHIP
The original series presented the Lone Ranger and Tonto as an inseparable team, best friends who work together without any racial tension. Loyalty and trust were at the heart of their relationship. Disney turned Tonto into the dominant member of the twosome (see the front cover of the DVD) and they are constantly bickering. Tonto tackles the Lone Ranger and puts a knife to his throat; he flips the Lone Ranger over his shoulder in a painful judo move; he tries to leave the Lone Ranger several times; the Lone Ranger leaves Tonto to die in the desert, returning to help him only because he needs directions; Tonto says the Lone Ranger is ""not a man""; the Lone Ranger calls Tonto a savage: the list goes on and on and on.
4. CHANGE THE MEANING OF ""KEMOSABE""
The meaning of the word ""Kemosabe"" is ""scout"" or ""trusty scout"". It is a term of endearment and admiration. Disney changes the meaning to ""wrong brother"". again, WHY?!
5. MAKE THE THEME BI-POLAR
One minute a young boy is watching a man's throat get slit. The next minute Tonto is dragging the Lone Ranger's head through a pile of poop. One minute an outlaw is trying to cut off an old lady's finger, the next minute Tonto is talking about itching. This film infuriatingly vacillates between dark, sadistic violence and campy, little-kid humor. Trying to figure out the mood of the film is like trying to figure out your mother-in-law; it's not happening! Who was this film made for?
6. ROB THE LONE RANGER OF HIS FAITH
In the originals, the Lone Ranger is a man of faith who displays Christian character and is an ideal role-model. He quotes Bible verses and treats everyone with respect. Disney's Lone Ranger says that John Locke's ""Two Treatises of Government"" is his Bible. He seems indifferent to faith, and doesn't display much character.
7. INSERT PROSTITUTES INTO A ""FAMILY FILM""
""Red"" is a prostitute who runs a ""house of sin"" in town. Her missing right leg, stolen and eaten by Cavendish, is replaced by an ivory leg with a gun inside it, which gives Disney a license to allow Red to hike up her dress whenever and even invite men to touch it. Why add such openly sexual themes into a ""family"" film? She has no function in the plot other than to allow Helena Bonham Carter to insert her aging mug into another Johnny Depp film.  We learn that Tonto is a frequent visitor to the whore-house, further dragging down a character who is supposed to be a role-model.
8. INSERT A CONTRIVED LOVE-TRIANGLE
As if the plot needed help being cliche, Disney threw in a love triangle between the Lone Ranger, his brother Dan, and DAN'S WIFE. The script avoids adultery by killing off Dan within the first hour, but the suggestion of love/lust between the Lone Ranger and a married woman is inappropriate and unnecessary.
9. USE MODERN-DAY HUMOR IN AN OLD SETTING
In the 1800s, did people really say things like, ""what's with the mask"", ""violate me with a duck's foot"", and ""un-refrigerated pickles""? Way too much modern, wink-wink type humor is inserted in the script, and it takes away from the film's authenticity.
10. MAKE IT 2.5 HOURS WITH NO REDEEMING VALUE
At the end of 2.5 hours, the audience is left asking ""why?"". What was the point of the senseless killing? With no character to admire and uphold as a role model, the overall tone of the film is very pessimistic, dark, and hopeless. We're left wondering if there are any good men (or women) left in the world. Many of the characters in this film appear to be addicted to alcohol, and, based on the hopeless theme, one could hardly blame them. Why spend 2.5 hours on something with nothing to show for it in the end? This, more than anything, is the most unfortunate aspect of Disney's The Lone Ranger.
Final note: Armie Hammer would make a great Lone Ranger, if it was based on the originals. He has a squeaky-clean, all-American image and is the perfect tall, dark, and handsome hero type. He did well with the script that was given him, but he would've shined if he were to play the Lone Ranger like Clayton Moore did.",1398211200,35,6278,4.635547576301616
5822803,4,B00DJYJWVW,"This is not the Lone Ranger of the 1950s. Anyone wanting that is going to be sorely disappointed.

It is good fun mixing action sequences (many close to slapstick in nature), humor, a little romance, and some delving into the nature of good and evil, and insanity.

Johnny Depp does a wonderful job as a crazy burned out personality who has moments of lucid thought, but is mostly in his own world.

Armie Hammer plays a mostly clueless Lone Ranger who can't quite figure out what is going on around him, and has to be saved by Tonto periodically.

The story itself is nothing real special. Evil railroad men in league with bandits in league with lawmen turned to the dark side.

The stunts are great, the lighting and music is mostly pretty good, and the scenery has a lot going for it too.

It is not a classic western tale, but it is a lot of fun.",1398211200,2,850,4.348101265822785

5822807,2,B00DJYJWVW,"It seems almost criminal the amount of money that must have been thrown at this schizophrenic mess. Where to begin? The film starts off brightly enough, with what seems to be a confident hand at the helm, but then veers off wildly, becoming a massive train wreck that dwarfs the three actual train wrecks depicted in the film (yes, there are three train wreck scenes in this overlong mess.) Clearly someone thought they could take a western script and turn it into a Pirates of the Plains. But this movie cannot decide if it is a lighthearted comic adventure or a new Saw film. Goofy, comical moments are interspersed with over the top violence, including a heart being cut out, skulls flattened by a massive beam, and a cannibal as one of the villains. (Not to mention that the chief villain - shhh, it's a secret - is obvious from the moment he appears on screen, because... Well, we all know who the villains are in movies, don't we?) Thrown in for good measure is a whorehouse straight out of the awful Will Smith version of ""Wild, Wild West"" where Helena Bonham Carter, apparently completely in character, earns a paycheck for slumming. The film goes on and on and on, veering from low comedy and characters straight out of ""Pirates"" to scenes of slaughter. The commercials make it look like something you could bring your kids to, but they'll end up having nightmares. And it is too stupid to be fit for adults.",1398211200,,1417,4.604743083003952

That being said... I loved this movie. Johnny Depp is hilarious AND serious as Tonto and Armie Hammer is believable as the Lone Ranger. The movie is premised on the old TV classic from the '50's and '60's yet it has it's own place in film. I was not offended by Depp's portrayal of Tonto. In fact I enjoyed his interpretation of him. The movie goes into Tonto's background better than the TV classic. That makes you feel as though you may actually know the character and can feel his pains.

5822821,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Having watched the Clayton Moore version of the Lone Ranger as a kid, and having a great dislike for Johnny Depp as an actor, I was ready to hate this movie when it came on my satellite dish.  The plan was to watch a few minutes of it, then never watch it again.  Imagine my surprise, then, when I was immediately entranced by this film.

It was a complete recasting of the story, highly respectful of its forbears, and a visual delight.  Hammer's protrayal of the Lone Ranger was one of a hero in training.  Some reviewers opined that this Lone Ranger was not accomplished enough, and something of a klutz.  Well, yes and no.  However, like Clayton Moore's Ranger, Hammer's interpretation retained that puritanical sense of fair play and proper dispensation of justice that made the Lone Ranger the enduring role model that he is.

As for Tonto, suffice it to say that Depp should have received Oscar consideration for his mesmerizing performance.  Both as the young and old Tonto, Depp infused the character with both the nobility and tragedy of his Comanche ancestors, while at the same time being funny and witty.

Add in the spectacular visuals, the flawless timing between Depp and Hammer, and superbly executed action scenes, and you have a movie that any Lone Ranger fan should love.",1397692800,4,1291,4.748878923766816

The background is really the star of the show and I loved it as I've been to some of those areas where it was filmed. It was really great to see it on the big screen and the story is told so well, loved the little boy. The horse did an outstanding job and when the theme song plays, I have to cheer.

I didn't appreciate the way the movie started with a native American in a display case labeled ""savage"" and there was Johnny Depp in the display instead of a model. I think Johnny Depp is an ok actor but he's gotten to where he just plays kind of the same part with the same facial expressions and he was not the right one for this part. If you have a Native American or an Asian or an African American in a story, the part should be played by a Native American, Asian or African American. Having someone like Johnny Depp fake being another race is unacceptable and disrespectful. The only reason Depp was in it was to try to attract people who liked the Pirates of the Caribbean and that was just wrong. This also should not have been a Disney film.

Having listened to the William Tell Overture by Giacchino Rossini growing up (the last half of which was used as the theme for The Lone Ranger), I was interested in Disney's take on The Lone Ranger. Alas, I was more disappointed than happy. For one thing, there are more uses of Hell and Damn in this film than in any other Disney production (though they avoided taking the Lord's Name in vain this time), the violence is too intense for a Disney film, though of course the worst violence occurs off-screen, just like in John Carter a stream of urine is seen (which is disgusting), the story itself doesn't really make much sense and the frame story is distracting (which plot devices worked for The Princess Bride and THE PRESTIGE, but not for this film). The cannibalism angle was intense for Disney, but they handled it discreetly. Like The Princess And The Frog, though, the suggestion of it was disturbing and too dark for a movie aimed at children.

There were some funny bits, including a horse imbibing, but the only part I really enjoyed was the climax, when the last half of the William Tell Overture began playing.

View it once.

This movie is an incoherent mess. You have serious and dark scenes, then when The Lone Ranger shows up, its comedy time.
This Lone Ranger is a self-doubting, whining, bumbling idiot throughout the whole film. Tonto has to literally walk him through everything in the film.
He whines about the terrain being too rough, not being able to properly fire a gun and at one point it being too dark outside. Really????
What kind of a leading hero whines all the time, and has to have his sidekick walk him through everything?
You have stupid scenes like the horse drinking beer from a crate, to Tonto jumping 50 feet down and landing on rocks in a train car with no damage. Both heroes get thrown from a crashing train and walk away unscathed. The Lone Ranger's mask is made from the vest of his dead brother. He wears is as a symbol of his oath to avenge him, NOT WHITE GUILT.
With a mix of lame dialogue, overdone CGI and flat out stupid scenes, I can see why this was a flop. I went into seeing this film with low expectations. IT EXCEEDED THEM! This was dumber-er than I expected.

The story was plausible and very well acted.  It mixed humor in without letting it become a farce in any way.

I believe it was respectful to the original mythology of The Lone Ranger (and Tonto for that matter).  I am convinced they chose 1935 as a tip of the hat to Britt Reid (John's grandson who became the Green Hornet from the radio/tv serial of that same name). And suspect the young boy who is being told the story by Tonto might be intended to be Reid.  Likewise the hat tip to the townsman named Clayton Moore!  Little nods like that were just icing on the cake.

The story itself gave a fairly broad touch to the time period when railroads changed the entire west for better or worse but they did it in an unvarnished way.

I think Johnny Depp was excellent as 'Captain Jack Sparrow' but was a poor choice to play Tonto. There was too much use of (and dependence on) computer generated graphics. It is similar to 'The Hobbit' in that it took a story that was strong entirely on it's own merit, and weakened it;  too much technology, poor casting (Johnny Depp), and in the 'The Lone Ranger's case, too much humor imposed on what was an action/adventure character story.

This is a spectacularly filmed journey with realistic (CGI) locales, costumes and colors reminiscent of the old west......and who can overlook the crusty, unshaven, filthy bad guys who execute their roles with indifference and speak with parsed English!  The plot centers around the expansion of the Railroad, the uneasy peace with the Comanche Nation and the unheralded arrival of the town's new Attorney (Armie Hammer).  All the pieces will be thrown together with daring escapes, deadly ambushes, Indian uprising and the most action packed , hysterically funny, dynamic train chase sequence ever filmed.  Our hero, who by a series of misfortunes and tragedies, evolves as the  mask-wearing avenger for ""justice"" who develops an uneasy alliance with the odd Indian loner, Tonto.  I believe this film faired poorly at the box office because audiences have become accustomed to the image of a ""super hero""--the He-man who wins the girl, dispenses the evil doers and all doing so with the most spectacular special effects available.  I don't think many people are ready to laugh at characters who are fallible and funny amidst gunfights, explosions and moments of seriousness.  With this being said I will tell you this is a great tale of the old west with a stretch of one's imagination!

5822902,5,B00DJYJWVW,"In what seems to have become an annual event, the movie I enjoyed most in 2013 didn't do terribly well at the box office. In 2010 it was SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD. 2011: COWBOYS AND ALIENS (the extended cut on the Blu-Ray is better than the theatrical release by the by). 2012 was of course the year of JOHN CARTER. Now just in time for 2013 we have THE LONE RANGER.

Sigh. What can I say? Some people say they want something different at the movies. I genuinely do.

The press leading up to its release was awash in negativity. The snark came in basically two kinds: Those who thought it was racist to cast Johnny Depp as Tonto, and those who thought it was racist to make the movie at all.

Johnny Depp having some amount of Native American blood and being proud of that part of his ancestry in interviews going back at least twenty-five years counted for nothing. The film production courting the Commanche community and Depp being made an honorary member of the tribe didn't matter. The biggest movie star on the planet wanted to play the role and was the only reason the movie got greenlit at all, but you don't understand, he lacks the requisite genetic bona fides. He's no Jay Silverheels.

Yeah, about that. Jay Silverheels played Tonto on The Lone Ranger tv series of the 1950s. Somehow in some people's heads Silverheels' performance is better and worthier than Johnny Depp's could ever be because you know, he was a full blooded Mohawk. But have you watched episodes of The Lone Ranger lately? Silverheels did the best anyone could with what is a total nothing part. Tonto is basically only there to serve his Caucasian kemosabe. The fact they got a real Native American to play that doesn't mean we should accord it more praise than it deserves.

Ideally what the complainers wanted was for someone like Adam Beach or Lou Diamond Phillips to be cast. They mean well, but that line of thinking is creatively limited and leads to hewing too close to crappy tradition. I've seen Depp's performance criticized variously as being a racist cliche and as being nothing more than Jack Sparrow in the Wild (Wild) West. It can't be both, so which is it?

Actually? It's neither.

Depp famously took Rolling Stone Keith Richards as inspiration for his career defining role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movies. Once that was pointed out, it was obvious: He seems permanently intoxicated, is always slightly slurring his words, he dresses a bit like a gypsy, and his body language is loose and fluid like the rum he clamors for.

Depp's Tonto is miles away from that. He's quiet and determined where Sparrow was flamboyant and dissolute. He moves with smooth precision while all around him is chaos. He's a planner not a schemer --the definition being that a planner focuses on how to solve a problem, while a schemer's focus is on manipulating someone else in solving it.

In short: Depp plays Tonto as Buster Keaton, ""the Great Stone Face"" of silent film comedy, with a left turn at the Jay Silverheels. You can see it in the deadpan facial expressions (the white warpaint helps with this tremendously and more about that later), the body language, and if you still don't get it: The finale is an extended tribute to the two train chase in Keaton's THE GENERAL.

What Depp takes from Silverheels are his speech patterns. It's a nice nod because to millions of people, that what Tonto sounds like. Depp's turn is a more interesting conversationalist though. It all builds to subversive effect when the Lone Ranger meets some Commanche elders and none of them talk like Tonto. In fact, they think he's a bit touched in the head. They're saying, ""We know our ways are strange to you, white man, but Tonto is an eccentric weirdo even by our standards.""

Here Tonto's given a backstory and motivation of his own ala Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. He's a man without a tribe, separated from his people and society because of a tragedy he feels responsible for. He's given --dare I say it-- a personality.

Which is refreshing. Unlike every other depiction of the character on screen, Tonto is shown to be more than just his race, more than just the Lone Ranger's trusty Indian companion. Not being a full blooded Native American himself, Depp doesn't see the character as a spokesperson for Native Americans everywhere. Which frees him to do what real artists always do: Take inspiration and use it to create something new.

The complainers went on about Tonto's strange look, saying it wasn't in accordance with any tribal tradition, but they missed the whole point of it: Like the Lone Ranger this Tonto has his own mask. It's one he wears for his own reasons and one he never takes off. If you doubt what I'm saying, just look at the advertising logo and tell me whose eyes those are behind the mask.

Which brings us to the Lone Ranger himself, played by Armie Hammer. I've heard criticisms about how the movie treats the character, saying it's not respectful and he's not cool enough. If you go back to the tv and radio shows though, you see the Ranger was never cool. He didn't shoot to kill --ever. Didn't drink, smoke, cuss, or show an interest in the ladies. He's the man who'd go into the toughest saloon in town and order a glass of milk.

Despite what you might've heard, the movie doesn't ridicule the character. What it does is stay true to the ""straight arrow"" children's hero created by Fran Striker in 1933. The twist is everyone else (including Tonto) react to it the way people actually would. Which is funny. In the end, he still wins against the bad guys on his own terms --which is even better.

What else? The movie tells the story of how John Reid became the Lone Ranger. It sticks very close to the story detailed in the original radio show (and later tv series). The cinematography is beautiful and shows off Monument Valley better than anyone since John Ford. It has an old fashioned sense of storytelling informed not just by Ford but by Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. Also: Not an overabundance of CGI. Those are real trains and horses, people.

The movie runs a bit long, but it's a feast for all that. There's adventure, humor, a touch of the gruesome, some intense action, and heart and spirit to spare here. Do yourself a favor and see it.",1395705600,4,6314,4.618198037466548

5822919,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Here I was all set to hate this movie.  I had put off even watching this movie because of all the negative comments I'd heard along with all of the negative reviews Id read about it.  Since I couldn't find anything else to watch last night, I decided to give it a go.  The first half hour or so had me almost convinced that the critics were right and I was ALMOST prepared to shut it off and go watch something else.  Im glad I didnt.  The next two hours were absolutely entertaining stuff, swinging wildly between some extreme action and some VERY funny dialogue.  Johnny Depp played his part wonderfully.  I had heard nothing but criticism about him playing Tonto, but he played it so deadpan that I had to laugh.

This version of Lone Ranger was, in many respects a throwback to many older films.  The Marx Brothers Duck Soup, for example,  is the one that most frequently came to my mind.  At first, I suffered from what I believe might have tainted many reviewers negative sense about this movie: perhaps a kind of sacred notion of who and what the Lone Ranger should be.  I have experienced this before with the Batman and Robin TV series that turned the Dark Knight into a kind of campy idiot.  I thoroughly despised that series in turning one of my favorite childhood heroes into this utterly un-Batman-like fool. So it was that my initial reaction to this version of the Lone Ranger was entirely negative.  Here, another one of my childhood heroes was being depicted as a complete nerd-like dork and Tonto, his faithful sidekick was this rather insane, outrageous Comanche who walked around with a dead bird on his head.  This was enough to make any hard-core Lone Ranger fan foam at the mouth.  But then, as the movie progressed and the old stereotype of what the Lone Ranger should be was rapidly dashed to pieces, the true nature of this film began to emerge as an absolutely fun movie with some truly great slapstick, puns, and really good action.  In short,  by the end of the movie, I was converted from a hater to a complete appreciator of this movie.

Many critics complained of its lengthtwo and half hoursand its true; two and a half hours is ridiculously long for a funny action movie.  But you know what?  I didn't even realize it was that long until I read those reviews afterwards.  It seemed to be just as long as it needed to be in order to complete the movie properly.  There was not one part of it that I would cut, even though the beginning didn't make any sense to me at first.  Having watched it all the way, the beginning was essential in bringing the movie full circle.

I am given to suspect that many of those harsh critics of this Lone Ranger movie would probably have given Duck Soup or other Marx Brothers or WC Fields absurdities high marks as some of the great movie comedy classics.  So why not this Lone Ranger?  It was every bit as funny.  The photography and acting were first rate.  It was full of some excellent action sequences (unlike what several critics have alleged).

Bottom line:  The Lone Ranger was one fun movie.  I would recommend this movie to anyone capable of suspending their personal notions about the ""sacredness"" of the Lone Ranger & Tonto characters.  This Lone Ranger is a funny parody; a what-if kind of speculation in an alternate universe where the heroes are turned into a kind of goofy buddy-movie that for me, at least, was very funny and highly entertaining. It's also a kind of speculation and prequel as to how the Lone Ranger became the great Lone ranger.",1395446400,5,3530,4.517350157728707

5822924,1,B00DJYJWVW,"The reviews I heard and read all said this was a bad movie.  But, the trailer made it look like a lot of fun! I thought maybe reviewers just don't like a fun movie. Lesson learned: pay attention to reviews!

One of the (many) problems with this movie is that it can't quite decide whether to be dark and heavy, or cheesy and campy.  The result feels like cinematic bends: you go way down deep where the pressure is intense, but then you rocket up to the shallows. That hurts!  There is also a disjointed story-within-a-story structure - kind of like ""The Princess Bride"", but without any suave or clever Peter Falk.

The plot meanders along, never settling into a secure stride.  There is the naive, idealistic, college-educated young man; the vengenge-driven, possibly mad Native American; the lovely, sad-eyed lady; the ugly villain with his cleverly-camouflaged confederate.... Oh, and the legendary albino horse.  But they all just swirl vaguely around each other, without ever coalescing into a coherent story.  Of them all, the horse is the most nuanced character.

I will say, the one redeeming part of the whole film is the final chase scene.  In this concluding segment, the movie settles at last into cheesy, campy silliness, with high-speed hijinks and impossible near misses.

But overall, do yourself a favor - don't rent the whole film.  Save your money, and just watch the trailer sixty times!",1395360000,9,1408,4.894514767932489

5822953,1,B00DJYJWVW,"For Starters, the movie smacked of trying too hard to be clever. It was over-acted (even beyond that it was likely intentional)and many of the spoofs failed. The biggest failure was the absurd portrayal of who the Lone Ranger was. Turn a pacifist lawyer who was in love with his Texas Ranger brother's wife into a very lousy hero, was beyond reason and did not work at many levels. The many, many subplots were weak, and at best, were only there to get from one stunt or chase scene to the next. The movie was way, way too long for the content. For me the attempt to bring Captain Jack Sparrow into the roll of Tonto simply did not work very well. In short the attempt to bring in everything from the Living dead, Werewolf movies (The silver Bullet), Chase scene movies, Cowboy plots of the fifties (Good Guy- white hats, Bad Guy-Black hats), Broke Back Mountain, and Lord knows what else made this a plate of spaghetti with really bad sauce and rotten meat balls.

5822956,1,B00DJYJWVW,"SPOILER ALERT!  This is an over-long, western / comedy travesty.  I'm shocked that they can't get a great franchise like the Lone Ranger correct on the screen.  First there was that horrible 80's remake, then that ho-hum 2003 TV Movie, now this.  You have Johnny Depp as Tonto, strike one.  Arnie Hammer's buffoon-like portrayal of the Lone Ranger, strike two.  And this horrible script that doesn't know if its a comedy or a western, strike three!  The movie is so uneven that it literally knocks you out of the film.  The villains are completely two-dimensional and way too silly to be scary but they go around slaughtering people, making you wonder if you should laugh or cringe.  The rangers are stereotypically scruffy, dirty and tough but completely out of place in the comedic back drop of this movie.  Tonto goes around quoting one liners with a stuffed crow on top of his head while tromping through the wild west like a Native comedian.  You later find out that his entire tribe was killed by the bad guys but you never feel the gravity of his loss because he acts so goofy throughout the whole film.  And Arnie Hammer comes off more like Judge Reinhold's dorky brother then the Lone Ranger.  He never shows any sadness that his brother was gunned down because he's too busy trying to hump his brother's wife.  And the kissing scene between the Lone Ranger and his dead brother's wife at the end of the film is a bit inappropriate!  An entire tribe of Comanches are slaughtered by the F-Troop like soldiers with a gatling gun and it evokes no emotion in either Tonto or the Lone Ranger because they are too busy doing shtick.  I know that this is an origin story, but the Lone Ranger doesn't even go into action until the last 10 minutes of this 2 1/2 hour film and it consists of him riding a horse on top of a moving train?!?  You never see The Lone Ranger shoot anyone, not even the man responsible for his brother's death?!?  The only time a silver bullet makes an appearance is when he shoots the bad guy's gun?  Why doesn't he just shoot the guy??  And his horse Silver is like some mythical magic horse who eats scorpions, huh??  Mix a completely emotionless female protagonist (who doesn't seem to care that her husband was just killed), her equally solemn son, the ridiculous yet homicidal villains, and the comedic duo of Tonto and The Lone Ranger and you end up with this mess.",1394928000,9,2398,4.543123543123543

At least at the end they did the Wm. Tell Overture.  I guess everything of the past America is fair game for ridicule.  it was a massacre and villainy then a comedy, almost slapstick.  It is PG-13 so I was expecting on the level of Pirates.  This got pretty gory and I would not take a small child...which let's face it, most people today think anything less than ""R"" is okay for children.  Since I am from Silverton CO, and know a LOT about trains, I also was a little disappointed in his depiction of the train things. But then I am a perfectionist when it comes to steam trains.

5823017,4,B00DJYJWVW,"There is a lot of negativity surrounding this film and I'm not sure I understand why.  It's not a perfect film by any means but, it has some truly standout points.  I'll try to keep this short and to the point...

Pros
Highly Entertaining
Wonderfully Filmed
Verbinski's signature all over it
Grittier than expected

Cons
Bloated run time
Debatable cast
Some narrative problems

The real point here is, is The Lone Ranger is the remake/re-imagining we didn't really expect or need.  That being said, this is not a bad film.  Gore Verbinski knows how to make a film and how to make a film well.  I personally loved all three of his contributions to the Pirates series.  Sure, he tends to get a little long winded and off the mark sometimes (At World's End) but, this doesn't detract too much from the fact that the film is entertaining.  Johnny Depp is a great actor with great versatility but, could possibly be miscast here (this seems to happen from time to time) but, he makes due and tries his best to hold it together.  The film is quirky, gritty and above all ...entertaining.  Its runtime is, in my opinion, its only big setback...  It just goes on a little too long for what it is.  The narrative starts to get murky and and the viewing gets a little cumbersome.  Other than that, The Lone Ranger is a fun time.  Give it a try.",1394323200,,1334,4.450413223140496
5823018,2,B00DJYJWVW,"Just awful.  Hollywood will not make a successful Lone Ranger movie until the elites start thinking like kids.  THe Lone Ranger is not someone to be mocked or satirized.  Grown men (like me) still regard him as their ultimate role model.  I highly recommend ""The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold.""  THAT is how to shoot a Lone Ranger movie.",1394323200,,345,4.5
5823019,1,B00DJYJWVW,"I was hoping with Johnny Depp it would be worth watching and the trailers looked pretty good, but it really just wasn't my kind of movie.  I don't like scenes with people cutting out hearts and eating them, and I don't like creepy things like scorpions crawling on faces. Strangely, with all those things going on, it was also quite boring.  I'm sure it was great for some, but just not for me. I turned it off before it was over.",1394323200,2,430,4.296296296296297

There is a lot of action.  There is a lot of un-believablely bad dialogue.  There is no relation to the old/original Lone Ranger show.  But the final action sequence goes on, and on, and on (in an Energizer-bunny kinda way...)

The horse is the best actor out of the entire cast.  (And he relied on a ton of CGI effects...)

The best quote - as Tonto is staring at the Lone Ranger's horse - ""I can't decide if this horse is stupid or pretending to be stupid"".

And, if a viewer is expecting that this film to be a remake of the TV series like Superman movies were to its predecessor, or even Spider-Man, or to see a comic book like hero, then yes, one would be disappointed.

No. Go back and watch any of the promotional materials and tell me that it was marketed as a full on spoof. You can't. Did they show a quirky sense of humor? Yes. Did they show a total raping of my western hero that screams like a girl when he's shot in the shoulder by an arrow? No.

They wasted... WASTED a good property like The Lone Ranger and made him into a wussified, anti-gun, monkey and I hated every stupid second of this movie.",1394323200,3,740,4.096551724137931

The only thing I can figure is most of these critics are way too young to have grown up listening to the weekly broadcasts of TLR and then watching the early television series with Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels.  A lot of these critics seemed have a particular problem with Depp's portrayal of Tonto.  If you understand that Verbinski directed much of this story in a tongue in cheek fashion, I think you will absolutely love this film.  But for me, it was all pretty much worth it when, toward the end of the movie, we see TLR on that gorgeous white horse atop a moving train and then suddenly that wonderfully stirring theme music begins.

The action, lines, and comedy in the train scene (set to the William Tell Overture) was so well timed. I couldn't stop laughing.

Tonto's story is sad and explains his strange behavior and vendetta toward the Cavendish gang.

I might have enjoyed it and that is a big might, if I was not comparing it to the legend of the Lone Ranger as I remember it.

The humor in this film is its strength.  There are slapstick, sight gags, and one-liners a'plenty.  And, for us, it really worked.  It went on for about 45 minutes too long, but that seems to be the thing with live-action Disney movies these days.  Long-time fans will be disappointed in the way this movie plays it for laughs most of the time, but as a movie on its own merits, it's not half-bad.

The chemistry between Depp and Hammer is interesting, but does not do much if anything. Also the sound does not have the typical boom a lot of summer blockbusters usually have. Depp is also at his weakest. I do not blame Depp for this.

5823082,2,B00DJYJWVW,"I don't know exactly what the director was intending to present in this movie-- but it certainly wasn't the Lone Ranger.

Excessively sadistic scenes, gross concepts and a slacker ending spoil the good special effects, potential fun and worst of all-- the legend on which this movie is based.  We have here another ""Green Hornet"" idiot-turned-hero-but-still-an-idiot movie.  The Lone Ranger was a strong character of great intelligence and purpose.  This character was more like a clueless bungler being dragged into the role kicking and screaming.  Throughout the movie I kept wondering, ""Who is that masked man?""... because it wasn't the Lone Ranger.

Johnny Depp would have possibly gained some notice here if it were his very first movie ever.  As it is rather than Tonto, we see Captain Jack Sparrow in inexplicably strange ""American Indian"" garb...  and there's nothing his character says to the audience more than ""I'm Johnny Depp in an indian costume"".  Any moment I kept expecting him to go into 1920s comic routines (which they actually arranged in a couple of places...  walking across a ladder between two trains.. etc etc).

This movie had great potential.  The train wreck scene was very well done.  The humor in some places was mildly amusing-- especially making fun of his huge white hat (something which I always thought would make a nice long-distance target for bad guys).  Feeding the crow hat got a little repetitious and added little or no value to the storyline.

It is enjoyable though a little crazy at times.  The original Tonto didn't have a stuffed raven perched on his head, and if he had, he certainly wouldn't have tried to feed it.  Actually this production is a spoof of more serious roles from the original where the Lone Ranger stood for righteous law and order.  He was a hero, not a buffoon who fires a warning shot that caroms off 5 objects to instantly kill a bad guy with a wound to the heart, whereupon Tonto says, ""Um, great shot!""  Once learning the truth, he then says, ""Um, not so great shot!""  I loved this subtle humor and the train scenes are a riot.  Let's just say, you will not be bored and it is perfectly okay for the whole family to watch as there is nothing offensive.  I believe it is a Disney production.

5823137,4,B00DJYJWVW,"When it was released, most critics despised the film. I mean, they hated it. Hated, hated, HATED, everything about this movie. I steered clear of it initially; not because I believed the ""hate-hype,"" but because I was a 21-year-old working minimum wage at Walmart that summer. I didn't have the time or money to go see it in theaters. But I had friends and family who did, and out of their mouths came a different story: The Lone Ranger is actually good. By the time I finally did get around to seeing it (a relative brought the DVD to a Christmas party), I didn't know what to expect: the heaping pile of trash the critics claimed it was; or the funny romp that my friends promised.

I'm still trying to figure out why critics hated it.

Th film follows John Reid, a young lawyer who returns home, and is deputized by his Ranger brother. While out attempting to catch a fugitive outlaw, the posse is gunned down by Cavendash, the man they are hunting. Tonto, an outcast Commanche, comes across their bodies, but finds John still alive. Believing John to be a ""spirit walker,"" Tonto convinces John to don a mask and hunt down Cavendash, and other wrong-doers in the West, as the vigilante known as the Lone Ranger.

First off, this is not classic Lone Ranger. This is definitely a darker tale for the age of ""The Dark Knight,"" but is injected with a fair amount of humor, both self-parody (""Don't ever do that again!"") and straight-faced (""Horse dead!""), and some intense action sequences, particularly the spectacular finale, taking place onboard a pair of runaway trains.

Depp and Armie Hammer play Tonto and Lone Ranger. Their chemistry is reminiscent of buddy-cop movies less like Leathal Weapon, and more like Police Academy. Depp's portrayal of Tonto is essentially Jack Sparrow filtered through a Native American, which isn't nessecarily a bad thing. And he has a bird on his head. The bird has significance to Tonto's story, yes; but leaves the question why it's on his head unanswered. But for a movie like this, the best thing you can do would be to just accept it and move on to the next gag.

In all, the film is far from perfect. There are a few plot holes and ""plot twists"" that don't quite make sense. Some characters are under-utilized, and the film can be quite flippant at times. But this isn't a film made for high-brow cinema; this is like a Michael Bay film: you don't go for the acting, plot, or even for the cinematography; you go because you want to have a good time. The Lone Ranger is popcorn fare at its finest; and if that's all you're looking for, then circle the wagons, gather the family, and pop this in DVD player.",1393372800,3,2648,4.578059071729958
5823138,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Silly me, I listened to the critics and didn't go see this movie in the theatre.  When I finally sat down to watch it on Blue-ray I was pleasantly surprised to find it was a pretty good movie.  Not in the same league as the original Pirates of the Caribbean, but it has some of the same flashes of brilliance...hardly surprising since there were so many who were involved with both movies.

I never really watched the original Lone Ranger, so I had few expectations and took this movie for what it was.  The story is told from Tonto's pov as he relates the origin of the Lone Ranger to a young kid at a Wild West Show years and years later and, along the way, tells his own backstory.  The kid is shocked to find one of the presentations at the show involves a live--if very old and very odd--person who tells him to never take off his mask and treats the stuffed crow on his head as through it were alive.

The story he relates is filled with adventure, danger, good versus evil, and spirit magic...and one of the best magic elements of the story is the white Spirit Horse we all know as Silver.

Some spoilers below:

The story starts with a bad guy being brought to town for justice, a bad guy chained next to Tonto, who calls him a Wendigo, a name for a being who eats other human beings and grows strong because of it.  The bad guy is rescued by his gang and our would-hero sets off with the Texas Rangers, including his brother, to hunt them down.  They make a big mistake and all are killed and Tonto sets about burying them...only to have a pure white Spirit Horse turn up and show him that one of these men is special and is not dead after all.  (The scenes here with the horse are pretty funny.)

Tonto puts a mask on the man, sets him on the Spirit Horse, and they go after the bad guys.  Turns out Tonto has his own agenda, his own quest for revenge going on.  There are hints here and there that the Lone Ranger has become something more than just some guy out for justice, just as Tonto seems very much a shamanic style figure.  Together now, the Lone Ranger begins a journey of discovery of what his new life is about as they fight to protect his brother's wife and child, strive to bring to justice the bad guys, and end the secret machinations of the big shot railroad men.

As this story is being told by Tonto years later, there are times when there are unexplained bits in the movie--which actually make sense since he is relating what amounts to a myth to the kid listening to him--and plenty of magical events, such as the Spirit Horse going where horses cannot go and doing what horses cannot do.  The cuts back and forth between the Wild West Show setting and the real Wild West are very well done.  This is a movie that definitely is about the Myth of the Lone Ranger and Tonto and everything wrapped up with that.

Quite well done for what it is.  Not a brilliant movie, but one I will end up keeping and watching again.  I would have given it 5 stars if some of the subplots hadn't seemed to disappear and if they had brought out more about the Wendigo aspect in the movie...basically made good on the promise of the movie.",1393372800,3,3150,4.260504201680672

5823155,4,B00DJYJWVW,"When I first heard about the Lone Ranger being remade by Disney (and the Pirates of the Caribbean team, no less) I was actually pretty excited.  I love the Pirates movies (mostly) and so I felt pretty good that the movie would be decent.  Not necessarily great, but decent.  Then it hit theaters and it just seemed like the critics and many moviegoers just beat up on it pretty good.  After seeing it I just feel like they couldn't have been more wrong.  People forget that the Lone Ranger was created during the time of the radio serials that spun off into a successful TV show that made for good ""popcorn theater.""  Frankly, that's exactly what this newest incarnation does by carrying on that tradition.  Sure, it puts a modern spin on it, but for the most part it doesn't seem to have a negative effect on the movie overall.

I suppose some of the complaints do originate around the fact that Tonto takes the spotlight more than the Lone Ranger.  I was afraid when the movie first started that was not only going to be the case but that it was going to hurt more than help.  Turns out, it is true he does take a more central role (I mean, it's Johnny Depp, hello?) but the way he does makes total sense for this movie.  This is, in every way, an origins story as told from Tonto's point of view not John Reid's.  So it works.

Bottom line -- this is a humorous, good-old-fashioned romp.  It's not without its faults, certainly (e.g., a bit long on time) but it's a well-done throw back to those popcorn movies of yesteryear.  And do yourself a favor, let it be escapist entertainment as it is intended to be.  Leave any expectations of it being a faithful retelling of the original Lone Ranger story out of the experience of watching this film and you'll walk away having smiled, laughed, cringed, cheered and enjoyed most of what Depp and Hammer have to offer as this oft forgotten duo.",1393200000,8,1891,4.43768115942029

Having now watched this movie, in my opinion every person connected to this film should be hanging their head in shame for this disaster.  What were they thinking??  The story-line is beyond stupid, the characters are too sad to even laugh at or mock, and unless I already knew who the original character The Lone Ranger was I would never want to give that idiot another thought after seeing this portrayal of him.  I would not recommend spending money to watch this movie, it is just too painful to endure.  I like Johnny Depp in general, and I will watch his other movies, but what he did with Tonto's character in this movie is criminal.

5823177,1,B00DJYJWVW,"Every movie needs a character with ""character"" and the character of Lone Ranger played by Hammer has none.  Hammer acting is not in question, rather the script and the presentation of a gutless character with no moral compass.  One moment the Lone Ranger is trying to bring the villain to justice in chains and the next he's leaving Tonto to die.  Also, other characters in the film are of such low moral character its impossible to believe these characters would have develop a trustful relationship with those other presented with high moral fortitude.  The film makes some sense in the end as many things come full circle, but a Jr. High drama student could have written a better script.

The film is not even worth a star, too bad I am required to give it one. I really want my rental fee back. And anyone who rated the film above two stars has serious disillusions on quality scripts, because you want find quality in the this film.

I swore I'd never look at this movie again but after a month or so I watched it once more in the vein it was written and found myself not as hostel and even enjoyed parts of it knowing what to and what not to expect.

This is a bastardization of everything the Lone Ranger ever stood for.  Luckily, Clayton Moore never had to view this.",1392768000,2,487,4.172043010752688

5823234,3,B00DJYJWVW,Jonny Depp is always entertaining and is the lead as the sidekick.  Story was not developed well and demeans the Lone Ranger's aura for those who of us who saw him as a hero.,1392681600,2,174,4.117647058823529
5823235,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Y'know, it's a matter of expectations.  I had no expectations for this movie, and so I enjoyed it.  It was fun, Johnny Depp was his usual quirky self, and everyone else played the foil to his eccentricities.
The other actors ( I guess) were required to play it straight.which actually made them a little boring.  And I really resent that the bad guys didn't meet their final doom thoroughly.  Oh sure, the movie made you think they did.but you didn't actually see it.so that they could resurrect them for a sequel, I suppose.  That ticked me off.  I am getting really tired of that ploy.  It makes the endings of movies very unsatisfying.
But otherwise, Tonto was the whole fun part.  A number of spots where I really chuckled.
As a rental, worth the money.
Oh yeah.my 14 yr old son enjoyed it too.",1392681600,,798,4.493055555555555

5823237,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Good story and fun to watch. Lots of humor. I liked the story and humor the best. The back story as to why Tonto wore the crow on his head was good, The horse was hilarious. And the Lone Ranger was nave in the beginning.",1392681600,3,220,3.911111111111111

And let me tell you, I'm a big fan of Armie Hammer now! Went into this movie not expecting a whole lot and was blown away. After having been raised a fan of the Lone Ranger I was impressed how they told this story. And it was quite refreshing to see a movie that did not have a lot of cursing and sex scenes in it. Loved the way the stunts and horse scenes were performed. You would be about to cry your eyes out one second and be laughing your head off the next. I would highly recommend this movie. And I wished they would make more of them!!!",1392681600,5,682,3.949275362318841

5823244,3,B00DJYJWVW,"I had really looked forward to this movie and overall it was entertaining BUT the mediocre plot and the depiction of the Lone Ranger as a bumbling gun-hating ""hero"" didn't do it for me. I found it a little too quirky for my tastes. Overall, I think this movie didn't even come close to its potential.",1392595200,2,300,4.375
5823245,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I thought this movie was beautifully done. It reflects on deeper issues, while keeping things light, without sugar coating the realities of that time in our country's history. The sets are artful while not distracting from the dialogue. The music, for the most part, was well chosen and placed. The characters where great, and a little campy, without being over-the-top or out-of-place in the context of the film. Some of the scenes with Silver (the horse) were hilarious and had me laughing out loud. There are some brilliant subtleties in this film that have me thinking I will definitely be watching it again to look for the things I missed!

Most of all; I loved the scenes with ancient Tonto and the child. I loved watching this child's imagination unfold. I'm not sure how best to describe this but here is my take on it. The child walks into that Wild West tent as a cynic (or at least beginning the whole santa-claus-isn't-real transition into the tween years) and leaves believing that magic exists in the world and anything is possible! At least that's how I felt after watching this!

There is a scene, while the credits role, that shows ancient Tonto walking out into the desert country. As he walks away,he has an old suit case in hand, he's wearing a faded overcoat and his crow is covered up by a black gentlemen's hat he is wearing. This scene was incredibly poignant, and to me, embodied the genius of this film (those that wanted to see the deeper meaning would and those that wanted to see an old man walking in the desert would). Without one single word of dialogue, the whole enormity of what was done to the native people of this land is expressed in that simple scene. With the ancient Tonto leaving us; so to has a way of life and a people left us. Some things are lost that can never be ""traded"" back.",1392595200,4,1826,4.547112462006079

5823247,4,B00DJYJWVW,"I found it to be a refreshing take on an old classic. The actors were great, the effects were awesome and the storyline kept me waiting to see where it would take me.

5823248,3,B00DJYJWVW,"Johnny Depp is my favorite actor, but I don't like his best known character, the goofy Captain Jack Sparrow.  Tonto is much like Sparrow.  Some parts of this movie are great entertainment, but much of it leaves you saying ""Huh?"".

Johnny Depp was his usual Johnny Depp self and you could see a bit of Jack sparrow in the Tontoe Charter. It was a nice enjoyable movie but no block buster titian so I gave this re-make 4 stars.,1392595200,,307,4.220338983050848

I grew up on the old black and white shows (they were 30+ years old then) and this isn't corny, spaghetti western, and has a number of clever spots.

5823265,4,B00DJYJWVW,"The beautiful West -- the scenery and the animals - provides the hope that surfaces throughout the film, but the movie, in my opinion, is about the omnipresent fate that came upon the child Tonto and remains his lifelong companion, a fate symbolized by the crow/raven he wears - a fate made possible by terrible criminals: gunmen and businessmen who exploited the West and harmed all animals and all peoples of all cutlures with great impunity.

The movie, therefore, creates a lonely feeling tied to Nature's vulnerability and to human vulnerability, accompanied by horrific wounds at all levels -- emotional, spiritual, and physical.

The movie was made by master film-makers, writers, and actors, and it is well worth viewing.  The frequent plot departures into slapstick and farce are not unwelcome and keep the movie from becoming too sombre and self-absorbed.  There are many comical and entertaining episodes with characteristically delightful one-liners from Johnny Depp.

The horrific brutality and train wrecks, however -- with plunges of train cars into water and underwater scenes of the dying ""villain"" -- are not typical of the genre of Western films that most people might expect in a re-make of the Lone Ranger.

It is not a movie about the power of virtue to overcome evil.  All victories are puchased at great cost -- like that of the Alamo.  It is not a movie for young children to view alone -- or at all.",1392508800,2,1425,4.933054393305439

you  might  face  a employee  whom  you  must  fire , and distroy  their  life in  one  or two  hours.

5823269,5,B00DJYJWVW,"It was one of the most clever and entertaining movie I have seen in a long time.  I was and still am upset that ""the Critics"" and movie reviews tore the movie apart.  Along with the actors.  It was a fantasy western,  It had all the action, humor, gore and interesting story line that makes a good movie. And as they stated, it was Tontos version of how the Lone Ranger came to be.  If it had Brad Pitt (World War Z - disgusting) in the movie...or George Clooney (Gravity - boring)  It would have been a box office smash.  I enjoyed this movie so much, I bought my whole family their own copy for x-mas (8) and I have watched it quite a few times just to enjoy the scenes again.  What a movie.  Not to mention, I grew up listening to the Lone Ranger and other stories on the radio back in the good old days.  In fact, with just the radio....I thought it was the Long Ranger for the longest time HA.
Yes, I give it 5 stars and I believe there are hundreds of thousands of us that do. And thanks to Amazon, I have never been disappointed in any of the items I order and the way Amazon handles their business.

I say almost, because it did come alive during the last 20 minutes, and the William Tell Overture sequence although not completely in the mood of the original was truly exciting and enjoyable watching.  However, it wasn't quite good enough to make sitting through the whole two and a half hours worth while.",1392249600,2,354,4.883333333333334

5823286,5,B00DJYJWVW,Have become a great fan of Johnny Depp's features and once again he has come through with a delightful retelling the Story of The Long ranger from his point of view as Tonto. Great addition to my Video Library.,1392249600,3,210,4.410256410256411

5823288,1,B00DJYJWVW,Wow what a waste of this actor talent; if Disney wanted a farce they did not go far enough; if they wanted drama they did not develope the story well; what they got was a failed comedy,1392249600,2,184,4.0
5823289,3,B00DJYJWVW,"I understand that the movie is based on an old TV series.  However, I felt like it could be more culturally sensitive.  I can't complain though, it had Johnny Depp!",1392249600,3,164,4.433333333333334

5823292,1,B00DJYJWVW,this is the worst movie Depp has ever done-tho he was his usual talented interesting self in it--the story line is awful-the Lone Ranger is a cowardly wimp--I didn;t even watch the entire thing-I couldn't quite stand the see the end of it--might have skipped about 15 minutes so I did give it  a fair chance--I just can't believe the critics were right this time-those guys are usually so wrong LOL,1392249600,2,398,4.605633802816901
5823293,2,B00DJYJWVW,"I was disappointed with this movie.  The whole storyline did not seem to be serious, as I believe is necessary for a western.  Tonto seemed more of a running joke throughout the movie.  The worst thing is that he had a good backstory, they just did not utilize it like they should have.",1392249600,2,286,4.3584905660377355

5823296,3,B00DJYJWVW,"Yes.  I know everyone loves, loves this picture.  I do not!  I gave it 3 stars because it has its entertaining parts.  But I am furious that this beloved story was twisted so badly!

This IS a vehicle for Johnny Depp, not for The Lone Ranger legend.  If you love Johnny D. then you will probably love this.

I am furious over the way they portrayed Tonto, faithful companion to the Lone Ranger.  What a twisted piece of junk!
I am furious that they portrayed the character of the Lone Ranger as a wimp -- a coward!  The two of them together were heroes to me!

This is so like the Disney Productions of this generation -- to warp everything it can!

IF they had put this out as a comedy, I might have liked it.  It was put out as Action/Adventure/Western.  There are those of us who loved The Lone Ranger stories who know what a such a movie of those genres would most likely be.  If I had watched this in a theater, I would have gotten up and walked out!  There ARE still some things that have real meaning to some of us these days!

Was there comedy in this show.  Yes.  There was enough action to hold one's attention.  But, this show was entitled, ""The Lone Ranger.""  As such is is a convoluted piece of _ _ _ _ in my opinion!  It should have been entitled, ""Johnny Depp and whoever.""  I would not have wasted my money on it otherwise.  I am so disgusted with Disney!",1392163200,3,1371,4.168582375478927

5823308,3,B00DJYJWVW,"I had to watch this with my mom JUST to see if it lived up to its infamy.  It did-- and more.  I actually appreciated the artistic, strange quality of the film.  But, Depp and Hammer's relationship is never truly defined and is never fully solidified.  Are they friends?  Foes?  Brothers?  Is it a Bromance?  Can't tell.  And, I don't want to have to sit through a 3-hour movie wondering if the 2 main characters hate or love each other.  I don't have time for that.  But, I do appreciate the film for its strangeness, the setting, and that darn black crow perched on Depp's head is the coolest.",1392076800,3,595,4.36697247706422

5823310,3,B00DJYJWVW,"I mean, it was somewhat entertaining, but it was a little ridiculous. And the Lone Ranger character was hard to ""get behind"" because he was annoying. My husband and I both lost interest and fell asleep before the end.",1392076800,2,217,4.589743589743589
5823311,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Yes, it's the Lone Ranger but NOT a re-make of the original.  One must look at this version with different eyes.  Viewing this production is entertaining on it's own merits.

He had no essence to the character. But other than that it was a really good movie. I didn't understand why this movie so called bombed at the box office. I am hoping for a sequel based on how the movie ended. But with the poor success of this one in the theater I doubt that will happen.",1391990400,,443,4.103448275862069

5823317,4,B00DJYJWVW,"I would recommend this for a weekend rental.  It is helpful to know a bit of the old series to get some of the jokes, but not necessary.  It takes some license with the original story, but in a way that still entertains.  Go into it with an open mind and you'll enjoy it.  If you're a die hard and expect the series, you could be disappointed.  Both actors give a decent performance and the story line has a nice twist.",1391990400,5,419,4.1234567901234565

5823320,5,B00DJYJWVW,"This is more of a comedy than a tribute to the old Lone Ranger.  The action was non-stop, and the lines were funny.

5823322,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Excellent story line and great special effects. One of the most enjoyable parts of watching this was the attempt to follow how things really were in the ""old west"" during the era. Acting was good and I'm not sure if they director was trying to make the movie comedic or the drama it was. There were great elements of comedy but the depth of some of the graphic violence belied the ""fun"" of other parts of the movie. I don't have any suggestion as to how they could have made it better this is just an observation. I would watch it again if that is any indication of how much I liked it.",1391990400,3,586,4.1946902654867255

5823324,3,B00DJYJWVW,"For those who remember the TV series, be prepared for WTF moments.  The LR wears his Texas Rangers badge, has a horse that is ""other-worldly,"" is out for revenge, and ends up not quite the ""knight in white.""

Tonto is also out for revenge, and enlightenment.  He is just as much of a ""caricature"" of an Indian as the original Tonto...without the Hollywood fake broken English.

This movie tries to be funny and serious, and really misses most of the time.

It did have  a nice resurrection of the  theme (William Tell Overture).  It actually seemed like Hans Zimmer would have composed this, himself, for this movie.  This was actually a ""miss"" for Jerry Bruckheimer, who is usually right on target with his films.",1391990400,2,714,4.693548387096774

5823372,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I don't think I watched the same movie as some of the reviewers on here. I watched a movie where Tonto told his version of the story, where Tonto is Johnny Depp. So of course it's not the ""classic"" Lone Ranger! In this version, Tonto tries to make himself the hero, saving the Lone Ranger and making him who he is. It's like a guy at a bar telling a story and embellishing it. Keep that in mind as you watch.

However, even though this is Tonto's story, I thought Armie Hammer was the real star. Johnny Depp was kind of just his usual oddball self. So yeah, his stuff was kind of funny, but in that scratch your head and wonder kind of funny. Armie Hammer was hilarious and totally believable as a city-boy-turned-butt-kicker who still maintains his principles in the face of savagery. A true hero.

This is definitely a movie that requires suspension of disbelief, but I got over that at the very beginning when the scene was supposed to be in Texas and was very obviously Arizona. But it kind of made it more fun and helped me keep in mind that this was Tonto telling a ridiculous story to a kid who wouldn't know any better. I'm really glad that they chose to film in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, because those are all much more scenic than west Texas, and the movie really shows off the beauty in these states. It was also fun to see places in a movie that I'd been to myself.

Bottom line, this is a ridiculous cheesy movie that is great fun. It's refreshing to have an adult comedy that has a great story and is smart rather than crude.",1391558400,3,1554,4.315068493150685
5823373,1,B00DJYJWVW,"It's crappy on all levels. Bad history, bad attempt to resurrect an iconic fictional figure, bad geography, bad direction, bad acting, horrible plot line. Just plain dumb. The only thing worth seeing Depp's portrayal of the half-crazy native american. His delivery of a comically-scripted character varies from smile-worthy, to down-right hilarious. But if you edited it down to just those bits, it would only be a few minutes. The rest of the film is a waste of your time and you'll feel much dumber for having watched it.",1391558400,,523,4.954545454545454

5823383,3,B00DJYJWVW,"I've grown far too tired of politically correct Hollywood films.  Even though a decent, if a bit overblown, action film, I've growing tired of Hollywood's slavish committment to political correctness.  While I think it was good to flesh out Tonto and make him a true partner to the Lone Ranger, this could have been done without diiminishing the Lone Ranger character.  Instead, as with ""the Green Hornet"", the title hero is just some stupid white guy buffoon who amounts to nothing until his ethnic sidekick teaches him to fight.  While the Ranger catches on quickly, he really didn't need to start out as a fool.

Second problem in my mind was the identity issue.  One of the main points of being the lone ranger was that no one really knows who he is.  In this movie, everyone knows who he is.  There really was no need to wear the mask.

More political correctness comes in the form of the indians and the millitary.  Simply said: military bad; indians good.  The military guys are doing the bidding of the bad guys and therefore are villians.  Unlike the actual military in the Indian wars, they were all white.  In the real Indian wars, many were African Americans-the so called ""buffalo soldiers""- but to include them would break Hollywood racial sterotypes so the military is portrayed as all white and all bad.  The Indians are the good guys, but, in this movie, they are stupid.  The plains Indians were some of the best guerilla fighters in history, using hit and run tactics and never attacking positions of overwhelming force.  Yet, the Indians in this movie charge right into the gatling guns and are slaughtered.  Real Commaches would not have been that stupid.

Finally, however, I must give one compliment.  When the action scenes start up, the William Tell overture roars in the background.  This is a vast improvement over the many dorky Hollywood films that do a remake of a classic then blast some goofy rap theme in the background.  They did get the music right in this film, even if many things were wrong.

This is not a bad film.  There is plenty of action.  However, I am tired of the modern Hollywood stereotypes and the belittling of all that was once respected in our society.  I have a feeling there are quite a few people who feel similarly, and they just don't go to the movies all that much anymore.  Hollywood hasn't lost their audience; they have driven them away.",1391472000,3,2399,4.665871121718377

If the same comedic moments were woven into a slightly more serious plot (the hero never shoots and kills a bad guy in the current flick), this movie could have been four or five stars.

5823394,2,B00DJYJWVW,"Yeesh what a stinker. Gets 2 stars for the production values, all the CGI and action scenes look great.

This movie was probably written by twenty-something year old dopes who neither know or care about the original characters. You'll thrill to the excitement!
See:
--Silver, the magical horse who can get on top of buildings and trains perhaps by way of unicorn wings
--A Lone Ranger who is inept, bumbling, stupid, feckless and incapable of vanquishing his enemies. No bad guy could ever be afraid of him or have any respect for him.
--A Tonto who spouts dialogue so ridiculous, so out of line with anything an 1800's Indian would say that you'll wonder why you kept watching the film.
--a beginning and an ending set in some sort of wild west museum, complete with aged Tonto who transforms from a statue to a real person, and then changes his clothes and disappears.

All the money they spent on making this wasted with a dumb plotline. Could have been, should have been so much better.
But maybe if Disney turns it into another ride at the overpriced magic kingdom, they can make some of their money back.",1391385600,2,1110,4.629441624365482

5823405,2,B00DJYJWVW,Johnny Depp was certainly entertaining as Tonto but the themes of the Lone Ranger did not even resemble the Classic TV series.  There was animosity rather than loyalty between Lone Ranger and Tonto.  It was more of a comic/modernized look at Lone Ranger and did not have many similarities to the beloved TV series.,1391385600,,314,4.796296296296297

Well, how can anyone seriously be entertained with all the blame, hatred and utter self-loathing type of racism this film spues?  It's unbelievable; it's political correctness on steroids.

There is also no real plot to this story, and the film goes on and on and on......and on....aimlessly.  You have no character here to connect with.  The charter of Tonto is too aloof and the Lone Ranger is a complete buffoon!  This is western version of ""The Green Hornet"" film - no it's worse, add Will Smith's ""The Wild, Wild West"" film to the ""Green Hornet"" film and you get this horrid movie called, ""The Lone Ranger""!

For us it was nostalgic, educational, fitting for a favorite actor, and was regionally appealing.  Nostalgia  ...  Our ages are 60 and 58 so we grew up with the Ranger.  Chills went up and down the spine each time the theme song cranked up.  Education ...  We learned from this movie the origin of The Ranger and the mask and why he became the mysterious hero that he was.  A favorite actor, Johnny Tonto Depp ...  This was a vintage JD role.  It was a much different picture and interpretation of the Tonto we knew, but a perfect quirky role for JD.  Finally,  Personal Regional Interest. ...  Much of the film was filmed on location in New Mexico and Colorado, especially the train and tunnel sequences.  The tunnel was built just outside of Creede,Co and some of the train scenes were shot in the San Louis valley which is our home-away-from-home.  It made watching the film fun for us as we spotted familiar bits of scenery that we love.  PS ... The story also struck a note with the setting in Texas, even though the merging of the intercontinental railway was historically was no where near Texas.

I suspect that his father (who started New York's communist party) had some influence.  Unfortunately for me, I am old enough to have watched the original series as a kid, to see the destruction of the story. My 13 and 16 year old kids think the story is

5823444,4,B00DJYJWVW,"This review originally appeared on Micechat

George: There was a lot of hype for the big screen adaptation of the Lone Ranger,  unfortunately, the initial press and fan reviews were pretty scathing. I chose to forgo seeing it in the theater because of the reviews and because its a western. Not a big fan of those.

Jeff: I guess, for me at least, this was a perfect case of judging a book by its cover. Because of the negative press coverage, it left a sour taste in my mouth before even seeing the film. But once my family sat down to watch it, I have to admitI loved it. Like, a lot.

George: My brother asked me how it compared to John Carter and it was almost a toss-up for me. I think the Lone Ranger, as a character, was easier to connect with but the story was still not quite there. That being said, it was a fun popcorn flick with some devastatingly beautiful backdrops. The stunts were pretty spectacular, as well.

Jeff: Oh yeah, the look of the film was fantastic. I was really blown away by some of the camera movements and angles. It truly made the wild west come alive. I didn't have as much of a problem as George did with the characters. The story was pretty straight forward, almost a revenge tale for both of the leads. As much flack as Johnny Depp got in the press for his portrayal of Tonto, I mostly believed it. And of course, being the big star that he is, the story sort of revolved and bookended with him. My main issue with the film WERE these book end sections. Making the entire film a flashback, with an older Tonto telling it to a young boy, seemed kind of unnecessary to me.

George: It was unnecessary and unexpected. It seemed like they were trying to tie it into a the popularity of the Lone Ranger from that time period. What surprised me is how excited I got from hearing the William Tell Overture. It also disappointed me a little because my kids had no idea what the theme music was from or what it meant. Could that have been one of the issues with the film? That more modern audiences have no cultural history of the LoneRanger with which to associate?

Jeff: Funny enough, Alex DID know of the song at tenbut not related to The Lone Ranger. But I was glad I didn't have to explain it to him, and he did seem to enjoy every time it started to play. Aside from the film itself, there are a handful of extras on the disc. There is one featuring Armie Hammer, who plays the titular character, as he documents the making of the film. There is also a making of featurette, dealing with a lot of the special effects, and a pretty amusing blooper reel.

George: I crack up every time I see his name: Armie Hammer. Hahahaha. Ok. Back to the review. I was still trying to put my finger on why the film didn't do better at the box office. Most people I talked to enjoyed it, but didn't have anything memorable to say about the film. Ive thought about it quite a bit because my 10 year-old left the room about halfway through and didn't want to watch any more of it. He just said that he didn't like it. Still, I enjoyed it, but wasn't super excited about it or felt the need to watch it again.

Jeff: I don't know why I feel like Im in the opposite camp of you, since were usually on the same page about this stuff. I honestly would watch it again in a heartbeat. And then again, with the commentary. To me, this is easily the type of movie that could be played over and over again in my house. The only downside that could prevent some parents from letting their kids see it is the violence. While nothing is TOO bad, it does seem pretty violent for a Disney film, and could raise some questions the kids might ask. The whole wendigo subplot comes to mind",1391126400,,3688,4.249643366619115

Only the true hardcore fans went to go see it. What a shame. It's a visual spectacle, with brilliant stunts and special effects. Armie Hammer is adorable. Johnny Depp.....well is Johnny Depp. Helena Bonham Carter, not in it as much as I would have liked, but she's magnificent, because, she just is. The rest of the cast, all brilliant, right down to the meanest scoundrel. My only complaint is..............there will probably be no sequel, because of those, no fun critics.

5823463,2,B00DJYJWVW,"One can understand where director Gore Verbinski wanted to go with this movie.  Rather than pay homage to the television and film series of the past, he wanted to use the story to make a comment on the status of Native Indians, and how their cultures were brutally extinguished by the seemingly endless tide of 'progress,' symbolized by the railway.  In this new world of capitalism, concepts of 'good' and 'evil' didn't really hold sway; money was all that mattered.  This helps to explain why Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) and Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) wield such power in this world.  The Lone Ranger (Armie Hammer) and Tonto (Johnny Depp), might still be able to right wrongs, and restore some kind of moral order, but their influence on the wider picture is negligible.  They represent a long-departed world of honor, good fellowship and justice - values that simply do not exist in the capitalist world-view.  However many of these very important thematic points are lost in a film which is structurally a mess; it doesn't know whether it is trying to be a comedy, an historical drama, an hommage to the television series, or all three.  The plot meanders along at a snail's pace, and although there are some spectacular CGI-generated sequences, the characterization remains at a superficial level. Depp gives his usual flashy performance as Tonto; one might argue that it is a good example of mimicry, prompting us to ask why the role was not played by a Native Indian.  Hammer is colorless as the Lone Ranger; in truth, Depp might have been better suited to this role.  Wilkinson gives his usual scene-stealing role as the bad guy, although he is really only reprising the role of Pecksniff from MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT, with an American accent added.",1391040000,,1760,4.898989898989899

I don't think it stayed true to the legend of the Lone Ranger or Tonto but I was impressed with the Tonto character as played by Johnny Depp.  I think too much time was spent on the beginning and not enough time was dedicated to the Lone Ranger as he eventually became.  It was as though they were planning a sequel to finish developing the characters so this was just an introduction. There was a lot going on in this movie so we plan to see it again.  This movie had a lot of possibilities that didn't happen, I think the biggest disappointment for people is that they go in expecting to see the original Lone Ranger instead of some Eastern Dude dressed in a cowboy outfit. AH did not do the Lone Ranger Justice.  That doesn't mean he did a bad job acting.  The part didn't fit the purpose of the real Lone Ranger.

It's silly with over-the-top impossible action sequences, sure, but at least I didn't see superheros and super-villains throwing one another through buildings for an hour or more.  Yes, this film is offensive for its portrayal of ""Native American mysticism"" and its marginalization of the genocide brought against Native Americans to a single action sequence preparing us for the film's grande finale.  But even these problematic issues can be accepted in the overall clear-cut good-versus-evil scope of the film.  And Depp does bring a certain depth to his role that many might overlook.  If you want to be offended, there's much here to offend.  If you want good guys versus bad guys in rip-roaring, leather-slapping style, then, hi-ho, Silver!

5823541,4,B00DJYJWVW,"I gave this movie four stars because though I thought it was a great movie, Historical inaccuracies  near the end of the film cost
me giving it five.  The special effects were outstanding, the action good after the movie got going, the train sequences were excellent,
and the cast-acting was splendid.  I got this mainly to see Depp, though I think he is brain dead in real life, on the silver screen he
is one of the best.  Watch him in SLEEPY HOLLOW or in FROM HELL.  The lone ranger character was good, though perhaps a
little wimpy.  Perhaps this is Hollywierds was of making up for all the Indians killed the  1950s.  Make the Indian sidekick the smart one.
.  Anyhow, it worked well,  Being a fanatical admirer of steam locomotives, I especially enjoyed the rail road scenes.  The
producers seemed to pay attention to detail on the trains, using the correct type of couplers on the cars, though I thought I could
see air brake shoes on the locomotives.  In 1869 an engineer would stop a train by throttling down  and/or engaging the reversing
gear.  And a Trainman would rotate the manual brake wheels on the roofs of the box cars or brake wheels on the passenger cars.
Westinghouse invented the air brakes that are still in use today on some trains.
  Also the passenger cars were period correct types.  The principle loco used in the movie had a straight up smoke stack, indicating
it burned coal not wood.  Wood burning locos had the funnel shaped stack.  The principle loco also had 6 driver wheels, unusual
at that time: the standard American loco was a 4-4-0 configuration with 4 drivers.  Still, very handsome locos, helped build this
country.
  I was disturbed with the violence at the end of the film regarding the battle between the US soldiers and the Indians.  It pained
me to see all those  young men on both sides dying.  The effects were good and the train race at the end was very effective.
I hope the crash was cgi and not a real loco smashed up.  And a very nice rail road bridge crash.
  All in all a very worthy film and anybody who likes action and see the good guys win in the end will like  this.  Like all my DVDs
I got this at Amazon.  And another great thing; no DR SWEETS!! in this film.  Have fun, its worth it.",1390694400,,2246,4.428921568627451

Johnny Depp (one of, if not the most, under-rated actors in the world) did a hilarious turn as Tonto.  I don't know if feeding the dead crow on his head peanuts was his adlibbing but it was genius.

This film brings the legend to life through brand-new eyes of Disney for this generation.

This product comes with a Blu-ray, DVD, and digital version allowing its viewing anywhere.  Although this film has outstanding stunning visuals and vast expanses of the iconic American West, there seems to be some confusion in the geographic location of events in history.  The Trans-continental merger of railroads was in Promontory Point in North Utah not Monument Valley or Texas.  The movie is action-packed with fabulous photography and wonderful stunts, but the inserted humor is not consistent with ""The Lone Ranger.""  They have transformed this America mythical hero into the recently disappointingly recreated ""(2011) Green Hornet"" and ""(1999) James West of Wild Wild West"" which also bombed at the box office.  Although I feel Mr. Moore would not approve of this film version, I did very much enjoy the William Tell Overture at the beginning of the film and at the end.

The ""Generation X Creators"" need to get with it on these iconic American sagas. Disney needs to step-up on iconic American heroes even though they are fictional. The world is watching.",1390694400,2,1398,5.100877192982456

Although I was in cramed into an over booked uncomfortable plane, the time went by fast and I was actually concerned that the flight would end before the movie did.

The movie was a sleeper I feel because it was not properly marketed. First of all you have to like westerns. When I pulled the trigger to get the movie I had no Idea as to whether I would like it or not. Sometimes taking chances pay off. The lone ranger turned out to be one of my better choices.

It was also very funny and several places that we were laughing until my cheeks hurtjust enjoy the movie as a GREAT escape and don't over think it.  I think this is the sleeper of the year!

The only people I know who gave this a good review were people in the movie Industy and had a vested interest in this movie being watched.  It simple was awful.  From the dead bird on Tonto's head to the carnivorous rabbits.  Was this movie made to destroy every fun memory of our childhood?  It seems that was its only purpose.

I like westerns with historic scenes and historic background, though the scenes weren't in Texas but were in Arizona.  The show was funny and the characters  great.

5823579,4,B00DJYJWVW,"We enjoyed this movie a lot but not nearly as much as we expected to. All of our favorite scenes and dialogue involved Tonto's short, clever onen-liners (There is something very wrong with that horse). what I suspect we are witnessing in this installment is a brilliant and fully fleshed out platform for at least 2 sequels-- probably 3 or 4. I say that because this one completely explains where both our heros come from, morally and otherwise. We also witness the transformation of the main character from a trusting, naeive proponent of 'civilization and social development' with it's established 'legal system' to the hero we love because he now actively pursues justice against tough odds. Those are the movies I'm sure I will rate with 5 stars and by then I will appreciate the effort that went into building the back-story so those sequels can focus on The Lone Ranger as we love him... the man who brings swift and decisive justice to situations otherwise ruled by heartless outlaws! I highly recommend owning this film with the intent of having the whole story once Gore Verbinski finishes the entire chronicle.",1390521600,,1120,4.869109947643979

It's a creative back-story to the adventure I expected. Very well written, but it left me wishing there was more action (and less talk) from the masked man... more raw skill and more self-conflict for a convincing action hero. Silver (the horse) was too magical and came across as unbelievable even for a child's imagination. I wanted to see the Lone Ranger take charge of his destiny and bring the wicked to justice, but mostly it was Tonto, incredible luck and a spirit-horse running the show.

5823636,5,B00DJYJWVW,"This movie is one of the reasons why I don't listen to the critics.  We all watched this over the holiday break and we all loved the movie.  Both my husband and I grew up watching the series every Sunday morning and looked forward to seeing this adaptation of the series.  My 19 and 22 year old had no idea about the series but loved the movie.  Although this is a long movie, it moves incredibly fast and is highly entertaining.  As usual Johnny Depp did an amazing job and I was surprised by Armie Hammer's performance.  He was excellent.  All the actors did a great job but William Fichtner is awesome!  I loved how this was written for the big screen.  The storyline was excellent.  Gore Verbinski did an outstanding job as Director.  The stunts were absolutely amazing and Depp and Hammer had a great rapport and were very funny together.  The main reason why this movie works for me is they filmed on location mostly in New Mexico and Arizona, etc. and it reminded me of the old westerns filmed on location.  So the cinematography was stunning!  Can't wait to see it again!  Highly recommend.",1390262400,2,1098,4.50253807106599
5823637,4,B00DJYJWVW,"The story is mostly told as a flashback by an old Indian standing in a diorama with the dead crow on his head.

John Reid (Armie Hammer) is a nave counselor trained in the East to think like John Locke. He is coming back home to the West. He meets bad guys and believes that they can be reasoned with without weapons. As he learns better he is assisted on how the world works by a strange Indian dressed up as a medicine man; we learn his name is Tonto (Johnny Depp.) John Reid learns that you cannot trust old friends; you cannot change old loves, and sometimes force needs to be matched with cunning. Eventually John Reid should become the Lone Ranger that we all came to expect.

The characters are where the dichotomy lies. Instead of being a loyal sidekick Tonto leads a world of his own which includes his own agenda and personality explanation. John Reid even though quoting Locke starts off more as a version of Dudley Do-Right. Even his horses smarter just as Dudley's horse was smarter. I think they might have drawn a little on Dudley for some of the scenes.

Saginaw Grant plays a pivotal role as Chief Big Bear. He fills in the Back-story Tonto's life, explains what the story is all about, and does the right thing in handling the future of John Reid and Tonto.

If you come to this movie with no expectations and appreciate Johnny Depp's sense of humor, then you will have a good time watching this movie.

If you get most DVD versions then there will be an extra ""making of"" section that can add to the understanding of what they are trying to present.",1390262400,3,1568,4.411764705882353

Accept that and you will enjoy the ride. The cinematography was outstanding. Appreciated was the lack of in-your-face violence, though there was plenty of violence. Also appreciated was the comic moments. There were times when the burst of laughter from the audience was needed to break up the tension. There was no specific thing that I didn't like about the movie once I relaxed and didn't compare it to the ""real"" Lone Ranger movies.

Three hours of gratuitous brutality, ridiculous special effects and beyond super human feats of immortality mask the sad reality that this comedy isn't funny and the heroes aren't heroic.  The screenwriter and director forgot that hundreds of explosions, murders and moronic one-liners don't make a fun or interesting story.  I'm so glad the American audience rejected this film at the box office.  I wish I'd accepted their critique and not wasted my money watching it here on Amazon.  Only Johnny Depp disciples and murder and violence worshipers rave about this masochistic mess.  Cross-dressing and cannibalistic cowboys just aren't humorous or antagonistic.  They're perversely strange, pathetic efforts that treat the audience as if they are too stupid to notice that these moviemakers have forgotten that they're in the entertainment business.  The sub-genre of mere mortals possessing impervious, ultra-superhero characteristics has been so overdone; and without good storytelling all the outrageous CG conjuring in Hollywood won't make a blockbuster out of a dud.

Yes...there are some goofy moments between Hammer & Depp...but it was needed...to lighten the movie...because it was so dark...especially the Indian massacre with the Gatling gun....the Indians never stood a chance.

my grandfather grew up with the original Lone Ranger serials on tv.
honestly, i didn't think i'd be too big of a fan either and i have to say that yes, maybe the character was a little outdated for the 21st century, but the film did a great justice.
the action was awesome, the characters were great and though i agree it may have been a bit campy or cheesy in some of the dialogue, i thought it was altogether a great film.
critics don't like anything anyways because they suck!!!,

5823706,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I don't know why it didn't do that well at the box office but I believe DVD sales are going to make a huge profit.  I'm a film school student at the Univ of Colo.  This is a beautifully shot movie, on Kodak film.  I did like the approach the screenwriters took to the story.  They did follow the original story line and how the Lone Ranger came to be.  Johnny Depp really does work as Tonto.  He does give the character more depth and humor.  His character is NOT a repeat of Captain Jack.  Armie Hammer does approach his character in a common sense way, with doubt and naivety along with humor until he realizes he is the good amidst all the greed and evil around him.  He then realizes he does have the power and ability to change things.  Hans Zimmer has composed another winner with this score.  He took the classical theme piece, reworked it a little by adding a Western sound at the right places.  The William Tell Overture is a driving piece on it's own and a great composition.  Zimmer takes it and extends it masterfully.  Even the bullet hits on the train window is in perfect time with the music.  A very subtle addition but shows the attention to detail by the editor of the movie.  There is not a better fight train scene than in this movie.  The pacing is fast and on the edge of your seat viewing. I really hope that there is a sequel to this movie.  I'm sure there won't be because it was a very expensive movie to make and didn't do well at the box office in the US.  Every movie has its flaws and I despise film critics.  When it all comes down to it, enjoying a movie is just personal taste.  Just like ice cream, we all like it but like different flavors.  I liked this movie and was highly entertained by it.  I'm 61 years old and grew up with The Lone Ranger on TV.  I'm back in college because I retired from the Army, three Iraq tours, and went back to college to finally finish my degree in Film and TV.  The education I'm getting teaches me to see things in film, set decoration, music, various shots and acting techniques.  There isn't any nudity or foul language in this film.  There is a little blood but no gore.  I like a movie like that.  There is no movie that needs to use the F bomb.

And I thought Johnny Depp had nothing new to offer... again I was wrong.  Johnny Depp was funny.  Tonto's bird on his head from the poster didn't make sense until you've watched the movie.  And the many clues sprinkled throughout the movie come together in the end.

Highly recommended!

CONS: There are some violent scenes so only children 12 and older is appropriate.

5823724,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Don't know why so many people have panned this movie -- Johnny Depp's performance is on a par with his Jack Sparrow performances and the script is just as campy -- those Tonto lines and moments alone make this film enjoyable and well worth seeing.  While the story line is predictable and sometimes painful, THAT IS WHAT THE SPAGHETTI WESTERNS WERE, folks!!  This is part satire and part nostalgia for a simpler era, a momentary glimpse back to the innocence of childhoods where the Lone Ranger episode was the highlight of the week.  My husband is only in his fifties but still remembers listening to radio episodes of the original, and he LOVED this film.  I couldn't bring that nostalgia to my watching of the movie, but I do love the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, and this delivered in the exact same way.  Add FABULOUS costumes, larger-than-life action on a par with the Bond movies, great cinematography and great performances also by Armie Hammer & Helena Bonham Carter, and you have a great package.  OF COURSE it's larger-than-life.  It's a tall tale, an action film, a spoof and a comedy rolled into one.  All of those criticisms could be slapped on the Pirates franchise, too.  Nobody seemed to care there.  If you like Pirates, if you like Depp, there's no reason not to love this movie.  Oh, one last thing -- the technique of using an elderly Tonto narrating in flashbacks is brilliant, and adds the literary aspect of the possibly unreliable narrator, which could account for the tall tale nature of the story.  Maybe that was too subtle and required too deep an analysis for the critics.  JUST WATCH FOR THE FUN OF IT!",1390003200,,1640,4.6923076923076925

Like many I'm sure,  I was hoping for a straight, no nonsense take on the Lone Ranger, giving this long repressed character the  resurgence he needed. This was not to be. It seemed every few seconds you could see a purposeful setup for an intended laugh, but what came instead was a mockery of the characters, forcing an under the breath,"" oh
geez"".

Why filmmakers  would destroy such rich material is beyond comprehension . The start of  the movie was a clear giveaway that I was about to witness a bomb. What a horrible segway, and absolutely childish as well. Depp actually had a good voice for Tonto but nothing could save his vaudeville style portrayal of an American Indian.

 The actor that attempted an embodiment of the Lone Ranger himself is hardly worth mentioning. The  only adjective coming to mind is ""pathetic"". What a waste of energy , costumes and sets. It's hard these days when there is so much ability to produce fine films about characters as classic as the Lone Ranger, only to be given shear garbage.

Obviously, the film is not meant to be an accurate portrayal of the old TV show, nor of Western geography. You're supposed to be in TX, but there's Monument Valley, AZ and you turn the corner and it's Mesa Verde, CO. lol, what can I say, it's Disney. Great movie.",1389830400,3,546,4.405940594059406

5823744,3,B00DJYJWVW,"I HAD BIG HOPES when I heard the creative crew behind Disneys Pirates of the Caribbean franchise planned to reboot this Western classic with executive producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski, and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, to star Johnny Depp.

I love Westerns. From Shane to Tombstone, Im there. And so I was for The Lone Ranger, but what a mess. Its not so much a bad Western as plain old bad story-telling.

Any genre movie can be ruined by an excess of subplots and useless characters  like the madam played by Helena Bonham Carter, who makes a big show of her trick leg made of scrimshawed whale bone. It comes in handy in an end stunt, but other than that, shes got nowhere to go and nothing to do. General Custer appears midway, again demonstrating what an insufferable ass he was. (The film is loaded with clichs.) Depps Tonto, shown as an old man in a carnival show, narrates the story in a way to delay or break action. His make-up makes sense but stays in place throughout all calamities; we all know the stuff just doesn't work that way. When the real Native Americans show up, it makes Depps Tonto less than genuine, despite his heritage. Worst of all, Armie Hammers Lone Ranger spends so much time being a comic doofus, he never makes a credible transition to hero. Theres no chemistry between Depp and Hammer. Mean jokes, yes; chemistry, no.

A personal gripe is the ugly thugs who like to wear bits of ladys clothing. It wasn't that funny in the Caribbean and falls flat here.

Still, the good stuff is very good. Tonto has a heartbreaking and believable backstory. Bruckheimer and Verbinski give us some fun through big-time stunts, many of which have that comic edge we saw in Pirates. The villain is a nightmare: Butch Cavandish, a scar-faced bandit cannibal played by William Fichtner. Tonto tells John Reid (Hammer), the Lone Ranger-in-training, that Cavandish is a wendigo, a creature from Native American lore described as a man who becomes a demon from eating human flesh. Theres a missing scene between Tonto and John Reid after we learn more about the Rangers sidekick.

Thats the kind of juice that could have given this reboot a genuine kick.

Its easy to like Hammer, the actor. He is so enthusiastic, taking us through the Armies Western Roadtrip extra, giving a tour of shooting locations in New Mexico. Becoming a Cowboy shows how the actors learned to ride a horse, use a lariat and fire weapons in Cowboy Boot Camp. Riding the Rails of The Lone Ranger demos how to shoot action scenes atop moving trains (dont try this at home). One deleted scene and bloopers round out the bonus features. DVD people should note that the bloopers are the only extra on the disc. There is no commentary.

Word is that Disney did not renew the project development contract with Bruckheimer because of The Lone Rangers poor showing in theaters. It is difficult to understand how the film was released in the shape its in. This is a huge company and Bruckheimers team is made up of experienced professionals. Surely a good editor could have streamlined the story and given Hammer some points on how to be a hero.

Meanwhile, we have a beautiful, high-def picture, showing gorgeous location shots and outstanding sets, with a truly magnificent DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack. If only there was a story to go with it.",1389830400,2,3356,4.713310580204778

5823757,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Depp, as Tonto, portrays a Native American stoicism wonderfully, with a sense of humor that is Spock-like.  What makes him so funny in this movie, as compared to a ""Pirates of the xxx,"" is the complete nonchalance that he shows no matter what is happening or what he's doing.  Must see to appreciate.

However, the word I kept thinking of when watching the Ranger himself was, ""pacifist.""  He actually became annoying after awhile, as if he thought he could just ""bring them to justice,"" no matter that he's in an active gunfight, or that the bad guy is not going to just surrender.  The cliche pronouncements about guns grew old as well...""you know I don't believe in those things,"" when offered a revolver.  Why is he a Ranger, then???

One star off for the Ranger's sensitivities, the other 4 belong to Depp/Tonto, and it's well worth the viewing just for his performance.",1389830400,,875,4.717105263157895

People all over, even white trash american christian right, are getting sick of movies that try to bombard us with lots of special effects and story line and dialog that are a joke. I guess the producers and directors will be laughing all the way to the bank. ""We made millions off the the rubes again"" I'm guessing they are saying. On the other hand, if you are a an american republican with school age children, there are lots and lots of: gun shots, rifle shots, cannon shots, gunpowder shots, explosions, no money going to public schools or education, sexual innuendo for 50+ year old white men  etc. etc. ----Z",1389744000,,735,4.6106870229007635

Everything was in place to come up with really good drama about the '50s crime fighting duo. Casting on this is horrendous. Depp can't be and Jack Sparrow and Tonto at the same time. Why the role reversal - no more ""That right, Kemo Sabe"" in this pseudo-comedic farce. John Reid is just Tonto's helper boy. Armie Hammer needs acting classes. They wasted the beautiful monument Valley landscape to make a dud. Filled with just in the nick of time action sequences and CGI that saves the heroes, and helped by the dumb wide-eyed kid in a museum to tell the story, this movie becomes sillier by the minute.

I didn't know anyone who had personally been to see this movie so I figured I would take a chance and go see it. After all I grew up on the Lone Ranger,it was the Sunday morning staple--granted I was horse crazy so that was the main draw,but I did have fond memories of the T.V. show. I like Johnny Depp he is one of my favorite actors,so I knew his performance would be a bit off center for most people. I thought his take on Tonto was spot on and just a off the wall enough for what Tonto had been through. The movie moved along at a fast pace, and it explained everything that was going on well. The cast did an awesome job and worked very well together. It was a fun and fast paced movie that from time to time left you wondering just a little bit. Well worth the money to see it in the theater and well worth the money to buy the DVD. On one hand bigger, better, and alot funnier that the original T.V. show on the other hand it made me stop and think about things in a different light. I bet they will do another one, or should I say I hope that they do another one. Take a chance on this movie and enjoy it for what it is and you won't be sorry.",1389744000,2,1263,3.9375

5823770,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I saw this movie in the theater and couldn't wait to get it on Blue Ray when it came out. The Lone Ranger was one of my favorite characters growing up. I don't really know why the film didn't do better in theaters. While not really historically accurate in the timeline of the American West, the film represents a good caricature of the West. There's cowboys and Indians, buffalo, the railroad being built by Chinese, and a Custer-like cavalry commander with lots of action to keep you entertained.

The film is probably a bit long to sit in a theater for hours, which is probably why it didn't do as good as anticipated. I do think it the length was necessary to develop all the characters. Also I think a smaller percentage of the viewing public is drawn to Westerns these days, but if you do like a good Western then this is a good one to watch.

The package comes with a Blu Ray disc as well as a code to redeem a digital copy which is easy to do. You just enter the code and pick a service like Amazon Instant Video or iTunes and can watch on any device you have that service on.",1389744000,2,1084,4.231884057971015

5823772,5,B00DJYJWVW,The Lone Ranger was very entertaining.  Johnny Depp did a fantastic job as Tonto.  The story line was great with lots of action and appropriately placed humor.  It was also very refreshing that there was no use of profanity or sexually explicit situations.  How refreshing!  This is the kind of movies that should be presented to audiences.

When he's not, it drags, a big problem for a movie way too long for its weak story. Even the titular lead Armand Hammer (John Reid) plays second banana to Depp's noble savage, who steals every scene he's in. The extravagant action sequences (with gorgeous CGI) are impressive, especially the train chase (Depp's stunts are a brilliant homage to Buster Keaton). The supporting cast is capable and plays all the currently fashionable Western stereotypes in suitably outrageous style, notably Tom Wilkinson (Latham Cole) who acts as if he's about to don a cape and twirl his mustache like Dastardly Whiplash then tie Ruth Wilson (Rebecca Reid) to the railroad tracks!

All of the characters were either very appealing or exceptionally villainous.  I found that it incorporated all of those things we loved about Pirates of the Caribbean but absolutely fresh and not a carbon copy. They also order time in an interesting twist, from an aging Tonto's tall tells to a tiny big eyed boy. It stayed true to the feel of the time periods and made me feel as if I were really witnessing this window into the past. The acting was very good, and Silver was really wonderful.

5823830,4,B00DJYJWVW,"As parents with a family tradition of a weekly movie night, we eventually see just about every Disney movie there is. I admit that even though I gifted my son this with blu-ray at Christmas, I wasn't really looking forward to watching, given the film's critical drubbing and having been burned by a ""how bad can it be?"" blas&eacute; about last year's big Disney disaster&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Carter/dp/B007MDB71O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Carter </a>, which proved to be a truly dismal viewing experience.

Because we'd been so turned off by Carter, and also hated Depp's last Western, the animated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rango/dp/B00AEFYX4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rango </a>, we only reluctantly finally indulged our son, who has been happily building his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LEGO-The-Lone-Ranger-Constitution-Train-Chase/dp/B00ATX7JS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LEGO The Lone Ranger Constitution Train Chase </a>&nbsp;and other sets from the series since Santa brought them last month, by watching this film. And, guess what? It didn't suck. Far from it, actually.

It probably helps that I have great childhood affection, passed on to me by my father, for the Lone Ranger black and white TV series, and I even saw the critically-panned&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-the-Lone-Ranger/dp/B001ARDC16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of the Lone Ranger</a>&nbsp;in the theater (apparently, we were the only ones), with my folks and a few friends, when I was just about my son's age and, though I can't say I had particularly refined artistic tastes at the time, remember loving it. And, as I recall, so did all my friends. We played Lone Ranger for weeks around the neighborhood and tried to make ourselves blood brothers/sisters with pocketknives. (Not the best lesson, but the most memorable part of that movie for me.) Therefore, my memories of the franchise's various incarnations are all good ones. (By the way, I also remember the various parents that took us complaining about how bad that 1981 movie was.)

The storyline here is pretty much what you'd expect from a Lone Ranger origin film. The train escape of Butch Cavendish, followed by the canyon ambush of the Rangers by Cavendish and his gang; Tonto rescuing John Reid after his brother and all the others are killed; the appearance of the wild white horse who becomes Silver; etc. Throw in a silver mine and some calvary vs Native American action and that's the gist of the plot.

Johnny Depp is treading well-worn territory here with Tonto only a slight variation on his Jack Sparrow character from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-of-the-Caribbean/dp/B0071JADFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates of the Caribbean </a>&nbsp;series, but my husband and I both laughed several times at his deadpan one-liners. Armie Hammer does a sturdy, if non-spectacular, job as the law abiding, straight-laced, always-ethical Lone Ranger. And frequent Depp co-star Helena Bonham-Carter makes a memorable one-legged prostitute. Good use was made of the classic William Tell Overture theme and the action sequences, particularly the train sequences that bookend the film, were very well done. (The final action sequence also seems to contain an overt nod to another Disney film:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-3/dp/B003XKPPOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story 3</a>)

The movie, in fact, looked fantastic. Great action, picturesque, scenic set pieces and a real, classic ""Old West"" feel. The dialogue was fairly snappy and was, at times, quite sharp and funny. There are plenty of call backs for Lone Ranger fans, including several jibes about the silly, made-up Native American sounding words that litter the Ranger canon, a relic from the far less enlightened 1930s origins of the characters. They also managed to include just about every classic Lone Ranger trope, but put a little bit of a twist on them to better suit modern sensibilities. Of course, they did miss, perhaps, the biggest one of all, neglecting to include: ""Who was that masked man?,"" which seems like a fairly large oversight. (It's totally possible that all the ""What's with the mask?"" lines were meant to mock it.)

I'd say the framing device of an elderly Tonto telling the story to a young boy dressed like the Ranger--which kept making me think of the opening of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Guns-2/dp/B004TK3XTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Guns 2</a>, another guilty-pleasure modern Western--set in 1933, the year the Ranger premiered on radio, didn't always work very well, but it wasn't awful enough to ruin the film.

All in all, while this is far from classic fare, we enjoyed it from beginning to end, which is a lot more than we can say about Carter. I'm not saying it was a great film, but it was far better than several other, far more critically acclaimed but ultimately awful and boring movies we've sat through recently: <cough>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-of-Steel/dp/B008JFUPK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man of Steel </a>&nbsp;<cough>.

This was entertaining and fun, suitable for most kids (there's some fairly gruesome violence, but it's more discussed rather than seen), but clever enough to also hold adults'  attention ...  Which is pretty much all I ask of in a family action film. I'm not sure what else to add other than that we enjoyed it FAR more than we expected, since we went in with extremely low expectations, and came away feeling like we had a really good time.",1389571200,3,5875,6.03357314148681

The action and cinematography was great. There were many great action sequences on the trains,  but I really didn't like that tongue in cheek humor that is also found in the IronMan, Sherlock Holmes, Transformers films, etc. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt.

I believe Johnny Depp's Tonto was beyond average. He took us on a journey, discovering the nuances of the character, answering the ""why's"" within the terms of his behavior and dress. The Lone Ranger (Armie Hammer) was the ""tonto"" of the film. His character seemed empty. I will not review the movie in depth, for many have gone into several paragraphs explaining the minutia.

Perhaps I came into this with less preconceptions than others... I am not a Depp fanboy.  I am not an avid original series watcher.  So didn't have that preoccupying me when watching.

The movie is long (2.5 hrs) and goes at swift and slow paces.  To me, the pace changes, and the plot feel correct.  The movie flip flows between drama to humor to slapstick to action to Indiana Jones type action.  Usually, I'm not a fan of the Indiana Jones type action (yes, I LOVED those movies but Hollywood has jumped the shark using it everywhere)... but all the difference types of scenes held together.

There is one thing I want to call out.  I feel Depp does a truly solid job of portraying a man with overwhelming sadness and a deep wound.  He doesn't do it as an in your face, you must feel bad for me manner... he does it by staying in character every moment, every scene... everything he does is believable to me.  Was impressed.

The action was great, I loved the cinematography (the wilderness shots were taken in Utah, so now it really makes me want to go on expedition out there), and Johnny Depp did really well as Tonto (the ""Hi yo Silver"" part was awesome).

5823852,3,B00DJYJWVW,"I had the right frame of mind going into this film after seeing (and loving) Dark Shadows. I also was one of the few who really liked The Green Hornet film.

The Lone Ranger tries to do a similar job poking fun and completely unraveling the classic characters, but it never reaches the same level of fun as the other two films I mentioned. Depp is the real reason to watch this film and his dead pan delivery is often hilarious. The action is beyond cartoony, but that isn't really where the film fails.

The biggest problem with this film is that it is too long at 2 1/2 hours?! I mean why? This isn't The Godfather folks, it's a goofy take on a beloved character. It has some very funny moments and I did enjoy it, just not as much as I had antisipated. There are some very good ideas here, it just isn't fleshed out enough to really be considered a great spoof.

The film has so little to do with The Lone Ranger, this film could more aptly been titled Tonto, Because there is so little resemblance to the classic masked hero. I give it 2 1/2 stars because I was able to sit through 2 1/2 hours of this time filling nonsense, mostly because Depp was very funny. I think my expectations were too high going in on this one.

They portray Tonto as some depressed Indian suffering from some past event, that has cause him to be hell bent on finding those responsible for his condition.

Instead this film goes in the opposite direction and offers up fare that is more akin to the camp fun of Adam West's Batman. It is a disappointment. The Lon Ranger does have some good moments and I enjoyed the work of Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer. However despite the obvious hard work the story and screenplay simply let them down. The actions sequences are a mess; at times gratuitously over the top and at others something of a yawn. The train sequence which represented the grand finale was straight out of the cartoons - I almost expected a guest appearance from Dick Dastardly or the Road Runner.

A remake of the Lone Ranger needs a good deal more imagination than went into this film; We live in dark times where corporate corruption, bought politicians and expedience are ascendant - what better time than now to re-invent the Lone Ranger? Sadly this film is a waste of a golden opportunity. The Lone Ranger should've been re-imagined to the current day; instead we got a camp, awkward and at times discordant slapstick version of the original.

However I'm giving the film 3 stars simply because it is watchable, light entertainment. The actors try hard are there are a few moments that truly do work brilliantly. Unfortunately there just aren't enough of them to redeem this film.",1389398400,2,1414,4.69758064516129

I was surprised by how they chose to characterize the relationship between Tonto and TLR, because throughout the episode (though TLR can sometimes be patronizing), there is a mutual respect for each other.

5823890,1,B00DJYJWVW,"First let me begin by saying it is NOT (contrary to popular belief) that modern audiences don't like Westerns or cannot appreciate The Lone Ranger.  It's just that this is a really, really bad movie.

 Tonto is insane. He is a caricature here that deeply disrespects Native Americans.  He was driven insane and now he ""trades"" taking valuable things and swapping them for garbage when the owner is not looking.  He keeps his dead pet bird mounted on his head and periodically tries to feed it.  That's not funny.  It's just sad.  He's not likable.  He's mean and it's disrespectful to the original Lone Ranger story.  Tonto was useful, intelligent, and ...even kind in the original Lone Ranger. This Tonto is heartless.

Also the ""new"" meaning for Ke-mo sah-bee is just cruel.  ""Wrong brother"" is constantly telling him ""Your brother should have lived and not you"" even after they become friends.  That's not funny.  That's mean spirited.

Tonto's behavior through the whole thing, insane or not, did not sit right for me.  He bashed the hero's head with a shovel when he started to wake up after the deaths of the rangers and had no qualms about burying a man a live.  And then after a horse (yes, a horse) persuades him to help the lone ranger he drags the man's body, deliberately through horse droppings.  (Ha freakin' ha.)  And the joke is addressed later when the hero smells his own stinky hair.

Tonto calls the villain a Windigo which isn't even from the Right native American tribal folk belief.  Windigo is of the North East folk belief, the complete opposite side of the continent!  Skin walker would have been more acceptable.  Someone mixed up Skin walker (yee naaldlooshii) and didn't think anyone would notice.  Whatever happened to the promise that this version would be more respectful of Native American culture?

Helena Bonham Carter shows up as a madam with an artificial leg that is actually a gun.  Did I mention the villain likes to mutilate people and or eat human body parts?  Because... You totally need that in a Disney film.

It's like watching Tim Burton's spouses run a muck.

There's a ridiculous scene where a boy throws The Lone Ranger a silver bullet from the speeding train and he catches it, one handed, while on horse back.  And they never properly explain that those silver bullets are used to represent how valuable life is and The Lone Ranger's promise not to kill but only wound and only in self-defense from the original stories.  He also never drank or smoked either.  Oh, yes, and he also ends up the love interest of his dead brother's widow here, only days after his brother's death...

So you see, those that think The Lone Ranger failed because people don't like Westerns anymore have it wrong.  It's not that we can't like Westerns.  It's just that this is a bad, bad movie.  Watch the old black and white ones, they're free on Hulu and surprisingly more respectful to Native Americans...",1389312000,4,2938,4.725838264299803

If you like Johnny Depp, you'll love this flick.  His facial expressions are classic Depp, and make for some hilarious moments.  Armey Hammer does a great job as the Ranger, and makes the character likable.

The campy style really develops towards the end, and the tip-of-the-hat to the classic series is tastefully done and made both my wife (not a western fan) and I smile.  While the romance doesn't 'resolve', I think they were leaving an opening for a sequel, and thus it is excusable.

Although it wasn't the very best movie I have ever watched, it was far from being a bad movie.  In fact, I'm still trying to figure out why it got such bad reviews.  Without summarizing the storyline and rehashing the movie, I will say that it had some very tender character relationships, loyalty, wild west action, sadness, comedy, and I would absolutely would love to see a sequel.

I was very surprised and wished I had seen it on the big screen. Lots of action and a good funny story. Johnny Depp's Tonto, is not Jack Sparrow as some critics had claimed.

5823922,1,B00DJYJWVW,"I am a big Johnny Depp fan, but not even that could save this movie for me.  I should have known before ordering this movie that it was going to be terrible just from the fact that Tonto (Johnny Depp) has a dead crow on his head.  I don't care how clever the writer thinks the reason is for it, it is still just a dead crow - on his head - for the entire movie - a dead crow!  Jay Silverheels (The original Tonto) must be turning over in his grave.
From beginning to end this movie was boring, predictable, at times sadistically brutal, slow, and blatantly not funny. This movie could have possibly appealed to children, but due to some of the incredibly brutal and violent things that occur, I would not recommend children of age 13 or less watch this which sadly is probably the only audience that might have found this painfully bad movie entertaining.
What would have been a better style to make this movie, without the crow, would be in the image of a ""Batman Begins"" method.

It looks at the beginning of the Lone Ranger story where the character goes reluctantly kicking and screaming into his new persona.

HAmmer was too effeminate a performance to make us believe the incredible fight scenes that followed especially the over-the-top climactic chase scene--way too much! Fichtner's and Wilkinson's villians were also too much to take--did Wilkinson have to shoot the entire board of directors? No wonder this movie flopped.",1389225600,,649,5.240384615384615

You cannot expect the movie to be anything like the original Lone Ranger t.v. show...if you're expecting that you'll be disappointed.

The love story was weak (not that it matters to me) but they tried to tie it into the plot halfheartedly. The boy clearly would have been psychologically affected, still found time to smile during a sequence that in real life would have made a grown man poop his pants. The bad guys could have gone out in a more fitting way... Like I said, good build up, just a let down at the end.",1389139200,2,544,4.240384615384615

5823975,4,B00DJYJWVW,"One of the joys of the late-stage Depp performances is his growing subtlety as an actor.

This film is slow and over-long but the real gem is the work Johnny Depp does in the delivery of his portrait of the character Tonto.
It may be a consequence of having grown up watching the TV series and the insights and prejudices that this entails but Depp adds tremendous humor, wisdom and zaniness to the role in a way only he can.

I found it well worth the price of admission to enjoy Depp's performance.",1389139200,2,500,4.365591397849462

5823977,5,B00DJYJWVW,I loved this movie.  It is a shame that the critics were so far off.  Some of the scenes they were the most critical of I thought were some of the best scenes....so there you have it!!  I am sure that a whole lot of folks did not see this movie because of their terrible reviews!  Hopefully now people will watch and judge for themselves!!!!!!!  I thought that Depp's portrayal of Tonto as much more than a sidekick and gopher for The Lone Ranger was refreshing and long overdue.  There was just the right amount of those familiar Johnny Depp one liners and looks to add a bit of humor.  The action scenes on the trains at the end were amazing.  I love that someone was willing to invest in making a high budget western again.,1389139200,3,726,4.286764705882353
5823978,5,B00DJYJWVW,This version of The Lone Ranger is an irreverent romp of a movie.  It takes the myth and does a new take on the relationship and the times building a farce that pokes fun at all of the old tales.  I enjoyed it.,1389139200,2,210,3.86046511627907
5823979,2,B00DJYJWVW,I was highly dissapointed they decided to turn the Lone Ranger into an Ivy League wussy who bumbles his way through the movie by luck. Can't have a real macho white male figure any more. Diminished the respect and integrity of the original relationship between Tanto and the Lone Ranger. More $$$ wasted by Hollywood to blast an American hero and ruin the character's historical legacy.,1389139200,,386,4.863636363636363

Where to begin? The obvious answer is Johnny Depp. Depp has been playing the same  character for, ummm, about his last 5 or 6 films. Wacky make-up, mumbling attempts at foreign accents, irritatingly quirky mannerisms, to the extreme, which I'm sure all his adoring fans, and apparently Gore Verbinsky, find s-o-o-o hilarious. More the cinematic equivalent of fingernails on a chalkboard. This movie gets so sidetracked with Depp's obvious ""You know what would be funny? How about if Tonto..."" and more time is wasted with more ""improv"" from the ""real star"" of this stinker. Armie Hammer...who?...barely registers on screen. And when he is on screen, he's irritating and seemingly way over his head as the second banana to Depp's silly blathering. And that hat! That awful hat! It looks like the wardrobe designer got it at a party supply store. (How does everyone's hat stay on while fighting on top of a runaway train?) ""Six-shooters"" that never run out of bullets, anachronisms in speech patterns, boiler-plate villains that seem to bounce back from repeated beatings/ shootings/ and more beatings without a scratch. The list goes on, just like this movie, seemingly forever. If you need to re-set your standard for a ""BAD"" movie, this is the one to watch.",1389052800,8,1430,5.059322033898305

The ""white man vs Indian"" issue was politicized to the point of painting all white men, including the Lone Ranger, in a bad light.  The Lone Ranger himself was not the studly cowboy hero he was promoted to be in the trailers.  He was a wimp of a man who doesn't really step up until the last 20 minutes of the movie.  The final big blow out scene with the good guys and bad guys on two colliding trains is over the top and hard to follow.  There are a couple of random things that just seemed hoaky and out of place ...the horse's ability to show up in random places (a tree limb...really?) and the two scenes with what appear to be vampire rabbits (where did that come from??).  Finally, the fact that it was a flashback being told by a really old Tonto just felt strange and didn't add anything to the story.  So sad!  This could have been a great movie.

5824051,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I saw this in the theater.  Was it what I was expecting, no, but I did enjoy it!
It is meant to be a fun romp of the old west, with some twist and turns.  Disney didn't make this movie to be the next ""On the Waterfront"".
I found it entertaining from start to finish, with some good laughs along the way.  Of coarse, to me that is what a movie is, a trip or a journey of someone telling a story.  I don't claim to be a film critic, nor would I want to be, since most of them are just actors that could never hack it in movies, can someone say ""jaded"".  It comes back to that old saying, ""Those that can't do teach"".  I really almost didn't go see this movie because of the reviews critics gave it, it was the last day it was in the theater near me, so I thought what the heck and went.  I have to say, I was glad I saw this on the big screen, it is action packed and glad I didn't listen to the so called film critics.  I would actually like to someday know the requirements to get a job as a film critic, I guess you have to be someone that complains a lot!
So all in all, I would say yes, this is a really good movie.  It told a fun story and brought a different approach at telling it.  I think this will be like all creative movies, like Caddy Shack and National Lampoon's Vacation, when they come out, critics tore them apart mainly because they themselves didn't understand it.  I really think the so called ""Film Critics"" are to blame for this film being a flop at the box office.  The friend I saw this movie with said the same thing, when the movie was over, he didn't understand why they gave it such a bad review, that it was a really good movie.  He was reluctant to go see it because of the reviews he had heard too, but was glad I drug him out to go see it.
So yes I would recommend this to a friend and probably anyone who like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Batman and other movies along that vein.  It is meant to be fantasy, not real life.",1388966400,3,1955,3.94147582697201

5824058,1,B00DJYJWVW,"In all honesty, I know very little about ""The Lone Ranger."" He wears a mask, he lives in the Old West, and he has a buddy who keeps calling him ""kemosabe,"" whatever that means.

So I had few expectations of ""The Lone Ranger,"" which Disney attempted to set up as the natural successor to ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" -- director Gore Verbinski, Johnny Depp being goofy, lots of over-the-top action. Instead, it ends up a colossal flop that frantically tries to appeal to everyone, but ends up appealing to no one.

Lawyer John Reid (Arnie Hammer) returns to the town of Colby, determined to bring law and order to the lawless West. But then his brother is murdered (and partially eaten) by the notorious outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner), and John is left for dead. Fortunately, he's found by Tonto (Johnny Depp), a Comanche who believes Cavendish is a wendigo (despite that not being a Comanche belief, to the best of my knowledge).

But with the guidance of a spirit horse (don't ask), Tonto brings John back to life to battle Cavendish, and the two men join forces, despite John being kind of a weenie. And when John finally takes up the mantle of the Lone Ranger, he and Tonto soon discover that Cavendish's scheme has national implications... and yes, they are glaringly obvious.

There is one damning problem with ""The Lone Ranger"" that sinks it as a film: it can't figure what it wants to be. It wants to be a gritty, dusty slow-moving drama, but also a buddy comedy. A realistic depiction of the Old West, but also full of goofy over-the-top action. It wants to include the plight of the Indian populace in the 1800s, but it also wants Tonto to wear a birdcage on his head.

There is literally no scene in this movie that doesn't give you mood whiplash of one kind or another. Example: a scene where John sees his brother eaten alive... is followed by Tonto having an argument with a horse. It's also littered with all sorts of bizarre things that are never explained, including an infestation of vampire rabbits or a steampunk madam with a gun in her ivory leg.

But the story is a bloated mess even without those oddities. Large portions of the movie seem like they were inserted to pad out the running time (the frame device, the brothel visit) because they don't add anything to the plot. And there are plot holes you could drive a space shuttle through, such as HOW Tonto escaped from the jail cell. Even worse, the narrative actually brings up that plot hole... and never answers it. It's the laziest writing outside of a literal deus ex machina.

It feels like Gore Verbinski knew there was something wrong with ""The Lone Ranger,"" but not WHAT. So he simply flung more action and quirkiness at the story until it becomes an incoherent mess.

I will say that most of the actors do a passable job, even though the material is betraying them. Arnie Hammer tries his hardest with the masked vigilante, even though John comes across as a naive twit. Ruth Wilson -- whom I've observed since ""Jane Eyre"" -- gives a performance far too passionate and deep for the cliched ""old flame"" role she's playing.

As for Johnny Depp as Tonto... really, I don't even know what to think. This character is the embodiment of everything wrong with the movie. There are a few moments where Depp gets to shine, showing the long hard road Tonto has been on, the horrors he's seen, and the guilt he feels...

... but more frequently, we get to see Tonto acting like an idiot, doing loopy things purely for the comic relief. It honestly becomes hard to tell if Tonto is being portrayed in a racist manner, or if the Disney executives stupidly decided that they could do the exact same thing that they did with Jack Sparrow. Either way, it cheapens the character and his backstory to have him being an out-of-touch loon.

""The Lone Ranger"" has a few bright spots, but the overall effect is of a messy, bipolar movie that careens around like an out-of-control roller-coaster. It's got a lot of action eye-candy, but the substance is a melted mess.",1388966400,10,4039,4.611420612813371

Did it really bother you  the ""Engineering Section"" of the star ship Enterprise was actually a thinly-veiled brewery as shown in the re-booted Star Trek movies?  No! Why? We were to caught up in the action.

I challenge you to watch some of the early classic John Wayne westerns, like John Ford's Stagecoach (1939). The characters were bigger-than-life, as was the music, as were the scenery and photography in the desolate Monument Valley.

This movie was a classic action-adventure telling a tale as old as Greek mythology. Two strangers from two different worlds are, unknowingly, on the same quest -- the need for redemption. For John Reid, it was bringing his brother's killer to justice (not a revenge-killing); for Tonto, to come to terms with the guilt of an inadvertent unintended act as young boy that, in his mind, caused the deaths of his family and tribe. John Reid was believed to have been killed and Tonto was cast out from his Comanche culture to wander alone; neither could return to his own world.

The film could have over-burdened itself with the dark and serious undertones, especially regarding the treatment of Native Americans and imported Chinese slave labor (to build he railroads); proper homage was paid to both groups without getting mired down in an embarrassing and sappy politically-correct guilt trip. The comic relief offered a respite from the darkness but was a bit overdone at times. Once again, there was so much action, you really didn't care.

I think the film suffered at the box office due largely to critics jumping on it from the outset. Apparently, some were upset because the film did not stick to the strict canon of the old TV/radio series; others thought it was Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-in-the-old-West. Both complaints were totally unjustified in my opinion.  Had this film been produced by someone other than Disney/Bruckheimer or starred someone other than Depp as Tonto, critics would have raved. I saw no evidence of Jack Sparrow in Depp's portrayal of Tonto though Hammer's portrayal of the Ranger seemed strained at times. Hammer was OK but just lacked the screen presence of a John Wayne or a younger Harrison Ford. The fifty-cent word they use these days is that Hammer lacked the ""gravitas"" for this kind of role.  Never the less, he held his own throughout the film even though he may have been just miscast.

I gave it five stars for the story, special effects, stunt work and an engaging story.  They spared no expense (and perhaps too much) when it came to filming at locations in six different western states. This was a quality production that moved through it's story in a well-paced manner without feeling incomplete or too rushed. There were things that I didn't care for all that much but most were rather trivial or simply matters of personal taste.",1388880000,7,3247,4.8499095840868
5824081,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I did not want to like this movie... My sister got me to rent it while visiting and I thought I'd use it to blackmail her into seeing American Hustle, but it was surprisingly good.
Parts of the plot felt forced, and ultimately they shoved in Helena Bonham Carter, as is standard in all Johnny Depp movies, but for the most part the movie carried itself pretty well.
The movie is about THE LONE RANGER, guy in white hat, whose brother is a famous lawman. Criminal being transferred to face justice bla blah blah, escapes, bang bang crash, 'Lets Go Getim!'. Ultimately leading to the creation of The Lone Ranger, who wears a mask to protect those he cares about. The story has been done before, they didn't screw it up, but there weren't any vast improvements to it. Tonto's story however was very surprising. By now we're used to seeing Johnny Depp play eccentric loners, but in this movie brought that front and center before the end and definitely made it apart of the story rather than just an acting technique.
Ultimately what made me a fan was the final action sequence starting with that iconic music and ending with the final quip about the horse. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family and hope you all see it too.",1388880000,2,1238,4.556053811659193

The Lone Ranger on TV was a stoic, reliable hero. In this movie, he is a bumbling idiot. It's a shame that the writers thought a male stereotype (either a jerk or an idiot) was necessary for the audience to feel sympathetic with the hero.

Tanto (Johnny Depp) was, of course, awesome. Yet, the best thing that could happen to the Lone Ranger would be a hard, gritty remake. Something along the lines of the recent trilogy of Batman movies. How about a real western film with the Lone Ranger?",1388880000,2,644,4.551724137931035

Johnny Depp was sensational, especially his facial expressions.  The special effects were outstanding and rarely over the top like in movies like Man of Steel.  I watched it again with my family over Christmas.  It was good but not great, at least not as great as in the theaters.  However, on balance it is very good.  The last 45 minutes of action, starting with the William Tell Overture is the best part of the movie.

With a little bit of work one way or the other, it could have been either a real comedy or an interesting take on the Lone Ranger story. It could have really worked as a serious remake of the Lone Ranger, shame they could not decide on what they wanted. Some say this is a deep movie regarding Native Americans, sorry I see it more as an insult. If they really wanted to make it ""deep"" then why make parts of it an idiotic comedy? Why make Tonto to be mentally ill (dead crow on his head?)?

I won't say why so as not to ruin any of the story for you, but trust me.  You will regret ignoring this warning - and spend a lot fo time trying (unsuccessfully) to explain or remove certain images from a young mind.

I wanted to turn it off without finishing it , but everyone insisted we continue to watch it due to the amount of time invested. I cant believe that no one in the cast said ""wait a second, we are filming this, why don't we just not end it instead."" I have only written one review on Amazon in the past for a great product, this more than equals that, because we had a competition to decide who has seen a worse movie and in the end we all lost(in more ways than one). I think it was entitled the lone ranger, because the only person left in the room watching it was a lone man who is a true hero. I now have the movie equivalent to post traumatic stress, and if your contemplating watching this, save your time and just buy Christmas Vacation 2, Eddie's Island Retreat, because at least the title reminds you of something funny.

Yes the producers and directors delivered a spoof of many westerns but particularly the Lone Ranger while telling their own story and perhaps getting out a message as well. For the Native peoples, the too few tribes left of the many that once roamed this continent, the message is profound. ""We are already ghosts"" says a Comanche chieftain, too many white, not enough red to stem the tide.  There was a lot of greed involved in much of the takeover by white European settlers, granted not all but enough to make many of us still cringe today. And in the end, the Native can never go home again. Like the old Tonto of the movie, he is left a red man in a white man's clothes forever traveling lands that will never be home.",1388793600,2,1080,4.510204081632653

5824143,4,B00DJYJWVW,"This is a fun western, it's the kind of role that Johnny Depp excels at playing and his portrayal of Tonto is quite amusing. Don't get me wrong, this is far from a great film, but it is a very entertaining one. It's very slap stick in nature which does sit at odds on some of the more serious parts of the film.

It would be wrong to think of this as a comedy, it has its funny parts, but it's more of a western with some humour in it than a straight action comedy.

The story is fairly basic, a brother returns when a notorious outlaw escapes custody and joins the manhunt to recapture the criminal. The posse are ambushed and all but the brother are killed, he is rescued by Tonto and a rather amazing horse (who has some fun moments in the film) and becomes the lone ranger as part of his quest for justice.

The film is well shot and while it's reasonably long it doesn't feel drawn out. Special mention should be made for the finale which is one of the silliest and impressive I've seen in a while. There's a lot of fun here, just don't expect anything too serious.",1388793600,2,1070,4.184466019417476

5824148,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I grew up listening to the Lone Ranger sitting on my grandfather's knee, in front of one of those old old ""standing on the floor"" radios. We loved the show (it started in 1933, but I am not that old), and spending our time together. According to WIKI I think there were three different actors who played the Lone Ranger title character.

When the Lone Ranger TV series came along on the black and while screen, I was old enough to sit in the chair next to my grandfather and we watched the series. I don't believe we ever missed one.

I love Johnny Depp. Not everything he does, but the Lone Ranger is definitely one of them. A recent public radio show covering the movies in 2013 talked about the collision of a number or movies being released at the same time. One of the movies getting poor reviews was the Lone Ranger. I can only praise the movie, for us it was great!

Some Amazon reviewers have taken issue with the fact that this movie was not true to the TV series. Well, we have to respect their opinions and what their expectations and preferences are. For myself, I remember going to a large stadium and watching the ""new"" Lone Ranger ride around the ring and my immediate reaction is ""THAT IS NOT THE LONE RANGER"".

Of all of the lone rangers Clayton Moore, on the TV series will always be the 1st and only image of the character I will see and no one will measure up to him.  That of course is just my opinion.

There will never be another character playing Tonto that will ever match John Todd from the TV series, again in my opinion. It is worth mentioning that according to Wiki Tonto means ""foolish"" or ""silly"" in Spanish.

Now given that insight let me work backwards. I am biased, I like Johnny Depp. When I hear he is starring in a movie, I expect Johnny Depp, I know he will play different characters, but all else aside I want to see and experience Johnny Depp the actor. When I see the previews, I get what I assume to be a snapshot of the movie. I expect to see how the characters are playing their roles. With the Lone Ranger, Johnny Depp's face paint, the one liners etc. all clearly set my expectations that this would not be (thankfully) a remake of the TV series. That would be unacceptable to me.

We were not able to catch the movie at the theater and looked for elsewhere without success. Then we found the DVD was being released but weeks away. We went to Comcast, no Lone Ranger and then by chance I powered up my Kindle. Within minutes we had the Kindle plugged into our TV and were into the world of Johnny Depp as Tonto and the Lone Ranger. There were no disappointments and quite a few surprises. Using the museum and the young boy to start the movie and continue the narration was creative genius and for us clearly planted this movie to stand on it's own. It is not another movie, it is not a remake of the TV series, it is a movie starring Johnny Depp. If there is a sequel, we will be sure to see it as well.

There will NEVER be any radio show to replace the one my grandfather and I listened to on the old tube radio. There will NEVER be a Lone Ranger like Clayton Moore. No one can ever play the TV Tonto that will be better than John Todd. There will never be another Johnny Depp. I am very thankful for each of these, and since they are my biases, I can only share them with you, in the hope that your expectations and experiences are aligned if you are going to see this movie. I am ordering the DVD from Amazon.

All that being said, this is more of Johnny Depp as in Pirates of the Caribbean and I believe was made by the same people.",1388793600,3,3584,4.218978102189781

The story could have been written much better and the characters played a little differently.

This is an origin story of The Lone Ranger, and his trusted companion Tonto. It's not terribly original however. But I believe most people will enjoy it nonetheless. I highly recommend it as a family movie.

I honestly thought this was an awesome, silly epic. It has it's flaws, sure, but it's clear that the movie wants to entertain you with it's over the top antics. It's supposed to be a 'fun' movie, not a somber drama. Critics need to relax and realize that some movies, like this one, are meant to be just simply that: fun.",1388620800,2,726,4.377777777777778

It has no basis in reality because people's thought processes back then were so different than how we comfortable humanoids live today...there is no equation. Stupid humor drives me nuts.

Today the show is preachy and hard to watch.  I also remember the last time the Lone Ranger was made into a film and I still shudder from that bad experience.

So along comes Johnny Depp with a dead crow on his head?

Is this film fine art...no.  Does this at times seem like another entry into the Pirates frachise?  Of course!

The brutal truth is I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. The final chase scene would have done Indiana Jones proud and leaves you singing rousing renditions of the ""William Tell Overture"" for days to come. I'm not sure what movie the critics were watching, but I love this movie.  Johnny Depp is hilarious in a deadpan, Buster Keaton way.  Hammer is no slouch either as the naive, idealistic greenhorn from the city.  Most of the move is about the greenhorn trying to deal with a half-mad Comanche and a half-sane spirt horse. By the end of the film, it becomes obvious that the Comanche is wise and the sprit horse knows what he is doing.

I hope that in spite of the bad reviews and poor box office performance, that there will be another one.  I want to see out the greenhorn makes out, now that he has accepted his role as sprit walker.

It wants to be a fun action romp in a western setting, but it also wants to be a drama that comments on the history between white men and Native Americans (especially by recreating tragedies that could've actually happened).

The Lone Ranger could've simply used a few edits. They should've cut most of the tragedy out (except for Tonto's back story), removed some of the unnecessary characters, and wholly focused on making it a fun western movie.

It just doesn't know what it wants to be and for that reason it gets a 3 out of 5. But if they were to take out the more serious elements, which are fine on their own but out of place in a fun, summer action movie, and just focused on making it pure entertainment and more in line with what most people perceive The Lone Ranger to be, it would've easily given it a 4 out of 5.

5824268,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I loved this movie and can't imagine why it got such a poor response from movie-goers.  It was more like a true Western than I've seen in years.  Loved the actors in this movie and the acting.  The story line was creative.  Some of the action was maybe over the top a bit, but that's Hollywood and Action films these days.  And Tonto's quirky character is a much needed comic relief, as the movie is very harsh and reality based in terms of how difficult and dangerous life really was back in the early years before it became civilized.  And you also get a real feel for just how crooked politicians and wealth can drive a man to do things that are unjust and immoral, just as they always have and as we continue to see in real life today.  So it's not a light-hearted movie like I was expecting, but much more of a realistic movie, that I ultimately just loved.",1388620800,2,862,4.283950617283951

5824270,1,B00DJYJWVW,"While some may like this movie, (although I have no idea why), it seemed to be lost in ""committee."" I never could figure out what his movie was supposed to be; A Comedy, Western, Action Adventure, Serious period Drama, Horror film, all of the above? I still don't know and apparently I am not alone. Those of us old enough to remember ""the real"" Lone Ranger and Tonto had to hate this film.

Those who aren't old enough, had to be confused about the premise of the film. Why was the movie called the ""Lone Ranger"" when ""Tonto"" apparently was the lead in the movie, with a dead bird on his head that he kept feeding? Why was the ""Lone Ranger"" such a clutch? And to top it off, the smartest one in the film was the Lone Rangers Horse ""Silver"" who seemed to have supernatural powers and the ability to fly. He was always somewhere you don't expect a horse to be. You know like on top of a moving train.

Apparently the committee that made this movie must have seen The Green Hornet and thought that was a good idea, even though it bombed as well. The only reason the bomb wasn't bigger was because the budget was smaller. In fact the only movie in recent memory that was worse than The Lone Ranger, was that horrible Green Hornet franchise killer as well. Ironically both created by the same writer, who actually had the two related; John Reed as the Ranger and Britt Reed as the Hornet. Man they must have really hated that guy to kill off two of the best characters he ever created. This movie really set ""sidekicks"" back.

This film recently made #1 in a top ten list of the worse bombs of 2013, losing over 200 million as word of mouth kept people away in droves. My girlfriend is still pissed at me because she didn't want to see it, and I convinced her it would be good. It will be years before I get my rep back in picking movies.

Bottom line: The acting is stiff. The story is a mis-mash of history, and a woman with a false leg with a gun built into it. The Ranger is a dumb lawyer whose brother has his heart eaten by the principle bad guy, Tonto is no Jack Sparrow, while there is a graphic bloody slaughter of Indians right in the middle of the film for reasons unknown. (Yeah I said Indians). But after the ""bad cowboy"" cuts the heart out of the ""good"" cowboy and eats it for reasons unknown, I guess all bets are off.

Save your money. Don't buy it, don't rent it. Trust me. Hey! How do you give a ""NO STAR"" rating anyway?",1388534400,6,2434,4.225806451612903

What it turns out to be is a really strange mash up of boring exposition, sprinkled in with very violent scenes (not family friendly), some goofball comedy (which we expected), and then part supernatural. Honestly, the biggest problem with this movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be - edgy commentary on murdering native Americans for the sake of progress, slapstick western, or vengeance story with a supernatural edge. The end result is just a very flat movie that lacks the fun, drama or suspense of Depp's other works.

The Ranger's unwillingness to take a life could have been a springboard to clever escapes and outwitting enemies, instead it just becomes immensely annoying. Johnny Depp is marvelous as Tonto. Armie Hammer sux. Depp is the only reason I gave this a 3, and it's barely there, 2.5 is closer to what it deserves.

So I was half afraid to watch it. I knew from the first couple of scenes with Tonto, I was in for a good time. It was Johnny Depp playing the crazy character he always seems to play. Helena Bonham Carter plays an equally strange character. It made for a lot of fun in this movie. I must say, this is the first Johnny Depp movie I wanted to watch again right after I saw it.

The other guy wears his costume well, which is all the role demands.  Everyone else is made of cardboard, but that's OK.  The action is frantic, about what the trailers would suggest.

I rarely go to the theatre. Usually wait and bring it home.  I thought this a very highly entertaining picture with characters true to heart.

Maybe you have to be my age to truly appreciate all the complications of the characters. I truly think this movie is brilliant and impeccably executed.

By the 90 minute mark, I had my answer. Folks, don't buy this clunker. Its not because Depp or Armie or the rest of the fine cast didn't deliver, its because the story is utterly ridiculous. The plot(s) is trying to be so many things other than entertaining right here, right now, that it leaves you wondering if the director and writer think nothing of your intelligence. I get it, they wanted a franchise out of this pig, but this film has so many problems I never want to hear of the Lone Ranger or Tonto ever again for the rest of my life. Yes, I grew up watching the TV show and loved those guys but this effort has soured me to the point that I don't care about them any longer. Sadly, every character in the film is a GD idiot and you end up hating them. By the time the Lone Rangers theme starts blaring you will be wishing that he and Silver get hit by the train so the lunacy will end. Thats right folks you get 2 hours and 25 minutes of setup for 5 whole minutes of heroism. I also hated the format of the movie which kept flashing to an Old West sideshow tent where an older Tonto is telling a kid about the Lone Ranger but we never learn why hes there or then why he leaves the showformulaic claptrap, I say, which made me think the writer had seen the Princess Bride one too many times. Further, they showed the duo robbing a bank in the beginning of the flick without coming back to it. It made no sense. In fact, none of it made any sense unless you realize the whole point of this dud was to get you to shell out more money for the sequel. Trust me: neither the special effects nor the cast will compel you to pay to see more of the same. Let this premise die and limit the damage to your fondness for Tonto and the Lone Ranger by skipping this film.",1388448000,5,1932,4.113756613756614

Johnny Depp is always good though this was not his best role. No fault against his performance, just not my favorite role of his. I will say that I disagree with the accusations that this was Captain Jack Sparrow as an Indian. Yes Tonto is not right in the head, but I felt that Johnny Depp's performance was distinct enough. He did not use the mannerisms of Jack, the only similarity was that both characters were considered ""strange."" The Lone Ranger himself was what failed to power the movie. I just didn't like character. Maybe the original Lone Ranger was a letter-of-the-law-I-don't-kill-bad-guys and a wuss on top of it, I don't know I never watched the old show, but I just can't call a movie good if I had no strong affection for any of the characters.",1388448000,2,936,4.385057471264368

It is very different than the previous versions of the Ranger and the comics. This is a good popcorn movie.
The reason this movie bombed at the box office was the fact that they used real trains in the movie as opposed to revamping new trains to look old or using CGI. They built real replica trains. I read this added about 100 million to the movie, give or take a few. The movie is long but doesn't feel long, which to me is a sign of a good story.

5824379,2,B00DJYJWVW,"A Blind Wink / Infinitum Nihil Production?!

That's how the making-of feature credits read. Nobody in this whacked production seemed
serious. The Blind Wink is deprecatory, a obvious insult. But the worst word was Nihil.

  The dictionary definition of nihilism, to quote: '""The rejection of all religious
  and moral principles, often in the belief that life is meaningless"".

  ""(In) Philosophy: 'extreme skepticism maintaining
  that nothing is the world has a real existence"".

  ""Historical: The doctrine of an extreme Russian revolutionary party circa
  1900, which found nothing to approve of in the established social order.""

I get a sense that a number of the cast/production/writing names are what Hollywood calls 'Dark Horse' names; names to be used by actors and crew when they don't want to be connected, their reputations associated with a flop. By ducking as they have I see them a so disillusioned and cynical they turned mean and bailed, maybe before they left. Before the right-on unhyped really bad reviews hit. No wonder it turned out so awful.

Only one name on that production credits I applaud: BOJAN BAZELLI.
5-Stars to him. He was the director of photography

These participants, from the Disney Board to the creative folk, caused Disney including
its investors a $200,000.000 loss, perhaps damaging Walt's reputation even more.

No doubt creatives were at odds with Disney; I can imagine how it went when business marketeers clashed with creatives; especially eccentrics like Johnny Depp. Scary. Wasteful. Methinks This Lone Ranger movie came from such wars. Not much fit, made sense, stayed true to the Lone Ranger concept.

In fact I knew and worked with a man at Procter & Gamble who became Disney's Board Chairman. When I knew him as a just-hired MBA grad - 3000 men interviewed; only three hired.  Eventually the go-getter got to be Disney President, then Chairman of  Disney's Board. The third guy I never met.

And me, I left P&G and went to a national ad agency (yes, I was a Mad Man in the 60's), agencies after agencies (six or seven in 15 years) I was a gypsy. Had so much fun. Far more than presidents had/have. Never stopped to think. Wonderful. Johnny Depp beats me though; I admire his life and achievements. Maybe we have the same formulae, Only he got rich.

Johnny Depp has a great life. All on his own terms, I expect and applaud. I wonder if he got burned in this fiasco. Heard he has a contract with Disney. Maybe there'll be a movie about it? Maybe he could play the Disney Chairman of the Board . . .

Last note: I really object to the portrayal of the Lone Ranger in this generally awful film. Clayton Moore's Lone Ranger was an icon, noble, intelligent and he shot guns out of bad guys hand so's he could be take them to trial; not because he missed when he was aiming for a kill shot, as in this flick. I knew Mr. Moore. In fact my mother dated him. Her only mistake was she introduced him to her roommate Sally, whom he married. Ain't life interesting? If you  let it be.

Whew, this's a long review. Final last note: Read the reviews for the Long Ranger TV series of yore at Amazon, many choices, prices.. With the real Ranger, Clayton Moore. He really believed in the virtues his character represented. He loved being the Lone Ranger.

There are new DVD sets out on the REAL Long Ranger. I just ordered about

Depp does a great job at adding character (and a bit of spice) to Tonto.  The base story takes a bit of time to work through; however, at about 2:04, the theme we all know and love begins turn in the story.  I get the impression there will be a sequel as this barely touches on the base story of who the character is and how the Ranger came to be.

Before renting the movie, I did read through some of the reviews -- for the most part, everyone enjoys this film.  There are some reviews that say things like ""predictable"" and so forth, to which I shake my head.  Really?  I found the movie full of surprises, none of which felt contrived.

Overall, great film.  It needs a sequel to begin building on the story they've developed.  I hope that happens in the near future.",1388361600,2,891,4.21301775147929
5824392,4,B00DJYJWVW,"My husband and I were reluctant to rent this movie after all the poor reviews but figured we would give it a chance since we are Johnny Depp fans. To our surprise, it was much better than we expected. You have to be familiar with the story and somewhat of a western fan to appreciate it. My husband watched the Lone Ranger growing up and really enjoyed the movie...he even watched it a second time. The way it was set up with Tonto in the present and past definitely added to the storyline.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to some of the violence with the Indians as it may be disturbing to some people...even though it is part of our history.",1388361600,2,656,4.2063492063492065
5824393,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I read many reviews this Summer about how much to avoid this movie by all the ""professional"" critics but many average people saying it was a good movie -- long but good.  I found it playing at a discount theater and decided to waste $2 and 2.5 hours.  I was really gladly surprised as were my friends that saw it with me.  They did say it was bloody, and it is, but not over the top and not gruesome in any way.  Language was capped as well, but there were a couple too many, ""Stupid White man"" jabs by Depp, verbatim quotes from the movie, that got tiring the third time around.
I am not a Depp fan at all but he was a great actor here, and the chemistry with Hammer worked well.  I did not even notice it was a long movie as I felt it needed the time to develop the characters and plot properly.
The movie is just a expose on big business corruption, power and greed.  It has a good message and shows that some people suffer at the hands of progress but are cast aside and forgotten.  Money talks and this story solidifies that notion.
The evolution of the Ranger is unique as his beliefs are not only challenged but his eyes are opened with the help of Tonto.

The look and feel of the period is spot on, complete with characters dirty teeth as you would expect at the time.  Great attention to detail.

I am not sure why every single Hollywood movie has to be a 90 minute four step formula for the critics to accept it -- does the mass public really need very simple stories and plots these days?

It's refreshing to see something worth my, in this case, $2 and more since I bought the Bluray now too.  It would be nice to see a sequel but I doubt the bean counters at the studios will allow it.",1388361600,3,1699,4.130699088145897

The bird on Tonto's head is pretty cool and has it's story line, you have to think a little, one gruesome scene, turn your eyes and silence your jeadset for a couple minutes, you will know when to do this.

There were some humorous, light-hearted parts between Tonto and the Lone Ranger, but then there would be a gruesome, violent scene. It was jarring. had my kids been naive enough to believe half the nonsense that happened in this movie. I would've hesitated to take them to watch it because of the violence. They would have to cover their eyes/ears for several scenes, and then would be lost as to what was going on in the movie. Plot was all over. The movie is also very long,  at 150 minutes. I think they were bored, but did not want to hurt my feeling by saying so. It was not an amazing movie.  Language was mild (about fifteen uses of the D word and H word total) and a brief scene in a brothel (women were in clothing from that time period). The tone was inconsistent, the messages seemed to try and be politically correct (something that was a bit distracting at times), and some elements of the story were stolen from other movies (The Mask of Zorro and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly come to mind). In the end, The Lone Ranger was an inconsistent movie..The film-maker's contempt for logic, narrative and coherence was manifested.

You spent the entire film listening to Claude Raine's voice but what you really took away was the image of seeing him lying on the bed as he becomes visible just before the character dies. What ""The Lone Ranger"" would have really benefitted from was a scene where Tonto takes off his ""war paint"" to reveal his face beneath.

5824457,3,B00DJYJWVW,"After hearing all of the bad reviews I almost didn't want to watch this movie. Surprisingly it was better than I thought it would be. It is far from perfect but is was entertaining in its own way. I won't give way the plot as too many people have already done that. I will list the good things of the movie that I enjoyed and the bad that could have made the film better:

Good:

- A lot of fast action and good special effects but too much as to overwhelm the storyline.
- A lot of good fight scenes
- Good acting in the major roles despite what many people say
- A reasonable storyline plot to the movie that was confusing at times due to the many sub plots

Bad:
- The movie was way too long at 2 hours and 29 minutes it could have been shorter by 30 minutes
- The action was at times just over the top and it overwhelmed the storyline
- The dialog in the script was just silly and poorly written
- To me the Lone Ranger of my childhood was an American icon and the film made him out to be a bumbling lawman who was a lawyer. Most of his feats in the film were supposedly done by pure blind luck.
- Tonto was made out to be a depressed and possibly mentally ill Indian that was an outcast even from his own tribe for being a traitor to his people
- There is an attempt to make this a comedy which at times worked and at other times the script fell flat on its face.

I liked the action part of the film and the acting of Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer saved the film from being a total bust. I believe that the audiences were confused on whether they were watching a western, a comedy film or a convoluted mess of a script. For me the film was a 3 1/2 stars as it started slowly and drug at times. The film should have been a total comedy or a serious remake of the Lone Ranger and Tonto saga. I personally don't know why Hollywood has to make every major character that people grew up revering into a character that acts like a clumsy incompetent clown.

The film needed a film direction in what type of movie it was supposed to be as well as be done in 120 minutes. Unfortunately none of this took place. That is why I rated it 3 stars.",1388275200,,2139,4.0

 I'm not sure what to say here. This movie could have had potential if they kept things simple.  Instead it's was just terrible.  It also turned a great show and characters into pure absurdity.  For example an elderly Tonto was talking to a young boy and telling the story.  However the dialog was just crap.  I would think that the purpose of that was to enhance the imagination of children, instead it just plays to the ignorance of kids who don't use any imagination anymore.

This movie is on the list with Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes, that TV Show Elementary, Godfather 3,  Indiana Jones 4, and soon to be added Ben Affleck Batman as destructions of great characters, TV shows, and movies

After about forty minutes, we had to give up on this as both too violent and too far off the lone ranger she remembers. I finished the movie later and the story isn't bad, it just isn't good and isn't close to what we were hoping for. The action was gritty and violent for the most part, the tragedies were pointless, the comedy felt way out of place, as though it'd been added to the movie after the fact to add content to the trailers.

I liked Johnny Depp in the role of Tonto - he does the slightly odd, sort of paranormal, role well - think beyond Pirates to Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd, Sleepy Hollow (the movie).

5824545,5,B00DJYJWVW,"There was Little Big Man that was ALL back story. And We've had the back story on Star Wars...
The back story on Lord of the Rings... WHY NOT the back story on the Lone Ranger!
as told by the ranger's ""wing-man""....  Unravel the secrets behind all those tacky bits
that every Lone Ranger episode managed to work into the script.
... and the enigmatic ending and the caution to ...never take your mask off... yes well...

This ""Back-story"" is loaded! There are so many subtle references
 to those early episodes and to the classic era of the Western good guys in the white hats
 and the horses who  were more accurate than GPS in finding the hero just in time to save his life,
that you will want to keep score and see how many you can name the original drama that made it
famous.

Johnny Depp is the archetypal ""wing man"" and his attire is a constant reminder that
wing man IS what he does.  Consider the flavors of the top gun wing man, who embodies
support and protection at all cost. Depp brings a sarcastic glaze of one lines
timed to precision and the man does his own stunts! I don't even think Tonto could claim that.
Meanwhile the Lone Ranger is kind of a King - fu master with a law degree preferring the path of
nonviolence until ONE day, they really hurt his feelings. Did I mention that there is a sassy wench
in homage to Blazing Saddles who saves the day in an innovative womanly way?  Yep, this film is
packed with those nods and winks to genre come and gone and come back again.
Like the nod to all those cowboy series that had to have a train chase or
two in every episode.  These are train chases on steroids though familiar like all those
over the top classics, the near miss track switch, the leap to the horse who knows exactly
which car has the hero in it, oh and the tunnel! What's a train bit without the tunnel shtick!

Can you tell.. I thought it was fabulous. And once again I am impressed with the wit, wisdom
and sophistication that Johnny Depp brings to the films he commits to. THIS one is where he
shows he is ready for the cross over to the other side of the camera lens.  Watch for it...",1388102400,2,2121,4.251243781094527
5824546,3,B00DJYJWVW,"It seems Disney movies are following this trend of lacking details lately. Dazzle the audience with action scenes and forget about the details. The audience will not notice because their attention span is too short.
Sometimes I wonder if that is what certain parties producing these films believe.
If you do not invest in a semi believable story than it becomes very difficult to stay with the movie. We are all critics after all.
Not sure whats going on with Disney lately. Need I bring up John Carter.
Some great potential with this one,however I can see where it fell short of delivering a number of times.
 Was that one bad guy that dressed up in womens clothing supposed to be funny or creepy?
Then the bird on Depps head. Really.. Come on. That's the best outfit you could come up with for Tonto. I gave it three stars for the action.",1388102400,2,840,4.526315789473684
5824547,5,B00DJYJWVW,"The Lone Ranger is currently on many ""critics"" Worst of 2013 lists. Everybody has an opinion, but critics are paid for their opinions because it gives the ""average"" movie-goes a leg up on what's worth paying $10.00 a ticket for. I did not get to see this film in the theaters because of the awful press it was getting, it was pulled early from locations around my area. So, I took a chance and bought a copy of the DVD on it's December release date. I was not disappointed after seeing the movie. There are some things wrong with this version of The Lone Ranger, but the right things outweigh the wrong ones. In my opinion, this film lived up to the trailers as being humerous, spectacular, and most of all exciting. The Long Ranger radio and TV show was aimed at kids, but was listened to and viewed by children as a forum for learning between right and wrong in an adult world; it taught lessons and very good ones at that. It taught honesty, good was supposed to win out over bad, do not judge a person by the tint of their skin, and loality should be earned through trust and honor. The Lone Ranger of 2013 was not like the Lone Ranger of the 30's, 40's, or 50's, but it was good enough to be watched and enjoyed for what it is: Believing the myth and learning from returning ""to those thrilling days of yesteryear when The Lone Ranger rides again"".",1388102400,2,1353,4.330708661417323

It's supposed to be funny when everyone else knows court is a joke.  Tonto knows the Lone Ranger is a joke.  The chase around the same outlaws.  It's a long movie and it feels long.

5824559,3,B00DJYJWVW,"Well.  It is watchable.  It's filled with gorgeous scenery.  There's loads of ""cartoon action.""  The buffalo were definitely animated.  Helena Bonham Carter is a hoot.  William Fichtner makes a great villain.  But.  The narration goes in one direction, the film in another.  The plot never stabilizes into a coherent, rational story.  At all times it defines logic and physics.  The humor is pure slapstick.  The few scenes where it turns serious, it turns deadly serious, then it jars you a step back with more humor.  There's a massacre that's rather grim.  There's an ambush that ends with cannibalism.  Greed is at the heart of the story but it takes forever before that's revealed.  You won't want for villains in this movie, there's several too many (and the main three have nonspecific/questionable demises that beg for a sequel or two that no one expects at this point in time).  Sadly, Armie Hammer makes a bland hero.  As for Johnny Depp, it's clear at the outset that he's not the other guy's sidekick, he's the STAR of the picture.  Which makes no sense at all, especially for someone like me who grew up watching the original TV series.  Very little of this bares any resemblance to the original except for THAT song, wisely played at one point to great effect.  Otherwise, I did like it, sort of, so I guess I wouldn't mind seeing it again someday, definitely not soon...............  But I can certainly see why the critics hated it and why no one flocked to the theater to see it and why it lost so much money (foreign and domestic).  It's not quite Howard the Duck but it's close.",1388102400,3,1597,4.66546762589928

He took his abilities to another place with a voice I can't ever remember hearing and comedy with slices of wisdom built in. Although too ridiculous in places to conceive as ever happening, it adds to the comic relief. My perspective is the original stories were shown to be cover ups for more western genocide, bigotry, etc.  The ridiculous character of this script allowed us to see the hollowness of the ""american"" manifest destiny with comedic relief.  Who'd a thunk it possible.  I guess it is with Johnny Depp. Only he could have pulled this off. I'll watch it again.  It will become a cult classic.",1388102400,3,715,4.650793650793651

I had heard so much bad from every possible source that it helped me when I came into watching it.  I thought, its the Lone Ranger, whats the worst that could happen?  Johnny Depp was funny, he was borderline between high and insane throughout most of the movie and Armie Hammer was exactly what he played, lacking confidence but as smart as they come.

5824568,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I was steered away from this film when it was in theatres last Summer because of the lukewarm critical and public reaction to it despite the fact that Johnny Depp is my wife's fantasy man.  I was intrigued when no less than an expert than Quentin Tarantino said it was one of the best films of the year.  The Q-Man has made a second career of promoting obscure or misunderstood films so I bit and I'm glad I did.  I don't know why this film laid an egg because it's terrific.  What director Gore Verbinski has done in 149 minutes is fashioned a Ranger (Armie Hammer) for the new millennium by giving him a plausible backstory.  Tonto, always the Ranger's monosyllabic sidekick, is fleshed out by Johnny Depp and given dimension that the character was never afforded before no offence to the late great Jay Silverheels.  Hammer and Depp have a terrific rapport with Depp doing a lot of improvising.  There's a terrific story involving the Ranger's nemesis Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and a corrupt railroad magnate(Tom Wilkinson).  Last but not least there are two mind boggling locomotive scenes the latter accompanied by the stirring ""William Tell Overture"" aka ""The Lone Ranger Theme"".

However, once The Lone Ranger and Tonto decide on their course of action, the film begins to get more interesting. In true Johnny Depp form, there are quirky characters that are tied together by an unfolding story. The film balances drama and humor, and by the end, I was thoroughly enjoying myself. I gave this 4 stars, because I was able to get lost in the adventure of this movie, but some of the film goes to gratuitous extremes. This is NOT a movie for children.

I chose to download the non--HD version of this movie because I really do not appreciate the difference between the two versions.  Nevertheless, even this version downloaded very poorly, stopping to buffer the download every couple of minutes or so.  In fact, although the movie runs a little over two hours, it took well over three hours to watch the whole thing because of all of the buffering that occurred.

As to the movie itself, I am a big Johnny Depp fan, but the script gave him very little to work with in terms of displaying his wide range of talents.  Sure, there were a few opportunities for good laugh scattered throughout, but on the whole the story was weak.  If this is supposed to be the first of a revival of the Lone Ranger franchise and assuming that the first would be the best, there is no point in resurrecting the long dead Lone Ranger.

I was apprehensive when I saw the cast announcements but Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp are both stellar in their roles.  Hammer plays a slightly clueless, fresh out of law school John Reid very well.  He is hesitant about his role in the changing world, he wants to stay true to his ideals and it is great to see the character grow and change as the movie progresses.  He is a little less idealistic by the end but still determined to serve justice.  Hammer takes a man fresh out of school and through this movie we see him grow into The Lone Ranger we all know and love.
Johnny Depp is a great slightly mad, revenge driven, very sarcastic Tonto.  He starts out as the teacher and ends up as an equal with John. It is great watching him teach John Reid to be The Lone Ranger.
The music is great, it is new and wonderful and suits the movie but still is true to the original material.  The catchphrases from the original show make their way into the movie in homage to the source.
In general I enjoyed this movie, it had a lot of comedic elements but it was also serious and spoke about the sad events of the time period it is set in.
If you enjoyed the classic show you should give this movie a shot!  Just remember, don't go into it expecting the show because this is it's own work and it stands alone.",1388016000,3,1493,4.2140350877192985

Now, I've seen it a total of two times and both times it's been equally enjoyable.
I've heard critics claim The Lone Ranger to be a flop simply because Johnny Depp's facial expressions were the same as his in The Pirates of the Caribbean; or because the action was identical to that of TPotC. Who cares? It was enjoyable! Isn't that what a movie is supposed to be? Raw, pure, unadulterated entertainment. When I viewed this movie in the theater, there was not a person who didn't bust up laughing.
Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer make a fantastic duo in this tribute to an old favorite. It's clean, epic, hilarious fun for the whole family. People who've stuck with Disney as its changed and developed over the years will surely love The Lone Ranger.",1388016000,2,945,4.564705882352941

5824594,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Though it was the Lone Ranger-like goofiness, it still took on a huge and most often unspoken theme when it comes to Westerns and Indians.  Often times movies that deal with this era and Indians, simply deal with the tragedy of slaughtering tribes and/or removing them off their lands, omitting the real motive of why it happened.  Which by leaving the real motive out of it, Indians always are portrayed as having some of the guilt for violent confrontation, like they were misunderstood or it was total misunderstanding between the two parties.  Though they may share part of the responsibility for confrontations, the fault of the other party is often looked over and, perhaps, forgiven for few reasons:  1. The motive is not discussed; therefore, it is not rooted into critical thinking, which this motive would have a great impact on it.  2. The other party, the U.S. government/army, is often looked on as a ""mistake"" or a separated tragedy for each incident, but were still right to having to fight.  3. The U.S. government/army won so they get to write the history.  4. The U.S. Army, as an organization, still lives today so they can preserve the ""taught"" history if only out of automatic acceptance by people.

[Warning: Spoilers beyond this point]
This movie, though it may not be anti-government, viewed the U.S. Army as incompetent and down right nefarious.  As the Captain, who resembled Col. Custer, in a scene found out that he was raiding (slaughtering) women and children because the Comanche was setup. He was persuaded to join the bad guys because he didn't want to look like he was incompetent.  The movie, however, made the point that incompetence does not override the evil that can be espoused by an individual, nor is ignorance an excuse from the consequences of violating higher law.  In another scene with the Captain, he pointed his guns at a defenseless boy, and he was willing and about to shoot before the hero rescued the child.  The Captain was worried about looking good in history and to his superiors, but wasn't concern about the evil he was espousing whether he was incompetent or not. Everybody has choices.  The Captain along with his men made the choice of slaughtering defenseless people for a cause that they did not envisioned themselves.

The main bad guy kept saying themes like vision and progress.  What he was getting at was Manifest Destiny.  Basically, it is where colonists of America believe that they were to make this land (America) a holy land and they were destined for it because God decreed it.  Also, they believed (or believe) that they are to rid the land of the evil within it.  This is displayed in movie as prayers and having Christians traveling on the train going out west.  This was their vision.  Their progress was to take land from others forcefully.  This is only an illusion since the vision and progress is simply theft and murder. This was displayed in fractal manner with the main bad guy.  He couldn't get a wife or have kids of his own so he had to murder the father/husband of a family and attempt to take them as his own in order to setup a neat picturesque lifestyle when there was no love involved.

However, Manifest Destiny, when it comes down to it, was nothing but greed fueled by lust.  It used religion, love, and ""progress"" to run over and destroy everybody that was in their way.  Instead of being just upright by trading and negotiating and not trying to take it all by force and cheating, they slaughtered innocents, then rewrote history to deviate the truth.  The movie used a railroad and trains as a metaphor to demonstrate this.  All of today's reverence for the Christian themed history and United Nation means nothing if we ignore these facts. It wasn't Christianity or for a ""uniting a nation"" the reason for these events so folks who say it was for patriotic reasons is only believing a lie. This isn't to include a large portion of the travelers in history, but mainly the more celebrated events in history.

The crux of the movie, which revolved around the hero, the Lone Ranger, being a law man and believing in justice.  However, at the end of the movie, the railroad company invited him to be their lawman.  That is, to have an officer of the law represent not the people of the state but men who was rich enough to control the government and implement Manifest Destiny. One of the rich railroad men told him to take off the mask as to show his identity and to become one of them.  The Lone Ranger said no.  This to keep his anonymity and his individuality.  He remained as the Lone Ranger and sought true justice.  A justice that goes both ways.  Justice doesn't solely belong to the powerful nor should they have a monopoly conducting it, but that justice is the responsibility of every individual.

And, there is a bit of sci-fi in this movie if you can spot it. Hint: It's in the cave.",1388016000,2,4894,4.663170163170163

However, the movie just felt jumbled.  One scene would be heartfelt and tragic while cutting back and forth to the main characters doing something ridiculous and silly.  It had no tone or feeling for more than a few seconds and I found myself just hating all of the characters.

This movie is crap even though it clearly had so much potential and talent.  We never even bothered to finish the last 30-40 minutes of this 2:30 movie.",1388016000,2,572,4.785714285714286

I am not that old (just reaching middle age) and still have a recollection of my fondness for the show. However this is not anything like the Lone Ranger of old, nor should it be. Times have changed and expectations of blockbuster hero movies have changed. It is sad that Disney has to dive into the fray of violent and over-commercialized movies. They used to be known as the family-friendly option. This movie is not family friendly! I would not show my 5-year-old this movie, but I would certainly watch it with another adult or older teen. Violence-warning aside, Johnny Depp is the one that steals the show in terms of acting. The rest of the cast play their part and the storyline is easy enough to follow. I would watch this a second time. I hope that it gets more traction as a rental than it did in the theaters.",1388016000,,943,4.303370786516854

5824602,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Usually the reason all these years I have been a Johnny Depp fan is that the more intense and provocative the film gets with him, there is a main theme or point he wishes to get across to film viewers. Also he doesn't give a rats' behind if critics don't get what he is trying to educate people. In the Lone Ranger he does all that and more, because he wants to get you to think why now Native Americans still suffer on some of their reservations, and why back only in the 1800's they were considered savage. This film must be viewed more than once. People should do a little research on their own about some of the customs predicated in the film. Tonto's trading of a feather, rocks, and a dead mouse for other items. I am part Cherokee and Apache, and I will never understand the treatment of all the tribes that were here in North America. We owe many of them for certain vegetables, and ways of drying meat. All in all Verbinski utilized the locations they shot on to best depict the way of life back in the Ole' West. That said I can't wait until Transcendence comes out next April 2014, as Johnny sheds all the makeup and takes on a different role again.",1388016000,2,1160,4.277272727272727

5824604,3,B00DJYJWVW,"I never watched the old Lone Ranger show, so I can't compare the movie to it.  I liked this movie well enough, though not enough to buy or see it again.  My mom, who had chosen this for our Xmas movie, had hated it.

The beginning of the movie was a bit confusing.  It starts out with a young boy visiting an Old West exhibit in 1933, and he strikes up a conversation with a wax figure of Tonto that suddenly comes to life.  The movie makes time jumps back and forth, and you have to really pay attention to keep track of things.

The movie has a strong plot and keeps a good pace, but it is just a bit too long for the average attention span.

Though it has its funny moments, it also shows quite a bit of violence that doesn't really make it suitable as a comedy (i.e.  they have a guy that is a partial cannibal and you see people getting wiped out--there are also references to the threat of rape).  My mom had expected a comedy, and that was one of the reasons why she didn't like this.  I guess really this is more of an action film than anything.

I'm not sure another problem with the film was that it was trying not to do anything that could be considered offensive to Native Americans. I don't know what the original series was like, but the thing about shows from an older period is that they come from a time when it was socially acceptable to make fun of minorities and people who were different from you.  These days, we are more sensitive.  Though a film shouldn't be offensive, sometimes they can be too self-conscious.

The characters were well developed and likable.  Johnny Depp was an endearing Tonto.  I don't know if Helena Bonham Carter's character was really necessary and could have been cut to reduce the length of the movie, but she was entertaining.  The other actors were really good in their roles.",1388016000,2,1828,4.329411764705882

It's rather long.  Since I have two more rental days on it I may try to watch again before falling asleep, and maybe there are answers to the questions I have.

Questions I have as a non-Lone fan, only relying on this movie for info on the character.  There's some pieces of the title character's story missing that make this the three star movie. Questions like: Why does Lone not want to shoot a gun and didn't for the past eight years? I'm getting a slight hint that it had something to do with Lone's dad's Ranger experience?  How did Lone get so good with a gun but then turned against it?  Why is Lone initially portrayed as bumbling and merely lucky when he gets the bad guys and then later he's very skilled and the hero? Why did he leave the woman he loves and has no bad feelings with his brother about him taking her, and why is brother so cool with telling Lone she liked him best?  One character asked why the woman was so desired, not just by Lone and his brother, but also by this other old dude.  I wonder too.  Why is Lone's 'wild' horse already tame or was it just a stray?  Why is the law that Lone studied so exalted that it washes away any anger and internal struggle with wanting instant justice against the man that horribly murdered someone (see I'm not spoiling it)?  There are some bad guys that dress weird, really weird, and they question why Lone wears the mask, how can that mask be so unusual to people dressed that way that they'd make a comment (and ignore Tonto)?

The comedic banter, the action, the story, ...in each, enough things are missing that the suspension of belief needed to sit back and just enjoy this action-adventure retelling of the Lone Ranger can't be sustained before questions pop up and then that distraction leads to looking for a good spot to hit the pause button and do something else.",1388016000,2,2017,4.332446808510638

There were some spots of no action that seemed to drag on, but when you got to the action parts-it was almost overwhelming, but so entertaining.  I am of the westerns generation and love a good old fashioned western, but do appreciate those made with some humor.  This one combined the best of both.  Tonto had always been a minor character without much intelligence, relying on the Lone Ranger for getting them out of trouble.  HERE, Tonto shows an intelligence and mind of his own giving equality to both stars.

5824625,1,B00DJYJWVW,"Start by noting the title should not be ""The Lone Ranger"" but rather ""Let's Make Fun of The Lone Ranger"". It could be the movie is about the Johnny Depp character trying to rescue this film by rescuing the farcical character of The Lone Ranger. In the process of making sport of The Lone Ranger, the makers of this film seemed to forget that a film needs to have a central purpose, something to acheive, something to guide the film makers. This movie never quite came together as either funny or interesting. I'm not sure whether to blame the directors, writers or film editors for several disjointed, inexplicable turns in the unfolding of the presentation. Notice I write ""presentation"" and not plot. As a camel is the creation of a committee trying to make a horse, this movie looks like a committee of cynical executives and super-cool film types made a list of things they wanted in a movie and set out to string these nodules together. In looking back on this movie, the moving forces behind this movie must have a philosophical dedication to seeing life itself as self-contradicting and chaotic. Even within the movie dialogue itself the jumping around to the scenes forced a semi-humorus reference to the lameness of the sequencing of the presentation - almost an apology to an attentive audience. It was obvious that Johnny Depp was supposed to rescue this movie. His talents were wasted on the poverty of imagination displayed in the script, but it could be the writers were forced to write it this way. The film used a magnificent train wreck to spice up the beginning of the film with danger and noise. Depp portrayed a Native American hunter of evil spirits, the kind of evil spirit that warps a man's soul into a fountain of darkness. But I would not blame those with ethnic sensitivities for being offended by the way they built this New Age Tonto. This new Tonto had a stuffed crow on his head as something like a spirit guide. So the film tries to use New Age spiritualism to add some flair. Depp's new Tonto strongly resembled Captain Jack Sparrow, which Depp played previously, in the way the new Tonto jumped and climbed a lot. In cobbling these Depp traits together, the film makers were like cooks adding a little bit of this and a little bit of that hoping the result would cash in on all that Depp could bring to the film. Beyond Depp himself, the majority of actors did their jobs well. The characters the actors portrayed were oddly used, and the ways the characters were woven into the body of the film were oddly directed. Within this film the character of The Lone Ranger was disagreeable and it was difficult to find anything redeeming enough in the character to take an interest in him. In the end, my conclusion was the originators of this film presentation started out sneering and laughing at a man who loved decency and justice and they intended to make a public laughing stock of The Lone Ranger character. This film was not about The Lone Ranger, but then again it is hard to say what this film is really about. If this film was meant to hold up symbols of decency and courage and ridicule them, the film achieved its purpose.",1388016000,8,3163,4.609929078014185

I was pleasantly surprised because the movie got so many negative reviews, it was actually well done and a fun time. I liked Depp much more as Tonto than I ever did as Jack Sparrow. Yes the ol' Lone Ranger purists (really? lol) don't like it because Tonto was made into a fun character and played by a white guy (omg no! It's like the 1800's all over again!).

I plan to buy the video for my small library so I can watch it again. I like the action and the humor. It's really a modern day version of an old story of why the Lone Ranger exists. Watch the film with an open mind. If you like it, you will - if you don't like, you won't. If you've ever watched ""The Green Mile"" or ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", you'll get the general idea of how the story is being told, which is from an old person's perspective, by reminiscing about the past and by telling the history of events which occurred during that time.",1388016000,,831,4.036363636363636

This was a great movie!
It was the drama of how the Lone Ranger came about. Once these characters were enjoyably developed, and with the help of Tonto, he learned to be THE LONE RANGER. Then the action adventure commenced, TA DA!
I am very sorry that there will be no sequels.
And as for the accusations that Johnny Depp just used his Pirates persona for Tonto, I do not agree. He was really into Charlie Chaplin this time.
I did see that the writers used some bits that Johnny Depp fans absolutely loved in his other movies.
So?  We loved those bits in this movie also!
Johnny Depp has never used the same character for any of his movies, and they are always a little off center, to the delight of his fans!
I wish that this movie had received the ratings it deserved from the beginning so that we could enjoy another fun set of Johnny Depp movies.

He gives an understated performance as a man who has suffered great tragedy, and yet is able to project humor with only the slightest change in expression or tone. He is either the sanest most spiritual man one could meet, or a complete madman. It is left to the viewer to decide. Armie Hammer is a Dudley Do-Right kind of lawman as the Lone Ranger, whom Tonto often has to save from his own incompetence. Most people who didn't like the movie had a problem with his character. I agree you wanted to slap him periodically, but there was so much involved in this movie, it fit very well. There was great sadness for the fate of the Comanche and horrific violence, some nods to the old Lone Ranger character that had those of us old enough to remember him, smiling, as well as great humor of both wit and slapstick that kept viewers ranging from 16 and up, laughing. There were few cliches, so you really didn't know what was going to happen next, let alone at the end. Some reviews felt the movie was too long, but I can't say I felt that way. I was so involved in what was going on, I didn't notice the time but really enjoyed it. Just a caveat - it is rated PG-13 for a good reason. The violence is quite brutal, although not that bloody.

The story is unique. If you are expecting and expanded TV version of the Lone Ranger you will be disappointed. Armie Hammer brings a cool sometimes frightened demeanor to this place that is supposed to be home but feels more like hell to him. He caught the right balance of east coast new lawyer/ DA and a man hit with loss after loss. To avoid spoilers I will only say that he has dirt under his fingernails and his clothes look like he has ridden in them for days.

Enter Tonto. Johnny Depp nails it. Need  I say more?  Depp's Tonto is not the sidekick of TV fans. He drives the plot. He is droll and understated and PERFECT! His make up and clothing were taken from an autobiography called,; I am Crow.' Being a fan of the true old west I was really impressed by the costuming throughout the film.

The story is vaguely like most westerns; revenge for the slain brother, justice for the widow and friendship between two unlikely men, but woven through it are several subplots that bring the characters depth.

The stunt scenes are epic. One of riding a horse along the top of a moving train is gasp-worthy!
we literally got to the final scene and wanted to watch all over again. Three adults who remember the origin TV Lone Ranger are all impressed. Be sure to watch the credits and watch the bloopers. Like I said we will treasure this one and watch it over and over.

If you remember city Slickers and how it made you feel, this is for you. And for the nay sayers... everyone is entitled to his own opinion. Maybe you just aren't a fan of a new take on an old story.

5824671,1,B00DJYJWVW,"First off, at nearly 2-1/2 hours, it's way too long.  If it were a compelling film, maybe that would be different.  Also WAY overproduced, often extremely unbelievable, with way too many special effects. Add to that, often very cartoonish. It's a Disney film.........not a slap on Disney, but maybe I was expecting too much from them. I'll be 59 in two weeks so I'm old enough to remember the TV series The Lone Ranger starring Clayton Moore as The Lone Ranger and Jay Silverheels as Tonto. Oh yeah............Silverheels was actually an Indian. Johnny Depp did an admirable job with what he was given.............a poor script, overproduction and a dead bird mounted on his head.  Does anyone think a real Indian would mount a dead bird on his head?  But did Depp really come off as an Indian? Well, no...........he came off as a white guy playing an Indian. Armie Hammer as The Lone Ranger seemed like a cartoon character, especially compared to Clayton Moore.

 The original series was SO believable, the acting was so great. And this new version is SO lame in comparison! I compare this disparity to all the vampire films of the last 20-30 years. Lots of blood, lots of special effects...............but none even comes close to the 1932 classic, ""Dracula"", starring Bela Lugosi. And Lugosi's Dracula never even drew blood...........he just bared his ""fangs"".

 If you're going to remake an old classic film or TV series.............get the message............throwing tons of cash and special effects into the project just ain't going to get it done. Not hard to see why this year's The Lone Ranger was a commercial failure.  Don't waste your time...............amazon has a DVD of the first 16 episodes of the original Lone Ranger TV series.......for $6.96!",1387929600,18,1763,5.010273972602739

Having been too young to watch and listen to the original lone ranger series when it originally was aired, I did as a kid see them as reruns, I can see where the criticisms come from when comparing the two as this is not what I would consider the Lone Ranger as it was originally intended. With that being said, if you strictly compare the two, then yes this version will fail to live up to your expectations, especially if you grew up on the original. But if view this as something different, then this movie although not a classic, is fun and entertaining. Yes the character interaction and lines are a bit campy, the action over the top, and the movie a bit too long at times but it did keep me entertained. I did think the flashbacks (or flash forwards as they were) with the little boy at the carnival were a bit distracting from the movie and really felt out of place and kind of ruin the pacing of the film. I would almost compare this movie as a mix of Wild Wild West (which this movie is better) and Pirates of the Carribean (which this movie is not as good as). This movie has a mix of light-hearted humor, sarcasm, and some violence and tries to entertain all ages, which actually I think it is its biggest problem. It tries to go after every type of audience and sometimes gets in its own way.

With all that being said, I say don't necessarily listen to the critics and go and judge this movie for yourself. If you keep an open mind and don't try to compare to the original Lone Ranger series, then you might find like I did, that this movie was entertaining and worth a watch.",1387929600,3,1791,4.267647058823529

After reading all the press about this when it came out last summer, I avoided seeing it until now, but having just finished watching it, I'm surprised it was so disliked.  It's maybe not as inspired as Pirates, but let's be honest Pirates wasn't THAT good either.  I thought Depp was funny and the overall story was entertaining.  Considering how many people loved Iron Man 3 last summer which I thought WAS boring (just another CGI bonanza), I don't understand why some movies catch on and others don't. Maybe a bit of Depp fatigue? (not to be confused with his hits, aka Depp charges)

Anyway, I think most people would enjoy this movie, it won't change your life, but it has a few good chuckles and some good action and, for me at least, worth watching.  A worthy summer blockbuster, but definitely subpar of a great like Dark Knight.",1387843200,2,886,4.582278481012659

I was pleased to hear the William Tell Overture used -- that was actually why I watched it, so I could tell my music students to listen for it (we use the Overture in some music activities).  I waited to watch this on Prime Video rather than spending big bucks at a theatre.

5824710,5,B00DJYJWVW,"When I was a kid I watched the Lone Ranger everyday after school. It was in black and white, the Lone Ranger had a trick horse and could do amazing trick shots that foiled the bad guys, he always used silver bullets. At the end of every episode he waved his hat and said ""Hiho Silver! Away!"". Tonto was his faithful friend and they brought justice to the old west. Yeah, Tonto said things in a corny way, but it's the 40's and 50's and I doubt Tonto talking like a college graduate would have been very convincing at that time. Try to translate that into present day and you have a challenge.
I liked that they made pointed references to the the things that made the Lone Ranger what he was. I like how they viewed it with humor because now a days those things aren't perceived as being realistic. Would an actual American Indian playing Tonto been more authentic? Sure, but aren't actors supposed to be playing a part that isn't them? I was actually impressed with Johnny Depp's performance in that he DIDN'T channel Jack Sparrow into his performance. People are so tied up with not offending minorities these days we never stop to think things like, ""Did the actor treat the character with respect?"" First of all, ask a American Indian if they were offended. Secondly, this is a period piece and Indians were seen as uncivilized and savages. Lastly, Tonto had a way of speaking that marked him as Tonto so yeah, he said the ""Me um's"" and spoke with broken English. If they made the movie politically correct it would be boring! I also think it's a good thing to remember that there was a time people thought that way and it should remind us now how we need to look beyond what we see and try to truly understand the people around us for who they are and not what we perceive them to be by their surface appearance. I think that Tonto's reason for being locked up made that point very clear when he said his crime was, ""Indian"".
I was thoroughly entertained by this movie, yes it is over the top but I don't go to the movies for a repeat of the television show. Good solid story and acting by the entire cast and it is one of those movies I have watched more than once and still enjoyed the same each time. When the William Tell overture played I got excited, it really took me back to those times of watching the TV show and hearing the music play whenever the exciting part of the show began. I'm 42 years-old and I still got up and pranced around like I was riding a horse enjoying the memories and giving my family a laugh. Awesome Movie!",1387843200,3,2543,4.34453781512605

5824712,3,B00DJYJWVW,"I liked the themes presented in this movie. They are morally valid, deeply felt and deeply convincing. It's just, I'm an adult. Not a twelve year old. And I guess that's the audience eliott and rossio are going for, aside from toggling to adult audiences on occasion in the narrative. The feel of the movie was theme ride along with ""western movie trope recycling,"" everything from ""The great train robbery"" to ""Once upon a time in the west"" to "" a few dollars more"" to the silent movies where the heroine is tied to the railroad tracks by the Evil Villein and it is the hero's job to rescue her. this, of course is all new for those who've never seen. Lastly, the point by the other reviewer of partial native american descent is taken- the story of genocide is always disturbing, always a rent in the fabric of the continuing tale of humanity. To have it represented in the form of cartoon villeins is, well, good for a twelve year old. To have it depicted as the overwhelming truth about the west, well, I wasn't there, so I can't say. It does smack of a simplistic interpretation. Maybe it's true. What I think the movie misses are the larger points of the tides of humanity at that point in history, justifying the cartoonification of the events depicted.

5824722,2,B00DJYJWVW,"I liked the Pirates of the Caribbean, Gore Verbinski (the director), and Johnny Depp. So when Disney tried to rekindle that same magic that was so successful, but in the Old West, it didn't quite work out.

Let's start with what was good:
1) Both leading actors (Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer) both did excellent jobs; they were convincing and emotive when necessary.
2) The production was top notch, and I wouldn't expect anything less from Disney.
3) The locations and sets were authentic looking
4) It was great that the original ""Lone Ranger Theme"" was, in fact, used in the movie. And it was also great that they used it sparingly and ONLY at the right moment for heightened effect. Nice touch!
5) I liked the bad guy - I don't know who he is, but he was ""good"".

Now what I didn't like about this flick:
1) Though both actors did a fine job, in many parts were their portrayals simply cheesy, campy, and over-the-top. Just too cartoonish for my taste.
2) The dialogue - some of the exchanges amongst the characters were just (oh, there is that word again!)...CHEESY!

And for the BIGGEST culprit of this flick....the Lone Ranger is SNIVELING WIMP.

Yes, that is correct. The director, for some reason, decided to make this supposedly brave character out to be a whiny wimp. It was really hard to get past that throughout the film. who wants their hero to be whiny and wimpy?

This version is NOT bland and answers the questions I had about Tonto's history in particular. Parts are very violent and parental guidance is recommended for little ones. All in all - it's fun and does what a movie should do and that is to entertain for a couple of hours. I don't look to movies for my spiritual awakenings . I don't expect long lasting redeeming social value. It's a film and it is well shot and directed. The bad guys are very bad and the good guys are good - but not sugary sweet.,1387756800,2,620,4.175

Do you know that there are over 25 different movies out that follow this book? It is a beloved tale with a following worldwide. The Lone Ranger is also a beloved tale that has a following, but what's wrong with someone making a different version? I find it strange that critics ripped this movie to shreds before it even hit the open market, but then again,every time the critics trash a movie, I have found them to be wrong.
If we all followed what the critics say, we would all be missing out on the best entertainment available. We are all entitled to our opinions, but if you only read the negative comments, and pass on this movie, I personally believe you would be missing out.",1387756800,4,975,4.362637362637362

Of course no horse would do the things Silver does in this movie so some of the scenes were obviously faked.  Monument Valley is wonderful backdrop.  Funny/sad lines like when Tonto, asked why he had been arrested, replies, ""Indian""; that was reason enough in the western frontier.",1387756800,2,585,4.686274509803922

Character development is good, but he almost never progressed beyond a buffoon.  The Lone Ranger is a hero-  this guy made Hong Kong Fooey look serious--  if you doubt this, go ahead and watch the thing and see, but this movie is a dud.  Tom Wilkinson,James Badge Dale and Ruth Wilson are the only ones that are believable in their roles--  the others were just campy.

Entertaining as a parody on the old TV and movie versions. Saw it in the same vane as Pirates of the Caribbean. Maybe its because we remembered the old TV series and the old movie version. We didn't try to judge it on its cinematic merits or how closely it followed the original story line. It was just plain fun to watch.,1387756800,3,483,4.204301075268817

There is violence but in most movies you would see the heart being cut out with lots of screams, blood shooting out everywhere.

5824785,4,B00DJYJWVW,"His name is John Reid.  He rode a train out west to become a prosecutor, seeking justice in the court of law.  But after his Texas Ranger brother is killed in an ambush, Reid finds himself paired with a mysterious Comanche outcast named Tonto.  Together, the two will fight to bring corruption to its knees, and a band of murders to justice.

Let's get two things out of the way up front.  1) THE LONE RANGER isn't nearly as bad as the critics and Box Office would have you believe.  Not hardly.  Rumor has it, critics reviewed an early cut of the film months before release.  Can't say if that's true or not, of course, but it's worth considering.  2)  Pay attention, parents: this is a PG-13 film, but barely.  There are overt references to prostitution, cannibalism, racism, butchery, and questionable romantic liaisons (Reid's crazy for his brother's wife).  Not to mention the moral questions the film raises, and frequent violence.  I'm no prude when it comes to what I think kids should watch, but even I hesitate to call this a ""family friendly film.""

Okay, that aside: THE LONE RANGER is actually a pretty good film.  It's overlong by 30 minutes or so, and features a godawful framing device that actually interrupts the narrative at points.  And there's little reason for Johnny Depp's Tonto to be so over-the-top; the film tries explaining it (to a degree), and while interesting, it doesn't offer much.  But beyond that, we've got a handful of great performances: Depp manages to be both dramatic and subtle; Armie Hammer proves he can be a leading man, with enough talent and charisma to draw you into the character; the ever-reliable Tom Wilkinson doing his usual; William Fichtner as a cannibalistic lunatic; and smaller roles filled out marvelously by Helena Bonham Carter, James Badge Dale, and Barry Pepper.  Director Gore Verbinski delivers high-octane action, set against stunning scenery and incredible effects.  Remember how refreshing and fun the first PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN was?  This isn't quite on that scale, but it's close.

Ultimately, give THE LONE RANGER a chance.  Is it a classic?  No.  But it's surprisingly dark and edgy, and looks pretty damn good.  The story is strong; while purists may complain about a few changes here and there, this is ultimately an interesting take on the legend.  Perhaps not for everyone, but if you like high-octane action with a nihilistic twist, this one's right up your alley.",1387670400,,2446,4.87621359223301

5824787,4,B00DJYJWVW,"After reading all of the bad reviews, I watched this movie expecting to be disappointed and bored.  No, it was funny, exciting and great.  I truly loved it. When the William Tell Overture started playing I cheered and clapped.  I was entertained and amused by all of it.  Mr. Hammer seemed uncomfortable in his role, but the other actors made up for it.  I thought Johnny Depp did not portray an Indian but a human being with a mission and defined his odd role as a sidekick as a  man with mental illness needing a partner.  I think having an Indian actor would have made the movie fall flat.  By giving Tonto an irreverent personality and oddness, it became a more logical pairing.  Why would a tribal Indian, during the time of battle with the United States, have become a friend and partner to a white man?  Only an Indian that was labeled an outlaw or crazy would have left his village. I know that the expense of this movie and the poor reviews will kill any chance of a second movie and I am sad.

5824800,1,B00DJYJWVW,"Pretty awful.  The opening Rube Goldberg/Wily Coyote opening (and it ends that way too) was a warning.  In fact, when I saw how long the movie was I hesitated.  I grew up on the Lone Ranger TV series and a couple of the movies and so was pleased to see this movie coming out thinking it might spark a renewed interest in the character.  The fact that Johnny Depp was playing Tonto added to my interest.  When I saw Depp's crow headdress I had more misgivings.  Still, I decided to get the film when it came out.

In addition to the Rube Goldberg problems there are two others that sink this production.  The first is Armie Hammer.  He acts the character instead of getting into it.  It reminds me of the TV season when Clayton Moore took off in protest for what he was getting paid and they had John Hart fill the role (given a mask that was not necessarily a problem) but Hart couldn't act.  I recall one scene with him where the thought crossed my mind, ""He seems to be thinking 'I can't act and it's the only thing I know how to do.'""  Hammer's delivery is wooden and emotionless.

The second problem is that the people who put the movie together couldn't seem to decide what kind of movie they wanted to make.  The bit with the young boy visiting the 'museum' where the old Tonto comes alive is contrived and the boy cannot act.  I'm not sure why it's there except...no, I cannot think of any reason.  There are Sci/Fi moments like the ivory leg on the saloon keeper's leg, then more reasonable ones like the Indians attacking and getting massacred, then moments where they seem to be spoofing the TV series.  The train scene in the final Rube Goldberg moment where 'Silver' is riding along the tops of the moving trains is, literally, the final straw.  It isn't funny and it isn't good Sci/Fi....and it isn't good fantasy either.

There are a few, very, good things about it.  Depp does his best to salvage matters.  Cavendish is well played as the epitome of evil.  There are a few good lines like at the end when Hammer has Silver leap up and Depp says, ""Don't do that again.""

Before the movie was released Depp did the talk show bit promoting the movie.  I don't recall any Hammer appearances.  The fact is that my initial fears on seeing the opening Wily Coyote sequence were fulfilled.  Too bad.",1387670400,9,2306,4.418052256532066

It was too good for the people who just want to pretend we live in a world of fake super heroes and mindless special effects. There were plenty of things to please those people in The Lone Ranger, but challenging all the greed, duplicity, and downright evil of the wild wild West couldn't appeal to anyone who supports our gun culture.
The Lone Ranger wears a white hat and doesn't carry a gun. Tonto is not a stereotypical victim or villain; he is a tortured and suffering man with a mission to right a great wrong.

Hello...!  It is the lone Lone Ranger being done by Disney. Disney took a larger then life fictional character and, well...made the Ranger and Tonto larger then life.

A very entertaining movie done in the shadow of, and in the same mode as, four ""Pirate..."" films with Johnny Depp. It is a little slow in a place or two, but the comic sequences were excellent. With his off hand comments about and facial expressions working with John Reid and his horse (""something wrong with that horse) I felt a little like Johnny Depp did for the character of Tonto what Kelsy Grahmer did for the character of ""Fraiser."" The train chase moments were pure Disney/Pirates style offerings and added to the film with the Lone Ranger theme adding a nice touch in the final chase.

All in all, a good buy.",1387670400,3,955,4.502890173410405

I imagined a darker, more serious toned epic with Tonto weaving a mystical spiritual tale of suffering and phoenix like resurrection for the two characters but this movie doesn't take that view at all. This is a clumsy, slapstick mess. It attempts to lend gravity to the plight of the indigenous peoples, but then makes a mockery of it the next scene by tossing in goofy antics and deadpan facial expressions from Depp around every other corner. There are no stand out performances at all and mainly Depp seems miss cast as Tonto despite his claims of having Indian blood it doesn't seem to make him any more believable at all. Casting a real Indian would have given the movie more weight and merit regarding the genocidal massacre of the original Americans.

Terrible script, screenplay and direction. I mainly fault the director because aside from a couple of fun/cool action sequences there's almost no reason to watch this slopfest.",1387584000,,1046,4.843575418994414

True, I was constantly annoyed with the portrayal of the Lone Ranger as an inept fool and Tonto as a Jack Sparrow-in-Indian-garb freak, but once I accepted this and moved on, I was able to enjoy the ridiculous action (horses climbing up to roof tops and then leaping 20 feet down).  The final battle on the trains was fun to watch, and when the famous Lone Ranger music score started, I felt a rush of excitement for the first time in the movie.  My 7 and 5 year olds thought it was boring at first, but they liked it later on.

5824823,2,B00DJYJWVW,"It tries to be funny, slapstick at times, wink at you one in awhile, attempting to be fun. It fails most of the time and comes off as just very stupid.
It tries to be ""The Crow"" of the west, a gritty revenge tale, seeking vengeance and justice against those guilty. It fails, as the Lone Ranger himself, comes across as a goody two shoes, who can't stomach guns and has a laughable sense of justice. So you will never like the very hero the film is about.
It tries to be a action movie, but it fails, as the over the top action is anything but entertaining, it's laughable.
The only character we care about is Tonto, but without Depp's performance, his tale, would have lacked as well.
It can't decide what it wants to be, and because of which it breaks immersion time and time again.
Want to enjoy the comedy? A dude's heart gets cut out. Want to enjoy the action? A horse is in a tree with a cowboy hat on. Want to enjoy the drama? Oh, well the Loan Ranger, pretty much acts like Shaggy from Scooby do, with a Captain America sense of justice. Want to enjoy the love story? Well guess what, there is no chemistry and not to mention his brothers wife.
This is a jumbled messed of a film, that has very brief moments of something entertaining.
I rented it, and I almost feel like it was a rip off and I didn't get my money's worth but I guess it's close to the value.
Sometimes I like movies that get negative press, and people don't like. This isn't one of them.
Glad I rented it, which is the best I can suggest for people to do, because it stinks.

The impression that I was left with was the objective of this movie was to ridicule the traditional image and reputation of the Lone Ranger.  The traditional image as I have come to know it, is an image of a bold, street-smart and intelligent cowboy who carried out justice in the pattern that Wyatt Earp did or that Karl did in Lonesome Dove.  But in this movie it seemed that the Lone Ranger theme was manipulated to actually portray someone who is not the Lone Ranger of the past movies but just some nincompoop whose name just happens to be the Lone Ranger.  I was disappointed with the movie's portrayal of the Lone Ranger and Tonto.  This movie should be done again and bring in a stronger characterization of both Tonto and the Lone Ranger.  This movie might go over better if it were renamed the Lone Simpleton.

Johnny Depp did an average job playing Tonto. I'm not sure its the actors fault. The story never caught my interest even when The Lone Ranger theme began playing. Regardless I would caution anyone from paying to see this film. Wait for it to come out on a platform where you can see it for free.

Leading lady was plain vanilla as was the kid playing her son.  Kid being told the story by the poorly aged Tonto, looked like a cartoon character out of a Disney flick.

Story itself was convoluted, long, tedious and had not even a tenuous grasp of realitycartoonish to the nth degree.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised as it was a western, PoC vehicle for Depp. Some decent action scenes, but even those were always totally unbelievably and outlandish.  Was always waiting for it to get better.  Kept waiting and waiting.  Comedy, for the most part, fell flat.

5824843,5,B00DJYJWVW,"""The Lone Ranger"" - It has it's share of little flaws to pick at (mostly concerning an overabundance of quirk) and it may prove to be a chore to get through a heavily burdened 2nd act (a good 20 minutes could easily be excised), but the payoff was well worth it for myself. An expertly cut, climactic, dueling train sequence, set to the William Tell Overture (or The Lone Ranger's theme), reaches cinematic gold- it's one of the best Directed, stunt-heavy, cliffhanger-esque action sequences in years. I felt like a kid again and apparently several of those audience members who were clapping did, as well.

The film is absolutely gorgeous to look at (the on-location footage of Monument Valley, Utah, is awesome) and you can actually see where the money went. It's not lathered in CGI or edited with a weed whacker- it's a spacious, grand-style throwback featuring impressive, tangible set pieces, with only the occasional digital assist (courtesy of Industrial Light & Magic). There's healthy doses of humor sprinkled throughout, with a few scenes of outright slapstick. Be forewarned; there's also a pinch of left-field weirdness (carnivorous rabbits, anyone?).  Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of The Caribbean: Curse of The Black Pearl, Rango, The Ring) continues to display his penchant for mixing in funny, often bizarre little moments that effectively work to balance out matters and give the film a creative pulse. Most of it works as there's an eventual method to the madness.  Expect the similar content and tone of 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of The Black Pearl  and 1998's The Mask Of Zorro mixed with 1990's Back To The Future Part III.  The Lone Ranger is my current pick as the overall most fun, big-budgeted Action/Adventure release of 2013.

Pay no attention to those professional critics who are laying waste to The Lone Ranger- I have a feeling most of them had their minds made up before actually seeing it.  If you're so inclined, give it a chance and check it out.  It's good old-fashioned fun that left a smile on my face.",1387497600,3,2058,4.910662824207493

I cringed every time he was on camera and was particularly annoyed by his over characterization.  If this were a kid's movie I might understand, but I'm not letting my children watch this.

5824859,4,B00DJYJWVW,"The movie is more about Tonto than the Lone Ranger, but good! Both my wife and I enjoyed it but we can see why it may have gotten some less than stellar ratings. We are both of the age to remember the Lone Ranger on radio and like most radio fans had formed fairly clear notions of what the Lone Ranger looked like and what he was all about.

The movie version of the Lone Ranger was a dramatic departure from our preconceived notions but we were able to set them aside and just watch the story unfold as presented by the movie. If you're able to do this, then you can expect a rather enjoyable ride that is filled with Johnny Depp humor; since we are both Johnny Depp fans that was not too hard for us to do.

The second half of the movie had some really funny sequences and I found myself laughing a lot as they played out. If you're expecting and require a super-hero image for the Lone Ranger you'll probably be disappointed.

5824871,1,B00DJYJWVW,"I saw the movie and was very disappointed by this movie, both the story and the graphics.  One of the greatest disappointments is the way the movie humiliates an American Icon.  In recent years, fictional characters of the past have been brought back to the screen - particularly comic book characters - and the movies that have been successful are the ones that stay true to the mythology of those characters.  It is no surprise then that ""The Lone Ranger"" movie was a bomb at the box office given how badly it denigrates the title character.

Armie Hammer plays the Lone Ranger as the script tells him to - as an adulterous, incompetent boob.  Even Silver, the Lone Ranger's horse is smarter and more competent than the Lone Ranger.

Then there is Tonto, the Lone Ranger's faithful long time friend.  Johnny Depp plays Tonto as mean, selfish, and abusive - not at all the faithful friend of legend.  Furthermore, even though the movie title is ""The Lone Ranger"" in point of fact it should be called ""Tonto and his masked friend"" because Tonto is clearly the major focus of the movie.

Then there were aspects of the story that made no sense.  For example, why have the Lone Ranger lusting after his brother's wife?  Just to show he cared for her and his brother's son later in the movie?  In another scene, the Lone Ranger's horse appears standing on the limb of a tree for no rhyme or reason and with no explanation of how he got there.  Why is Tonto in a museum display?  There were numerous scenes like that.

Finally the graphics, particularly at the end of the movie.  For a film with a budget like this one's the special effects seemed rather cheap and poorly produced.

The one thing I cannot fault is the acting.  Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer played their roles as the script told them to do.  Also, by all accounts Johnny Depp did his research into Native Americans and tried to keep his portrayal of Tonto true to their customs and for that I applaud him.

Nevertheless, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.  It was a major disappointment.  If you want to spend your money - pick up a season of the Lone Ranger starring Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels from the 1950s or one of the films they made together.",1387497600,5,2224,4.521303258145363
5824872,3,B00DJYJWVW,"First of all I normally watch a film 2 or 3 times before reviewing it here for the purpose of discovering the finer, subtler points in it that might have escaped me the first time. But this film is just SO long and a constant assault on the senses that I just really didn't feel like sitting through it a second time, and I'm relieved that I only rented it. It IS good, it's just not great. You get a BIG action pay-off right up front, then a bloated and detailed plot/story/exposition middle, then at the end -- maybe as long as 30 mins' worth -- some of the most explosive, waaaaaay over-the-top, acrobatic-stunt action scenes I've ever seen. It's relentless. But still, it's just too long. I got to the 2-hour point and had to restrain myself from FFWDing it just to finally find out how it actually ends. There are huge chunks of it that could have been easily done away with completely, or at least cut way down; ie, Helena Bonham Carter.

I knew ahead of time that it would be like ""Pirates of the Mojave Desert"" so I sat down expecting a parody of all sorts of historical/geographical/cultural elements. Like ""Pirates,"" it's heavy on the comedy, funny lines and wordplay, some slapstick, some situational. It's almost like a live-action cartoon. Johnny Depp, of course, is the primary reason to watch this, though Armie Hammer is a super-adorable guy and a pleasantly amusing comic actor who has a great career ahead of him. Johnny Depp, in spite of his leading-man looks, is at his best playing wacky, comic, character parts like this one and he plays Cap'n Tonto as cleverly as he played Cap'n Jack. The film is about half ""character"" parts and half ""straight"" characters and each are played to their perfect extreme. You can't fault the film on its cast; it's a terrific lineup of talented actors. There is some gore, which was kind of unexpected in a Disney film; parents will have to decide about their under-13 children's sensitivity to such content individually.

As in too many movies, the ""Extras"" parts on the DVD -- the outtakes and behind the scenes parts -- are actually more entertaining than the actual movie.",1387497600,,2131,4.649867374005305

The movie was really funny and had lots of great action through out.  Either I just don't have enough fond memories of Lone Ranger from my childhood to care about the new take on the material or the reviewers are just becoming way too jaded and expecting way too much these days.

5824881,4,B00DJYJWVW,"I enjoyed this movie as it was well done and had some comical moments. Really a great modern day western made to look authentic and they pulled it off. The acting was good all around and I really liked Johnny Depps character Tonto. Being from Arizona I really enjoyed the beautiful filming locations, especially around the Grand Canyon and Monument Valley. The movie was quite entertaining as are the extras on the Blu-Ray disc. The DVD only has bloopers on it. I would not recommend this movie for small kids as there is some killing with guns in the beginning. One part of the movie that cracked me up and was so cool was Tonto climbing up the ladder, I never expected that and was LOL. A lot of great action scenes in this movie that kept the flow going.

(small spoiler) My only gripe about the movie is the many missed opportunities to kill the bad guys, they really dragged this out. This was the only foundation I could find for any negative reviews. Also I wished they had filmed it in full screen instead of the wide screen using the black bars across the top and bottom. One more gripe with Disney, they printed a basic grey and blue paint on the discs themselves, instead of nice print art like the cover. LAME. Looks like a Netflix rental. For that these discs will be going to ebay instead of in my blu-ray portfolio case.

Still I feel I got my money's worth from this movie as it was good entertainment.",1387411200,,1418,4.408396946564886

The movie was funny, whimsical and entertaining. I laughed more watching this than I have in straight up comedies. For the characters they were to portray, Armie H (Lone Ranger) and Johnny D (Tonto) did an excellent job and that was a huge selling point of the movie as to how they interacted with one another. Both appeared meant for one another yet, neither of them would admit it.

The story and plot were very well written and carried out through most of the movie although, there were some humdrum parts and the movie could have been just a tad shorter. Hence, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. The setting/environment was excellent.

It has everything you would want in an exciting western film.  As far as the actors go, Armie Hammer was adequate as the Lone Ranger.  Another actor might have been better.  But he was OK.  Johnny Depp was enjoyable as a rather bizarre Tonto.  The rest of the cast was enjoyable as well.  The film was a bit graphic and violent, but it was not over-the-top violent.

5824893,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Walt Disney Home Entertainment brings ""The Lone Ranger"" into your living room on Blu-ray, DVD, and as a Digital Download. This is the perfect opportunity for more people to give it the chance they didn't when it hit theaters. The film is as authentic a western as audiences can get these days. It's an action-packed ride filled with humor and plenty of thrills.

John Reid rides along with his Texas Ranger brother to track down a ruthless bandit. After the group of lawmen is killed in an ambush, Reid is left for dead. Native American Tonto finds the injured Reid and nurses him back to health. It's now left up to the unlikely union of these two very different men to track down the killer of Reid's brother and bring him to justice.

""The Lone Ranger"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (2:40.1). The video quality is up to the standards we expect from Disney. The picture is clean and the colors are all well-balanced. Much of the movie is filmed on location which lends to its authentic feel and viewing experience.

The 7.1 surround sound mix for ""The Lone Ranger"" puts the viewer right in the middle of all the adventure and excitement. ""William Tell's Overture"" never sounded so bombastic while accompanying all the gunfire, galloping, and explosions we are awarded in this fun-filled journey into yesteryear. Hans Zimmer's musical score perfectly accentuates all the frenetic and dramatic activity taking place on the screen.

The Blu-ray version of ""The Lone Ranger"" contains a few special features. They include three featurettes entitled ""Riding the Trails of 'The Lone Ranger',"" ""Armie's Western Road Trip,"" and ""Becoming a Cowboy."" It also features a deleted scene and bloopers.

""The Lone Ranger"" isn't a perfect film by any means. Some of the action sequences are a bit long for one. I found Johnny Depp's performance as Tonto to be a lot of fun to watch, but some might feel he's going back to the Captain Jack Sparrow well one too many times. Overall, it's a rollicking good time that hearkens back to the days of cliffhanging matinees of the 1930s and 1940s.",1387411200,,2092,4.832402234636872

So I've lived with WT overture streaming from the AM radio, thrilling me. This film was funny as expected with Johnny Depp, and Jerry Brukheimer's super action influence on director Vervinski. I didn't view this in the theater, so these are purely my opinions based on this BD product.

 The only thing I wish to point out, despite some reviews to the contrary, almost all of the elements of the Lone Ranger, were included, however subtle, and sometimes in a quick snippet or a word or two. Bruckheimer apparently had a skilled historian of, maybe, himself.

Additionally, this Blu-ray presentation had exceptional Dolby 7.1 sound with bullets zinging all around the room and the ""William Tell"" overture scored to the action. The Film was crystal clear on my 80-inch Sharp TV. Maybe part of it was that this was shot with film instead of digital.

I also noticed that unlike most period pieces, the trains were accurate replicas of the original trains. The only serious error was the artistic license taken to have an operating scale train on a table with a controller of some sort, which didn't exist until just before WWII.

Just finished watching this, and it's great! I think I'm done with critics. Now that Roger Ebert has passed away, I suppose there just is no one left to trust in that profession. So, on point ...

(1) this was a loving and amusing interpretation of an American treasure, reimagined finally with a new perspective on Native Americans. I thought Depp's contribution, as no surprise, superb.

(2) was this over the top? Well, sure, but not really until the last 30 minutes or so ... then it was ridiculously over the top ... but, who cares? This was a fantasy, a mythic adaptation. And the last bit a rather rollicking, fun ride!

5824906,4,B00DJYJWVW,"With two kids under five and a baby on the way, I don't get out much to say the least! Movies are a thing of my past and I have to wait for things to come out on Blu-Ray/DVD to watch them. As a huge Johnny Depp fan I have been anxiously awaiting the release of The Lone Ranger and it's finally here!

I have to say, both my husband and I were a bit disappointed. I guess I expect a lot from any movie Johnny Depp is in so my standards may be slightly higher for any movie he's in. That being said, I can't put my finger specifically on what I didn't like. It just seemed like the chemistry between the characters, specifically Depp and Hammer, was just off. It's like their humor didn't play off each other in the way I'd expect.

Depp is always genius with his expressions and body language and there is no one that can touch him in that department. But it's not a stand alone character movie and so when he doesn't mesh well with the other main characters, it just doesn't work.

The movie seemed a bit slow at times but made up for it with incredible action sequences that had me on the edge of my seat. I liked the overall story and didn't expect it to be exactly like the original. It was close enough but with some added Hollywood flair.

All in all The Lone Ranger was entertaining and worth watching but I did expect a little more. It'd still make a great stocking stuffer for all the Johnny Depp fans out there!",1387324800,,1420,4.152727272727272

I have been watching the summer blockbusters as they are released on DVD and the only one that comes close to being as entertaining as this was Fast & the Furious 6.

I think the storytelling is outstanding. A more somber take on the Lone Ranger may not have gone over as well. That we are actually viewing the story through the minds eye of a child as he is being told it from what appears to be a wax Tonto in an old Western museum is ingenious and lends to a very imaginative and entertaining script.",1387324800,3,746,4.253521126760563
5824909,4,B00DJYJWVW,"As what often happens, the boys/girls of the mass media miss the entire point. Putting a dress on Jesse Ventura does not transform him into Lady Gaga, any more than titling this film The Lone Ranger makes it such. Beyond using the oft repeated moniker, any similarity between this story and the Lone Ranger chronicle is casual at best and irrelevant for its purpose. The secret, therefore, is realizing that this film is NOT a platform for the Lone Ranger legend and should be judged accordingly. Any evaluative judgment of its merits and deficiencies should be made independently of its source name and weighed for what it is a stand-alone western, meandering along its own course.
  A myriad of influences provide this film with its core essence. Some of A Little Big Man, Keatons The General, and the Indiana Jones trilogy combine with a sprinkling of The Guns of Navarone and The Bridge over the River Kwai in providing us with a moderately entertaining film which often overextends its boundaries in a search for a stable horizon. While sometimes overreaching and predictable, the actors, and Johnny Depp in particular parlay a simple premise into a film that should be enjoyed and appreciated for what others often portray as lacking. Not to be ever confused with a classic within the genre, it nonetheless clearly meets its goal of providing a fun story to be enjoyed and appreciated on its own terms and merits. Its definitely worth a watch.  Ken Fogelman",1387324800,3,1463,4.867469879518072

5824912,5,B00DJYJWVW,"This is an awesome movie.

Yes, it is long and yes, it's very similar ""Pirates of the Caribbean""  in a western setting with cowboys and Indians instead of pirates and ocean.

And I do not mean this in a bad way.  It has action, and very humorous, deadpan scenes that one comes to expect out of Johnny Depp. His take on Tonto does remind a bit of the tipsy pirate but who knows, maybe he is one of Jack's ancestors. (Why not, The Mad Hatter seemed to be Willy Wonka's orange haired second cousin.) But again this is not necessarily a bad thing, as fans of Jack will find his Tonto to be an old kemosabe.

They are NOT the same of course...the character has his own unique quirks as well.

But this is not your father's Lone Ranger.  There is a masked man, a cowboy and an Indian with the names Tonto and Lone Ranger, and some horses but that's where the similarities end.

It is a movie, meant to be enjoyed and entertain for a few hours, and it does this.  It is a very enjoyable film despite what the critics say.

Now I want to say a few words about peoples' opinion of Tonto.  Those who claim that it is wrong of Johnny Depp to play an Indian, unfortunately aren't aware of the fact that he's more Cherokee than white.  He was well received and was dubbed an honorary Commanche and had the blessing of many of the tribes.  The film's proceeds helped many Native American children receive a quality education that they wouldn't have otherwise gotten.  This movie deserves ten stars for that principle.

Johnny has played a Native American before.  (In the film he co-wrote, directed and starred in, ""The Brave"".  Unfortunately very few people have been fortunate enough to have seen it.)  With that said, the critics who like to nitpick about that have missed the whole point entirely.  This is a fun movie,and  it's very funny.  While a few scenes are tedious and drawn out, they aren't awful.

Die hard Johnny Depp fans will of course want to add this one to their collection.  Since it was shot on location in several western and southwestern states, the scenery is breathtaking and beautiful, especially in high definition. It is a film that sadly didn't do as well in theaters as it could have, simply because critics and reviewers had their minds made up to dislike it before they got a chance to even see it.  (A few recanted after they saw it.) They were determined to hurt this film before it got out of the starting gate.  It is a highly misjudged film.

Just get a snack and sit back and enjoy it. We're in the midst of the holiday season, along with nasty winter weather and it is an excellent diversion for a cold day.",1387324800,6,2633,4.410788381742739

However, THE LONE RANGER is also a beautifully shot, rip-roaring Western adventure/buddy action pic with some great set pieces and - most surprisingly for a 'popcorn' flick - some serious things to say about how America's manifest destiny wiped out an entire race of people.

Yes, the movie is a little too long (mostly because of its action scenes) and a little disjointed (the female characters not only have nothing to do here, they're actually not all that relevant to the story), but THE LONE RANGER doesn't deserve the reputation that it's gotten, and deserves a second look (or a first look for many of you!) now that it's on home video.

5824922,2,B00DJYJWVW,"Sometimes I like movies that are largely considered to be stink bombs. John Carter: flawed but not as bad as many said. Santa Claus the Movie: far from perfect, but wonderful in many ways, especially the storybook quality and Henry Mancini's score. Lost Horizon: misfires aplenty but a fine cast, kitsch value and some catchy tunes by Bacharach/David. And so on.

So I tried to find something to like in The Lone Ranger. The opening, with the boy at the carnival (and the ""thrilling days of yesteryear"" reference to the radio show) was encouraging. But it just never picks up. Much as I tried, how do I not love thee, Lone Ranger 2013? Let me count the ways...

1. Uneven balance of drama, comedy, send-up, fantasy, sick humor, bawdiness and western melodrama. This could be the first Disney film in which someone is seen peeing on camera. Not long after, another character vomits. Then Silver (as in Hi-Yo) poops and The Lone Ranger himself is dragged through it, head first.

2. The lead character is an idiot. It's as if Jeannie blinked Major Nelson into a very expensive episode of I Dream of Jeannie. The difference is that even Larry Hagman would have played it less silly.

3. Like John Carter, they hung a multi-million-dollar movie on the shoulders of an untested lead actor. It took two Armie Hammers to make a Winklevoss. Perhaps he can redeem his lead status in a future vehicle. Taylor Kitsch is now a supporting actor.

4. Johnny Depp. Plenty has been said about his performance, but I wonder whether the whole concept couldn't work no matter what he did. His Tonto is very much like Jack Sparrow, only his voice sounds like Rob Schneider in Bedtime Stories.

5. Sweaty, yucky, grizzled, bulbous, bloated, scuzzy people, all except for Armie Hammer, followed by the angry-eyes lady who plays the unhappy mom of P.L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks.

6. Never release a movie in the heat of summer and show a lot of overdressed people who look like they're either in need of a bath or about to pass out, as well as people who look like they need to be hosed down. Another John Carter mistake.

7. Way too much money spent. (SPOILER) As soon as I saw the bridge -- a REALLY big bridge, I knew it would get blowed up real good and come tumbling down. Gene Autry could have made 30 episodes of his TV show,  four movies, six radio shows and a record album in the time it takes to watch this movie. Surely there's a point in the middle.

8. Way too long. An issue with a lot of movies nowadays, though.

9. This is the first time I've ever seen bloopers that mostly could have been in left in the movie without it making much of a difference. Not being facetious.

10. Cannibal bunnies.

Good points: Johnny Depp's performance as the old version of Tonto is the closest any character comes to being sympathetic (though he looks like Dustin Hoffman in Little Big Man or Billy Crystal in Mr. Saturday Night). Breathtaking photography. Armie has nice hair when it hasn't been dragged through horse poop. Lather, rinse, repeat.

Is it worth seeing? Well, I couldn't turn away. There's something compelling and astonishing about a work of this magnitude gone astray. My wife, who loves to see a good western, would still like to see a good western.

Clearly this film was intended to do for westerns what Pirates of the Caribbean did for pirate movies. As a genre, they're still too problematic in this day and age to work. And this film's very visible lack of success doesn't bode well for another attempt of this nature to happen anytime soon.",1387238400,3,3545,4.587025316455696

The Lone Ranger is a masterpiece and Depp seems to have brought along many elements from that film to this one. I loved the Lone Ranger. It's five stars ALL the way. I viewed it on Direct TV. I wish I had bought the disc. I guess that I will. Five stars is not enough. Dead Man is also a masterpiece. You will recognize it after the Lone Ranger. It's more serious. I also recommend Heaven's Gate for a thoroughly serious examination of yet more things for Americans to be ashamed of. All three of these movies have a character in common... the railroad, trains. Pretty good stuff for those who like rails. Lone Ranger is a wonderful gift to those of us who absorbed the radio program. If you like stories of the west... these three are great. There are such horrid bad guys in the Lone Ranger... I'm not sure what age is okay. I guess maybe at age 12 it's time to learn some ugly truth if you have not started already. Kids must know a lot of horror worse than this after all. Wait until it's time to learn about the Nazis. All three movies I recommend could remind you of ""Deadwood"" too.

monotone voice throughout this 149 min movie.  Armie Hammer as the awkward Lone Ranger has not much to do other than
falling or riding his Silver.  The supporting cast consists of character actors with familiar faces, still recognizable under heavy make ups, mostly wasted by the listless script written by 3 scriptwriters, the standard writing by committee for blockbusters.  It is too much for Gore Verbinski, normally a dependable director of entertaining films to make it into a worthwhile film.

5824943,3,B00DJYJWVW,"Please allow me to disclaim:  I have not ordered this from Amazon (yet), but I did see the movie in the theatre.

This movie, I feel, was a bit harshly reviewed.  I felt like it delivered on most fronts.  The script was great, the soundtrack was strong, the action sequences were well presented, the casting, with one exception, was great, and the acting, again, with one exception, was great.  Johnny Depp, as most assumed that he would, stole the show, and the movie was better for it.  But, Armie Hammer, in my opinion, was miscast, and really did fumble this role.  He made an honest attempt to play the role but didn't have the comedic ""chops"" to pull off the portrayal of the character that I think that he was shooting for.  Also, he really didn't do much justice to the character himself, rather, playing him moreso as a parody of the character.  It was almost as if he were, essentially, trapped in an acting purgatory, if you will, because he is neither a comedic actor, nor a strong action star.

I'm not saying that he's a bad actor, and there are plenty of films that I'm sure that he would be just fine in, but he just didn't strike me as right for this role, and his portrayal of the character really hurt the entire film at the end of the day.

Johnny Depp's performance as Tonto was actually the film's saving grace.

There is fun to be had watching this film, and since I really do think that Gore Verbinski makes great films, I have to say that there was a great movie there.  They just had the wrong actor in the title role, and his struggles in that role brought the whole film down a little bit.

5824947,1,B00DJYJWVW,"While I wasn't expecting a big screen version of the TV show I loved in the 1950s, I was hoping for some of its magic. Admittedly magic more accessible to a child, but a semblance is not a lot to ask. If a simple black and white television show filmed on a modest budget could manage, why not a 150 million dollar attempt with state of the arts special effects?
I can see why critics went after the film for being all over the place. One has to ask who the target audience was? Given the implied violence, it couldn't be children although the rating would indicate otherwise. The script stayed faithful for the most part to the legend of the Lone Ranger and Tonto, I didn't mind their back stories. Having said that, the pacing was glacial in the first act. Comedy and drama often work together, but in this instance the comedic aspects just served to undermine the main characters, especially Silver.
What the film lacked more than any thing else was mystery, everyone seemed to know who the Lone Ranger was. The mystique of the Lone Ranger was pretty much non existent. His mask was more of a joke to people than a symbol of justice or intimidation. He was basically Clark Kent on a horse, a guy in a lawyer's suit who meant well and happened to be wearing a mask (and that awful hat).
The movie was a misfire. Too bad, it had the look of the great Sergio Leone westerns but not nearly as rich in attitude or ambiance. Leone's vision of the West was mythic. Gore Verbinski's is slapstick.",1386460800,10,1490,4.4021739130434785
5824948,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I grew up on the original Lone Ranger series and growing up with this, I was very excited to see what Disney would do for it, as well as see what Johnny Depp would do as Tonto. Going into the movie I had some understanding of the original series, but I had none of the back story of how the Lone Ranger came to be. This movie did a great job in my opinion at setting the tone and the back story of this character and his sidekick. The movie itself was well made and had a ton of action and adventure. On top of this the plot was fast paced and I found myself at the edge of my seat from beginning to end. In the end, get ready to be entertained and to enjoy yourself throughout the entire movie!

First off see the movie for yourself. Second Leave out the critics and make your own personal decision about it. I care nothing for critics as they are full of themselves and really make no determination as to whether I or you would enjoy a movie any more or less than they did.

I don't know how to counter the others....it is not racist (the original lone ranger was racist), it is not shallow (although the original lone ranger was that too).  If the old lone ranger was as fun as masturbation, this movie is as fun as sex!  In 2012, Disney gave us one the best movies ever made, John Carter....it was called a terrible flop.

5824954,1,B00DJYJWVW,"I remember watching the Lone Ranger as a kid, trying hard not to miss an episode and enjoying every one of the stories. The masked hero and his sidekick Tonto were a beloved pair in our household. So when I saw this movie came out, I was looking forward to see the duo in action again. Ohhh, the disappointment!

I think the creators of this film could have done little to make this a worse experience for me. The characters are far from what I remembered. Th way the story is told makes no sense, with an ancient Tonto in a museum coming to life and narrating it to a kid dressed as the Lone Ranger. The narration shows characters that act way out of what we would expect, and does not really work to make the story interesting.

One of the main problems is that the story is really dull. I ended up having to watch it in chunks because I could not stand sitting down to watch this and being bored out of my mind. They tried to incorporate quite a bit of humor, all of which falls flat on its face. I would have thought that having Johnny Depp would have made humor work, but it is truly not the case. The action scenes are so over the top ridiculous that even though there is a lot of stuff going on, I lost interest pretty quickly.

Overall watching this movie was a dreadful experience, I would not even recommend it to my worst enemies, because it would be cruel and unusual punishment.",1384732800,9,1391,4.241509433962264

5824956,1,B00DJYJWVW,"In the early and middle parts of the 20th Century, it was a common practice to use white men to portray Native Americans in the movies.  I thought Kevin Costner's movie ""Dances With Wolves"" changed that practice.  I was wrong.  Disney claimed that using Johnny Depp as Tonto offered the best chance for financial success.  Of course they were wrong.  They forgot that a good script was the foundation for a successful movie.  Their attitude that a real Native American would limit their revenue was simply put: Racism - pure and simple!  I used to subscribe to a Native American magazine that tried to justify the Johnny Depp-as-Tonto decision.  They asserted that a movie providing Native American actors ""work"" was better than no movie at all.  Damn poor excuse for racism in the 21st century.  I went to the see this movie on the big screen in hope that it may have some social redeeming value and/or a bit of real Native American history.  Growing up in the 50s watching the Lone Ranger & Tonto on the small screen, I was hoping for best.

Like movies in the 20th century it portrayed Native Americans as both brave and stupid.  The scene showing the Native Americans charging into horrific gatlin gun fire reminded me of real-life atrocities such  as the Wounded Knee and Sand Creek massacres.  That scene in this plot-thin (western version of Pirates of the Caribbean) movie served absolutely no purpose except, maybe, providing work for Native American actors.  Being a Johnny Depp fan but the son of a reservation-born Native American, I couldn't have been more disappointed in this movie.  Pray with me that no sequels come of this racism.  Pray that Disney will offer Native Americans more meaningful means of employment.",1384300800,6,1731,4.829931972789115

5824964,5,B00DJYJWVW,"At the end of The Lone Ranger, a sizable portion of a largely appreciative audience stayed to view the credits of this much maligned bit of summer fun. I was not surprised. From the first moments of the film, the audience clearly was enjoying it- a lot. No restlessness, but lots of laughter, enthusiastic comments, and the sense that the film had the audience's complete attention immediately neutralized the critics negative buzz. As people left the theater they talked about how wrong the critics were and more than a few, including me, planned to see it again. In the days that followed my friends and I kept quoting lines from it- mostly from Tonto.

Ten years ago, director Gore Verbinski and star Johnny Depp created one of the all-time best summer blockbusters, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."" It was funny, slick, bright, brisk, lighthearted and exciting  much like the Lone Ranger.

""The Lone Ranger,"" is a bit of romantic western lore about a masked cowboy hero and his faithful Indian companion who was created in 1933 for radio and has since appeared on TV, movie serials, in juvenile boys' novels and in comic books. This Lone Ranger does not stray far from its origins. In fact, I was struck by how close the screenplay for the film stuck to that of the radio serial.

The plot-heavy story involves a murderous silver thief (William Fichtner) with a scarred ""Jonah Hex""-like face, an evil corporate railroad man (Tom Wilkinson), a romance with a young widow (Ruth Wilson) plus revenge and destiny.

Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger is chiseled, handsome and heroic, but a doofus who does not understand the nature of life in this very wild West. He has very few of the skills needed to be a hero. His brother has them, but his death (along with most of his posse) is the starting point of the Lone Rangers halting journey into heroism. Tonto (Johnny Depp) has been searching for a partner and thought he found one in the great warrior who is now dead. He gets stuck with his inept younger brother who he calls Ke-mo sah-bee (which might mean either trusted friend or wrong brother or both). The name Tonto also has more than one translation, wild one or fool or both.

What is unique about this version of the Lone Ranger story is that it is Tontos story. He is its principal character, its narrator, and its guardian. The story is told by him in his old age to a young boy dressed as the Lone Ranger at a Wild West Show. Depp conjures up a sympathetic Tonto, the guru for the Lone Ranger, with face paint and a bird headdress based on a Native American painting called ""I Am Crow."" His deadpan delivery of almost all of the best  lines in the film works very well and yet the other characters remain memorable.

Depp creates a real inner world for the kooky, mystical character, anchored in an all too likely atrocity against his people when he was a child. That atrocity is mirrored later in the film when members of his tribe take on gatling guns.
The agent who transforms Tonto and the Ranger into an effective team (and seemingly imbues the hapless Ranger with a whole new set of skills essential for a hero) is the Spirit Horse who chooses the Ranger and is every bit as crazy as Tonto. The horse? Silver, of course.

It's all here: ""William Tell Overture"" theme music, beautifully photographed canyons, and a couple of exhilarating chase and fight sequences (just enough really given the tendency of summer films to over-indulge in madcap, often senseless action).

In the last moments of the film, the nave attorney reborn as the masked hero proclaims Hi-Yo, Silver!  Away,"" as he rears up his horse waving his hat in the iconic greeting from the TV show. He looks quite silly in doing so Tonto tells him, ""Don't ever do that again."" A great punch line. I hope it is not a prophetic one. But given how the film was butchered by reviewers coast to coast and its under-performance at the box office, I fear that the Ranger and Tonto may not be riding again.",1383436800,15,4003,4.584615384615384
5824965,2,B00DJYJWVW,"I love westerns.  Serious westerns like The Searchers or True Grit, and fun westerns like Silverado or McLintock, so I was hopeful for a new version of The Lone Ranger because it could be done either way and still be good.  Unfortunately Gore Verbinski (of Pirates of the Caribbean fame) achieves neither.  I'm just gonna come out and tell you what is wrong with this movie.  The hero is a buffoon.  You can't get behind a guy who won't listen to anyone and just does the opposite of what a hero should do.  Don't get me wrong a good protagonist should be flawed, but Armie Hammer's John Reid (The Lone Ranger) is kind of a dipstick.  The idea, I'm sure, was to see the character grow from greenhorn to hero ala The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, but that never really happens until the last big scene when he just ""gets it"", sort of.  A lot of attention has been placed on Johnny Depp's Tonto and yes his character is sort of an oddball, even for an Indian, but that is actually explained in the story so I really had little issue with his idiosyncracies.  There was a problem with the film involving Tonto though.  The idea is that a veeeeery old Tonto is telling the story to a young boy in 1933 but this was done far better in Little Big Man.  If you don't already know the origin of the Lone Ranger he, along with his father and brother, were Texas Rangers, in this film it's just his brother no father, and they are ambushed in a canyon and left for dead.  Tonto comes along and finds John Reid to be the only survivor, nurses him to health and becomes his partner in the fight against injustice in the west.  That's basically what happens in this movie but it takes 40 minutes to get there.  A lot of this movie feels like filler.  The running time is 2hrs 30 minutes and if you took out the old Tonto stuff and trimmed a bit more superfluous stuff you'd be left with a fairly tight 1hr 40min movie.  You'd still need a rewrite because your main character isn't that likable but it would be better.  I know Verbingski's got a good western movie in him because the animated film Rango was basically a western with animal characters and it plays really well on that level.  So yes I was disappointed, but the main reason I'm so disappointed is that ""Hollywood"" and the average movie goer will think it's because The Lone Ranger is a western it's not good.  So we won't be seeing any new western films in the multiplex for a good long while.  Sigh.  The genre is ready for a comeback but we need quality product to shake up the market (I'm talking to you Coen Brothers).",1383436800,2,2573,4.329853862212944
5824966,5,B00DJYJWVW,"My opinion? Better than Pirates (I grew up with Pirates, the ride and movies), best Western in years, fun, suspenseful, great acting, music, and everything else that makes a movie great.

I saw it in theatres twice. The end when they play the William Tell Overture gave me a surge of excitement and I even feel it just thinking about it.

Apparently people are mostly complaining about bad writing or not staying true to the original. I'll admit, I never watched or listened to the original. But that's not the point. Movies are made in their own time. If it were going to be the same as the old one, might as well watch the old one.

The original story was made for then. This is an interpretation, a reinvention, for now and today's audience and it pulls together nicely.

It sounds to me that people had the wrong expectations or couldn't follow it for some reason (I couldn't really see what would be confusing. Maybe the mixed chronological telling? I don't know.)

I grew up with The Lone Ranger, actually shook hands with Silver at a rodeo, and it was my favorite TV show at the time.  We watched at a neighbors house who had the only TV in the neighborhood and therefore was stuck with 5 or 6 neighborhood kids every Thursday night at 7:30.  Anyhow, the flick was a lot like the Mad Magazine version in the old comic book edition.  The parody was right on and dealt with every Lone Ranger icon with a Mad Magazine eye.  The film is rousing, very funny, and full of action (boredom really isn't an option).  The special effects seem much more believable than most of the Computer generated crap in most Summer Blockbusters.  It seems more like the old days when stuntmen were doing the stunts instead of computer nerds.  Anyhow, if you are truly a fan of the old TV show and have a sense of humor, you should love this as I did. Clayton Moore would love it.  Does everything have to be politically correct, who cares if Johnny Depp is not an Indian, that's actually the point isn't it, and a lot of the initial attraction.  I got hot for this flick minute I heard Johnny Depp was playing Tonto, the idea is so preposterous.

It's a huge departure from the Tonto of yesteryear, but there's no denying the way his character keeps the movie flowing smoothing and entertaining throughout.

I was amazed to find out that many of the stunts in this movie are real, which is why the production costs were so high. While there's plenty of parts that are obvious special effects, there's plenty in this movie that leave you thinking the stunt folks were underpaid.

Sure it had a few light-hearted, goofy parts.  However, the story that that was told was quite serious, yet without taking itself too seriously.  The Lone Ranger was everything that a moviegoer could want in a summer film and you walk out with this feeling that it was not at all a waste of time and money.  If people are looking for a thought-provoking, deep, philosophical and metaphysical film, then maybe you should watch ""Cloud Atlas"" instead.  ""The Lone Ranger"" is not that type of film and wasn't intended to be.  Just give it a chance and enjoy it for what it is-- a fun-filled summer movie that will take you back to the good ol' days of the 70's, 80's and 90's when great, enjoyable movies were cranked out all the time.  I stopped listening to the critics years ago and their latest bashing of this awesome film has been even further inspiration for me to continue to not listen to them.",1380758400,40,1416,4.553359683794467
5824991,5,B00DJYJWVW,"The Lone Ranger, directed by Gore Verbinski, is a re-boot of the old TV series about John Reid, a ""city-man"" moving back to his home town where his brother is Sherriff. But when John, his brother and four other Texas Rangers are gunned down by Butch Cavendish and his gang, John comes back to life as a spirit walker: ""one who has been to the other side."" Now, teamed up with the Native American Tonto, Reid dons a mask and becomes The Lone Ranger, to stop Butch Cavendish and avenge his brother. But as their quest for justice uncovers a conspiracy that spans across the United States, danger lurks around every corner.

The Lone Ranger, through my eyes, is what the 4th Pirates movie should have been. I won't go into the mistake that was that Pirates installment, but I will express my love and gratitude for this absolutely awesome movie. Johnny Depp is actually incredibly fantastic as Tonto, being both undeniably weird, and seriously broken. During the really dramatic, emotional scenes, you could tell Tonto was honestly a broken man, haunted by his past that had clouded his beliefs and knowledge. Armie Hammer was good as John Reid, but it was his performance that partially made this movie more fun than truly epic and incredible. Reid here is extremely goofy and Disney-esque, being a practical joke of sorts before dying and coming back. William Fichtner was haunting and disturbing as Cavendish, who is believed by Tonto to be a ""wendigo,"" an evil creature that feeds on the hearts of men (which he literally does in the movie). Gore's directing is very good, having an At World's End-feeling, but in the Old West. The cinematography was superb and award-worthy, and if it isn't nominated for at LEAST two Oscars, well, then there is no hope for the award ceremonies from here on out. Hans Zimmer's musical score is grand and epic, capturing the scope, scale and emotion perfectly, especially the rehashed and expanded William Tell Overture, which is infinitely better here. The visual effects are top-notch too, but there isn't much to begin with, so there's that.

Overall, The Lone Ranger is not a classic, is far from perfect, but is a must-see and must-own for anyone who likes action/adventure, Disney, goofy comedy and westerns. I'm just so ashamed and disappointed in the film community, because this movie deserved a bigger audience. But then again, so did John Carter (bad marketing, there).

5824992,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Long before ""The Lone Ranger"" hit the big screens in July, 2013 I was getting ready for my nineteenth road trip to New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado in August. As a young child growing up on a Scottish Housing Estate on the outskirts of Edinburgh in the late 1950's I remember watching the original black and whites on television. The Lone Ranger was a cool dude but more than a bit weird with the super clean outfit, white hat and black eye mask. As for Tonto he was also super clean, neat and tidy with the dorky thin leather strap tied around his forehead. The bad guys must have been frequently stunned when confronted by ""THE OMO BROTHERS."" Not wishing to seem a touch cynical I have over thirty-two years travelling the Great Plains of the United States of America with 200,000 miles clocked up on my trusty rental vehicles. Finding the truth about the real Wild West has been my passion and sadly it does not tally one little bit with Hollywood's version in the 1950's and 1960's. To skip quickly forward to my feelings about the new movie I went along not caring about the cynical early American reviews and hoping to enjoy a good acting performance by Mr. Depp and his supporting cast. To say that I enjoyed the movie was a understatement of the highest order!!! Everything came together for me, the acting, the script, the cinematography and finally the Hans Zimmer musical score. During the next few weeks the critics in the United States of America continued to vent their anger at the movie citing that it was not like the original concept with Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels. Was the modern Flash Gordon movie anything like the original 1950's black and white versions. NO! NO! NO!  Prior to my working road trip to the Great Plains in early August I supported the movie ten more times and enjoyed each visit. There was always something new and exciting happening that I had not seen and digested during the previous screening. Friends laughed out loud when I said it is the Lone Ranger time of day! The movie was pure entertainment and I loved the crazyiness of Johnny Depp performing his updated slant on ""Tonto."" I loved the performance by Armie Hammer and the give and take attitude of both these freedom fighters for justice in the recent Wild West. And to my joy I thought the clothing and regalia on both men was right on the money. Plus more that a little dirt thrown in for good luck! The supporting cast were excellent in their parts weaving the captivating storyline together, Tom Wilkinson, William Fichtner, Ruth Wilson from ""Luther"" fame, Helena Bonham Carter, James Badge Dale, Barry Pepper, Saginaw Grant, and my two favourite supporting cast members bad guy Harry Treadaway and the young child gunslinger at the Wild West Fairground Mason Cook. Three weeks ago I arrived back from the Southern Great Plains and I enjoyed my treks with Navajo Guides in Canyon de Chelly and Monument Valley. Our guide Leander Staley who worked on the movie parts filmed in Canyon de Chelly was full of interesting behind the scene stories that make the hard trek up the rugged canyon floor interesting to say the least. Bajan Bazelli's use of camera angles in both Monument Valley and Canyon de Chelly was spot on and he managed to capture the power, spirit and soul of both these majestic areas on the southern plains. I was pleased to find that Disney had the vision to record the making of the movie and the hardback book ""The Lone Ranger Behind The Mask: On The Trail Of A Outlaw Epic by Michael Singer has interesting visual artworks and imagery plus excellent stories about the making of the film. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer commented in the press after the film had completed its American commitment in general release that the movie would become a cult classic in a decades time. The movie did poorly in the states but worldwide it found a better reception and with the China release in early October the film to-date has grossed 245 million dollars. With over 700,000 likes on its Facebook page I am sure the movie has lots of legs left in disc, streaming and television to pay back its bills. The trick when creating art is to present the creative works and let the observer work out the pros and cons at a later date. During many of my visits to The Lone Ranger I found myself laughing out loud days after a screening. That is when one really knows they have hit gold in the movie entertainment arena!!!",1380499200,13,4435,4.628172588832487

5824999,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I saw The Lone Ranger for the first time on July 19 (numerous times since then), and came out of the theater in a daze.  It was one of the best movies I had ever seen.  Others who have written the four- and five-star reviews have brought up all that they had seen in this movie that the critics and fan boys missed.  Part of the reason the film did not do well was the marketing to the wrong audience.  It turns out that many of the fans of this movie are women over the age of 30 who are uninterested in comic book superheroes and special effects.
What did I love about The Lone Ranger?
1.  It had a long and comprehensive but cohesive and intense storyline.  You have to pay attention!  Everything that was talked about in the first half is brought up again in the second half.
2.  Likeable, empathetic characters.  After a few viewings, you even start to feel a little sympathy for Butch.
3.  The humans are real, the sets are real, the scenery is real, the trains are real and the stunts are real.  The runaway train sequence has to be the best one ever filmed.
4.  The sight gags, anachronisms and one-liners are laugh-out-loud funny.
5.  There is a sweet little unrequited love story.
6.  The soundtrack is beautiful, with what may be the most exciting William Tell Overture ever recorded.
7.  There is a slight touch of fantasy, with the wendigo/werewolves hints, the time travel hints, Tonto's belief that John has some magical powers and the entire ""Nature is indeed out of balance"" subplot.
8.  What IS in the film: 1950s charm and heart, 1960s ""bigness,"" 1970s melancholy and 1980s bright colors.
9.  What wasn't in the film, and what I DID NOT miss:  lots of CGI, pop culture references, cursing, sarcasm and cynicism and irony, and all unlikeable characters.
Unfortunately, the financial woes of this movie combined with the public disdain for an older storyline mixed with 21st Century sly, wicked humor ensure that an old-fashioned Cecil B. DeMille on-location epic will never be made again.",1379721600,8,2006,4.602816901408451
5825000,4,B00DJYJWVW,"I remember watching reruns of the Lone Ranger every Sunday morning on TV when I was a kid. It was great fun at the time but now in retrospect it is pretty campy... that's not necessarily a bad thing mind you but I have wondered what a modern interpretation of these classic characters would be like. I was looking forward to seeing the movie until I saw all the bad reviews. I waited until the movie was clearly running out of cinema steam before I dragged my daughter to go see it with me. I was skeptical because according to the so-called ""professional critics"" (what a joke), the  studio had really screwed the pooch. Wow. Nope. What a fun movie! The characters are great, the story is solid, the acting is pretty on point, and some of the action is borderline ridiculous (in a good way).. especially the ending Indiana Jones-esque action sequence which is wonderfully silhouetted by the always energetic William Tell Overture. There are a few flies in the ointment however, the movie does drag in a couple of places and it feels like a couple of the scenes were tacked on but I think these are pretty minor quibbles when you consider this movie as a whole. So the problem with critics these days I think may have more to do with how they perceive film as art. I think film being regarded as art is absurd anyway, it is entertainment for commercial enrichment. Art speaks to different people in different ways, a movie tells you exactly how it is suppose to be interpreted so trying to hold an action movie to some snobby artistic standard is utter rubbish and I think the critical reaction of this films illustrates this point well. Art is enjoyed timelessly, but a film.. well, about 2 hours. Just because an action film does not rise to the level of Matisse in some people's eyes, doesn't mean it isn't successful in it's own genre where this particular action movie does quite well.",1379203200,12,1890,4.5588235294117645
5825001,5,B00DJYJWVW,"This is really my second review, but I couldn't revise the original because I did it on my daughter's computer. My kids probably think I'm mad, but I've bought the poster and a Lone Ranger cover for my cell phone. It truly is a wonderful movie and for people my age (69) it will bring tears to your eyes when The William Tell Overture begins in what has to be the best climax scene in movie history. Armie Hammer on Silver galloping down the top of a train will never be surpassed. I know, I know, it was trick photography, but it is fantastic nonetheless. As for the translation of Kemo Sabey, it means ""Trusty Scout.""  That's what it meant when I was a kid, and that's what it means now. A friend told me recently that there was an article in the New York Times saying that ""neither the critics nor the public were ready for this movie.""  Well, the Lone Ranger fans were ready and cannot believe all the bad press from moronic critics who almost never get it right anyway. The only thing I can fault about the movie is they may have been a bit economical with the truth about the route of the railroad. I don't believe the Transcontinental RR went through Texas or Comanche territory, at least not the original section. As for Tonto's head gear, it is taken from a famous painting called ""I am Crow"" and should not be belittled as it may not be the same tribe, but it sure looked great on Johnny Depp.",1379116800,10,1403,4.3106060606060606
5825002,2,B00DJYJWVW,"It seems like all Native America wanted to talk about this summer was ""The Lone Ranger"" and whether it honored or offended Native Americans. I've read articles from Native people on both sides, so I'll let my words be few on this topic. Frankly, I expected it to be worse. It makes some honest, if clumsy and possibly misguided, attempts to honor Native peoples. Its greatest sin is that it relegates Native Americans to the past. Tonto appears to be the last living Indian, and he's hardly more than a peanut-guzzling wax figure in a Wild West museum. The filmmakers might be surprised to find that there are vital and growing Native communities in the 21st century.

""The Lone Ranger"" opens in a Wild West museum, where an extremely old Tonto is part of the display. This ancient Indian narrates the entire story to a young boy wearing a toy six-shooter and cowboy hat. About halfway through the film, we learn that Tonto (Johnny Depp), because of childhood trauma, has suffered a break with reality and is completely nuts. When you put these two scenes together - when you recognize that the whole movie is a story told by a man who has completely lost touch with reality - things start to make a little more sense.

This is a schizophrenic film. The experience of watching it is similar to what I imagine a visit to a mental hospital would be like. It veers from ridiculous to campy, from fast-paced and breathless to terribly serious to suddenly, perhaps unintentionally, funny again. It's hard to keep up. It might be pointless to try. Like an amusement park ride, the way it moves, jerks, veers and swoops will either make you light-headed and woozy, or it will make you puke.

Armie Hammer stars as a self-righteous lawyer who seems to believe that he can singlehandedly bring Justice and Order to the wild, wild West. This is the good guy, and also the film's first big problem: he's completely unlikable. From the beginning of the film to the end, he's stiff, and arrogant, and self-righteous. Even Tonto doesn't like him, but we'll get to that.

Hammer quickly gets deputized and rides out into the desert, where the bad guy, who literally eats the heart of his enemy, slaughters everyone around him. Yep, this is a kid's movie. Depp shows up to bury the dead bodies, but discovers that this one's only mostly dead. Mostly dead means slightly alive, so he nurses the stranger with the big white hat back to health, convinced by a bird (or a hallucination of a bird, I'm not sure) that this man can't be killed.

Depp and Hammer ride after the bad guys, only to discover that the good guys are actually the bad guys, and the original bad guys don't matter that much, and before long, the Army's involved, and we're all thoroughly confused as far as who's on which side and why.

Actually, I'd like to pause and talk about the Army, because it might be the one place where ""The Lone Ranger"" actually has something interesting to say. Barry Pepper plays the Army commander, who is sent in by the government to fight the Comanches, who attacking and killing innocent folks along the frontier. Pepper is presented by the film as a good man sent to do a job, and only concerned with doing it well and completely. It's only after he and his army have slaughtered an entire Comanche war party that he discovers that it wasn't the Comanches killing the ranchers after all, but railroad workers dressed up as Comanches because the evil railroad baron (Tom Wilkinson) wants the Comanches out of the way. Fuller has been tricked and manipulated.

Then, so quickly that you might miss it, Pepper comes to a watershed moment in his life -- will he admit that he has unwittingly done a terrible thing, slaughtering innocent people, then repent and try to make amends? Or will he continue down the road he's found himself on, buying the lie he's been told, a lie that justifies his own actions? In this all-too-brief moment, I think the makers of ""The Lone Ranger"" have hit upon the situation of most white Americans, and the tough choice in front of them -- to ignore/justify the past, or to go about the hard, soul-searching work of repentance and reconciliation, and seek a better future. Sadly, I'm afraid most people choose the same path Pepper chose.

""The Lone Ranger"" was a big box office disappointment for Disney, and I can't say that you'll miss much if you decide to skip it when it comes out on DVD soon. I didn't find it as terribly offensive as some people did, but frankly, it just wasn't a very good movie. There are certainly better things you could do with your time.",1378857600,7,4581,4.612269938650306
5825003,1,B00DJYJWVW,"Legendary English comic Tony Hancock did a bit where he was trying out for HAMLET.  He came in on a crutch, with a parrot on his shoulder, and proceeded to recite lines from HAMLET in the pirate accent of Robert Newton's Long John Silver.  When the director challenged him, Hancock defended his portrayal as ""his interpretation.""

The point is, you can only stretch an interpretation so far before you lose the character.

I looked forward to this ""Lone Ranger"" especially since the 1981 movie was simply awful.  I certainly liked the fact that they gave him a new look.  I wondered why the Lone Ranger in the old comic strip wore black trousers and a red shirt, when all the Lone Ranger artifacts I saw when I was growing up had him in blue.  Then I listened to the radio version.  The point of the Lone Ranger is that he can slip off his mask and blend in with the crowd.  I doubt he would have blended in very well in the old west in a tight, powder-blue suit.

Unfortunately, the movie began stretching the interpretation of the character. Naturally, they always have to go back through the creation of the Lone Ranger, just as they always have to retell the story of any other action hero from scratch in every new revamp.  As always, the fellow who becomes the Lone Ranger goes to join his brother with the Texas Rangers.  Pursuing an outlaw, the rangers are ambushed and the fellow who becomes the Lone Ranger is the sole survivor.  Thus, the Lone Ranger, get it?  As always, he is rescued by a lone Indian named Tonto and, for whatever reason, the two become more or less vigilantes, tracking down those who evade justice by other means.  But they are not bounty hunters, as the Lone Ranger and Tonto stumbled on a silver mine of their very own (where the Lone Ranger makes his own bullets) which gives him the economic freedom to pursue the causes of justice without having to take sordid bounties.

In this version, the fellow who becomes the Lone Ranger is a dim bulb, coming out west with books (somehow, being well-read is always a minus).  Don't think Jimmy Stewart in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence.""  This lunkhead is far further down the intellectual ladder.  It's as if the filmmakers believe reading somehow saps ones intelligence.  So much for education.

Of course, Tonto was always the street-smart, savvy fellow who shows the young Lone Ranger the ins and outs of the west.  So even there they are sticking to the typical storyline.

But no one seems to know how to write for heroic men anymore.  For centuries storytellers have taken imperfect men and fashioned heroes who tackled evils  greater than themselves.  This has not only fallen out of fashion, it's a forgotten art.

The tone of the movie is uneven.  We get low-brow comedy stooping to poop jokes.  Ha ha.  Then we get unbelievable violence, more becoming the grimmer spaghetti westerns.  But the filmmakers have no ideas how to adjust the tones, or mitigate either the stupid comedy or the graphic violence.

Then there is the take on America.  We expect modern filmmakers to mock religion, and those who have it are either fools, or hypocritical ratbag villains.  Again, there is no middle point.  Why not leave it out if you have nothing useful (or new) to say about it?  The most religious person in the film is probably Tonto, who sees ""spirits"" in everything, but he is mocked by his own people for that -- perhaps that's why Tonto always seems to be an outcast, a ""Lone"" who takes up with the Ranger because no one else wants him.

Also ridiculed are the Lone Ranger's scruples.  The point of the Lone Ranger is that he was striving for justice in a world where there was no justice.  The high standards he set for himself made him unfit for society, and he became more like an anchorite monk, striving for an ever higher good that he might never reach, but which was at least worth reaching for.

And what did the original Lone Ranger strive to reach for?  Generally, the same ideas as founded the nation.  From a list of Lone Ranger values combined one one of his co-creators, Fran Stryker, are ""That all men are created equal and that everyone has within himself the power to make this a better world"" and ""being prepared physically, mentally, and morally to fight when necessary for what is right"" and ""God put the firewood there, but that every man must gather and light it himself"" and ""all things change but truth, and that truth alone, lives on forever.""  But what do you do with such a character when you no longer believe in a truth (not a ""this"" truth or a ""that"" truth, but a truth at all?)

You do what's popular with your leftist friends.  The trend is, of course, bashing everything American.  We expect the American military, which stamped out slavery in this country, and went abroad to stamp out Hitler and free Concentration Camps, to be considered evil.  Everyone in the military is Custer.  And the bad guys, of course, are working for the greatest evil in the world, American Big Business (in this case, railroad ""barons"").  It's all the sort of thing Hollywood prides itself on, and awards, taking stands that are somehow ""brave"" even though they don't know anyone who disagrees with them.  It's how movies are written and made these days, sheer conformity.  And it's too bad it's coming out in the Disney imprimatur because Walt Disney believed in the freedoms and in the justice of America's founding documents.

But it's not merely peer pressure and doctrinaire Hollywood thinking that makes them bash America so much that when they play the ever vibrant ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" it has sinister overtones.  The fact is, that corporate town Hollywood, forever bashing corporations and businesses, is one of the biggest money-grubbing businesses ever (and always has been), has always made lots of its moolah by selling films abroad, where they can't seem to make movies like we can with good old American know-how.  Look again at grosses in America versus grosses worldwide.  When European markets for ""decadent"" American films were cut off by Hitler ruling Europe from the Atlantic to the Russian border, Hollywood decided to replace that loss of revenue by directing their films south of the border and promoting stars like Ricardo Montalban and Carmen Miranda.  Needless to say, foreigners who live in countries that have never understood or lived under American freedoms, and envy the American lifestyle until they have an irrational bigotry for all things American, welcome anything that makes America, and its freedoms and justice, look foolish.

Therefore, what is funny to the filmmakers is not situations involving the Lone Ranger, but rather the Lone Ranger's ideals, which they consider anachronisms.  They've long ago thrown out any idea that there can ever be a truth of any kind, thereby cutting off all dialogue with other points of view.  Then goes the conceptof justice, which the Lone Ranger is there to right (after all, filmmakers live in a cockeyed view of the American Justice system where everyone in prison is an innocent victim of ""the system"" but anyone who gets off is obviously guilty -- this plays big into the sensibilities, and will make money, from any nation without habeas corpus).  And the idea of Constitutional self-government and freedom is held up as stupid, too.  Because the Founders of America didn't snap their fingers and six thousand years of unfreedom suddenly didn't change overnight but American had to keep working to iron out kinks, means the whole concept of freedom, and government by the people, is something to ridicule.

Trying to make a movie about the Lone Ranger, and then mocking everything he was created to stand for, showing how hollow it is, is like putting Long John Silver into the role of Hamlet.  Why didn't they just make up their own Lone Rangeresque character and make a mockery of him.

Oh, I said I liked the change of the Lone Ranger costume.  It's funny they made him black, since the original radio Lone Ranger was really a knock-off imitation of another of my favorite heroes, Zorro.  They've basically turned the Lone Ranger a stupid Zorro in a white Stetson rather than a black gaucho hat. It's just another indication of how shallow is Hollywood's imagination these days, yet it's marketed by the studio that at one time had the greatest imagination of all.",1378857600,23,8360,4.740484429065744

Now, I do agree that Johnny Depp's Tonto is almost another iteration of Jack Sparrow from POTC movies, but it was still engaging and fun.  Even my teenage daughters thought it was very good.  We all watched it right after seeing Man of Steel and we all agreed that Lone Ranger was far more entertaining than the Superman reboot.

If you want to watch something that will entertain the entire family and not worry about every technical aspect and flaw that the so-called critics keep hammering on, then you will enjoy it.  Not the most original storyline or greatest dialogues in film, but it has its own charm and is definately worth seeing.  I could overanalyze the film and try to pick it apart, but that is not what I am paid to do.  I go to movies to simply enjoy a story and be taken on an adventure.  This film entertained and took me on a 2 1/2 hour adventure that I definately would recommend. I also plan to purchase this as soon as it is released.",1378339200,40,1246,4.282051282051282
5825008,2,B00DJYJWVW,"Disney's 2013 summer blockbuster hopeful, The Lone Ranger, stars Johnny Depp as the lovable but stoic Tonto and Armie Hammer as John Reid, a bumbling lawyer soon-to-be hero.
Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and directed by Gore Verbinski (the same team that brought you the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films), The Lone Ranger follows the story of John Reid and his sidekick Tonto as they gallivant across Texas in 1869...and it's a rough, bloated ride.
Development on The Lone Ranger began in early 2007 but was pushed back due to script rewrites and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides taking priority. The film suffered a large setback in 2011 when Disney announced the film would be delayed due to budget concerns. Gore Verbinski, Armie Hammer, and Johnny Depp all deferred 20% of their salary to help lower the overall cost of the film. Despite their sacrifice, The Lone Ranger cost nearly $215 million to produce and only made $29 million in its first weekend. Yikes.

The Story:
Lawyer John Reid returns to his hometown of Lonesome Dove where his brother is a Texas Ranger. His brother's wife, Rebecca, has a romantic history with John, but they haven't seen each other in years. Railroad tycoon Latham Cole wants to take complete control over a railroad company and a mineral-rich silver mine. He will stop at nothing to achieve his goals even going as far as to shoot one of his board members in the leg. Cole sets a plan up using a murderous lunatic named Butch Cavendish to do his dirty work.
John, his brother, and the rest of the Texas Ranger posse go off to capture Cavendish. All of them are brutally ambushed and murdered except John. Tonto, the Apache Indian, comes to John's rescue, and they set off to get revenge on Cavendish.

The Good:
* Armie Hammer as John Reid/The Lone Ranger.
o Hammer nails the role of John Reid. He's likable and his character arc from zero-to-hero is one of the best parts of the movie.

* The visuals.
o They're absolutely incredible. Flat salt deserts, deep canyons, and massive sunsets give The Lone Ranger the Western feel it needed.

* The last thirty minutes were just astonishing.
o It was everything an adventure/action film should be. One-liners, over the top spectacle, and a humorous exchange at the end made me wonder why they saved the best for last.

The Bad:
* The length.
o This film badly needed an editor to cut the monstrosity that was 149 minutes long. I enjoy long movies. I could watch the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings over and over and not get bored, but something about The Lone Ranger couldn't keep me invested.

* Johnny Depp as Tonto.
o I'm a huge Depp fan. Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the most memorable and likeable characters in recent film history. But Tonto was just weird. Depp's usual quirky character roles didn't fit Tonto in the least. Stick to Captain Jack, please. And as for Tonto, why wasn't a real Native American cast? Oh yeah, we'll get to that in a minute.

* The pacing.
o This goes hand in hand with the length of the film. It just didn't flow well. The romantic subplot between John and his brother's widow was unnecessary. The frame technique of old, wrinkly Tonto telling a little boy the story of The Lone Ranger at a fair in 1933 didn't work well and kept taking me out of the film. Most scenes dragged on and on. By the end you just didn't care how it was going to turn out.

* Humor v. Darkness.
o This film had a real issue balancing its silliness with its darkness. It's a Disney film, so understandably it needs to be lighthearted, right? Six Texas Rangers get ambushed and murdered. A cannibal eats one of their hearts immediately after. Some scenes are just too intense for a fun adventure film. It's too inconsistent with the violence and the gags. The film should be fun, not jarring. See Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl for a Disney movie that handles that balance the right way.

The Ugly:
* The Horse
o Tonto is scene conversing with him several times throughout the film and the horse seemingly communicates back. In a film somewhat grounded in reality, this is where I have a hard time suspending my disbelief for two and a half hours. After a climactic scene in which many Native Americans get slaughtered by the U.S. Calvary, Tonto looks to the sky and the horse is just standing on a tree branch. No mention of the genocide that just took place, just an acrobatic horse joke.

* Tonto again.
o I've already mentioned Johnny Depp's portrayal of Tonto, but can we just talk for a minute about Tonto the character? In the film, Tonto is portrayed as an Apache Indian who covers almost every Native American stereotype in the book. Granted, this film is a Western/Adventure but seriously, did we need the ear-to-the-ground-to-get-directions gag? Tonto also wears a dead bird on his head and feeds crumbs to it that fall to the floor seemingly at random. His catchphrase kemosabe was totally butchered. In the old radio programs that The Lone Ranger was based on, kemosabe meant ""loyal scout"" or ""faithful companion"" but in this film, Tonto translates it to mean ""wrong brother."" What is that?

I'd probably watch The Lone Ranger again if I was bored enough, but I definitely wouldn't pay for it. Hi-yo Silver, go away!",1378252800,3,5320,4.630965005302227

It is not really for a grown up either. The humor is fail. The main character is so annoying stupid that I wanted him to die in each and every battle. Johnny Depp's character, is Johnny Depp, but Disney tried to play with the suffering of Indians and Chinese, but it is painfully bad. As far as realism goes... I can forgive the unlimited ammunition in the 6 shooters, but the magical flying horse who can jump 60 feet and land on the top of a train is stupid. Ultimately, I thought it would be a date movie with a happy ending. My wife got up (1st time she ever did this), said ""This is terrible. I'm going to bed!"". Well none of us got a happy ending!

These two are supposed to be the western version of Sherlock Holmes and Watson. They were supposed to be friends tostart off woth, instead they looked like Oscar & Feliux from the Odd Couple. They made the Lone Ranger look like he didn't know how to fight or shoot and that all of his skill was just accidental victories. This was horrible and drug out too long.

5825013,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I wondered why so many gave this movie a negative review when I really like this movie so I read those reviews and I'd like to address some of the more confusing aspects to the story.

First the disclaimers: 1). If one goes to the super market and shops for steak and only brings home cheese, then one is diss-appointed, but if one goes for cheese and brings home some of the best cheese out there then they should feel elated. When you see this movie expect over the top action, funny sequences and a modern retake of the original interplay between the Lone Ranger and Tonto. Don't expect this to be a somber tribute or the old TV series and you'll be able to enjoy it for what it is.

2). I'm only part native but I have been asked ""What tribe are you from?"" by perfect strangers before I've had the chance to speak more than three words to them.

There are plenty of reviews praising this movie and some reviews which don't understand certain things. I can't shed light on everything, but let me shed light on why this movie is deeper than what most people suspect.

I've been subjected to a lot of the myths and the stories from the drum circles and the dream keepers and I can shed some light on the oddities in this movie.

Here's some things to keep in mind while watching this movie:
Johnny Depp showed a deep sadness and a deep madness (part of being manic depressive) - Most Native Americans can say they lost a relative who died of the depression. The spirit sickness. Sometimes those who get overcome by the depression spend half their time laughing and cracking jokes and half their time wishing to die. Their minds only maintain balance if they are forced to focus on something important in their daily life. Tonto also shows hints of being an untrained shaman (as in one who didn't apprentice under an elder) and as such may be seen as just crazy even by other natives. Part of the mysticism is the balance between doubt and belief and the movie doesn't make the choice for you.

The fact that this movie doesn't spell things out for people and challenges people with the ""absurd"" is a good thing in my opinion as it can get people to ask questions and to explore things. The movie presents a few mysteries which are always good and I think attempts to persuade people to research Native American culture which is also good. Here are a few things which pertain to the movie.

- Medicine men of many tribes may tell you that the power of the spirit can transcend time and space... pay attention to the bag of peanuts when you watch this movie, you'll see that this is touched upon.

- The term Wendigo is used to address one of the characters in the movie and it does refer to an evil spirit/alternate form of a human being... it is caused by cannibalism and both silver and boiling fat have been attributed as being weaknesses to it (by pouring boiling fat down it's throat or wounding it with silver).

- The Spirit Horse is spirit made flesh and it can show up where it wants and when it wants.

- When nature is out of balance, the spirit world (the Hunting Grounds) are like a reflection to the real world, evil and dark spirits can take hold of or poison the thoughts and behaviors of animals in the real world. From [...] when an individual is out of balance ""the individual experiences sickness. While this might be a physical illness, it might also manifest itself as a psychosis."" Though that passage spoke about people the same principals are applied to animals.

Now onto the movie: The banter between the Lone Ranger (LR) and Tonto was awesome and reminiscent of the original series (though with a more modern looser sense of what is tolerable or not). Though it is a bit more lop-sided here (yeah Tonto shows a sharper and quicker wit than the LR, but the way Armie Hammer portrayed LR doesn't show a veteran but someone who will become the legendary Lone Ranger ... i.e. think Batman: Year One etc.).

Some of the action scenes were a bit over the top and slap stick in nature, but the film doesn't dwell on these or offer them up in awkward sequences - everything seemed to fit together with great pacing.

The themes showed in the movie weren't aimed at children: LR's unrequited love of his brother's wife, cannibalism, and a major battle scene all justify the PG-13 rating.

The lighting helped set the mood and the photography was great.

The music and sound were a bit too old school Disney family fun initially and was distracting for about the first twenty minutes of the movie, but afterwards actually helped set the mood, pacing and overall theme. (Which is a great job since people do tend to have different musical tastes - in my opinion it would have been slightly better to have the music set initially at a lower volume and then set to gradually ramp back up).

It was definitely a treat to watch. The acting from both male leads was highly entertaining. I paid for my ticket to get entertained and to see an adventure and I got what I paid for.",1377734400,952,4989,4.447973713033954
5825014,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Reading the positive reviews on here (and just a few other places on the internet) gives me hope.

Today's movie goers have no concept of a true movie,how it has alot of hard work put into it. This is sad as it reflects highly of our modern times and the action junkies some of us have become. I for one,look forward to this movie coming out on blu-ray. I want to enjoy it without distractions from some idiot whining about the movie being too slow,or needing more action!
I have seen this movie twice now,I guess most people overlooked the fact that the story was being told through Tonto's point of view,I LOVED IT and laughed alot! For the life of me I can't understand why it did so bad in the theaters! The story was great,good humor throughout,and it didn't take itself TOO serious! The characters were well developed and the period in which it took place still ranks as a favorite to many Americans. Maybe the audience paid TOO much attention to the critics. I remember when the critics bombed star wars when it first came out. It's too bad the same movie goers aren't around now like they were back then. They did their own thinking,went out and saw the movie,and the rest,well...you now what happened afterwords!

5825016,3,B00DJYJWVW,"""The Lone Ranger"" is an action-packed adventure movie starring Johnny Depp, directed by Gore Verbinski and co-produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The three names are responsible for the hugely successful ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" that spawned three sequels so far. So it is nothing surprising for us to see them together again. It should be a winning formula for Disney, but somehow things didn't turn out as the studio had expected.

I'm not talking about the film's box office revenue, but the film itself, which is reasonably entertaining, but too long by thirty minutes and uneven in tone. ""The Lone Ranger"" starts with a ""frame narrative,"" where a young boy listens to the story of an aged native Indian posing like a mannequin.

The unique narrative device could have worked better had the main story not been so convoluted. ""The Lone Ranger"" opens and ends with fine action set-pieces, but spends so much time in the mid-section about the back stories of John Reid/Lone Ranger, Tonto and villains, that when you finally hear the famous William Tell overture, the film is almost over.

For a film that begins with a Disney logo, the body count is pretty high. The actors have nice chemistry, but the film doesn't know how to make full use of it. I for one enjoyed the climactic Buster Keaton-inspired action sequence, though some viewers may find it too long and silly. Certainly ""The Lone Ranger"" is not that bad. It is not that great, either, however, wasting the fine performances from the leads Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer.",1377475200,3,1530,4.854406130268199

The movie is too long for it's own good, over two hours for god's sake. The story is kinda boring, but the exposition given to Tonto I thought was good, but quickly forgotten as it is introduced. Most of the movie is dialogue, not good either, and when the action does come, it can be a bit of an overkill. The sets are nice but generic, and Hans Zimmer did a fairly good soundtrack.

The ""Lone Ranger"" isn't supposed to be that dark, which is the major problem with this movie; but there IS a storyline.

The Only Faults Truly Lay with their ignorance of this Movie's concept & purpose!  I grew up loving the TV Series, and any ole films!  I've seen TOO Many Critics reference/compare This Film to Those, when in fact, it Never Should Have Been!!  THIS MOVIE is based on the 1940's RADIO SHOW.  The folks who listened to that already knew things the later TV Series & film Audiences did not!  The Latter results were based on the radio foundation.  Basically, we all ""Came in on situations already formed and happening"", without ever knowing ""The Beginning""!  Example: TV Series always ended with The Lone Ranger giving the poor victim's survived loved ones 2 Silver Bullets.  Silver was $$$!  Why silver & where did he get all that from?!  Was he as wealthy as a ""Bruce Wayne""?!  To just keep handing these extravagant items out?!  This Film takes us to ""The Beginning""- it explains & answers many Key Points relevant to what the later films & TV Series were based & continued upon.  It's ""the Formation""!  Ask yourselves, ""In a time when Texas had Many Rangers, Why This One?!""  He wasn't born a hero, ""How did he get to be known as one?""  At a time there was tension and fighting between US Settlers and Native American Indians, ""How did a White Man end up Partners with an Indian?!  Why not another Texas Ranger?!""  ""How did he even become a Ranger in the 1st Place?""  ""Why him and not somebody else?""  ""Why not just Tonto being the only Hero?""  Also, ""There were many Indians occupying the lands.  Why Tonto and not some other Indian?!""  ""Why not Tonto being partners with another Indian?!""  ""Why did this Indian partner with this White Man?""  ""Where did their horses come from and why did the Lone Ranger specifically choose his horse's name as Silver?!"" (They don't mention Tonto's horse, but we know it's Scout!  I bet if there'd been a sequel, we'd know why!).  ""What drives a man to act as he does, to change his whole life and why does he decide to continue being ""The Lone Ranger"" with his mask & Indian Companion when there are Still other Texas Rangers throughout the land?""  ""You've also got the Calvary and Huge Industries with Their Own Privately Hired & Paid Security.  Why doesn't he choose to join with them?  Why still an Indian?!""  It's Socially Wrong for Both their Peoples to work together, yet They Are!  ""Why not regular available bullets?  Why Silver bullets?!  Where'd he get all that silver from?!""  THIS Movie answers ALL and More!!!  I'd compare it to John Wayne in ""Rio Lobo""!!  It's Action Packed, well written & Cast, Adventurous, Excellent Timed Humor in parts (just like Rio Lobo), and Great Stunts and displays!!!  Gore Verbinski keeps to ""The Times"" it's all supposed to be happening in an Accurate Historical Way!  If you loved the TV Series, great!  But, you've missed how it all started!!!  The Beginning is brilliantly and entertainingly told from the Viewpoint of an Older Tonto- as he saw from his experience.  This, coming ""From an Uneducated Savage"" makes for a more interesting of a tale than had the Highly Collegic Lone Ranger had told it!  Which also answers ""Why did a Highly Educated Lawyer Graduate choose to be Companion with a Non-Educated Wilder Man?!""  The ""Pro Critics"" were WRONG & THIS isn't ""Just about Tonto""- ""It's about The Lone Ranger and their getting together!""  Depp doesn't ""Have Tonto only steal the show""- Army Hammer perfectly balances & bounces off of Johnny Depp!  The end result is they compliment eachother!  The horse is a Huge Star in his own right, too & works with All!  Every person Cast is ""Dead On Perfect for their roles!"".  You will have many answers, while being Highly Entertained!!!  I plan on Buying this when it becomes available.  In closing: A few Movies ""Top Critics"" gave Most Amount of Negative Reviews: ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Casa Blanca"", ""Star Wars"", ""Titanic, ""The Godfather, Part 2"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Jaws"", and ""Taxi Driver""!!!  They are SO Wrong on This, Too!!!!!!!!",1376870400,7,4097,4.729461756373937
5825025,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Obviously this is a film that rubs a LOT of people the wrong way, but for reasons I'm still trying to figure out it's absolute catnip to me. The first time I saw a still of Johnny Depp in his Tonto makeup with the stuffed crow on his head I said to myself, I've gotta see this. Then, after seeing it in the theater, I thought it was so extremely fantastic in every way that I had to go back a couple of days later to make sure it really was as good as I'd remembered.

I like the way this film takes time-honored cliches of the Western film and uses them as a solid framework for a very unique, creative and eclectic take on the Western. You've got so much going on here, with the parable of the corporate raider versus the unlikely alliance of the left-wing lawyer turned outlaw and the rogue Native American libertarian (I'm thinking Mitt Romney versus Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul.) But most enchanting to me is Johnny Depp's tragicomic Tonto, who I think is his finest character to date. Clearly he's an homage to Buster Keaton with his stone face and supernatural ability to survive very dangerous bouts of physical comedy, but also as another reviewer has mentioned a take on the Native American sacred clown, whose eccentric viewpoint helps him and those around him to survive.",1376784000,12,1283,4.482905982905983

I think my favorite part of the film was when the traditional Lone Ranger theme (William Tell Overture) finally kicked in when the tide turned--great moment!

If you ever listened to the Lone Ranger on radio or the TV series, this tells it all from the origin and it is extremely well done and acted. It is a spoof, but with respect to the Cheyenne.... Tonto is more of a silent leader and partner rather than a lackey. It has its' moments of realistic wild west violence, but the underlying moral theme prevails, and for me, lots of chuckles.

The Indians finally get a fair image in this film. They are no longer the wild people, sorry animals that were depicted for so long. In fact this un acceptable image is completely put upside down and thus the truth is recaptured.

The truth is that some people were ready to make a profit, and even a fortune, by all means available. There were some idealists in DC offices that were speaking of progress, humanity, good and happiness for people, etc. But in the field that was a completely different picture. Some who had power were ready to exploit workers building the railroads, essentially Chinese, as if they were slaves without the ""title."" In real life people were not shot dead when resisting, they were the victims of sorry accidents and a silver dollar was given to the widows.

These people who had power in the railroad companies, and other industries, were ready to use all those who could impose work for a pittance with violence, brutal violence if necessary, guns and gunshots, if not manipulated and rigged accidents. Who was going to ask questions about dead Chinese?

The Indians were in the way. So they were exterminated with the cavalry if necessary who always shot first and asked questions from the Whites about the Indians second. Or they were starved to death by the extermination of all buffaloes by people like Buffalo Bill. Or they were pushed away and locked up in reservations. All kinds of treacherous actions were possible including using outlaws disguised as Indians to attack some farmers and start a war.

Add to the phenomenal profits that were to come from the railroads the fact that they found some natural resources that were worth fortunes, in this case silver and you have the magic potion that can turn the most honest and law-abiding clerk into the most aggressive criminal.

But the film is also clear about the fact that all people were not like that and there were some who did believe in progress, humanity and the ""government of the people for the people by the people"" and were able to resist the hooligans who were at the head of such industrial ventures, including some women and some children, on both sides actually.

When you remember the Pocahontas films who defended a myth of colonial history in Virginia, you can measure the distance that has been run by Walt Disney with this film that is honest and presented in such a way, with such special effects and with no lackluster scene or slowing down so that the interest is constantly at its maximum. Hence the film is perfect for a young audience in the summer that wants entertainment, and yet educational too.  The decolonialization, or mental decolonization, of Indians in the USA is now well on the road to success. And it all started in Alcatraz in 1969. We may not be able to redo history, but we are able to correct it.

5825033,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I would first like to point out that I never watched the show, knew nothing about it, and could careless about it as well. The show was before I was born but my mom remembers it.

That being said.. I didn't know what to expect from this movie since the trailers confused me on what it was all about (again not familiar with the show) but I went to see it anyways because 1. I had a free ticket from my Oz Great and Powerful bluray I bought and 2. Johnny Depp was in it.
So I dragged a friend along to watch it. I thought it was funny in certain parts and thought Johnny did a great job as a Native American Indian. I also liked how they put some real life history into the movie as well with the railroad and how the natives were actually treated back then. To be honest I didn't know Chinese people built the railroads cause my school history books left that part out.

This movie is PG-13 so if your child can't handle the violence shown in the movie then don't take them to see it or wait for it to come out on dvd so you can rent it. There is one scene where a heart is eaten but you don't see anything and it's not a gory scene either just might be a bit disturbing for children if they are not use to seeing that type of content.

Overall I loved this movie and plan to buy it on bluray when it comes out. Also if you are a spiritual person there are a lot of things in the movie you will understand about Johnny Depp's character than other people from a different religion would.

5825034,5,B00DJYJWVW,"The Lone Ranger is the hero of my childhood, and this movie is absolutely wonderful. Many of us in the theater nearly leaped out of our seats when the William Tell Overture began. I am SO disgusted with the critics who likely have no clue about Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels and what the Lone Ranger stood for in the 1950s. This movie is very different from that, but is so good that I just can't do it justice. Although it is certainly not a kid's movie, it is a great vehicle to introduce new generations to this all-American story. Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp are perfect in their roles. The cinematography is gorgeous, the stunts remind me of the Indiana Jones trilogy, and the humor is priceless. It is dreadful that it may be pulled from the theatres prematurely due to poor reviews by some lowly critics who think they have to criticize for the sake of criticism or perhaps because it's a western. It is one of those movies you need to see more than once to get all of it. I put in on the same plane as ""A Christmas Story"" that was pulled early from the theaters when it came out, but then went on to become the greatest Christmas classic of all time. This movie was a long time coming and certainly deserves much more respect that it's getting. Hopefully the public will save the day.

I think that Depp/Tonto 'owned' the movie for the first two hours - with the Lone Ranger being drug along in various stages of willingness.  Furthermore - Tonto had all of the good lines.

At about 23 minutes from the end of the movie, Tonto gets out of the driver's seat - to make room for ""The Lone Ranger"".  Minimal dialog, lots of action, chases, pithy one liners and a great sense of joy and satisfaction all occur in a short 20 minute window.

For me - one of the great movies of the past several years.

[Yes, historical inaccuracies abound, and the guns often seem to never run out of bullets, laws of physics are suspended and silliness prevails.  BUT - remember you were supposed to leave 'reality' at the box office - before you entered the theater.]

In the scene for the dedication of the Transcontinental Railroad the band was playing ""Stars and Stripes Forever"". That piece of music didn't exist at that time. It wasn't composed by John Phillip Sousa until the late 1890's. Other than that a GREAT MOVIE. Looking forward to release on Blu-ray or DVD.",1375833600,5,433,4.945205479452055
5825039,1,B00DJYJWVW,"Jerry Bruckheimer, Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp attempt to bring back The Lone Ranger for the modern audience, but utterly fail miserably. Admittedly I have been critical of the film, the uninspiring trailers, the one trick pony director and the obviously badly written script. Yes I have been openly critical of The Lone Ranger, but I have also tried to keep an open mind about the film even with my severe doubts about the film, because I have been proven wrong before about films before like the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, and more recently with World War Z. Both films surprised, and I had hoped that The Lone Ranger would surprise me proving my criticism of the film wrong, and at very least be if nothing else an entertaining film. Unsurprisingly I was proven correct about my criticism about The Lone Ranger as the film is a ridiculously embarrassing film with a laughably bad script, cheesy dialoged and uninspired action making the Lone Ranger one of the worst films of the year.

The film opens in San Francisco in the 1930's with Will a young child dressed as the Lone Ranger visiting a Wild West museum at a carnival where he meets an aged Tonto (Johnny Depp) who tells him the story of his adventure with The Lone Ranger/John Reid (Armie Hammer). From the beginning when Tanto first meets John while he is traveling with imprisoned famed outlaw Butch Cavendish (played by the talented William Fichtner) to rescuing John after his brother Dan Reid (James Badge Dale) and his Texas Ranger posse are ambushed and killed by Cavendish and his gang to the climax on the railway with one speeding train chasing after another speeding train carrying tones of pure silver. Behind the storytelling of Tanto is the so called plot, which has to do with the transcontinental railway, and two men's goal of mining out all the silver in the mountains of Indian Territory to gain money and power.

The flaws of the script are too count, but I will go over a few glaring ones that especially hurt the film. Perhaps the biggest were the scenes in San Francisco with Will and Tanto that added nothing to the film. I am not sure why Verbinski and the writers wanted to add these scenes. Maybe they wanted to convey Tanto's sadness and regret over something he did in the past, and you do see some of that in the film, but I do not think it was necessary to add these scenes when the scenes already conveyed these emotions. The writers certainly did not need to add these scenes that took away from the already bad film. Following the needless scenes that hurt The Lone Ranger was the laughable dialog. I know the writers intentionally mixed humor in with the drama and action, but many of the dialog and scenes were unintentionally funny. One example is with the so called love triangle between John, Dan and Rebecca Reid (Ruth Wilson). The supposedly romantic and dramatic scenes, and dialog between these characters were cheesy and poorly written, which is not helped that no of these characters have any chemistry together. It just sometimes felt like the writers were not sure what direction they wanted to take the film, whether to make The Lone Ranger a western comedy or a serious action western. Sadly the writers failed on both accounts.

I do think The Lone Ranger could have overcome some of these flaws if not for the badly written and useless characters. Red Harrington (Helena Bonham Carter) a brothel owner is completely wasted in The Lone Ranger. Her character was only written to move two plot points forward, which is unfortunate because Helena Bonham Carter a capable actress who deserved a better role than Red. The casting of Johnny Depp as Tonto was in my opinion a poor acting choice, but he is Gore's go to actor. Depp has tried to defend his casting of Tanto by saying his partially decedent from native Americans, and maybe that is true, but I would have preferred Bruckheimer and Verbinski had actually casted a native American. I know there are not a lot of well-known native American actors in Hollywood with one being Eddie Spears from Hell on Wheels who I believe could have done a much better job playing Tanto than Depp. Even if Bruckheimer and Verbinski could not get Spears they could have found an up and coming or struggling actor for the role of Tonto, but we ended up being stuck with Depp as Tonto. Depp's performance as Tonto is just a poor characterization of Captain Jack Sparrow, and a badly performed one at that. I do not know why Depp insists on playing eccentric characters like Sparrow, Tonto or the Mad Hatter when I believe Depp delivers better performances as a more grounded character like as Donnie Brasco or George Jung in Blow. These performances as over the top eccentric characters are getting tiring, and are not entertaining as they once were. The one bright spot in the film was the character Butch Cavendish who at vicious and unapologetic, and perhaps the only character in the film that I actually enjoyed. I really enjoy William Fichtner who has given great supporting roles in The Perfect Storm, Armageddon, Prison Break and The Big Band, and think he is a highly underrated actor. In The Lone Ranger he is the polished turd in this crap fest. Fichtner delivers a strong performance as Cavendish, and gives the character life with his menacing facial expressions and dialog. I know it is wrong to root for the villain in the film, but I was hoping he would survive and win unfortunately the writers messed up again in the climax and gave the character and actor a poor farewell.

Gore Verbinski directing style has become predictable I mean his past four to five films from the Pirates films to The Lone Ranger to Rango have the same tone, style and feeling to them, and just like Depp's choice to play endless weird characters it is getting tiring and played out. Here in The Lone Ranger he directs the same as his previous films, shows the same kind of action scenes and the almost the exact same type of dialog. A director is supposed to lead the film to its final destination, but Gore seems lost in his story telling meandering between one needless plot point and character to the next. It was interesting and entertaining in the first Pirates film and Rango, but now it is just not compelling at all anymore.

Recently I had a discussion with someone who said that The Lone Ranger was filmed basically without any effects or CGI at all. It was laughable then and it is laughable now just not in the way you are thinking. Yes of course there are a lot of effects done by companies like ILM, but they are poorly done and ridiculously bad. There were only two scenes that I remotely enjoyed. The first was the opening action sequence on the train, and the simple action scene where The Lone Ranger and Tonto ambush Cavendish's men in a silver mine. The rest of the action scenes were poorly done, choreographed and filmed. Then there was the climax which was supposed to be compelling and entertaining, but instead was laughably bad, boring, poorly planned out, and uninteresting, which was not helped by the music that went with the scene. Perhaps the only real bright spot in the film besides Fichtner's performance was the cinematography. The Lone Ranger was filmed in New Mexico and Arizona and beautifully showcased the natural geography of the region from the desert canons to the mountains the cinematographer beautifully showcased the natural wonders of the two states.

I have never wanted to walk out of a theater in a long time. I think the last film I actually walked out of was Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and I really did want to walk out of The Lone Ranger that is how bad the film was. The Long Ranger is a poorly planned out film, with terrible writing and dialog along with bad acting, effects and action, and piss poor directing with the only saving grace being William Fichtner, but even with his strong performance Fichtner could not single handedly save The Lone Ranger. I am confident without a doubt that The Lone Ranger will go down has one of the worst films of the year along with After Earth and Die Hard, highly recommend everyone avoid this film at all costs.",1375660800,12,8163,4.665277777777778

5825041,3,B00DJYJWVW,"There is something inherently disappointing about going to a heavily hyped summer film and leaving the theater with a less than ecstatic feeling.

Every year, every studio bets heavily on a handful of ""tent-pole"" releases - films with huge budgets north of $100 million (although $200 million is becoming more common), special effects from beginning to end and male leads ready to prove they are worthy of their $20 million paychecks. As with any bet, there will be winners and losers. If they win, the inevitable sequels have built in promotion and they will continue to generate revenue for years to come.

But if they lose...

Gore Verbinski's ""The Lone Ranger"" starring Johnny Depp, Armie Hammer (""J. Edgar"", ""The Social Network""), Tom Wilkinson, William Fichtner (lots of TV work, currently on NBC's ""Crossing Lines"") and Helena Bonham Carter is the Disney Studios' big gamble for 2013. Narratively, the film is good, but the built up anticipation makes it feel like a loss. Financially, the film is already labeled a dud and it is a film Disney is already trying to overcome. Don't expect any ""Lone Ranger"" attractions at any of the Disney parks.

Johnny Depp has made a career of playing strange, over-the-top characters. He does them well, providing interesting performances, even when the film doesn't measure up. But in the last few years, this type of character seems to be all he does and the public is growing less interested; his last few films have flopped. I am personally growing tired of the strange, heavily made-up characters that seem to have become the actor's stock and trade. I know he gets huge paychecks for these films (reportedly $40 million for the last ""Pirates"" film), but he would be well served by taking a less-showy role, allowing him to show off his acting chops.

The unusual aspects of his characters also seem to permeate the few more normal roles he has recently done. In Michael Mann's ""Public Enemies"", he played a gangster who seems crazier than was probably necessary. ""The Tourist"" is an interesting idea, but it doesn't work either. ""The Rum Diary"" was a spectacular failure; no one seemed interested in Depp's return as Hunter Thompson. And let's face it, if there is a human being similar to any of the strange characters Depp plays, it is Thompson.

Unfortunately, it looks like we can expect more of the same. Depp already had ""Pirates 5"" lined up before this film was released. But when it quickly became apparent ""Ranger"" was a flop, Depp's people went into hyperdrive and lined up  ""Through the Looking Glass"", the sequel to ""Alice in Wonderland"". These are exactly the types of roles Depp should be staying away from.

In ""The Lone Ranger"", Depp plays Tonto, a Comanche Indian who seems very involved in the story from the beginning. He is being held prisoner in the same rail car with Butch Cavendish (Fichtner), a notorious outlaw who according to legend eats the still-beating hearts of his victims. When Cavendish escapes, Tonto quickly gets free and never seems to be far behind the outlaw. John Reid (Hammer), an idealistic lawyer returning to rural Texas to start his new practice, joins his brother Adam (James Badge Dale) in a posse. The posse is quickly ambushed and Tonto rescues John, encouraging him to become the Masked Man. A Masked Man will be able to more easily extract revenge for both of them.

There is a definite attempt to make this a more PC-appropriate portrait of the Lone Ranger and Tonto. Basically, Tonto seems to be the brains, molding and shaping Reid into his personal vigilante. My problem with this setup comes from Hammer's portrayal of Reid as a buffoon. Early on, Reid is full of himself; confident he can make a change in the Wild West by simply sticking to his idealism and ignoring the reality of his new environment. As he morphs into the Lone Ranger, he continues to make dumb decisions and more often than not, his simple dumb luck seems to help him persevere.

As this character trait continues, a couple of things happen. Reid doesn't change a lot, which makes him less interesting. It also shows us that Tonto seems to regard his partner as a buffoon illustrating the fact they don't really like one another. Which leads to the question: why should we care about them if they don't care about each other?

The most successful aspect of the film is the storytelling device. A young boy walks into a Wild West Show at a San Francisco carnival in 1933. As the boy, wearing a Lone Ranger outfit, wanders through the displays, he stops to look at the ""Noble Savage"" and is startled when the statue's eyes begin to move. The elderly Tonto begins to relate the story of the origins of the legend. While it may seem strange to have a human being, let alone a Native American, working as a human mannequin, this helps to spin and sell the tall-tale aspect of the film. The young boy could be imagining the conversation with the elderly Tonto; he probably is, because he stops the story a few times when Tonto's narrative becomes too outlandish.

Verbinski and the writers (all of whom created the ""Pirates"" films) don't do a very good job of hiding a potential plot twist. As soon as a character makes an appearance, you know he or she will be revealed as something else all together, making this moment pointless.

The best aspect of the film is the action; Verbinski clearly has a lot of fun playing with his toys. There are a number of lengthy, complicated action sequences involving or set on trains. At one point, Depp's Tonto jumps and swings back and forth between two moving trains. Depp's stone face and the nature of the stunts instantly brought to mind the great silent comedian Buster Keaton. Given Depp's well-documented admiration for Keaton, the similarity is not a mistake. It's nice work and it is well done.

Less interesting is the pacing of the film. At 149 minutes, it is too long and despite all of the narrative and action, it seems to drag. The filmmakers depict the lengthy backstory of both the Lone Ranger and Tonto, which is a big mistake. The backstories and the framing device seem to slow down a film packed with elaborate, fun action scenes. It would have made sense to save one of these stories for the sequel, and concentrate on just one of the characters in this film. I suspect that because Depp is the star, the draw, and he is playing the non-title character, the filmmakers included both to make Depp's performance viable. It was a bad decision made because a lot of money is at stake,

There is an impressive collection of character actors involved in the film. In addition to Wilkinson and Fichtner, James Badge Dale, Leon Rippy, Barry Pepper and others are all naturals for a big, all-out Western. Even James Frain, a popular British actor who has appeared in ""Tron: Legacy"", ""True Blood"" and many other films and television shows, pops up as one of Cavendish's henchmen in a role that can barely be labeled a cameo. It is nice to see all of these actors in roles that are a natural fit. Their appearances make the landscape feel more real and viable.

Much like Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter has been hiding behind elaborate, over-the-top characters and too much makeup for a long time. Maybe both have been hanging around Tim Burton for too long, but we'll save that for another review. In ""Ranger"", Bonham-Carter plays Red Harrington, the red-haired madam of a whorehouse. But she is no ordinary madam; she has a porcelain leg with special features. The porcelain leg is strange and unusual. We don't know why she has it, so it just becomes an unexplained oddity.

Normally, I would focus on the good parts of a movie and then discuss any bad moments. For this movie, it was necessary to skip back and forth. ""The Lone Ranger"" is the very definition of a mixed bag, with both good and bad, making it difficult to clearly differentiate between the two. And, ultimately, this makes the film a bit of a wash.

Mr. Depp;

In a way it goes back to basics literally with a good dose of action thrown in for good measure. Hans Zimmer's score was exceptionally moving and rousing in many ways.

5825045,3,B00DJYJWVW,"The same Disney ""Pirates of the Carrabian"" production team is back. That is producer Jerry Bruckheimer (The Amazing Race, Armageddon), Director Gore Verbinski (The Mexican, The Ring) and the Star and Executive Producer himself Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Finding Neverland) have come together again to bring another legendary character back to life in this modern 21st century day and age and I'm sure in their hopes - another $$$ franchise.

The movie itself is way too long for what it has to offer. The story is weak and almost so thin it may lead you to think, `what IS the story here', but the overriding factor that makes it tolerable is Johnny Depp playing Tonto himself. Whenever he is on screen you just can help but be drawn into him. He is exactly as funny as you would think. He is heroic. He is amazingly talented in his craft and always visually interesting to look at as he created the character visually himself. Johnny Depp is the only real interesting character in this film that keeps you hooked.

Written by Justin Haythe (Revolutionary Road, Snitch), Ted Elliot (Legend of Zorro, Pirates Films) and Terry Rossio (Laundry, Deja Vu), the story reworks the legend a little and try's real hard to make a strong dramatic point about a man who loses his family in the name of the law to a somewhat corrupt character named Cole, played marvelously by Tom Wilkinson (Michael Clayton, Batman Begins).

Playing the title character of John Reid aka The Lone Ranger is Armie Hammer (The Social Network, Mirror, Mirror) who gives it a go at trying to be witty and funny, but his acting chops against Depp, he just can't keep up. He is a charming and tall in stature, but doesn't have the screen warmth and debonairness that this heroic character needs and was originally written like. Ruth Wilson (Saving Mr. Banks, Luther) plays his sister-in-law and the unannounced requited love of John Reid, known even to his brother, who was played quite well by James Badge Dale (Departed, Iron man 3), is almost a throw away part of the story.

Enter the sharp shooting, evil minded and fairly gross looking villain Butch Cavendish played brilliantly by William Fichtner (Contact, The Dark Knight) who is one of those actors who amazingly transforms himself into his characters. In fact it's Depp and Fichtner that make this movie worth watching. Everything else runs slow and a little pointless.

There's a lot of action, gunfights and some fairly law of physics-defying stunts and explosions that occur, but sprinkled it all with Depp's humor and Fichtner's gross evilness, and it makes it more than slightly above fantasy/believable. The vistas of the southwest desert were very well photographed and beautiful to look at. Cinematographer Bojan Bazelli (Mr. & Mrs. Smith, the Ring) did an amazing job with the photography. The film does looks great!

The other narrative thing they do is the entire history of The Lone Ranger is told through the story-telling abilities of a very old (and I thought he was a wax figure) Tonto (Depp) to a young boy in a museum like environment. So what happens?  They keep cutting back and forth, in and out of the story, to take you to various stages of the dynamic duo's initial meetings. It did get a little old after a while. Oh even Helena Bonham Carter (Harry Potter, Alice In Wonderland) has a small but definitely memorable part too!

Hans Zimmer (The Lion King, Inception) does use the famous William Tell Overture, especially at the end just a tiny bit exaggerated. Overall the kids should like it because of the action even though it is a little waited on the ""boys"" side. The love story is a little week but the thrust of the entertainment will definitely be Johnny Depp. His is a one-of-a-kind style of acting always keep you interested, I just wish the rest of the film was as fun (and as good) as he was.",1375228800,2,3860,4.750746268656717

It has all of the components that can be expected -- reasonably intricate plot, spectacular cinematography, good action scenes, quotable one-liners, and an excellent Hans Zimmer soundtrack. It also successfully follows on the Pirates of the Carribean franchise (yes, it *is* Pirates on land...did anyone seriously expect anything different?), but where Pirates 4 got tired and wan, the Lone Ranger starts afresh and better. It also adds Depp's humor (spiced up here by the no-less entertaining Armie Hammer), great acting across the board, humorous cross-genre referencing to its predecessor and co-curricular compatriots, and it doesn't slack when it comes to intellectual challenge when it comes to digesting America's uneasy history.",1375056000,8,1047,5.503105590062112

Saw it twice in 2 days. Great each time. Just went a third time and still loved it...

Engaging story, action, and casting make this my favorite movie of all time. Go see this now.... Best movie Johnny Depp has ever been in....

As much as I love this movie I will not be upset if there is not a sequel as you could not improve upon this movie. All other action adventure movies pale in comparison to this...Go see this now...",1375056000,5,517,4.309278350515464
5825049,1,B00DJYJWVW,Depp is getting way too old for these roles. At his age he should be playing gramps not action heroes. The main problem as so many have stated is that the movie wasn't sure what it wanted to be.,1375056000,7,194,4.0
5825050,2,B00DJYJWVW,"After watching its trailer, I thought it was so interesting that I went to see it in the theatre.  What a waste of money.

There are very few funny scenes even though the movie is more than 2 hours long. One of them is at the beginning where Tonto (played by Johnny Depp) was chained to the floor of a train car.

There are lots of action scenes. They're predictable, and mixed with slapstick humor. After a while, the humor becomes boring.

The special effects look great in some scenes. In other cases, they look familiar.
In short, it's not worth it.

Update August 19, 2013

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this film

Release Date: July 3, 2013
Production Budget: $215 million
Domestic gross:  $87,700,000

So, it's a gigantic flop in North America.

People have spoken. Few people liked it as other blockbusters of summer 2013 such as World War Z, Fast & Furious 6, and Despicable Me 2. Each of  them grossed $473,020,000, $741,099,000 and, $660,913,000 respectively.",1374969600,5,1011,4.752873563218391

All 10 of us have very different views on what makes a good movie, but we all liked this one!  It's a fun western that is well made and humorous.  No  strong language, no sex - it's a great family movie.  I love Johnny Depp's portrayal as Tonto.  He didn't over act or under act the part.  Incredibly well done.  To all those people who say he's not Native American, guess what!  He is!  He's part Cherokee and for this movie the Comanchee Nation also adopted him into their tribe.  That's good enough for me.  Armie Hammer was a great Lone Ranger too.  He looked the part and he has a quick, dry humor.  So much fun.  I can't wait to buy this!",1374710400,41,754,4.174825174825175
5825054,5,B00DJYJWVW,"I learned a long time ago that movie reviewers often are subjected to the movies they review via projectors with burned out bulbs and no sound system.  Very much the case with this one.  The reviews I read said that the movie suffered an identity crisis, shifting between serious story and comedy.  Had they paid attention to the first two minutes of the film they might have noticed that they were being told the movie is a spoof.  Boy enters Wild West Show, sees Bison in his natural habitat, then Bear in his natural habitat, then The Noble Savage in his natural habitat.  The message could not have been any clearer, but it went completely over the reviewers' heads.  The movie plays out accordingly and may go down in history as one of the great spoofs of all time.  There are some very dark moments: one ensures that you will have no trouble taking sides against the bad guy (but is only suggested, and not nearly as gory as the reviews made it out to be), and another makes sure that though we laugh at the rest of the movie, we do not forget the very real horrors perpetrated against Native Americans during the conquest of the American West.  Mostly, though, it was laughs, and laugh I did. As I sat in one of AMC's overstuffed theater chairs, I laughed almost continuously as one western movie cliche after another got turned on its head. It has everything from a tree-climbing horse to a prostitute with a loaded ivory leg. The last 20 minutes alone are worth the price of admission with Rube Goldberg-like antics with a runaway train, but it's also hard to beat watching Johnny Depp walk through the entire movie with a dead crow on his head.  It should have been reviewed by more intelligent and perceptive reviewers (some sense of humor would have helped) and it should have had better attendance than it did.  It's one of the must-see movies of the summer.",1374624000,11,1871,4.541666666666667

These days people don't know the Lone Ranger, and even my children, who are now 30's, weren't familiar with the series.  We all went to see this movie together, and we ALL enjoyed it very much.  In fact, the entire audience in the movie theater clapped at the end of the movie - it was that good!

5825066,1,B00DJYJWVW,"I watched, I believe the complete series of the Lone Ranger as a Child.  The 2013 movie was insulting, insulting to the honor of Tonto, as an American Indian as well as the Lone Ranger.  The story is about the Long Ranger, not Johhny Depp's rendition of an Indian partner of an Important hero.  I have no idea what the director had in mind producing this terrible movie. Why did they destroy the iconic cultural memories of past generations?  It was a 150 million dollar loss because it is not honor a great series that meant a great deal to the baby boomer population. It is like Hollywood is spitting on the shows of the past.

In interviews Johnny Depp's talks about meeting some American Indians and trying his best to honor them.  I wonder why, since there are so many great American Indian actors why did Johnny Depp played this part.

The Long Ranger was never a joke, it was a serious program to entertain child and gain positive life messages, something that the original Star Trek did, in their series.

Who ever came up with this idea and wrote the script should be ashamed of themselves.  Plus, I surmise they are out of a job, permanently.",1374105600,9,1152,4.5

Then she said ""we need to get the DVD because I am going to watch it EVERY DAY!""

5825068,3,B00DJYJWVW,"I can understand how The Lone Ranger got its bad reviews. It's either an action-adventure reboot of the classic television and radio serials whose tender, dramatic moments drag it down, or its a dramatic comedy whose action moments take away from its story. The film's plot hits the ground running in the first ten minutes, then drags on endlessly for the next eighty. In spite of this, it's not half as bad as the bad reviews make it out to be.

Johnny Depp, a target of most of the bad hype surrounding the film, is surprisingly in top form. However, at times it seems like Captain Jack Sparrow is walking around in the wild west with a crow on his head, rather than Jim Reid's faithful partner. In addition to this, Depp's presence is so overwhelmingly commanding that he often drowns out the ""main"" character, played by Armie Hammer. Speaking of Hammer, his portrayal of Jim Reid is a little shaky. Reid starts the movie as a lawyer, who is later deputized as a Texas Ranger. Being a DA in the late 1800s, Reid has very little experience with the actual enforcement of the law, including firing a gun. His origin story (taken at face value rather than compared to the vast number of television and radio episodes) is interesting to see unfold.

The movie's story, both the big and the small, have little contradictions that seem as if they were put there for the sole purpose of seeing if the audience is paying attention. The story is being told to a young boy by Tonto, who is found in a carnival exhibit of the old west in 1933, a good 60 years after it happened. Yet there are many parts of the story for which Tonto himself was not present, including at least a few hours he was unconscious. As he begins his story, he makes a trade for the boy's peanuts in a red and white bag. Later in the film, he trades the red and white bag to a man he buried in the 1890s.

In spite of everything, as long as you keep your expectations low and don't think too hard about the little contradictions, you will walk away somewhat satisfied.",1374019200,5,2035,4.421333333333333

I went into this expecting an awful movie based on what viewers & critics both have been saying about The Lone Ranger & I was pleasantly surprised.  Is it Oscar worthy?  No, but so what.

Not exactly an AFI Top 100 list, I know, but excluding Man of Steel, which was a phenomenal movie, I liked The Lone Ranger better than any of them.  It's Gore Verbrinski's best film since the original Pirates of the Caribbean & it's Depp's best in a long time.  The last 2 Pirate films, Dark Shadows, & Alice in Wonderland were all horrible.

The serious parts of the movie kept me from getting up and leaving. Things like Tonto and Butch Cavendish being prisoners on the train, the ambush scene and other scenes in the serious side could have made it the greatest Lone Ranger movie ever made. But the silly attempts at being funny ruined it. The writers kept saying they were going to do it in keeping with the time honored tradition of The Lone Ranger but they destroyed it. The Lone Ranger did not have a ""thing"" for his brothers wife. She was coming west with her son when the Texas Rangers were ambushed. She was 6 to 8 years older the her husbands younger brother. There was too much slapstick attempted humor. I grew up in final years of Brace Beemer and the entire run with Clayton Moore and John Hart. Jay Silverheels is 25000000 better Tonto the actor who portrayed Tonto.  The actor was Butch Cavendish was as good as Christopher Lloyd who played Cavendish in the 1980 failed film. They should be made to reshoot the film and leave the silly immature material. Just look at how the box office is losing money with this film and this will tell how poor a quality the film with its silliness is costing them. Amazon is making me rate it 1 star. It really should be rated minus-1, 000 000 000 000 000 000 000. stars.",1373932800,12,1428,4.450381679389313
5825073,5,B00DJYJWVW,"It seems to me that critics had a vendetta against this movie even before it hit the theater.  With their pithy and scathing remarks about how bad or boring they think it was, viewers are assuming that it's not worth seeing and then never formulate their own opinion on it.  I for one found it to be one of the most enjoyable movies of the year.  There is very little CGI used which is refreshing after all the movies we've seen lately that seem hell bent on seeing just how much of the film can be created on a computer.  The stunts are real, the train wrecks are real, and the scenery is beautiful as it was shot in the Southwestern states (Utah, Arizona, Texas, California, New Mexico, and Colorado.)  Armie Hammer is very charming actor and I hope to see him in more things.  He made a wonderful Lone Ranger, starting out as a man of the law before realizing how corrupt the world can be and turning outlaw.  Johnny Depp was fun to watch as Tonto.  He has the remarkable ability to be both goofy and nonsensical and then turn around into someone who is deadly serious about what needs to be done.  The supporting cast all did a wonderful job as well.  When I watch movies I try to imagine the cast filming scenes and interacting with one another and The Lone Ranger feels like a movie that the actors all had a great time filming.  That kind of camaraderie presents itself and makes a difference in the end.  I loved this movie and is one of my top three favorites this summer.  I looked forward to it for a long time and I for one was not disappointed at all.  I am genuinely sad, in fact, that The Lone Ranger didn't do better at the box office and get better reviews.  I can say however that the people I've talked to who have seen it absolutely loved it.  This proves to me that some movie viewers are too dependent on critic reviews and won't take the time to see the movie and determine what they think of it for themselves.  I hope that it does well with DVD/Blu Ray sales and that perhaps it will pick up a bit at the box office.  I was hoping that we might get a Lone Ranger 2 someday.

It tried to set up a plot but with all the whining from the so called Lone Ranger it made it impossible to even entreat this as a story about him. The producers were so afraid that the movie would win a RAZZIE AWARD for BLAH picture of the year they wrapped the entire around TONTO, go figure!

The hero is trying to protect a love interest. I will admit that Jack Sparrow, to me,was a bit more charming but the style was the same. If you liked ""Pirates"" you can't help but enjoy this film. This is not like the traditional Lone Ranger productions of the past. How can todays fan take a western hero who wears a mask seriously unless he is created by Marvel Comics.

Instead, I went with diminished expectations -- and left the theater with a big smile on my face and wanting to see it again. Which I did a week later, and enjoyed it just as much, maybe more since I was able to watch for little tidbits planted by the film makers.

It's flawed for sure -- could easily have been shorter by 20 minutes. But it's got heart, well-motivated characters worth rooting for (and against), and -- unlike most big sci-fi and comic-book films these days -- the action sequences had wit and inventiveness sadly lacking in recent movies like STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS and the grimly-boring MAN OF STEEL. LONE RANGER's special effects served the story instead of overwhelming it.

THE LONE RANGER was almost everything I'd hoped it would be...except a commercial success. The quirky relationship between Tonto and the Lone Ranger made me want to see more stories about this unusual duo. Alas, a sequel is highly unlikely, and that's a shame.",1373932800,8,1055,4.823204419889502

Here's a clue, critics:  A lot of boys and girls sitting in front of black and white television sets in Texas had DNA from both The Lone Ranger and Tonto. Deep down we already suspected what the movie up and said out loud:  Civil War profiteers from up north financed the genocide against the Plains Indians, and many Texas Rangers tried to stop it.

This is where the movie fails miserably. And this is why I hate being forced into a rating system. You see, the reason I was able to enjoy the movie so much was because I was prepped by all the trailers that this is not really a Lone Ranger movie. I mean seriously did any trailer actually look like this was going to be an epic story of The Lone Ranger? NO! Just like another reviewer mentioned how this and The Green Hornet turned the main character into a fool I was noticing the same thing, but at least this movie had a lot more imagination. And unlike the Green Hornet movie which the humor for the most part made me groan, the humor in this movie caused me to laugh out loud quite often. Here's just a little (spoiler warning). Early in the film John Reid is riding on a train, and a little girl, roughly 3 years old accidentally drops her doll. When John picks it up to give it back he naively wants to play catch toss back, but the doll gets sucked out the train window. Needless to say the little girl starts balling her eyes out. Now this is where the modern day movie writer has no clue how to seize an opportune moment and truly touch the heart of the viewer. I thought it would have been so moving, and so beautiful at the end of the movie if the Lone Ranger had somehow found that doll and brought it back to the little girl, with a family member saying ""Who was that masked man?"" then we'd hear ""HI-YO SILVER! AWAY!"" as He and Tonto ride off into the sunset and the Lone Ranger theme kicked in. But unfortunately that scene never happened.  In closing I would just like to say, if Hollywood gets the idea to actually do a respectable Lone Ranger movie, who ever they cast to play The Lone Ranger it should be kept a secret. It should be someone famous AND right for the part. All his John Reid pre Lone Ranger scenes should be either from the back of his head or his face shadowed in darkness. The Opening and Ending credits should only have ""?"" for his name. That way the general public at large can say ""WHO WAS THAT MASKED MAN?""",1373760000,7,2407,4.24400871459695
5825084,1,B00DJYJWVW,"This is the biggest disappointment in years.  It follows The Green Hornet model of taking a serious hero and turning him into a fool for comic effect.  In this case, the reasoning went, let's right the wrong of the stereotype native American as side-kick by making the Ranger look stupid by comparison.

Just take the last scene as an example.  Silver rares up, the Lone Ranger shouts the iconic, ""Hi-yo, Silver, away,"" and the camera turns to Johnny Depp who deadpan reacts ""Never do that again,"" to which the Lone Ranger responds with an embarrassed sheepish grin.

Add to that a massacre of a tribe by Cavalry Gatling guns while the Ranger is blindfolded and comically oblivious to the carnage around him as he's whisked off on a railroad cart.  Again, stupid and inept:  I mean the Lone Ranger but that could apply to the movie as a whole.

5825086,4,B00DJYJWVW,"The story is told as a flashback from 1933 with an aged Tonto (Johnny Depp) being a circus Indian attraction. In this saga, the Lone Ranger (Armie Hammer) is a straight, rather green marshal who seeks justice and revenge for the death of his brother. He is the reluctant partner of Tonto whose ""mind is broken."" The two form a comedy duo as they go after the bad guys.

The plot was secondary to the characters. The film was enjoyable, but not entertaining enough to sit comfortably for over two hours. I felt I sat there for 2 hours of character and plot build-up for one lone climatic William Tell Overture scene. The film lacked a certain cohesion and contained anachronisms. For instance the Sears watch given to a young Tonto prior to 1868 was impossible as the first Sears watch sold was 1886.

Great popcorn film. Don't expect an epic. We do find out what Kemosabe means and it was not what my mother told me (king of s***), although Tonto could have lied. There was one scene which could have vindicated mom.

5825087,3,B00DJYJWVW,"With ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" director Gore Verbinski and actor Johnny Depp on the job, no one should have expected 2013's ""The Lone Ranger"" to be a straight retelling of the 1960's television series. ""The Lone Ranger"" is an over the top reboot that mixes funny, dramatic and mysterious in uneven proportions. This reviewer saw it with an audience that laughed out loud at some of the funny parts and cheered when the Lone Ranger rode to the rescue in the finale.

The story is told by an aged Tonto to a wide-eyed young boy in a Lone Ranger costume. Extended flashbacks provide an origin for Tonto, a Comanche alienated from his tribe, and for John Reid, a lawyer who returns to his Texas hometown just in time to be deputized as a Ranger and ride into a lethal ambush with his brother. John (Armie Hammer) survives the ambush, thanks to a mysterious white horse and to Tonto (Johnny Depp in spirit warrior garb), who believes the Ranger will be his companion in a quest for justice. The Ranger will require some persuasion from Tonto to take on that role, as the two face a vicious outlaw gang and some corrupt officials. At stake, among other things, is the fate of John's sister in law (and former girlfriend) and her son.

The movie has some spectacular action sequences, and there is a solid supporting cast. It does run long, and some of the gags are hit or miss. The tone of the movie veers between comedy and drama and farce; a promising love story doesn't come to anything. Recommended as an afternoon's entertainment, as long as you aren't expecting a traditional Lone Ranger story.",1373673600,35,1595,4.612676056338028

Shame on you Disney, Johnny Depp, and the producers for taking great characters and portraying them as moronic buffoons.

Watching this abortion that, on reflection, should not have been made at all, was like having the memory of a great meal only to have it totally spoiled by eating a replica that was rancid. All this put me off my food entirely for a few weeks.

5825092,4,B00DJYJWVW,"""The Lone Ranger"" is a Wild West genre film derived from the popular 1940s and 1950s television series.

The Lone Ranger franchise has been previously attempted in movie format with some hits and misses. This most recent offering with Johnny Depp as Tonto and Armie Hammer as John Reid has an energy all of its own and somewhat breaks away from the Clayton Moore brand Lone Ranger by generally avoiding catchphrases he made famous and even deals with them humorously.

Depp provides a mystical Tonto and Hammer exudes plenty of enthusiasm as Reid. Both characters have had their belief of fair living and justice violated by corruption and it becomes their quest to avenge these wrong doings.

The cinematography provides some breathtaking scenes and out of all the Lone Ranger works this version probably contains heavier violence than the others, however the narrative contains some clever and entertaining moments which balances out the movie.

They completely missed the mark IMHO.

5825095,4,B00DJYJWVW,"To each his own. I went to this film to be entertained & was not disappointed in the least. My recollection of the original Lone Ranger is sketchy at best as I was very young during it's tv run. Basically I recall ""hi ho Silver away""  & the theme song so my expectations for a  remake were non-existant. In fact,  the ""lone ranger""part finally made sense to me.
  It was a period piece set in a very realistic albeit Disneyfied old west. The production values were immense as was the scenery filmed on location in New Mexico, Utah & ?Arizona. The story was well told from a perspective similar to that of Little Big Man. Dialogue sometimes fell flat in spots when humor was intended but it was humorous. The plight of our Native Americans was addressed all too realistically.
  It was a good old fashioned Western with plenty of period appropriate action & the penultimate train scene had me on the edge of my seat almost wanting to cheer while the familiar theme music played throughout. The Hans Zimmer score underscored the film beautifully.  Good guys were good, Bad guys were bad & there was even the dancehall girl with her heart in the right place.
  All said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film & hope the actors reprise their roles in a second installment.  Can't wait for the BluRay/ DVD release. Hope it is loaded with special features.",1373500800,7,1342,4.573221757322176

Does the dead bird really have to work it's way into the script throughout the remainder of the movie?  He repeatedly feeds it.  It gets shot by a stray bullet.  It is used as a prop in a birdcage.  It is shown to be a symbol of tragedy in young Tonto's life.  Then there's Silver the horse who can climb to the top of barns/trees,  and leap off of tall buildings onto moving trains.  When things get slow,  the Captain Jack Sparrow in warpaint ""kookiness"" begins.  You can see the entire plot unfold a mile away.  How did this happen?  I thought this was supposed to be about the Lone Ranger.  Instead, it became the story of Tonto told through Depps ""Kooky"" vision, stupid pet tricks, excessive violence, CGI explosions, and poor plot development.",1373500800,28,1050,4.449735449735449
5825097,3,B00DJYJWVW,"Saw this film last night, it was enjoyable but far from great.  The main problem as so many have stated is that it wasn't sure what it wanted to be: a serious western or a western comedy.  Sure there were very serious and violent scenes such as the ambushing of the Texas Rangers by the Cavendish gang (very well done) and the slaughter of a tribe of attacking Indians by an army Gatling Gun.  (We are absolutely meant to root for the Indians here.)  Still the film has too much comedy particularly the way Tonto talks to the Lone Ranger and the supernatural abilities of Silver, the horse.
Depp is great as Tonto, appearing a bit, as so many have stated, as an Indian Captain Jack Sparrow.  However Armie Hammer is a basic non-entity as the Ranger.  He is one of a young group of actors that I have difficulty telling apart. (Armie Hammer, Channing Tatum, ???)  While I did love tv westerns growing up, I have very little specific memories of The Lone Ranger.  I am not sure whether he ever killed anyone with his famous silver bullets.  Here he never shoots anyone.  Even when the evil Cavendish is finally killed, it is through a series of cicumstances set up by the Ranger and Tonto, not the Ranger himself.  Furthermore, the Ranger prevents many attempts to kill Cavendish by Tonto, just so that Cavendish can hang lawfully.  This gets silly after a while as Cavendish constantly escapes to perform more mayhem.  Truthfully, this Lone Ranger just isn't very smart.  This is Depp's and Tonto's film.
Weeks before this film opened, the Hollywood trades started printing stories about how this would be a financial disaster for Disney, this year's ""John Carter.""  The film critic's jumped on the bandwagon with their ridiculous one star reviews.  Suddenly we have a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" and the film is bombing.  They tried to do the same thing to a lesser extent with ""Man of Steel.""  The web-site Rotten Tomatoes.com had an average positive review among film critics of 67%.  Yet the movie goers polled gave the film an A minus.
Look, ""The Lone Ranger"" is no ""Man of Steel.""  However it still deserved a better fate.  The long action scene at the end involving two runaway trains is amazing.  As stated, it is not great but not terrible either.  Perhaps today's audiences do not love westerns like I do, I have no doubt we will not be seeing a ""Lone Ranger 2.""

The movie is very far from being realistic, almost a cartoon in the ""real"" world (think the Road Runner).  After reading all of the critics' reviews I went into this movie not expecting much.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a typical summer block-buster.  The movie did run a little long.

Johnny Depp is quirky as normal, Armie Hammer was a little stiff though.",1373500800,3,467,4.703703703703703
5825099,2,B00DJYJWVW,"There's no question that ""The Lone Ranger"" is exactly the movie director Gore Verbinski and the Disney organization set out to make. It is very much taken from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" playbook. There are some funny gags throughout the movie, as well as spectacular runaway train sequences at the beginning and end, ensuring full employment for the stuntmen's union. Johnny Depp is very funny as Tonto--nobody does a better deadpan stare than he does--and there are good supporting performances by Helena Bonham Carter, William Fichtner and Tom Wilkinson. Also, the horse playing Silver is the best equine thespian since Lee Marvin's nag in ""Cat Ballou.""

Unfortunately, all praise must end here. The middle of the story sags, largely because Verbinski & Co. care far more about their set pieces than about creating a coherent story or consistent characters. The real victim here is Armie Hammer in the title role. Hammer is a likable and accomplished actor, but Verbinski gives him no role to play. Essentially, the scriptwriters change the Lone Ranger's character to fit whatever they want him to be or do at the time. At times he's a goody-twoshoes and total klutz; at others he's unbelievably mean and unlikable, particularly in one sequence where the Ranger and Tonto are buried up to their necks by the Comanches. Only at the end is he truly a hero, and it just doesn't fit with what we've learned about the character up to then.

The framing device Verbinski creates--about a little boy encountering the aged Tonto at a Wild West show in 1933--also doesn't work. It's confusing and adds nothing to the story, and would have been better left on the cutting-room floor.

Verbinski recycles material wholesale from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean""  movies, even to the point of having one of the bad guys dressing up in drag. Apparently he and the producers (of whom Depp was one) were counting on audiences being satisfied with a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" sequel in cowboy costume.

The Lone Ranger - as played by Arnie Hammer  -- seems to need not only a Shave but some therapy.  There was never a lot of plot with the radio / TV Lone Ranger but he was always a hero supported by his faithful Indian companion Tonto  The movie version is a politically correct view of the Lone Ranger which transforms him from a gun wielding ex-lawman into a gun hating lawyer determined to do good -- if possible with the aid of his intellectually superior companion.  That companion is TONTO -- made up to look more like a VooDoo priest than any Native American.  In fact I am beginning to wonder if you stripped the weird makeup from Johnny Depp's many characters could he actually act?

There is a little required political stuff but overall this is just another shoot'em up with little plot.  The opening train sequence seems to go on forever followed by the posse pursuing the escaped prisoners.  The soon to be ""Lone Ranger"" escapes the gory massacre and is saved by the ""Spirit Horse"" and Tonto.  Tonto gives more lectures than a college professor and is --as usual overacted by Depp.  Feeding corn to the bird in his headdress I presume is Depp's idea of acting..

There's the wise-cracking pair of good guys, but the wise-cracks seemed out of place amid the more somber notes. The Ranger/Tonto pairing never seemed to gel, and the horse (""Something wrong with that horse"") could have been more special or less, but came across as strange, but not strange enough for that touch of supernatural.

The story starts at a Wild West exhibit. A young masked boy in cowboy gear sees an Indian in the exhibit.
The Indian starts to tell him about his story - him and a white man - the Lone Ranger. The
boy is enthralled--we are waiting for the actual action to start...

When the actual movie started, I was waiting and waiting for action. There is some and a
very gory scene at the start.
The first half of the movie dragged, albeit telling the story's premise; loong and fairly dull.

 Reid, then a lawyer, then appointed a Ranger, thought the law was the only way to have peace and rule the land.
He was wrong.

The story progresses that not everything is black and white in law or the Old West.
The Spiritual White Stallion appears and Reid is chosen to help Tonto, whether he like it or not!

The Utah scenery is breathtaking. Worth seeing the movie for that.

The storyline tends to drag along for quite a while somewhere between wanting to go get something from the concession
stand and/or bathroom break....the magic appears!!!!

if you wait long enough,  the true Lone Ranger and Tonto emerge--along with the music-- you will be cheering and applauding.
Stay or watch until the complete ending credits; most have more 'action' under the credits!!!!!!  You are excited and clap and cheer at
the action and suspense. Depp steals scenes often, but he's one of the executive producers and
really cute, so he can. Then thinking back, the latter half of the movie makes up for the first, so I changed to 4 stars.

Tonto  finishes telling the boy his story and the little guy can't believe that it was truly real, but he is affected by the story, and puts on
his mask again.

The last half makes up for the first, but I gave it 3 stars initially because the wait was too long, and 4 stars for the experience and fun
and clapping and cheering!

BTW Trivia -- For those of you who are not comic book aficionados, the little boy from the exhibit, is a descendant of  Reid, and he grows up to be The Green Hornet-
A good guy who always has his mask on...

If they have a partial DVD of the latter half of the movie, I'll buy it -- but going through the first half IS worth the excitement of the latter, so maybe I may!

I never felt bored, but I did keep wondering who the audience would be. Professional critics have pretty much ripped the movie to shreds, complaining that the tone is all over the place. That point is well-taken, but I actually kind of liked it once I reconciled myself to its profoundly weird mix of brilliantly-crafted action comedy, surreal jokes and melancholy.

This origin story uses the framing device of Tonto as an elderly sideshow attraction in a Depression-era carnival. Tonto looks remarkably like Keith Richards as he sits next to some taxidermy buffalo in a diorama with a label ""The Native American in his natural habitat."" At the request of a young ""Lone Ranger"" fan visiting the exhibit, Tonto looks back and tells how the Lone Ranger became the Loan Ranger. In 1869, John Reid, an eastern-educated, newly minted lawyer, returns to his home town of Colby on the edge of the white frontier in Texas. Tensions between white settlers and the Comanche tribe are high. Latham Cole, the local head of the Transcontinental Railroad now under construction, seems a benevolent steward of white progress. Reid soon has his naive schoolbook notions of justice turned upside down as the brutal outlaw Butch Cavendish escapes from the train carrying him to Colby for trial and wreaks havoc on the surrounding countryside.

""The Lone Ranger"" features a breathtaking comic action sequence for its finale, but the preceding two hours must be about the oddest mix of brutality, sadness and humor ever filmed. Among other things, Butch Cavendish cuts out the heart of Reid's brother and takes a bite out of it while the man is still alive. Contemplating whether to make a hopeless last stand against the railroad's violation of their treaty rights, the Comanche chief says, ""We are already ghosts."" The Comanche and their horses ride into slaughter against the Union Army that is called in to ""defend"" the railroad. Personal greed rather than grandiose notions of ""unifying the nation"" motivate the railroad barons. Meanwhile, Reid engages in a great deal--too much, really--of meet-cute banter with Tonto, an outcast from the Comanche who takes Reid under his wing. With Johnny Depp as adapt at physical and verbal comedy as ever and some other fun gags, we laugh. However, we, the adult audience, cannot escape our knowledge, regularly reinforced by the framing device, that whatever ""justice"" Reid as the Lone Ranger and Tonto might attain means nothing. Big business will win, Native American communities will be left near extinction and permanently marginalized, and nature will remain out of balance. We, in our greed, will eventually cannibalize the very things we need to survive.

Parents, this violent film with its harsh depiction of white settlement of the frontier is a far cry from the cartoony, kid-friendly ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. It's carefully edited enough that the most gruesome fruits of violence are implied but not seen, but  little imagination is needed to envision the next picture.  History buffs, the movie's inaccuracies may drive you crazy. Horse lovers, there are many beautiful, talented horses, but also a scene of brutal slaughter of horses.

The thing is, ""The Lone Ranger"" is beautifully shot, well-acted in a melodramatic way that suits the material, and although overlong, holds the viewers' interest from start to finish. Unlike many action movies, the plot holds together. The movie it most reminded me of was Buster Keaton's silent classic, ""The General."" The thing is, you don't expect a violent existential meditation, with jokes, from ""the team that brought you Pirates of the Caribbean.""",1373241600,10,3760,5.105691056910569
5825113,4,B00DJYJWVW,"I thought this film was absolutely fantastic! I was born in the 80's, so I never saw the original television version. That being said, the movie did an excellent job at keeping my attention, never knowing what's going to happen next. The humor of Johnny Depp's character, Tonto, was brilliant! I caught myself laughing out loud numerous times.

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought the story was a bit weak, as was Armie Hammer's portrayal of the Lone Ranger. I think a bigger name star such as Matt Damon or Paul Walker would have gone over better with the audience and probably would have saved this film at the box-office.",1373241600,6,645,4.560344827586207

I""m a baby boomer, that grew up watching Clayton Moore portray the masked man, and  I""ve been a big fan of  the lone ranger since I was a child, I had been hopeing,  hearing that disney bought the rights, to the lone ranger, that they would bring it back, with all the good stuff, it portrayed all those years ago, to the now and future generations, I think the kids of today, could truly use a role model with all the garbage available to them.. well I went to see this movie with a open mind, really wanting to see what magic, disney could create, to bring the masked man, back to his former glory, well the first thing I saw was a old indian with a dead chicken on his head, telling stories to a young child..........and from there on, the story just went down hill!!.......
it just made a mockery of the franchise, as far as I""m concerened.........the only saving grace, are the special effects, which truly are wonderful, I predict, this will be a big bust for disney, and according to the latest reviews, and box office reciepts

5825115,3,B00DJYJWVW,"I just have to write a review about this movie...  I grew up with the Lone Ranger on radio, and then on TV, and in the movies. When it came on TV, and into the movie theaters in my childhood, NEVER did I ever have to cover my eyes to avoid seeing scenes that were so brutal that I felt like I was in a horror movie...which I would NEVER want to see, and which I thought I could choose not to see. When I read reviews about violent scenes in this movie, I assumed it was only referring to the usual western fight scenes.  I never dreamed that it would include implying that an old lady's finger would be cut off to steal her diamond ring, cutting out a man's heart and eating it, or murdering the entire tribe of Indians (I expected a happy ending with Tonto and his tribe!)!!! That is so sick!!  With the Lone Ranger shows and movies I saw as a child, I NEVER once had to cover my eyes because of the fear that I would see a horrible, upsetting scene of such violence that should never be associated with such a beloved character!  I saw the movie yesterday, and I tried to ignore those extremely upsetting scenes; but, this morning I woke up thinking about it, and I was in tears because of what Disney has done to defile the precious memories that those of us who grew up with the Lone Ranger have had, which this movie has stolen from this generation.

My grandson is supposed to be taken to see that movie today, but, I am going to warn my daughter against it.  This World has become so sick and violent, and our children have to deal with enough real extreme violence and upset without having to see it on the big screen in a Disney movie where it should NOT be!!!! THIS is part of the reason so many of our children are growing up without the sensitivity toward others that we have had in generations past. I am so deeply disappointed that the name of Disney can no longer be counted on for only wholesome family entertainment!!! I do not want my grandchildren to be so desensitized that they can sit through such violence and inhumane movie scenes without cringing and being sickened by them!!! The very sad thing is that this movie could have been an awesome classic if it were not for the extreme violence that was totally unnecessary, and which defiled what the Lone Ranger stories gifted to my generation,the previous generation,and should still have for those of us who grew up with the REAL one, and what should still be for the present and future generations!!!  It is a total shame!  Other than that, the rest of the movie was great. I really enjoyed the wonderful humor.  Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp were awesome together, and they did an awesome job of portraying the characters.  It was only the defilement of the original story that I intensely object to.  This movie should be rated R because of the extremely sickening scenes!  Better yet they should be removed so that this movie could be the classic it should have been!",1373241600,8,2944,4.381651376146789
5825116,5,B00DJYJWVW,"What a surprise!  From the previews I was worried it was going to be a farce and make fun of one of my childhood heroes.  Beautiful music, the story was funny and yet warm.  Acting and Directing were perfect.  I was born in 1952, so I grew up watching The Lone Ranger, Zorro, Robin Hood, Sky King, and Peter Gunn.  Is this just like the Radio and TV Shows, No.  Is this story one that would have been told in the 30's or the 50's, No; but then it`s not being written for the audience of those times.  I found this telling of the Lone Ranger and Tonto to be understandable to me with my memories from the 50's and understandable to the 6 year old and 8 year old boys who were sitting next to me.  They were as enchanted with the movie as I was.  This is kind of movie that I want my grandchildren and great-grandchildren to see.  It shows that heroes are made out of regular people, unexpected people. It bridges my youth to theirs, it creates interest in our history, and it is a heck of a good time!

7/14/13
Addendum: I find that even the most careful and cautious parents have a hard time keeping some violence away from children.  Most children go to preschool or kindergarten where pinching, biting and paste or crayon hogging happens, no matter how expensive the school is.  If you have a family of various ages it is hard to keep exposure from happening.  I think that most violence seen by children & teens shows a lot of action, (shooting, kicking, stabbing, punching), where no one gets hurt or dead, or you just hit reset and they all get up and start again.  And we all know that children are the first ones to pick up on the subtle violence of arguments and verbal manipulation that happen in life.  What I liked about the violence in this movie was that it showed the consequences of the violence.  People who got shot were hurt or died.  Bullies were not the heroes, and shown to be shallow thinking and feeling.  Today with the gangs and peer pressure worse than I ever had to face, I think bullies should not be idols.  As a nurse, I've had to take care of children and teens who have shot, stabbed or beaten each other because they thought it would be a thrill, and that they would not be hurt by it.  Sorry I went to the dark place for a minute.  Anyway it is up to each parent to decide what each of their children are ready to see.

As for the length of the movie: 2 1/2 hours is long for anyone's bladder to be folded up, in even the most generous movie theater seat.  The children sitting next to me were not mine, but they had a very smart papi, he gave the kids a 4 ounce drink with a lid and straw, and half a small bag of popcorn, as soon as the doors opened, then when the lights went down and the previews started he took them to the bathroom.  The 6yr old went from his chair to his dads lap a couple of times, but the movie held his attention the entire time.  He was a delight to sit next to, even when he spilt his popcorn prior to the movie.

A point I never touched on before, as person of Swedish, Irish & Iroquois descent, I had no problem with J. Depp Acting the role of a Native American.  I also liked the Charlie Chan movies where a swede played the lead.  I didn't cast the movies, would I do it differently, who cares what I would do, I'm a nurse not a movie maker.  Would the movie have been made at all or as well with a lesser known star?  Was the acting good, that is what matters to me, and my answer is yes he made me like Tonto, very much.",1373241600,21,3489,4.124444444444444
5825117,5,B00DJYJWVW,This movie is awesome. the lone ranger rules. got to hand it to Disney they never make bad movies. but I will have to admit that this was pretty violent for a Disney movie. it wasn't bad just never thought i'd see that much violence in a Disney movie. but I was glad they made it. this was a movie in the making for like almost 20 years and Disney finally got the rights to do it. so i'm going to let the little violence go. to me there is no such thing as a bad Disney movie. I thought that armie and johnny were great together. johnny was good as tonto and armie was good as lone ranger.

I liked the fact that the Lone Ranger was costumed in traditional clothes instead of some weird costume, and Tonto was in traditional Indian clothes of the time period. My understanding from reading about the movie that the director went to a western Indian tribe to research the correct clothing that Tonto would have worn for the time period (1869) that the movie takes place, so I don't understand other people complaining about his outfit in the movie. I thought everyone's outfits fit the time period of the movie perfect.

5825120,2,B00DJYJWVW,"The Lone Ranger is a movie I've been looking forward to since I first heard that the masked western hero would be brought back to the big screen. My wife and I just came back from seeing the New Disney/Brukheimer Lone Ranger and boy was I disappointed.

The movie stars Armie Hammer (great-grandson of billionaire Armand Hammer and movie/publishing mogul Michael Armand Hammer) as John Reid, a morally upright lawyer returned to Texas from the big city where he studied law. He's set to become the new prosecutor, bringing justice to his old home town. But the train carrying him back to Colby, Texas is also carrying two prisoners: outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and Comanche Indian Tonto (Johnny Depp). With the help of someone who hid a gun in the floor of the prison transport car, Cavendish manages a bloody escape. John Reid incompetently tries to stop the escape, and nearly gets himself and Tonto killed. Butch flees into the wilderness with a gang of vicious killers. Dan Reid, John's brother and the local sheriff, forms a posse to go after them. John volunteers to join the posse but refuses to carry a gun (what good is an unarmed rider in a posse chasing vicious killers?). The posse is betrayed and every last member killed. John Reid is shot and apparently resurrected by Tonto and a white Spirit Horse. Tonto make him a mask from his brother's vest and tries to convince him that his destiny is to become an instrument of justice. John Reid and Tonto track down Cavendish, who also killed Tonto's tribe. The young lawyer prevents the Indian from taking revenge, but when he delivers Cavendish to the authorities, it's John Reid who finds himself running from corrupt authorities. John must take up the mask and take justice into his own hand.

While this movie had a lot going for it, it fell short on so many levels. Here are my main criticisms:

(1) The story....The Lone Ranger is told as a series of flashbacks with an aged Tonto (working in a carnival) telling the story to a little boy dressed as the Lone Ranger. I can only think of two movies where this device worked, Little Big Man and Citizen Cane. This movie was no Little Big Man nor was it Citizen Cane. The flashback as story sequencing just didn't work. Later still, the movie included a flashback within a flashback (a device I've only seen used in the terrible Dragon Wars).

(2) The humor...In this movie humor was pretty much limited to the slapstick kind. Given the types of laughs the writers and director went for, this movie could have starred Kevin James and Will Farrell. When looking back at the combination of slapstick and violence, the movie that Lone Ranger seems most comprable to his Seth Rogan's Green Hornet. But the violence in Green Hornet is less disturbing. I found the combination of slapstick humor and gratuitous violence a little disconcerting. I love a good laugh but this movie mixed slapstick tomfoolery with wholesale massacres.

(3) Violence...first of all I'm not one of those people who decry movie violence. If you're playing The Magnificent Seven, Reservoir Dogs or Wild Geese on the big screen I'll be the first one to come over for movie night. But there was a certain cognitive dissonance to the violence in this movie that I bothered me. Extreme violence is depicted and even more is insinuated. An entire posse is gunned down, the sheriff's heart is cut out, and the Comanche army is annihilated. Yet the Lone Ranger barely shoots his gun and never actually shoots anyone. For some reason it's OK for him to crush a villain under a train but intolerable for him to shoot a villain even when that villain is about to murder an innocent.

(4) Geography...the movie takes place in Texas. But much of the scenery is clearly Utah or Colorado. Do they not know what Texas looks like (no jagged mountains), or did they think that guys on foot and horseback would wander out of Texas and into the Rockies in just a few hours?

(5) Guns...If you've ever gone target shooting, you know that putting a bullet in a target is a lot harder than it looks, even with a modern target pistol. Using a .45 caliber single action pistol is multiples harder. John Reid returns to Texas as the anti-gun lovechild of Michael Bloomberg and Rosie O'Donnell. He doesn't believe in guns and hasn't held a gun in 8 years. There's no place for men who carry guns in the new law abiding west. When deputized as a peace officer, he refuses to carry a gun...and he's going after a gang of murderers. Yet by the second time he picks up a gun he's making impossible shots from the back of a moving horse. And ne never runs out of bullets and never has to reload.

(6) Casting...The one thing this movie had going for it was Johnny Depp; he did a great job as Tonto even if it did cost a Native American actor a job. If I were casting this movie I would have cast Adam Beach (but I would have made a different movie). Because his dialogue was so bad, I really can't tell if Armie Hammer is capable of acting. Hammer didn't carry the role but the writers didn't give him much to work with. Ruth Wilson plays John's sister-in-law and an object of lust by the villain. She seemed to be making the ducklip-face throughout the movie.

With slapstick comedy, violence galore, top notch digital effects, and a massive budget, the makers of The Lone Ranger were hoping for another franchise to rival Pirates of the Caribbean. In fact, the brothel scene seemed like it was taken directly from POTC. But because this movie tried to be all things to all people, it will probably end up being nothing to most movie viewers. I will be very surprised if it becomes a franchise.",1373155200,10,5661,4.608134920634921
5825121,2,B00DJYJWVW,"I knew going in that The Lone Ranger would have the heavy hands of director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer all over it, the same duo responsible for the everything-but-subtle Pirates of the Caribbean series. Given that, if TLR is to be compared to those movies, it most closely resembles the third one, because that's the one that was all over the map and relied more on explosions and CGI tricks to keep the audience in a slack-jawed endorphin rush in lieu of anything resembling a consistent feel or intelligence.

Johnny Depp continues his string of overboard performances, harkening back to Jack Sparrow and going up through Barnabas Collins, playing the heretofore taciturn Tonto as the quirky jokester to Armie Hammer's dry and lifeless straight man take as The Lone Ranger. I really like Depp's work, but I fear he is becoming (has already become?) a Jack Nicholson-esque caricature of himself. I'd love to see Depp in a role that doesn't rely on accents or fey, droll, oddball behaviors, but it clearly won't be in TLR. William Fichtner plays Butch Cavendish with as much sneering malevolence as he can render, even adding in some Hannibal Lecter for extra creep factor, but he relies a bit too much on scars and bad teeth.  Poor Tom Wilkinson is simply not up to the kind of excess required of the cartoonish bad guy, and is never really scary or threatening as a run-of-the-mill greedy railroad capitalist. Helena Bonham Carter picks up a paycheck as a brothel madam with a surprise up her skirt and little else to contribute. Her inexplicably unnecessary role begs the question of whether or not Tim Burton was at the helm. Rounding out the cast are Ruth Wilson as the drab love interest to The Vanilla Ranger and Barry Pepper as a Custer-like cavalry officer who goes from a conscience-wrestling soldier to a barbaric killer for no apparent reason other than he didn't want to get left out of the ham-fest.

To be fair, this is not a character-driven movie despite the star power, but rather an excessive action romp that tries to do too much, has too much filler, and never really seemed like anything more than yet another lowest common denominator offer from Hollywood. As I said, a good 30-45 minutes could have been eliminated without destroying any of the threadbare plot; thus helping to tighten up the parts of the movie that dragged. Additionally, the movie heaves a dose or two of liberal sensibility upon the audience that was not only out of place in this lightweight popcorn flick, but seemed as if it was done for no other reason beyond superficial finger waving.

The majority will eat this up with a spoon and Walt Disney Inc. is counting on that, but for those who hoped for a bit more, something with a little more cleverness and respect for the audience, you'll be disappointed. Just turn off your brain, eat your popcorn, wash it down with your gallon of soft drink, and stare in wide-eyed amazement at the explosions on the screen. Mmmmm....entertainment....gaaaaa...",1373155200,8,3015,4.814671814671815
5825122,3,B00DJYJWVW,"I think there are four basic problems with this movie and why it's failing in the box office:

- Too many movies competing for dollars at the same time (MU, DM2, WWZ, MoS)

- Too long; should've been editing down at least 15 minutes. For example, if they just did the story minus the narration gimmick where an old Tonto retells the story to a kid at a fair in 1933. I kinda liked bit, but without it the movie is shorter. Maybe they could have found other ways to trim it- also, or instead?? In any case, too long.

- Here's the key weakness with the movie: The Lone Ranger. Tonto is fine; I liked Johnny Depp in this role. Armie Hammer does what he can with the Lone Ranger role. The problem is that he's supposed to be a hero yet you won't find a single person who leaves the movie saying ""cool dude... I wish I could be like him..."". This is because he's an idiot. They wrote the script with the hero being a complete fool who makes stupid decisions throughout. I get the idea of the ""wrong brother"", etc, but come on! He's an idiot. As a result you don't want to be him, or care about him, you just end up plain frustrated.

- Lastly, although I love westerns, I'm not sure the average person today does. This is a minor point... given a terrific fun adventure it doesn't matter if it happens in late-1800s wild west or not.

In any case, I basically liked the movie. It's close to getting a 4-star rating from me, but I just can't get past the frustration of the stupid ""hero"". Tonto saves this movie from pretty much being a disaster; a good Lone Ranger would've been sweet, too.",1373155200,9,1586,4.23841059602649
5825123,5,B00DJYJWVW,"""The Lone Ranger"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: Native American warrior Tonto recounts the untold tales that transformed John Reid, a man of the law, into a legend of justice--taking the audience on a runaway train of epic surprises and humorous friction as the two unlikely heroes must learn to work together and fight against greed and corruption.

The cast led by Johnny Depp (also executive produced) (as Tonto) & Armie Hammer (as John Reid / The Lone Ranger) is pretty good. The directing by Gore Verbinski (also produced) is pretty good. The screen story & screenplay by Justin Haythe, Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio (Elliott & Rossio also executive produced) is pretty good.

The music by Hans Zimmer is pretty good. The cinematography by Bojan Bazelli is pretty good. The film editing by Craig Wood & James Haygood is pretty good. The casting by Denise Chamian is pretty good. The production design by Jess Gonchor & Mark 'Crash' McCreery is pretty good. The art direction by Jon Billington, Naaman Marshall, Iain McFadyen, Brad Ricker & Domenic Silvestri is pretty good. The set decoration by Cheryl Carasik, set dressings by Christopher Casey, Lance Cheatham, Sage Emmett Connell, James Sapienz, Michael Thurman, Erik Torrez & Kevan Weber, set designs by Marisa Frantz, Ricardo Guillermo, Scott Herbertson, Jim Hewitt, Greg Papalia & Siobhan Roome is pretty good. The costume design by Penny Rose is pretty good. The special effects supervised by John Frazier is pretty good. The visual effects supervised by Tim Alexander, Gary Brozenich, Ryan Tudhope & Edson Williams, coordinated by Christopher Blasko, Blair Brownlee, Chrysta Marie Burton, Rachel Galbraith, Jack George, James Greig, James Grummitt, Clayton Lyons, Ale Melendez, Sara Moore, Meghan O'Brien, Allison Paul, Holly Price, Rebecca Scott, DeAndra Stone, Mark Van Ee & Michael Zavala is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Thomas Robinson Harper is pretty good.

This is a pretty good and entertainingly, sometimes, funny film that is pretty good and well-done and also well-made, as well. This is another pretty good teaming of Johnny Depp & Gore Verbinski, as well as, another teaming of Depp, Verbinski & their ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" producer, Jerry Bruckheimer.

5825124,4,B00DJYJWVW,"The Lone Ranger is a thrilling Western, full of amazing stunts and incredible action sequences.  Some of the stunts on the locomotive and the wreck were totally sick.  I watched the movie a second time just to see some of those scenes again.  Awesome!  Those who grew up hero-worshipping the Lone Ranger may be disappointed initially, however, because the story is told from the viewpoint of Tonto, a quirky outcast Comanche brave on a spiritual quest for redemption, played admirably by Johnny Depp.  Tonto is the reluctant hero who rescues and then gives birth to the Lone Ranger, who is actually a dork throughout most of the movie(albeit a brave one).  The two do not begin as friends, but end up as partners as fate and a common goal bring them together again and again.
The humor is delightful: sometimes twisted, sometimes silly but always clever and often unexpected. I laughed when Tonto dragged the Ranger through a pile of fresh horse dung, and again when Mrs. Reid ended up riding backwards on a horse,then grabbed its tail to try and steer it!  Hilarious! It definitely reminded me of the Pirates of the Caribbean.  As an added bonus, the scenery in the movie is unforgettable, full of stunning panoramic shots of colorful bluffs, unusual stone formations and wild desert canyons. The movie also has depth, and a subtle message about history.
I highly recommend this movie.  The Lone Ranger is a solid Western and a truly marvelous action flick, with all the quirky delights and humor of the Pirates of the Caribbean. It is an adult version of the Saturday matinee classic in many ways, but the tremendous climax will still return viewers to the thrilling days of yesteryear.  I will definitely watch it again.",1373068800,5,1723,4.810169491525424
5825125,5,B00DJYJWVW,"While the Lone Ranger succeeds in maintaining a great sense of humor throughout, and never takes it's self too seriously, this film is still able to convey some incredibly powerful messages that need to resonate with more people.

This brilliant story makes it clear as crystal: the Crimes Against Humanity, otherwise known as acts of genocide, committed in the 19th century in the name of ""Progress"" and ""Greed and/or Capitalism"" continues to benefit all non-American Indians to this very day! It was a shocking revelation! I never thought of this legacy of undeserved benefit at the cost of countless innocent lives had anything to do with me!

Our ancestors were a nation of thieves! Hello! Most Americans are descended From European cultures that practically worship property rights and most of us still do! Yet our ancestors would kill entire villages of native people without a second thought in order to steal their land and/or their natural resources! All because they knew they could get away with their crimes without ever being held the least bit accountable by anyone!

There's several episodes of intense violence in the Lone Ranger that made me feel like bolting out the theater door! I have extensive knowledge of American history and the historically accurate violence shown in this film caught me totally off-guard! (See: ""North American Indian Timeline, 1492-1999,"" from thelatinlibraryorg)

What makes matters even more painful is that in various parts of the world the killing of native peoples in order to steal their land and/or natural resources is still going on today! Yes! Today! (See: Survival International, headquartered in London, England with a chapter in San Fransisco; and Cultural Survival located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.)

This story is really about Tonto and his people the Comanche, not the Lone Ranger! Without Tonto, the Lone Ranger would have remained an easily deceived, bumbling fool!

Great cinematography, great music, a nice twist on the myth (which I rushed home from school daily to hear on the radio over 70 years ago), enough humor to poke a bit of fun at being a myth, serious enough to make your heart pound.  Ignore the critics and do not miss this film.  I cheered loudly at its conclusion in rural Texas where you don't make noise in movie theaters.  I joyfully expressed appreciation for those too shy to do so.
 Eighty years ago the Lone Ranger myth was created: a man committed to justice under the law discovers that those in control of the law are using it for their personal gain and therefore decides to become an ""outlaw.""  Perhaps my preference for this myth over that of other action heroes/heroines has to do with my age and having been reared on a farm and riding horses in the Texas Panhandle.  But I think there is a decided gift in the down-to-earth quality of this particular myth.  I also like that it features a couple, not a single person, and that the partner is a native of the land, one grounded in earth tradition and representing those severely oppressed by encroaching forces who are not grounded in the earth.  So check out the Lone Ranger creed.  Here's the core of it:
*  That all men are created equal and that everyone has within himself the power to make this a better world
*  That 'this government of the people, by the people, and for the people' shall live always.
*  That men should live by the rule of what is best for the greatest number.
 It needs to be edited for exclusive language, and of course it would be good to have a female ranger, but otherwise it holds up pretty well.  Put on your mask.",1373068800,9,1702,4.358730158730158

5825129,5,B00DJYJWVW,"Johnny Depp is fantastic as Tonto, really funny with his amusingly odd behaviors. Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger is the more serious guy in the comedy dynamic. The movie has its share of drama too and the villains are very well cast. As a Western, the film incorporates the various factions with competing ideals that existed in this era of America's expansion and there is truth behind the drama. Then, comedy returns. The action is terrific with wild train rides and a stunningly beautiful horse who comes to the rescue more than once. Also, I want to acknowledge the young lad who talks to Tonto. His expressions were believable and he did an outstanding job.",1373068800,12,663,4.724137931034483

5825132,1,B00DJYJWVW,Nothing worked about this. It sooooooooooo boring . Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer are big dopes in this film. Looking back at the big action scene. It wasn't fun .

5825133,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Allegory for our sad times.

Depp was cute-funny frequently in a subtle way and the wonderful scenery and western atmosphere carried the film for me for perhaps the first half. But I found it hard to stomach the future Lone Ranger who was so fixated on a faith in the justice of the system when faced with so much evil and corruption. Just pull the darned trigger I kept thinking. In this sense it dragged and maybe some editing could have helped. Thus minus one star.

For me it picked up after he finally figured out that the whole system was corrupt from the railroad barons to the military, and the Indians never had a chance. Isn't that where a lot of young people around the world are today in fact? They are shedding any idealism that they once had and are ready for some game change.

When the Lone Ranger finally claims ""his manhood"" and begins to fight seriously and to realize why he needs to wear a mask, then the film picked up for me and the ending scenes were spectacular. Quite impressed.

Need I say this was not the Lone Ranger of my childhood!!! This is a post-modern Lone Ranger.

It was too late for the Indians, however, as was also true historically. The ending after the ending is touching where the titles run as Depp as a feeble old Indian rambles and fades off into the wilderness leaving no trace.

The historical context for the film pretty well follows reality. The Indians were tricked and cheated by people who wanted their land and the riches of the west, and the army helped in this effort, perhaps not always aware of how they were being manipulated along with not only the Indians but the settlers and the justice system and the US flag.",1372982400,4,1673,4.450980392156863
5825134,4,B00DJYJWVW,"Unfairly savaged by the critics, Johnny Depp's ""The Lone Ranger"" is a fast, funny western shot on location in Monument Valley by director Gore Verbinski. Depp and Verbinski were the magical team on ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", and magic they have made again. ""The Lone Ranger"" is the story of strait-laced lawyer, John Reid(Armie Hammer), who becomes a symbol of justice, thanks to Native American Tonto...and a white horse. In 1933, a young boy in cowboy clothes enters a wild-west museum, and strikes up a chat with an ancient Indian mummy...who talks. Old Tonto tells him about his experience as a child, when his tribe was wiped-out by two evil white men looking for treasure. The experience disturbs Tonto for the rest of his life. He walks through the desert wearing a dead-crow hat, which he talks to, and feeds seeds. Tonto and John Reid survive a train ambush, and meet Butch Cavendish and his gang, who killed Reid's brother. Along the way, their adventures include phony Camanches, a white spirit horse, and crashing locomotives. Well-timed humor, Monument Valley in Utah, and a reverence for old Westerns is everywhere, along with scenes stolen from ""The Wild Bunch"", ""The Searchers"", and even ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". Meek lawyer John Reid becomes transformed, as he gets hurt, but remains unharmed. As Tonto says: ""You are one who has been to the other side and returned; you cannot be killed. That's why you wear the mask....""",1372982400,3,1443,4.918032786885246
5825135,4,B00DJYJWVW,"""The Lone Ranger"" features a film centered around the characters of John Reid and Tonto (both Johnny Depp and Arnie Hammer gave natural performances in their roles).  Both John Reid and Tonto end up tangling with various other men on both sides of the law.  It is a campy western that sends the message of how people are not always who they seem to appear as on the outside.  Helena Bonham Carter, Ruth Wilson,  and Tom Wilkinson are among the multiple actors/actresses featured in ""The Lone Ranger.""",1372982400,4,500,4.712643678160919
5825136,4,B00DJYJWVW,"The first and last thing that come to mind when I think of Director Gore Verbinski and Producer Jerry Bruckheimer are the train wreck movies that were ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End""; movies that were an incohesive mess. Despite this, the series brought in over a billion dollars for Disney studios and the last two movies actually made more than the far superior original. Knowing Hollywood and knowing this, I assumed that ""The Lone Ranger"" would be the same because they would assume that the incohesive, poorly plotted style actually worked. That couldn't be further from the truth.

At times, ""The Lone Ranger"" changes its tone, switching from action to drama to comedy, but ultimately it always returned to the one thing that brought it all together in the end; the fun. There's a comic book, cartoonish feel to ""The Lone Ranger"" that I found strangely rewarding. Some of the moments in the movie are over-the-top and exactly what you would expect from a summer blockbuster. It's okay though for two reasons:  first of all, it's okay because The Lone Ranger is essentially Dudley-Do-Right in human form and second of all, the movie is actually a story being told by an elderly Tonto and we all know that stories being told about legends, especially old west legends have their share of embellishments.

Johnny Depp's, Tonto is actually really good, even though from time to time his voice is a little too legible, bouncing back and forth between Indian and Depp. Armie Hammer's, John Reid aka The Lone Ranger is equally well done, although Tonto certainly steals the show most of the time. Another thing I was worried about was that I like my westerns to feel western. It did, thanks to William Fichtner's Butch Cavendish and the rest of his evil-doing gang. That may have been the thing I like the most about the movie was that it wasn't at all like the awful ""Wild Wild West"". It was an authentic western with trains, dust, shootouts with accurate guns and damsel in distress. It felt exactly like the 50's Lone Ranger that it was supposed to be portraying; the same Ranger all the kids dreamed of being.

""Ranger"" is a little long in the middle and you can tell when the ending is coming like all the other summer blockbuster special effect heavy movies because you can see where the studio invested their money. All in all though, despite predictability and some unevenness here and there, ""The Lone Ranger"" is a blast of a western to enjoy at the movie theater. It is exactly what you would expect sitting around a porch, a campfire or in this case, a museum listening to an old-codger tell stories about when he was younger and when he was a hero.",1372982400,9,2719,4.69392033542977
5825137,4,B00DJYJWVW,"This movie has been getting really bad reviews.  My son wanted to see it so I went in with really low expectations.  It should have been a complete disaster and a waste of 2 1/2 hours based on the reviews I read.  It's not!  I'm not even certain some of the critics had even seen the movie based on what I read.  I'm not sure what the original story of the Lone Ranger was, but this movie creates a very good back story.  Despite it's length, it moves a long quickly and has a lot of humor.  Even though Johnny Depp gets top billing, this IS about the Lone Ranger.  Yes, Tonto is more important than he was in the old TV series, but how could he not be?  The story is told as Tonto tells it to a young boy.  He may or may not be the most reliable story teller, but that's part of what makes it fun.",1372982400,276,798,3.93125
5825138,5,B00DJYJWVW,"The Lone Ranger is one of my childhood memories, even though I'm young, I used to watch reruns with my grandfather and the story is close to my heart. So I raced to the cinema July 3, and after a slow first act (30 mins.) I loved the film. The comedy was brilliant, the action sequences were top-notch, the acting was great and the horse was the icing on the cake. I found so much enjoyment with this film and will impatiently wait for the second one which, hopefully, improves upon the first one.",1372982400,9,497,4.297872340425532
5825139,3,B00DJYJWVW,"The Lone Ranger tries. It's a weird film, which is refreshing, but the poor pacing almost kills it. The story follows greenhorn John Reid as he stumbles through adventures with Tonto, a crazy Native American on a decades-long mission to hunt down a deranged, cannibalistic criminal.

It deconstructs the original story with the aim of getting in as much cynicism as possible: John believes in preserving all lives, even the villians', not because he's risen above those who don't, but because he's too inexperienced to know better.  The idea of making Tonto crazy works well for Tonto's personality, in my opinion, since it neatly avoids the stereotype of a mystic, halting-English-speaking Native American, while still providing with one. But the mask, the silver bullet, and the phrase `kimosabi' are all bestowed on Reid by Tonto due to the character's slightly crazy nature and the fact that the two don't get along well at first. The source material is spoofed, essentially. The cynicism is a little strong, particularly at the end. Instead of a rousing call for the Lone Ranger's way, Tonto yells as Rein for trying to use the phrase ""Hi-ho, Silver, away!"" Even Pirates of the Caribbean ended with Jack singing his pirate song, followed by awesome theme music.

The poor pacing is the film's major problem, though. I could easily forgive cynicism if it were accompanied by a driving plot. Instead, the film meanders through its two and a half hour runtime, setting up an intricate plot that connects Tonto's back story with both the evil criminal and a railroad magnate. This would be a great plot if it were fun to watch all the time, but too much of it is slow, boring, and attempts to be serious. There's no point to plenty of it, and it seems like a bunch of set pieces -- a brothel, a barn, an indian camp -- without enough reason to justify their existence. It's like all the Pirates sequels, which makes sense, considering it boasts the same writers.

The two big action scenes, both involving trains, were very well-done. Tonto's antics were the best part of the film to watch, but they were sadly few and far between. Armie Hammer did a great job acting as Reid, too. If only the inevitable sequel(s) were to be written by someone with an eye for a fast-paced, relevant plot and more appreciation for the decency of the heroes, we could have a great film. Buuut that's never going to happen.

I would have given this 4 stars, since it's pretty entertaining, but after thinking it over, I realized that I would be letting it off too easy. It can be fun, sure, but movies are supposed to hold together as a whole more than they have been over the last few years.",1372982400,8,2675,4.682978723404255
5825140,4,B00DJYJWVW,"This is precisely why movies were made, escapist fanfare with a flair, and like any other artistic medium, it's up to the the artist and viewer to connect. Like any other artist rendering there are no rules. What would art be with strict rules, that's the whole point of art, to break the rules. Therefore expectations for the Lone Ranger are invalid if it must follow strict rules of formula. What it does is present a new formula with a new flair, and that is what I like about it.
It goes out on a limb, pretty much unlike any LR you've ever seen before, & does so thoroughly with a well rounded cast of villains, good guys, do gooders, sly dogs, and very funny animals. The humor was not too far offshore even though many scenes were highly unbelievable in just plain logic, but that's the beauty of cinema after all.
The location shots and western sets are stunning and immaculate. The main score is the legendary lone ranger theme itself used to the fullest during a train scene that reminds me of How The West Won, & even Back To The Future III. Speaking of BTTF, that's exactly this strain of humor. Whatever the case, and no matter how you look at it, the audience could not stop laughing, yell in appraisal, and clap at many scenes including the rousing action packed finale.
