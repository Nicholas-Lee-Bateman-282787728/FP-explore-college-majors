7953012,5,B00005RYPJ,"I Looooove Dragon Tales! And out of the 3 videos of the series relea  sed, I chose this one! I am 26 years old, but I love this! There is an Ord story and 2 Cassie stories. First, Cassie is upset when she doesn't get picked for the Book Float, Then Ord is upset when he thinks Everyone forgot his Birthday, then Cassie Has to deal with a new dragon named Spike, and thinks He's Mean. But in the end these 3  stories Teach us to ""Look On The Bright Side"" because things work out well for Cassie and Ord in the end.",1010620800,5,513,3.970873786407767
