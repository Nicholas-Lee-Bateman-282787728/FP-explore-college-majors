8550471,4,B00AEG0B8G,"Beautiful footage. I have always held a deep love for the Sawtooth Pack and actually saw Jim's second film 'Wolves at a door' and Living with wolves' before this one. They are much more informative on the pack itself and Jim and Jamie's life amongst them. You begin to perceive each wolves personality and it's impossible not to grow fond of them. Wolf: Return of a legend was created in the early years Jim began forming the pack and though they leave quite a bit out on the individual wolves themselves, it's extremely informative. I had always known that many viewed wolves as ruthless killers and a threat to livestock but to see some clips and footage of the audacious acts to exterminate them was heartbreaking yet eye opening. Wolves are far more similar to us than most would even imagine. Their passion, concern and love for one another is reflected the same as we love and cherish our own. I would recommend this film to anyone and ask that you also watch 'Wolves at our door' and ' Living with wolves' for they are also phenomenal films.",1365638400,4,1048,4.579787234042553
