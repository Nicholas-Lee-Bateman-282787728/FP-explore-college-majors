2344750,1,B000A0GOUU,"I am not going to say George Lpez is not funny.  He just needs to find new material.

If you own the CD ""Right Now, Right Now"" , this is all you need because this DVD is just a rehash of the second album which was a rehash of the first album.

If you have a copy of ""Right Now Right Now"", listen to this CD again and save your money and invest in something more meaningful.",1127692800,11,373,3.8181818181818183
