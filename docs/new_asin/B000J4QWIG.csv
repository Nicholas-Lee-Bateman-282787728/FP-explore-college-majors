2666958,5,B000J4QWIG,"I have to say that from watching many trailers and music video's I couldn't wait to see this film in full. I wasn't disappointed. Although the relationship between teacher and student covers normally dodgy territory, the viewer couldn't help but fall in love with this pairing. The sexual tension that slowly simmers between Annabelle and Simone is captivating. Every glance and touch, so palpable. I loved how Simone kept fighting Annabelle's advances but you just knew when they did get together it was going to be sooooooo worth it. It really was. My only complaint was that they seemed to get 'discovered' too quickly. We could only just see our heroines locked in a passionate embrace before being prised apart. Kudos to Diane and Erin for playing such convincing parts and having such a wonderful chemistry.

Katherine Brooks is a very talented film-maker, no denying that. The movie is very glossy and beautifully shot. There's some beautiful imagery thtoughout the film which reflects in my opinion, the love that grows between the pair.

My only upset was watching the actor and director commentary with Katherine and Erin. This revealed too much of how the film was made under such tight time constraints that so many scenes were cut or there was too much background noise, so certain sounds were dubbed over by other actresses. Whereas I'm not criticising the production of the movie, I just found that this spoiled the magic for me somehow. Considering how small the budget for this movie was, KB has done a fantastic job. This is definitely one of the best,if not the best lesbian film I've seen. Although it would have been unrealistic, I'd have love to see Annabelle get together with Simone a year down the line. I can't help being a romantic! :o)",1166745600,9,1763,4.853820598006645
2666959,5,B000J4QWIG,"I started watching this movie thinking ""please, don't finish!"". It was so good, I had to buy it ASAP. Annabelle is beautiful and Ms. Bradley too. I totally enjoyed every second, every seduction, every look, oh god! so cute! believe me, if you are a lesbian, you have to have it! know what makes it even better? they are both hot, one is a student and the other one is her teacher, so you know is wrong. On top of that they're both women in a catholic all girl school! Imagine!",1166745600,2,476,4.241758241758242
2666960,5,B000J4QWIG,"Though the movie deals w/ a forbidden love, I liked it a lot.  I've watched it numerous times since purchasing it only like a month ago.  I suck at doing these sort of things.  So, I'll just agree w/ all the other positive reviews.  THe only thing I didn't like was the ending.  But, the ending did seem appropriate.",1166659200,5,316,4.288135593220339
2666961,5,B000J4QWIG,"The moment you start watching the movie, you're already intrigued by the movies story-line and exhilarating imagery in every scene. Katherine Brooks has transformed a romantic and compelling story into a journey. Each segment brings new and touching words with every line. The use of poetic imagery lightens the audience to consider that even this love can be fulfilling, no matter what the circumstances are. You are breath taken by the brilliant acting and entirely captured by the story, wanting more and more every minute. I recommend anyone to watch this movie who is looking for something genuinely touching and not just about sex. I was speechless and completely moved by the film. I assure that you'll be watching this more than once... because you just can't get enough of it.",1166400000,3,785,5.0
2666962,4,B000J4QWIG,"I was very impressed with the direction, cinematography, and acting in the movie, especially knowing the budget restraints. It was well done as compared to many GLT movies, which usually have really poor acting. Considering the budget restraints, one can forgive the minor plot fragmenting. I really liked the movie. I wish Katherine Brooks would have had the budget she deserved.",1166054400,3,380,5.245901639344262
2666963,4,B000J4QWIG,"As some of you may or may not know this film was based off the 1931 German film, ""Mdchen in Uniform."" Which in it of itself is a lesbian classic. And Loving Annabelle, is destined to be another. If you are one of those people who listen to the commentary, as I am, you'd realize the amazing time constraints that Katherine Brooks was under to get this film shot and the tremendous talent by the actors to do their scenes under that sort of pressure. That only make me appricate this film more.

As far as the film itself, it follows some of the classic ""cat and mouse"" seductions that many lesbian films have, and like many of those, the climax of the film is the moment when Simone (Diane Gaidry) finally gives into Annabelle's (Erin Kelly) relentless, yet tender advances. However, unlike those films, the controversal under currant of the under-age student/teacher affair and Simone's struggle to curb her fellings make the climax all that more intense.

 The storyline is well laid out, although like most films shot under tight time contraints (be it shooting or running time), there are one or two sub-plots that I would have liked to be better explained or explored. The ending is ambiguous, but it leaves you with a feeling of hope. And if you watch the alternate ending (which should have been the true ending in my book)you'll definately walk away with a good feeling as well as closure.

 For those of you who appriciate cinematography, this film is beautifully shot. This may be me over-reaching for symbolism, but I think the fact that Simone is photographer-at-heart is reflected in the artistic shots that are thrown in here and there.

 As for my overall review, this is one of the best lesbian films to be made this decade and definately makes my top ten. It's well acted, well shot and as I said leaves you with a feeling of hope, as well a wonderful quote at the end from Rilke, who is quoted several times through out the film. I definately give it an A.",1165968000,11,1974,4.575070821529745
2666964,5,B000J4QWIG,"I wanna see this movie soo bad, could someone please tell me if its good?  Could someone please write a review abt what they liked and didn't like about it? Cant wait to see it.",1165881600,,177,4.057142857142857
2666965,5,B000J4QWIG,"Great movie!  One of the things I could NOT find on this page was the following info on the DVD release, THE EXTRA'S.  :Behind the scenes featurette (with outtakes & interviews) , AN ALTERNATE ENDING, Commentary with Katherine Brooks & Erin Kelly, AND Deleted Scenes",1164931200,39,266,4.888888888888889
2666966,5,B000J4QWIG,"This movie is fantastic. You don't really realize how great it is until after its over though. It is a great story. A Catholic Boarding School teacher falls in love with her female student. That's right, it is about lesbians and homosexuality. However, if you are just looking for ""lesbian action"" don't waste your time with this, its not a sex movie. If on the other hand, you are mature enough to handle such a plot, you'll love it. So after an hour of the student pursuing the teacher and the teacher being wary and afraid to be with her.....well I can't tell you how it ends. What I will say, though, is why it is so great. It does not openly debate, discuss, or point out anything about homosexuality being right, wrong, good, or evil. What it instead does is tell a wonderful tale of romantic, yet forbidden pursuit, and no matter what your stance is on homosexuality in general, you cannot help but hope for a happy ending, and get wrapped up in this love drama. After the movie is over, you think of how bittersweet the story is and poor this and at least that and then it hits you - You have been focusing on love, passion, heartache, and beauty....but NOT about Straight or Gay relationships. That's the beauty of this film. It captures you into a world of pure love drama and you forget that it is about a controversial subject at all. Regardless of your stance in this controversy, all you can focus on while watching is a love story between two human beings. Watch it, you'll love it.",1160611200,241,1497,4.447272727272727

It is illegal for any adult to have sex with anyone under 18.

There are certainly enough straight movies with romances between straight teenagers.

2667076,5,B000J4QWIG,"This endearing lesbian drama revolves around the story of Annabelle - who has been expelled from numerous schools due to her rebellious nature, and who finds herself being enrolled in a missionary school where she finds herself being attracted to her female teacher,  Simone, and, consequentially, finds herself making suggestive comments during class to attract the attention of her teacher, for whom she has a crush, only to discover that another one of her classmates has had a similar crush on the teacher some time ago, and during a truth or dare among the students, the one who had a crush on the teacher discovers that Annabelle had had fallen in love with and had intercourse with another girl, whose beads she wears around her neck and refuses to remove despite being threatened by the Mother Superior, thus, leading to confrontations between Simone and Annabelle - where Simone attempts to convince her to remove the beads, to no avail, resultant of which, Mother Superior compels Annabelle to wear a cross around her neck as penance, which she refuses - which leads to another confrontation between Simone and Annabelle, during which time, Annabelle puts to question whether the teacher would remove her cross if Mother Superior had told her to do so, and witnessing Annabelle gradually making overtures to Simone, whose relationship with her boyfriend is less than satisfactory, and who finds herself reminiscing about her first love with another woman and, consequentially, finds herself fantasizing about Annabelle, all the while fighting her temptation towards a lesbian relationship with Annabelle until Anabelle convinces her to take a trip to the beach - where Annabelle finally manages to extract a confession from Simone that she had fallen in love with another woman at some time in the past, whose cross she wears around her neck and refuses to remove much in the same manner as Annabelle with her beads, and, having thus coerced a confession from Simone, manages to seduce her and engage in tender loving intercourse with her teacher, who fights her attraction to Annabelle and refuses to acknowledge her uncontrollable feelings for Annabelle but finds herself asking her boyfriend for more time before committing herself to him in marriage, but, nevertheless, finds herself going to the high school prom with him and dancing cheek to cheek with him, inciting jealousy in Annabelle, who decides to take to her musical roots and serenades Simone before a live audience, making eye contact and subtle overtures to her in song, leading to Simone seeking her out and Annabelle seducing Simone a second time - leading to another bout of tender loving intercourse in Simone's room, inciting the jealousy of the girl who had a crush on Simone who had made overtures to Annabelle only to be rejected - given the fact that Annabelle, is in love with Simone, spurring the culprit to squeak on Simone's relationship with Annabelle to Mother Superior, who, then, discovers the two in a state of semi-undress in Simone's room, leading to Simone's removal from the missionary school and imprisonment in a poignant movie that will move you to tears witnessing the forbidden love between two women who not only find themselves irresistibly attracted to one another but falling in love, with commendable performances by Erin Kelly (who takes on the role of lead actress and plays Annabelle, whose looks are to die for) and Diane Gaidry (playing the role of the supporting actress as Simone), great incorporation of musical theme and songs, a great screenplay and excellent direction by writer/director Katherine Brooks, incorporating a theme questioning the wisdom of Christianity and its prohibition of homosexuality much in the manner that James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man questions the wisdom of the Christian repression of natural libidinal drives and its natural expression in the form of sexual intercourse.

Now, what helps is that Annabelle is incredibly mature for her age (in appearance and personality), because you forget that she is probably 18 (at least I hope). If you remember that detail, it can be a little icky, but the way they develop the film and the love story is beautiful. The love scene is OUTSTANDING!!! One of the best I have seen.

2667096,3,B000J4QWIG,"I didn't read the reviews before renting it so I could get my own perspective, and yeah, I can see why a lot of people don't like it.

They could have made some really simple changes that would have made this so much better.  Why not have Annabelle be a college freshman rather than a HS senior?  It would have made much more sense - but then there wouldn't have been the forced closeness I guess.  Although it seems that still could have been achieved if she lived on campus.

They shared some nice scenes together building the relationship but Annabelle often came off as lusty rather than in love.  I thought Erin's acting was good through most of it but she doesn't look a day under 24.  And Simone often looks old enough to be her mother although I really like the actress - would have loved to have seen this very version of Simone in a more mature version of a struggling relationship.

That said, it wasn't the worst movie I've seen, but you're not really missing anything.",1401926400,,981,4.411111111111111

2667101,5,B000J4QWIG,"I came upon this movie quite unexpectedly after trying to learn the song ""All Over You"" on the guitar which is the signature song of the movie toward the end sung by Annabelle to Simone.

Overall, I thought this movie was fantastic. Great story line and acting. It is very difficult to make a love story, much less a lesbian love story, where the characters are so believable and moving in their interactions with one another. Some seem to take issue with the fact that these two women get together and one is a teacher and the other student but this is not a lust driven movie. The two characters fall in love and their relationship matures as the movie goes along.

I really thought Erin Kelly carried this movie in her pursuit of Simone. She is not only beautiful but is a tremendous actress with her eyes and voice. Diane Gaidry was also great as Simone and did a great job of showing the anguish of trying to do the right thing while falling in love with one of her students.

I did not particularly care for the ending but it did not bother me either. There is an alternate ending where both ladies end up together but even that ending was not great. I know Katherine Brooks had a tight budget for this movie and only three days to shoot it so I am sure if she had more money and time she would have been able to end the movie better.

Still a great movie if you like alternative love stories. Great sound track as well.",1401148800,2,1426,4.289962825278811

2667105,3,B000J4QWIG,"*Spoiler alert*

It left me wanting more... and yet not. The plot was so irritating I didn't want to watch it after the spring break scenes but the ending was so abrupt that it left me checking the time bar to see if there was going to be a flash forward to 10 years later when they ended up together at an appropriate time in their lives! The beginning dragged on for 40 minutes with the background and the climax and ending was literally less then 5 minutes of the movie.

So many characters with such complexity and yet the story never reveals much about any of them. It's like a cliffhanger movie-- leaves you wanting more on every story line but not a single one gets finished.

The build up to the climax was artfully written and acted. I believed the 2 main characters roles and I completely empathized with Simone's pain & struggle trying to live a straight life and cope with the loss of a girlfriend that couldn't take living in guilt and shame anymore. I found myself more often than not just annoyed with the oversexed Annabelle. Her character felt like a typical 16 year old that wants to appear to know it all and be grown and completely short sited as is expected for someone in her age group. I felt the ""lust"" I did not see the ""lovingannabelle"" but perhaps that was due to the lack of maturity on Annabelle's part. The story never really digs in to Annabelle as a person other than the superficial bad girl act and the absentee mother issue. There was nothing to fall in love with other than her body-- which isn't exactly ""love"". I'm never okay with the teacher/student boundary crossing no matter the gender or the age of the main pursuer so that made it hard to feel happy about the climax of them finally being together. For such a strong & calculated character to do something so stupid as to have sex with a student ON campus with school in session simply wasn't believable and felt like the writers got lazy and threw a quick fix on the ending.

 I am glad they didn't try to make the teacher have a different fate than that of a man who gets too familiar with his students so I'm not against the fact that she got arrested-- and happy to see a Catholic school actually call the authorities!! But I just thought it was a weak ending in comparison to the start of the movie. It all just seems unfinished.

As a lesbian I'm glad to see movies that feature our stories and that's the only reason I watched this. Nothing about this story is appealing to me. I think there's a better movie plot in this features back story of Simone and Amanda. Give that one a shot!",1398643200,2,2586,4.354771784232365

Since watching Loving Annabelle I have found other movies both ladies have been a part of & so far have watched Diane Gaidry in the Dogwatcher plus several short movies.  I have found a few movies with Erin Kelly but haven't watched them.  I am anxious to receive them.

By the way, I did like the alternative ending in Loving Annabelle.  Of course in real life the first ending would be more believable.

2667133,2,B000J4QWIG,"The only reason this movie gets 2 stars from me is because the acting is good.  The story line and the writing were a complete disappointment.  The main character, a female high school student, is the best developed character.  She is a wealthy rebel who has been kicked out of a few schools.  However, refreshingly, it is not a pigeon-hole character.  She stands up for her beliefs, sympathizes with other characters, and is tough while being loving.
Ok, I get it, she falls in love with her teacher.  The teacher, who is engaged to a man but has previously had a lesbian relationship, discourages her crush at first.  Eventually, the teacher crosses the line and becomes friends with the student and a romantic relationship occurs.  This movie was written with about as much emotion as my last sentence.  Ok, there is some expected turmoil and they help each other heal regular wounds of life (broken hearts), but I just could have cared less about their relationship.  The movie just wasn't written in a way that connected the viewer with the characters.
Perhaps I just didn't like the teacher, who is suppose to be an antagonist.  Her character is intelligent and that is her only redeeming quality.  She is weak.  She works at a job that she doesn't seem to like, she gets bullied by her boss/aunt and doesn't stick up for herself, she allows a teenager to make her feel uncomfortable, she accepts sexual advances from a teen, and for most of the movie, she is in a relationship with a nice man but doesn't want to actually be in the relationship.  Instead of just letting him go, she strings him along.
Am I suppose to feel bad or empathy for this lady at the end of the movie?  Regardless if it is a straight relationship or a lesbian relationship, regardless if the adult made the first advance or if the teen was the aggressor, the teacher/adult allowed an inappropriate relationship to happen.  Any normally functioning adult would have put an end to it from the beginning and would have reported the teen if it persists. Instead, she used the teen as an escape from her ""not so bad"" life that she created and the movie tries to portray that as ""love"".
Not only was I not feeling any empathy, I wasn't feeling happy about the outcome either.  This movie was lacking in so much character development that I was completely impartial to the ending and was just thinking, ""I want those 2 hours of my life back"".",1378944000,,2417,4.609813084112149

2667156,5,B000J4QWIG,"When Annabelle (Erin Kelly) is sent to St. Theresa's all-girl boarding school by her Senator mother, it is her last chance before being packed off to military school. Rebellious teen Annabelle however, is not moved by the situation. She smokes on school property, drinks with her dorm mates and in general breaks the rules.

After Annabelle is introduced to beautiful poetry teacher Simone Bradley (Diane Gaidry), she is instantly smitten.  Initially Simone dismisses her advances, but Annabelle's relentless pursuit leaves her unsettled. Simone has her own problems; a boyfriend she is avoiding commitment with is pressuring her to move in with him. Annabelle has stirred up long suppressed memories of the love Simone and high school sweetheart Amanda shared. Fighting valiantly against her growing attraction to Annabelle, Simone visits the chapel to pray for guidance. The situation comes to a head at a school dance when Annabelle sings a love song to Simone. In sudden dawning of the true depths of her attraction, Simone leaves the dance. When Annabelle follows, she isn't able to contain her emotions any longer and kisses her passionately. Continued in Simone's dorm room, the two women make passionate love to the rumble of the thunderstorm overhead. The next morning however, the women must rush to dress as Mother Immaculata's footsteps echo in the hallway.

Out writer-director, Katherine Brooks presents an intensely romantic love scene as the rain pours down outside, the women's inhibitions are cast off. The female lead performances are incredibly well done, the maturity that Erin Kelly brings to the role of Annabelle, makes the coupling hot and sexy rather than uncomfortable in this controversial subject.

2667157,2,B000J4QWIG,"...but it's still pretty bad. I mean, i am no film aficionado or anything, but i can still pick problems from this movie too easily. It is a lesbian film for the sake of being a lesbian film. The main character is way too mature for her age, she reflects none of the personality that seems to have put her into the school (juvanile, destruction, rebellious), and the romance is a really creepy underage courtship disguised as a lesbian story. There is no actual cohesive sort of story that contains characters with quirks or feeling, minus, very conditionally, the cutter and the girl who is super mean to her. I really don't want to go into spoilers, but at the same time i would feel bad for creating an air of mystery around the movie that piques anyones interest any further, even though there are a ton of positive reviews. Back to the movie, it's a mess of odd romantic scenes and the obvious sort of stereotypical ""oh being gay is weird but also interesting"" dialogue and opinions. I recently watched ""Imagine You and Me"", and while the movie is more of a traditional romantic-comedy, the whole idea of homosexuality actually mixes it up, and isn't the sort of odd centerpiece that exists solely to exist, but works subtly to show that it is no different than heterosexuality. Not to speak of the other too much, but it showcases everything wrong with Loving Annabelle: it has no reason to exist. The people who made it it wanted to make a lesbian movie, not a story involving lesbians. There is a difference, one is coincidental and meaningful (because just like in real life it doesn't change everything), while the other is extremely pretentious, exploitative, and just takes advantage of the market for movies with girls kissing. Sorry for the ramble to anyone who reads, but the base is that this movie is shallow, lacking in emotion or real personalities, and kind of glosses over pedophilia like it's secondary to...well the movie never really conveys that trump-point.

2667170,3,B000J4QWIG,"Loving Annabelle (Katherine Brooks, 2006)

A couple of months before I am writing this review, the readers of website afterellen.com named Loving Annabelle one of the ten best lesbian/bi movies ever made. (It came in at #9.) I can't claim to have seen more than a handful of movies that made the top 50, and I also haven't seen--though not for lack of trying--the movie this is a remake/reboot/reimagining/whatever the kids are calling it these days of, the 1931 German feature Madchen in Uniform. So I'm coming into this about as pristine as I can, and maybe that's not the best position from which to review this; I don't know enough about it, so take that with as much salt as necessary. But with all that said, I'll tell you that aside from some pacing problems (odd in a film that runs just seventy-five minutes), I found this movie quite enjoyable, with solid performances turned in by the principals, a sufficiently nasty pair of antagonists, and well, if I tell you everything I liked about this movie we'd be getting way into spoiler territory, so you'll just have to trust me on this one.

Plot: Annabelle Tillman (Brooks regular Erin Kelly), the daughter of an outspoken American senator, has been transferred to a strict Catholic all-girls' school after being thrown out of her last two schools. She immediately butts heads with the headmaster, Mother Immaculata (Ladybugs' Ilene Graff), and soon finds herself roped into a tempestuous love/hate relationship with dorm neighbor Cat (Gustine Fudickar in her only screen appearance to date). However, she's really interested in her English teacher, the unhappily-married Simone Bradley (The Dogwalker's Diane Gaidry in her final feature appearance as I write this in January 2013), and launches a campaign to woo her. Can such a romance survive the crossing of so many ethical and religious barriers?

Like many of my favorite romance films, Loving Annabelle is less about the hot, sweaty monkey sex than it is about the tension of the waiting, the chase, the slow burn that happens before anyone hops into bed. You can never be quite sure, even as it becomes obvious that Simone is falling for the fetching Annabelle (and come on, who wouldn't?), if these two are ever going to get together; Annabelle, being young and brash, isn't looking at the long-term problems, while Simone is constantly wrestling with them. (""We're not doing anything wrong,"" Annabelle says at one point. In a Catholic school? Oh, if only things were as simple as Annabelle believes them to be.) Brooks, though, isn't quite as good behind a camera as are directors like Nicole Conn (Cynara: Poetry in Motion) and Christopher Ashley (Jeffrey), especially when it comes to the pacing of the thing. As I said, this movie runs just seventy-five minutes, and there are parts in the first half-hour where things drag. I think those bits are supposed to be character-builders, but we don't seem to be gaining any insight; maybe one more rewrite of the script was necessary? That's a minor thing, though; there's a great deal to like about this movie, and I don't want to put anyone off watching it simply because it drags in a few spots. This is a solid little romance with two very likable characters, and it's worth your time as long as the same-sex nature of the romance doesn't squick you out. ***",1360800000,,3329,4.857394366197183

Lesbians are not unintelligent uninformed weak and spineless individuals who fall for children. They are strong, ethical and kind, and go out of their way to protect children.  Did you see the Mother Superior try to hit on Simone?  Wow, and a Catholic high school allowed this to be filmed on their campus. Not cool.

2667181,2,B000J4QWIG,"The ""secret"" to this film's 'success' is essentially by taking three fetishes (catholic school, teacher/student, and lesbian)and rolling them together into a sloppy film. It's guaranteed audience and buzz. I'm not going to say it doesn't live up to any of it - if it's the love scene people want, they don't necessarily cop out. That said, it's pretty obvious this is a first time full length feature directorial debut, because this movie is such a mess. So many characters are underdeveloped or unnecessary, several scenes don't work, and much of it needed to be reshot and reworked. It isn't a long movie as it is, and clearly they took whatever takes they could assemble and tossed them in. The logic is also void in many scenes, such as this ""forbidden"" affair happening in plain sight, like sharing a cigarette on campus or making out in front of the busiest school dance. A script supervisor was desperately in need here as was more consistency and a better script. Diane Gaidry's performance is really what saved this movie from being rated a 1, and that was just a lucky accident. Try watching it more than once and see how quickly it loses its ability to hold up in any credible way.",1355702400,8,1192,4.680952380952381

Usually, when a romance like this happens, in today's world, the people involved take action on their feelings sooner. It seemed to drag out. The teacher was so hesitant that although you can understand her hesitation, the student came on so strong, that it would normally be hard to refuse or overlook her advances.
I did like the gift of instant video rental, so that I could watch it before receiving it. In hindsight, I should have just rented this movie, instead of buying it. I also think this movie was geared to a younger audience than myself.",1351382400,2,785,4.574468085106383

The tale of forbidden love between teachers and students is nothing new but the emotional intensity, the psychological tension with the ebb and flow along with the characters just takes your breath away. You may find yourself reminding yourself to breath as your heart hungers for a respect, a love, a connection as great as that of Annabelle and Simone. I am neither teacher nor student but I could tell you in a heartbeat that in watching this - you'll never have to worry about identify with the main characters. There's nothing gratuitous about this which makes it a great change from typical overloaded lesbian fare that borders on softcore porn more often than not. Take a chance and watch this, if you are not as in love with Annabelle and Simone as I was by the closing frame  .  .  . you can be assured that something is broken inside you.

2667199,5,B000J4QWIG,"this movie changed my outlook on student teacher relations. i remember when this movie came out it was going on alot, teachers being caught fooling around with students.
this is a movie about a girl named annabelle who through her family has grown up fast. shes almost out of highschool and goes to a boarding school.  at the school she meets simone whos girlfriend has died (ok thats a little spoiler but youd find it out soon enough) and is a teacher at her school. simone is quite young herself, though she is an adult, its not like shes some wrinkled up old hag preying on kids.  anyways, annabelle being more mature than her classmates pretty much dismisses them and some affections with her eye set on simone.  they are truly spun on eachother.
nobody is preying on anyone in this.  it just goes to show that theres a reason many states have an age of consent.  this movie remains one of my favorite love stories and you don't have to be gay to appreciate it.  this movie also made me think before pointing my finger when a student teacher controversy shows up in the newspaper if its consentual and the kids almost out of highschool theres probably alot more to it than the parents and faculty think up.",1324598400,6,1210,4.502283105022831

Director Katherine Brooks did an excellent job with the budget that she got, I honestly feel though that some of the deleted scenes and the director's cut should have stayed in the film. Erin Kelly did an AMAZING Job as Annabelle, and Diane Gaidry was equally exceptional. The love scene of course, had most if not all of us, note...rain, makes EVERYTHING perfect :).
This film gets 5 stars not only because of the student teacher taboo, but it definitely ventures off into and shows that side of intimacy, want, and love that evades mot lesbian films.

2667207,5,B000J4QWIG,"I purchased this film about 2 weeks ago, and I have barely gone a day since without watching it at least once. I love it more and more every time! Honestly, a large part of the reason I love it so much is because Erin Kelly (Annabelle) is so gorgeous in this film. But that's not the only reason I loved it. It's a passionate tale of love and longing, which I can very definitlely relate to. The love scene (yes, there is a lesbian love scene) is the most beautiful scene I have ever watched in any movie. You will find yourself drawn into their lives and feel what the characters feel. It's not the standard teacher/student love affair, you really get the sense that these women have a deep connection, and that's what drives the movie. You want their love to be victorious and conquer all the stereotypes. There is such a great buildup of their love, which makes it so much more intense and exciting in the end when they finally express their love for each other. And to top it all off, the music throughout the movie flows perfectly with the storyline and adds to the overall beauty and emotion of the film.

If you're like me, after the film is over, you'll want to start watching it again immediately. Also, all the extras like alternate ending, deleted scenes, and director/actor commentary make me appreciate the film even more.

2667210,4,B000J4QWIG,"The movie is entirely driven by Diane Giadry's(Simone)and Erin Kelly's (Annabelle)outstanding performances. Giadry has an uncanny ability to draw the viewer in with the way she carries herself through out the film. On the outside, her character appears as a confident Catholic school teacher in command of her life.  Then, through her interaction with her student, Annabelle, we find she's conflicted, guarded, and emotionally closed off. As their relationship intensifies, and Annabelle literally and figuratively draws Simone out, it's easy to believe as a viewer you have a secret window into a relationship that is unfolding right before your eyes.

The music is beautiful, the scenery is intoxicating, the subject matter intriguing, and Diane Giadry is so talented; her body language and eyes are magnetic, but the film does have its flaws. The writing and continuity is sometimes choppy and weak. I'm not sure if the movie intended,(the extras allude to it)but I found myself questioning Annabelle's motivation: initially I felt she was driven solely by sexual desire; it wasn't until well into the film that I believe Annabelle loves Simone. This was distracting for me. The open ended ending would have sat better with me if it leaned just a bit more toward the hopeful rather than the doomed. However, this is my favorite lesbian film, and the best that I have ever seen. It stands head and shoulders above the rest; I wish it were longer!

Unfortunately, a part of me feels like I enjoyed the film more before watching the Special Features included on the DVD, and this is usually my favorite part of any DVD. While I love bloopers and deleted scenes, I was disappointed to learn there are even more deleted scenes and promo stills floating around the Net that do not appear on the video. They are poignant scenes that really should have been included. The interviews are abridged; they also appear in their entirety on the Net which is disappointing too. What I truly disliked about the extras was director, Katherine Brooks, stating that she hated just about every scene and that there were some amazing, touching performances by Giadry and Kelly that ended up on the cutting room floor, and again were not included on the DVD. Also, it's irritating to see that Brooks cut so much of the film based on what she wanted to see with little consideration for her audience. Lastly, I was not offended by the subject matter one bit. I was thrilled to see a film address it, but what I was offended by slightly was Brooks and Kelly's commentary. It was a bit frat boyish, and Brooks confusing words and spelling things incorrectly on her tag cards makes her come off as even more unpolished.",1296864000,4,2696,4.869281045751634

That's important information and should be stamped across the title in big letters to alert those might have thought it's a romantic story, the kind heterosexuals might enjoy.",1294790400,,423,4.578947368421052
2667212,3,B000J4QWIG,"Knowing that Diane had 3 days to prepare for her part and that they did the thing on a song, an independent film, low budget... well, it is okay.  Not bad. There are a couple of disconnects like, why is Simone working on that particular set of old photos in the library?  And Mother Imaculata seemed a bit over the top.  The spring break holiday, again, kinda forced.  The mechanism to get these two together seemed silly.  ALSO, seriously, Annabelle leaves to chase after Simone while the song she is playing still is playing?  They might as well ran into eachothers arms during the dance.  THe other thing...do no doors have a lock?

I know I am supposed to suspend my beliefs here, but there were too many to suspend to not bug me.  It seems like the movie tried to be something between a love story/drama and a psychological drama.  Not quite making the grade on either front.  But... I totally thought Diane Gaidry was wonderful, or at least 85% of the time.  Her mouth and eyes are incredibly expressive.  Her conflict seemed genuine.  WHile I loved the bathtub scenes, there were 3.  One too many.  I also wanted her to be reading or something when Annabelle walks into her rooms.

Words can not even Begin to discribe this love story I thought for years that The Notebook was the best love story I had ever seen I was Dead wrong.  Loving Annabelle was that movie for me this movie helps a lot on how you feel that your not the only one it the world out there that is different or feels the same way you do.

2667214,5,B000J4QWIG,"This film is one of total artistry where nothing has been put into the film without careful thought and compels the viewer to rewatch it many times. The writer / director Katherine Brooks (including the very actors and the rest of the team) have a fine gift for narration- example the opening sequence of Annabelle arriving with her patrents tells everything about the family relationships and it very delicately shifts the poerspective from the school institution (via Simone initially) views Annabelle's rebellious outlook and shifts the point of view around when you see that there is a reason and somehow you see how relations shift between the two central characters. Considering the limited resources given to the film, it is an extraordinary production. The 'official ending' is what can happen while the alternative ending (in reality a brief continuation) is what the viewer feels should happen. The film poses questions about the relationship very delicately.

2667215,2,B000J4QWIG,"I really had a hard time trying to get engulfed into the film. It lacks depth and proper transitioning, it missed some links **WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS**

1: obviously Annabelle and Collins share a connection, however there is not a scene that seems to reinforce that idea other than when Annabelle reveals Collin's scars on her wrists. There is no reinforcing evidence that they are close friends or even kindred spirits.

2: the only teacher is Simone, there is no biology teacher, science teacher, just the poetry teacher. Hm..I guess the only curriculum at the all girls school is just POETRY huh? No math, no geology...

3: the father of the school makes several remarks that are arguable on a religious spectrum, I mean, yes it's good to play devil's advocate, and YES there are several Religious institutions that accept homosexuality, but I don't feel that this film even DESERVES to be as blatant as to contain arguable quotations.

But I can say, the final 20 minutes was worth watching. Watching Simone being whisked away by the authorities seemed pretty real minus Annabelle being at the location, I mean honestly it would've been more realistic if Anabelle had been at another location (library, room, another classroom) and then had found out about it later and made a visit at the prison.

The plot is great, it's got a Maedchen in Uniform feel..however it needed to be worked on so much more.",1274140800,6,1409,4.854166666666667
2667216,4,B000J4QWIG,"This film captures the confusion and fear of a woman-Simone Bradley, played by Diane Gaidry-that on the outside, is ""picture perfect,"" yet on the inside is in an abysmal torment due to her obsession with her former *lover* & who she is sexually. In walks a new student who turns her perfect, barely balanced emotional world completely upside down. The story unfolds as Simone must let go of things in the past & present, which leads to her new love-the student that ""helps"" her through this journey.  Diane Gaidry does a phenomenal & breathtaking job of capturing the intensity of her character; obviously torn. I really enjoyed how the scenes, although a tid bit short, are not overdone.  For being filmed in 3 weeks-it is truly extraordinarily captivating.

What I find lacking in this film:

- Why on earth would the director delete the scene on how they first met??? Their first encounter is when Simone is already in conversation with Annabelle--what director does that???

-The film is very *jumpy* from scene to scene, without much explanation. I had to see the movie 3-4 times before I fully understood what I think was the vision that Katherine Brooks had when she wrote the narrative.

-It takes way too long for them to finally actualize what the film is inevitably leading up to & when the climax of the film finally does come; I find the scene rather short (but the emotion is captured beautifully). Simone should have spent some time basking in the sleeping Annabelle before she looked at the clock, and they should not have been caught so quickly.

-What happens next? The film-just as it abruptly jumps from scene to scene, just ends.  I'd like to know what happens with Simone without having to see the alternate ending.

-Simone is always, always crying: why? It makes her character look not only torn & in pain, but consistently crying makes her seem weak, unable to be such the ""Strong one"" that her previous lover refers to her as (in the note).

-That deleted scene: the one when Simone cries in class should have stayed in the film, while several other Simone crying scenes deleted. This one scene was enough to captivate the emotional upheaval that Simone was going through-and I think Annabelle should have seen her cry.

-That pool scene with Simone and Annabelle should have stayed in the film.",1273708800,6,2321,4.763092269326683

2667220,4,B000J4QWIG,Personally I absolutely loved this movie and I thought it was both romantic and full of angst. Annabelle is a troubled student at a Catholic high school and Simone is her poetry teacher. Annabelle is 17 and Simone appears to be in her thirties. Despite the age difference Annabelle pursues Simone and falls in love with her. This is understandably a subject that will make some people uncomfortable but the movie itself was soft and beautifully told. The progression makes sense and in the end you find yourself wanting them to be together. Very romantic in my opinion and visually appealling.,1269129600,,593,4.881188118811881

Katherine Brooks has handled a controversial subject with lan and sensitive ease. The music of the film captivates the senses. The plot progressively unfolds intricate layers that need to be explored and interpreted in order to appreciate the story fully.

The characters are well sketched - Annabelle is free spirited, defines her own rules and lives on her own terms. Simone is her antithesis. She is restrained and abides by the regulations prescribed by society and religion. She fights a hard battle with herself to resist Annabelle's disarming smile and relentless pursuit nonetheless develops a deep emotional connection with her. Simone's tragic vulnerability and Annabelle's heartfelt pining is noticeable during the annual school dance.

2667226,5,B000J4QWIG,"This is a great film and very addictive. You forget that this is the story of a teacher and a student because the characters seem so real and likeable, and you want them to be together.

The writer does a good job of dealing with the moral dilemma by providing an ending that shows the consequences of their actions, while allowing viewers to 'have their cake too' by providing an alternative ending which sees them (potentially) getting back together.

If the film has any flaws they're that:
(1) it's difficult to see the development of Simone's ""love"" for Annabelle, as opposed to her attraction to her. When Simone says at the end that she loves Annabelle, it's unbelievable and an uncomfortable reminder of the real-life examples of deluded teachers who have slept with their students.
(2) the film seems to end too quickly after Simone and Annabelle are discovered; and
(3) some of the deleted scenes, such as the encounter between Simone and Annabelle at the pool, would have improved the story line.

Finally, I still can't figure out why:
- they didn't just wait to take another trip to Simone's beach house;
- it didn't occur to them to lock the door at any point during the night;
- they didn't hear those noisy footsteps; and
- Annabelle didn't just hide in the closet.",1249084800,3,1281,4.684444444444445

I got about 95% of the way through this movie before I stopped. I realized that I didn't care if the women in the movie lived or died.

The young girl in the movie is supposed to be a ""bad"" girl (conveyed to us by her smoking and her awful orange highlights). The character of the teacher is hardly developed. And while I'm not shallow, I couldn't concentrate on anything she was saying due to the Grand Canyon-like wrinkle between her eyebrows.

2667241,1,B000J4QWIG,"From the beginning of this movie, I just couldn't shake the feeling of how wrong it is - this teacher becoming involved with a student. It's more than the fact that Annabelle is under 18.... Just like parents and clergy, teachers hold a unique place of trust, authority and responsibility. Even though Annabelle was the one who pursued the relationship, that doesn't make it any more okay for Simone to cross the line.

As much as I had hoped that this would be a good movie (based on the overall good reviews), the relationship between these two was just plain inappropriate and it grossed me out! I still shudder when I think of it.

If this movie had been about a mother and her daughter becoming sexually involved, that would have disgusted me. Simone, a clearly much older woman, was Annabelle's teacher and dorm monitor. The relationship between them should have been parental in nature, never sexual.

As for other elements? The acting was not great, but I've seen worse. The filming was average - again, I've seen worse, but I've seen a lot better too. Aside from the BIG issue of a teacher becoming sexually involved with a student, I would rate the film perhaps 2 or 2.5 stars at best. Throw in the teacher-student aspect and my resulting nausea and I can't give this better than 1 star.",1220659200,21,1297,4.630434782608695
2667242,5,B000J4QWIG,I just wached this movie and I couldn't stop waching it. Like ten times in 2 days. I think is a great love story. And the sex scene is pure art.,1219622400,,144,3.6774193548387095
2667243,2,B000J4QWIG,"To paraphrase the director in one of the DVD's special features interviews, the aim of ""Loving Annabelle"" was to tell a story about a teacher/student relationship that didn't automatically condemn every aspect of the relationship as irresponsible and horrible.  You may find that to be a gutsy approach or a reprehensible one (we can talk about my own feelings over a beer if you want), but if you seek out this movie, I'm guessing that you're at least open to the idea of pretending such a relationship isn't all that bad so you can enjoy the sensual adult fare the film offers.

Alas, for those of you in such a category, I'm sad to report that there isn't very much sensual adult fare in ""Loving Annabelle"".  There's only fleeting, rare nudity and fleeting, rare, and (sigh) discreetly-filmed sex.  And that's strange, because one of the director's other motivations for making the movie was (I'm paraphrasing her again) ""...to show some really hot stuff, the kind of stuff that turns me on, the kind of stuff I really like to do and have done to me when I'm in a hot relationship.""  I guess the director really enjoys endless worrying and endless discussions about what's right and wrong about her life.

To be fair, the story is watchable and not entirely uninteresting, just not very shocking and, to get serious for a moment, not very thematically ambitious (see, I'm not just interested in sex).  In other words, typical traditional moralism, that firmly reinforces the social status quo, is very much in place at the end.

So, throughout the film, you don't get much that's all that compelling story-wise, and you don't get much erotically-charged material, either.  And sometimes what erotic content you do get almost seems to be there accidentally.  For example, all the scenes of the girls in their Catholic school uniforms smack of unintentional fetishism instead of an honest attempt to show what such schools are really like.  But I guess viewers have to take what stimulating elements they can get here.

I will say this: we learn from the extra features that the movie was filmed on a shoestring budget and took forever to finish due to money issues; it's to its credit, then, that the movie looks as good as it does.

In the end, ""Loving Annabelle"" is well acted and works fine as a sort of R-rated (and a soft ""R"", at that) ""Lifetime"" movie.  Just don't let the pretty women on the DVD cover and the film's subject matter get your hopes up about getting much beyond a marginal time passer.",1214956800,,2508,4.722477064220183

2667249,3,B000J4QWIG,"Foundation, foundation, foundation. That is what the movie lacks. The movie is not that bad but, it lacks foundation for the characters, for the storyline and even for the back-stories. The director just lays everything out, without tying it to anything, giving it a reason to be or a meaning.

The movie fails at the very beginning because it fails develop and ""explain"" why Annabelle falls for Simone. Honestly, why does she like her so much? There are very few scenes that barely, if at all, present the start and development of the crush.

The movie also fails to explore the relationship between Simone and her aunt, and her ex-girlfriend. Characters do things which seem out a character and without any reason. And the reason for this is that they have no foundation.

There are many wasted scenes, and too many lingering looks that amount to nothing. The time could have been better used developing the story. The movie takes 72 of its 77 minutes getting Annabelle and Simone together and then abruptly ends, in a not so happy ending (but at least a realistic one), without any explanation of what happened later (watch the alternate ending). Basically, this movie is 72 minutes of foreplay with a 1 minute climax that falls flat.

The movie is not that bad, but it was poorly fleshed out. The acting is not the best, it is emotionless at times (especially when it should be VERY emotional), and it is also a bit too restrained. The character of Simone (Gaidry) is boring, inconsequential and uni-dimensional. She could have been better if her story had been given some dimension and background. On the other hand, the character of Annabelle (Kelly) is absolutely mesmerizing. She played the character perfectly. Kelly basically carried the movie. The movie needed better editing and better direction. The cast and crew should have taken more than the 3 weeks it took to shoot and attempted to get better acted scenes.",1207872000,12,1925,4.8419452887537995

2667251,4,B000J4QWIG,"I didn't read the description before I rented this movie. I just went off the title alone. So when Annabelle arrives at boarding school, I was expecting her to hookup with the rebellious Cat.  But then the moment Annabelle gives her poetry teacher a thorough head-to-toe once-over during class, I realized this film was going to take us in a far different direction, and I'm glad for it.  How many times have we been attracted to the wrong person and couldn't help it anyway?  And there's a real struggle there. We watch the teacher's life implode in slow-motion. Everything she'd built up around her begins to crumble and scare her; and the catalyst for that is a student who refuses to compromise herself. Simone and Annabelle are like two sides of the same coin--the older woman more world-weary and shut down, and the younger one more idealistic and open to new possibilities and being true to herself (and encourages Simone to do the same).  I have to say the actress who plays Simone does an extraordinary job, presenting Simone as someone cautious and yet human and open--reluctantly and believably not immune to Annabelle's advances. And Erin Kelly as Annabelle is smouldering.  So much of the communication and chemistry between them develop through glances, and the eyes of these actresses are soul-achingly deep.  I was, in fact, rooting for them for the whole movie, despite the age difference, despite the impropriety and rule-breaking. It is an interestingly sympathetic look at what is often sensationalized in the press, with the older teacher being demonized. In the context of this movie you get two sympathetic leads in a difficult spot.  The movie, while clearly loving these characters, doesn't go easy on them.  This movie was a big surprise--far better than I expected. And, as anothe reviewer said, the sex scene when Simone finally succumbs feels entirely believable and hot.

After panning to the sand and beach, they show the two of them laying together in bed. Annabelle's leg draped over Simone's, her arm holding hers...it was such a sweet, innocent scene.
I really enjoyed the movie. I thought both actresses were gorgeous, I thought the love making scene was extraordinarily real...I only wish Simone brought a little more passion to the scene. When they finally give into each other outside of the dance, my stomach leapt wildly with anticipation.

I'm always looking for a good film with strong lesbian characters -- they are hard to find -- and this movie was no exception.  I'm tired of all of these films veering so far from reality that, as a lesbian, I am embarrassed to have been portrayed in such a way.

Why is it these movies seem to go for shock value?  If we want to be accepted by the mainstream, perhaps we should think about the impact films like this have.  And yes, there are many straight films with questionable plot lines and content -- but there are plenty that don't.  There are so few lesbian movies and fewer still are of any quality or substance.  I'd rather see less skin and better developed plot lines and characters that I want to root for.  If I can't fall in love with the characters and believe how they are feeling...

2667254,1,B000J4QWIG,"Fortunately, this movie is very short.  Unfortunately, it isn't mercifully short.  By now, you can probably tell that neither my wife nor I found much to like about it.  One aspect of the movie that really grated on me is the music; it felt like a funeral dirge.  As usual in progay movies, the Church has to be made out to be the 'bad guy' because it is the strongest force in society for morality.  When one understands the Divine guidance of the Church, it becomes evident that all these progay movies are an attempt to deny the authority and power of the Divine.

The reason I give the movie a D and not an F is that it shows Annabelle as really a social and morality rebel.  If she were in a Moslem school, she probably would have rebelled against the niqab.  In the two previous secular schools she was kicked out of she undoubtedly found other ways to defy the rules.  So, it makes sense that in a Catholic school she would choose one of the Church's most vile sins to throw in the face of the nuns.  There is nothing in the movie that indicates in any way that she had any prenatal or psychological compulsion to homoerotic sex.

As for the teacher, she is a pathetic person.  One can't decided if she needed compassion or deserved revulsion.  How could she be a teacher in a Catholic school and not have any apparent sense of moral conflict in this situation?  Was she raised to be such a weak person?  Or was she unconsciously rebelling against Catholic doctrines?  One thing is certain and that is that she was in severe violation of the proper teacher/student relationship.  For that, she seems to have received what she deserved; an outcome that any male teacher in such a position would certainly have experienced.

2667261,4,B000J4QWIG,"I caught this movie on the Logo Channel so I don't have the dvd but I figured I'd write a review anyway.

It's the story of a rebellious teenage girl who gets put into what is for her a very repressive and frustrating environment.  A Catholic all girls school.  (Then again it could have become a very exciting environment for her !)

Annabelle is more mature than the other girls.  She has already discovered her sexual orientation, drinks, smokes, etc..  So right there she's on a collision course with Mother Immaculata.

She starts to feel a strong attraction to and bond with the poetry teacher who coincidentally has also experienced a separation from her former 'friend'.

There's some religious symbolism in the movie as Mother Immaculata forces Annabelle to wear these gigantic rosary beads around her neck like a ball and chain because she refuses to take off her Buddist prayer beads.  Those rosary beads sort of symbolize the heavy weight that has been placed on her feelings I guess.

But don't worry.  Annabelle is young, strong, beautiful, and relentless in pursuing the object of her affections.

Along the way she rejects the advances of one of the other girls who just wants to 'experiment'.  Rather she longs for the poetry teacher who is more mature and wants the same things.

This is one of those movies where the sexual tension builds against the backdrop of oppression and restrictions.

In a movie like this the teacher's boyfriend, the Church, society, and even the government are all ""the enemy"".  All of those institutions only undermine and frustrate what these individuals really want.

Nowadays I don't know how realistic it would be for something like this to happen.  Rather they would most likely just go away together.

But it could perhaps happen if this forbidden relationship threatens the teacher's job for example.

2667263,5,B000J4QWIG,"This film is by far one of the best I have watched in a long time. The plot is well developed and equistively filmed with poignant music to bring emotion instead of words.
A story of taboos with a student at an all-girls catholic school romantically pursuing a female teacher. ""Bad girl"" Annabelle has a rebellious streak that brings negative attention to her causing the superintendant to ask Simone, the poetry teacher, to keep an eye on her. The dynamic between these two characters is intense, heartwarming, and heartbreaking. What seems like a crush soon blooms into a forbidden affair.
Excellent music throughout the entire film.",1196035200,2,635,5.0

This movie is not just some sappy romance; in fact there are only a couple make out scenes. This is an intelligent romance between two women. The fact that Annabelle is only 17 does not even seem to be a big deal. Simone is 32 and is young herself. The women look very beautiful together, Annabelle with her dark hair and Simone with her blonde hair. I wish that the alternate ending was the real ending. When you watch this movie; go the alternate ending afterwords. I am waiting for a sequel. There are no current lesbian movies that even compete with this!

For the longest time my favorite movie for this ganre has been Debs due to the cutness and the fact there is not much else out there.  However, after watching this movie I now have not only a new favorite movie for this genre but I new favorite for my top five all time list.  What I found in this movie that was so moving was that I continuously forgot about it being about two women but it become a story about two people in love without being able to get togehter.  Anyone, hetero or homo, could watch this movie and feel for it.  It's one of the first times in my life in which I was voting for the teacher/student relationship to survive.  Thank god for alternative ending lol.

The chemistry between the two actresses was outstanding and the writing was just brilliant.  Personally I can not wait to get home from work and go watch it over and over again.  It makes waiting for the rest of season three of south of nowhere much more bareable.

2667270,4,B000J4QWIG,"I rented this movie twice and it was incredibly moving. The characters Simone and Annabelle are the focal points of the whole story. Simone, the teacher, is struggling with her fiancee. She doesn't know what she wants out of the relationship with him. Annabelle is a teenage punk, sort of, with a girl next door persona. My favorite parts are the ""Library Come Out"" scene; where Annabelle talks about her last girlfriend. Then there's the beach house, Annabelle singing ""All Over Me"", and the terrible ending. I couldn't stand that these two people were torn apart. It's that kind of pain that makes me think that love endures without end. It knows no limits from inside or out.

Marisa Tomei, in ""Untamed Heart"", said that you love with your mind and your soul, not actually with your heart. This movie shows love with your mind, your soul, and especially with your heart. Buy it, watch it, remember it. Stay strong and stay proud.",1190160000,3,932,4.717791411042945

The ending leaves much to be desired, though. The 'alternate ending' on the extras really adds onto the actual ending rather than changing it and provides the viewer with the closure needed to move on and not become and emotional wreck over the affair. I'm puzzled as to why it was left off but highly recommend the movie either way.",1188345600,,591,4.5233644859813085
2667273,4,B000J4QWIG,"This film is built on Rilke's poetry. Simone first becomes aware of Annabelle when Annabelle uses Rilke to get inside Simone's head to seduce her--sex and love can be one, especially if the sex is really good sex. . . I was half expecting jabs at the patriarchal symbolism of the Catholic Church; however the ""bad Catholic"" in the film is a controlling woman, not a man. The true patriarch in the film is a priest who has given up control, instead imparting wisdom and compassion when he can. There are several conflicts here, the strongest is conveyed when the head mistress asks Simone hadn't she ever thought what she was doing was wrong, and Simone's reply was yes, she had thought about it at every instant. The most interesting character to me was Cat, aptly named because she pounces on anything, mauling it, without really meaning to--it's just her nature. Annabelle is a skilled seductress but she misjudges the lethality of Cat. Cat is the irritant, the grain of sand that makes pearls, and poetry.",1187136000,2,1008,4.732954545454546

2667275,4,B000J4QWIG,"Loving Ananabelle is well written, well directed, and both stars (Diane Gaidry and Erin Kelly) do excellent work here.

The story does a fine job of showing the venom faced by anyone who chooses to be different from the ""norm"", whatever that is.  Although this movie touches on lesbianism, it is not simply a story about lesbians.  And it is not porn, in my opinion.  It's more a story about love, about prejudice, ostracism, harassment and about the courage and suffering required of those brave enough to openly leave the safety of the herd.

I would have rated this movie a strong five, had it not been for the ending.  The writer/director is certainly a talented artist to have created such a fine and insightful story and to write and direct it so well.  But she certainly could have done better on the ending; it was quite disappointing.  The alternate ending available was better, but it was still less that adequate.

Overall, I recommend the movie, Loving Annabelle.  Be ready for considerable disappointment during the final ten of fifteen minutes, however.",1185062400,9,1067,4.845303867403315

2667289,1,B000J4QWIG,"This movie is not about being Lesbian, although it pretends to be. Does being unprofessional and inappropriate somehow lack import when it happens between two women? While there are so many opportunities for Annabelle's TEACHER to draw an appropriate and professional line around Annabelle's attempts at seduction, she seems to be completely unable to do so. Nor is she able to draw the line with a boyfriend she clearly has no interest in,  even though she sleeps with him anyway. Nor can this teacher seem to be able to stand up to the Aunt who is her supervisor at work. Simone sets herself up as everybody's doormat - and then wonders why her life falls out from under her. This isn't love, folks. It's seduction, betrayal and lust; which has nothing to do with love. The caring thing for Simone to do would have been to walk away - transfer Annabelle to another classroom, another school, or leave the school herself if she felt her life was getting out of control

Once the ""love story"" begins, we see no teaching take place. The other students are portrayed as either hostile or understanding, but no one seems to care what is happening to anyone's education, including Annabelle's.

There's a reason the rules exist about teachers and students - and it's not just because people ""don't understand."" It's because they do. Don't support this tripe. Students everywhere deserve better, and teachers who exhibit this behavior deserve no excuse.",1175472000,21,1448,4.878048780487805

Last week I purchased ""Loving Annabelle"" and ""Show Me Love (aka ""F**king Amal"").  I enjoyed both, but I have found myself watching ""Loving Anabelle"" several times, most recently, I watched it again today with the Director's Comments on.  This film was not the greatest lesbian film ever, but it never set out to be!  This is a film that is absolutely fueled by passion--the passion of the director, the passion of the actors and the passion of the characters--and you know what? It really works.  Yeah, the acting is a bit difficult at times---but HEY they shot the thing in 20 days on an indie budget and they'd only found 'their Simone' like 3 days before they started to shoot. All in all...I think they did damn well...because when Simone and Annabelle get together, it's pretty hot and believable. I really didn't have a problem with the subject matter because I thought this to be a film in the tradition of Madchen in Uniform and not totally reflective of reality (but then again who hasn't had that secret crush on a teacher?).

At any rate--I found it enjoyable and one of the better lesbian films out there.  (Oh, and ""Show Me Love"" is pretty cute too--though more about ""coming of age"" than ""coming out"").",1175472000,4,1372,4.5528455284552845

The cinematography is gorgeous.  Katherine Brooks has a real eye for color, scene selection and lighting.  Though the subject is dark and troubling, the film feels warm and soft.  The writing is compelling as you can't help but cheer on something you know isn't right.  Remember singing that song by the Police ""Don't Stand So Close To Me,"" because it's so catchy?

Not only is the movie incredibly short (a few minutes over an hour, which in and of itself makes it not warrant a $20 price tag), but it is also incredibly bad. Whether it be from a bad script (which it was) or by bad performances, the piece lacked a certain depth that is required for a good movie. This could have been a very good film - it had all the potential, but that potential was never realized.

Lesbian cinema is somewhat lacking in good films. Are we so desperate that we clutch onto any movie we can and call it good? There are standouts like 'Fire', 'When Night Is Falling', and more recently, 'Nina's Heavenly Delights.' Those films are not only contain good, well-rounded plots where even secondary characters are not two-dimensional, but they feature excellent acting performances.

I am a hopeless romantic, and more than anything I want the girl to get the girl in the end. What's unfortunate about this film is that I didn't care in the end if that happened.

The love scene is the sexiest I've seen in a movie ever. The ending is sad, but realistic in the times we live in, but you do feel compassion for Simone.

Kathrine Brooks did a wonderful job on arranging and shooting this movie, with an excellent choice with Diane Gaidry (""America so Beautiful"", ""The Dogwalker"" ...) and Erin Kelly (""Finding Kate"", but this movie was basically her first, I think).

2667311,4,B000J4QWIG,"This new 'hottest movie around' tells a poignant story full of taboo, passion, and hidden lives brimming at the surfaces of these women as they fall deeper into each others worlds.  You're carried along watching Simone's more mature ""self"" struggle to resist the younger, beautiful, and obviously very enlightened, student.  Rebellious Annabelle is young and doesn't demonstrate any real concept of consequence, and is focused on acting on her feelings and thoughts.  This story is tender, real, controversial and compelling.  The film quality is excellent, even if the acting isn't exactly top notch.  Stil, the women and settings are beautiful!  YES, there is seduction, obviously, and man is it wonderful!  The women are just lovely, both actresses are completely sexy and intriguing.  I didn't like the ending, but it absolutely dismantles the ""double standard"" question and says that it isn't OK to seduce students! (but you can also click the 'alternate ending' option in the bonus section to get a happier ending) I loved the way Simone's past was revealed bit by bit along the way; her struggle with heartache and vulnerability - but while possessing intellect and strength at the same time - was so intriguing.  The evolving and maturing Annabelle was refreshing, but so was her youthful tenacity in holding on to her own set of values.  The way they ultimately let the barrier between them melt away, and find themselves relating as women, unfolds in the ""beach house"" scene.  Very touching.  I take away 1 star for not developing this as much as it could have been, therefore, ending it in one hour. The love scene between the women is smokin' hot!",1170547200,58,1659,4.992727272727273

The only thing that I would change would be the ending!,1169337600,3,306,4.05
2667338,5,B000J4QWIG,This is a wonderfuly written and directed movie. All of the actors give moving and compelling performances. I highly recomend this movie.,1169251200,8,137,5.2727272727272725
2667339,4,B000J4QWIG,I loved the movie. The acting was very good and the plot was well detailed. I wished the movie had been longer and better produced the characters. I hated the ending. Very good movie!,1169164800,2,183,4.411764705882353
2667340,3,B000J4QWIG,"I must admit, when it comes to Lesbian Films, most suck. This one didn't, but it wasn't as good as it could have been. The acting seemed a bit stiff to me and there was a lack of emotion and tension. Also the topic was moralisticly questionable. I know these relationships occur, but should they? Should a 30 something year old woman accept the advances of a 16 year old girl?  As far as endings go, this one was different and not how people expect 'love stories' to end, but totally appropriate considering the topic and the people involved. If you want to see a nice Lesbian love story with a happy ending, lots of tension and emotion, see 'When Night is Falling'.",1169078400,22,666,4.414634146341464
2667341,5,B000J4QWIG,Ok so who hasn't had some sort of fantasy about their teacher!?  This was the closest I would ever have gotten to experiencing such a fantasy in spite of having spent most of my life in Catholic school!  What I enjoyed most was the  relationship between Annabelle and Simone and the way that they clicked on-screen. This movie would be a valuable addition to any lesbian flick collection!!,1168992000,2,389,4.6911764705882355
2667342,5,B000J4QWIG,"I just finished watching this film. Wow. This was a fantastic film, and I'm amazed that it was made with such a small budget because it was extremely well done. The acting is great, and the story is both believable and deeply emotional; the dialogue and the characters make the story seem perfectly real. Katherine Brooks did an amazing job capturing real emotion, and she told a great story. Normally, I don't think I would be rooting for a student-teacher relationship, but this film was able to capture the image of true love and how love can't be stopped even by society's boundaries; I definitely supported Simone and Annabelle. Erin Kelly (Annabelle) made her character very believable, and Diane Gaidry (Simone) was able to show many emotions without words. The schoolgirls also did wonderful jobs conveying their characters.

I highly recommend this film, but only watch it if you have an open mind.",1168905600,5,907,4.928104575163399
2667343,4,B000J4QWIG,I would have to say it was a good buy.  You get so much into the story of their lives that you forget that it is a student and a teacher.  I recommend adding it to your DVD collection.,1168905600,,184,3.6923076923076925
2667344,4,B000J4QWIG,"This film was enjoyable, well executed, and had a great plot. The fantastic acting of Diane Gaidry and Erin Kelly is what truly made this film so great- they had great chemistry, too.",1168905600,2,183,4.575757575757576
2667345,4,B000J4QWIG,"Considering the genre of the film, as well as the subject matter, I found it to be fresh and tasteful.  Working with a limited budget must have been so difficult, but the combined talents of director and actors provided quite a chemistry.  The ending was hard but true to life.  Once we make our own bed we must lie in it, so to speak.",1168819200,4,335,4.203125
2667346,4,B000J4QWIG,"I am a movie buff. I like to venture into different genres that I normally don't watch on a regular basis. I don't watch a heckuvalot of films in the GLBT genre but every now and then I will find one that catches my attention. I recently saw the film ""Loving Annabelle"" starring Erin Kelly as the rebellious and passionate Annabelle and Diane Gaidry as the kind but guarded Simone. Simone is a teacher at a all girls Catholic boarding school. Annabelle is the daughter of a powerful senator who is sent to Simone's school after being expelled from the last school she attended. Annabelle winds up being in Simone's poetry class. Initially the two women clash but eventually their personality differences are tempered when they begin to get to know each other better. Eventually the women's friendship goes beyond platonic which leads to the issue of teacher/student relationship. Instead of making Simone look like a sexual predator, director Katherine Brooks portrays Simone in a more sympathetic light. Simone is plagued with guilt for developing strong romantic feelings for Annabelle.

I loved ""Loving Annabelle"" immensely. The writing was strong. The dialogue was not remotely corny as a lot of gay themed films are unfortunately plagued with. I loved both actresses Erin Kelly and Diane Gaidry. My only gripe with the film was the ending but that was out of Katherine Brooks' control and had no choice to really end the film the way that it did. The alternative wasn't any better. It was vague and short otherwise loved the film.",1168646400,,1535,4.903846153846154
2667347,4,B000J4QWIG,"Due to late casting of Simone it is very clear that Erin is more comfortable in her role that Diane is in hers, and that works in the film's favour.  Yes, there are quick cuts where it is obvious that it was filmed on a limited budget, but that just makes the viewer have to work a little bit harder, be less passive in their viewing.  All too real a scenario.  Well worth a visit, and a reunion to boot.",1168473600,,404,4.025
2667348,4,B000J4QWIG,"IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING MOVIE! THE ONLY THING THAT MADE ME GIVE IT 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5, IT WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH AND COULD OF HAD A MORE DETAILED ENDING. ALL IN ALL I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT!",1168473600,3,187,3.8205128205128207
2667349,5,B000J4QWIG,"I truly enjoyed this film. Finally a different point of view, when your emotions get the very best of you, and can not help them. I can feel for the character being play by Diana Gaidry. A teacher caught having these feeling for this student and fighting with her heart and mind as to what is right and wrong, and knowing there is nothing you can do about.",1168300800,,356,4.25
2667350,5,B000J4QWIG,I have probably watched almost every lesbian film out there and this is the best one I have ever seen.  The actors were AMAZING!  They drew you into the film until you felt every emotion that they felt.  The love conveyed was true and deep.  Loving Annabelle is right up there with Fingersmith and Tipping the Velvet and may even be better.  If you haven't seen it and you love films about love and attraction you need to see this movie!,1167955200,,437,4.345679012345679
2667351,4,B000J4QWIG,"Diane Gaidry (Simone) and Erin Kelly (Annabelle) create such gently compelling and layered characters, that this movie becomes memorable in the best of ways. Gaidry's skill at imparting Simone's surface hush veiling an unhappy past, and an awakening passion beneath is totally convincing.",1167782400,,288,5.72093023255814
2667352,5,B000J4QWIG,"This is one of the best lesbian films ! I saw it on a lesbian film festival in germany. Erin Kelly and Diane Gaidry are wonderful actors ! They make this film an really experience ! Im very glad that i can get this film from amazon USA, because in germany its not available.",1167177600,2,274,4.092592592592593
2667353,4,B000J4QWIG,"Before I start, please understand that I waited a very long time to see this movie and supported the filmmakers on myspace.  I saw it in the theaters and was too excited to truly pay attention (and distracted by the laughter of my fellow viewers).  I have the DVD and have watched it many times.  Unfortunately, after several viewings, I've found many problems with the movie.  The editing is choppy and not chronological (Simone wearing necklace, then not wearing it, and then wearing it again).  The deleted scenes should not have been deleted, although director Katherine Brooks, who is talented, claims that the scenes were deleted to avoid being melodramatic.  The movie is melodramatic, so the scenes should not have been cut.  As a result, the movie is too short and leaves you with the feeling that you want more.  Finally, the ending is abrupt and leaves too many questions.  I too prefer the alternate ending.  KB states that she chose the most realistic ending, but that seems odd considering the whole concept of this relationship is unrealistic.  To fulfill my fantasies, I would have preferred the ""happily ever after"" ending.  But maybe that's why I don't write movies.

However!  In the genre of lesbian film, this movie is by far more superb than most out there.  There are hints of influences from other lesbian flicks, but Annabelle is definitely superior.  The cinematography is beautiful and the music is perfect.  Overall, this will be a lesbian film classic.",1167091200,5,1481,4.907258064516129
2667354,5,B000J4QWIG,"First off I wanted to say how much I loved the movie.  I have watched it everyday since I got it.  Ok so here is my question.  On the deleted scenes they open with the first meeting and I don't know if it's just my dvd or everybody's is this, but I only have sound for like two seconds between Simone and Annabelle.  Was it my dvd or was everyone else's like that?  Please let me know.  Thank you...",1167091200,,399,3.9873417721518987

don't these two women have a right to happiness?

Does this dvd have the alternate ending and deleted scenes on it?  If so, I would buy this dvd.

The movie 'Loving Annabelle' should have been at least  one hour and thirty-five minutes long.",1516579200,,404,4.782608695652174
