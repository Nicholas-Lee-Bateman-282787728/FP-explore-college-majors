8276901,4,B001AD1NE8,"Like the other reviewers, I saw this as a child and its images were branded into my imagination for the rest of my life.  Newlyweds are visiting the castle of the old family in Germany, which was the base of operation of a medieval fanatic and torturer.  The wife hears screams in the night.  Upon investigation, she discovers a woman in an iron maiden, her eyes gouged out.  She screams and when she wakes up, no one will tell her what is going on, insisting it was just a bad dream.  The servants are all bizarrely taciturn and unhelpful and there is a strange American seen on the grounds, watching and snooping around.  Who is the perpetrator?  Who can she trust?  Even her husband is acting strangely.  It is so scary, and the tortures so ghastly, that the viewer forgets the strangeness and plot inconsistencies.  I will not reveal what is happening, but it is surprising and completely unforseeable.

Warmly recommended for nostalgia and as good for nightmares.",1444262400,,968,4.7023809523809526
8276902,5,B001AD1NE8,"This movie has about everything. A European castle, mysterious in it's history and inhabitants, complete with hidden passages and a torture chamber in the basement which somebody is using! Mysterious castle inhabitants, including the husband of the woman who seems to be the only one who does not have any idea what is really happening. Christopher Lee, who together with the husband, know more than they are telling. WWII Nazis and an F.B.I. agent investigating the castle and it's inhabitants indirectly. A monster who supposedly lurks about the castle wearing an old outfit worn by a medieval torturer, probably the one who has been using the torture devices on those staying at the castle, and you get to see how! You also get a weird 60's easy jazz soundtrack. Two hot women in this movie too, though they are not showing as much as in a typical Hammer film. One gets her face gnawed on by a rat in the torture chamber. This combination of plot and characters actually comes together into a nice thriller symphony. You'll find yourself wondering along with the wife what is going on, until the very end. Highly recommended, and I watch enough classic horror to know.",1419206400,4,1171,4.801980198019802
8276903,4,B001AD1NE8,This film was done in the early sixties and Christopher Lee is part of the cast.  You will find this film dubbed since it was done in Italy.  I liked it as a horror flick.  The story is not your typical horror plot. I would recommend adding this film to your collection.,1385596800,2,270,4.153846153846154
8276904,3,B001AD1NE8,"""Horror Castle"", a.k.a. ""The Virgin Of Nuremerg""!!! The latter version can go for almost $10 more. I've never had the chance to compare quality between them but I own the ""Virgin"" release and it looks great ~",1346803200,6,208,4.648648648648648
8276905,3,B001AD1NE8,"OK movie. Not great. If you collect Horror Castle movies, this would be a reason to buy this movie. It is Italian, so you automatically figure LOW BUDGET. It is dubbed in English.",1318118400,,179,4.454545454545454
8276906,5,B001AD1NE8,"I first saw this film at a drive-in triple feature (remember them?) when I was ten years old and it scared the crap out of me!  About three years ago I finally found a copy on DVD and gave it a watch.  And it was just as good as I remembered.  I'm not going into the plot as that would spoil it, but just to say this is one really creepy title with lots of red herrings to keep you guessing.  Christopher Lee doesn't have a large part, but it's always good to have him around for this sort of thing. And the rat scene, well, I just ate, so we won't be going there!  This is a lot of fun if you like creepy goings on in an eerie castle with a lot of strange characters.  Good fun and recommended!",1295136000,8,695,3.893617021276596
