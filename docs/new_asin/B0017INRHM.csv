3172894,1,B0017INRHM,"The concept is great. ""Raising Jeffrey Dahmer"" sets out to be a dramatization of what the family members went through when the horrid crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer came out of hiding. Now, seriously, for a film that is supposed to be highly performance based you'd think they would have good actors. Nope. Not here. Every scene drags on endlessly and the actors obviously have no idea who it is that they are portraying. I would expect Lionel Dahmer to be represented as more than just a fat putz that goes ""What? Oh no. Oh no I can't believe it. Oh man this is bad.""

In the end, this is just a great idea gone horribly wrong.",1257033600,,622,4.362068965517241
3172895,3,B0017INRHM,"I think Dahmer and Manson were brilliant people, and thats the only reason it got 3 stars. The movie was extremely boring and was uninformative. I half wish I could have rented this movie before I bought it. The acting was poor, and poorly casted. None the less I am glad I have the movie now because it is about Dahmer...",1246924800,,322,4.295081967213115
3172896,1,B0017INRHM,"this movie seriously doesn't even deserve ONE star, but i don't think i could have written the review had i not marked it.  i can't even believe i'm sitting here after wasting, what... an hour and a half, two hours of my time???  i guess i'm just running off of pure adrenaline... i am BEYOND irritated with myself that i didn't turn the movie off within the first five minutes like i thought to do.  curiosity just got the best of me i suppose... i kept thinking that something of informative value was going to come up at some point, but no... NOTHING.

every single thing about this movie was just AWFUL.  i could go on and on, but honestly, i've already wasted enough of my time.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.  seriously... go watch paint dry... i assure you you'll have more fun.",1223251200,7,779,4.368055555555555
3172897,1,B0017INRHM,"First, this is a movie that shows that Lionel Dahmer is not all there in the head. This movies shows that he knew what Jeffery was up too. The movie didn't really explain much. Too much flash backs. I think that lionel just showed how stupid he was. This movie made me angry. I am was anting to see what was going through the mind of the family at the time frame. This movie should be tossed in the trash because that is all it is. what i saw int his movie..Lionel should be arrested  also. he was a lousy father and he knew what Jeffery was doing. The acting is terrible in the movie. Very low budget looking. Another thing I didn't like they actind like Jefferys mom was dead. They really didn't explain much about her. The people that made this movie should hide out of embrassment. because this was on  of the worst movies in history.",1221955200,,838,4.264150943396227
3172898,1,B0017INRHM,"I have studied Jeffrey Dahmer since I was fifteen years old, I am now almost 30. I remember getting ready for school one morning and seeing the developing story on the news. I was instantly fascinated, to say the least. I would consider myself an expert on Jeffrey Dahmer's crimes and his life, so I had to give this film a chance, out of curiosity's sake.

I can't tell you how the movie is, because I didn't make it through the first two minutes. The opening sequence of the movie is so horrible that I just knew it would be a complete waste of my time if I continued to watch such garbage. The hokey music that plays over his trial is corny and makes it almost comical, then they show the scene where he kills his first victim, which is also corny and phony.

From what I saw, this movie is a joke.",1220140800,2,801,4.194805194805195
3172899,2,B0017INRHM,"This is a very amateurish production that tells us almost nothing about how Jeffrey Dahmer might have come by the fetishes that made him one of the most bizarre serial killers of the century.

Dahmer is an anomaly in the pantheon of serial killers in that he does not seem to have himself been the victim of real verbal or physical abuse as he was growing up. His biological parents were divorced and Jeffrey was largely raised by his father and stepmother. But his stepmother was no Grimm's fairytale figure. All the adults in his life appear to have been relatively intelligent and supportive. So the mystery of his pathology remains. And that's all this movie shows - his father being mystified.

This movie does show Jeffrey's father speculating that the boy might have gotten twisted by the prescription drugs his mother grew dependent on during her pregnancy. Other than that one little piece of biographical information though, there's nothing substantive here. And the production values of this indie film are so poor, the film is almost unwatchable sometimes.

Whenever the narrative is told in flashback, which it frequently is, the Director decided to use a bleached out, somewhat smudged effect on the film. This makes the actors look as if they were performing in an early 1950's TV episode shown in its fragile kinescope original.

The actors also perform as if they were in an early 1950's soap opera. They sit in suspended animation, in slow, eternally unresolved anguish. When we skip ten years and tune in again, we find we haven't missed a thing. Husband and wife are seated on the same worn couch - against the same dingy, minimalist background. They are still there in long-drawn surmise. ""How did all those animals die? But surely, Jeff was just collecting road-kill.""

No, there's nothing new to be learned here. The Director's Commentary on this DVD is a little livelier than the movie itself. However anyone interested in the psyche of this serial killer would do better to check out ""Dahmer"" starring Jeremy Renner or one of the other indie films that focus on Jeffrey himself. These other films, while not explaining Dahmer's obsessions, do give the viewer a better feel for Dahmer's need to totally possess and become one with his victims.",1218931200,18,2267,4.893229166666667
3172900,1,B0017INRHM,"Do not waste your time. This was very VERY lame. I do not believe that is how Lionel and Shari were...at all. They made him seem so naive to what his son was doing. If he really was that naive, he should be classified as mildly retarded.",1215388800,3,237,4.0638297872340425
3172901,3,B0017INRHM,"I love it when I learn that books I enjoyed had film adaptations completed.  It was four years after I read Gore Vidal's book that I learned that ""Myra Breckenridge"" (sp?) was made into a film.  I loved Abraham Verghese's first book and was pleased that Marisa Tomei performed in its film adaptation.  I read Lionel Dahmer's book and just knew I had to see how it was going to be visualized.

It must be stressed that this film focuses on Jeffrey Dahmer's father and stepmother, rather than the murderer himself.  In the same way that Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" said close to nothing of the horrific class inequality of late 18th-century France, this doesn't look at the world from Jeffrey Dahmer's eyes, or with a bird's eye view of him.  This is also a bit like how ""Cry Freedom"" did not focus on Steven Biko, but on a white supporter of his.

Maybe a ton of people read that book and I didn't know about it.  Since the Dahmer controversy happened a little under 20 years ago, I am not sure how many film viewers remember it or would want to meditate on it now.  9/11 and other matters from this decade may have brushed Dahmer off the table.  The Columbine murders may also have had that same influence.  The actors here don't have bad timing like in many low-budget flicks, but some may be aggravated by how slowly the film moves.  Further, the work is filmed in drab and sun-erased colors that may annoy many.  Still, if you are horrified by the facts behind Dahmer's murders, they barely come up here at all.  Perhaps, they feel the first two (or more?) films on Dahmer have already portrayed that effectively.  This movie doesn't portray Lionel's response to Jeffrey's murder and I wish it had.  To me, the transition from killer's father to victim's father would probably have been profound.

It doesn't take energy for me to absolve Lionel Dahmer.  There is no proof whatsoever that he abused, raped, or neglected his son.  Yes, in this film, Lionel comes off as very passive and naive.  I do wonder if he was more concerned with life in his lab than that at home.  Still, I am sure many a father don't want to be held accountable for what their crazy-butt adult sons do!  When you read Lionel's book, his meditations on ""Was I the cause of this!?"" are acceptable.  However, this meditating may have not translated well to film.  This film may seem ""plotless"" to many viewers.  It held my interest because I was watching the book being made visual, but those who haven't read the book might not sit through this.

Sometimes in film, sons have chin dimples and fathers don't, or vice versa, but this work hired two actors with very pronounced chin dimples.  It could not have been coincidence!  If the real Jeffrey Dahmer had a chin dimple, it was a slight one.",1214697600,9,2770,4.552631578947368

It was very interesting and gave a new perspective on how his immediate family was (or at least portrayed), which then gives an interesting insight on how Dahmer became the iconic serial killer he was.

3172943,1,B0017INRHM,"I am from Milwaukee WI originally. One of my close friends was a cousin of the 2 brothers that Dahlmer killed & who eventually led to him being caught. So I was very familiar with this case, plus I had previously read a book about Dahlmer & his crimes (which by the way was BRUTALLY GRAPHIC & not for the faint of heart!) I am a True Crime buff, I am interested in what makes ppl tick & do the things they do. So I have read many books on serial killers & watch a lot of true crime movies.

That being said, this was the WORST! Seriously, as I chose to watch it, I had a nervous feeling in my stomach, like maybe I shouldn't watch this. Even having read many true crime novels, Dahlmer's story was by far, the worst I have ever read! The writer was a good writer, too good for this type of story, which allowed his words to easily put images in ur head no one should see. It was hard to sleep for weeks, trying to get those images out of my mind. This movie however, barely even explained what he was in prison for! If I had not lived it, & read about it, I would be clueless after watching this movie. At one point it mentions, they found body parts in his apartment for at least 3 separate victims. Then they show the news calling him a serial killer of at least a dozen victims. Finally, at one point the Dad mentions a memory, that Jeff killed his 1st victim in their home & buried him nearby.

THAT'S IT! I knew based on the trailer, it was from the Dad's perspective, & wouldn't most likely be overly graphic. However, this barely even gave the viewer enough information to even understand what the man was in jail for. Instead, it was extremely slow paced, like practically real time minutes, w/bad acting, & weird pauses w/gaps in the script, when things would be said, or something would happen, then the w/no explanation, or closure, the scene would just change, in a way that seemed as bad as cutting someone off mid-sentence.

One of the worst, most boring movies I have ever watched. Honestly if u want to know more about Dahlmer, or his crimes, go to the library, this is not worth the time. HORRIBLE! THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST HAD THE DAD DO A DOCUMENTARY, IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE WORSE OR MORE BORING THEN THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!",1444521600,,2239,4.263529411764706

3172945,5,B0017INRHM,"This movie was fascinating, especially because it is all true.

This movie is told from Lionel's view and memories, as the father who raised Jeffrey.
I really felt for Lionel.
I could feel his guilt and pain and shock over being the father of a serial killer.

I would have liked more information, such as :

Was Jeffrey actually born messed up, because his mother was an addict before she became pregnant with him, and all during her pregnancy?
People are born to addicts and don't become like Jeffrey, but that doesn't mean that Jeffrey's mother's drugs didn't mess him up.
This is probably an unanswerable question.

Did the grandmother (Catherine) recover after the stroke?
I thought that Catherine knew lots of secrets about Jeffrey, and keeping it all inside made her sick.

What happened to Jeffrey's mother (Joyce)?
Lionel went into Joyce's house and found 18-year-old Jeffrey there, getting high with two other people, and doing some kind of satanic seances.
When Lionel asked Jeffrey where Joyce was, he just kept saying that he didn't know.
So, what happened to Joyce?
I don't believe that Jeffrey did not know.

The attorney said that no judge would find Jeffrey incompetent.
So, Jeffrey was not mentally ill?
How could he do the things that he did and be sane?
I have heard about babies born ""without a conscience"" and other problems like that, and they are completely sane and just completely messed up.

It was touching to see Lionel and Shari and Catherine continue to love Jeffrey no matter what he did.
A real family loves a child, no matter how old he gets, and no matter what he does.
These were amazing, loving people, to be able to still love Jeffrey and stick by him after what he did.
It was also touching to see the way that Shari cared for Catherine.

It is horrible that the media told lies about the family.
Jeffrey was messed up since very early childhood, and I don't think that the father and stepmother and grandmother did anything to make him that way, and I don't think that there was anything that they could have done to prevent what he did or to help him, because he was just too messed up.

Lionel and Shari and Catherine were loving people who did not deserve the shame that Jeffrey brought upon them.
It is amazing that Lionel and Shari supported each other and loved each other and stayed together, through everything that Jeffrey did from the very beginning until after his death.
What happened to all of them after Jeffrey's death?
Through everything, did Lionel or Shari lose their jobs?

No other family was mentioned.  Was there anyone else?  What about the family's friends?

Did Jeffrey lie to people, saying that his father sexually abused him and that his stepmother beat him and abused him?
Or did people just come forward and lie to the media just to get attention?

When Lionel spoke to the reporters, I thought that what he said was wonderful, especially when he apologized on behalf of his son, to the families of the victims.",1443571200,,2981,4.66412213740458

Yes, a father with a heart who married an alky the first time and produced a son with warped perceptions has more to do with the mother, in my opinion!  She took drugs as well and the potentiating effects of drugs combined with alcohol cannot be underestimated or discounted.  The current gen of self-absorbed and selfish people is an epidemic in this Nation.  That's obvious from reading any newspaper on any day of the week.  Doctors are as much to blame, maybe more so for the chemical imbalance in many people.  The blood/brain barrier has been permeated with drugs prescribed by physicians, who had little or no understanding of how those Rx's would have a detrimental and long-lasting effect and affect on people's behavior from infancy onward when given to the mothers.

3172971,1,B0017INRHM,"This movie is based upon the true story of Jeffrey Dahmer, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who was arrested July 22, 1991. He had a curiousness about dead animals and became an alcoholic, serial killer and a habitual sex offender. He had murdered 16 men and boys between 1978-1991. His murders involved rape, dismemberment, necrophilia and cannibalism.
  His court trial began in 1992 and was very well publicized by the media.
  The movie is dramatized from the Dahmer's family point of view as Jeff was imprisoned.
  In 1991, Lionel Dahmer (Scott Cordes) receives a call at work from the police about his son Jeff (Rusty Sneary) being under arrest for a homicide. He contacts the grandmother and she says the police have a warrant to search inside her house, where Jeff used to live. He notifies his wife, Sherri (Cathy Barnett), who runs off a verbal list of what could have Jeff done now. However, she disregards everything Jeff has done as a child.
  Lionel talks with his disturbed son at the police station. Then we see how Lionel deals with the crowd of reporters at home.
  Flashbacks explore Jeffrey's childhood and adult life-style.

Please remember every one in this film is an actor.

  This is an independent film, so do not expect this movie to be of the same calibur as a motion picture from a major studio.

  You will not see any implied or explicit scenes or violence with minors in this film.

Also in the cast: Frankie Krainz, Erin McGrane, Kip Niven, Ric Huerill.

 Co-producer Bo Svenson played ""Detective John Amos"".

3407391,1,B0017INRHM,"The concept is great. ""Raising Jeffrey Dahmer"" sets out to be a dramatization of what the family members went through when the horrid crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer came out of hiding. Now, seriously, for a film that is supposed to be highly performance based you'd think they would have good actors. Nope. Not here. Every scene drags on endlessly and the actors obviously have no idea who it is that they are portraying. I would expect Lionel Dahmer to be represented as more than just a fat putz that goes ""What? Oh no. Oh no I can't believe it. Oh man this is bad.""

In the end, this is just a great idea gone horribly wrong.",1257033600,,622,4.362068965517241

Too much flash backs. I think that lionel just showed how stupid he was. This movie made me angry. I am was anting to see what was going through the mind of the family at the time frame. This movie should be tossed in the trash because that is all it is. what i saw int his movie..Lionel should be arrested  also. he was a lousy father and he knew what Jeffery was doing. The acting is terrible in the movie. Very low budget looking. Another thing I didn't like they actind like Jefferys mom was dead. They really didn't explain much about her.

3407395,1,B0017INRHM,"I have studied Jeffrey Dahmer since I was fifteen years old, I am now almost 30. I remember getting ready for school one morning and seeing the developing story on the news. I was instantly fascinated, to say the least. I would consider myself an expert on Jeffrey Dahmer's crimes and his life, so I had to give this film a chance, out of curiosity's sake.

I can't tell you how the movie is, because I didn't make it through the first two minutes. The opening sequence of the movie is so horrible that I just knew it would be a complete waste of my time if I continued to watch such garbage. The hokey music that plays over his trial is corny and makes it almost comical, then they show the scene where he kills his first victim, which is also corny and phony.

From what I saw, this movie is a joke.",1220140800,2,801,4.194805194805195
3407396,2,B0017INRHM,"This is a very amateurish production that tells us almost nothing about how Jeffrey Dahmer might have come by the fetishes that made him one of the most bizarre serial killers of the century.

Dahmer is an anomaly in the pantheon of serial killers in that he does not seem to have himself been the victim of real verbal or physical abuse as he was growing up. His biological parents were divorced and Jeffrey was largely raised by his father and stepmother. But his stepmother was no Grimm's fairytale figure. All the adults in his life appear to have been relatively intelligent and supportive. So the mystery of his pathology remains. And that's all this movie shows - his father being mystified.

This movie does show Jeffrey's father speculating that the boy might have gotten twisted by the prescription drugs his mother grew dependent on during her pregnancy. Other than that one little piece of biographical information though, there's nothing substantive here. And the production values of this indie film are so poor, the film is almost unwatchable sometimes.

Whenever the narrative is told in flashback, which it frequently is, the Director decided to use a bleached out, somewhat smudged effect on the film. This makes the actors look as if they were performing in an early 1950's TV episode shown in its fragile kinescope original.

The actors also perform as if they were in an early 1950's soap opera. They sit in suspended animation, in slow, eternally unresolved anguish. When we skip ten years and tune in again, we find we haven't missed a thing. Husband and wife are seated on the same worn couch - against the same dingy, minimalist background. They are still there in long-drawn surmise. ""How did all those animals die? But surely, Jeff was just collecting road-kill.""

No, there's nothing new to be learned here. The Director's Commentary on this DVD is a little livelier than the movie itself. However anyone interested in the psyche of this serial killer would do better to check out ""Dahmer"" starring Jeremy Renner or one of the other indie films that focus on Jeffrey himself. These other films, while not explaining Dahmer's obsessions, do give the viewer a better feel for Dahmer's need to totally possess and become one with his victims.",1218931200,18,2267,4.893229166666667
3407397,1,B0017INRHM,"Do not waste your time. This was very VERY lame. I do not believe that is how Lionel and Shari were...at all. They made him seem so naive to what his son was doing. If he really was that naive, he should be classified as mildly retarded.",1215388800,3,237,4.0638297872340425
3407398,3,B0017INRHM,"I love it when I learn that books I enjoyed had film adaptations completed.  It was four years after I read Gore Vidal's book that I learned that ""Myra Breckenridge"" (sp?) was made into a film.  I loved Abraham Verghese's first book and was pleased that Marisa Tomei performed in its film adaptation.  I read Lionel Dahmer's book and just knew I had to see how it was going to be visualized.

It must be stressed that this film focuses on Jeffrey Dahmer's father and stepmother, rather than the murderer himself.  In the same way that Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" said close to nothing of the horrific class inequality of late 18th-century France, this doesn't look at the world from Jeffrey Dahmer's eyes, or with a bird's eye view of him.  This is also a bit like how ""Cry Freedom"" did not focus on Steven Biko, but on a white supporter of his.

Maybe a ton of people read that book and I didn't know about it.  Since the Dahmer controversy happened a little under 20 years ago, I am not sure how many film viewers remember it or would want to meditate on it now.  9/11 and other matters from this decade may have brushed Dahmer off the table.  The Columbine murders may also have had that same influence.  The actors here don't have bad timing like in many low-budget flicks, but some may be aggravated by how slowly the film moves.  Further, the work is filmed in drab and sun-erased colors that may annoy many.  Still, if you are horrified by the facts behind Dahmer's murders, they barely come up here at all.  Perhaps, they feel the first two (or more?) films on Dahmer have already portrayed that effectively.  This movie doesn't portray Lionel's response to Jeffrey's murder and I wish it had.  To me, the transition from killer's father to victim's father would probably have been profound.

It doesn't take energy for me to absolve Lionel Dahmer.  There is no proof whatsoever that he abused, raped, or neglected his son.  Yes, in this film, Lionel comes off as very passive and naive.  I do wonder if he was more concerned with life in his lab than that at home.  Still, I am sure many a father don't want to be held accountable for what their crazy-butt adult sons do!  When you read Lionel's book, his meditations on ""Was I the cause of this!?"" are acceptable.  However, this meditating may have not translated well to film.  This film may seem ""plotless"" to many viewers.  It held my interest because I was watching the book being made visual, but those who haven't read the book might not sit through this.

Sometimes in film, sons have chin dimples and fathers don't, or vice versa, but this work hired two actors with very pronounced chin dimples.  It could not have been coincidence!  If the real Jeffrey Dahmer had a chin dimple, it was a slight one.",1214697600,9,2770,4.552631578947368

3407440,1,B0017INRHM,"I am from Milwaukee WI originally. One of my close friends was a cousin of the 2 brothers that Dahlmer killed & who eventually led to him being caught. So I was very familiar with this case, plus I had previously read a book about Dahlmer & his crimes (which by the way was BRUTALLY GRAPHIC & not for the faint of heart!) I am a True Crime buff, I am interested in what makes ppl tick & do the things they do. So I have read many books on serial killers & watch a lot of true crime movies.

That being said, this was the WORST! Seriously, as I chose to watch it, I had a nervous feeling in my stomach, like maybe I shouldn't watch this. Even having read many true crime novels, Dahlmer's story was by far, the worst I have ever read! The writer was a good writer, too good for this type of story, which allowed his words to easily put images in ur head no one should see. It was hard to sleep for weeks, trying to get those images out of my mind. This movie however, barely even explained what he was in prison for! If I had not lived it, & read about it, I would be clueless after watching this movie. At one point it mentions, they found body parts in his apartment for at least 3 separate victims. Then they show the news calling him a serial killer of at least a dozen victims. Finally, at one point the Dad mentions a memory, that Jeff killed his 1st victim in their home & buried him nearby.

THAT'S IT! I knew based on the trailer, it was from the Dad's perspective, & wouldn't most likely be overly graphic. However, this barely even gave the viewer enough information to even understand what the man was in jail for. Instead, it was extremely slow paced, like practically real time minutes, w/bad acting, & weird pauses w/gaps in the script, when things would be said, or something would happen, then the w/no explanation, or closure, the scene would just change, in a way that seemed as bad as cutting someone off mid-sentence.

One of the worst, most boring movies I have ever watched. Honestly if u want to know more about Dahlmer, or his crimes, go to the library, this is not worth the time. HORRIBLE! THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST HAD THE DAD DO A DOCUMENTARY, IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE WORSE OR MORE BORING THEN THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!",1444521600,,2239,4.263529411764706

3407442,5,B0017INRHM,"This movie was fascinating, especially because it is all true.

This movie is told from Lionel's view and memories, as the father who raised Jeffrey.
I really felt for Lionel.
I could feel his guilt and pain and shock over being the father of a serial killer.

I would have liked more information, such as :

Was Jeffrey actually born messed up, because his mother was an addict before she became pregnant with him, and all during her pregnancy?
People are born to addicts and don't become like Jeffrey, but that doesn't mean that Jeffrey's mother's drugs didn't mess him up.
This is probably an unanswerable question.

Did the grandmother (Catherine) recover after the stroke?
I thought that Catherine knew lots of secrets about Jeffrey, and keeping it all inside made her sick.

What happened to Jeffrey's mother (Joyce)?
Lionel went into Joyce's house and found 18-year-old Jeffrey there, getting high with two other people, and doing some kind of satanic seances.
When Lionel asked Jeffrey where Joyce was, he just kept saying that he didn't know.
So, what happened to Joyce?
I don't believe that Jeffrey did not know.

The attorney said that no judge would find Jeffrey incompetent.
So, Jeffrey was not mentally ill?
How could he do the things that he did and be sane?
I have heard about babies born ""without a conscience"" and other problems like that, and they are completely sane and just completely messed up.

It was touching to see Lionel and Shari and Catherine continue to love Jeffrey no matter what he did.
A real family loves a child, no matter how old he gets, and no matter what he does.
These were amazing, loving people, to be able to still love Jeffrey and stick by him after what he did.
It was also touching to see the way that Shari cared for Catherine.

It is horrible that the media told lies about the family.
Jeffrey was messed up since very early childhood, and I don't think that the father and stepmother and grandmother did anything to make him that way, and I don't think that there was anything that they could have done to prevent what he did or to help him, because he was just too messed up.

Lionel and Shari and Catherine were loving people who did not deserve the shame that Jeffrey brought upon them.
It is amazing that Lionel and Shari supported each other and loved each other and stayed together, through everything that Jeffrey did from the very beginning until after his death.
What happened to all of them after Jeffrey's death?
Through everything, did Lionel or Shari lose their jobs?

No other family was mentioned.  Was there anyone else?  What about the family's friends?

Did Jeffrey lie to people, saying that his father sexually abused him and that his stepmother beat him and abused him?

3407446,4,B0017INRHM,"As a father, watching this I can only say the way the father loved his son to the bitter end is a testimony to him more than Jeff.  Yes, a father with a heart who married an alky the first time and produced a son with warped perceptions has more to do with the mother, in my opinion!  She took drugs as well and the potentiating effects of drugs combined with alcohol cannot be underestimated or discounted.  The current gen of self-absorbed and selfish people is an epidemic in this Nation.  That's obvious from reading any newspaper on any day of the week.  Doctors are as much to blame, maybe more so for the chemical imbalance in many people.  The blood/brain barrier has been permeated with drugs prescribed by physicians, who had little or no understanding of how those Rx's would have a detrimental and long-lasting effect and affect on people's behavior from infancy onward when given to the mothers.

3407468,1,B0017INRHM,"This movie is based upon the true story of Jeffrey Dahmer, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who was arrested July 22, 1991. He had a curiousness about dead animals and became an alcoholic, serial killer and a habitual sex offender. He had murdered 16 men and boys between 1978-1991. His murders involved rape, dismemberment, necrophilia and cannibalism.
  His court trial began in 1992 and was very well publicized by the media.
  The movie is dramatized from the Dahmer's family point of view as Jeff was imprisoned.
  In 1991, Lionel Dahmer (Scott Cordes) receives a call at work from the police about his son Jeff (Rusty Sneary) being under arrest for a homicide. He contacts the grandmother and she says the police have a warrant to search inside her house, where Jeff used to live. He notifies his wife, Sherri (Cathy Barnett), who runs off a verbal list of what could have Jeff done now. However, she disregards everything Jeff has done as a child.
  Lionel talks with his disturbed son at the police station. Then we see how Lionel deals with the crowd of reporters at home.
  Flashbacks explore Jeffrey's childhood and adult life-style.

Please remember every one in this film is an actor.

  This is an independent film, so do not expect this movie to be of the same calibur as a motion picture from a major studio.

  You will not see any implied or explicit scenes or violence with minors in this film.

Also in the cast: Frankie Krainz, Erin McGrane, Kip Niven, Ric Huerill.

 Co-producer Bo Svenson played ""Detective John Amos"".

8266173,1,B0017INRHM,"I don't even know where to begin. This movie makes ""The Amityville Horror"" seem like a hardboiled true to life story (spoiler: Amityville was a hoax). I have no idea what the filmmakers were trying to say with this flick, other than that it was very difficult on the parents and stepparent of the Milwaukee cannibal to go through the trials and tribulations that followed their son's arrest-- in that regard, it does well. The man playing Lionel Dahmer, while looking nothing like the man, is by far the best actor in the movie and stands out against a slew of bad actors. I got this DVD for a dollar and I should have saved my money-- the shiny copper of the pennies I spent would have been worth something someday.

This movie plays out like a bad fever dream, you have no idea what's going on at any given time because it's constantly flashing back to random points in history and then coming back to the present. There's one sequence where we visit the time of Dahmer's birth and the editor (or somebody in charge of editing) puts this filter on the screen that looks like it came out of Windows Movie Maker from the old XP days-- in fact, I'm pretty sure this movie was edited together on Windows Movie Maker on XP because everything from the visual quality to the quality of the sound is muted, stuffy and gives you the sense that everyone involved in making this insufferable trash had an inner ear infection at the time of production.

The movie also makes a lot of stuff up, too-- I'm not sure why the filmmakers felt the need to embellish a story like Dahmer's (I mean, what's there to embellish? It's the story of America's sickest serial killer, that's pretty good source material for a film) but they add in things like saying Jeff poured oil in a fish tank or that he killed his own dog or that the detective who investigated Dahmer's apartment committed suicide in front of Lionel Dahmer and his wife-- all fiction thrown in there for no reason. It adds nothing to the story and is insulting to those who know the story of Jeffery Dahmer and even more insulting to those who don't know the story of Dahmer's escapades.

I didn't even watch the special features, yet. I'm not sure there are any, to be perfectly honest-- I was so disgusted with this film that by the time it was over I felt concussed and physically tired because of how poorly made it was. I think I would have had more fun watching ""Dahmer VS Gacy"" or better yet, reading the Wikipedia article for Jeffrey Dahmer. This movie is a pitiful excuse for a film that was made over a weekend and then fire-wired onto an HP and edited together on Windows Movie Maker on Windows XP and then sent to Lionsgate who said ""Oh, we'll distribute it!"" and then pumped out to make as little money as possible. My only consolation is that I bought it used and that the filmmakers didn't receive any money from me for their incompetence. I also got it for free with a gift card so I can't feel too terrible about it. But if you're looking for a good movie about the Milwaukee cannibal, look anywhere else, because it's not here.",1483660800,5,3091,4.438380281690141
