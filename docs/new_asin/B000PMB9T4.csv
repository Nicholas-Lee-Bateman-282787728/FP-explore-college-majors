8192444,5,B000PMB9T4,"I had searched several times for a video of trains operating in the St. Louis, Mo, area, featuring Unioin Station. This video has virtually all of the railroads that served the area with most of the diesel-era locomotives and passenger trains (1969 - 1977). The only thing missing are the predecessor mainline steam locomotives and switchers. My entire family enjoyed watching this video.",1371859200,,388,5.174603174603175
