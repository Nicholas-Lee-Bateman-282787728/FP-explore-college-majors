Much to learn about Faith, Hope , Love and the

which seems to have forgotten these virtues and the
beauty of good relationships.

5071495,2,B007A36ZHM,"I have studied the life of Pope Pius XII for the last three years.  I have read Sr. Pascalina's own autobiography in German and a great many other books, in six languages, about Pius XII's life, including the Actes et Documents from the Vatican, now online.  I was quite perturbed at the inaccuracies in the life of both Sr. Pascalina and Pius XII which this film depicts.  I fear it was based on the largely fictional book, La Popessa.  Thank goodness an English translation of Sr. Pascalina's own autobiography is coming out in 2013 from St. Augustine Press, His Humble Servant: Sister M. Pascalina Lehnert's Memoirs of Her Years of Service to Eugenio Pacelli, Pope Pius XII [Paperback).  That should clear up a great many falsehoods evident in this TV movie. People who want to know what she was really like, and what Pius XII was really like, should read that instead of watching this untrustworthy work of fiction, ""God's Mighty Servant.""
To begin with, she was not the pope's secretary.  She was only his housekeeper and the manager of the Vatican warehouse.  There was no aide to the pope named Msgr. Wilson.  The pope's private secretary was a German Jesuit named Fr. Leiber, who had accompanied them from Germany and with whom Sr. Pascalina evidently got along well.  There was some friction between Msgr. Montini and Sr. Pascalina because some of their duties overlapped.  She had made enemies in the Vatican and when Pius XII died she was cast out and found herself friendless. In the 1950's she was asked by the Superior of her Order to write her autobiography, which was titled Ich Durfte Ihm Dienen (I was allowed to serve him).",1339459200,82,1642,4.75
5071496,5,B007A36ZHM,"While some parts are fictionalized, this is a very interesting and intriguing movie on Sr. Pascalina. As a matter of fact, my grams has learned from experience that she can't watch this movie when too tired, becasue she ends up sleeping with one eye open just to see what going to happen next! Very entertaining.",1339027200,4,312,4.6909090909090905
5071497,5,B007A36ZHM,"This is truly an awesome movie. As a US MArine, I must say that the church clergy has lost its way by becoming more secular, dumping their habit and resulting in child molesting and pregnancies....This movie also tells us how to behave respectful in all situations and positions, where a man and woman know their proper place and function instead of the rebellious, pervert and sinful divorces we have today....A good dvd to bring you back to reality of the standard how God will judge us later..Having lived in germany a short time i can tell you this Nun is awesome and truly genuine person with German discipline which has been lost today by lazyness.",1338508800,6,654,4.695652173913044
5071498,5,B007A36ZHM,I knew some of the story of Pope Pius 12 but this movie made me love him more.  He carried a heavy burden: how to help our older brothers in the faith without causing more harm. Diplomacy was a jagged road to walk and turning to God was the Pontiff's source of strength and wisdom. His need to be cared for by Sister reminds me of our need to be cared for by Our Lady. Pope Pius' strength and weakness made him so real.  The trial of discerning God's Will is a trial we all must face; I hope I can face it with great courage and prayer as did this great saint.,1337385600,16,560,3.9469026548672566
5071499,5,B007A36ZHM,"God's mighty servant is a very comprehensive biopic of the Sister Pascalina Lehnert, who served as Pope Pius XII's secretary and house keeper from 1917 to 1958. This film/ mini-series has tried to remain faithful to her life showing her humble origins as a farmer's daughter in Bavaria to being the confidant of the Pope. In this film we see a woman of great character and determination, and sanctity who loved to serve and did so perfectly, with that same efficiency that make Germans proud! However, she was also a woman of steel, who would not submit to any feigned or pretentious actions either by her subordinates of her superiors. One would get a sense of stubbornness, that would appear to be little more that pride, however it is not pride but a prayerful woman convinced of a calling to serve and serve she did. And if she had to weather a storm of controversy, she would face it head on! Despite these incidences, Sister Pascalina emerges strong and is not only a friend to the Pope, but  a sister and mother as well. And the fondness and mutual respect that they had for each other is beautifully depicted.

Our present Holy Father, before becoming Pontiff, apparently jokingly called Mother Pascalina ""The most powerful Bavarian in Vatican history'. Pope Benedict XVI continued, ""..........as housekeeper and secretary Madre Pascalina managed to create the human living space for Pius XII, which he needed, to fulfil his duties in a difficult time"".*

How did Sister Pascalina get to be where she was? How was she perceived by her superiors, fellow religious and the general public as a whole? What made her determined to be the servant of Cardinal Pacelli, who would later become Pope? What was the driving force behind her? How was she of assistance to this great pontiff during WWII? All these questions and many more are beautifully answered and well acted out in this film.

The movie claims to be based on real events.

One of the great lessons that this film teaches is that saintly people need not be doormats. Would it be presumptious of me to call her a saint? Perhaps....however Pope Pius XII was a saintly pontiff and I'm sure he would have directed his friend and secretary towards the Kingdom.

The part of the sister played by  Christine Neubauer is excellent. She looks like the real Sister Pascalina and truly brings out her character. The other members of the cast did no less a job.

The movie does drag a little, however at the end it is worth watching it for there is so little known about Sister Pascalina. This film is not a tearjerker. The practical approach of the character of Sr. Pascalina, the common sense she exudes, her moments of impatience, short-tempers and her devotion to the Pope gives no room for tears......or at least that's my humble opinion.

This film is in German with English subtitles. The running time is 200 minutes.

Unlike other releases of biopics on the Saints from Ignatius press, this does not come with a booklet and there are no special features.

A remarkable film on a remarkable woman in remarkable times!

5071500,5,B007A36ZHM,A great story.  Just loved it and I am happy that I bought it.  I will watch it again.,1427068800,,86,3.473684210526316
5071501,3,B007A36ZHM,"This video is in German.  It was made for a German audience.  It was well made and very interesting.  Most of the details are nicely done and it is a relatively fine portrayal of the life of Pope Pius XII from his years as a bishop in Germany as papal nuncio to his papacy and death.
The video will work on DVD players in the United States.
The only major problem with the movie is with the dubbing.  It has English sub-titles on the bottom of the screen and because of the format (which you cannot adjust) the bottom line of each sub-title does not display on the television screen.  This was quite irritating to me.
In spite of this, I was able to understand the vast majority of what was being said but I wish it was done better.
Having said this, the movie was nicely done and interesting.  While it was interesting, I did come away with the notion that the movie, since it was made in Germany, was a bit too celebratory of the German experience of Pope Pius XII.  The movie DID show the Nazis realistically and badly but little was shown of the extreme cruelty done by them.  It was just not shown or glanced over rather quickly.  The movie did show the threats made to Pius by them.  Also, the movie showed the ultimate arrival of the American forces in Rome in one quick frame, but told nothing about the post war years or for that matter, the happy, welcoming co-operation given to the United States by Pope Pius after the war ended.
Nothing of the post World War II years was covered at all.  The war ended (1945) and then it shows his last few days and death in 1958!  This was irritating but somehow I got the impression that it was a time and side of the popes life that was not of interest to the German producers of the film so they just didn't cover it because it did not look that wonderful to them.
I can understand that various nationalities will sometimes present stories in a way that makes them look good.  So the film is very German orientated to a good degree and this side is naturally slanted and does not exactly cover the full side of things.
Aside from this, the movie was interesting and nicely done if you concentrate on the life of Pope Pius himself.",1426550400,2,2181,4.30317848410758
5071502,1,B007A36ZHM,"This fiction is a great disservice to the memory of the holy persons it claims to portray, akin to calumny. Shame on Ignatius Press for publishing it.",1414800000,,150,4.592592592592593

5071513,2,B007A36ZHM,Didn't realize that the film was in a foreign language.  This would have been ok but for the fact that only some of the subtitles could be read.  So I couldn't possibly follow the film.  What a waste of money.  I am sure the film would have been good too.,1375920000,6,255,4.04
5071514,5,B007A36ZHM,"A wonderful revelation of the workings of the committees in the Vatican.

5071516,4,B007A36ZHM,"I am not going to argue about the factual accuracy of the details of Sister Pascalina Lehnert's life and relationship with to Pope Pius XII's.  She was assigned to him to be part of his household staff.  In time, the one-woman dynamo gave way to a staff but her position changed from house keeper to secretary and eventually friend during their 41-year (1917 - 58) relationship There are facts about her that remain, her loyalty, devotion to her ministry, her faith and courage.  Above all, she remained 'God's mighty servant"" and example of the type of person who serves the kingdom of God.  Sr. Pascalina came from a humble farming family, had an overbearing father and often had to check her strong character at the door but she always leaned on her faith and devotion to serving God, the Church and the pope.  The movie is in German and is beautifully made.  I recommend it to anyone who admires tenacity, faith and being a servant leader.",1364860800,10,943,4.650602409638554
5071517,5,B007A36ZHM,Chose this for the great Christian Content.  Great views of how the Vatican works and a great moving story of such a hard working Saint who followed her heart and the calling from God.,1364860800,,184,4.411764705882353
5071518,5,B007A36ZHM,Love this movie.  Tells us a lot about that time in history of the Papacy.  Pius XII and Sister Pascalina were a great team.,1363392000,,124,4.125
5071519,2,B007A36ZHM,"This was a very odd movie and I was surprised it was endorsed by the conservative Ignatius Press.  I know nothing about Sister Pascalina but I do know quite a bit about Catholic religious life and I certainly have never seen it presented like this before.  That a nun should be punished by making her go bare-headed is bizarre in the extreme.  What was all that about anyway?  And if you want to see a good movie about how the Church saved many Jews during World War II see ""Assisi Underground"", it tells the story much better.  Once again I am disappointed in a Catholic production.  If the people who put this together couldn't take the time to get the habit and head-dress correct for the nuns, I doubt they took the time to get anything else right.  Disappointing movie about a person who I imagine was quite interesting in real life.",1362614400,6,838,4.473684210526316

8513165,5,B007A36ZHM,This is a good movie based on a real person. She was obviously very talented. I don't like how she was treated sometimes - was she too pushy and overstepped her bounds or was it that the men in charge resented her influence?
