7817386,5,6301826671,"I was looking for as long a version of this film as possible.  I also kept in mind anything that KINO produces (that I have seen anyway) is of good quality.  The quality of this film is excellent.  It was made in 1925 (not 1927 as advertised... 1925 appears on the back view of the box), deals with Post-WWI Germany and some of the desperate measures women were faced with in a period of rampant hyper-inflation.  This KINO VHS was produced in 1990 and was (at least in 1990) the longest version to appear in the US.  The running time of this version is 96 min. (not 125 min. as advertised... the back of the box shows this as well).  Overall, this is an eyebrow raising historic film and I'm surprised KINO has not produced this version on DVD.",1346025600,3,745,4.323741007194244
7817387,2,6301826671,"Director Georg Wilhelm Pabst's ""The Joyless Street"" is one of the most censored and mutilated films in history.  The film premier on May 18, 1925 in Berlin.  The film was a sensation and launched the new reality movement in German filmmaking.

The film was based on Hugo Bettauer's 1924 serialized novel. The film version would propel Greta Garbo to international fame.

Bettauer would never see the premier of the film based on his novel.  On March  26, 1925, a national socialist thug shot him to death.  Bettauer had ironically written a highly controversial dystopian satirical novel, called ""A City Without Jews, A Novel About The Day After Tomorrow.""  The novel was about the expulsion of the Jews from Austria.  Bettauer, had he lived, would have seen his fictitious world become a prophetic reality in 1938.

The original version of Joyless Street was a dark study of life in hyper-inflation Vienna in the wake of the Great War.  It was about poverty and despair in a defeated country.  In the original film, as in the book, Pabst set out to tell the story how inflation destroyed the sundry spectrums of society and led to people to lives of impoverishment, desperation and despair.  Pabst would tell his story through the lives of two main characters, Marie and Greta.  Nielson would play Marie, a poverty stricken character with a brutal and cruel father who would prostitute herself for the man she loves but who despises her.  Greta would play Greta, the daughter of a foolish and sickly middle class bureaucrat, would would resist the temptation of easy money and prostitution.

The film shocked European governments.  England banned the film from public viewing.  Italy, France, Austria and elsewhere would show the film only after it had been considerably mutilated.

Americans thought that the only value of the film was the presence of Greta Garbo.  Curiously, Garbo was paid in American dollars rather than worthless German ones.

As a result, most of the available versions of this film were cut to make the international sensation Great Garbo the star the film over the top billed Asta Nielson, who played a woman driven to murder.

Over the years, Nielson's leading part in the film will almost entirely vanish like the Jews in Bettauer's novel.

Garbo was the second lead to the once legendary Asta Nielson.

Most of the story line involving Asta Nielson's character Maria Lechner was cut out of the film.

Most of the story line involving Warner Krauss' abhorrent butcher of Melchoir Street was cut out of the film.

Other story lines, involving other characters, were cut out or toned down.

International censorship removed these segments long ago.

They were deemed too controversial and too dangerously political.

When the film was released in America in 1927, Asta Nielson's character was edited out except for a brief part at the beginning.

In 1937, this version was re-released with synchronized music and sound effects.  It is this terrible version people have most likely seen.

The result of this censorious butchery is that the human tragedy that Pabst was intent on showing in ""Joyless Street"" was  replaced by a sappy happy Hollywood ending where an American saves Greta from a life of hunger, misery and prostitution.

Rumors persist that Marlene Dietrich had a part in this film.  There is no evidence that she ever had a role in this film.

The German actress Herta von Walther played the part of the woman in Butcher's line who comforts Greta when she collapsed.  In the original version, Herta had a bigger part that involved prostituting herself to the Butcher.

Herta Von Walther is Forgotten today, but she made four films with director Georg Wilhelm Pabst between the years 1925 and 1928. The four are Joyless Street, Secrets of a Soul, Love of Jeanne Ney, Abwege.

There is no record of director Georg Wilhelm Pabst having ever made any films with Marlene Dietrich.  Still the rumors persist.

In 1999, the Munich Filmmuseum partially restored this this film. A 16 mm reduction positive exists in the museum.

Today, the film is mostly remembered as the last European role the timorous, timid Greta Garbo played before coming to America with her mentor Maurice Stiller.  In the January 1932 edition of Photoplay magazine, Ruth Biery wrote, ""Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer paid her $250 a week to secure him for the movies.

It is hard to say, ""Joyless Street"" is a good or poor picture in its mutilated form but it did not harm Greta Garbo.",1152921600,8,4478,4.921228304405875
7817388,5,6301826671,"Director G.W. Pabst would later achieve considerable success with such films as PANDORA'S BOX and DIARY OF A LOST GIRL (both starring Louise Brooks), but while his earlier JOYLESS STREET is less sophistocated it is no less effective in its intense and gritty story of poverty and corruption in post-WWI Vienna.
Pabst was particularly noted for his realistic style, and the grainy, harsh look of the film serves well the story of a woman (the celebrated Asta Nielsen) driven to a life of prostitution and crime by her lover's betrayal.  Today, however, the film is chiefly recalled as one of Greta Garbo's first major films, and although somewhat occasionally stiff, Garbo acquits herself very well in the role of a woman who contemplates prostitution in an effort to provide for her suddenly destitute family.
Considered scandalous at the time of its release, THE JOYLESS STREET was frequently cut for distribution--particularly in America.  For many years the film existed only in edited form; the Kino video release, however, restores the film to its original form and length.  Recommended.",1022630400,13,1092,5.15819209039548
7817389,5,6301826671,"Perhaps the only reason why this film is remembered is for Greta Garbo's performance.  However, this story about the tough times in Vienna after the First World War is worth a look in itself.  Garbo appears in one of the film's sub-plots and, as noted, considers becoming a prostitute to make ends meet.  Her father looses all his money but she is saved by a Red Cross officer who loves her. Things do get quite tense and Garbo's performance is a highlight of the film.
As for the ""The Joyless Street"" being deary, I would say it gives us a picture of the times, which were bad indeed in Germany and Austria.  Pabst was a master film maker and his subjects, like the later Pandora's Box, explore the seemy side of society.  It is melodramatic at times but an interesting film that devotees of silent films will not want to be without.
The film quality is excellent and the music admirably fits the subject.",1003276800,13,906,4.5
