I highly recommend it to new homeschoolers, and anyone who is considering quitting.  Sometimes you just need encouragement, and advice for how to make it work.  Here it is.  She will encourage you that you can do this and don't give up-your children are worth it.  Her insights about the blessings of homeschooling are true too.  You will be so glad you decided to teach your children at home.  Get the dvd, you will find something to help you here.",1325894400,,564,4.346153846153846
8348080,5,B001YJZ9RK,"Here in Middle Tennessee, Ginger McCreery is something of a legend.  She was one of our pioneers - educating her children at home when that just wasn't done.  For years Ginger has talked with new home educators or folks just wanting to know more.  I keep Ginger's phone number available so I can provide it for locals interested in getting started in home education.  The video has been very well received.  The production is not fancy - just Ginger sitting in front of a camera and telling you about home education and answering frequently asked questions - including the one we all get.  ""What about socialization?""  The content is great - hence the five stars.  Independent reviewers for other distributors have enthusiastically endorsed this video.  We started home educating about 17 years ago.",1283904000,,799,4.947368421052632
