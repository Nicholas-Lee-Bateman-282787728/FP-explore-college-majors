But... don't buy T-Series brand.  T-Series brand is blurry and no English Subtitles.  Make sure it's Shemaroo.... Shows wonderful, original quality.",1434758400,,180,6.08
8442850,1,B004V2FWQU,"I bought this DVD expecting acceptable terms of quality... But YUCK!!! It is a VHS to DVD transfer with smudgy video and hissing audio...
There's also a Speed shift of 4% which is bugging... The logo is horrendous... Go for the Shemaroo version which is average... Not excellent... But miles better than this one.",1395273600,2,313,4.814814814814815
