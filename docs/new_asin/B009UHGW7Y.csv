5368809,5,B009UHGW7Y,I saw this on Netflix. I wasn't sure what to expect. The movie starts out a little slow but then picks up. I love a good British drama / mystery and this didn't disappoint. There were so many thing working in this film. It's worth a watch.,1379030400,4,239,4.1063829787234045
5368810,5,B009UHGW7Y,"What a delicious opportunity for Matthew Rhys to showcase his acting range -- all the way from horrid, spoiled, and debased aristocrat to humble but righteous hero underdog!  I'd always loved him in ""The Americans,"" but this movie is a real revelation.  Also a standout is Phoebe Nicholls as the dependable and sometimes slightly sinister Charlotte.  This was a solidly entertaining movie.",1375056000,3,389,5.241935483870968
5368811,5,B009UHGW7Y,"Matthew Rhys is the reason to see this film.  The story is a bit far fetched but Rhys is so interesting and likable that it's worth seeing.

There are no English subtitles so if you have a problem hearing or understanding British English you may miss some of the dialogue.",1372032000,11,272,4.42
5368812,5,B009UHGW7Y,"Great adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel, The Scapegoat, fantastic cast that includes many stage actors, completely believable in their roles. Matthew Rhys is extraordinary in his portrayal of the Doppelgnger or spirit double in whom good triumphs over evil. A twisting plot imbued with humor and the keen anxiety and emotion of Rhys, the central character, in his role as a concealed stranger seeking to covertly understand his sinister doubles motives. Gorgeous cinematography with great setting and supporting cast. Highly recommended.",1368489600,16,543,5.634146341463414
5368813,5,B009UHGW7Y,"I just watched THE SCAPEGOAT on Netflix streaming and, if there had been a Region One DVD available i would have bought it in a heartbeat. Really fine film, with Matthew Rhys and Eileen Atkins leading an excellent cast. Why no Region One????",1365984000,14,241,4.627906976744186
5368814,5,B009UHGW7Y,"I'm a fan of Matthew Rhys who is one of the stars of 'The Americans', currently on the FX channel, by way of Direct TV.  After watching him in this version of 'The Scapegoat', when it appeared on The Ovation Channel, I knew I had to have a DVD of this program.  But, where to purchase it?!  Why AMAZON of course!
Purchasing from AMAZON always meets my expectations...product diversity and availability, very good pricing, courteous service, and prompt delivery.
What's not to love?",1361232000,4,481,4.771084337349397

5368816,1,B009UHGW7Y,"Once again, the movie makes an utter mockery of the book. Couldn't get past the first 10 minutes...the Dame would be mortified by such a butcher job....Read the book! It supersedes the movie by a million. Not even comparable, hardly the same story.",1489363200,,248,4.790697674418604

5368818,5,B009UHGW7Y,"I'm so glad I watched this without being familiar with the story first- that's how I suggest everyone see it! Great performances all around, I'll definitely be watching this one again.",1484784000,2,184,4.967741935483871
5368819,5,B009UHGW7Y,Great story even though it was a little slow going at first.  Well worth the wait.,1484697600,,82,4.125
5368820,5,B009UHGW7Y,I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it.  Watching it on screen was even better!,1484697600,,87,4.117647058823529
5368821,5,B009UHGW7Y,"This film stands as a text in its own right as well as an adaptation of du Maurier's novel. The film's sensibility is more modern compared to the bleakness and harshness of the novel where the burden of history weighs heavily on the family. Each of the characters is more sympathetic than in the novel, with the exception of Johnny (Jean in the novel) the industrialist. It is a tense and gripping drama, but ultimately more optimistic and bright than the novel. In some ways I preferred the film, because although it is thematically and psychologically less complex it seems richer in its deep humanity. Somehow the simplification and compression necessitated by the film medium has highlighted the story's strengths.

The film's plot deviates considerably from the novel, which enhances the 'thriller' genre characteristics and, truly, this does not detract from the story at all. if you have already read the novel you'll find the film's transformations thought-provoking. If not, you are in for a double treat with both film and novel. The Scapegoat is a superb adaptation that will delight new and old fans of du Maurier's work.",1482278400,,1133,4.994708994708994
5368822,5,B009UHGW7Y,"What a great movie! At first it was a little challenging to figure out who was who, so here goes. First, there is the Spence family. They are very well-to-do, live in a beautiful manor home, and are led by Johnny Spence, the young patriarch of the family. Living with Johnny is his mother Lady Spence (Eileen Atkins), his brother and business partner Paul and Paul's sex-pot wife Nina, Johnny's unmarried sister Blanche, his wife Frances, and his young daughter Mary Lou. THEN we have John Standing: a nice, single teacher who just happens to be a dead-ringer for Johnny (both parts played by Matthew Rhys). They just happen to meet ... and what follows is a creative plot with drama, love, tenderness, a touch of violence, mystery, a scary part, and did I say drama?!  I never read Daphne du Maurier's novel, so all of the plot was a surprise. Well done. Highly recommend.",1480377600,,873,4.632258064516129
5368823,5,B009UHGW7Y,"Great movie, although it ""borrows"" from The Prince and the Pauper a bit. The acting is great, Matthew Rhys is awesome! I wish it was available for purchase in the US.  I think I'll read the book now -",1479859200,2,200,4.128205128205129

5368825,5,B009UHGW7Y,"I have watched this movie many times and absolutely love, love, love it.  I watched the older version with bette davis and found it uninteresting and disappointing.",1479168000,,164,5.074074074074074
5368826,5,B009UHGW7Y,"Excellent film.  Great plot with many twists.  The sets, scenery and costumes worked well to depict the year 1952.  Acting was superb.  I'll say no more as to not spoil the story.",1478304000,,179,4.5
5368827,5,B009UHGW7Y,Great viewing from start to finish - superb acting and gripping story.,1477785600,,70,4.916666666666667
5368828,5,B009UHGW7Y,"Beautifully cast and set, and the story line is balanced, interesting, and surprising. I was so appreciative of finding a movie where people keep their clothes on, mortality is tastefully handled, and no bad language. I loved it!",1477180800,3,229,5.052631578947368
5368829,5,B009UHGW7Y,"If you are willing to suspend your disbelief, this is well worth watching. Every performance was excellent. Matthew Rhys was excellent as always.  I love Andrew Scott and he was adorable in this. The settings were outstanding and also brought 1952 to life. Enjoy!",1476748800,6,263,4.9772727272727275

5368832,3,B009UHGW7Y,"A bit weird, but then it's Daphne DuMaurier's book. Matthew Rhys (The Americans) is smashing as two people.
Acting is good, but the scenes of Wales are stunning!  The ending didn't seem to fit, but rather was re-worked so we could have a happy ending.",1473033600,,251,4.5777777777777775
5368833,5,B009UHGW7Y,I loved it!! Good story line. Characters did a good job of either liking or not liking them. Feel good movie with a great climax.,1472860800,,129,4.2

5368836,5,B009UHGW7Y,"An unexpected gem of a movie. While the storyline is predictable -  unwitting scapegoat becomes the hero - excellent acting by Rhys, as we see him thinking his way through each plot twist, kept it interesting.",1471478400,3,209,4.805555555555555

5368843,4,B009UHGW7Y,"I watched this on Netflix initially. If you do not have access to the service, please note that this review is for a Region 2 DVD, which won't play in players purchased in the US, as far as I know (but you may be able to go online and find a 'hack' that will enable you to modify your player.)

The only Du Maurier novel I have read is 'Rebecca', so I cannot comment on how well this version of this story follows the narrative. It is quite entertaining, though. While I was watching it, my 18 yr old son was drawn out of his online game by it, so that says something. It occurred to me as John settled more and more into 'being Johnny', ""this is kind of like the moral of 'It's a Wonderful Life' turned inside out."" Johnny and his brutish ways can disappear and everyone is happier, and the stars align! Then, it seemed to me that Johnny had set this horrific plan in place purposely. I realize that that is not the case, it couldn't be--but Johnny is seen clearly to be a completely morally bereft opportunist. I won't tell any more than that for those who are planning to watch. Really well written, brilliantly paced, great acting!",1424649600,,1135,4.303738317757009
5368844,4,B009UHGW7Y,"Adapted from Daphne Du Maurier's 1957 book of the same name this 2012 ITV production provides a pleasant enough way to spend a spare hour and a half. It tells the somewhat unlikely story of a man, John Standing (Matthew Rhys), recently made redundant from his job teaching in a boarding school, whose chance encounter with another man, Jonny Spence, alters his life forever. The reason is because the man happens to be his identical twin: they are not related but in every other respect could have come from the same egg. Rather in the way that chance encounters between doppelgangers have traditionally provided authors with convenient plot devices, obvious examples being Mark Twain's Prince and his Pauper twin and Anthony Hope's Rudolf of Ruritania and his English namesake, Rassendyll, this one has potentially similar far reaching consequences!

Spence comes from a wealthy background and lives in relative luxury in a `stately pile' deep in the country. The family owns a failing glass business on behalf of which he needs to secure a lucrative contract that may save it. When he meets Standing, he takes into his head to switch lives. Consequently, Standing ends up, after a night of drinking with his new `buddy', bereft of clothes and anything else that proves his true identity. He is astonished to be greeted by `his' valet/chauffeur, George, the morning after who sorts everything out with the understanding pub landlord whose hospitality Standing has `enjoyed' and whisked away to his new life in the country.

Here he finds he has a doting but slightly dopey wife, Frances (Alice Orr-Ewing), a delightfully precocious young daughter, Mary-Lou (Eloise Webb), a hypochondriac bed-ridden, junky mom, Lady Spence (Eileen Atkins), a sister, Blanche (Jodhi May), who, for reasons that gradually become apparent, hates him and a flighty sister-in-law, Nina (Sheridan Smith) with whom, apparently, he's been conducting an affair while his somewhat dim-witted `brother', Paul (Andrew Scott), has been struggling to deal with the company's problems, more or less alone.

All of which, of course, means he has to learn pretty fast and there are some pleasingly humorous moments when the hapless husband/lover/father/brother/son is addressed, insulted or admonished for the crimes and misdemeanours of his `twin'. The whole thing, if you can suspend your slightly credulous disbelief, while not being the most riveting drama nevertheless conjures up that post-war period in England around the time of Elizabeth's coronation that seems, today, like another world and provides a harmless and reasonably engaging entertainment with excellent performances from a first rate cast.",1420243200,,2678,5.326241134751773
5368854,5,B009UHGW7Y,"Charmed, simply charmed, by this adaptation of a Daphne DuMaurier novel.  It is 1952, and when a young English schoolteacher John Standing (Matthew Rhys) meets his aristocratic doppelganger, or lookalike, John Spence (Matthew Rhys again), in a pub one evening, the sly and scheming aristocrat gets him drunk, steals his clothes and identity.

When the aristocrat's chauffeur comes to pick John up at the hotel the next morning, our kindly and befuddled schoolteacher  discovers his clothes and wallet missing. John travels to the aristocrat's large English manor and assumes his identity.  Now the fun begins.  He soon discovers that his doppelganger is particularly loathsome and hated by some of his family members. John tries to repair many of the evils his doppelganger has instigated.

How he interacts with his new family, and how they react to him is one of the chief delights of this film.  And there are many delights.  Matthew Rhys plays the fast-talking entitled aristocrat to the hilt as well as the charming, unassuming but wise teacher.
Will his evil doppelganger return?  And what happens if he does?

Ms. DuMaurier would be pleased with this adaptation of her story as it has a lively mix of humor, mystery, and love story. It quite easily could be overplayed, but it is not. All of the actors seem suited for their roles from the discreet butler to the observant maid.  You start to care about the characters, and hope it ends well for all of them, except for the conniving John Spence.  Anglophiles and DuMaurier fans should enjoy this delightful film.",1418515200,,1570,4.950381679389313
5368855,4,B009UHGW7Y,"The prince and pauper genre has found a great new twist with ""The Scapegoat""! Matthew Rhys gives his usual stellar performance this time as a humble out-of-work boys' school teacher that is tricked into the new life of a mean greedy titan of British industry on the eve of QEII's coronation (yes he's great in these opposite roles). My wife and I really enjoyed the movie's drama, romance, humor, vintage Rolls Royce, and ending. No spoiler alert here though, take a look at this great flick for yourself!",1417305600,,505,4.75
5368856,3,B009UHGW7Y,"I watched this with little expectations...I'd never heard of Daphne Du Maurier but i've enjoyed seeing 'the americans'. First, the premise is far fetched and at spots (many) the lines and acting poor...but all that said I enjoyed it and will look up the original story.",1416873600,,269,4.869565217391305
5368857,5,B009UHGW7Y,"I first saw this movie on PBS and thought it was great.  I have since watched it on Netflix.  Matthew Rhys is excellent in his dual role.  I was very anxious to purchase it, but extremely disappointed to learn that only the non USA format is available. Can't imagine why there would be no  Region 1 version available.",1401408000,,317,4.413793103448276

his usual stellar performance. Unfortunately, I was unable to play it on
my DVD player. So sad!",1398556800,,165,4.533333333333333
5368859,5,B009UHGW7Y,"In the manner of classic British cinema, the suspense is a bit understated but palpable nonetheless and grows as the story progresses.  Eventually one becomes anxious to see just what's going to happen next and how the hero will try to extricate himself from the next challenge.  Only complaint is that a Region 1 (U.S. & Canada) version is not yet available.  Hope this is remedied soon so that others can enjoy the film.",1394668800,,422,4.675675675675675

5368861,5,B009UHGW7Y,"Love this story, the actors and setting.  I'm a sucker for twin mysteries.  Can't wait to purchase it.  Highly recommend.",1388448000,,121,4.95
5368862,5,B009UHGW7Y,"Matthew Rhys does an excellent job of playing a wealthy executive named John and a recently unemployed schoolteacher who happen to meet one night in a British pub and discover that they look almost alike. The executive, who lives in a British mansion with his wife, his married brother and his wife, his unmarried sister, and his drug-addicted mother and her caretaker, has recently failed to obtain a contract that will keep their foundry open. When he meets his doppelgnger, he gets him drunk, takes his clothes, and disappears. Meanwhile, the former schoolteacher is picked up by the chauffeur, who has no idea that he is not the owner of the foundry. Neither does anyone else in the family. They simply assume he is John. The new ""John"" discovers that he must negotiate some rather complex family dynamics, which have come about because the John who has disappeared has had affairs with his brother's wife and the former female lover of his sister. In effect, ""John"" the schoolteacher must take upon himself the sins that the original John has inflicted on his family.

This movie was far better than I first expected. Although it began rather slowly, it soon picked up and I found myself engrossed in the plot. While in some ways it is a bit farfetched (though not extremely so), it is also eminently believable.

For the American viewer I would suggest using subtitles. Some of the British English is a bit hard to understand, particularly at the start.",1385337600,6,1459,4.808764940239044
5368863,5,B009UHGW7Y,"I did not order dvd because I have problems with non-usa format.
however, like one other reviewer, I saw it on Netflix with English subtitles.

I am an avid movie watcher and this is one of the finest movies I have ever seen.  The acting of Matthew Rhys (in the two lead roles) and Phoebe Nicholls (in a small role) are excellent.
