445481,3,6302261295,"""Evil Toons"" is a peculiar movie about coeds in a haunted house from the notorious Fred Olen Ray. The premise is simple: four coeds arrive to spend the weekend cleaning an old house; an evil spirit haunts them resulting in mayhem, bloodshed, and other typical debauchery. The acting is absolutely terrible even for this genre: the best of the girls is Monique Gabrielle who, believe it or not, plays the nerdy and reserved Megan.

The real gimmick here is the animated monster who is nefarious indeed. He's onscreen for precious little time due to budgetary concerns, but I have to admit, after listening to Ray describe the laborious process they went through to get the composite footage, it looks pretty good and is definitely an interesting change for movies of this ilk. Today the animation would be done with CGI of course, but when this was made that was in the future, and each cel was hand-painted in New York around the master shot. The stars of the film are David Carradine and Arte Johnson, who turn in perfectly adequate performances even though they are not onscreen very much. I was actually most creeped out by the footage of David Carradine tightening a noose around his own neck in light of his tragic death. I did like the talking book effect, and thought it was cleverly employed in the storyline.

While the movie is very predictable with little to recommend it other than the animation novelty, the DVD is great, and there are loads of extras. I always appreciate the Retromedia releases, and this time they gave us a director's commentary track, the original trailer, part of the editor's original work print of the movie, a brief ""making of"" feature, and the original ""Nite Owl Theater"" host segment starring Ray. By far the best of the extras is Fred Olen Ray's commentary: it is genuinely interesting and very enlightening about low budget filmmaking (I especially enjoyed the recounting of the film's origins with the weird but economical ""Millennium Countdown"" tie-in.) Ray isn't afraid of exposing flaws in his own films (note the long discussion of doorknob and door hinge mismatch issues,) and is quick to explain interesting technical points without getting bogged down in minutiae. The animation process details he gives are especially noteworthy. The ""making of"" feature is a bit of a letdown if you have already listened to the commentary as much of it is a rehash, although I did enjoy the segment of film dubbed into French. The trailer is a camp classic, but that makes sense because so  is the movie. The original editor's work print is very interesting to compare to the finished product, although I would have liked to see this cut of the entire film instead of the brief section that the DVD shows.

""Evil Toons"" was a very ambitious film, especially on a $140,000 budget. If you are a connoisseur of the ""coeds in peril"" genre, this is a unique film you won't want to miss.",1284422400,11,2916,4.779761904761905
445482,4,6302261295,"This may be a B-movie, but I give it an A all the way! True, it's just an excuse to show T&A, but it's laced with humor all the way through! Anyone who takes this movie seriously or makes fun of the storyline or effects needs to have their head examined! Anyone can tell it's a low budget movie made to get cheap laughs. In the scene when Roxanne is stripping and she throws her shirt, the sound of breaking glass after the shirt flies offscreen kills me! Add to that the ""jiggle"" noise when she turns around and shakes her but and you HAVE to laugh! The monster (a Tazmanian Devil look-a-like) is just as funny with his reactions to Roxanne!

If you're a fan of low budget horror mixed with off beat comedy and have never seen this movie, you need to beg, borrow or steal a copy so you can sit down for some laughs! Better yet, just buy a copy off Amazon.com while you're here!",1127260800,2,878,4.195266272189349
445483,5,6302261295,"Just like the other reviewers, I've got to say the first time I saw this bit of ""B"" movie perfection was late night on The Movie Channel. Even at that time this movie was hacked to pieces by the channel that was airing it! However there are so many reasons why anyone who loves cult horror films must own this!

 Here's your plot, and the basis for my love of the film. Take four young beautiful coeds who are in charge of cleaning a large mansion (that strangely looks identical to the one in sorrority house massacre II and slumber party massacre) and have them find an old book of spells. One of the spells just happens to release a demon into the house, but instead of a disgusting slimy rubber demon we get a cute and crude cartoon demon superimposed on the screen! Talk about the X-rated version of Roger Rabbit! From then there's nothing but stripped girls, bloody deaths, and crude language from a raunchy cartoon demon! Couple this with David Carrodine running around outside and you've got a 90 minute piece of cult horror history.

 And the best part to finish off has to be the cast. You will see Kung-Fu and the recent Kill Bill's David Carrodine, known for his late 80's and early 90's ""B"" film roles as either a pimp, a strip club owner, or some wierdo who hangs out with hot chicks (and this is the role he plays in this movie). The next would be the four girls in this adventure: Monique Gabriel, Suzanne Ager, Madison Stone, and Barbara Dare. If you don't know their names you may know their faces...provided you indulged in adult cinema in the 90's. They're all porno stars! This film does go out of its way to prove this fact as well.

 This movie was IMPOSSIBLE to find at video stores and I'm almost sure never hit store shelves on VHS, but it is now availible (and only here, I think) in all its digital glory (and with special features) and I can't find a single reason why any fan of cult horror wouldn't want to own this and share with all of their buddies over a case of beer!",1091232000,22,2003,4.35656836461126
445484,4,6302261295,"I had first accidentally stumbled upon this movie several years ago late one night on cable t.v. Within an instint, I fell in love with the atrocious acting, worse dialog, and sleazy nudity. EVIL TOONS is truly, as far as I'm concerned, a modern classic in cult/trash cinema. Thus, it seemed only appropriate to own this title on DVD.
The disc contains a nice looking widescreen picture, however, the sound is mono. The DVD has some interesting bonuses such as a trailer, a 10 minute ""behind-the-scenes"" commentary with the film's director, Fred Olen Ray, and a funny intro to the movie with the director, his wife, and naked women chained to the wall.

It has no substance, no humor, the cartoon monster looks like the early renditions of Mickey Mouse (1930's)...and the sound is pitiful.  The only reason I gave it one star was for the brief sequence when Monique Gabrielle undresses in front of her bedroom mirror.  Granted, many of these types of films are known for casting buxom young girls, but Monique is beautiful.  What disturbed me most was that every young girl in the film is depicted as being a total airhead.  The blood and gore effects you can buy at K-Mart this Halloween...and the makeup artist is clearly not an ""artist"".  Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I expected much more.

445488,4,6302261295,"Evil Toons is an entertaining b line movie by Fred Olen Ray.  The plot involves four girls hired to clean an old house for its new owners.  What the girls don't realize is that the house has a long history of strange and evil happenings.  Their first night there a stranger delivers a package to them.  They open it to find a strange book with explicit drawings and strange warnings in it.  The girls end up releasing an animated beast that has a propensity to kill and tear the cloths off its victims. The movie is both funny and a little bit scarey, but it is definitely entertaining.
I would recomend this movie to those of you that enjoy b line movies.  Evil Toons is very entertaining and it is proof that you don't need a huge budget to make and entertaining movie.  Just be advised that you are getting a b line movie, so the acting is not always the best and the effects don't rival Terminator.  You have to appreciate this movie for what it is.

445554,4,6302261295,"I have a very strong sense of nostalgia for this film, released in the early '90s and played frequently on The Movie Channel back in that day.  The plot is kind of a standard comedy-horror deal and doesn't make just a whole lot of sense, but what does make sense is the fair amount of nudity including a frequent star turn by Madison Stone's butt. Seeing that butt at the age of 16 had a profound affect on the rest of my life.

David Carradine and Arte Johnson star as weird shadowy figures who hang around as four hot sorority chicks spend a weekend cleaning an old house for $100 each. Monique Gabrielle doesn't disrobe nearly enough (only once) and that's disappointing; all of the other female cast members get naked more than once (Stone runs around topless pretty much through three quarters of the movie) except for  Michelle Bauer who has only a cameo role and still gets topless once.

The acting and dialogue are atrocious, nearly unwatchable at points, so thank God for those nude scenes. The animated portions are done surprisingly well for such a low-rent movie.

What really gives this four stars is the anniversary DVD extras, which include a wonderful director's commentary, a very short making-of feature and a few other goodies. Highly recommended for those who can appreciate the trashy cinema of this era.",1416096000,4,1326,4.747826086956522
445555,3,6302261295,"First of all yes, it's a bad movie, bad acting, bad special effect, etc. The only reason why I bought this film was because I thought most of the movie would show the cartoon demon...it did not. The demon only appeared as his cartoon self for about a minute or two. However, throughout the rest of the film he runs around disguised as his first female victim. He (now a she) runs around killing others with breasts popping out of her open shirt...what????? I was disappointed. If the movie would have contained more shots of the cartoon demon I would have given this film six stars...despite how bad it was.
Some reviewers complained how the director didn't know where to take this movie/ what to do with it. Personally, I think he knew exactly what he wanted to do with it. However, the film wasn't done well enough for the audience to fully get the director's vision. My bases for the above statement can be found throughout this film. For example, if you listen to the jokes, they sometimes revolve around predicting what could happen in such clich scenarios.  Personally, I feel that the director was intentionally making fun of monster movies/ acting in monster movies, etc. For example the girls (while in the basement at beginning of film) would joke about ""now this is when we find the Ouija board.""
The director also tried throwing in other types of jokes. For example, in one scene, the girls are screaming, and the nerdy girl's pony tail proceeded to stick straight up into the air.
 One of the major problems with this film is that you can't fully tell when/ if the director was trying to create intense/dramatic, if any, scenes. This leads to confusion for the audience on how to view this film. Another indicator that the director was intentionally trying to poke fun at this movie genre was the awful dialogue. Some of what the girls had said was VERY 1950's, and it was laughable. Some of the lines included, ""what are you, a afraidy cat,"" ""gee,"" and my favorite was, ""rats!"" Once I heard ""rats"" I started laughing...what was this...Charlie Brown (some of the movie was like this/not all dialogue was like a 50's film)? Another example of bizzare humor was when the cartoon demon first appeared, and he saw the slutty girl bending over. He tugged on his ears, and made a licking motion with his tongue (almost like a loony toons moment of a character being in love).
Also, yes, there are a lot of boobs popping out in this film, but no sex. However, there was one scene where the demon held down his victim, he said ""nice tits."" He then proceeded to mount her, but you never see him enter her...some people claim this is a rape scene, and yes I could see it being one. However, you never see the demon enter her/ do much to her. the camera suddenly cuts to a close up of the girl's face/ her screaming.
Honestly, I fast forwarded a lot of the movie, I was looking for more of the cartoon demon, and couldn't find him (let's face it, that's  the only reason most of us want to buy this movie). Personally, I thought the cartoon demon was cute...he was almost like a mix of the tazmanian devil (loony tunes), a wolf, and a monster. Not scary at all. Some of his dialogue was even funny. such as, ""I'll get you in the sequel.""
I liked the movie on the level that it was so bad, and it was almost interesting....if they would have added more of the cartoon demon throughout the movie, I would watch this several more times. But having a possessed girl, with her tits hanging out (substitute for seeing the cartoon demon) did not make this movie work.....I doubt I will watch this film again.
Also, some other things that were strange about the film:
(1) The slutty girl's boyfriend did not look like a young jock...he looked like he was in his late 20's...did not fit the part at all.
(2) Why was the tapestry from hell (throwing it over the body-sending souls to hell) necessary?
(3) Why did the old dude have a hot model for a wife???????? She wanted s-x with him, and he said no, I have to check on the girls and the house???? what?????
(4) when the demon first appears (cartoon) he ducks behind a couch (girl was coming into room-he was trying to hide). However, the back of the couch was facing the girl (as she entered the room), so if the demon was behind the couch-facing girl, how could she miss him??????
(5) SPOILER ALERT  The movie's ending is confusing...they're dead, no they're not, yes they are, no they're not?????????????

This might be a fine movie for people who want to try to watch horror movies, but they have never seen one before/ not sure if they can handle the horror genre...If  so then this movie is right for you. Yes it's a bad movie all the way through, but it's also not scary, yet at the same time it gives you a taste of typical horror genre(especially monster movies such as people in unknown locations, nudity, reading from a magical book which summons evil creatures, and so on.). This movie is also for those who love horrible horror movies. I would have loved it....but I WANTED MORE OF THE CARTOON DEMON. The demon was so bizzare (because it was a cartoon) that I feel more of him would have saved this film (for what the movie was).",1405468800,5,5186,4.4883474576271185

445570,1,6302261295,"Ok, I get it, I get it... this is how this movie came about. A group of no talent perverts got together to write a horror story. There script was of a group of girls who are hired to stay the weekend and clean an old abandoned house that has a boogedy boogada history. A mysterious man delivers them a book in the middle of the night, and what the heck, they open it. Of coarse, the nerd of the group can read ancient Latin and unleashes a demon in the house and the eye of the tiger kicks in with one girls will to survive.

However, once principal photography was complete, studio executives took a look at the daily's of the film and said, ""You know what, this movie is horrible. We are not giving you a cent to use special effects or create puppets to make the demon that's to be cut into the film, even with decent effects, the movie will still be &*^%$ house""

So, instead, the director and producer and writers decided to ask someone to draw in a cartoon demon, and only one, but where so thrilled at what they thought was going to be the most brilliant idea in movie history, they didn't proof read the title and called the movie Evil Toons, instead of Evil Toon, as only one appears in the movie. Sorry, that is a bit of a spoiler, but trust me, you won't be disappointed to find that out if you ever have the misfortune of having to watch this thing in its entirety.

Being that they made such a bad movie, with horrible acting and a stupid enough plot, they figured they might try to pass off what they have, now with a cartoon bad guy, as a comedy! However, not much at all is funny other than how bad the overall outcome is. About the only thing I thought was funny and a good line was ""You, B&%$#. I'll get you back in the sequel""... classic... too bad the rest of the movie prevents it from actually being one.

David ""Kung-Fu Dude"" Carradine is probably the only reason anyone would still purposely track down this movie... that or you see it recommended in ""Parody"" movies, like I did, but this is not a parody movie of anything but itself. David Carradine must be turning in his grave when people watch this film. Surely he didn't need the money that badly at the time it was made did he? Oh well, rest now, Grasshoppa.

I also suspect that after the cartoon thing was inserted, executives still said, ""Nah, it's still not worthy of releasing... unless of coarse you throw in some gratuitous nudity"". Now, I slammed a movie called ""The Slaughter-house Massacre (AKA: Sickle)"" once where for no reason what-so-ever there is a 15 minute scene of two lesbians making out at a rave party that has no relevance to the film what-so-ever. I think I have found a contender for that now in this movie. For no reason at all one of the girls turns on a radio and starts strip dancing, and telling the shy girl to join in, whom she offends and the shy girl runs upstairs upset. She goes into her room, takes off her cloths in front of the mirror, poses for herself while feeling her own melons, gets dressed again in time for another girl to come up stairs and ask her to come back down stairs. WTF? Why was this needed in the movie? Oh wait, I already answered that, the executives must have wanted something in it to try and attract teenage boys money, because selling it as a horror or comedy wasn't going to work by itself. If that scene wasn't stupid enough, it seems every girl in this movie has to be exposing themselves and being felt up by a cartoon dog before dying.

445571,5,6302261295,"This has stood the test of a cult classic. This obscure horror film DVD quickly reached the $40.00 mark. They made a re-issue of it, and it too sailed up to that level. In that regard, this film rates up there with the original ""Night of the Demons.""

What separated this film from the pack was the cartoon ""Taz"" like demon with a sense of humor. He was smartly integrated into the film with an attack rape scene with porn star Madison Stone. This was the scene that made the film a cult classic as the demon's tongue licked her chest and caused her bra to come apart. I will take that scene to my perverted grave.

The cast includes David Carradine, Arte Johnson, and scream queen Michelle Bauer, in case 4 topless co-eds aren't enough for you. The other porn star in this film, Barbara Dare, plays a shy geeky girl. Monique Gabrielle was the Dec. 1982 ""Pet of the Month."" What was most amazing was the better than normal caliber acting from the porn stars. Plot summary: Girls clean house. Girls get ancient book. Girls accidentally summon a demon.

Now if you don't have the money to shell out to buy this film, do a Google search and you might find it free to watch on line. For me this is a must for any horror cult collection.",1359072000,3,1232,4.3478260869565215

445573,4,6302261295,"I quite enjoyed this film.  It wasn't boring by any stretch of the imagination, and its certainly not going to win any awards for its acting.  It is what it is, a B-movie cheesefest, but its entertaining nonetheless.

In some respects, this film could be seen almost as a satire or parody of the original 'Evil Dead' film.  a bunch of friends get together for the weekend, they come across a creepy book full of mystic incantations, one of them recites the incantations and unleashes a demonic force that picks them off one by one.

The girls involved are all super hot, three of them I'm sure are probably porn stars, but the real standout is Monique Gabrielle.  She's not only super hot, but she's a really talented actress.  I love how she underplays her sexuality in this film, by wearing her hair in a ponytail, covering up and putting on glasses that essentially classify her as a bookworm and a bit of a shy nerd, but a very cute nerd who is just a little shy and insecure about herself and her body, and wishes she had the sort of courage her friends have to be more confident about themselves and their bodies.

The late David Carradine is also featured in this film, and he does well as a mysterious stranger who skulks and lurks around the house, waiting for the right moment to strike against the evil demon.  What is kinda unnerving is the fact that the movie starts out with Carradine's character hanging himself.

Arte Johnson (of Laugh-In fame) pops up occasionally as a seemingly well-meaning, but somewhat lecherous next door neighbor, but provides some good moments of humor.

A lot of the dialogue in this film is without a doubt hilarious, because at some moments, it makes the characters almost self aware, like the fact they are know they are in a cheesy horror film.  And this film was done in the early 90's, long before Wes Craven would capitalize on that idea and instill his characters with that self-awareness in the successful 'Scream' franchise.

The Evil Toon in question is done very well, and although his screen time is limited, its understandable given that this is a low budget film.

Its the sort of film you should watch with your friends, a bunch of friends, with plenty of popcorn and booze.",1318550400,,2232,4.603535353535354
445574,2,6302261295,"Bad acting, dumb plot, Naked chicks and a demonic cartoon monster that is released from what looks like the book of the dead and possess one of the girls, than goes on a killing spree to free other toons from the book. somewhat entertaining to watch, is it so bad its good? well, there we're parts I laughed at, mostly the bad acting but all in all its really lame stuff.",1314144000,,371,4.23943661971831
445575,2,6302261295,"Evil Toons.  This movie mixes animation with actual people.  Neither side of the equation does that mixture very well.  The movie probably was meant to be funny, but it isn't all that funny.  Maybe it was meant to be scary, but it's not all that fulfilling for horror or thriller.  Maybe it was meant to show off the assets of a few women in a 1970's R-rated type movie.  Problem is this movie came out in 1992, therefore that doesn't work either.  David Carridine must have owed somebody a favor, and I felt sorry for Arte Johnson for having appeared in such a flop.  I'm guessing somebody knew a producer willing to showcase Monique Gabrielle and a few other exotic dancers.  Problem is, only one seems willing to be just partially showcased.  The remainder of the cast disappoint any viewer of any age between 14 and 80 years of age, and the movie ends up seeming to be marketed to the preteen boys who manage to somehow get to see this movie.  Even then, so much is left at the suggestive inuendo stage, I can't imagine even that audience getting much satisfaction.  Unless you're usually drunk or high, I can't picture this movie being worth buying.  I didn't mind seeing it once I guess, but this is one of those really, really bad 'B' movies that you keep in a drawer, not on the shelf.  I would have had to give this a 1-star rating if there wasn't at least SOME skin in it to justify an ""R"" rating.  But this movie just doesn't cut the mustard no matter what sandwich you're trying to make with it.  Meh.",1290470400,3,1513,4.388489208633094
