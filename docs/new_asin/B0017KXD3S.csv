8266297,2,B0017KXD3S,"Ten Roger Corman cheapies for $5.

That's what I paid and comes out to .50 per flick, so I can't say I didn't get my money's worth. I would venture that anyone getting this DVD set knows full well what they're in for. Corman was the ""King of the B's"". He prided himself on how far he could stretch a shoestring budget and most of his films, despite being terrible, did turn a profit, as they were so cheap to produce.

The ten films on this collection are wildly uneven. Some (""The Wasp Woman"", ""The Last Woman on Earth"") were better than I expected. Others (""Little Shop of Horrors"") were worse. Most were pretty much exactly what I imagined they would be -- rubber monsters, bad acting, and yet strangely entertaining.

This collection gets two stars however for its abysmal quality. Just because Corman produced these films on the cheap doesn't mean I want the transfer to DVD to be cheap. The sound quality on everything (except ""The Wasp Woman"" for some reason) is awful. It's tinny and at times incomprehensible. The picture quality on about half of these is also a mess -- it's grainy, with terrible contrast, and at times, gaps from the original film are missing. This is inexcusable. Other than the box, there is no packaging at all -- no notes on the film, cast or anything. This collection of 10 films comes with 5 DVD's -- with one movie on on each side. You can say that they're not being wasteful with product, but it ends up looking as cheap as, well, as the monster from ""Creature from the Haunted Sea"". (The latter at least was comical.)

The only extra is a series of movie trailers that appear on the same disc that ""Little Shop of Horrors"" appears on. Now when I first popped it in and saw the option to ""play trailers"" I was surprised and excited. Were these going to be the actual trailers for the ten Corman films in this collection? What a great surprise! -- Imagine my disappointment when the trailers were for films that have NOTHING to do with this set or Roger Corman! I still have no idea why they're here. There are trailers for ""War of the Worlds"", ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"", and a variety of other Sci-Fi and Monster Drive-in flicks from the 1950's and early 1960's. What they're doing on this collection is anyone's guess.

Overall, if you can get this for $5 like I did, you can't go wrong. Be prepared for the lousy sound and video transfer and just expect that you're getting quantity, not quality.

-- As an aside, Susan Cabot (who played the Wasp Woman) was one stunningly gorgeous gal!",1245801600,5,2531,4.503267973856209
