6508439,5,B00LW8APN6,I reviewed Season Two and I've backed up to Season 1 because I just love these characters and their zest for life.  Their emotional intrigues and ups and downs are just delightful.,1412726400,9,180,4.625

60's.",1411603200,5,110,4.7894736842105265
6508442,3,B00LW8APN6,"Nowhere near the quality of Montalbano but enjoyable if you like Italian.  More sitcom than mystery, although the mystery is always there.",1411430400,13,138,5.2727272727272725
6508443,2,B00LW8APN6,"Its too cartoonish. More comedy than detective show. The characters are too stereotyped, and the acting is not very good.",1409788800,12,121,5.1

6508453,1,B00LW8APN6,"There's nothing really wrong with this series.  I just didn't like it.  I bought one episode to check it out and decided not to buy more.  It's a comedy, which I missed in the description.  And while I sometimes like mysteries with an element of humor, this one was just too much.  The Montalbano mysteries have this light-hearted aspect to them but it's not overwhelming.",1443139200,2,372,4.661538461538462

6508456,4,B00LW8APN6,"The episodes are fun, the characters are interesting and the bantering between the two main characters
add to the entertainment.  If you are looking for a nice diversion from blood and gore, I suggest purchasing the series.",1435449600,2,223,5.027027027027027
6508457,5,B00LW8APN6,"What a FUN show. Not based on cgi or car chases. Plenty of light comedy that is well acted. You get to just laugh and enjoy this comedic police series. And eye candy for both men and women. Francesco Quinn is in this but is overshadowed by Guido Caprino. a really nice Ha Ha Ha. The cast works so well together. Too bad it only has two seasons. And for all those indignant ratings I bet they gave 5 stars to shows like ""friends"" and ""sex in the city"" and this series is so much better. You get to see Italy in sights, sounds and comedic flavor.",1432857600,3,544,4.093457943925234

6508459,1,B00LW8APN6,"This was one of the most stupid, sexist bit of nonsense that I have seen.  What a shame.  A waste of time and money.",1424044800,,116,3.7916666666666665
6508460,5,B00LW8APN6,"I borrowed season 2 fr the library first because they didn't have this one. I gave season 2 a 4 star, but I'm giving this one 5. I was looking for the quality of detective montalbano, in season two, but this is just campy fun. Manara is too sexy for the country town, all the women fall a over him, and he never follows orders. If u are looking for the quality/tight story lines of brunetti or montalbano, this is not it, If u are in the mood for light, campy fun, with moderate story lines, then u will enjoy this. Sadly, there is no season 3",1421452800,6,543,4.08411214953271
6508461,3,B00LW8APN6,This was purchased from Amazon . This show has English sub titles but this is not a problem. The story line was not good. Maybe it is me but the actors and the plot did not make a lot of sense.,1418515200,3,193,3.731707317073171
8668454,4,B00LW8APN6,"MANARA is an all-out romp. Doesn't take itself seriously. Not a sitcom, but definitely not a Montalbano or Wallander. I watch an episode or two when I want to forget my troubles. Charming lead actors, colorful Italian characters, fun stories. If you're looking for Nordic Noir or grisly storylines, this isn't for you. But if you want to spend a little time in an Italian town by the sea, this is the ticket.",1508889600,3,408,4.602739726027397
8668455,4,B00LW8APN6,"I warmed to this as the series progressed, so I'll re-watch it.
Nice bunch of characters, crimes are not too hideous (so many of the UK detectives stories are gagging), and lovely to look at.
I'm looking forward to buying further series.
He's not Montalbano, but who is?",1500508800,2,270,4.645833333333333

8668457,4,B00LW8APN6,This show was recommended to me. It is light hearted and actually quite charming. It reminds me a bit of the nostalgic charm of Psych. I also enjoy working on my Italian.,1473120000,,170,4.34375

i love that it is italian",1466035200,,42,4.375
8668462,5,B00LW8APN6,"Very underrated Italian crime series.  Appreciated as much for the light drama as for the comedy.  Guido Caprino does a superlative job as Il commissario Manara an excellent detective sent to a small town because of his unpopular way of getting the job done.  He is not popular with his superiors, but is popular with women and the staff at his new assignment.  A lot of sexy beautiful females in this series and all of them, young or old fall in love with this guy.  Guido carries it off beautifully . . . great voice as well.  I loved this series for the light touch, the Italian settings and the different culture.  Tired of the heavy handed over acted/written U.S. stuff.  Nice to have a change, even if it is in Italian.  Subtitles were a bit poor, but the acting more than made up for them.",1464048000,,796,4.397260273972603
