2664173,5,B000IY02W4,"A Great look and extra insight into the wonderful characters that Big and Little Edie Beale were.  They are presented in a much less exaggerated way from the original documentary ""Grey Gardens"".  A very down to earth look into these two very eccentric and remarkable women. You've got to love them. This would be a great addition to your Beale Library.",1169078400,39,352,4.754098360655738

2664175,5,B000IY02W4,"Another wonderful DVD about our favourite cult ladies.  The picture quality is superb.  Criterion is expensive but once you see the highest standards of transfer,  you realize it is money well spent.

 The content is as usual most interesting.  Just wait until you see the 'fashionista' parade of outfits.  Most important of course is another opportunity to view  the lives of these eccentric fascinating women Just staggering. It leaves you wanting more, more ........  Hope the Broadway musical will be filmed for distribution on DVD.",1168473600,22,536,5.211764705882353
2664176,5,B000IY02W4,"Either no one's got their copy yet---or eveyone's too afraid to write a review--so I will!  This is an EXCELLENT follow-up to Grey Gardens! There is no reason at all to think ""nothing can match the first one"" because THIS CAN! There are hundreds of great new ""lines"" in this, and all kinds of ""revolutionary costumes"" we have never seen before. You may wonder what differs in this film, as opposed to the first 'Grey Gardens.'  In truth, they are extremely similar--and in that Grey Gardens was wonderful, then that's a good thing! But seriously--the Beales are captured here making many more astute observations than in the first film. ""Little"" Edie talks at length about the differences between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party--and she received a standing ovation for this, when I saw the film in New York last August!  She also addresses the absurd notion that she was once labled ""schizophrenic.""  She says that ""NO one with convictions is ever schizophrenic---I just have a terrible temper---it's Southern.""

  There is lots of singing and a lot of joy in this film. There are different shots of the house, as well, and LOTS of Jerry ""The Marble Fawn."" The reason for this, is that Al maysles and his crew felt it was interesting to show Jerry's and Little Edie's rivalry and how the mother got quite a kick out of that. In truth, Mrs. Beale had quite a history of pitting her ""friends"" against Edie, for the sole sake of sitting back and watching the fireworks fly! There are SCREAMINGLY funny passive/aggressive ""observations"" on Edie's part about Jerry all through this film. ""See...the cats smelled Jerry. If he'd stay away for a month or two--I'm SURE we'd get at least two back.""

  I feel I must address reviewer ""D Kascchaks"" fixation with the Beale's dirty house. It is near impossible for two ladies (one being in bed and close to 80 at the time) to keep a 28 room mansion clean. They lived on little money, so help was more or less out of the question, as most of those years Jackie Kennedy Onasis was busy with million dollar shopping sprees and had more or less left her childhood relatives behind. And unfortunately, after Mr. Beale ""stopped living in East Hampton""  Mrs. Beale quickly spent all of the money left to her on parties and a good time. In truth---I don't blame her and hope she had fun! I commend the Maysles for not spending too much footage on the home's condition and instead, dedicated more time to these fascinating ladies.  I too---knew Edie Beale, but much later in life. She lived in a very nice, clean apartment in Bal Harbour Florida, with not ONE cat! She was in her 80's at the time, and although I was in my 20's, she had a crush on me! She was a dear to the end, not at all embittered by time or disappointment. It was very important to me to let her know that she HAD accomplished something in life, something more important than any profession or career: And that is being a TRUE original and bringing joy to millions of outcasts and free-thinkers(not to mention fashion officianados!) all over the world. She'd say, ""OH, Damon Sweetheart! Whenever I start to feel bad about myself you let me know I am A-OK."" A greater reward, I could not have recieved. A week before she passed away, she was excited about a new Edie Beale fan club someone mentioned to me.

  I have babbled on! Anyway, this is an excellent film, every bit as good as the original! You will love it, I promise you!

  (There are not really any extras on this, but who needs them--as there is so much here!  Al Maysles gives an introduction to the film, and introduces us to Jerry (the Marble Fawn) TODAY! The color and clarity are EXCELLENT, by the way.)",1166572800,290,3685,4.581430745814307
2664177,3,B000IY02W4,"If you can believe it, the Maysales' films capture a rather sanitized view of Grey Gardens.  I witnessed first hand the Beales from an intimate relationship as a young boy from age 8-13, when I lived across the street from them.  Grey Gardens was between my family's house and the beach, and it was on my bike that I met Miss Beale by calling to the spooky lady with cats crawling on her back from the street.  After getting to know her from the street, then porch, spending hours with her, I finally met Mrs. Beale a year later when she descended from her bedroom, which was a rare occasion.  But Mrs. Beale favored me even more than Miss, because I could sing and she loved to teach me ""I can't give you anything but love baby"" and sing to her niece Lee Radziwell over the phone from her bedroom.  Just know that the house is CLEAN compared to when I knew it.  This was pre-condemnation by the board of health, and raid because of the squaler that I knew.  There was an empty cat can mountain in the dining room, an inch thick coat of cat fesces on the stairs, and so much more repulsive conditions, it would seem better to live in a tent in the yard.  These films show a romantic side to the Beale's life, which has developed quite a cult following as a result.  For me, it's a time capsule that is not quite right, since I knew the Beales prior to, and more intimately when they didn't play to the cameras.",1164499200,238,1410,4.250936329588015
2664178,5,B000IY02W4,"Taken from the Criterion Collection desription:

The 1976 cinema vrit classic Grey Gardens, which captured in remarkable close-up the lives of the eccentric East Hampton recluses Big and Little Edie Beale, has spawned everything from a midnight-movie cult following to a Broadway musical, to an upcoming Hollywood adaptation. The filmmakers then went back to their vaults of footage to create part two, The Beales of Grey Gardens, a tribute both to these indomitable women and to the original landmark documentary's legions of fans, who have made them American counterculture icons.

This special DVD includes:

.New digital transfer, approved by director Albert Maysles

.New video introduction by Maysles

.Optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing

.Plus: A new essay by cultural critic Michael Musto",1161993600,30,821,5.476190476190476
2664179,1,B000IY02W4,"This ""documentary""  is  the same kind of personal attack  that was done to defame and belittle Marie Antoinette in the run-up to the French Revolution of 1789.  The documentary is aimed at mocking America's uncrowned Queen, Jackie Kennedy.  During JFK's presidency Jackie Kennedy was adored by the public; she could do no wrong.  Jackie's popularity infuriated  the Criminal Deep State...and even frightened them -- a word from Jackie identifying who killed JFK would have caused the public to take to the streets..

The Financial Elite/Deep State was at war with the Kennedy Family --  a war that did not stop with the murder of JFK but continued against  other members of the family.  The Deep State murdered JFK's brother Robert, made two attempts on the life of Teddy, and killed John Kennedy Jr.  Ted Kennedy and Jackie negotiated a truce with the killers.  Eventually Teddy died of a  brain tumor...like many politicians who know too much..William Casey.....Joe Biden Jr, John McCain, and Jackie died of leukemia.. . . conveeeniently out of the way, when John Jr announced his intention to run for president.
(Are brain tumors and cancers induced by microwaves? See: stopeg.com).

Although Jackie Kennedy was not physically murdered (until she was 63), her reputation was systematically smeared.  Papparazzi were allowed to take pictures of her sunbathing in the nude.  This documentary also is a form of indirect character assassination. The film-makers attack Jackie by mocking her physical double -- her cousin Edie.

Edie the Younger looked like an older version of Jackie. Little Edie had the same wide-spaced eyes, the same shape face, the same diction, but she was a cartoon version of Jackie,  the complete opposite of the sophisticated, glamorous First Lady.

The film-maker KNOWS what he is doing.  His film is a deliberate burlesque  of  Jackie Kennedy's  image.  Jackie was known for her taste in dress; so  the film-maker shows Edie half-naked, draping herself in scarves.  Jackie was known for her taste in decor, so little Edie is shown living in squalor.  Jackie was known to the public  for giving a tour of the White House on TV.  When Edie  leads  the camera man  to her beach, he blatantly draws a parallel with Jackie by saying to little Edie, ""You're giving me a tour like Jackie did of the White House.""

The movie-makers  were motivated by anti-Kennedy political hatred, but judging from the loving comments that the personality of f little  Edie evokes from viewers, the film-makers achieved  unintended results.  Edie's vulnerability, honesty and sweetness defeated the pettiness of the  film-makers'  mocking  intent.  Their film became a tribute to Edie....and a tribute cannot be equated with a mockery of Jackie Kennedy.

As Goethe said, ""Mephistopheles is part of that power  which  eternally wills evil and eternally works good.""",1502064000,,2867,5.1103896103896105

Compared to the original footage used for the documentary as shown on TV regarding Jackie Kennedy Onassis's relatives, this isn't it.  This ""follow-up"" DVD of the extra footage fell way short in comparison.  On the other hand, if you want a more complete library of available footage of these women and their story, then this follow-up DVD might be worth your purchase, but only after you've purchased the orignal documentary DVD.

I also LOVED the scene on the beach with LE and how she profoundly explains nature and man. Very haunting. And my personal favorite is at the end, when LE was interviewing through a window screen. She speaks of conformity in the Hamptons, how each house and yard must be the same. And tells how the East Hampton authorities remove flowers that are blooming too close to the road. Such a metaphor to the Beales ladies. Mr. Maysles suggests the title of the original documentary- Grey Gardens. And Little Edie ponders the idea, runs it by Big Edie and says she ""likes it.

2664243,5,B000IY02W4,"This is a more sane documentary than the original- Perhaps in the original the Maysle brothers were afraid that the documentary wouldn't work unless they showed the most wacky and histrionic aspects of the lives of the Big Edie and Little Edie. This documentary is much more gentle on the subjects. Miss Edie presents herself as a witty insightful woman at times inspite of animal hoarding and obvious self neglect...Her view of what she wants out of life, or at least men, explains a lot about her:
""American men are not a bit romantic. I like foreigners... What's romantic about an American stockbroker who you played tennis with at the age of 12 at the Maidstone tennis club? What's romantic about that? I mean, I don't want to hear about his Yale days and everything..."" Her statement about the Democrats and Republicans, ""The forces of good verses the forces of evil""  profound and to the point. ""Which is the party that produced our first criminal president?""
And Edie looks beautiful in a kind of gracious way, with her carriage, the turn of the head, the hand to her face. She missed her calling as a fashion designer for sure, and she brings a certain unselfconsciousness to her wardrobe creations...The real star is definitely Miss Edie, but the apple did not fall far from the tree in the person of her mother, Big Edie.  But clearly, something went terribly wrong somewhere in all of this...We look for blame and become angry that they were denied real help at some critical juncture in their life together. How did they become immune to the basic need for cleanliness and adequate shelter? When did they both become parties to animal hoarding? What happened? Did they both cling to this world because it was the last bastion of control that they had against family and society?
I loved watching this video...I feel like I know the two of them very well now and wish I could step back in time and knock on their door, just to chat for a few minutes with the two of them.",1303344000,6,1982,4.627840909090909

2664265,5,B000IY02W4,"The Beales Of Grey Gardens is essentially a continuation of Grey Gardens, the close-up portrait of two most intriguing and reclusive ladies, Big Edie and Little Edie who live in an old house called Grey Gardens. Once ladies of society with Grey Gardens standing as a stunning mansion, the house has now crumbled and we get the sense that even after Jacqueline Onassis and her husband helped them it just wasn't enough to carry them through. These ladies are peculiar and somewhat out of touch with the world yet they remain quite endearing; their mother-daughter bond is very strong and this film also gives us a great look at the profound dynamic of the mother-daughter relationship.

In the introduction to the film, Albert Maysles makes no bones about it: He states that since there has been such a fuss over the original film entitled Grey Gardens with people making it into a Broadway show, etc, he decided to release this additional footage of Big Edie and her daughter Little Edie to let us see more of them. He's ""cashing in;"" but the quality of what we get is excellent. He also says that Little Edie wanted to sing and dance in this extra footage--and she certainly does! Little Edie does a great deal of modeling and appears to take a child-like delight in showing off her outfits for the camera. Despite the passage of time Little Edie has retained a considerable wardrobe and we see lots of it as she parades and sings as she models for the camera.

We learn so much about these two women it's absolutely incredible. All you need to do is watch. We see them react with panic when a small fire breaks out in the house; fortunately it does not spread and there is no significant damage. We see Little Edie and her mother discussing romance, the town where they live, the Catholic Church and their beliefs about their religion in general including confession. There is some wonderful footage of Little Edie at the beach and we see how each lady relates to the Maysles' cameraman assistant, Jerry.

It's also interesting how emotionally connected these women are to their old house. Even after the renovations it's not exactly a great place to live; yet they hang on, living there as if little time had really passed since their glory days. That's very touching and I could tell they were very attached to that house, their property and all the memories that went along with that, too.

Of course, this is a documentary film that wants to paint a portrait of these two women and so therefore there isn't actually much of a plot; but don't let that fool you--it's fascinating to watch these ladies in action with the Maysles, Jerry and each other.

Except for the introduction with Albert Maysles there are no bonus features on this DVD; and that's a bit of a disappointment since this is part of the prestigious ""Criterion Collection."" However, the footage that we do get is excellent so I can almost overlook it. I would have liked an interview with a neighbor or two--or maybe even a relative.

The Beales Of Grey Gardens successfully provides us with remarkable insights into what made these women tick when they lived together; we also see how they related to each other and the filmmakers. I recommend this film.",1235088000,10,3226,4.680776014109347

No wonder they're living in ""la-la"" land - where everything is beautiful -- except reality, and if you watch it - you know what I mean.  I just cannot get over, and it's become part of my repertoire - the whole business of ""I don't like women in skuuuurrts - I like pants under the skurt, then you can bring the hose up over the pants under the skurt, and maybe wear the skurt as a cape.""  Please, I'm not laughing at them, these women spent a good part of their lives in agony - only they were forgiving enough to not recognize it as such.

2664274,2,B000IY02W4,"Showing up 30 years after the original, and undoubtedly here to capitalize on the smash Broadway play and upcoming fictional feature film, ""The Beales of Grey Gardens"" scoops up whatever was left on the editing room floor, puts them together like links of sausage and calls itself a movie. That's fine, they have some decent material here, but still this experiment of filming Jackie O's reclusive, deranged relatives is nothing more than a prehistoric ""Osbournes"". To its credit it feels much more organic as it is not burdened by MTV style editing or staged feuds with their neighbors. We just sit around and watch crazy people sink further and further into their own messed up world. Of course it is entertaining, but as a movie it doesn't really work. For a comedy it just isn't funny enough and for a tragedy it just isn't sad enough. How can we feel sad for these people, ignorance is bliss, as they say, and Big Edie and Little Edie are both more than stocked up in both departments.

I think a main theme here is taking yourself out of civilized society and entering an alternate reality. My hatred of people is well documented, but I am at least smart enough to surround myself with them for the sake of my own mental health. And so while I admit that I had a lot of fun at their expense I must emphasize the point that I am not judging them. How could I considering that my apartment looks like the Unabomber lives there, and that I eat ice cream out of the carton, and that I sit around prattling off conspiracy theories. Then again, I never danced around in front of my mother singing show tunes. And I certainly never burned a hole in my house and then had a raccoon come and take up residence within it. So like that trip to see the crazy old aunt nobody talks to anymore this trip begins to wear thin about an hour in.

With very few people around to stop their wild-eyed pontifications they just went on believing their own version of the truth. This becomes painfully apparent when Little Edie begins equating alcohol to ""orgies"" and ""exploding livers"". Later she rails against private and public property in the same rant, quite obviously not knowing the difference. It is my theory that when men go crazy they direct it outward, but when women go crazy everything is directed inward, and this is a perfect example. Little Edie means and does no harm to anybody else, but you listen to her talk for five minutes and you realize that this is one lost little girl. The film fails because, like Spike lee's ""Next Movement"", you really can't turn deleted scenes into a movie. They were deleted for a reason, not to mention that it is near impossible to create a narrative structure out of leftovers. **1/2",1182643200,15,2719,4.546938775510204
2664275,5,B000IY02W4,"Everyone else has already said how wonderful the ""new"" footage, how beautiful the scenery, how in-depth the exploration...I agree with them all.  I adore this film and am so grateful it has been made available (I would have taken it as raw footage).  I just wanted to mention that the subtitles are way off in many, many places.  I'm from Long Island, a native speaker of the LI accent, and I've seen Grey Gardens probably around 500 times.  I know what they're saying and it is not what is printed in the subtitles much of the time.  Perhaps whoever did the subtitles is not a LI native.  It's not really a complaint, but if you really want to know what they're saying you just have to listen closely and let your ear guide you, because if you take your info from the subtitles, it sometimes alters the actual meaning of what they're saying.  I hope this helps someone--it's my good deed for the day.",1181520000,49,901,4.4573170731707314
2664276,5,B000IY02W4,"Though I had watched ""Grey Gardens"" at least 2000 times since 1975, last fall, I went to the Castro Theater in San Francisco to see the new print of it with an audience for the first time since the Bouvier-Beales were introduced to me in '75.

That night, an appearance by Jerry Torre was incentive for me to see ""Grey Gardens"" on the big screen. I had just purchased the Broadway cast album and the song ""Jerry loves the way I do my corn"" was repeating in my brain as I waited in the long line to get into the theater.

Over 30 years of viewing, the Maysles film had made the Beales virtual friends of mine. Once upon a time, when I said that ""Grey Gardens"" was my favorite film, nobody had heard of it.

I did not know that a second feature would follow the interview with the ""Marble Fawn"".

As Ms. Beale pranced through the yard singing ""You Ought to be in Pictures,"" my heart felt as though I was visiting an old friend.

As true today as it was in 1975, you'll either be fascinated or repelled by ""The Beales of Grey Gardens."" I now have two favorite films.

8147697,5,B000IY02W4,"If you are a true Grey Gardens fan, this is a must have. I didn't know about it when I saw the original Grey Gardens documentary. When I found out about it, I was thrilled! More Grey Gardens! This one does not disappoint. One of the things I like about it is that it focuses more on Little Edie, who is the more interesting and likable character in my opinion. It is in the exact same format as the original--in fact it is just additional footage shot from the same documentary that was not in the original. More of Little Edie singing and flirting with the Maysles brothers. More scenes of Jerry the ""Marble Faun"" visiting with the Edies, their friend Lois comes for a visit as well.
In one scene, Little Edie opens the door as the Maysles arrive shouting ""help! The house is on fire and I can't find the fire!"" and they rush in to help her. Edie frantically stamps out the small fire with a blanket while shouting to her mother to please call the fire department, and the brothers pour water on the fire from bowls and buckets. Later, Big Edie dryly jokes to Little Edie that she didn't have to use the $300 blanket to put it out.
Scenes where Little Edie whispers and gossips to the brothers about different things, in her wonderfully expressive way. I think my favorite part is where they do a tribute to Little Edie by playing a lovely old song while showing clip after clip of her wearing her beautiful eccentric outfits, ones not seen before, as she sits, laughs, dances, twirls around,  lays out on the sun deck..
She talks about her relationship with the Catholic Church, she talks about politics, she gossips a little. It's just Little Edie being Edie in situations we haven't seen her before. Little Edie had a good heart and she was so interesting. I hope she knows that she became such a legend after she passed. I wish I could have known her! I really hope they release more footage over time....we know they have about 60 hours of footage but have only released 3 hours so far. Since the brothers have passed on, I hope that someone in their family will release more.",1504656000,4,2082,4.436031331592689
