I've just completed my first, but definitely not my last, viewing of ""Particle Physics for Non-Physicists: A Tour of the Microcosmos""

I don't begin to have the math/science background required to understand any in-depth physics lecture. But I love knowing how and why stuff works and things happen.  I'd read an occasional book - knew about Shrdinger and his cat, stuff like that - but usually hit a wall of incomprehension too early into the information to be able to understand it with any degree of whole-picturishness.  I appreciated Dr. Pollack's historical approach to the building of the standard model and the just-right level of detail he goes into in each brief fast-paced lecture.  I don't begin to say I understood all of it, but, paraphrasing Dr. Pollack, it's a very difficult subject to understand, so I just jumped in somewhere and rolled with it.  I was fascinated with the methodologies used to obtain the information obtained, wished I had known when I took chemistry in high school that the table of elements was way cool.  Sigh.

The Higgs-Boson discussion was great, particularly in light of subsequent events.

Dr. Pollack is a consummate teacher.  That he could take the vast amount of complicated material and effectively convey some significant amount of it to someone minus a background in physics, math, or chemistry, says it all.

The frosting on the cake -- I can now use particlelly in a sentence :)",1346457600,,1679,4.764705882352941
8242790,5,B0011VW1WW,"This lecture series isn't a Hollywood production. You won't be wowed by specials effects or antics. It takes a straight forward approach to teaching and is geared more towards beginners.

As one that doesn't have a formal educated in the field of physics, I found this series to be a useful tool. The fact that I'm almost totally autodidactic in the subject left obvious holes in my knowledge. Going back to the basics and addressing my weaknesses enhanced my ability to grasp more complex theories.",1276473600,,499,4.870588235294117
