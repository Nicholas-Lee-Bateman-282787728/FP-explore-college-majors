4389802,5,B004IZJL4Y,Amazing show. The metal gods are happy because Ronald James Dio is among them. 1000%. Long live rock and roll,1359849600,,109,4.5
4389803,5,B004IZJL4Y,"La calidad de imagen es increble, el sonido tambin. Altamente recomendable para los seguidores de DIO y los que recin se estn haciendo seguidores.",1359331200,,146,5.125
4389804,5,B004IZJL4Y,"I know it won't make me popular, but I own every Dio& Oz Sabb cd& dvd: this is the best ever. Very gothic, excellent setlist flow, well filmed, etc. Since they write & play better than ever, you get ultimate versions of most the Dio years canon & no IronMan or Paranoid. I literally swore off rock for 22 years then discovered this show, so I'm biased. I love this band, more so the new tunes. THE OPENING IS AWESOME!!! It's Iommi at his most lefthanded (in Latin ;)",1356480000,,466,4.247191011235955
4389805,5,B004IZJL4Y,"what a concert!! Dio will be missed. Sabbath definetly had life without Ozzy. Picture and sound are great in this DVD,. GET IT!!! LONG LIVE ROCK AND ROLL!! RIP Ronnie Jamse Dio.",1355097600,,177,4.5625
4389806,5,B004IZJL4Y,"What more is there to say? OK. This Blu-Ray is awesome!! I will watch it over and over. The quality is superb. The best video release I have ever seen. I still have yet to hear this with a proper surround sound system, but at home with Mackie's it is great. The bonus material is very cool. On my PC, the machine keeps freezing the picture and it really pisses me off. (windoze crud) But that is not a fault of the disc. I watch it on my friends Play Station and there is no freeze-up at all. So, if you are looking for top notch Sabbath concert video, do not hesitate to get this one. I am so glad I did. I can see clear close-ups of Toni's guitar and wah pedal.. and the drum kit is enormous. I've never seen anything like that one. And of course Ronnie's singing is right on.",1336953600,,778,4.058441558441558
4389807,4,B004IZJL4Y,"I am a big fan of Dio Sabbath, so I am very familiar with the few releases they did. Dio still has the magic in this performance! (RIP) The song selection is good and Appice on the drums is still solid. My only complaint is that the guitar mix needs a little more volume in the lossy format. I can't really comment on the mix in the HD audio encoding since I can't decode HD audio yet.",1320278400,,385,4.012987012987013
4389808,5,B004IZJL4Y,Radio City Music Hall is small for the size of these giants of Metal. Incredible performance of Black Sabbath with Dio in excellent shape. An excellent record of the last passages of this little giant! Long live R&R and RIP RJD!,1315008000,,228,4.585365853658536

Black Sabbath and Dio.

Just play loud!!!!!",1310947200,,139,4.75
4389810,4,B004IZJL4Y,"One of last taped performances by the great Ronnie Dio, especially when backed by members of Black Sabbath!  A must have for all rockers!",1308528000,,137,4.708333333333333
4389811,5,B004IZJL4Y,"Heaven & Hell Live at Radio City Music Hall is the definitive Heaven & Hell experience. The video quality is top-notch, the sound quality is incredible, and most importantly: we have an amazing setlist being performed by top-tier musicians at the top of their game.

I know what many of you are asking. ""Is this much of an improvement over the DVD?"" I can answer that with a very confident and resounding YES. I bought the DVD years ago after seeing them live at Metal Masters in 2008. The video quality is much better with no compression artifacts and very little color bleeding. Another problem that was noticeable to me on the DVD was really weird ghosting/motion blur of some kind. This is also gone in the Blu-ray release. Seeing this concert in high definition is a treat since you can catch so many small details, like scratches on Tony Iommi's guitar or the sequins on Dio's groovy shirts. Everything here looks fantastic.

The sound quality seems great to my ears. I don't have a speaker system to test out how crazy it can get, but it comes with HD audio, Dolby 5.1, and stereo. From what my TV speakers put out, everything sounds crisp and clear. The songs have varying mixes, such as Geezer Butler's bass lines dominating some tracks, while Tony Iommi's pounding riffs dominate others. I imagine that what we hear on this disc is what the band/sound engineers would want us to hear. It's perfect. See ""Die Young"" or ""Falling Off the Edge of the World"" for examples of the great mixing at work.

That brings us to the setlist, which is spectacular. You get material from the first three Sabbath Mk. II albums, Heaven & Hell, The Mob Rules, and Dehumanizer, along with some new tracks from the Dio Years compilation. This is a pretty long setlist and it doesn't disappoint. You get the expected hits like ""Neon Nights"" and ""The Mob Rules"" but for every one of those tracks you get a rarely played classic like ""Sign of the Southern Cross"" or ""Lonely is the Word.""

The band is in top form being filmed in the upward swing of their resurgence as gods of metal. Dio shows us that his voice, while sounding a bit aged, hasn't lost any of its power. Vinny Appice pounds the skins like he's going to be killed by a sniper if he doesn't hit them hard enough. He represents everything a professional drummer should be: a powerful, precise, timekeeper with a complete lack of vanity. His rhythm counterpart, Geezer Butler rocks the bass better than most whippersnappers half his age. He knows when to accentuate the riffs by following the guitar lines, and when to keep up the rhythm with his wild soloing. Tony Iommi, is of course, Tony Iommi. He plays heavy riffs of impending doom with ease. He has an amazing tone, and shreds with the very best of them without ever devolving into atonal noise.

If you love Black Sabbath, buy this. If you love Dio, buy this. If you love both, why are you even still reading? Click the button up there! If you don't have the DVD already, this is a no brainer. If you do, I still recommend this if you're on the fence. Give the DVD to your nephew or something! I think it's very much worth the improvement. You're getting an amazing concert with great video and sound. I cannot recommend this enough.",1306195200,42,3239,4.548885077186964
4389812,1,B004IZJL4Y,"This came and I did not watch it right away.  When I did I found that it did not work in any blue ray player that I tried.  I don't know what the deal is, but I will be contacting Amazon about getting a replacement.  When I tried it - it would only come up with ""Invalid disk""",1466467200,,276,3.7241379310344827
4389813,4,B004IZJL4Y,"This is a really great presentation.  Audio, video, editing (not too crazy frenetic like some concert vids), stage production, and performances are all sound.  The extras are also decent.  So why four stars instead of five?  Because RJD acts so freaking weird onstage that it's sometimes hard to watch.  He gestures like Celine Dion, chats up the crowd like Tom Jones, and fitzes with his hair like a preening old lady.  I don't get it, but if you were to cut out all of his between-the-song bits, this would earn one more star.",1464307200,,528,4.623655913978495
4389814,4,B004IZJL4Y,"I already had this show in DVD format. Now I've bought the Blu-ray disc without blinking.

Why? Because it is incredibly good. It is an official release featuring the Black Sabbath line-up with Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice. But, of course, the whoel thing is called ""Heaven & Hell"", because Iommi and Butler, at the time, were changing from joining Ozzy and joining Dio a lot! The last reunion with Dio brought to the market the album ""The Devil You Know"", and the following highly succesfull tour.

I think this show is very good. Set list is well paced and well chosen. There are the lately usual slow tempo songs, some of them are a little bit boring, but the rest is very good. I only missed ""Turn Up the Night"", from the MOB RULES album.",1461628800,,743,4.455882352941177

5 star DTS-HD Master Audio!

Witness the greatest metal vocalist of all-time RJD back with the band that created the genre as they DESTROY Radio City Music Hall, NYC!

As a long time fan of Black Sabbath, I love all the Ozzy & Dio years as equally as a fan can. The 3 Dio albums never seem to get quite the respect they deserve, especially Dehumanizer which is an absolutely fantastic album IMO. Of course Heaven & Hell is second to nothing in the entire Sabbath catalog! It's an absolute killer set list as you can see from the product info and they execute it to PERFECTION.

Like a lot of guys my age (47) and older we've seen RJD lay waste to many stage with a few bands you may have heard of? Rainbow, Dio, Black Sabbath and I think he gave us everything he had left in his tank and then some, and a class act. There will never be another like him in our time for sure. RIP RJD

At its current price it's an absolute steal.",1455580800,,963,4.133689839572193
4389817,5,B004IZJL4Y,"RIP Dio, this was an amazing show at Radio City which I had the pleasure of seeing live.  This Blu Ray captures the feel of that show perfectly.  The sound and picture are incredible and the performance is on point.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up.",1452902400,,254,4.25
4389818,5,B004IZJL4Y,"I don't usually enjoy concert videos.  Even when they are done well the instruments sound wrong and the vocalist is off key.  But I had seen several clips of this recording on YouTube, and marveled at how good everything sounded.  What really got me was how well everyone sounded together and how time had not diminished Ronnie James Dio's voice at all.  Truth be told, I prefer the version of ""The Mob Rules"" on this recording to the version on the 1981 studio album.  This is saying something as I almost NEVER prefer live versions.  So, given that Ronnie was my favorite Sabbath singer and that new material from him will no longer be coming, I decided to get this concert on Blu-Ray.  And I'm absolutely blown away by how good the picture quality really is, running through a high-def TV.  I would assume the sound is equally good, as it sounds fantastic on my TV speakers; I would get a good setup just for this alone, but my hearing was never good to begin with and has diminished over time and I just don't think I'm capable of hearing the subtleties any longer.  Still, this Blu-ray is a masterful work of concert engineering.  The colors are vivid and the details are crisp and sharp, and even the cameras are unobtrusive, or perhaps I'm just loving the picture so much I don't notice them.  Whatever it is, this video is nothing short of astounding, and if you love Dio and Sabbath, you can't help but enjoy it.",1449446400,3,1421,4.490272373540856

4389820,5,B004IZJL4Y,"This is pure Greatness from all included. Ronnie is great as always and the greatest guitarist in history Tony Iommi is amazing. Geezer and V Appice are Fn tear in it up! This is a better DVD than the one this band performed at Wakken for my own personal reasons, they perform ""Sign of a Southern Cross"" and ""Voodoo"" on this one. Both are must have's for any Sabbath, Dio, or just Metalhead or Heavy Music Junkie. RIP RJD you will be forever missed!!!!!!!!",1443744000,,456,4.440476190476191

Simply stunning in all aspects, camera work, production, vocals, and band all really on the top of their game! I'm glad to say I caught Dio around four or five different times over the years but say that I missed the last Heaven and Hell tour. A true metal LEGEND of Monsterous proportions that will live on forever. The old Sabbath songs are my personal favorites but the whole show delivers. Get this blu ray immediately if you do not own it!!

PS- I had to add an edit to this review to mention how incredibly cool the bonus features and interviews with RJD are in this set. Some of the best most intimate stuff you will ever see!!!",1374796800,,712,4.435114503816794

And last but not at all least, the late Ronnie James Dio (R.I.P.) is still at the top of his game with his unique and amazing vocals! This is one of Dio's finest performances and showcases the band at their best! I was fortunate enough to have attended this performance and I must say this DVD certainly captures the magic of Heaven & Hell that night!! Excellent production and 5.1 sound will rock you out of your seat! Get this Blu-Ray and you will not be at all disappointed!!
