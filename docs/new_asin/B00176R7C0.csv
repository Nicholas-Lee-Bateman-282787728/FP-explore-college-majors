8265112,5,B00176R7C0,"This is the book I recommend,  with dvd, for anyone who wants to learn to play the fiddle.  You learn a ton of songs that are super fun to play and that sound much more complicated than they really are.  Not that the book is easy,  but it is really well put together and the teaching is great. again,  get the dvd to help.  I completed the first book and some of the second without a teacher.  Then moved on to the suzuki method for violin.  I play several instruments and have more music books than I could remember,  but volume 1 of this series is one of the few where I learned every single song.  The only thing it doesn't do very well is teach you to play with others outside of these songs,  but who cares.  Once you get through these,  you'll be equipped to figure that out.",1423785600,,781,4.126666666666667
8265113,5,B00176R7C0,"Great follow on for AF 1.  Good music.  It makes learning the violin easy.
Both 1 & 2 should have more information about the importance of the shoulder support.",1391040000,,160,4.482758620689655
8265114,5,B00176R7C0,"This is a good instructional dvd for beginners and intermediate players. The instructor goes slow, and the split camera work shows him playing the tune and a close up on his fingering. The song selection is good and he gives some good pointers.",1309132800,,244,4.6976744186046515
8265115,5,B00176R7C0,This is DVD that goes along with the American Fiddle Method Vol 2 book.  The book must be purchased separately.  I bought this for my son who takes classical violin.  He enjoys learning the fiddle tunes on the side for fun.  The video is very professional and makes learning easy and fun!  I highly recommend this resource to anyone buying the book. . .especially if you benefit from visual learning.,1284163200,3,400,4.6571428571428575
