4481774,5,B004V3J3GY,"My Childhood back. Saw Crusader Rabbit on TV when I was 3 years old. Loved it then.
Corny now but fun to watch.
Great Show for Little Kids.
It should be brought back on television for them.
It beats all of the violence they see on today's TV Cartoons.
Then...you knew it was a cartoon and not real.
Now, the kids can't tell them from reality so they become violent without knowing it.
I don't believe in Censorship. I believe in Common Sense of what children should see and hear in the Media and on TV.  Let kids have their childhood and not give them information that confuses them on Life before they have a chance to grow up.

4481775,5,B004V3J3GY,"Nobody has the complete Crusader Rabbit cartoons available, but it would be an understatement to say this is a very good collection.  I've bought these DVDs for myself and for other collectors.  For anyone not familiar with the series, this was created by J.Ward before he went on to Rocky & Bullwinkle, he worked on the earlier cartoons and his influence can be seen in the later ones.  It is not a pale warm up to the later great series, no matter what people who haven't seen the cartoons may tell you.  Imagine what you'd get if Bullwinkle had teamed up with tough, sneaky old Bugs Bunny instead of boy scout Rocky and you have Rags the Tiger and Crusader Rabbit.
Collectors interested in further Crusader Rabbit shows might try various dealers on the Internet or science fiction conventions.",1365033600,4,796,4.705035971223022

4481779,3,B004V3J3GY,"I have just purchased the Crusader Rabbit DVD set.

I remember these cartoons were on in the mornings, during the early 60s here in Australia.  They used to be short cartoons in episode form with suspenseful lead-outs to the next mornings episode.

As a youngster, I remember the Crusader Rabbit theme and him rocking back an forth on his horse at the beginning of each new episode.  I am a little bit disappointed that the indvdual cartoons have been edited into a feature length format for each story, on this DVD set.

Part of the charm of the cartoons was the opening segment tune and the short episode format.  But, it is still a good DVD set and I will enjoy watching it anyway.

Regards, Stephen.",1327190400,9,703,4.531746031746032
4481780,5,B004V3J3GY,"I remember watching Crusader and Rags as part of an afternoon show called ""Cartoon Carnival"" that aired on one of our 3 local TV stations while I was still in the single digit years.  That was probably in 1959 or 60 and I hadn't seen hide nor ""hare"" of them in (ugh!) 50 years!  I was reading about Rocky and Bullwinkle a while ago and there was a mere mention of Crusader Rabbit that started the theme music from the cartoons playing in my head like I'd heard it yesterday.  I did a Web search and learned quite a bit about the how, when and by whom the series was made.

 Several sites mentioned that a few episodes had been released on VHS years ago and they have been known to pop up on the cheapo cartoon collection DVD's, but complete stories have been impossible to find.  There seems to have been a long-running copyright battle over this material, but it looks like it's fallen into the public domain.  I was pleased to find this collection on Amazon.

 The cartoons were made on the cheap 60 years ago and the animation is somewhat limited, but the stories and jokes are surprisingly good.  Not quite up to par with Rocky and Bullwinkle, but these were the early days of TV, with practically nonexistent budgets and limited time to put the episodes together.  The overall quality of the DVD transfers is decent; the sound is a little tinny and scratchy, but that's what TV was like back then!  The only thing I don't really like about this set is that they run the opening credits on each segment, along with the synopsis of the previous one a la Rocky and Bullwinkle.  I suppose that adds authenticity and the ""purists"" would complain if it were omitted, but it does get a bit annoying if you sit down and watch a whole story.

 The set is provided on DVD-R discs, but they play just fine on my computer and set-top Blu-Ray machine.  I'm just a little skeptical about the long term survival of recordable media.",1325462400,16,1922,4.433048433048433
4481781,4,B004V3J3GY,"This is literally the first animated cartoon series made specifically for TV rather than theatrical airing. I believe it was shown on ""Captain Kangaroo,"" although that may not be the first airing as I was born the year it was first released. It originally ran from 1950 to 1952.

Each episode is very short and the animation was cheaply done (lots of non-motion frames), the first several story lines in black and white, the later ones in color. The characters got cuter as the series progressed as well.

This was the infamously wonderful Jay Ward's first animated series. Unfortunately, he lost the rights to it to his partner in an ugly legal battle, the happy outcome of which was, of course, that Ward went on to create the legendary ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" series. Ward refused to discuss the initial series in the mid-seventies when I met him as he was still too upset about it; luckily I was able to purchase a hand-painted cell of Crusader that Ward signed only after I stumped him with a question about another of his series, ""George of the Jungle"". The copyright to the Crusader series was allowed to lapse, this distributor retrieving it from public domain.

Obviously, the adventures of Crusader Rabbit and his (Bullwinkle-like) Rags the Tiger is somewhat primitive and not as funny as Ward's later efforts. It's a wonderful relic, however, that fans of vintage animated cartoons will treasure.

Despite the notice that there are flaws in the transfer, the quality of the episodes on these three discs is quite good, both the visuals and the sound. The menu allows the viewer to skip through the episodes easily or watch an entire story line all the way through without interruption. All the episodes ever made are on this set.

I highly recommend this to collectors and anime historians that hasn't been available in decades apart from one story line (the Sahara one) released on VHS by a small distributor in the 1970s. It's a classic view of primal Ward humor.",1305158400,55,1973,4.791176470588235

4481799,3,B004V3J3GY,"I call this a new nostalgia trip because even though I watched Crusader Rabbit as a kid, I don't remember ever having seen any of these stories before.  I found the two earliest crusades(Crusader vs. State of Texas, Crusader vs. The Pirates) to be the most interesting because they didn't talk down to a kid audience; the narration is rather elevated in tone and choice of words.  The subject matter at times draws eerie parallels to historical events(jackrabbit deportation centers seem like internment camps to me).  Many jokes probably amused the writers more than the viewing audience.  The later stories in color benefit from better animation and the writing of Chris Hayward, who later gave us Peabody's Improbable History and Fractured Flickers for Jay Ward Productions.

My qualms with this set have to do with the way the later stories were pieced together from individual episodes; there are many breaks of continuity which give an overall cheap impression to this set.  I'm not blaming the manufacturers; they probably had pieced-together source material.  The early stories, which are in four minute segments, actually hang together much better.  I recommend watching these stories in small doses anyway; it's truer to the original nature of  these things.  Too much at one time reveals the writing to be very formulaic; the stories all seem to end rather abruptly and not always well resolved.

I would recommend this set to people who are interested in animation history and in seeing where Rocky and Bullwinkle evolved from.  The set is an interesting reflection of the 50's in many ways.  The satirical writing is excellent(e.g., The New York Crankees managed by K.C. Strangle, a villianess named Simone Legree).  If another set were to become available, I would probably buy it.",1392854400,5,1795,5.081911262798635
