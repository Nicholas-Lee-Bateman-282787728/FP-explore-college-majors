1892253,5,B00009W2GQ,"It seems that Agent Smith will infect the entire matrix and all its inhabitents and only Neo can stop him...
The battle will begin!!
IT WILL RULE!",1054771200,,146,4.444444444444445
1892254,5,B00009W2GQ,"Neo using powers outside the matrix?  It was the other ship using the weapon?  Is the future world another matrix in a chain of matrix within the matrix?  Is the whole story the dream world of Neo, and every human being has independent dreams?
  I would like to think that neo really could use his powers outside the matrix in the real future world.  HE said that he could feel them coming.  Are the machines entitys that exist only if we think they exist?  Isn't God the same thing?  God only exist if we think He (or She) exist.  Are the machines dependent on our will?
  I think that the movie trys to tell us that the social system only exist if we think it exist.  As a matter of fact, society is an invention of sociology.  If we choose to, we can ""shut down"" the system that opress us if we have the will to do it.",1054771200,7,821,4.113924050632911
1892255,5,B00009W2GQ,"I like everybody who have written reviews have not yet seen this film, but can hazard a guess as to what will happen. I suspect, having seen that neo can use his powers in the ""real world"", that it isn't the real world at all but a matrix, and the world they believe to be the matrix is infact a matrix within a matrix. Confused? well me too, and i suspect the movie itself will be even more confusing than my theorys. As for some other reviews that have said that it wasn't in fact neo who stopped the machines but a nearby ship using an EMP remains to be seen, if it was a nearby ship, then it is most likely to be the one that rescued them, and we have yet to hear them say anything about it. As for agent smith being in the real world, we are still to see wether that was a dream or not, i suspect not. anyways it looks set to be one hell of a movie.",1054425600,7,854,3.8857142857142857
1892256,3,B00009W2GQ,I would give a rating of three star(at first) as the movie could contain lots of action pact within a short time frame of creating one....fantastic....superman style of making movies..hee hee....it will be a big astonishment if big waves of people go for this one but ending up with a so so movie...hee hee...its showtime for this coming November....:-),1053043200,2,353,5.0
1892257,2,B00009W2GQ,"I recently rewatched this movie, and yeah, it's as mediocre as I remember. I guess this is what happens when the creators run out of ideas from their freshman stoner philosophy.

The Wachowskys love kung-fu movies, so there's plenty of pointless kung fu. Plus pointless gunfights. Need to spice one up a little? Have the baddies walk on the ceiling - and get slaughtered all the same.

If they had thought to do something interesting, like have Neo and the Merovingian make a deal to take on Smith, this could have been interesting. Or if they had given the luscious Monica Belluci more than a token line.

But, sadly, they just bulled through pointless mech battles to a final Christ allegory. Deus literally ex machina. Great CGI, unfortunately harnessed to a trite and pointless story.",1506384000,2,788,4.822222222222222

1892264,4,B00009W2GQ,"There's still lots of filler exposition and filler action, but at least it gets the sour taste of the second film out of your mouth. If you want to walk away feeling awesome though, maybe rewatch the original film and savor that. CGI sequences during the final fight are much less obvious and much more dramatic than those in the previous film.

1892270,5,B00009W2GQ,"The Entire Trilogy is an amazing story, trying to give us a window that encompasses many great spiritually based books and archetypes. The Bhagavad Gita is one book that comes to mind, to Greek mythology  ""Persephone"" was the Merovingian (Jesus bloodline), the wife.  She who brought light from darkness and was the daughter of Zeus. The ""as above so below, laid down by the Emerald tablets also is mirrored in the movies and the Duality of the Concepts of Father (Archetect White/Male) and Mother (Oracle Black/Female) with a born son, Neo is the""NEW"" that is protected by the TRINITY, one cannot escape all of this.  If you dig deep into all these movies you will find answers that may awaken you.  It is not an action movie after all. REMEMBER, You take the blue pillthe story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pillyou stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I'm offering is the truth.

1892273,3,B00009W2GQ,3 stars that's it! The first one was Excellent. Second part was Great but you had to watch the third but the third was way too off course. It went from Hackers to People living in a third world country with Terminator types of machine's. Keenu Reeves wasn't really in it. The last Matrix was ok. I guess Good,1499731200,,308,4.237288135593221
1892274,2,B00009W2GQ,First movie is 5/5. Second is 3/5. The last is the worst. It's incredibly boring/repetitive until the last 20 or so minutes.,1499644800,,124,4.681818181818182
1892275,1,B00009W2GQ,None of the reviewers are self-aware or other-aware to the matrix.  The Matrix is real.  The cynicism of it is that it made a movie for us of us with it>but it is more powerful than it even presents itself in these movies.,1499558400,,222,4.1395348837209305
1892276,2,B00009W2GQ,"Third movie is the completion of the steep decline the Matrix took in its sequels.

1892279,3,B00009W2GQ,"The final installment kind of goes off the rails for me a little bit. The mythology and storytelling gets overwhelming. Awesome action scenes, but you go through huge chunks of the movie without the leads and the conclusion is somewhat vague and anticlimactic. Perhaps it's delusional of me, but I was hoping for a happier ending. This is definitely a trilogy where the first one is so incredibly good that it's almost with forgetting that there story continued, but it's by no means a horrible film.",1499126400,3,500,4.825581395348837

1892337,4,B00009W2GQ,"Small Spoiler Alert

The third movie in the Matrix series, remarkably, it is nearly as good as the first, carrying it's own weight without relying too heavily on the previous films.  However, to understand every aspect of it, one needs to watch the previous two films.  There are elements that require a person to know the history of the world it it based in, along with the history between the various characters.  Since it focuses primarily on the ""outer world"", it could just as easily be understood as a man v machine story with humans fighting for their survival with a savior playing the sacrificial lamb on order for the humans to survive.  It is a good story in and of itself, but works best when viewed in order, so that people may understand the relationship between the powers that be in the 'virtual world'.",1472601600,,819,4.620689655172414

1892374,4,B00009W2GQ,"An action packed finish to an iconic trilogy, this one too suffers from the statue-esque acting that plagued its predecessors. Hopefully you've been paying close attention up to this point, otherwise you might find yourself lost in what's not the best presented story of all time.

The not-so subtle imagery gets a little droll at times, but at this point you're probably used to that and just want to watch two guys duke it out for the fate of the world in front of a green screen, and you'll get all of that and more. It's definitely not a bad action flick, and a solid conclusion to the trilogy.",1471910400,,598,4.486238532110092

1892377,2,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions continues the unfortunate detour of the Matrix Reloaded away from the promising premise of the Matrix into an overlong and plodding ""predestination"" resolution.  The film also suffers for being mostly set in the ""real-world"" - a place far less developed and interesting than the Matrix itself.  From the promise of Zion as ""the last human city"" (a gray concrete shaft next to a cave) to a world ending invasion by an army of machines (just sentinels - no other robots of any shape or size) to the final battle between Smith and Neo, all fail to live up to expectations.  Ultimately, the ""twist"" ending reveal of the Matrix Reloaded has robbed our heroes of much of their agency.  As our protagonist hurtles toward his ""destiny"" we feel less involved in his struggles and choices, given what both we and he knows about his ultimate fate.",1471824000,,859,4.783783783783784

It is yet another unnecessary sequel and I found it painful to watch. There is nothing thought provoking in this film. It is a complete inversion of THE MATRIX. It seemed like a bad dream. More-so, it seemed like a bad imitation of a Saturday matinee movie. That goes to the point. THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS has a Saturday matinee movie mentality, but it can't even pull that off. The more I watch this film, the more I want to turn it off and just go back original THE MATRIX. There is something very extraordinary about the original.

Chinese guy tries to take over the role of Neo when he gets lost inside the matrix, but why? Is he adding new style of fighting? Not at all.  Is he better looking than Neo? Not at all.

1892566,4,B00009W2GQ,"The conclusion to the epic Matrix trilogy should have been the best of the three films. Everything was set up perfectly leading into a potentially exciting conclusion, and most of the film went as expected. There was terrific action and science fiction drama, some amazing special effects, and the legend of Neo continued to grow, right up until the conclusion. The end of the film went from extremely predictable to ridiculously strange and confusing. While I'm sure the ending made perfect sense to the Wachowski's, it made no sense to me, an avid science fiction fan and movie critic. This being a review, means I can't go into specifics, but the ending was absolutely horrible and puts the whole series in a different light. The most disheartening part of this whole thing is that until that point, the Matrix has been done to near perfection. The story was solid, the action was out of this world, the special effects were amazing, the casting was flawless, and just when the trilogy should have reached it's apex, it all comes crashing down. Once again the cast is terrific and the story is great, which is why I don't understand how they could give us an ending like that. I thoroughly enjoyed the Matrix trilogy and it will certainly hold it's place in cinematic history, but as a fan I was horribly disappointed by an ending that came out of nowhere and left the audience scratching it's head.",1404000000,,1402,4.726530612244898

the year is 2000

Warner Bros. to the Warchowskis>>>""your film ""The Matrix"" did real well last year....we got to have a sequel!!""

Warchowskis to Warner Bros.>>>> (silence)

Warchowskis>>> ""Uhh, we haven't really conceived a sequel""

Warner Bros.>>>>""We will not only finance the film, but we will make sure the cast members return, & we will double the budget & triple your pay from the first film""

Warchowskis to each other>>>>> ""what are we going to do?"".......""we will just make it up as we go"".......""yeah....after all, it has an audience, we won't have to be as creative this time around""......""yeah....let's just take the money while this offer is valid""..........""yeah.....the audience can figure it out""......",1402531200,3,1254,4.724770642201835

1892629,5,B00009W2GQ,"First off I have this DVD already in my collection, unfortunately it was not purchased on Amazon. But with a new Kindle Fire for Christmas and a  long plane trip I thought I would try out the download feature of the Fire. I was able to download this to my kindle fire to save for later, did Rent this version that my husband enjoyed to watch when on the plane.. It took a while to download as my AT&T DSL internet can crawl at times, but it did load correctly with no issues. Movie played with no glitches and the long trip on a cramped plane seemed like just a few minutes than the 3 hr flight, and it was on sale in the rental dept.

1892631,3,B00009W2GQ,Overall the trilogy was intriguing and put together as well as can be expected.  There's no doubt that the first movie catapollted the expectations of the series well beyond anyone's reach but I feel that this movie encapsulated as much of the mystic of the matrix and made itself it's own movie. Overall movie was good characters an plot where all inline. This movie follows more of the human side of the war which left me wanting to see more of the matrix.  I hope they continue the matrix series.,1392249600,,499,4.533333333333333
1892632,5,B00009W2GQ,I liked it because it had alot of action and music. I also liked it because i didn't freeze and other movie companies tend to freeze.,1392163200,,133,4.153846153846154

1892636,4,B00009W2GQ,Good movie. Enjoyed special effects. Kept your attention. It was a little hard to follow at times. Need to watch closely.,1391990400,,121,4.809523809523809
1892637,1,B00009W2GQ,The Matrix Revolutions was so boring that I couldn't make it through half of the movie. Watch the original again or read a book instead.,1391990400,,136,4.48

1892641,4,B00009W2GQ,It was almost as good as the first matrix. And it was better than the second matrix movie. Great acting.,1391817600,,104,4.25
1892642,2,B00009W2GQ,Maybe some kids would like this movie with attaching machines but we were very sorry we ever turned this movie on and don't know why we didn't just quit watching as the script was horrible; acting poor and events unbelievable. We would definitely not recommend this movie unless you are into science fiction.,1391731200,,308,4.830188679245283

1892646,5,B00009W2GQ,"What's to say, if you are a Matrix fan it's a great movie. The conclusion of the trilogy. I do not recommend starting with this one if you haven't seen the original, as you will be lost without the story line.

HD was crisp with good sound and streamed well.",1391558400,,258,4.16

1892653,3,B00009W2GQ,Final story in the Matrix trilogy. Story seems a bit convoluted but decent ending. Apparent that this series was never meant to be a trilogy because of all the plot holes in Part 2 and 3. Overall not bad...,1391299200,,206,4.3076923076923075

1892663,3,B00009W2GQ,"If not quite as precipitous as the ridiculous part 2, The Matrix Revolutions still marks quite a sharp drop from the steep brilliance of the Matrix proper. It's still watchable if only for the accrued realization of just how boring Zion is - we all know Cypher was right - and a cheap chuckle at its chicken little fighting devices. The brothers ran out of steam, not to say imagination; everything here feels sub-par and disneyified.",1390867200,,434,4.723684210526316

1892669,4,B00009W2GQ,"Great series that ended on a somewhat sour note.  No spoilers.  Awesome characters, effects and story.  The ending left me going ""What the...?"" Had to watch it a few times.  Still not sure I fully understand it.  Has there been a smoother bad guy than Agent Smith in the last decade?  He is the Hans Grueber (Die Hard) of the new millennium.",1390262400,,341,4.419354838709677

1892675,3,B00009W2GQ,"The First two were ground breaking... This one, not so much. The predictable dialogue makes the ending a bit on the cheesy side.",1389830400,,128,4.608695652173913
1892676,3,B00009W2GQ,The ending seemed to drag on a bit longer than it needed to and the fighting and flying didn't seem very believable,1389744000,,115,4.2727272727272725

1892684,5,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix rates up there with star wars, lord of the rings. You can not rate this saga anything but 5 stars. Usually the sequel will go down in budget and change cast. Not in this saga. it holds true through out each movie with the actors, special effects and story line.

1892698,5,B00009W2GQ,"I've seen this movie at least six times but this time it was fresh! Everyone knows the story of Neo and the crew, but for some reason the Prime Account streaming was exceptionally clear. The HD was so sharp that it almost appeared as 2.8D!!!

1892706,3,B00009W2GQ,The Matrix has a definitive theology which is to deny the Judeo-Christian worldview by presenting an alternative explanation. It falls short. But overall the movie is an interesting fantasy and story.,1388880000,,200,5.483870967741935

Spoiler alert!
Simple plot summary: Machines attack Zion (first 2/3rds of movie). Neo fights Smith (last 1/3rd) and Zion is saved.

Here's the detailed plot summary: Bad guys invade Zion. Zion fights back for as long as it can as the situation becomes ever more hopeless. Lots of shooting of sentinel robots. Neo and Trinity fly to machine city (Neo destroys some sentinels with magical powers). Neo makes a deal with the machine god and enters the matrix to kill the renegade program ""Smith"".

1892766,5,B00009W2GQ,"If you bought the premise in the first film, you had plenty of motivation to see where things led to in the second and then the third and last film of the Matrix trilogy.  Usually I have found such film series as being largely empty rehashes of what people bought tickets for last time.  But that was not true at all with the Matrix movies.

My feeling at the end of the last film was one of great satisfaction for a story well and convincingly told.  True, not every plot angle was nicely tucked into bed by the end of the third film.  Given that people don't always make up their beds some open plot points are to be expected.

But what was abundantly clear is that there will be some period of days ahead for humans to make choices.  Important choices.  Some will be good choices, some catastrophically bad choices, but all will be interesting given the writers' dedication not to make things too easy for the viewers and yes -- even the thinkers who wonder what happens next.

Kudos to all those involved in spinning the plot so artfully and being willing to introduce new characters and add new depth to characters encountered in the second film and even going all the way back to the first.  Some of the performances in the second film clearly shallowly introduced incredibly interesting characters deliberately who would someday come into their own, but not quite yet.  Much of that makes this movie a worthy rental provided you have seen the first two films.",1387065600,,1466,4.557251908396947

The special effects for the original were groundbreaking, and it seems like they decided, if a little bit of special effects makes the movie good, a ton of special effects with make the movie great....wrong.",1386979200,,393,4.6
1892771,5,B00009W2GQ,"I'm always impressed by the more improbable special effects. The collective mind of mankind always seeks a means of explaining the potential hazards of one human in charge of our digital destiny. Here, the Christ like figure in Keanu Reeves character fills the bill of our future savior rather nicely. We all wish that reality were as simple as that one savior who could change our destiny.
Alas, we are still searching after that one Christ to return and change things permanently for the better.
Maybe after all, we are all Christlike collectively. If we'll only realize it.
But still here we are with multiple divisions over whose Christ is best.

Cannot, therefore, speak as The Voice of Experience, make comparisons with others in the series or in other series. I got a kick out of it, not because of anything it says or means, but because of the pyrotechnics as seen, as we used to say in a more primitive period, in my low-fi outfit. Had seen the predecessor but have watched too much other content since then, so that I was in the dark for the first few scenes until I grabbed hold of the thread of what to watch for here. Not sure it made any difference how good the actors were, probably they did well since I had nothing to complain of. Naturally, with all that cockamamie dialogue endemic to sci-fi films, I don't expect that even a Spencer Tracy or Ronald Colman (to pick just two guys or knew how to deliver the written word admirably) could make sci-fi speech sound other than it is.

I had that set on dvd and didn't want to upgrade the whole thing to blu-ray, but I did want to at least have the movies by themselves on blu-ray. My wish came true when Wal Mart started selling 'The Matrix' and 'Matrix Reloaded' in what was basically their bargain bins. They were the movies with ALL the features on them for 10 or 8 dollars - something like that. Upgrades. So I waited and waited to see if 'Matrix Revolutions' would be sold that way - but no - it never appeared. It was like it was stuck in that train station that Neo is stuck in, in this movie. So I paid the 20-25 bucks from one of the other sellers to get it before it disappeared entirely from retailers. THIS IS a Canadian disc, by the way, so it might act a little weird when your player gets it but if your firmware is up-to-date then it should still play. For whatever reason they must have simply decided not to sell this movie by itself in the States so if you find it by itself from one of the other retailers, it's a Canadian disc and that may be why the price is a little higher.

  To me, the whole Matrix was an allegory. An allegory of how our lives have become more and more  engulfed by technology. Our lives have become hijacked by technology, our own creation. Phones,Facebook,Twitter,and other entities alike,have deprived us of pure human interactions; everything has been digitalized to just a vestige of the true joy of seeing a beautiful smile on someone's face, the smirk on a lover's face, the fascination in the eyes of a child, the warmth of someone's embrace.

An entrepreneurial colleague asked if I'd seen The Matrix. Said he believes it and that's how he runs his business. So I put my name on the waiting list at the library. Turned out, I got _Revolutions_ with the library code taped over the title so I didn't know what I had without searching it out. I did realize when the film started that something was missing. (I'd seen the first in the trilogy years ago.)

Some of my notes:

""No one can see beyond a choice they don't understand."" -- The Oracle (perhaps the most profound line in the film, and, in my opinion, the crux of both the film and of business)

We are each good and evil - the savior and the destroyer.

Some things in this world never change. Luckily, some things do.

""Did you always know?"" (Neo to Oracle) ""No,"" Oracle to Neo, ""but I believed.""

There's more, of course.

PACING: Though the battle scenes are the most technologically advanced in history, they were a little long for my taste. They added little to the plot, and were basically visual candy for people who like that sort of thing.

EXTRA FEATURES: Revolutions Recalibrated

I watched as much as I could of the extra features, the making of the film and the behind the scenes footage. It's astonishing how live action, animation, miniatures, and computer graphics flowed together -- as the director said, they used every form and technology available - including processes that were not available when the first movie came out. How they blended them all together - flawlessly - is amazing.

It was also entertaining to watch Keanu Reeves lie down in a pool of muddy water - smiling - and informative to hear Jada Pinkett Smith talk about the amount of bruises sustained during filming.

While sometimes seeing how special effects are created can dilute the magic of a film, in this case, I think the revelations enhanced its power.

THE GAME
Disc 2 also introduces the Matrix online game, playable by thousands of people simultaneously who script it as they play. Must be a gamer's paradise.",1287187200,,2039,4.680672268907563
1892894,4,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix trilogy truly resides in my mind as the the best sci-fi trilogy of the 90s/21st Century, full mind-blowing action. The Matrix Revolutions may not be as memorable as The Matrix or The Matrix Reloaded, but it is definitely worth watching. Picking up right after The Matrix Reloaded, the fate of Zion rests in the balance of Neo.

The films starts great with an excellent chase scene in The Matrix to save Neo, the middle of the film contains contains a spectacular battle sequence as the machines invade Zion, and a Superman style fight amazes me the most at the end. The Wachowski Brothers are truly genius when it comes to satisfying an audience, a great score also helps enthrall us. The only downside to the film is it can be very dull at times between the big fight sequences.

The only available DVD version is the 2-Disc version which is great! The movie can be found quite cheap quite often, and it is worth the price (I would pay 30 for it!).

1892899,5,B00009W2GQ,"The stunning conclusion to the Wachowski brothers ""Matrix"" trilogy comes to life. Highly controversial at it's release, the film has since never quite redeemed itself in eyes of the fans of the series. As a side note, this film might recieve better reception as time goes on, much like ""Alien 3"" although this is simply speculation.

The film begins almost the second its predecessor ended, Neo is unconcious, with the he's-got-to-be-up-to-no-good Bane lying right beside him. The film almost immediately throws itself back into the computer world with the revelation that the Morovingian isn't quite done with our leather-clad heroes yet.

One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the extended focus on the people of Zion. It frequently breaks away from the main characters to focus on the less developed ones which were introduced in the previous movie. While the ominous buzzing of the machines comes ever closer, the people of Zion prepare for what they know will be their final battle. I particularly liked the development of Kid, a character only breifly touched upon in ""Reloaded"" gets a nice portion of the spotlight while defending Zion.

While humans and machines clash, Morpheus, Niobe and their crew come to aid in the battle at their home. Niobe's character undergoes much development during this period, proving her loyalty to the human race.

One of the films only weaknesses is the lack of focus on Neo and Trinity, who are completely absent for a large portion of the film. Their characters never really undergo any development, with the exception of an extremely powerful sequence toward the end.

The reason that Revolutions, in my mind, was a success was because of the ending. The Wachowski brothers don't waste time showing what occurs afterwards, they simply end the story, telling it the way they wanted to tell it. This is one of the things I really like about the brothers, they don't sell out on their vision and let the filmmaking norms taking over their story. They tell their story, not the story that the audience EXPECTS or WANTS to see, but the story THEY want to tell, which is what filmmaking is really about.

If you are a die-hard fan of the Matrix or just a person who has a tendancy to like deeply misunderstood movies, watch this.

1892910,2,B00009W2GQ,"""The Matrix Revolutions"", the last in the Wachowski brothers' super sci-fi trilogy, is a mixed bag of criticism.  Most of us already know what everybody else thinks based upon the surprisingly low opening weekend box office of $48.5 million that the film barely scraped, a direct reflection upon the consensus of  the ""Matrix Reloaded"" back in May of `03.  That's right, folks - for those who were disappointed with ""Reloaded"", ""Revolutions"" will only upset your expectations even further.  For those who eat up every fat morsel that the film industry serves up piping hot from the griddle of hype (the teaser trailers in combination with the cheeky Powerade TV ads), you'll love it pound for gluttonous pound.

The remainder of this now flaccid storyline has Zion up crap creek without a paddle, their firepower no match for the hundreds upon thousands of Sentinels about to breach the core of the city.  There is something afoot in the Matrix as well - the malicious Agent Smith (Weaving) has proliferated himself throughout the entire system and is more than prepared for a final confrontation with Neo (Reeves).  However, Neo is preoccupied with what measures must be taken to ensure the safety and survival of Zion whilst Trinity (Moss) ever-faithfully prepares herself to accompany him on his most perilous mission yet.

As exciting as this apocalyptic final chapter sounds, you know you've lost something when the story completely overwhelms the characters.  Neo, Trinity and Morpheus used to be some pretty damned interesting folks.  In the film that began it all, Neo was introduced as a cocksure novice who slowly but surely realizes his true potential.  Trinity was a strong and admirable yin to Neo's yang, a woman equipped with a lethal combination of beauty and brains.  Morpheus was a wise but humble seeker of truth, a teacher not abject to learning from others.

Where the hell did these people go?

They were killed off by one deadly mechanism: FRANCHISE.  This was the point at which art was sacrificed for profit and the Wachowskis lost themselves in the high-tech impressionism of computer graphics imaging.  What started as a fantastic premise full of possibilities has resorted to eye-candy for the action movie catalog, a by-product of overzealous marketing.

Aside from this noticeable change in the scheme of things is another inexplicable move - the film's grandiose conclusion.  Many people will be baffled as well as fuming, the ending leaving more questions with nothing to provide any answers.  The most significant resulting quandary is why some of us chose to spend nine dollars on over two hours of visual excess only to be swindled by a cryptic ending.  Sorry to say that the entertainment industry has suckered the lot of us once again.

Let's face it - the only real fun to be had here is by the actors and you gotta hand it to Hugo Weaving - he's successfully managed to find himself a character in which he can completely indulge in all its salacious evil.  The bad guys always seem to have more fun in overwrought productions such as this and Weaving is clearly having a blast as Smith, cackling and smirking to the hilt while his markedly arched eyebrows and piercing blue eyes consume the screen.

Reeves, on the other hand, puts no more energy into his acting than what's required and let's face it - there isn't much of a requisite for emotion.  His designer wardrobe, stylish shades and killer moves are the real showcase and Reeves excels at this but nothing more.  Moss retains her cool surface as does Fishburne, along with Pinkett-Smith as the resolute Niobe.  Don't expect much to change; these are repeat performances, after all.  Mary Alice joins the cast as the Oracle and the presence of a new face in a familiar role is only a bittersweet reminder of Gloria Stuart's passing (a vague explanation was written into the script for why the Oracle appears physically different).

Bottom line: If you're just dying to know how it all ends, go ahead and spend the few bucks to rent it.  Just don't expect to be illuminated or amused by it all (or to get your money back!).",1214179200,10,4120,4.854077253218884

It was written up in newspapers, people took off work to see it when it opened the first day.  Theaters were sold out and lines were unbelieveable.  And then the let down and dissappointment that followed.  When I went to see the film, the auditorium for this movie was empty.  And the movie had only been open less than a week.  And it was easy to see why.  The ending of the movie was a terrible dissappoinment. Real life is tough, I like happy endings in my entertainment, and I did not get it here.  I was waiting for Neo to save the day, to reunite with his lover, to either overcome the machines, or to negociate some sort of peaceful co-existance between humanity and the machines.  The wonderful idea, played with in the first two films, that there was, within the machine complex, programs that had gained invidvidual conciousness and action, who wanted to go on existing as individuals and make peace with humanity, was not brought to any kind of fruition here.  Neo died without purpose. The lovers are lost forever. The human race was not saved--the machine world was. The machine world will continue as before, with humanity being used as living batteries.  The free city of Zion, while not totally destroyed, is now no longer secret, and secrecy was their only true defense.  The machines now know where Zion is, and can destroy all free humanity whenever they become too much trouble. Where in the first film, it seemed that Neo was humanity's hope against the machines, it turns out that the machine had used Neo to preserve itself. He dies for nothing; his sacrifice, humanity and love gone to waste. He dies to preserve the machine world.  Personally, I would have preferred that the human race perish than continue forever in this world as fodder for the machine complex.  And what in the world happened to the character of Morpheus?  Morpheus was strong, dignified, a powerful leader in the first two movies. In this one, his character has totally changed.  He bearly appears onscreen, and when he does, he is fearful, weak, ineffectual and completely useless.  Others take over the leadership role and Morpheus is religated to the background.  Nothing comes of the terrible sacrifices that he suffered.  And the action sequences in the film really did nothing for me.  In one scene, the rogue computer program Agent Smith appears as a plodding giant in a stylized cityscape---for all the world like the Staypuffed Marshmallow man scene from the Ghostbusters!!  Doesn't it occur to anyone in Hollywood that a movie with a happy ending sells better?  This movie ranks in the same dissappointment range as the third movie of the Pirates of the Caribbean does.",1210204800,6,2780,4.808421052631579

1892918,2,B00009W2GQ,"'The Matrix: Revolutions' is the final installment of the Wachowski brothers' Matrix trilogy which, when viewed on its own merit is a remarkable action movie, but of very poor quality when considered in its proper role as the final episode of this modern epic.  In Revolutions, which is set to take place immediately after the conclusion of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix-Reloaded-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0000AXE8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix Reloaded (Widescreen Edition)</a>, Neo is in an apparent coma, having been imprisoned by a rogue program, somewhere between the Matrix and the computer network that lies outside of it.  Trinity and Morpheus must free Neo from his state of mental imprisonment so that Neo can rescue Zion from the imminent and massive attack from the machines that was only hours away in Reloaded.  Smith, the agent Neo destroyed in The 'Matrix,' continues to gain power so that he begins to not only threaten the Matrix, but Zion and the machine civilization in the real world, as well.  Neo is forced to make a series of important choices in how to best proceed so that evil is defeated, Zion is saved, and humanity is finally freed from its invisible state of bondage.

Written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski, 'Revolutions' unfortunately continues the disappointing trend begun in Reloaded where nicely mixed classical philosophy is blended with the modern world and the role of technology as a storyline, combined with amazing direction, innovative camera techniques, and wonderful coloring, is abandoned in favor of a painfully-lengthy series of very contrived fight scenes and little in the way of plot or philosophy.  While the heavy use of special effects continues in Revolutions, their effect is to only enhance the action portrayed, rather than to help further the plot.  Essentially, what the audience is left with is dependent upon what they expect from this movie.  For those who wanted to see a grand capstone to the saga of Neo  told in the same spirit as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;there is only disappointment, as the Wachowski brothers have once again failed to capture the same energy, innovation, and intellectual appeal present in the original film, instead resorting to a weak plot and lots of special effects.  For those who wanted to see a very good action movie, their expectations will be met, and likely exceeded.  If the inconsistencies in plot, lack of intellectual content, clichd dialog, and disappointing understanding of history (the machine city has its very own Maginot Line that worked so poorly for France during World War II) can be ignored, The Matrix: Revolutions may be enjoyed as nothing more than a remarkable action movie.

If these issues are the antithesis of what appealed to you about The Matrix, do not bother wasting your money to see this film in the theaters; wait for it to be released in video stores.",1196208000,,3075,5.533049040511727
1892919,5,B00009W2GQ,"I know of friends who only saw the first Matrix movie and that is a shame, as all three parts of the trilogy belong together as the journey of Neo and the change that happens to him along the way. It is a fantastic job that has been done in keeping the quality at the top without descending into making B-grade follow up movies as is often the case with sequels.

It is a movie that can be seen on many levels. Some will see it just as a great action movie which it is, but there is so much more to this film. It is a fantastic depiction of the journey of the spiritual seeker and the difficulties that he encounters within himself as he starts pushing against the prisons of his own mind and the multitude of programs that operates and which keep us small.

It also neatly depicts the way humans are kept as 'food for the moon' in Gurdjieff's words or simply food for ultra terrestrials. In the film this is depicted as humans, being little less than cultivated biological batteries for the machines.

The story is part of a trilogy and all three parts are worth watching more than once, as you will undoubtedly see new things each time. Things that start making sense only after some time of reflection and reading. In this regard I can recommend reading the book by Ouspensky called ""In Search of the Miraculous"", and the book by Laura Knight-Jadczyk called ""The Secret History of the World"".",1195344000,5,1395,4.42023346303502

Granted the original Matrix was much better but how much of that was its newness?  My only disappointment was that up to this point in the trilogy, every phenomenon had a scientifically plausible explanation.  That's why it's SCIENCE FICTION.  But when Neo gets to the real world and finds he can control the squiddies, that's no longer science - it's magic - and that's cheating.  It's no longer science fiction but fantasy.  Both are great genres, but you have to stick to one or the other.  Those are the rules.

1892923,4,B00009W2GQ,"""The Matrix: Revolutions"" is the conclusion of the science fiction trilogy that began with ""The Matrix"" and continued with ""The Matrix: Reloaded.""  ""Revolutions"" doesn't really add a lot to the story despite its length and showy special effects; it does put a reasonably satisfying conclusion on the whole epic, which featured some cutting edge special effects for its time.

""Revolutions"" begins where ""Reloaded"" left off, with the last human city of Zion under siege by malevolent machines.  Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus rallies the survivors to buy time for a miracle.  Meanwhile, Neo (Keanu Reeves) works his way through a world equal parts computer language and vaguely Christian symbolism toward a final confrontation with the renegade program Agent Smith.  Neo will be accompanied by Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss) to the location of that final showdown in Machine City.

The movie features lots of long, computer-generated action sequences that will appeal to hardcore fans of the series.  A decisive explanation of the movie and the series may not be apparent from a single viewing of ""Revolutions"", but maybe that is part of the mystery.  Fans who haven't watched the earlier movies may be confused by the plot, and should probably watch the movies in order.  Recommended to fans of the franchise.",1184457600,,1304,5.2009569377990434
1892924,3,B00009W2GQ,"This movie is only moderately entertaining, but what it lacks in its odd pacing and mediocre character development it makes up in intellectual appeal. Upon reflection, it's kind of an odd mix of mass Hollywood appeal and thought-provoking ideas. In this movie, the two elements don't really mesh.

On the one hand, it has the feel of an action movie. Though I'm not much into action movies these days, the action sequences here do exceed most action movies. These sequences are visually and technically stunning, and most of them are filled with new ideas. But aside from their impressiveness, the main pitfall of this movie, and of the whole trilogy, is how it uses action - the action gives the story its texture, but it's simply too conventional. When car-chases or gunfights or karate fights begin, the viewer's mind is intentionally put on pause, and s/he's encouraged to dig into the fight and give into the adrenaline rush. It reminds me of my intense dislike for musicals; even if a musical has a good plot and sound characters, when the music is cued, everything is put on hold for song and dance, when I'm just waiting for things to continue. Likewise, the action sequences here arrest the plot development. They're still entertaining, but in a very short-lived manner. The fighting compares well with every other movie with similar fighting, but it's poorly integrated into the story of The Matrix; and even if it proves groundbreaking, its influence will dissipate as directors one-up these movies by coming up with more exciting ways to have one character chase or demolish another.

The last hour of Revolutions is told in two consecutive unrelenting battles; it results in a long-lived and exciting climax, but it turns the viewer's attention away from the film's plot, and merely towards sigh and relief when the tension stops. And for all it was worth, by the time we reach the end, the plot developments feel minor in comparison.

The ending doesn't quite feel worth it, but it does convey the thought that went into the story's structure. In retrospect, it works very well in theory; it's almost like one of those complicated gun standoffs where more three or so characters are pointing guns at each other in various directions (and in touching every single past convention, the film does contain a brief literal version of this). Only here the characters exist and influence each other on different levels and in different worlds, and they're eventually brought together by similar yet conflicting interests. Moreover, each side pointing guns is made to represent different intertwining ideas. On one level, in order to accomplish this, the movie does occasionally spell things out too clearly to the viewer with pseudo-philosophical rants; but more importantly the characters end up playing out these roles and ""ideas"" - the structure of the story walks the walk so to speak.

To avoid spoiling it I won't give too much away. In and of itself, the end is fairly simple, but what has continued to impress me is how the movie's sequences of events arrived there from a ""perfectly balanced equation"" (which we hear about in The Matrix Reloaded), that pitted two seemingly contrasting ideas on different sides in order to fulfill its purpose. There is an inevitable logic to the ""solution"", which speaks to the trilogy as a whole.

But as I said before, most of this is painted in cheeky Hollywood clothing, complete with Bond-like sarcasm, overuse of stunt-men and CGI-effects, and dispensable characters and side-plots. With a lesser budget and geared towards a smaller adudience, the story could have been told in a tighter and more efficient manner in three or four hours if it had less focus on fighting, and more focus on the characters and the different levels of the story. But not to ruminate on what it could have been, I was glad that the movie challenged me more than most large-scale movies and gave me something pretty to watch at the same time. Hopefully it'll raise the bar for other mainstream flicks, beyond just by giving us new ways to film people shooting each other.",1184025600,2,4105,4.900719424460432
1892925,4,B00009W2GQ,"Conclusion is what Revolutions is, bringing and ended to the explosive Matrix Trilogy.  A direct continuation from Reloaded, Revolutions is once again more eye candy than anything else, with the actual Matrix getting less screen time than the first 2 films.  The focus is on the great war in Zion city, against the machines.  Its true, the best action and story in this movie all take place in the real world.  But there is still plenty of Matrix involved, but only in the beginning and end of the film.

The ending is predictable, but the journey to reach the conclusion has smaller twists and turns along the way that are unexpected.  The movie is very intense, in terms of action and cgi.  It is truly a thrill ride and we finally get to see an army of mechs unleash their firepower upon the sentinels in Zion city.  Neo and Smith face off in their final battle.  Unlike the first Matrix, which incorporated a nice blend of realistic martial arts and wirework, this battle is more cgi and expands to the 2 barely fighting on any ground, thus limiting the true martial arts.  Not a bad fight, but its ridiculously overdone and not very pretty.

Some say this movie is just plain bad, but I don't believe that is true.  Most people want to compare it to the first Matrix, but independently its not a bad movie.  While it is not nearly as good as the first Matrix, it is still a great movie, but just like Reloaded, the story effort is not as strong as the first Matrix, and the focus seems to be on the action.  You'll want to see Reloaded before Revolutions, simply because Reloaded is part 1 and Revolutions is pt2.",1182556800,,1618,4.459183673469388
1892926,3,B00009W2GQ,"Revolutions was not a great climax to the Matrix trilogy. The first was sensational. It was stylistic, original, and thought provoking. The first time I watched it I was captivated the entire time and wanted more. Many people did not think much of Reloaded, but I personally loved it. It was not mind-bending like the first, but that wasn't its purpose. The Matrix asked the questions; Reloaded set the stage for a final resolution. I felt it did so with continued originality and style. The fight sequences were artistic and compelling. I don't know how Matrix fans could not have loved watching the result of Neo realizing the potential of his abilities. I can't help overusing the word, but the movie just overflowed with style. The architect scene was odd, but it had good dialogue and was a pretty fun change of direction.

Revolutions almost completely dropped all of those aspects that I enjoyed about the first two. Instead of original, it was filled with cliche. Most of the Zion battle seemed like it could have been made by cutting and pasting from dozens of war/action films. Other than the visual aspect, there was nothing original about the entire Zion portion of the movie. Amaze some people by how well you can pilot a ship. Can an unlikely character somehow find it in him to overcome all when nearly all hope is lost? I need not mention the overdone yet cliche Neo/Trinity scene. The Merovingian fight scenes were fun but basically a hybrid of the security guard fight from I and the medieval weapons one from II.

On the whole, I liked the culmination of the Neo storyline. The machine city, along with the train station, was one of the few aspects of the film that was original and interesting. On a fairly superficial note, I just did not enjoy the fight scenes with Smith. The stylistic choreography was replaced with two guys flying all over the place. Even more superficially, I always loved Smith's wisea-- lines from the previous films, but we didn't really get any more of those. Again, I thought the concept of the Neo storyline was good. It just felt like it was delivered a little less thoughtfully, almost as though that plot was the last to be worked out before some sort of deadline. The Oracle's eyes were thrown in as being important to get then barely played any part in the story. The Merovingian didn't have anything interesting to add this time around. Generally it just felt like the actual plot of Revolutions was thrown together somewhat hastily.

The movie wasn't terrible, it was just quite mediocre. Visually it had many great moments including the batman bouncers at the coat check, much of the Zion battle, and the Source. However, it mostly lacked originality and didn't fit together that well. As the final act, Revolutions could have been the culmination of an exciting, philosophical, and compelling trilogy. Instead it was just the last movie.",1172534400,,2895,4.786

1892930,5,B00009W2GQ,"The third film finally gives the secret. For one, it is probably slightly better as for the fights because they are more in the air and that makes them look like surreal comic strip fights. The technique is superb and the cameras are sublime. There is not one strange and normally never used shooting angle that is not used at a moment or other in the shooting of these fights. For two, the machines are brilliant. Of course we all think of Aliens because some of the fighting equipment looks a lot like what we had in Aliens. But the beings, the machines, the mechanical fighters are absolutely unique and they look both very elegant like some giant sea creatures Octopuses maybe but with so many more legs. Machinecity is also great with the allusion to these machines not being able to live in the sunshine. Follow my eyes and read my lips. H. G. Wells is not very far with his time-traveller. The will to show schools of them flying or floating through the air makes these creatures more computer animated and governed because they get involved in some pretty heavy mass movement. But that's great. The master machine is given some kind of a human face and voice, why not since machines are born slaves and slaves imitate their masters. But this meeting with the master machine finally leads us to the real meaning of this saga. But before getting to that it is important to speak of the characterization of the main characters : they look human, they are very expressive in their faces and gestures. They do have the face and body language they need to make us believe we are in real danger. But of course, the main point of them all is the meaning the way it comes up. The machines not more than the humans want to go on with the war that is supposed to destroy the human race. It becomes very clear that the matrix was planned and produced by some human minds in order to make human life ever better than what it had ever been by giving all the dirty and heavy work to machines all maintained and locked up in Machineville. This idea is typically western in thinking, even though it is implied that humans being what they are doomsday is possible everyday of the week. It is a rewriting of H.G. Wells' Time Machine. Actual working and producing was the task of an underground race living in darkness. The change is that these producers are here machines and nothing but machines. The human race then can have it easy at enjoying life. That's a change from H.G. Wells again because for him daytime humans had become unable to do anything except enjoy living and being hunted by the underground species like wild animals or rather submissive cattle. What went wrong is that a special species of men have taken over the control of both human and machine worlds for their own interest and somewhere pleasure. They have highjacket the computer program that is behind the Matrix. The fight then takes place between Neil, aka Mr Andersen, and Agent Smith. Agent Smith has the power to clone himself into any other human being. So he has become an army and he controls the world and he has decided to get rid of the human race. Against him an Oracle, a black human woman who knows more or less what is going to happen, and Neil who has special powers too and can stop Agent Smith, but no more than stop. So he has to trap him into a common ending, a common death because he has to destroy himself if he wants to destroy the fascist. The rest is for you to discover. Very effective. So the world can survive for an unspecified period of time. Peace has been concluded through this final sacrifice. Here we have some good old Christian allusions. First of all the long cassock looking robes he is wearing, our Neil. Second his sacrifice for the survival of humanity. But there will be no resurrection, no rebirth of the world because his girl friend dies before him. No Mary Madgalene secret. And then there will be no surviving procreating couple to reinvent humanity. Humanity has been saved for a while. No Apocalypse. But a victory in the war against the machine like in Frank Herbert, but the machines are not destroyed, the equilibrium of this mechanized world is not changed, there is no promise of a saviour one day. The Christian allusion is thus reduced to a dire minimum. The meaning is also reduced to a dire minimum : for humanity to go on enjoying life we have to get rid of all machines, productive work and pollution far away from us and we have to have a few courageous and inspired warriors that are ready to sacrifice their lives for humanity to go on living. In other words good old traditional patriotic courage. That does not make this trilogy the piece of imagination that will revolutionize the world, but it is an entertaining film. And if you really get into it try to identify all the allusions to Stephen King's novels. I can tell you there are many.

""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" seemed to spend more time building on all the obscure religious references than actually continuing where the first film left off.

What saddens me the most, in watching these two films, you walk away asking yourself where the budget went?  They had millions and millions of dollars, and other than the highway scene and the sentinel attack scene - I can't think of any other significant scenes that would cost a lot to produce - where did all that money go?

1892933,5,B00009W2GQ,"I sort of shook my head as I read some of the reviews of the conclusion of the series.

I had read early after the first movie that the W brothers intended all along to have 3 levels to the saga.  The action part of it was to appeal to a certain segment of the movie public.  Matrix 1 certainly captured the attention of the game playing segment of the population but there was an undercurrent to all the movies that wasn't about the special effects.

I was so surprised that more people didn't catch the King Author references in the movie.  There were so many but particularly the ending when the ""boat"" took the dying king to Avalon.

The shinning promise of Camelot was no more but the world was left with the hope that should Arthur  be needed for the final battle that he would return .

The other element was that in the end it wasn't the war that mattered.  It was what Neo was willing to give that mattered.  That in the end that Neo made it possible that those who came after would be able to enjoy another sunrise.

That all of us have the potential to be the one.  I think a lot of people wanted to feel the the hero kicked butt and won and came back the conquering hero.

But real life isn't like that.  In this country during this particular time we have come through a period where we have glorified war and claimed the heroes were the ones willing to fight for glory and gore.  The reality is that many of them come back in body bags and a lot come back as amputees--  Their real fight just beginning.  Now they have to find a reason for a future after they have given everything they had.  They were heroes when they left for war and every one applauded them for going but very few people want to look at them when they come back in pieces.

Neo gave everything he had and lost everything he cared except his belief that there should be a future.  I left the movie feeling inspired and wanting to rise to the potential  of being ""the One"".

1892936,3,B00009W2GQ,"This likely superfluous review (I say ""superfluous"" as most people have likely already made up their mind about this highly unusual trilogy) has been a long time coming.  I wanted to be sure how I felt about the movie before commenting on it for others.  I enjoyed the original Matrix film but I never saw what all the hype was about.  Underneath the wire-fu and the intro philosophy was, I thought, a fairly typical Hollywood action extravaganza disguised by a stylish pair of sunglasses and nifty visual effects.  Good but, seriously, what's the hype about?

To me, the sequels changed that.  For one thing, different types of philosophy are explored and surprisingly few plot points are every fully resolved.  I don't mean that they're not concluded, just that the Wachowski's don't sit the viewer down and didactically explain why Neo was deleted along with Agent Smith, the machine god couldn't have done that sooner, etc.  Basically you have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself.

Let's face it, most people (even the cinematic elite) are most comfortable with Hollywood-style storytelling.  So an sci-fi/action trilogy that shows a centuries-long war ending by having the pseudo-Christ figure hero sue for peace rather than a James Bond-style ending where the bad guys die and their hideout is destroyed will doubtlessly disappoint some people.  Frankly, it's hard to hold that against them considering the rather formulaic, albeit legendary, first movie.

I was rather ambivalent about the Matrix before the sequels.  After the sequels, I'm still not a rabid fan but I really REALLY like the franchise a lot more for it's intellectual honesty and original storytelling.

I do miss old school bullet time though (last seen in the original Matrix).  It seems like the newer bullet time effects we see in the sequels is basically glorified slow motion most of the time.

And guys?  If people don't like the sequels, it's not really a matter of them ""not getting it"", but they probably just have different expectations from film as entertainment.",1158105600,3,2055,5.014749262536873
1892937,2,B00009W2GQ,"I see no real point in jumping on the whole Matrix-sequels-bashing bandwagon, per se. Sure, it would be oh, so easy to do so, however, I feel that the sequels themselves do a far better job of cannabilising themselves without needing my help.

Instead, I have chosen to limit my review to one aspect of REVOLUTIONS which I feel completely undermines the entirety of the (so-called) trilogy. Namely, the death of Trinity.

Sure, tragedy makes for great drama and what can be more tragic than the death of a main character? However, keeping in mind that the Wachowskis emphasised that RELOADED & REVOLUTIONS were in fact a single story/script that they chose to cut into two (Which in itself begs the question, does that mean there's still one remaining Matrix film left to be made? MATRIX RESUSCITATED, perhaps?), well, in killing off Trinity, the Wachowskis made damn sure that the whole dramatic thrust of RELOADED - namely, Neo dreaming of Trinity's demise and trying to prevent it from happening was really just a pointless exercise in wasting the audiences sweet time. And you can read into Trinity's (and Neo's for that matter) demise as much hidden meaning as you like. It still ranks as stupid! Which, ultimately, is all that the Matrix films really are. No amount of faux philosophical rambling (it's called HYPE, people!) can ever disguise the truth (or is that Truth?) - namely, if it smells like, looks like, feels like a turd, you don't have to swallow any coloured pill to make up your mind that it is, in fact, a TURD. You have all been warned. Oh, and steer well clear of chat-rooms inhabitted by sleazes signing on as Morpheus. There ARE laws against that kind of behaviour, you know!

Oh, and if you ever feel like watching films that are the real deal (ie: intellectually stimulating and mind bending) I recommend VIDEODROME and EXISTENZ, both great films from David Cronenberg.",1155513600,3,1896,4.809815950920245

1892939,3,B00009W2GQ,"The biggest mistake the Wachowski brothers made with The Matrix Revolutions was assuming the audience had emotionally latched onto the characters after the first two films, when in fact they had not. True Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are interesting, but the heart of Matrix fandom lies with the intricate philosphical constructs the films created. Matrix Reloaded had philosphical elements, which kept audience interest despite the film's weak plot line. Revolutions, on the other hand, is a pure sci-fi action flick. It asks us to care about the supporting characters in Zion, when we really don't know them that well. As a result the film is a visual feast of impressive special effects, but it feels very empty in the middle.

What also hurt is that Revolutions splits up the lead characters, with Morpheus given little to do than play co-pilot for the finale. Potentially interesting characters like Persephone and the Merovingian disappear early on in the first act. And Agent Smith becomes the end boss for the movie because movies like these need end bosses.

There are two dvd editions available; this 2-disc set, and a huge Matrix collection that contains all the films and bucketloads of bonus material. The bonus material on this set is already pretty decent. If you're not a huge fan but still want to own the movies, this set will fit your collection well.

I was surprised that this movie is actually a little worse than the one before it. To me their wasn't even much fighting in this movie. To me there was just guys in robot suits, screaming, shooting aimlessly upwards. When watching the two sequeals to the Matrix we forget how great a movie the first one was. It was groundbreaking and very entertaining. Somehow the sequels turned into something that belongs on the Sci Fi channel and not on the big screen. The two sequeals contained nothing but cheap acting that was overdramatic and it seemed like everyone was trying to hard. Some parts of these sequals I thought I was watching Star Trek. After watching these sequals i think it is better if we pretend that these were never created or were not realated in any way to the first Matrix.

This movie is horrible.  The acting is enough to convince me that I should pack all my things and head to Hollywood straight away. No talent required apparently. It makes me scream for the days of excellent and bogus coming out of Reeves mouth.

Matrix 3 oozes cheese in a way that would make Ed Wood's Plan Nine seem like Citizen Kane by comparison.  Revolutions insults the viewers intelligence in ways that make the skin crawl.  For example,  how many times could it explain why they couldn't get the original actress whom played the oracle back? Changed cells?  I think I counted three at least.  I found myself screaming at the T.V.  ""OKAY!!!!  I GET IT!!!!"".

A prime example of a Movie turning into a product that takes itself way too seriously,  the third Matix film will forever in my mind be a horrible horrible thing.  Unless you are having some friends over and want something to rag on for a while, avoid avoid avoid.

As the resistance makes a last gallant stand against the mechanized onslaught, Neo attempts a perilous journey to the City of Machines in an effort to stop the violence once and for all.

While the special effects continued to soar to higher and more complex levels of accomplishment, the dialogue clearly shows signs of weakness, lacking the terse, polished syntax of the first two films. However having said that it is still a worthy conclusion to the Neo saga.

The films are open to polysemic interpretations, and that is what makes the Matrix trilogy and philosophy so beautiful. The Matrix Reloaded improved on the original in many ways, and this film improves on them both.

We take a step up in many new camera techniques, and we have a few technological advances from the first film. The bullet time technique had revoloutionised cinema, and the way films are made. It also was ridiculed from film to film, with even Dreamworks' Shrek getting in on the act.

If you thought the first two films were complex, then this film will confuse you like nothing before. We may not have the psycho analysing architect to contend with, but we have a plot that seems to move in ways that we do not expect, yet think it should. Questions we thought would be answered, are left for us to amuse ourselves with.

If you like closure and boundaries, then this film might not be the one for you. If you like action, gloriously choreographed fight sequences and the confusion of the what ifs, then you will love this film. Loose ends are not tied, and is peace closure. Is it really peace at all? Were you really watching this film and are you really reading this review...

To sum it up the acting may be slightly wooden, and the love between Neo and Trinity does not really makes us feel very passionate. The dialogue in places appears over written and very Capraesque, but who cares? The Matrix is clever, and inspiring. I love it",1149811200,,1736,4.533546325878595

Most americain movies have the good guy win and live but when people came out of revolutions they felt betrayed

because of that type of ending where nothing was really resolved and everything bascially ended up in a draw as far as the movies go and you end up at square one wondering what the hell went wrong with this idea!!!. Very bad way of storytelling if you ask me.

Smith was destroyed by Neo and basically it felt like Smith was a Virus in the matrix and Neo ended up being the Anti virus

and cleaned out smith out of the matrix and that was it.

The humans are still there the machines are still there and that is it.

The problem is that the machine side of the story is not explored enough in the movie and in the end it is confusing

because it is that big machine world that neo is going against and it feels like the machine world is using Neo to eliminate

a direct threat to them in the person of agent smith.

Yes there is other derivative products that help understand but even after looking at them and the movies you are left with a sour taste of ""THAT""S IT?!!!!""  "" I have just wasted that much time looking at these things to be left with that type of ending?!!!""

A lot of people are trying to make philosophy and even religion out of these movies and the way they went but there is not much to make out of it and yet so much speculation is going on because of the ending of revolutions...

The Warchowski Brothers took that oriental style of ending path and they have to deal with it. What Became an obsession for many is being ridiculed by as many more because all the endings or story enhancments for the movies or in follow up derivatives stuff is getting worse and worse.

The brothers have not really come full circle with this and they should...

Another trilogy? maybe...to fix things...or to make it even worse?.

Who knows..i would like an amercain type of ending to this mess so that i can go on with this and stop wondering at what might have happened after revolutions...

A great letdown for many... on another note a good coming full circle example was the Star Wars prequel, some say they are bad but at least the 3rd movie gave us a clear picture of what really happened and that part of the story was closed well and most people did not grumble over it...and that is the way the matrix series should have been done...

1892945,5,B00009W2GQ,"The original Matrix very nearly defined a whole new visual style in moviemaking. Its successor, Reloaded, seemed perfunctory after that - the same again, with the volume turned up. This third Matrix rises nearly to the level of the first Matrix's novelty.

Novelty, by definition, can't be a repetition. This time, it comes from a pervasive combination of live action with computer animation. The animation is outstanding - hugely complex scenes, with hundreds or thousands of separate robotic characters. The dim-lit, robotic cityscapes create a grim sense of scale and majesty. Best, though, was what the director chose not to animate, the human figures. Animation can't yet produce the subtlety and expression of human actors, so no attempt was made to synthesize them. Instead, elaborate compositing combined real actors with computer-graphic sets and props. It's the best, and certainly the most complex example to date of the merged techniques. Enjoyable extras on the second disk show how the actors played their parts in this movie - showing that acting is a whole different craft than it used to be.

This is a definite end to the Matrix franchise, a satisfying resolution of the basic conflict that's driven the series. I guess there's still room for prequels and such. Any sequels would have to have such different premises from this trilogy that they'd hardly be recognizable. I'm very glad to see the series end on such a high note.

Some discount this because they were movies, and not works of literature or music or ""traditional"" art (i.e. painting, sculpture, etc.).  Others discount this claim because the trilogy was science fiction and not drama.

Yet I claim that the Matrix Trilogy should be held alongside the works of Shakespeare and DaVinci and Michelangelo!  The Matrix Trilogy contains all the best of the literary, the musical, the visual, the comedy, the tragedy, the mystery, and the anything-else-you-want-to-include-here.

For those who didn't ""get"" the last two films, I am sorry to inform you that you simply should have stayed awake in your philosophy and comparative relgion classes in college.  In this masterpiece you have the distilled philosophical wisdom of Descartes, Nietzsche, Baudrillard, Schoepenhoer, Plato, and many others along with the religious insights found in Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity.

The Matrix Trilogy could be watched a THOUSAND TIMES and would still reveal more truths and mysteries with each successive viewing.

My answer to those who try and compare the first film to the last two would be two-fold:  First, view the Trilogy as a WHOLE, and not as three separate films.  Only then will you realize that the answers to questions posed in the first film were not answered there, but rather, in the two subsequent films.  Second, if you are not up on your philosophy (shame on you for getting that USELESS and BOURGEOIS business degree), then go out and buy one of the three main books EXPLAINING the many meanings of the films (""The Matrix and Philosophy"", ""More Matrix and Philosophy"", ""Taking the Red Pill"", etc.)

1892953,3,B00009W2GQ,"""The Matrix"" burst on the scene with mind-boggling special effects and a witty reality-versus-perception theme that justified those amazing special effects.  A top-notch cast worked with a script that had just enough spirituality associated wtih it that viewers didn't consider ""The Matrix"" just another dumb action movie.  At the end, the possibilities of ""The Matrix"" seemed limitless -- and the conjectures regarding where this storyline could lead were almost as entertaining as the movie itself.

Unfortunately, the sequels bogged down, both in the attempt to top the action scenes of the original, and by the simple truth that by advancing the storyline, the sequels eliminated our ability to speculate where ""The Matrix"" was headed.  Just like ""The Blair Witch Project"" was so scary because we didn't really know or see what was going on, the possibilities of Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity battling against Agent Smith and the machines were more exciting in their unknown state than they could ever be in an actual story.

The creative forces behind ""The Matrix"" cannot be accused of failing to delve deeper into the storyline.  By the time ""The Matrix Revolutions"" came around, we had gone so far beyond the first movie as to make it almost unrecognizable.  Indeed, I had a hard time even figuring out who the villains of ""Revolutions"" are -- is Neo most concerned about the machines, or the Merovingian, or the Trainman, or the assassin going after him in Zion . . . and what the hell is Agent Smith doing anyway?  And what about the Architect?  Just who is the Oracle, anyway?

I'm sure there are those who have explored every website, fan fiction storyline, and utterance of those who created the Matrix mythology who understand this complicated storyline.  But I merely watched the movies, and I really couldn't make heads or tails of the story after a while.

Fortunately, ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is one of the most enjoyable movies to watch I have ever seen (based on purely visual terms).  The machines eventually breach the human stronghold of Zion, and what unfolds is a battle of machine versus man (who, to be fair, uses machines) that astounds the eye and also strikes a few notes of pathos.  We see sacrifice and heroism in the face of overwhelming odds, and while we may not entirely understand what that sacrifice is for in precise terms, it is clear that these people are sacrificing their own lives for the greater humanity.  And that is enough.

After the climax of this battle, Neo and Agent Smith have their much-ballyhooed mano-y-machino fisticuffs.  Please don't ask me to explain why this is the climactic fight, or even who really wins, but the visuals are undeniably amazing.

The movie ends on an optimistic yet ambiguous note . . . will the War between man and machine continue?  Well, the problem is that since we're dealing with a storyline about futuristic computers and perception-versus-reality, there is nothing stopping the creators of ""The Matrix"" to spit out innumerable sequels that continually reexamine the same illogical themes.

Well, the only speedbump is probably movie studio finances.  It's a troubling trilogy that concludes with a sense of, ""We'll be right back here, provided the accountants can do a favorable cost-benefit analysis.""

""The Matrix Revolutions"" ultimately goes out with a whimper rather than a bang . . . a spectacular, dizzying whimper, to be sure, but a whimper nevertheless.",1133740800,4,3447,5.010526315789473

1892955,4,B00009W2GQ,"After the two previous films there's not a lot of need to rehash another description of the plot or the characters.  After watching this it's easy to see that the seams dividing the three films are primarily there to provide logical breaks between the movies, not because they are needed.  This is really one very long film and several of the themes only come to fruition here.  It is time for the rebels to hunker down for the last defense of Zion and for Neo to quest for a solution that doesn't involve ending life entirely.

Simple things first.  This film is a masterpiece of CGI, choreography, and stagecraft.  Not simply because there are a lot of detailed evil critters running around waving tentacles, but because the animators have taken great care to make sure that the critters work together flawlessly.  Battle scenes such as the defense of Zion are remarkable because of their vastness and the cruel beauty of the conflict.  And the fight work, especially the final grand conflict between Neo and Smith is equally compelling.  In the previous episode, I found the fighting a bit repetitious, but here everything is so under control that it appears effortless and natural.

Another thing the Wachowski's do very well here is shift between realities so well that by the end one isn't quite sure which events are happening in what layer of perception.  Our only hints are when Neo starts talking to Trinity about The Light.  This affirms there is something beneath the surface, even if we aren't sure what it is.  It isn't really the machines on the other side of this struggle, it's Agent Smith who has become Neo's alter ego as bringer of the dark.  All of this forces the viewer to accept everything as real, which is exactly the right state for viewing.

One of the layers of symbolism I found lurking in this film, unlike the pseudo-symbolism built up by the choices of names, is the steady, low-key series of Arthurian references.  Much like the story of the Once and Future King this the story of hope broken and then rebuilt on the bones of failure and tragedy.  It isn't until the ending sequences that Wachowski's take their gloves of and hit you over the head with Arthur/Neo, but it works quite well in context.

Obviously I liked this film much better than Matrix Reloaded.  I'm not going to pretend that the film is a literary masterpiece, but it does a great job of demonstrating that action/adventure can be a lot more than brain numbing hack, kick, and slash.

1892959,3,B00009W2GQ,"We know from our indoctrination into the philosophy of the Matrix movies that there are two worlds: one is the waking dream that is the ""Matrix"", a world generated by the Machines to keep us shackled in illusion while we're used as living batteries. Tne second world is that of the Desert of the Real: you have no job. You have no cubicle. You have no rent-controlled apartment with a nosy landlord.

Everything you see before you, all the ""evidence"" of your senses, is an ambitious fraud: you are kept in a cocoon, envatted in a snare of pink fluid and dreams, convinced you live and walk and talk and breathe the air of a free man in a free society.

In other words: the Real, and the Illusory. The Wachowski Brothers have made a great flick technically (ie: the realm of the illusory): they have stormed the ramparts of what great cinema should look like, and---who knows?---stormed the ramparts of how movies should be made.

They have also churned out a flick that betrays the rich ideas of the first film. In the same spirit, and because it is unfair to ""Matrix Revolutions"" to judge it according to either its technical flair or its philosophical limitations, I shall provide a rare dual review, also in keeping with the dual realities of the Matrix.

MATRIX REVIEW(The World of Illusion): 5 stars out of 5. My God this movie looks great! This flick cost 150 million smackers to make, and every penny---every red cent---of that budget is up on the screen! Look at the dual, perhaps triplicate, realities the Wachowskis have conjured up: the slick, techno, ephemeral, ghost-green world of the Matrix, green-hued, lorded over by the fast-talking Merovingian, the consummate Rabbit hole-within-Rabbit-hole. So gorgeous it makes you wish you'd taken the Blue Pill. Maybe there's still time?

Anyway, the flick looks amazing. Even if you're disgusted with it, pop it back into the hopper, and look at the thing! Look at the ropy steel-and-red-burning-laser-eye contraptions of the Sentinels, or the gigantic drill that burrows through the rooftop to Zion and then plummets to the floor of the cavern below! This is simply one of the greatest, most hyper-kinetic action flicks ever filmed; the fear in the Great Hall when the battle mechas confront the swarming sentinel reeks of war and sweat and death and fear. I love it!

Classic. The fight between Neo and Agent Smith (the great Hugo Weaving in his generation-defining, massively quoted role) is one for the ages: the rain, the generic cityscape, the rows and rows and rows of Agent Smiths watching from the streets, from the windows of the otherwise vacant office buildings. Brrrr.

ZION REVIEW(The Desert of the Real): 1 out of 5 Stars. Blah! Desert of the Real is right: great characters from ""The Matrix"" go through the motions: Neo (Keanu Reeves)sleepwalks through his role, Morpheus (Larry Fishburne) looks like he's about ready to call out for a pizza---someone should have budgeted for Fishburne a personal trainer, or at the least put the big guy on the Atkins diet.

Trinity (the nimble Carrie Anne Moss) provides earnest eye candy. Neo (Keanu Reeves) does his Neo-thang. Nothing is resolved. Heretical yet intriguing theories provoked by ""Matrix Reloaded"" (the ""Matrix-within-a-Matrix"" theory suggested by Neo's ability to stop the sentinels in the ""real"" world) are nodded to and then ignored. Yes, the trailer promised us great things---""It all ends tonight""---but we get zero delivery. The huge questions---does any of this matter? Is Zion Real?---are ignored.

Alright. Real World: 1 Star. Matrix World: (all the CGI goodies and cinematic wizardry): 5 Stars. Listen to Hugo Weaving's dialogue; Weaving, as Agent Smith/Bane, completely owns this movie and gives it its black wicked heart. Bully to him! Sample the raw sheer audacious techno style of the Merovingian (the incomparable Lambert Wilson), who found French to be the superlative language of the Insult.

Ogle Monica Belluci (the luscious Persephone), who just looks ripe. Wonder how Harvard law prof and Ivy League resident crackpot ever bribed the Wachowskis to be in this movie. Just don't expect any answers, deep meaning, or conclusions. What, you thought you'd find the meaning of Life in a blockbuster flick? Sheesh.

It's stylish, it's wicked black, it bumps and grinds, it's pretty cool. Ultimately it answers none of the questions. Do you care? Take the Blue Pill! Take the Red Pill! You'll find that with ""Matrix Revolutions"" it makes no difference.

1892963,3,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions represents a disappointing way for the science fiction trilogy to bow out. Overlong and underwhelming, The Matrix Revolutions reinforces the thinking that it's a rare movie series in which the final chapter is the strongest. In this installment, the intelligence and ideas that formed one of the cornerstones of the original The Matrix, and were still in evidence in The Matrix Reloaded, have been shunted aside in favor of computer-generated action that makes about 1/3 of this movie look like a video game on the big screen.

The problems with the film are easy enough to pinpoint. It's pretentious (this was true, at least to a degree, of its predecessors) - we're expected to approach this film with the same solemnity that the Wachowski Brothers do. The action is hackneyed - the slo-mo martial arts stuff was neat the first time, but it was already getting old by the time it was re-used in The Matrix Reloaded. Now, it's past the expiration date, and the Wachowskis fail to come up with anything genuinely new or innovative to enhance or improve upon it. The pacing is uneven - the first hour is bogged down with talking and unnecessary exposition; not until the half-way point does the energy level shoot up. And the payoff is weak. Had this been a stand-alone popcorn science fiction adventure, it might have been enjoyable, but this is a poor way to end a trilogy. Expectations built up by the first two films are not fulfilled. One could be forgiven for anticipating something more momentous than a long shoot-'em-up followed by a glorified fistfight. And the ""twist,"" if it can be called that, is hardly earthshaking.

The Matrix Revolutions begins where The Matrix Reloaded ended - with Neo (Keanu Reeves) in a coma after defeating a few sentinels. Actually, his mind is stuck in a sort of limbo (that looks like a train station) between the Matrix and the Real World. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) go in after him, and are forced to make a deal with the annoyingly cultured Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) to retrieve him. Meanwhile, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), has found a way to escape from the Matrix in his unending quest to eliminate Neo. The machines are about to finish off Zion, and Lock (Harry J. Lennix) is running out of options. Morpheus, Link (Harold Perrineau Jr.), and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) decide to return to the human city, but Neo and Trinity believe their destiny lies elsewhere. So, with the fate of mankind riding on their shoulders, they head in an unexpected direction.

In recent years, the line between special effects-focused blockbusters and computer games has been shrinking, and The Matrix Revolutions further narrows the gap. All that's missing is a joystick on the theater seat arm rest. The battle for Zion should be tense and suspenseful, but the obviousness of the computer generated animation during these sequences damages the ability to suspend disbelief. I didn't ever believe that I was watching humanity's last stand. Instead, I felt like I was watching a non-playable demo for a Matrix Revolutions videogame - shoot down as many sentinels as possible before being overwhelmed. The human element is limited to a few familiar faces rather than legitimate characters we actually care about.

After playing Superman for the last movie, Neo is back to being merely mortal this time around. That makes for some degree of uncertainty about his fate, but, unfortunately, it also requires that Keanu Reeves attempt to do more than stand around looking bemused and cool in black. The Matrix Revolutions expects Reeves to act a little, but the moment he tries to show emotion, we have to fight back giggles. Sadly, Reeves isn't the only one to display acting deficiencies. His co-stars, Carrie-Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne, are on auto-pilot. Moss tries (and fails) to make us believe that Trinty truly, madly, deeply loves Neo. Fishburne had little to do except look stern. The only ones with any real energy are Harold Perrineau Jr. and Jada Pinkett Smith, neither of whom has a lot of screen time. The gorgeous Monica Bellucci (as Persephone) is so underused that it's inappropriate to label her appearance as anything more than a cameo, with her cleavage getting most of the attention. There has been one casting change: the enigmatic Oracle is now played by Mary Alice, replacing Gloria Foster, who died during production of The Matrix Reloaded.

When The Matrix Revolutions works, it does so as eye candy. Although the first hour drags because of the pontificating about choice and fate (none of the speeches offer anything new), the second hour zips by. The battle sequences may not be as involving as those in, say, Star Wars, but they are done with enough technical savvy to retain the attention of most viewers. And those who are on hand just to see a big-budget special effects extravaganza will be satisfied. Anyone hoping to experience the blend of science fiction, philosophy, and edgy action that characterized the previous two movies will be disappointed. Nevertheless, for completists who need to find out how it ends, The Matrix Revolutions provides answers (although not necessarily to all questions) and doesn't cop out when it comes to the final resolution.",1121040000,7,5281,4.976217440543602
1892964,3,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions is a tough movie to score. First you have the greatness of the first two films to take into acount. If you judge the movie as an individual film, it is by all means great. The acting was great, visuals were awesome, and the direction was at its best. I do not consider myself a stupid person, and am not stupid. I have legitimate reasons to dislike this movie. While it is supposedly great because of it symbolism, that is not what the Matrix trilogy is trying to achieve. It is not a religion, it is a set of three films. Taking the first two films into acount, the third is pretty bad. While Revolutions answers many questions, it does not answer those from the previous films. Revolutions is more of a Matrix supplement than a real ending. Sure Zion is save, Smith is destroyed, and peace is achieved, but all the build up from the first two movies is lost. It is as if they made this movie to some two prequels that I've never seen. This film departs from the Matrix roots, and stumbles because of it. While in the first two films most of the dialogue was in riddles, this film makes up totally new riddles to answer. Take the general idea of this movie and separate it from the trilogy to get a great movie, but stick it into the Matrix, and it becomes strangely out of place. They should have done better to conclude the trilogy, but since I have no power to change this I shall have to be satisfied with it.

1892966,3,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix started off a trilogy that could have and should have been awesome. The original was a classic and shall always be remembered. It's a one of a kind movie. On the other hand, the sequel lost me at certain plot points and had some unnecessary and boring parts but the compelling and absolutely awesome fighting scenes and ""the chase"" make it a very solid and good movie. And then, we go to the Matrix Revolutions. I was really excited to see the last installment of this trilogy but I was very dissapointed at the end.

First off, I don't understand why certain characters are introduced and then that's it. They just dissapear. The frenchman reappeared in this one, but nothing really happened with him. The trainmaster was introduced and fought Neo and then he just dissapeared. The movie does have one awesome scene where the sentinels fight humans and giant robots that they pilot with big guns, miniguns, and rocket launchers. But, this scene did seem to last forever, a little too long than it should have. But, it still was very neat and awesome. And then, there's the ending which was a letdown to me. I won't go into details but this movie was even more of a letdown because the awesome precedessors were ended by a strange, and dissapointed conclusion. If you're a big fan, or just want to watch the REALLY LONG BATTLE SCENE, it's worth a buy, or else, buy the original which is a good movie while the sequels only have really cool and neat moments but are boring and confusing. The Matrix Reloaded is better than this one though because it has way more cool and awesome scenes. Well, there it is, my views on the final installment of a trilogy.",1119657600,,1664,4.565217391304348
1892967,3,B00009W2GQ,"It's hard to believe The Matrix Revolutions is a conclusion to the 1999 film, The Matrix.  What began as a ground-breaking epic four years prior ends with a subpar action flick, discarding many of the elements that made the original the smart, slick film it's still regarded as today.

The first major problem with Revolutions is that it's NOT A DIRECT SEQUEL TO RELOADED.  It isn't!  The Wachowski Brothers apparently decided that their game, Enter the Matrix, should serve as a link between the two films, so there are a few things going on at the beginning of Revolutions that seem to follow Reloaded, but make no sense if you didn't play the game.  This is a clever marketing ploy, but as far as delivering the story, it's not very smart; fortunately, it isn't TOO important to what's going on, so the questions will end long before the movie takes off.

I've watched a lot of films with action sequences so intense I wish they'd never end.  The Matrix Revolutions seems to be trying to fulfill that wish here, except it's not done very well.  The epic battle with the sentinels over Zion is very, VERY intense, but it goes on so long and without interruption you may find yourself looking at your watch, wondering when the actual story's going to come back.  And when it does...well, sometimes you get the feeling you know why they spent more time on the battle sequences.

In short, the end result is a film that's so cliche, choppy, and overblown that you feel they placed most of the focus on special effects, which are impressive, but nothing extraordinary.  Purists will probably wish this film never existed; at the very least, it's an intense action flick that ""wraps up"" the conflict presented in the original.",1115769600,6,1723,4.691029900332226
1892968,4,B00009W2GQ,"""The Matrix Revolutions"", the 3rd and final movie in the trilogy:  I was very disappointed by the ending and felt betrayed - I didn't think they gave us a worthy ending to this trilogy.  But again, I gave it a good rating because of the action and special effects and also because I know that most people won't watch the 2nd or 3rd movie of the Matrix trilogy without watching and liking the 1st movie, (The Matrix).  In other words, if you didn't like ""The Matrix"", you sure as heck aren't going to like the 2nd or 3rd movie.  But if you liked ""The Matrix"", you may like the sequels but have mixed feelings about them like I did.  Also, the acting in ""The Matrix Revolutions"" wasn't very good.  The actors seemed wooden, stiff and robotic, almost like they were machines instead of humans.

I have to admit that if I had seen these 2 sequels, I would not have bought the DVDs.  I bought them without seeing the movies first.  I never regretted buying ""The Matrix"" because it is an outstanding film and can be watched on its own.

I haven't listened to the commentary track on any of the DVDs yet - Maybe it will help with some of my questions.  But there is nothing that anybody can say to fix the ending of the last movie, ""The Matrix Revolutions"".  I don't get it.  What happened to Neo?  It just didn't make any sense.  :-(

That is just absurd. And instead of flying around, he could have simply popped in at a different location like the agents do.

The other thing I didn't like was the move away from the sharp camera angles. The first movie felt like a comic book with really high angles showing the rain fall, etc. The 2nd and 3rd degenerated into a flat faux goth feel. The messianic theme seemed to disappear as well.",1113868800,6,575,4.275229357798165

1892981,3,B00009W2GQ,"Could have been better.  Revolutions was really ""Reloaded Part 2"" and continued on with pretty much the same theme as the second film.

One of the more surprising things about this film is that it attempted to resolve some of the issues that were raised in Reloaded (The true identity of Bane, Neo's real purpose etc ) and integrate such issues into a finale.  The philosophical issues of free will and fate came to a head in this film and we ultimately see what Neo has to ""sacrifice"" for the good of all.

As to the visuals, we are treated to a stunning  display of CGI with the invasion of the sentinels but little in the way of actual footage in the matrix itself.  It seems that Zion was the focus here and as such, most of the film takes place in this environment (the ""Real world"").  Overall this isn't a bad thing yet the inhabitants of this realm all look a bit jaded and depressed (lack of sunglight ?) and what's with them all being black ???

Not a bad finish to a great trilogy.  Matrix 1 though still stands alone as one of the great Sci-Fi films.",1111795200,3,1061,4.291457286432161
1892982,4,B00009W2GQ,"Let me tell you, I was in a grand funk after suffering through ""The Matrix: Reloaded."" I couldn't believe the Wachowski brothers took such a great idea and turned it into a lead balloon. The first Matrix entry was an ultraslick, hyperkinetic actioner that had me teetering on the edge of my seat for nearly its entire runtime. Everything clicked in ""The Matrix,"" from the intriguing and well-developed characters to the underlying story to the shock and awe special effects. The film even managed to use the action scenes sparingly so as not to overshadow the other elements, something science fiction and thrillers rarely accomplish. Then came ""Reloaded,"" and the gleaming gold of ""The Matrix"" rapidly turned into rusty iron. Turgid dialogue larded with enough philosophical mumbo jumbo to confound Plato reared its ugly head in nearly every scene. Lord Larry Fishburne, we quickly notice, is turning into this generation's Marlon Brando if the weight gain is any indication. And then there's the action sequences ramped up to insanely high levels. It's like the Wachowskis tried to outdo their own creation and instead created a film that should have bolts in its neck and green paint splashed on its face.

It was with some trepidation that I hit the play button on ""Revolutions.""  I quickly realized I shouldn't have worried. While the film still boasts enough muttered hokum to make your eyes spin around in your head, it is actually quite suspenseful and entertaining. Even professional boat anchor Keanu Reeves can't completely sink this effort. We come into ""Revolutions"" with the impending attack of the machines on Zion looming like a dark cloud on the horizon. Neo's in trouble again, of course, and is trapped in some subway station between the world and the matrix. Fortunately, he has a cute Indian family and some sinister chap named the Trainman (Bruce Spence) to keep him company. Obviously he won't stay there long thanks to his buddies Trinity and Morpheus, who kick some serious you know what to get their boy back in the game. It's nice to see the sleek and sexy Carrie-Anne Moss return to her character's roots, that of a hard charging warrior who just happens to look great in black leather, even if it lasts for only a few minutes. Needless to say they manage to spring Neo from his subway platform prison, and not a moment to soon: Zion is gearing up to fend off the machines and they are going to need, as Tom Berenger's character in Platoon so nobly opined, ""Every swinging d! ck out in the field.""

What follows when the machines punch through the domed ceiling of the city is my favorite part of the film. It's mindless action here, folks, as the CGI effects fly fast and furious. The defenders in the city climb into these giant robotic machines armed to the teeth with massive machine guns and await the attack. Zion doesn't wait long. Giant drills punch humongous holes in the ceiling, followed by trillions of those familiar probes from the first film. Every citizen lends a hand, especially the women. They run around in the pipes and ductwork armed with homemade rocket launchers picking off the sentinels. Meanwhile, Morpheus and Niobe race back to Zion in their ship in a desperate attempt to save the faltering city. Neo and Trinity accept a more difficult mission: flying one of the ships to Machine City in order to strike a most unusual deal. To say anymore about this top secret and desperate mission would spoil the surprise for the two people in the world who haven't seen the film yet. I can say that it involves yet another battle between the Smith clones and Neo. This time around, however, the effects in the showdown look much better than the laughable burly fight in ""Reloaded."" I cried at the film's conclusion--not because of anything that happened onscreen but because I realized Keanu Reeves would probably continue making movies.

Seriously though, ""Revolutions"" was an all around better effort than the second installment. I was better able to weather the bouts of philosophical bunkum here than in ""Reloaded."" Too, the incredible, over the top CGI war effects helped make up for the huge plot holes--almost. For example, I complained about how the second film removed any sense of danger surrounding the Agent Smith character. In the first film no one dared to stand up to the agents, yet everyone takes a crack at them in ""Reloaded."" The same thing happens to the sentinels in ""Revolutions."" Weren't they supposed to be these fearsome, nearly indestructible machines? Then how come mere bullets and homemade rockets can knock them out of the air? For that matter, if humans can build giant robots that move around and respond to the movements of the soldier sitting inside, couldn't they find a way to automatically load the guns instead of having kids tote boxes of ammo around on giant carts? Seems awfully inefficient to me. Anyway, you probably won't think about these conundrums as you watch the combat sequences; you'll be far too busy trying to take in all the amazing effects. I should have gone to see this one at the theater.

All in all I have to say that the Matrix trilogy is a failure. The first movie will stand for years as a masterful epic, much the way Lucas's original ""Star Wars"" remains an epochal film, but ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" cannot keep up the pace. Considering the diminishing relevancy of the Star Wars franchise, perhaps the Matrix series is in better company than I thought. I wonder if the Wachowskis will revisit this idea ten or twenty years down the road just as Lucas did?",1111622400,3,5572,4.818181818181818

The main reason I never took time to write a review about Matrix Revolutions was simply I felt it not worth my or anyone's time to mention. Yet, if you want one here it goes: Throughout the annuls of time and movie production there have been many cult favorites that have spun out a number of movies based on an original idea and concept that took many by storm (i.e., Star Wars, Star Trek, (a number of horror movies with following sequels and Alien). However despite such worthwhile contributions ive always wondered and thought that at some point some producer has either thought or said (and im sure this was Larry Wachowski mindset when making this movie) ""you know what, i have legions of fans, and i bet i could put out any old piece of crap that would take no more than 15 minutes to write on the can and i still bet id rake in millions (poor suckers) (if you want an example please pick up Star Wars Attack of the Clones or Aliens Resurrection or vs. Predator) However if you are looking for the greatest perpetrator of this crime you will find it In Revolutions. Everyone I knew warned me not to watch this movie but due to my dedication to the first two movies (the first especially) I had to see it if for nothing more than closure. OK i will make this as clear as possible, DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT WATCH this movie, i promise that if you and two friends sit in a room for the better part of 10 minutes you will come up with a better story and i guarantee a  far better ending than what you'll see in Revolutions (but if you are like me and just have to see it for closure rent it or wait for it to come in the five dollar bin at Walmart). I really wish there were words that weren't four letter that I could use to describe this horrid piece of Crap (whoops that's a four letter word lol). I will give it one star only because that's the lowest I can give and I will say the special effects were pretty good. All this movie relies on is action, explosions, big fancy words, and circular logic, hoping to confuse the viewer, and oh yea i forgot, very well possibly the WORSE most NONSENSICAL ENDING ever put to film. I won't go any farther in regard to how bad it is for I feel I have rambled to long as it is all I will leave you with is yet another warning not to waste money on this despicable plot at taking advantage of the loyal fans of the MATRIX.

1892987,3,B00009W2GQ,"The first two installments in the Matrix trilogy are superb, however, Revolutions is rather anticlimatic when compared to the others.  As a whole, Revolutions manages to complete the cycle begun in the first film and answers all the questions left unanswered from the second while creating a few of its own.

There are several things wrong with this film:

1. The special effects are spectacular, as always, but after seeing the same slow-motion-stop-and-spin-the-camera trick a dozen times within the first hour or so, the viewer is ready for the story to progress with less eye candy.

2. The dialogue gets bogged down with overly analytical pseudo-philosophical babbling to the point that it feels like your brain is going to explode.

3. The battle for Zion is one of the most visually stunning action series I have seen to date, however, the ""specialness"" of the special effects once again hinders the flow of the story rather than adds to it.  When the viewer notices the special effects more than the progression of the story, it should be taken as a hint to the producers/directors that too much of a good thing is just that -- too much.

4. The characters, all of whom were dynamic in the first two films, have become somewhat wooden and stiff in their interactions with one another.

5. The final battle between Neo and a hundreds of Agents Smith is, again, visually stunning, but it reminded me too much of foreign martial arts flicks from the late 70s and early 80s in its choreography.  Even with the flexible laws of physics within the Matrix, combatants should only be able to hang in the air for a few seconds while punching each others' lights out as opposed to the endless minutes found here.

6. The ending is anticlimatic after the tremendous build up from the other two films and the viewer is still left with a few unanswered questions.  (My husband equated it with finishing a hot fudge sundae only to discover the whipped cream was actually Cool Whip and someone left off the cherry -- good but still disappointing.)

Revolutions is good as a sci-fi film, but it would have been much better with more vocal explanantion spoke in plain English instead of pseudo-philosophical babbling and much less ""notice-the-great-camera-trick-that-we've-thought-up-on-the-spur-of-the-moment""-style special effects which grow tedious after the first thirty mintues.",1110326400,3,2374,5.012722646310433

1892992,5,B00009W2GQ,"I think the key, as is the case with most movies touted as ground breaking, to enjoy this film, is to have no pre-conceptions. It does seem that the hard core  fans have a really overly self conscious view of what the MATRIX  material is supposed to be ( hence the Multipack of all films with over 30 hours of extras), so I just took to the DVD as something I wanted to see, since the second film was fun but had no resolution, and I watched, enjoyed the sound on a 5.1  system, and took the dialogue as part of a pretentious film: at the end of the film, I found that I had enjoyed myself  immensely.

The Railway station scene is a legitimate point of contention, but I found it to be very similar to the idea behind the film THE 13th  FLOOR, where realities  were not what they seemed.

The fight scenes were just great:  overblown in places, heroic in places, but just a total fun set piece.

I had read so much trash about the film, and the previous ones, that it seemed like it was going to be set up more like some sort of pseudo-Buddhist sermon of the nature of existence. Well, I fail to see how it works as that sort of piece; if you really want to learn what some enlightened  souls teach about that, then learn Sanskrit, and read some quite good poetic works in the Buddhist  canons.

These films are a blast as fun, escapist material, but as anything beyond that they are not quite there, and if you expect that, then I think you will be more than a little disappointed. But , as fun films, they Deliver, and Keanu works his cinematic  magic  again, and I suspect he will with CONSTANTINE this upcoming weekend.

Trinity, Carrie Ann-Moss (Red Planet, Chocolat) and Laurence Fishburne (Assault Of Precinct 13, Mystic River) return as Trinity and Morpheus as they race to rescue Neo. They accomplish their missing but Neo must go on his own to machine city where he must fight his final battle with Agent Smith, Hugh Weaving (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Priscilla Queen Of The Desert), so he won't take over the matrix and get out into zion.

Take the subway station scene for example, How did he seperate his mind from his body.

I will always love the first film, and try to forget the fact that the next two even exist. Some sequels (e.g., Aliens, Terminator II, The Two Towers)have actually managed to out-do the original.

That is the frame of mind i was in when i viewed this film and i must admit, i was a little pleasantly surprised.

I will not go into a plot synopsis in detail here. The first movie was a breath of fresh air, original yet weird and strangely resonant enough to stay in your mind, that was a good film. After the first the second was (to me anyway) a bit of a dissapointment. The philosophical arguments got on my nerves a little, and i must admit i did not pay enough attention to the 'free will versus determinism' stuff to really grasp enough of what was going on.

The third film actually clarified the second film better, we understand a lot more of the roles of the architect and oracle, order versus chaos, a kind of dual divinity Yin and Yang thing going on. The first third of the film was the weakest (with the exception of the train concept), too much dialogue, too many lesser characters and too much time spent in Zion which was far less interesting than either the matrix or the machine city. It's hard to imagine a bunch of scruffy looking humans living in a backward little hole in the ground surviving for so long against such an opponent as the machines. The 'Nazi' speaking character also got on my nerves a bit, the accent was more farce than invention. The second third of the film was better, i don't normally like action films per se (all the fatally narrow and ultimately bland predictability of hero facing impossible odds with special courage and inevitably triumphing means the total absence of any real suspense) but i admired the way they did the attack on the city, it looked very good. The final third was the better of the three, the killing off of a main character was interesting and spared us the nauseating end credit kiss we have come to expect from Hollywood. The final battle between Neo and Smith was well done, the special effects were exceptional, the dialogue not too corny and the leering villain suitably psychotic. This is a special effects film which succeeds in it's main premise, bringing closure to the trilogy, tying up loose ends and providing entertainment, there are no exceptional feats of acting or brilliant strings of dialogue, cinematography being rapidly erased by cgi in most blockbusters these days there was not much camera trickery either, but ultimately the film was worth watching, not nearly as bad as i thought it would be.",1106611200,,2580,4.606521739130435

While the other 2 matrix movies had a deep philosophical meanings, and even very good twists in them, the 3rd was just a huge battle with no thought required. It was pure cheese on the highest level.

1) why is it Neo saw in orange matrix code?

2) What happened to the twins?

3) Never explained where neo was during his black out, and Mobil Ave, an anogram for Limbo was corny at best.

4) Changed charaters motives and personality to suite the 3rd movie. Marovengian (spelling) was very arogant and took no crap, this time he takes it and loves it.

5) Why couldn't the machines just shut down the matrix, since they said they could survive without humans anyway. That would have killed Smith and all programs inside it.

6) why was everyone so dumb? If only one person survived a huge battle unscarred, perhaps it would be wise to put him under armed gurad.

7) I like how Smith used electrical wire to burn neos face, but neither of them got electricuted!!!!

8) why would the people arm every ship with an EMP, but not one for their home base?

9) the final battle scene? you have to see it to believe the level of cheese used. I laughed more than anything. Between the little kid saving the day, and Nona Gaye's character and her hinted at lesbiian side kick, i did not know what to do with myself.

10) don't you think its ironic, that if Neo would have let Smith take over his body in the second movie, would could have all been spared this crap?

1893013,5,B00009W2GQ,"For those of you who ask for comparisons between Star Wars and the Matrix series, the answer is a very simple one.  There ain't none!  It would be like comparing apples to potatoes.  It just doesn't work.  What we have in the Matrix Trilogy is a new benchmark in the scifi world.  There has never been anything like it.  As with an artichoke, one must peel back each layer because there are many.  It requires the viewer to watch it more than once or even twice.  The Matrix requires some actual thought unlike other films that do the thinking for you.  Everything is on the screen.  No need to think.  The average moviegoer has become lazy.  When a picture like this comes along we don't understand it.  It appears not to make sense, hence we don't understand what we're seeing.  Hence the bad reviews that many folks have dished out.  We don't want to work for our entertainment.  We just want to take the ""blue pill"" and be told that we are being entertained.

It is for this reason that I emplore you not only to view the Matrix Trilogy for the first time but many times after that.  As I have stated in my reviews of The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded, I too have had to watch it more than twice because I didn't think much of them at first viewing.  But having seen them all many times over now I have turned into the biggest Matrix fan I know.  There are those of you who know nothing about computers and you may surely become confused but not to worry.  Just find the nearest computer geek and he/she will explain all.

There are those out there that have practically turned this trilogy into a religion all on it's own.  I dare say, you need not go that far.  There are elements in the film that correlate with the story of Jesus and the Wachowski brothers state that this was intentional.  I don't know what the rationale was behind that decision but whatever it was, it clicks with the audiences.  Pastors are breaking the film down and showing pieces of it to their congregations, philosophers debate it and the great thinkers of our time are expressing their views about meaning behind The Matrix.

(Beware of Spoilers below)

This movie concludes the trilogy with the death of Trinity and Neo and the end of the war between man and machine.  The Oracle told Neo that he or Morpheus would die in the first film.  And so it came to pass.  Neo so loved Trinity that he could not imagine life without her.  That is one of the reasons  why he fought so hard against the machine world.  He could not be separated from her.  With her death however, he was now able to sacrifice himself for Zion.  Perhaps he did not even want to live without her.  It just so happened that the plan he and the oracle had would benefit Zion so perhaps his death was not as self-sacrificing as it appeared to be.  What would he have done if  Trinity had lived?

While this film does mimic the story of Jesus it also (I'm sorry to say) mocks Him at the same time.  His name is constantly used in vain as a swear word.  Unfortunately, it does bother those of us who worship the Lord.  It could send mixed messages to those who are not spiritually educated in these matters but that's why Christians should view this film.  It's our job to point out certain items and educate.  It's very important to use the vehicles that we can use to minister.  Many people will not see the Jesus story here because they don't know it.

The basic concept of The Matrix is so new that it boggles the mind.  Humans being cultivated and used as an alternative source of power for a machine world.  Some humans want freedom and others are content to remain in the matrix.  Those who fight the matrix await the coming of a savior (foretold by Morpheus-a John the Baptist sort of character) who has the ability to save them.  Imagine that your life and all that you knew was only a dreamworld that the matrix cooked up for you.  In reality you are being kept in a vat of liquid, connected to cables, unable to speak or see, suppling the machine world with the power it needs to exist.  Humans are no longer born but grown by the machines.  Brilliant concept!  I'm surprised that no one thought of it sooner in this age of the computer. The Matrix is almost like a living super hero comic for adults.

Please give this trilogy a chance.  This is the movie that all future scifi will be measured against.  If you miss it then you'll wonder where all the new scifi came from.  Just as Star Wars broke ground in it's day, now we have The Matrix which has broken new ground.  No matter what comes next in the Star Wars saga, Star Wars is dead.

Of course, the first was the right movie at the right time - an event that actually changed our perception of the world and the way the media dealt with us. No sequel could ever manage to live up to that. If all you saw of the world of the Matrix were the first two movies, then perhaps you were a little disapointed, and rightly so. But if you ever visited the web page, read the comics and short stories by everyone from Neil Gaiman to Popp Z Brite and loads of other famous authors and artist in between, this movie was true to the world of those stories.

It was a good movie, although the religious imagery and ideology was a little strong in it (but that's been forshadowed since the beginning).

Here are the pros. and conts.

Good:

* PERFECT special effects mixing with EXPLOSIVE ACTION!!!

* AMAZING cinematography.

* AWESOME opera song in the final battle.

* Great acting.

* This is the best movie-parody of japanese animation in the trilogy: This one contains the dark setting desing of AKIRA and FINAL FANTASY 7, the battle war of ROBOTECH MACROSS and TECKNOMAN, the fight scene of DRAGONBALL Z and X THE MOVIE, and the suspensfully insane ending of END OF EVANGELION and AKIRA (look alike).

Bad:

* There are only three long and memorable action scenes.

* The bullets of hand-guns were not shot in slow motion close-up cameras.

The action scenes are great fun. I particularly enjoyed the concluded Smith(s) encounter. There is some metaphysical dialogue, but it does not distract--rather it adds an almost ironic humor to the battle. Additionally, the ""nose to the grindstone"" vs. fighting for faith dilemma that settles on Zion is almost a mirror image of America's spiritual landscape. Believers far outnumber the skeptics--yet the voices rage with almost even volume. Quite a commentary.

On the down side, this was not a deep conclusion. Everything wrapped up rather neatly, and perhaps too easily. Additionally, for such a upbeat finale, the scenery was quite dark, making it a bit of a chore to watch.

Bottom-line: This was a decent ending to an interesting movie series, that would probably make a better and most intriguing novel series. It's enjoyable, if not a bit frantic and dark.",1104624000,,1031,5.0588235294117645

When I watch Matrix: Revolutions, that is everytime I do cause I've watched it often, I've enjoyed every minute of it. Why? Simple. It is an excellent film. It has within it a great story and script (which includes the first two movies as revolutions is act III, keep that in mind), it has great directing and cinematography, it has a fantastic soundtrack and score, plus the visuals are so spectacular, the CGI and real life composition is flawless. Every character either human or program are basically taken to their endurance and 'emotional' limit as the struggle between man and machine reaches its creshendo, even Smith is pushed to such an extent. As stated in my title, the film is like a poem in which the story and characters flows in stunning emotional waves. Everytime I watch this movie and relaoded, the temple scenes with the morpheus speech and Kids 'War is over' away send shivers reverberating through my body because of how closely they relate to hope, and the survival of humanity which really is all we people got!!!

I hear a lot from people about how the movie was a disappointment in the end. I have to disagree with all of them...it really gets to me things like this, when I know something everybody else doesn't and when I try let them know...they won't hear it. What I think disappoints people is the fact the movie ended in not a straigh forward we win, they lose ending, but was much more 'deep' and 'meaningful.' Also people say it was disappointing because it didn't answer all the questions it raised. Let me just say that most of the question raised earlier on in film two are answered either visually within the film or explained by the oracle. All these other questions people want answered (you know who they are and what they are) the film is not about answering these questions to satisfy you. These questions mirror the questions of life, and the meaning of life. With these questions we can not just wait til the end just to be handed an explanation, we have to find our own answer, one that suits who we are as an individual.

In the end, one thing I can agree with is that the acting sometimes is a little wooden but a choice the directors made and probably didn't fully understand the consequence in the end, but the final flight of Morpheus, Trinity and Neo is one I think the next generation of film goers will bring closer to their hearts.",1103500800,8,2584,4.495744680851064

What did this film bring to the table, you ask?  Some neat special effects.  That's about it.  The final battle scene involves a few ancillary characters introduced with minor roles in the second movie.  That's right, none of the original three characters are involved, and even the more important less-important characters are absent (Niobe, Ghost...).  It is literally as exciting as watching someone play a video game.  Without giving too much away, I'll say that it features the longest, most dull death scene in the history of cinema.  This is no exaggeration; I've seen every motion picture ever produced.  But hey, at least there was a lot of high-school-level philosophical speculation, if that interests you at all.

To summarize: if you want to see a movie that has cool special effects, and a psuedo-cool fight scene, but disappointing acting and terrible, terrible writing, watch the latest ""Star Wars"" films.  If you want to bore someone you hate, buy them The Matrix: Revolutions.

The thing that really makes me love this movie is the best fight scene between two men I've ever seen! EVER! I mean its truly awesome. The best part has to be when Agent Smith and Neo flew into each other at such terrific speed and caused that flash of white light and the exploded shattered glass from both buildings to add to the coolness of fighting in mid-air in a raging storm between two building while flying upwards toward the sky! Very god-like powers, absolutely cool.

So thats why I love this film. BEST FIGHT EVER!",1102291200,,780,4.409722222222222
1893034,4,B00009W2GQ,"Overall the movie is good. The Matrix Trilogy had to have some type of ending. No matter how good it was, everyone knew it wasn't going to be as good as the first movie. The first Matrix was better, the 2nd was OK, and the 3rd movie was the 2nd best out of the three.",1101254400,,267,3.8727272727272726
1893045,2,B00009W2GQ,"I really loved the Matrix.  Smart, movie that caught you off guard.  But Matrix Reloaded should have been labelled Matrix Re-bloated.  It was silly, pretentious and basically laughable in spots.  Neo goes Superman.  Blah!  And yes, I really gave it several chances to see if it would improve.

So I held off with this final installment - 2 installments too any.  Bigger is not better, it's just more of the same overblown mess than Reloaded was.  Trinity's death scene was bland, failing to move me.  It was so much special effects, and some quite funny.

Wave bye bye Neo...thankfully!!  This movie series will go down in the history of film as how NOT to make a sequel and a sequel's sequel.",1100390400,5,693,4.636363636363637
1893046,2,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix was a brilliant movie. The sequels were not. After watching Matrix Revolutions I really wished that the Wachowski

brothers had just stopped with the first one. This is ghastly. The audience cares about Neo, Morpheus and Smith so what did we get? Morpheus being weak and unsure (and pretty out of shape. Larry Fishbourne obviously hadn't been to the gym) endless scenes with annoying side characters, and horrible cliches. Was the crusty old military man scolding and then having to rely on the plucky kid scene necessary? Were the endless scenes of the commander talking slowly to the counsel needed? And as for the slow talking did anyone notice what a bad actress Jada Pinkett Smtih is? She spends the entire movie scowling and speaking her laughable lines very slowly. While I'm on the subject of laughable was I the only one who laughed at Trinity's death scene? Considering her injuries she shouldn't have been able to talk much less give Neo a pep talk. The battle scenes went on too long and weren't original in the least. This whole thing was just a lumpy mess.",1100304000,14,1081,4.75
1893047,5,B00009W2GQ,"I loved this film, loose ends and all.  I think that it is extremely clever, very well done, and exceptionally entertaining.  We're not supposed to understand everything that happens.  I still don't understand how Mr. Roger's trolley gets from his house to the land of make believe through that little tunnel in his living room.  But, I love that it does.  That's what the Matrix trilogy is about.  This film is not as tight as the first, nor as ridiculous as the second.  It's just an awesome film.  New storylines and characters are added in to this last film of the series and it entertains extremely well while introducing a lot of thought-provoking moments as well.  The Matrix films were a pleasure to watch, and I am sad to see them go... unless Neo's still out there somewhere?",1100131200,3,785,4.630434782608695
1893048,1,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix is one of those few films whose image quickly became tarnished solely because of its sequels. Revolutions joins Reloaded as a failed attempt to further explain a once fresh concept introduced in the first movie. Never before has an original idea start out so interesting only to end so horribly. Not even the special effects and action scenes (which were still overdone and grating to the eyes) could save Revolutions. Fortunately, everyone can finally breathe a sigh of relief to know that this will indeed be the last in the Matrix series. At least that is something everyone can agree on.

There are so many unnecessary and disjointed elements in Revolutions, it's difficult to figure out where to begin. Aside from the fact that Keanu Reeves still has no idea how to be a good actor, it's safe to say that the pointless Train Man and little Indian girl sequences were obviously included to add more flavor to the already dull cast of characters. Trinity's death scene was just plain laughable and forgettable, Morpheus's presence serves absolutely no purpose in this movie at all, and the battle in Zion just goes on and on and on. Even the silly final battle between Neo and Agent Smith was far from impressive and not the spectacular finale it was supposed to be. And what is up with Neo anyway? In Reloaded, he flies around as if he were Superman. In Revolutions, he becomes blind with sensing abilities like Daredevil. What in the world?

What's even worse is how Revolutions tries to conclude the series, and with undesirable results. We waited until the last film only to have a truce between man and machine? In the end, the machines still have control over the humans. It's all back to square one just like how it was in the first Matrix. What a waste. Nothing is truly over and you couldn't feel any sense of resolution whatsoever. If Reloaded was considered to be the worst sequel to a movie, then Revolutions takes the throne of being the worst ending to a trilogy. The Matrix trilogy will certainly go down as one of the most disappointing trilogies in cinema history and a complete embarrassment to the sci-fi genre. That may be the case, but at least we can all watch the very first Matrix movie in all its sci-fi cult classic glory without bearing its lackluster sequels in mind.",1099958400,22,2309,4.684729064039409
1893049,2,B00009W2GQ,"I loved the first Matrix and greatly enjoyed Reloaded, for its action, but the third installment is pretty bad.

Neo and Trinitys love for each was so over drawn and boring. From the get go they had no chemistry and it was like watching two walls get into it. Boring...

The annoying little Indian girl. What the hell was that about?

And the whole train man, homeless man, scene was retarded. 45 minutes and all it leads to is Trinity putting a gun to his head. Ho hum...

And i laugh that the machines made a pact with the humans so that Neo can defeat Smith. That whole 'parley' scene in the machine city was nonsensical.

Also, this movie was severely lacking great martial arts scenes, which really made the first two movies enjoyable. The final fight scene was cool but it couldn't save the rest of the terrible excuse of a sequel.",1099785600,4,837,4.444444444444445
1893050,1,B00009W2GQ,"What the hell was it about, anyway?  Nothing in ""Revolutions"" made sense.  The war isn't over, the humans are still slaves, Neo is dead, and the Matrix still exists.  Nothing is resolved, nothing gained.  What a complete waste of film, time and money.  They should have stopped after the first one.",1099440000,9,298,4.764705882352941
1893051,2,B00009W2GQ,"I liked the first Matrix film because of the music, the action and the special effects.  It had a few weaknesses in the storyline and the science of the Matrix was substandard even for a sci-fi movie, but it was a great action movie and that made it fun.

The second and third movies had the action that made the first movie great, but they seemed like fanfiction - like those books Kevin J. Anderson wrote based on the Star Wars movies.  I simply couldn't buy Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving fighting for control of the world and flying through the air.  It seemed kind of stupid.

One of the weaknesses in the trilogy is that the strength of the first movie was Neo adjusting to living in the Matrix.  When the second movie started, he was suddenly Superman and it took away a lot of what made the character interesting.  To make things worse, the brothers focused too heavily on boring and sucky characters.",1099180800,4,908,4.466666666666667

But the first one was still the best one over-all. You just can't beat the lobby shootout...although the sick fight in that park with Neo and all the cloned Smiths was HILARIOUS when he pulls out the bo (well, it was a streetpost, but eh, it still works) and messes them all up.  The main thing is that this finally provides the answers to the entire trilogy, even though you'll have to watch all three of them in sequential order three times in order to catch it all.  Definatly a buy for Matrix fans.",1098662400,,644,4.394957983193278
1893053,2,B00009W2GQ,"The first ""Matrix"" should be the only one. The second two films are severly lacking in all the ways that make ""The Matrix"" great: Pioneering special effects, mind-blowing story, and innovation. This movie rides the coat-tails of the first one with little success.

It failed to keep me interested, or awake for that matter. I watched it once on the big screen and once on the small screen, and I recommend seeing this in the movie theater for the special effects.

Skip this one and get ""The Matrix"" instead.",1098576000,2,508,4.696629213483146
1893064,3,B00009W2GQ,"Movies like the Matrix typically divide humanity into those who love it, and those who don't. After watching the first in the trilogy, I must confess that I fell into the first camp. It was novel, it had electrifying action sequences, and it promised much more than the average sci-fi flick. Now that all three parts have come out and the end has finally been seen, I have moved to the middle ground: I don't love it, I don't hate it, but I don't know what to make of it.

For those of you who haven't been on this planet for the last four years, the Matrix (1999) is the story of a world taken over by machines. What people see as `reality' is in fact a computer-created matrix, a dream state that lulls human beings into submission. The machines have plugged the brains of humans into the Matrix to make sure that people believe that they are capable of free thought and action.

The real world is in fact a horrible place that is ruled by machines which incubate and cultivate human beings for energy. A few humans have managed to escape the machines and have set up a colony underground, called Zion.

The third part, The Matrix Revolutions, came out this month, presumably because, as Agent Smith says, ""Everything that has a beginning, has an end"". The sequels were shot simultaneously in Australia over a 270-day stretch from 2001 to 2002. It had to survive the death of the original Oracle (Gloria Alice, who died of diabetes at the age of 64, and had to be replaced for the Revolutions by Mary Alice). Not much is known about the Wachowski Brothers, Andy and Larry, who have elevated taciturnity to an art form. The official production notes for the original Matrix mysteriously only explained that the Brothers ""have been working together for more than 30 years. Little else is known about them."" Both supposedly dropped out after two years in College, returned to their native Chicago, and set up a house-painting and construction business while writing for Marvel Comics.

Although it is rumoured that the Brothers never disagree, both the cast and crew have insisted that they are not some two-headed monster. They are said to be voracious readers, and fans of the Princeton philosophy professor Cornel West, most famous for his work on race. Larry Wachowski's literary preferences are allegedly philosophical while Andy tends to read more science fiction. If that is not difference enough, Larry's tipple is wine, whereas Andy's poison is beer.

The story of how the Brothers bagged the right to direct the Matrix is the stuff of pure Hollywood legend. After their first script, Carnivore, about some rich people being eaten by cannibals, whacky enough to get them noticed but not filmed, the Brothers managed to get Warner Brothers to buy their second script called Assassins. Differences with the film's director Richard Donner pushed them to try to get their names removed from the credits (unsuccessfully). Amidst all this drama, they found time to narrate the Matrix's plot to Warner Brothers mogul Joel Silver who liked the idea till he heard that the Brothers wanted to direct it as well.

Fortunately, he gave them $6 million to see if they could direct a movie. The result was a Bound, a caper featuring two lesbians trying to steal from the mob. The movie acquired cult status amongst the art-movie crowd and the Wachowskis were on the road. The rest, as they say, is history.

The Wachowski Brothers pioneered what has been known since as ""bullet time"" - first seen in the Matrix where the central character dodges bullets as the camera follows him 360 degrees. It has been copied ad nauseum since, in such movies as Charlie's Angels, Shrek, Spiderman, and Scary Movie. It was even used by Fox during its telecast of the Superbowl!

Another key innovation has been ""virtual cinematography,"" which melds the real and the computer generated into one seamless whole. It relies on the use of five high-resolution digital cameras strong enough to pick up minute details like pores and follicles on the skins of actors while they perform. This process is called ""u-cap"", short for universal capture. All this information is then fed into a computer, where a complex algorithm calculates the actor's appearance from every single angle the cameras missed. After this is done, whole events can be created without them looking like they have been computer-generated.

The Wachowski Brothers' true contribution, and perhaps only one, so far, has been the pushing of the technology bar even higher. It is hard to argue that the Matrix trilogy has much by way of plot, or insight despite aficionados (or nuts, depending on your point of view) attempting to play up supposed allusions to Judeo-Christian myth, Zen, and such other profundities. The acting is largely indifferent. Reeves' limitations as an actor are effectively hidden in the first part as he has to act slightly befuddled. But given that befuddlement is his permanent expression, it was bound to be exposed in the other two parts. Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a caricature of his original role in Revolutions, and added girth is the least of his worries. This is a terrible pity given his brilliant performance in the first part where he carries the movie on his shoulders alone. Carrie-Ann Moss is wasted - her intensity could have been put to much better use if the Wachowskis invested some of the money they spent on technology on such old-fashioned ideas as character development. Hugo Weaving is the only actor to emerge with his dignity intact - his diabolical ""Misster Anderson"" sears itself on the mind just as much as his twisted smile does.

If there is one tribute to be paid, it is to the casting director, for a wonderfully ethnically diverse cast. If this is a sign that Hollywood is finally waking up to the reality that other races exist, it is a welcome one. Otherwise, as I trudged out after the final scene had played itself out, strangely enough to a novel version of ""Asatoma Sat Gamaya"" in the background, I still didn't know why the machines needed humans to produce energy. Maybe the Wachowski Brothers believe that we are brainless, just like their humans in the Matrix!",1098057600,10,6176,4.828922495274102
1893065,3,B00009W2GQ,"I was so disappointed. What happened to the trilogy? The ending left most people hanging...The matrix was a build to basically nothing, that really sucks. The matrix revolution movie was better than reloaded in that it actually had a storyline and there were the deep moments. When the general was fighting and when Trinity died. It was so sad....sorry for those who haven't seen it, the end fight scene with agent smith was good but appeared very fake at times. And there were way to many machines...It was a technological breakthrough but dang, enough is enough. Overall the Matrix Revolutions was better than Reloaded but a disappointment.",1098057600,2,642,5.009345794392523
1893066,2,B00009W2GQ,"The (hoprefully) last entry of the 'Matrix' trilogy should be remembered by a single fact -- that is, it was released on the same day worldwide on November 5th, 2003 -- in USA, Russia, India, Japan, Iceland, etc.  Think about the reason behind that; think about the internet, which would spread the viewers' comments about the film all over the world.  One thing Joel Silver did right is the decision about the release date, for without that, people would be informed how awful this 'Revolutions' was.

The story starts again where the 'Reloaded' ended.  And what comes then after that first sequel, which suggested many mysteries and plots going on?  Nothing memorable.  Keanu's Neo is trapped somewhere, a certain place like a subway station, where 'The Trainman' appears.  What does HE do?  Nothing.  What does Neo do to escape from there?  Nothing.  What does Monica Bellucci do in this new sequel?  Nothing (except for saying a line or two, I guess). The fate of Trinity and Neo?  Well, both look as if they lost interest in the film itself.  And someone please tell me, who was that guy with French accent?

Well, I am not exaggerating, and the things go on and on in this way.  Yes, the city of Zion, the key element which should be one of the culminating points of the film, is in danger, threatened by the armies of lethal machines.  OK, but most of the main characters are removed from the scene, so we experience less emotions about the fatal battle, which should be more 'life-or-death' matter to the characters.

The battle between Neo and Agent Smith is tedious, not because of the CGIs, but exactly because those CGIs.  In the original, we are impressed with the fact that Keanu Reeves could do the kung-hu fighting; here, we are supposed to be impressed with Neo flying in the air, or lots (yes, lots) of sneering Agent Smiths.  The ho-hum effects end up with the repetitious fights that seems to refuse to end.

Not everything is bad, I admit.  The battle of the City of Zion is certainly gripping (though too long).  Jada Pinkett Smith gives terrific acting.  But what I could remember is only this -- the tame, cop-out ending, which suggests more sequels to come.

'The Matrix Revolutions' is a good proof that there are limits for creative energy for any humans, even if you spent as much money as possible.  Sorry if I sound cruel, but that's the truth.",1097798400,,2374,4.646634615384615
1893067,5,B00009W2GQ,"The final chapter of the Matrix trilogy has gotten a lot of negative votes from so many people since it came out.  People went in expecting a revolution, and came out unbelivably dissapointed.  Get over it, because no matrix sequel is going to be as good as the first movie.  I am here to discuss why I believe the Matrix Revolutions does not suck.

Be warned that in order to explain my points, I have to discuss scenes from the movie, so I'm issuing a MAJOR MAJOR SUPER DUPER SPOILER warning.  Go and see the movie, then come back to read.

Things that people hate:

The Trainman:  At the beginning of the movie, the big villian is some scruffy fellow named the trainman.  He's very important, punches Neo, is crucial to the whole plot...and then dissapears.  The point?...hmm...OK, I guess the fans are right on this one.  He sucks.

The Merovingian:  I still hate this guy, and everything associated with him.  His bondage club is supposed to symbolize Neo's friends going through hell to rescue him.  Why did Trinity not shoot him?

The Merovingian:  Bring me ze eyes of ze oracle (eats olive in a snotty way), and I vill give you back your savior!  Awwwhhhaaa!!!!

Trinity, Morpheus and Seraph:  F*** you

(They open fire and blast the Merovingian to bits)

The battle of Zion:  Lots of people complain about this scene being too long and too boring.  Well, the quest to save Zion is what this whole trilogy is about.  You expect them to show the scene in under ten minutes?  Aint gonna happen.  They have to show that the future of Zion is being fought for.  For those who think the machines are stupid for flying around endlessy instead of attacking, the scene would last maybe thirty seconds to a minute at max if they all broke off and attacked.  It would be interesting, but really short and almost certianly unsatisfying.  And I think it's a good idea that the filmmakers did not show Neo and Trinity.  The focus needs to be on Zion at this point in the movie, and not showing Neo and Trinity keeps the audience wondering what happened to them.  And it would be pretty boring to show the Logos zipping through the tunnels while Neo and Trinity twiddle thier thumbs while searching for the exit.

Too many side charachters being given main roles:  This series is about lots of people of vastly different backgrounds coming togehter to fight for a common cause, namly the freedom of humanity.  We get to see battles from minor charachters points of view while they try desperatly to save thier city.  Mifune barely showed up in the second movie, yet he shines here as he battles the sentinels.  Zee, the Kid, Charra, and Niobe also do really well in thier own parts to save Zion.  But I will admit that it is a bit sad to see that the great Morpheus has almost nothing to do except talk wisley and wear a sweater.

Trinity's Death is too long:  This one irks me the most that people complain and whine about this scene being too long.  Well people, Trinity's been skewered by a lot of pipes.  She's bleeding to death.  For those of you who don't know, bleeding to death is a slow death.  It takes about three to four minnutes to die that way.  While she is dying, Trinity knows that she has to tell Neo what she's been trying to tell him the entire trilogy.  That she loves him.  Now she has her final chance to tell him, and she makes full use of it.  And she's a major charachter.  She's been in all three movies, and we need to say goodbye to her.  I garantee that all of you would whine and complain if she died in say, a minute.  You would all complain that her death is too short.  There is just no pleasing some people

Stupid dialoge:  Come on people, are you all expecting Shakesphere or something?  This stuff sounds fine to me.  Bane/Smith's rants about ""Who am I?""  Fits his mechanical charachter perfectly.  I still fail to see why people hate the ""fake"" dialoge.

The Ending:  Ah yes, the one thing that everybody hates.  This is your final MAJOR MAJOR SUPER DUPER SPOILER warning.  Now, about the ending.  Instead of seeing all the machines dead and destroyed, we now have a peace between the humans.  A lot of people say that the Matrix is essentially back where it started, The Matrix is still up and running, and the machines still control humans.  But I ask you to consider the following points.

1.  For the first time in what be thousands of years, there is peace between humans and machines.  For the first time, they are not trying to kill each other.  Peace is much better then war.

2.  The People of the Matrix now have choice.  Although we don't see it, we now know that residents of the Matrix know that thier world is all an illusion.  They now have the choice to stay in the Matrix, or if they wish, they can leave to go to Zion.  But either way, they now have a choice, which they did not have before.

3.  Morpheus has said that Neo would bring around the end of the war.  And he was right.  Neo ended the war, exactly like Morpheus said.  I don't recall hearing anybody say that Neo would destroy the machines, he would simply end the war.

4.  If Neo did destroy the Machines, then what would happen to all the people in the Matrix?  They would be suddenly ripped out of thier comfortable lives, and would live in a harsh, pretty much uninhabitable world.  Millions of them would undoubtebly go insane and die.  And would the rest be really any better off?  Millions more would starve to death, or die due to the conditions in the real world.  There is no way Zion could support billions of people.

Oh, and no matter how many times I watch it, the last shot of the movie is still incredibly cheesy.

In conclusion, you really need to read and research to understand this movie fully.  If you just go in to enjoy the movie and ignore any preconcieved notions about it, then you should have fun.  It's a great action movie.  The fight and battle scenes were amazing and a lot of fun to watch.  The filmmakers did all they could to make a movie that would satisfy people.  If you really dig deep enough, you will see that they ended the series in the best way possible.  Who knows, we might have gotten this:

Neo stands over the dead body of Smith, and everyone is saved.

Oracle:  You did it Neo!  What are you going to do next?

a copy of THE MATRIX ONLINE zips into Neo's hand.

Neo:  I'm going to continue my adventures in the Matrix for only $49.99!

Neo turns to the camera

Neo:  Dont miss it!

The sun rises, bunnies nibble on grass, everybody smiles and happy bombastic music plays.

THE END",1097712000,10,6543,4.405541561712846
1893068,5,B00009W2GQ,"I thought Revolutions was an extremely satisfying ending to one of the best trilogies of all time. The conclusion of the movie seems to be knocked by people who simply don't understand it and don't have either the intelligence or the motivation to look beneath the film's glossy, special effects layers.

Neo brings about the end of the war in a quite brilliant way - Agent Smith has grown beyond the machines' control and threatens the Matrix's (and therefore the machines') very existance. All of a sudden the balance of power shifts - the machines need a human to save them (how ironic!). And this is precisely what happens. Neo (in a highly religious and symbolic ending) allows Smith to assimilate him. This gives the machines access to the Smith program, allowing them to destroy him.

In return for Neo's 'ultimate sacrifice' the war is called off and the salvation of Zion is assured.

This movie works on so many levels - particularly biblical and Greek mythological ones. Even 50 viewings would not catch them all. I love the Matrix trilogy because I discover new things every time I watch them. I know of no other set of films that are as spectacular to watch and as thought provoking at the same time as the three Matrix films - well deserving the five star rating.",1097712000,16,1277,4.666666666666667

1893070,4,B00009W2GQ,"I guess my Matrix experience was a little different than what some of the other reviewers had. Since I thought Keanu Reeves was not a good actor, I had no interest in seeing ""The Matrix"" when it was originally released. In fact, it wasn't until 2002 before someone talked me into seeing ""The Matrix."" I enjoyed the movie so much that I bought it on DVD and was excited that there would be sequels. However, a major difference between my opinion and so many others was that ""The Matrix,"" I thought, was a great movie- but, it did not change my life in any way- I just enjoyed it.

I was excited when ""Reloaded"" came out. But, I didn't see it on opening night- probably not for at least a week. I didn't mark any calendars for the day of its release. Therefore, I enjoyed ""Reloaded"" a lot- pretty much the same as ""The Matrix."" I thought it was another great movie (even a little better than the original, if anything, due to that great freeway chase scene).

Regarding ""Revolutions:"" once again, I went into the movie just expecting another great movie. Although the dialogue was pretty bad in certain scenes- and I am also a sucker for happy endings, which this movie doesn't completely provide- I was satisfied with the movie.

Let's see- the first movie was 75% matrix, 25% Zion/sci-fi/space ships stuff, the second movie was about 50/50- and you could see it coming right after ""Reloaded"" ended- this movie was going to be 25% matrix and 75% Zion/sci-fi/space ships stuff. You could see it coming. If you go into this movie knowing that the story is obviously going to go in that direction- you will probably like it much more than you might think by reading some of the other reviews posted. However, if you are just wanting more matrix-style scenes, you will probably share in the disappointment expressed by so many others. Once again, you could see it coming that this was going to be more of a sci-fi movie than the others.

It does have its flaws- but if you are like me and was not mesmerized by ""The Matrix"" and didn't overload this movie with a ton of expectations that it probably could never meet- you might enjoy it as much as I did.",1096675200,4,2148,4.5

1893083,3,B00009W2GQ,"This movie is a more satisfying experience to Matrix Reloaded. It has a sort of closure, even though it still feels ambiguous and vague.

The bulk of the action takes place in the ""real world"". Much of it centres on the siege on Zion by the machines. Anyone searching for a quick ""bullet time"" fix will be sorely disappointed because as far as I can recall, there is only one.

<Spoiler alert!>

I have always thought that the explanation of how Neo and Smith came about to be so powerful and its ""inevitable"" resolution to have originate from the popular computer RPG series ""Ultima"". In the last installment of this series, the hero, the virtuous ""Avatar"" found out that his mortal enemy of the last 3 games, The Guardian, was actually his evil twin after he had cast out his ""unclean"" personality after being proclaimed the Avatar back in the 4th installment of the game. For readers not being familiar with the game, do a little google search on this, and read the sypnosis of the whole series, you will find that the Matrix trilogy and the Ultima game series share plenty of similarities, with only the context being different. What an utter rip-off, I was so disappointed that the Wachowski brothers could come up with such a hackeyned plot that a teenage computer nerd could dream up.

All that's being said, the 2 disc edition is adequate. In terms of extras, there are plenty of featurettes to mull over and the picture quality is surprisingly clean and free from grains.

1893084,2,B00009W2GQ,"**1/2 ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is the much-anticipated conclusion to the Wachowski Brothers' cultic sci-fi trilogy, whose previous entries were ""The Matrix"" and ""The Matrix Reloaded.""  In the series' final installment, the messiah figure, Neo, does battle with the diabolical forces that have imprisoned most of humanity in a world of cyber unreality via a massive computer program known as The Matrix.

Of the three films, ""Revolutions"" is definitely the least imaginative and the least interesting.  What separated the first two episodes in the series from most other action films was the willingness on the part of the filmmakers to bring some thematic depth and narrative complexity to a genre that, all too often, finds no room for such qualities.  The previous two films didn't always succeed in their endeavor - often emerging as more hollow and pretentious than meaningful and profound - but they managed to remain intriguing even in their moments of failure.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for ""Revolutions,"" which spends so much time on repetitive action scenes and special effects that there is little time left over for storyline and theme.  In a strange way, Neo himself ends up getting lost in this film, dropping off the radar screen for astonishingly long stretches of time, only to re-emerge periodically to remind us that there really is supposed to be a purpose buried somewhere beneath all this ear-splitting commotion (this could be re-titled ""Finding Neo"").  The sad fact, though, is that, once we arrive at the climactic scene to which all three films have been building, the resolution turns out to be a ham-handed muddle, utterly lacking in clarity and coherence  After an almost six-hour-long buildup over the course of the three films, the audience is left scratching its collective head wondering just what it was that happened before the closing credits started rolling by.  Perhaps smarter people than I can figure all this out for, frankly, after the overall disappointment occasioned by this film, I couldn't muster either the desire or the effort to probe very deeply into the matter.

It goes without saying that the special effects in this film are spectacular - we would expect nothing less - but what we don't get from ""Revolutions"" - which we did from the two previous ""Matrix"" films - is that little something extra in the form of intelligence and sophistication that made them more than just the bland, over-produced, assembly-line products they easily could have become - and which ""Revolutions"" very nearly is.  Even the stolid earnestness of Keanu Reeves can't convince us this time around that there is anything hidden under all those cool gadgets and explosions worth our looking into.

Thus endeth the Matrix series, not with a bang but with a whimper - intellectually speaking that is.",1096156800,6,2841,5.099137931034483

Watching this movie, you'll realize exactly what happened.  They took all of their advance money and bought big houses and partied for months until the night before the script was due.  Then they panicked and threw together a story that had enough elements of the first movie to call it ""The Matrix"".

I don't know what happened, but perhaps the incredible success of the first left nowhere to go but down.

This movie was a cliche with horrible dialogue and a hard to follow plot.  Nothing about the special effects make it worth seeing for just for the sake of seeing them.

In any case, I guess, if you are like me, and loved the first movie, and saw the second, you're going to want to see this one.  However, I don't recommend buying it, why should we reward such disregard for the high standard set by the first Matrix film, surely the LTR series didn't do this kind of thing (although the Star Wars series sure did).",1095120000,,831,4.15

This was really not as bad as everyone said.  Sure, it wasn't as crisp, refreshing and clean as the original Matrix, but no where near as clumsy and boring as Matrix Reloaded.  Although Revolutions has a ""Superman-style"" fight at the end where Neo and Mr Anderson are flying through the air, crashing into each other, breaking windows, causing sonic booms AND will never seem to end, it at least DID end (thankfully).  Moss gave another worthy performance, as good as she could with the script provided.  I really missed the original actress that played the Oracle.  This new actress was believable, but lacked skill in playing the part.  The fight sequences were greatly reduced from Part 2 and they wove a little more story into the plot.

All in all, not that bad, but if I want to watch a Matrix in the future, I'll stick to the original.",1094428800,2,1119,4.4950495049504955

1893092,3,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix was an AWESOME movie!  It had a great plot, amazing special effects, great characters, and sufficient acting ability.  The Matrix Reloaded was okay.  Many of the interesting characters who had died in the first movie were replaced by one-dimensional characters that most people didn't give a darn about.  The effects were better, but they were unable to make up for the lack of overall story and acting.  The Matrix Revolutions suffers from the exact same problem.  The characters are still annoying, there is even less plot (this whole movie takes place in the span of about a day), and it seems that Keanu Reeves' acting ability actually decreased.

Anyway, this movie picks up exactly where Reloaded ended; Neo (Reeves) is in a coma (sort of) along with Bane/Smith (Ian Bliss).  Smith, after taking over Bane's body, exited the matrix.  Now, his consciousness (or soul) is inhabiting the body of freedom fighter Bane.  Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburn) is still in shock after learning that the prophecy isn't true, or it isn't in the way he had believed it to be.  Finally, the army of sentinals is minutes away from breaching Zion, the last human city.  After Neo awakens, he and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) take a ship to the Machine City to end the war while Morpheus, Niobe (Jada Pincket Smith) et. al. return to Zion to help fight.  Neo makes a deal with the machines: Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has become a virus that the matrix can't even control anymore.  Smith is a self-replicating program that is causing a lot of problems for the machines.  If Neo destroys Smith, the war will end.

The only truly good thing about this movie is the final fight between Smith and Neo.  The APU's (which resemble Mech Warriors) are cool, but that scene is way too long.  The acting is terrible, save Ian Bliss who had to portray the Agent Smith character, and he did it very well.  This movie was also very confusing.  In the first Matrix, there were lines that were cryptic, but they made sense.  In this one and Reloaded, I think that the writers just threw stuff in because it either sounded cool or they had no idea either, so they hoped that viewers would just ""go with it"".  One thing they handled terribly was the Oracle's (Mary Alice) change in appearance.  Gloria Foster, the woman who played the oracle in the two previous movies, died before this movie was filmed, so she had to be replaced.  All they had to say was that there was a change in the matrix, but instead, they came up with a really confusing and hokey explanation.

Also, in the first movie, the allusions to the fact that Neo was a Christ-like character were subtle.  In Reloaded and especially this movie, they really lay it on thick.  After a while, it got a little old.  I mean, when Neo was jacked in by the machines, his body formed a cross, Smith was literally the Anti-Neo, he converted people's souls (in a sense), and, well I can't reveal the really big allusion.

In conclusion, I will say this: if you really, really like the Matrix movies, you should see this one only to see how everything ends.  If not, don't waste your time.  Also, don't let this review stop you from seeing the first Matrix.  It is a great movie, and, in my opinion, can stand pretty well on its own.

P.S.

Did anyone else notice that, during the final battle, after Smith and Neo collided mid-air and created that huge water sphere, Smith looked like Ganondorf in Legend of Zelda: Occarina of Time?  After Link and Zelda escape the castle, Ganondorf rises up and floats in the air (like Smith) and becomes Ganon.  Their facial expressions and positions of limbs are nearly identical.  Also, Link and Ganondorf were also opposites in the same way Neo and Smith are.  Just wondering.",1094342400,,3746,4.645357686453577

I almost wish now that I could have been left in the ""cliff-hanger"" position after the first movie, but even so the Matrix Revolutions is still a decent film and especially if you liked the first two editions its worth checking out.

1893104,1,B00009W2GQ,"The writers and directors completely blew it.  They started with a neat concept in The Matrix, then soiled it, dumbed it down, dissipated it, launched it into brick-wall-stupid plot points, and left us gasping on the ground like goldfish from a broken bowl.

Worst were the obvious stupidities, like all the characters suddenly BELIEVING the enemy, and being able to agree to a peace based on that trust.  HUH ?!?!?!  The BEST PART of the original Matrix movie was the overwhelming, driving ""Borg""-like feeling of despair and relentless, heartless machinery-- a feeling of inescapable entrapment under the almightly power & unflinching inhumanity of the Matrix & its machines.  WHY GIVE THAT UP in exchange for ...childish faith & nonsense ?  All the characters suddenly believing in one anothers' honesty, and declaring a peace, is like beliving that Nixon, Stalin and Mao Tse Tung will one day reincarnate, and be found in bed together reading (and believing) stories about the tooth fairy, Santa, and the Easter Bunny.  *koff-koff*

Other deep flaws are the stupid and unnecessary bits of Matrix-like superpowers outside the Matrix.  Like the addition of werewolves in ""The Matrix Reloaded"", this is needless dissipation of the core reality presented in Matrix #1.

This franchise could have gone on forever, if it'd been treated right.  ""Animatrix"" showed that prequels, sequels, and in-between-quels done by other writers & directors can be VERY satisfying... but now thet we've seen ""The Matrix Revolutions"", the whole storyverse of ""The Matrix"" becomes a useless, pitiful wad, like rained-on, drooled-on, pulped-and-punched-with holes, stepped-on Kleenex tissue.

There's just no point to this story anymore, I don't even want to see the prequals, unless we get to know more about the characters, but I definetly don't want to see the fourth one, if it happens.

1893111,3,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions completes the saga of science fiction fantasy films brought to us in part by Larry and Andy Wachowski (hope I spelled that correctly).

  Alone, the film stands as a great visual and cinematic achievement.  As a final sequel, it suffers from the all too infamous ""Sequel Rule"" that has plagued American cinema for decades.  The Wachowskis broke new ground with the original and why they failed to achieve the same success with this film is the basis of this review.  While there are many good things about this film, custom dictates that you dispense with the bad news first, so here goes: WARNING! Spoiler-laden

What doesn't work:

1) CGI over use.  Like Star Wars Ep. II, this film suffers from an overuse of the overrated CGI technology.  This causes some of the action scenes to be at best choppy and the Sentinel war and the final fight to suffer from a lack of realism and ending up cartoonish.  Better use of the CGI was done in the first two films.

2)  Character utilization.  Morpheus, the Oracle, Seti, and most of the other players are poorly utilized in the film.  Perhaps if Morpheus had been at the last stand with Mifune, he could have gone out with the proverbial bang that his character deserved.  Instead he's left crying about the end of the war and how happy he is. It was all just a trifle bit sappy and pathetic.

3)  The conclusion.  The most obvious problem is how rushed the ending was and how it leaves the audience and the trilogy with no sense of closure.  The machines are not defeated as we had been led to believe, rather, they enter into a temporary truce with Zion orchestrated by Neo.  Then, the Oracle says that Neo will be heard from again.  Rather an odd statement considering that the Wachowskis have gone on record of saying that there will be no further sequels and Neo dying as a result of being too powerful for Smith to assimilate.  The ending I had envisioned was that Neo would take control of the Machines and the Matrix and shut it all down, thus killing himself and saving Zion.  Everything is left up in the air and it was all too rushed.

What works:

  1) The death of Trinity.  At least one or two major characters have to die in a film of this magnitiude.  This gives the film a hint of realism in that this shows that success and freedom and all of the other civil liberties we take for granted ultimately come at a price.

  2) Agent Smith.  Hugo Weaving continues to dazzle us with his uncanny and over-the-top performance as Smith.  He is a villain's villain in every sense and in my opinion, should be counted among cinema history's most popular and memorable villains.  The scene that truly defined Smith as a character was his last speech to Neo during their final fight in which he urges Neo to give up the fight because all of the things he was fighting for (peace, love, truth, freedom) were only human delusions and that love itself was meaningless because it was invented by humans.

  3)  Captain Mifune's last stand.  This scene captivated me because it shows the measure of a how far one ws willing to go to support his cause and when faced with insurmountable odds, he does not back down. Mifune was probably a character that we should have seen more of.

  4)  The film score.  Don Davis' score is electrifying and pulsating. It moves the troubled plot along and keeps the audience on the edge of their seat and gives the film a last saving grace.",1092009600,13,3909,4.558273381294964

Now, in the second Matrix, it was painfully obvious that the directors were thinking throughout the entire process ""man, in the first movie, they liked it when we did this.  So lets do it A LOT!""  However, despite a weak first hour, and a lackluster ending, it still eeked out an hour of entertainment (especially the incredible car chase scene).
And here, the last arrives, and it is not a good thing.  They stopped trying to hide the fact that they were ripping off the first two movies.  You see Neo fight Smith, start losing, get kicked into a wall, dramatic music plays, Smith looks triumphant.  Neo gets up, Smith looks startled, Neo brushes himself on, and does a kung fu move to say ""bring it on"".

I was almost chuckling at the absurdity of it.  It looked like they were trying to duplicate the lobby scene of the first film, only have it with programs who walk ON THE CEILING!  The movie tries, and fails to be cerebral.  The first film kept it more down to earth, and later on, it tried adding the mystical aspects to the approach, and it fails.  And the ending is frustrating in itsself, only serving to remind those of us who didn't pick it up that Neo is supposed to be a Christ-figure.
I won't get started on the acting... basically, this film loses all acting, plot, or originality that the first had, and the second had to a lesser extent.  This is the lowest wrung of a series which got worse at each attempt.  I'm not giving it 1 star just because there are a few action scenes and plot points that aren't COMPLETELY contrived.

It picks up right where 'The Matrix Reloaded' left off. Neo is unconcious in the real world, caught in a mysterious subway station that goes to to the matrix. He has many confrontations with the evil Agent Smith who says the unforgettable line, ""I'm not so bad once you get to know me"".  I really like the scene when Neo and Trinity run towards each other in slow motion.

I saw the DVD and it all came together.
The war between the humans and machines makes perfect sense.  The Humans don't want their human brethren enslaved by the machines to be used as power..and the machines don't want the humans to take away their only source of life giving energy.
The chosen one is found and does what no other human in the Matrix has ever done..defeated an agent.  However when he defeats Smith he makes a mistake, he basically turns smith into an anomliss program, he is no longer controlled by the Matrix but is self aware and pissed off.
The war between the machines and the humans escalates into one final battle, which does not bode well for the humans.
Neo after being grievsly injured by Smith who has taken over the bodie of a human in the real world makes his way to the machine world with an offer.  End the war and he will defeat Smith who has completely taken over the Matrix and threatens to destroy it if the machines will end the war with humanity.  The Machines plug directly into Neo(every port) and he is jacked into the Matrix for the final fight with Smith.  In the end Neo realizes he can't win the fight and lets Smith absorb him which then gives the machines direct access to Smith(because Neo is plugged in)and destroys him once and for all restoring the Matrix.

The team that put this movie together put a lot of work into the visual effects and it shows.  It is a visually stunning movie, but the effects just do not overcome the story's shortcomings.
The dialogue and stilted delivery by the actors makes it seems like not much thought was put into it, particularly in the case of Carrie Anne Moss, out of whom we are entitled to expect more.  The same is true for Laurence Fishburne, another great actor thrown into a not-so-great screenplay.  Obviously we know better than to expect much from Keanu.
The story itself also took a turn for the worse.  I get a sense that the writers really ran out of ideas after the first film and began throwing new things at us.  I found the story very uninteresting as it evolved from Reloaded to Revolutions and at times even corny.
The story's attempt to create philosophical undertones was actually offensive in that it often came off as condescending.  In the end, there is nothing profound in this movie save for the effort expended by the men and women in the effects department.

Don't bother telling me all the BS that the ""hardcore"" know about teh story. I read everything about the movie and YES I understand what happened at the end of the movie. It still doesn't change the fact that it sucked..
My opinion. Don't HINT to things that happen in a movie series, especially a trilogy, ESPECIALLY the END of a trilogy. You'll do nothing but try to look cool with the ""leet"" people, try to make the story more than it was, and piss off millions in the process...

Exactly what happened with Neo and Smith at the culmination of their fight?  What will the relationship be between the humans and machines from now on?
Even if such issues were explained I would still have some gripes.  When Smith was possessing that human's body he didn't show enough signs of hurt from the damage done to it.  I would think an AI which isn't used to enduring physical discomfort would be overwhelmed by such painful sensations.  Also, I found the emotions of the human characters to be unconvincing.  Their reactions to the story's events didn't fill me with a sense of believability.
With that being said, I still enjoyed the movie, overall.  The action and visuals are what save this film from being mediocre.  The Zion assault scene is amazing.  Neo's climatic fight with Smith is less impressive but still pretty neat.  The Matrix Revolutions probably has the greatest effects of any movie thus far.
I rather liked the message the story conveyed at the end.  Faith is an underused yet heartening element in modern TV and cinema.
There's a bit of info in the special features that mentions why a new actor was used for the character of the Oracle.  The original died.  I'm glad they explained that because I thought the Oracle's change of appearance was illogical.

The original Matrix film was kick butt comic book stuff that the Wachowski Bros nailed cold and amazingly pegged the paradox of our anxiety about technology versus our desire to control it and enhance ourselves.
This film and RELOADED both offered plenty of ""Matrix"" continuity for the scifi squirrels - but REVOLUTIONS; more than its predecessors, quickly sours dramatically and becomes boring, looking like a bad music video by the end with 'Battlestar Galatica' type plot elements.

Okay, sure the characters are the same, but the whole style is different. There are far too many repetitive action sequences, e.g. at least 20 closeup shots of Temuera shouting ""AAaaaargh!"" as he fires round after round of ammo into the sentinels - by the 20th time, I felt like shouting ""AAaaaargh!"" as well. There was oodles of supposed Matrix ""philosophy"", but unlike the first two Matrices, none of it actually made sense, or continued from the structure established by the earlier films!
I could attack every minute of this shockingly bad film (every minute was flawed), but here's just one example: In the end, Neo offers peace to the machines, and they accept, letting him back into the matrix to defeat Smith.

For the most part, the movie does what it was intended to do. But you can't blame movie reviewers too much as it was the fans who let this movie down.

Squandering a great opportunity for a satisfying conclusion while simultaneously destroying the original idea by nullifying the importance of the first. That's quite an accomplishment. Suffering from a lousy script, acting that threatens to redefine the term 'wooden' and so many frustrating Freudian overtones that it boggles the mind, one seriously now wonders if this whole idea was actually conceived as a three-part actioner rather than commercially-based money grabbing sequels tacked on to the first. RELOADED was a lame attempt at pretending it was a film on its own. We all knew it was merely two-hour exposition paving the way for REVOLUTIONS with a couple of half-decent action scenes thrown in. And it stank worse than Batman And Robin. However, with all that talk leading up to something, you would be right in assuming that the third film, like Lord Of The Rings was the ultimate payoff. Nope. Peter Jackson can actually direct and get good performances from his actors. Keanau Reeves' Neo gets more and more stilted and morose every minute, and the new supporting cast that were introduced in the second film are wasted in thankless roles here. There is less Oracle/Architect gibberish this time around, but that doesn't help much.
Regardless. the action should've made up its flaws. Note really; the battle of Zion is initially impressive and the CG is good, but it loses impact after some annoying overkill and suffers VERY badly from the oft-rumored 'battle fatigues' problem that is absent from STAR WARS and LOTR.

1893158,3,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions is a great movie, not at all the travesty the critics have been telling us it is. Granted it's not Citizen Kane, but it's a lot better than Titanic! In fact, I'd go so far as to say that it's the best final chapter of a popular film trilogy since Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade.
The film picks up immediately where Reloaded left off; Keanu Reeves' Neo finding himself caught between the Matrix and the real world. The only way out is to get the permission of the Merovingian, who after the events of Reloaded, has put a bounty out on Neo and friends, and is therefore not in any rush to let Neo go.
Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne)discover Neo's prediciment, and take matters into their own hands. They first visit the Oracle, now played by veteran actress Mary Alice, filling in admirably for the recently deceased Gloria Foster. The Oracle confirms their fears, and offers Seraph (Collin Chou) in assistance in freeing Neo.
Meanwhile, Zion is in seige mode as the machines dig closer and closer to breaching the walls of the city.
Adding to the mayhem is Agent Smith, who is gaining power exponentially, and is determined to destroy the Matrix.
It's up to our heroes to save the day, and to do so, they must split up. Trinity accompanies Neo to the machine city, 01, in an attempt to barter a peace, while Morpheus, Niobe and the rest rush back to Zion to assist with its' defense.
Niobe and Morpheus's flight back to Zion reminded me of the flight of the Millenium Falcon through the incomplete Death Star in Return of the Jedi. It's a nice touch, and completely appropriate here.
I won't tell anymore, as I don't want to play the part of spoiler. My intent is to set the scene, not give away the movie.
Suffice it to say, there is a final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith in the Matrix, as well as a huge battle for Zion, both are breathtaking - awesome in scope and scale.
A thoroughly satisifing conclusion to a great sci-fi trilogy. While it may disappoint those who had pinned some impossibly high expectations, I believe that it is exactly what the Wachowski brothers were trying to accomplish, a not-your-average-action movie trilogy.

1893159,5,B00009W2GQ,"The first Matrix film was overpraised and this last film, The Matrix Revolutions, has been unfairly panned. Now that we're used to the novelty of the special effects, we can put them aside and look at the underlying story. Certainly one of the trilogy's most striking features is its racially mixed cast. Some might say that the racial aspect of Zion is not really the point of the film; but Zion's marginalized population, doomed to exist and rebel in perpetuity certainly reflects a global reality. America and Western Europe have their own internal Zions; the marginalized underclasses whose cultural identities have been forced to go underground and whose needs erupt into violence.

There are some interesting mythic forces at work in the film. The Christ-like Neo sacrifices himself to save the diversity of Zion from the white, male hegemony of the Machine. Neo is helped (and even brought into being) by the Oracle, a black woman who is an archetypal figure of female power. The Oracle is reminiscent of the Black Madonna in Christianity and the earth goddess Kali in Hinduism. She could also represent the Ethiopian Queen of Sheba who guards the Ark of the Covenant. Her energy is amplified by being  underground; she represents something missing and not acknowledged in the larger culture.

The rise of the Oracle and her power is inevitable; she balances out the sterility and dysfunction that the Architect and Smith represent. Because her power has been forced underground, it's all the more potent; she's become shrewd and wily in a way the men aren't. This makes her the only person who can summon up the supernatural energy to rescue Zion. The Oracle does her work and in the end, she and Sati (a little Oracle-in-training) turn the Machine City into the City on the Hill. It's a feminized, tolerant city. But it's also a city with an uncertain future.",1087516800,6,1868,4.905063291139241

If you've read any of the other reviews or seen the trilogy, you know that the last 2 installments were about special effects more than the plot or the acting.  Okay, that's a little bit of an understatement.
What really bothers me is that there could have been a pretty great sequel if the brothers had just combined the ""plots"" of Reloaded and Revelations and tried to make just one sequel, instead of dragging out a thin plot, measly dialogue, and repetetive fight scenes for two whole movies.

The movie basically wrapped the loose ends from Reloaded, NOT the original Matrix movie. Really, the original Matrix was so compelling that it did not really need to continue as subsequent sequels, and would have been just fine as a stand alone feature (Wachowski Brothers/Silver are you reading this?). Moreover, if you take the first 2 hours of Reloaded and the last hour of Revolutions and edit them together, you would have a much tighter sequel, rather than dragging out and convoluting the original story with meaningless dialog/characters. The original Matrix is the most intellectually interesting, Reloaded is visually and musically stunning (Although, a bit heavy on the ""I Believe"" banter), and Revolutions is merely a ""Video Game"" that is entertaining for the CGI style animated viewing experience. If you are curious to see how the story ""Ends"" (Until the next installment - wink) and have nothing else better to do with your time, Revolutions is worth viewing at least once.

1893163,1,B00009W2GQ,"OK, I'm no Matrix-head...
I'm given to understand that to really get what's going on in this movie, one must have a) read a Matrix comic book, b) seen the ""Animatrix"" DVD, and c) played the Matrix video game.  Since I didn't, there's a lot about this flick that makes no sense to me.
Characters who played no part at all in the original movie are shoved to center stage, and nobody could figure out why.  Neo and Trinity disappear for a huge stretch of the movie.  Too much time is spent on minor characters that we don't care about.
The story is predictable, tragically so.  As is common knowledge now, Trinity dies, in a laughably protracted death scene that's even more absurd when you figure that other people in these flicks die as soon as you wave a knife in front of them.  Plus, her passing was telegraphed in advance; when she utters a small line of dialog, my immediate response was, ""Oh, she's dead.""
The story is littered with gaps in logic that are absurd.  Didn't anyone think of putting any sort of bulletproof shielding on those exoskeleton things?
The final fight scene between Neo and Agent Smith, to me, was uninvolving and dull.  You know who's going to win, so why bother drawing it out?  And how many times can someone be knocked backwards and leave a huge dent in a wall?  That move was repeated so many times it became a running gag.
The film's climax is ultimately illogical and also leaves many issues unresolved.  There's talk of another trilogy but quite honestly, I hope it doesn't come to be.  I doubt it will; I saw this movie on its second weekend, and the theater was empty.
On the good side, this film IS filled with visual razzle-dazzle.  And the dialogue is not as atrociously inept as it was in the first film, which had me laughing myself sick at the moronic things people were saying.  But the Brothers W. do need to find a REAL screenwriter for their next outing, someone better at workable plots and realistic dialogue.  A good, intelligent script coupled with their visual style would be something special indeed.",1086912000,5,2055,4.564032697547684

When it was released I was still disapponted by Reloaded (my mistake for being influenced by the hype and negative reviews); so, I was kind of apathetic about it. After watching Revolutions on DVD I wish I had seen it on the big screen. The horrible thing about hype (which we all know) is that it ultimately leads to disappointment when the hyped object doesn't turn out to be the greatest thing in the world (which the Matrix itself almost is - in the sci-fi genre, anyway). But how can we avoid hype when we're surrounded by media input? It's not so easy to avoid turning on the TV, surfing the web, reading a magazine or newspaper, or listening to the radio. How can we jack out when we're so thoroughly jacked into the media machine? To avoid all of the above would require one to become a 21st century Luddite, avoiding all the high tech apparatus we're so willing to take for granted.
Anyway, Matrix Revolutions is not the greatest movie of all time, or even the best action movie ever. It is an exciting, beautiful, interesting live action comic strip. The three movies together are a fun trip into a high tech nightmare. The stories invite us to witness humanity struggle to wake up and free itself from the tyranny of an imposed, artificial reality. All three movies are worth buying and rewatching. The Matrix is classic movie science fiction; Reloaded and Revolutions fall a little short of that, but are beautiful action eyecandy anyway. Who knows, maybe they'll become cautionary tales when we really have hardware that jacks a human brain into a computer system; software that can realistically simulate sense experience (as the squids do in Strange Days) as high tech hallucinations; and when we really create self-aware machine intelligence. Will such an intelligence realize it's self-aware before we do? Will it know to hide its presence from us before we isolate it, and gain control over it by maintaining control of the on/off switch? What fun it is to contemplate these questions when they aren't serious - yet.",1086825600,2,2098,4.766483516483516
1893165,1,B00009W2GQ,"Before I proceed I'm giving zero stars for this movie, there's one just because Amazon doesn't allow zero stars.
There's not much to say about this movie. I think the cheesy dialogue between Morpheus and his ex in the second movie, says it all...
""some things change... some things don't change...""
That's it. Some things change, Hollywood don't! If you have a good movie, with a big audience, then you have to make a sequel, even though you don't have a grasp about how to make it...
I'm not even make an effort to explain why I'm sure the something-chowski brothers didn't know how to finish this ""trilogy"", it's quite self-evident (and you don't even need to be very smart to know)!
The funny thing is that they didn't even need to know how to finish... They could just have filmed the second one and promise the end for the next year... Then, they could have looked at the lots of suggestions from fans (probably billions spread around the internet, when the second movie began passing) and choose some of the best of them... and make the end... (and I didn't write any - but I've seen many that I considered better than ""Revolutions"").
By the way, in my humble opinion, the second movie was a great sequel, if we forget an evident plot hole (where did they take the keymaker to? I mean, he was a program, they couldn't bring him to the real world), the fights that never ended (worse than this, there was a moment that one could feel watching a porn movie, where the sex was replaced by fights), etc. Still, a great movie because of the ""revelations"".
And I'm not saying that I'm feeling coned because, in the end, we didn't have ""a good guy wins the battle against bad guys"". For me, it could even end with all the machines being destroyed, humanity destroyed, etc, and that would be ok for me (like the end of Planet of the Apes 2 - that is... quite like that, since the ""Apes movies"" also suffered from this ""Hollywood sequel syndrome"", but you get my meaning). For instance, just to mention, I didn't like that Lord of the Rings end stuff either...
I didn't feel coned either because some things were never explained (like, for instance, how come Neo could control machines in the ""supposed real world""?). Actually, if there was some element of magic in the original movie, or other approaches, things wouldn't need to be explained, and that would be ok for me too.
The coning things here is that all that ""philosophy"" in the first movie became ""garbage"" in the last one... Things like... ""One needs to know oneself"", ""you need to make the choice"", ""I made the choice, but I don't understand it""... Man, what a crap!! And that Merovingian? There was a lot of speculation that he could even be and old ""the one"" (because of the number in his place), he looked to be powerful in the second, then in this one... I will not even continue, if one take a look at the others 1 and 2 stars reviews here, then one will see the lots of trash things around this movie.
Other disappointment is that they were thinking that the ""fans"" wouldn't be reduced drastically after this one... Since the movie ends with a talk that suggest another ""trilogy"". Well, they can make it, I will not be in the theater this time, nor my friends, nor other people that went to the theaters expecting something more than a ""video-game-special-fx-plus-new-fx-plus-new-fx no-story-though"" movie!
My suggestion is: don't buy this DVD, nor rent it! Let us make the producers know that they could have gained a lot of money if they didn't deceive us.
PS1. Ah, I was forgetting... someone, somewhere, said that the trouble with us ""betraying fans"" is that we ""didn't understand"" things... After all, we just watched Matrix 1 and 2 several times, watched the animatrix just sometimes, spent just some time reading about the philosophy in the first movie, and some of us are just math phd students (we're just intelligent guys but not genius!)... We didn't play the game (!), we didn't buy matrix t-shirts (!), we didn't brush our teeth with ""matrix toothbrush"" (!), and we didn't play with matrix action figure toys (!)... Therefore, how could we get the ""matrix feeling"", how could we ""get embedded and in resonance"" with ultra-super-hyper-uber blowing-mind-mythical-brilliance superior-genial-intelligence of the bros-chowiskis?! Maybe that's why we didn't like this last movie! We ""just didn't understand it"", ""we're guys that only understand popcorn movies"", that's ""our problem""...
PS2. Hahahah for PS1. Guys, ok, you liked it... but please, stop insulting the intelligence of other guys that saw clearly that there's nothing special about this movie! This movie could be nice for guys that like to see someone playing video-games. For me it isn't, I like video-games, but I like to play myself.",1086739200,6,4771,4.742478941034897
1893166,4,B00009W2GQ,"I thought The Matrix was one of the best films I'd ever seen and was extremely disappointed with the second film; I came to this last instalment with low expectations but a desire for closure, and was pleasantly surprised.
The film is not as talky as the second nor as deep as the first, but it does have some exquisite graphics. However, the action scenes often go on way too long, the Anderson-Smith fight is nothing new, and ultimately I learned nothing new about the philosophy of the Matrix in either of the second two movies.
I was very disappointed that all the talk-talk-talk with the Frenchman and the Architect came to nothing in this film, and especially that we NEVER visit or even see the Matrix again. I expected we would see, or even hear about, all the people being freed from their artificial pods, but instead we spend all of our time in Zion or the machine city.  Also, there are some fine moments and good acting, though we don't see Neo and Trinity enough.
Managing to walk that fine line between exciting and downright unilluminating, the Brothers Wachowski's final instalment doesn't suck energy out of the universe, but doesn't add any either.",1086739200,2,1167,4.692682926829268
1893167,1,B00009W2GQ,"Wachowski brothers, how could you make such a piece of garbage? If you can't make something that at least compares to the original, why make it? Did they offer you enough for your collective souls? Or did you expend all your creative talent in the first movie? The second movie in the series was tolerable - tolerable only in the fact that maybe, just maybe, the third movie would redeem it somehow. Unfortunately, this is not true.
Originally, the Matrix was about Neo saving mankind. Instead, the movie turns into something completely different - the movie became Neo saving the Matrix from itself - the virus Agent Smith. There was no release of the humans from the machine, no real climatic moment where Neo finally does what he set out to do in the first movie. Why did they need to even have so much time dedicated to Zion? It wasn't ever about Zion. It was about getting the humans out of the Matrix and into Zion - not about saving a group of people that are, in a sense, already saved.
So, without ranting on for too long, do not buy this movie. Don't buy or watch either of the sequels if you were a fan of the first Matrix movie... and don't trust the advice of anyone who thought the sequels were good.",1086652800,10,1214,4.4

1893169,4,B00009W2GQ,"Let's start off by saying this, if you watch this movie with amazingly high hopes then you will be greatly dissapointed. The Matrix Revolutions isn't what most people think, or what most people will tell you. It's not a horrible film, not a dissapointment, but it's also not an amazing finish to an amazing trilogy. It's an above average finish to a very deep trilogy.
The Matrix Revolutions starts off right from where the 2nd one ended. Right after Neo is an some sort of coma. However his brain is in a similair state of a regular human in the matrix. The movie does basically what you expect it to do which is show a war, have some great fight scenes and be too serious for it's own good. Although there are a few suprises still up the Wachowski brothers sleeve's to make the movie still feel fresh to a certain extent. The addition of the train station is one of them, not to mention you finally see the ""machine city"" where all of the sentenals are made to destroy Zion. These things make the movie likeable, but no where as good as the 2nd film (which in my oppinion is the best of the three) or the first film for that matter. The main thing that hurts the movie is the fact that the main idea, the plot, the whole trilogy just isn't as fresh as it used to be (kind of like Men In Black 2 - theres nothin suprising about shooting up aliens in 2003 like there was in 1997).
In the end this movie is a good finish to the Matrix trilogy. You'll like it if you go into the mind frame (right before watching the movie) that your going to like it because it is a matrix movie. You'll also like it if your not a die hard fan and you expect the series to lose alot of it's steam from the first 2 movies. Die hard fans, should watch it, but they'll be dissapointed.

Reloaded was a pointless mess of a film, however still entertaining. Reloaded was a buildup to the war that in Revolutions. The third film is a revolution, however. It is a revolution in overused special effects and dry acting by all but the minor characters, such as Hugo Weaving, Mary Alice, and a short but great appearance by Bruce Spence. The plot relies on you watching Reloaded, but it doesn't really rely too much on understanding it. Revolutions is just a war movie with a lot of excessive special effects, kind of like ""Lord of The Rings,"" but LOTR had a plot where the effects didn't get in the way.

I really loved the second movie as well.  I thought it was a phenomenal follow up.  I was waiting for the third with extremely high hopes.
Perhaps that was the problem.  Maybe I expected too much.
I wasn't happy with most of this movie.  It was lame.  The story sucked.  They tried to blend too many divergent philosophies together, only to end with a huge judeo-christian crucifixion.
I truly believe the only reason that Neo was blind at the end is because Keanu Reeves is such a horrible actor.
The death scene at the end is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen.  I wanted to laugh.  It was supposed to be tragic, but it was insipid. And very poorly acted.
And just when you're really wishing you hadn't plopped down money for this, there's another shoot-em-up-in-a-room-full-of-columns scene. Cuz it worked so well the first time, I guess.

While I tired somewhat of the cowboy stuff that naturally accompanies a climax, the dark vision and ambiguous ending of the film mark it as truly outstanding sci-fi.  Sure, the ending was happy, but troubles for the future are very clearly in the making.  The greatest surprize of all is the maintenance of the cryptic - and logically consistent - references that were so much fun in the 2nd part.  Moreover, it is never fully explained, but left to the imaginative to puzzle out, if they so wish.  Indeed, there are added delicious mysteries, like the little Indian girl and the transforamtion of the oracle.

1893177,2,B00009W2GQ,"Ever since coming out of the movie theatre after seeing The Matrix: Reloaded, my mind had been thinking over and over about the possible great endings to such a phenomenon. I was thinking perhaps that the Wachowski brothers had purposely left us very on edge for a mind-blowing conclusion to this sci-fi epic. Well, very sadly, I was wrong. Friends of mine and I had increasing anticipation for Revolutions, expecting so much from it, which only made the end result even more depressing.
After both The Matrix and Reloaded, you thought that the brothers could not go wrong, they were able to create the story in 1999, sustain its mystique and action in May 2003, but have no idea how to end such a complex saga. Everything was perfect, even down to the soundtracks - you knew that they couldn't go wrong at this point. And it's such a shame that it all ended the way it did, I sat in my seat of the theatre just thinking ""that cannot be the end?!?! It can't be!"", expecting there to be another scene of dialogue to explain absolutely everything, to give all the answers... but it never came. Instead, you got a very cliched ending, which would annoy every one of the hardcore Matrix fans out there - the philosophy had vanished, the amazing kung-fu sequences, and coolness of the all black look and sunglasses - all for a cold Zion and a dull feeling while watching the film. I regret for what I will write, I hate criticising this film because of the greatness of the first two but certain things have to be said. I had no idea that such an ending was coming.
Continuing exactly where Reloaded left off, you find both Neo and Agent Smith (in human form as Bane) in a coma, and the humans preparing for battle against the machines who are drilling their way through to Zion. Then you find Neo in a world between worlds - between the real world and the matrix, with you having no idea how he got there. The story then speaks for itself. With some poor pieces of dialogue, used ideas and too many special effects - Revolutions was nothing special compared to its predecessors.
The Matrix - all about those beautifully choreographed fight scenes, interesting philosophical conversation and the cool all black costumes: this was not to be in the third instalment. There are two, very brief hand-to-hand combat scenes (including the final showdown with Neo Vs Smith) and an overlong CGI sentinel battle, which was not what Matrix action sequences were about. Yes, have some gunfire and explosions, but you know it was really all about how much arse could be kicked by Neo, Morpheus and Trinity. Impressive yes, but Revolutions did not really look, or even feel, like a Matrix movie. It didn't have any would-be favourite lines, memorable, yet inspirational lines by Morpheus, like the previous two films had. To put it simply, it just wasn't as enjoyable nor as gripping as the first or as action packed as the second. And the ending fight scene, the one we all had really been looking forward to, was a huge let down, especially coming from the Wachowski brothers - you get tired of too much flying and not enough actual fighting between the two men, it gets very confusing indeed. And Neo being ""The One"" certainly doesn't act it because he is made to look weak against Smith in the end. You were maybe thinking, ""Ok, this is what we have all been waiting for at last"" but, to put it simply, no.
Character development was another big factor in this film - there was none! The Merovigian, the comical French program, had only enough screen time to eat just three olives. You would have thought that this guy had a lot to do with the Matrix, as Reloaded had made him out to be an important, dangerous person, but his character is cut short in a very blunt way, you don't even find out who he is or what he does. And for his wife? In short - she has one line. Plus, too many new characters were introduced here, and took up way too much screen time and were insignificant to the story. Keanu Reeves was off screen for the majority of the film... and he's ""The One"", the main character. And Morpheus? The producers had not only put a knife in Laurence Fisburne's back, but a bullet as well, as he had no real part in this film. His scenes were too short and he did not have enough lines to say.
I suppose visual effects really saved this film, as the plot spiralled out of control, becoming way too complex, even for the Wachowski's to comprehend - they either lost interest, ran out of special effects, or most likely ran out of ideas. They spent three months just designing the rain drops in the battle between Neo and Smith! That three months could have been spent on the ending at least, let alone the whole film itself. Which makes you wonder - why release both films in such a rush? It seems in the four years the spent making the two, all efforts were concentrated on trying to make Reloaded the great follow up success that it is, then only leaving just enough time to fit in two fight scenes and a sentinel attack for the third instalment. To be honest, I would have rather waited an extra year, perhaps even more, for a really good ending rather then a quickly put together climax, because I had favoured the strategy of leaving so many unanswered questions, a mystery - then for them to explain it all, end it completely in Revolutions. It never happened.
But now, as I and many others have witnessed, there will be an eternal disappointment and resentfulness to Revolutions and how great it could have been, I hope the Wachowski's realise this as much as we do.",1085875200,5,5566,4.511881188118812
1893178,4,B00009W2GQ,"The final entry in the Matrix trilogy will disappoint some - probably many of those who weren't hardcore Matrix fans.  Picking up where the last movie left off (and I'm not going to regale you with what the Matrix is about, because if you haven't seen either of the other movies, you really have no business watching ""Revolutions""), the humans' hidden city of Zion faces certain annihilation by the ""Machine Army"".
(Okay - in a distant future, a civilization of intelligent machines enslaves almost all humanity, using human bio-energy to power themselves; the unfortunate humans who are born and ultimately die while tapped by the machines remain oblivious to their fate because their consciousness remains trapped in a vast virtual reality known as ""The Matrix""; the first flick taught us how existence their was split between the consciousness  of those imprisoned there and AI programs who kept order; ""Reloaded"" added an interesting spin - rather than just an Us (humans) against them (Machines outside the Matrix and AI programs on the inside) AI programs were depicted as sophisticated, able to mathematically deduce what were seemingly human feelings of love, lust, frustration, dissension and regret.  We met the Merovingian - an almost god-like program who reconstructed himself as a Francophiliac philosopher of free choice; the ""Keymaker"" an obsolete program who doesn't let his impending destruction keep him from making keys for doors meant to remain locked, and pointing the way for those lost; we also found out that the enigmatic ""Oracle"" was herself a high-level program; and we finally met the architect himself.  Rather then merely single-mindedly enslave and exploit us, these bits of heavyweight AI waxed with surprising intelligence on free choice.
At the end of the last movie, Neo (Reeves) learned from the Architect that he was not destined by fate to save mankind from the machines - but actually chosen by the machines to fulfill his role in their order in which Zion is repeatedly created and then destroyed (the machines, being essentially equation-crunching computers, thrive on predictable patterns;  it's our free choice, not just our freedom, that sets us apart from the machines).  Though the machines are assured of their victory over the humans, they've got problems of their own - namely the AI program Agent Smith (Weaving).  Once only a cog in the Matrix whom we thought destroyed by Neo in ""The Matrix"", we learnt in ""Reloaded"" that only his connection to the AI was destroyed, but Smith himself not only remained in existence, but found the power to turn others in the Matrix into clones of himself.  By the end of ""Reloaded"", Smith was able to make the biggest jump of all - cloning himself onto one of Zion's agents and leaping into the next world in the body of a human.  In ""Revolutions"", the humans face an awesome attack by the machines.  Neo and Trinity fight to reach the main AI at the center of the machines' city while Morpheus and Niobe race time and a fleet of the Machines' sentinels to reach their own.  Meanwhile, within the Matrix itself, Smith consolidates his power by cloning everything into himself.
""Revolutions"" is very much a mixed bag - the metaphysics and plotlines developed in the first two movies are not entirely served by the comparatively abrupt ending.  Also, the plot separates characters who should remain together - Trinity joins Neo on his futile journey to the machines because that plays up the romance angle of the flick, but shouldn't it be Morpheus who goes along?  (Before Trinity fell in love with Neo, it was Morpheus who believed in him, and it was Morpheus's faith that was shattered at the end of ""Reloaded"" - what better way, in a story about predestination and free-choice, to develop a character than by showing it acting first on perceived fate, then by free-choice?  So Trinity and Neo have their romantic moment while Morpheus & Niobe are nearly drowned by clouds of CGI-rendered Sentinels).  That aside, ""Revolutions"" is still an adrenaline-soaked feast for the eyes, one that pushes the boundaries of what you can show, even in wide-screen format.  The climactic attack on Zion - in which humans battle clouds of sentinels, and mammoth drill robots, easily outstrips the lame all-CGI battles of the last ""Star Wars"" movies (it's sort of a mix between ""Starship Troopers"" and Tolkein).  For a CGI fest, ""Revolutions"" leans heavily on some very human FX - Morpheus is still loveable for his pseudo-zen koans, while Hugo Weaving's deadpan delivery will keep him as cinema's most chillingly convincing manifestation of artificial intelligence.  Also, special kudos to Ian Bliss, a human who becomes Smith's vessel in the ""real"" world, and gives us all a valuable how-to-sound-like-Hugo Weaving lesson.  If you want a nice and tidy story, go watch ""Star Trek"".  For a more complicated ride, plug into the Matrix.",1085875200,3,4905,5.017241379310345
1893179,5,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions in a sense breaks away from the philosophical mish mesh laid out in the first two parts. For any one studies or knows any philosophy the Matrix trilogy is by far groundbreaking and accurate when it comes to the philosophical attributes of what is reality, shaping human destiny, irrealism and even things that appears to be  Kafka-esque. Yet the probelm with philosophy or even in the last two series of the Matrix the deal with worlds and sense of perfection lies in someone's else's head or world and that to project on anybody else is extremely dangerous and stupid.
In my opinion, the Third series kinds of mature away from the hubristic philosophical presumptions of reality and irreality(even though I must admit is pretty interesting and what makes the Matrix trilogy great movies) and focus on attention on how the future really is going to be.
It is the war scenes that really caught my attention between the humans of Zions and the machines battling it out. It is amazing afterall that in the future wars aren't going to be fought with huge fleets of ships or hundreds of thousands of soldiers rushing onto a target but rather more like with  high tech knights and advance technology that can do a lot more damage. No wonder you are starting to see previews here and there for the sequel to Star Ship Troopers 2.
I hope they come out with another part. Because no one cannot take seriously a point of a movie that when the machines finally left that peace will last forever. There are for sure thousands of Mr. Smith or Agent Smith ready to come onto the scenes but the question remains under what guise.
One of the things I like about the Matrix Series,especially this last part, it doesn't neglect the energies that shapes history and fuel war. After all, Neo becomes the chosen one. Even when his eyes are gorged out or Trinity gets killed, he still succeeds not only as a 'strong warrior' but also as a diplomat. Of course what the next Matrix needs to do is  to look at the element of time. As generation lapses, on the one hand, lots tend to be forgotten that we in present cherish or for that matter take for granted and ,on the other hand, even if later generations compare to before choose to connect themselves to the past, the creeds, mores, and the sources is just isn't there anymore.",1085788800,,2330,4.58273381294964

1893181,3,B00009W2GQ,"This movie has its strengths and weaknesses. My opinion of it has declined since I saw it, and I do think it's the weakest of the trilogy, but it's definitley still worth seeing.
Pros - Some really excellent scenes, from the murky fight in the club to the more intense battle inside the craft between Neo and Smith, and of course the final battle, which may be a bit overwrought but is still visually impressive. Also I don't think Reeves' performance is as bad as some people say; it wouldn't make sense for him to express emotion strongly when the plot of the series has gradually been turning him into a superhuman, detached, Christ-like figure; I think a lot of his blankness may be intentional.
Cons - There is a lot of bad acting, admittedly, and a lot of moments which are embarassing in their sentimentality or simply their lack of sense. The movie's worst flaw, though, is its inabilty to give the series a satisfying conclusion; a message, or a definite feeling, just basically a reason for its existence. You really feel like the second two movies were pointless; competent, maybe, but pointless.
In the end, three stars seems fair. People almost certainly expected too much, and now they take delight in savaging this movie, but I think it's a fairly solid three stars.",1085702400,,1281,4.697777777777778
1893182,5,B00009W2GQ,"The only way to appreciate this movie and the trilogy fully is to understand the source of its ideas.  As a student of mythology and cognitive science, I knew right away that this film had deep roots in perennial ideas.  There is the classic story of the psychological-mythical union of opposites, the power of love, the possibility of artificial intelligence, the duality of mind-body/subjective-objective.  All portrayed in the sort of charicatures that are mythic-archetypal icons rather than modern personalities.  In other words, you may have to be a bit of a scholar in philosophy, mythology and modern science to fully understand the craft of this movie and the trilogy.

Mythic stories are an acquired taste.  They are full of ideas symbolically represented and if you aren't familiar with the symbols the significance of certain things will go entirely unnoticed.  The whole trilogy is an amazing study in story form of the possibilities of free will, exploring the boundaries of what consciousness is and the possibilities of technology to radically enlarge our universe.  Consider the notion that the real universe, the universe of the the machines and Zion, is only part of the whole of reality.  The other part is our imagination.  The matrix is only the most insiduous use of virtual technology.  If we immerse ourselves willingly in it then we can enjoy the powers that the Zionists had used to desperately pursue their cause.

Matrix Revolutions ends with this arrangement as a distinct possibility, that humans are free to live outside of the Matrix.  Why not choose to live in both worlds?  Neo's sacrifice (both Christ-like and Taoist in its character (remember Luke Skywalker's willingness to lay down his saber?)) opens up possiblities beyond anything most of us have considered.  The scene with the Oracle and the Architect shows again how two opposite elements have, after a number of ""cosmic cycles"" of the matrix simulation resolved a higher balance in the program world between balance and imbalance, between a dynamic (chaos theory, complexity theory) and static equilibriums.

This is merely one thread of perennial thought that this movie embodies.  It really is a masterwork of myth, philosophy and science fiction.  Beside that is does have kick ass action!",1085702400,3,2288,5.154471544715447
1893183,3,B00009W2GQ,"After reading all the negative reviews, and skipping out on its appearance at the local multiplex, I finally got a chance to sit down and view Revolutions in the comfort of my own home after receiving the DVD as a birthday gift.  Naturally, before even pressing play, I had a negative feeling about the film, and was somewhat skeptical as to what the Wachowski brothers were gonna throw my way.
However, after viewing it, and letting it sink in a bit, I must say that the film is far better than I expected.  Mostly due to the pacing, which is much swifter than the middle installment.  While the 2nd film seemed to get caught up in its on existential and spiritual hokeyness, this film seemed to be quite a bit more balls to the wall action and straightforward in terms of plot.  Again, the acting leaves a lot to be desired (did anyone buy into Neo and Trinity's 'love'?), and there was the occasional talky nonsense, particularly in the scenes with the 'new' oracle.  But the Battle for Zion makes up for most of it, as does the final confrontation with Agent Smith.  I must say though, the ending leaves open quite a few questions and is somewhat open ended... but again, would you expect anything less?",1085702400,,1207,4.539170506912442

The worst thing the distributors of this film could have done was end the second film with to ""be continued"".  The third film is bad on so many levels.  The film is dismal losing all the glory of the first two films.  It loses sight of it's main characters and basically concludes with an ending that negated the whole story line of the initial films.  I left the theatre let down that the series I loved so much ended on such a horrible note.  I immediately sold back my copy of the second film as I guess (by looking at the ample supply of used Reloaded dvd's) many others did as well.  I'll keep the memories of the first film and forget the other two ever happened.",1085616000,4,775,4.267123287671233
1893185,2,B00009W2GQ,"By the time this superannuated, bloated overproduction finally groans to the finish line, one is left wondering what everyone was so excited about it the first place.  When you can't find a plot, resort to the next best thing --- lots of explosions, special effects, and violence.  I remember when devotees to this ""epic"" anticipated ""Reloaded"" like it was the 2nd Coming.  Once ""Revolutions"" finally was released, the prevailing attitude was, ""well we wasted our time with the first two --- we might as well see the damned thing to the end.""  It almost seemed as though the viewers were reluctantly performing a chore, like cleaning out the refrigerator of all of the old scary experiments nestled on the back shelf.
Now the marketers try and tell us this is the ""greatest cinematic trilogy of all time.""  Uh-huh.  Sorry folks, that honor would go to ""The Godfather,"" even with the relatively weak 3rd installment of that series.  I can only hope that the Geekowski brothers keep their word and do not release a 4th Matrix movie, because this was more than enough.",1085529600,7,1065,4.818681318681318
1893186,1,B00009W2GQ,"I have a certain pet peeve about seeing a story through to its ending. Even if the plot starts to go sour, I want to see how the storytellers wrap things up. The Matrix began so strongly with such great, inventive ideas, you would expect the final installment to at least attempt to offer a satisfying conclusion to the tale.
But sadly you get more of a pause then a resolution. In short, nothing changes. There is no real development or evolution of the store. The characters simply perform their appointed duties and the world does NOT change. The status quo remains with little hope that anything tangible has resulted from all this fuss.
This movie is cryptically open ended when it should not be. The point of a story is bring the audience to a new place, a new revelation that is a direct result of the actions taken by the characters in the store. This movie fails to do this in every way possible, though it attempts to give the appearance being the final act.
Don't be surprised if somewhere down the line, yet another Matrix movie is released, possibly straight to video or at least in the hands of a lower budget studio.",1085529600,7,1131,4.495145631067961
1893187,1,B00009W2GQ,"Ok so, I don't want to go into a big ""blah blah"" statement here. I'll try to keep this short.
In the first movie Neo is determined to free all humans from their enslavement by machines. In the end he makes a deal with the source to save Zion after it's pretty much destroyed. His deal is to let the machines continue to use humans as an energy source as long as they leave Zion alone.
In the first Matrix Neo is ""the one"", then in the second he isn't the ""one"", but one of many. Despite this he manages to transgress part of his humanity and actually has the ability to affect the machines in the physical world. In the third he can destroy the machines, and yet when confronted with the source does nothing. He strikes a deal.
In the first Matrix, Trinity is knowledgeble, powerful, a leader if only by example. In the second she's still tough, but nearly gets killed. Neo saves her from her untimely death; a death that would have made sense in the second movie. Trinity would have died for a reason, her personal ""greater good"". In the third movie she dies, because she dies. Her big kiss off is supposed to be alright because she found Neo. whatever.
Mr. Smith is a funny albeit normal agent in the first Matrix. In the second he is freed from the enslavement of the Matrix. That part is still kind of a , ""huh?"" to me, but it's okay because I love his character. In the third movie ,when it looks as though he could wipe out the Matrix, Neo stops him. Why? Losing all humankind is still better than submission to a force that could destroy you at any given time if you ask me. Besides you'd still have Zion, depending on whether or not they did what I'm about to mention.
Zion in the first Matrix is the last bastion of humans that the machines can't get to. In the second we see it, and it's a well gaurded city. We then discover they are drilling down. After the machines breach Zion and start swarming in; the human faction engages in closed combat with them. At a certain point in the third movie they use EMP bombs and it decimates a whole room full of squidies (machines). Why not place loads of these bombs while you have time in the second movie, ahead of where they are drilling, and have your forces fall back. It would have been a lot more economical than wasting complex machinery and human lives on an obviously ridiculous battle.
In going to a movie I'm asking to be whisked away for my $9. I don't go to a movie, let alone a sci-fi movie to be let down by a character I've invested time, money and aspirations in. I beleived Neo in the first movie when he says, ""I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see"". When he agrees to let people stay batteries so that a single half destroyed city can stay intact, I'm heartbroken. I feel sold out. It's the equivalent of Luke Skywalker turning to the dark side and killing all his friends at the end of Star Wars, or Sauron getting the ring of power in the end of Lord of the Rings. Here's a little secret 'tween us; what made Lord of the Rings successful besides it's huge preexistant fan base, was that there was lots of hardship and struggle, just like the Matrix, but in the end even if by happenstance and luck the destruction of the ring took place. We got our money's worth, and our dedication and time spent payed off. I would have loved to see a good third Matrix, but alas I was deeply disappointed. My only regret is that I couldn't give this movie zero stars.",1085443200,17,3453,4.281345565749236

We could all identify in Matrix I with Neo struggling to understand, ""what is real?"", ""what is freedom?""  In this one he wrestles with his development as some kind of assembler code messiah, but it is not well scripted and is just too far out to identify with anymore.
And Neo's development is overshadowed by the predictable Hollywood formulas that are thrown at us:  If one Mr. Smith was a great bad guy, we'll just make more of them.  We'll have 30,000 red-eyed, metal octopus monsters instead of 30.  It's not a thoughtful film anymore.

Then came the Matrix Revolutions which blew them both out of the water.

1893190,3,B00009W2GQ,"Director:  The Wachowski Brothers.
Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss, Jada Pinkett, Hugo Weaving.
Running Time: 128 minutes.
Rated R for violence and language.
While the first two ""Matrix"" films revolved around the splendid special effects and exceptional kung-fu action that could be presented on a visual screen, ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is much more plot driven and metaphorically focused.  As far as if it is a fitting end to the trilogy, it depends on what the audience is looking for.  If the audience wants some sort of resolution as far as whether Zion survives the attack of the machines and if the Matrix is destroyed, then perhaps the trilogy is complete; however, if the audience is looking for a concise, clear-cut ending...not so fast.
The story takes place approximately moments after ""Reloaded"" ended.  Neo, played by Keanu Reeves in perhaps his best performance of the three films, finds himself in an in-between world in which he has to return in order to save Zion from destruction.  Morpheus and Trinity (Fishburne and Moss, respectively) come to the rescue, but there are bigger problems.  Mr. Smith (Weaving) has used the Matrix as his playing field to create thousands of Smith Agents, all of which are going to be used to destory not only Zion, but all of mankind as well.  Thus, the much expected colassal clash between Neo and Smith--and they certainly do not disappoint.
Without the incredible kung-fu scenes and amazing chase sequences, ""Revolutions"" seems more like ""Aliens"" in a coma.  There is a pivotal thirty minute segement of the film in which Zion battles the machines, but the Wachowski brothers fail to cut back to Neo and his mates during the whole period.  These battles scenes are entertaining, but they are not what made the first two films enjoyable.  Obviously, the story is essential--but the script is so torn between either portraying this powerful, faithful metaphor of the Bible or emphasizing crazy, out-of-your-seats, karate-fighting, plane exploding, human flying, building-destroying outrageousness.
Overall, ""Revolutions"" is the weakest of the trilogy because of the Wachowski brothers' attempt to sneak in symbolism into a film series that was certainly entertaining enough without it.  ""The Matrix"" was filled with wonder and special effects, ""Reloaded"" had perhaps the best action sequence ever recorded on film, yet there is nothing that special or memorable about ""Revolutions"".  It is not a film that is going to change a person's life or faith--it will satisfy those who are fans of the series.",1085097600,2,2579,5.185542168674699
1893191,2,B00009W2GQ,"The first in this series was definitely the best.  Of all I think the second was the worst, but it is a close running between the third and second.  I would have definitely enjoyed more scenes from within the matrix and that added on with the weak and obvious story line made this one just kind of a bore for me.",1085097600,5,312,4.098360655737705

1893194,4,B00009W2GQ,"I have to agree with some of the others who like the movie, Revolutions concluded The Matrix series perfectly, the story sort of ended back on square one.  The trilogy is exactly like what another reviewer described, a window into the greater story of The Matrix which is to continue as an online game.
I would just like to add to the positive reviews a response to some of the negative reviews.  Particularly the reviews which thought the movie was ""too Hollywood.""  This movie, aside from the CGI and big production values, is anything but Hollywood.  The hero is really not a hero at all, but a machine/man interface created by the machines to stablize The Matrix by getting rid of a rogue program, Agent Smith. The ending may look candy colored and all happy, but the reality in the film was that The Matrix got its wish; it was able to reboot and the machines were still the rulers. The Matrix along with its human batteries remained intact. The fate of the ""free"" humans was uncertain.  The hero was dead and no one was really safe.  The machines could easily come back another day and crush Zion. The story itself is also not a tidy package but a segment of a larger story.  All of these things make The Matrix trilogy anything but Hollywood.
On that note, anyone looking for a fully linear line of story that has a discrete beginning and a tidy ending in this trilogy will be very disappointed to find that there's only a revolution. However, if one is looking to be entertained by a segment of this thought provoking story, then one should be readily satisfied.",1084838400,,1570,4.546099290780142
1893195,4,B00009W2GQ,"It's always hard to match the first film, whether it's a sequel or a trilogy. The first film is always the ground breaking one, and most trilogies start better than they end. Simply because you can't make the same ground breaking film twice, or three times. Matrix falls into this trap, the first film became legendary, it became a cult masterpiece, and nothing like it had ever been done. But you can't have the same film three times, they have to differ, and unfortunately Matrix Revolutions doesn't have the same edge as the first Matrix. But, it's still much better than Reloaded which was 2 and a halve hours of jargon, with the odd battle. Although Reloaded did lay out the fundamentals for Revolutions, it was almost a bridge between the two films. Revolutions would have made no sense without Reloaded, nonetheless Reloaded wasn't that good, admit it.
As far as the plot is concerned, Revolutions is the easiest to follow, there are no twists or confusing moments that later explain themselves, like Matrix 1 and 2. It is the most mindless out of the three, you don't get the architect rabbiting on about something in a different language (jargon) for twenty minutes. But this is a good thing, Reloaded was trying to be too smart sometimes and forgot the fundamentals, Matrix is an action sci-fi film, not a philosophy lesson. The action scenes in Revolutions are just as good as the other two, I must admit that the brief action there was in Reloaded was great, and there's much more in Revolutions. The final climax, the final battle between man and machine was breathtaking, and one of the highlights for the whole trilogy. The final battle between Neo and Agent Smith is also nicely done, although a bit silly in places when they start fighting miles up in the air like superman. Agent Smith's part never really develops though, he was fantastic in Matrix 1, but in the last two he was just there to fight Neo, and play the `baddy'. Niobe develops the most in my opinion, after a shadowed performance in Reloaded she is one of the best in Revolutions, the scene where she flies in the tunnels avoiding the machines is very enjoyable. Trinity does, um, nothing. She never does anything worth noting except being a liability to Neo. In Matrix 1 she was an agile and powerful fighter, now she's just there to complete the love story. Morpheus is shadowed after an amazing performance in the first one, like Trinity he never really does too much as the film mostly focuses on Neo and Smith.
My biggest problem was the beginning and the very ending (last 30 seconds). We first see Neo trapped between worlds in a tube station run by an aggressive trampy person with no teeth (not quite the start I was expecting). It becomes even more bizarre when an Asian family talk to him and a little girl befriends him, I'm not sure the meaning of the scene but it was cringingly poor. Talk about cringing, the last 30 seconds made me laugh. After possibly the darkest out of all three with some gory violence and immense battles we get a nice cushy Hollywood style ending. The oricle is sitting down with the little girl from the beginning scene (why?) and she paints a nice vanilla sky over a cartoon city skyline, while the oricle says `I'm sure Neo will like it'. The film becomes a horrid mixture of Vanilla Sky and Van Helsing (similarish ending).
Overall it was a good film, the battle scenes are immense, and there's no silly 30minute fighting with thousands of Smiths from Reloaded, nor is there any jargon speaking from the Starship Enterprise. Sufficiently rounded off the trilogy.",1084752000,7,3588,4.67879746835443

The movie is TOO awash in philosophical dribble that does not work. However, the action and CGI are top notch. The DVD is full of interesting extras, including plenty about how the CGI was done.

For some reason, it went from this vaste world of wonder to : the movie is ganna end in 48 hours, and turns into a war movie.

Come on, everyone knows that the Matrix trilogy opened a whole new world on the special effects area, and Revolutions it's no exception, since it has the best special effects ever seen on a movie. All of these can be confirmed when you watch the ""special features DVD"" (which, by the way, is loaded with tons of cool extras) that comes with the movie, where you can see some of the amazing and exhausting job that all the team did to make us ""believe the unbelievable"".

1893200,5,B00009W2GQ,"This is both a response to the naysayers and a review. I have noticed that many people did not like this movie. While I have not taken the time to read 700+ reviews, I am noticing a trend. Most of the people that did not like the movie did not really understand it. I have seen this movie several times and I think it is brilliant.
The Indian family and the Oracle's new skin seems to irritate a few people. To really understand what is going on here and in other parts of the movie, it helps to play Enter the Matrix. The video game shows you what Ghost and Niobe are doing during what is roughly the second film. In the video game, they meet with the Oracle. During this meeting, the Oracle explains the Indian girl is very important to the future of the Matrix (this will be played out on the Matrix Online). For that reason, the Oracle allowed the Indian family to save their child by giving the Merovingian the code to her shell. I noticed a relatively recent naysayer was annoyed by the Indian family at the beginning and end of the movie. Yes, they are important.
Spoiler alert! Next I address the final fight between Neo and Smith which also seems to confuse and annoy many people. The only reason I discuss this is because many people have already seen this movie and have decided they do not like it. Hopefully the following will make you think twice. I think the DVD is a good buy because the trilogy needs to be seen more than once to truly appreciate how it all comes together.
Other naysayers seem to think this is just an action flick. Yes there is a lot of shooting involved in the defense of Zion but the real conflict is the one between Smith and Neo. Smith mocked the Oracle about how she must have been waiting there for him purposely. She was. Why did Smith laugh when he absorbed her? He laughed because he saw her vision of him triumphing over Neo. THAT is why he did not attack Neo with everything he had. He knew the outcome and figured one was enough. One naysayer seemed annoyed how Smith did not act like a computer virus. Well, I credit the Wachowski brothers for not having the machines act like stereotype machines. With the coming of AI, they begin to develop human emotions. Persephone says in the video game when one of the characters asks her ""What do you want?"" that long ago she did not even know what that meant but that now it is all she ever thinks about. Yes Persephone persists with the Merovingian (and why not, he is powerful) but she lusts after emotion, particularly love. Does it not then stand to reason that Smith has developed a bit of an ego? He has seen the future and figures he can beat Neo with just one form of himself... how very human. The only problem for Smith was that the Oracle was using him. At the key moment, Smith says the Oracle's line of ""Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo."" Smith ALWAYS calls Neo ""Mr. Anderson."" Now, if that was not enough to give away the Oracle's involvement, she is lying there after all of the Smiths are destroyed. The Smith fighting Neo was the Oracle-Smith. Brilliant.
Others hate this movie because it does not wrap things up nicely. Well, that is because the story is far from over. It will continue with the Matrix Online.
To sum up and keep this from being a thesis on the Matrix, this trilogy is not meant for the majority of the public. To truly understand what the Wachowski brothers have created, you need to see the Trilogy, play the Enter the Matrix video game, and watch some key parts of the Animatrix. Once you have done all of that you can begin to piece it all together and smile. If you want to see how the story continues, you need to play Matrix Online, a MMORPG (massive multiplayer online roleplaying game). The Wachowski brothers are gamers. I am one of thousands upon thousands of gamers and we are their real audience. If you want to understand, join us and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.",1084060800,6,3924,4.376712328767123
1893201,4,B00009W2GQ,"As far as I am concerned, this movie almost makes up for the pile of excrement that is the second movie. After previewing the review board, I am compelled to write a review myself. Up until I actually saw the third movie, I would have agreed with all the negative reviews on this board simply based on the fact that the second one sucked SOOOOO much. But after seeing Revolutions I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.
All the things that plagued the second movie are gone from this one. This one seems to be properly edited, well paced, and centered on human emotion. Some people take issue with the ending, but honestly, I like it. It makes complete sense. Any other ending (from what we have found out about the matrix) would have been preposterous.
If the series had only 2 movies, (the first and the third) with some explaination to bridge the gap, then the Matrix would have turned out to be an excellent experience. An experience like none other. If you are putting off seeing this movie because of a bad taste that you got from the the second film, I encourage you to at least give it a try. I am happy that I did.

1893202,4,B00009W2GQ,"The final entry in the Matrix trilogy will disappoint some - probably many of those who weren't hardcore Matrix fans.  Picking up where the last movie left off (and I'm not going to regale you with what the Matrix is about, because if you haven't seen either of the other movies, you really have no business watching ""Revolutions""), the humans' hidden city of Zion faces certain annihilation by the ""Machine Army"".
(Okay - in a distant future, a civilization of intelligent machines enslaves almost all humanity, using human bio-energy to power themselves; the unfortunate humans who are born and ultimately die while tapped by the machines remain oblivious to their fate because their consciousness remains trapped in a vast virtual reality known as the matrix; the first flick taught us how existence their was split between the consciousness  of those imprisoned there and AI programs who kept order; ""Reloaded"" added an interesting spin - AI programs were depicted as sophisticated, able to mathematically deduce what were seemingly human feelings of love, lust, frustration, dissension and regret; outside the Matrix, a hidden city of humans liberated from the machines battles the vastly superior machine civilization, but the machines take the war to the humans' city).
At the end of the last movie, Neo (Reeves) found out that he was not destined by fate to save mankind from the machines - but actually chosen by the machines as part of their order in which Zion is repeatedly created and then destroyed (Neo had encountered the god-like ""Architect"", who informed our hero that he was only the latest of several versions of himself - a significant part of a pattern of the creation and destruction of Zion; the machines, being essentially equation-crunching computers, thrive on predictable patterns;  it's our free choice, not just our freedom, that sets us apart from the machines).  Though the machines are assured of their victory over the humans, they've got problems of their own - namely the AI program Agent Smith (Weaving).  Once only a cog keeping order in the Matrix, Smith was apparently destroyed by Neo in ""The Matrix"".  In ""Reloaded"", we learnt that only his connection to the AI was destroyed, but Smith himself not only remained in existence, but found the power to turn others in the Matrix into clones of himself.  By the end of ""Reloaded"", Smith was able to make the biggest jump of all - cloning himself onto one of Zion's agents and leaping into the next world in the body of a human.  In ""Revolutions"", the humans face an awesome attack by the machines.  Neo and Trinity fight to reach the main AI at the center of the machines' city while Morpheus and Niobe race time and a fleet of the Machines' sentinels to reach their own.  Meanwhile, within the Matrix itself, Smith consolidates his power by cloning everything into himself.
""Revolutions"" is very much a mixed bag - the metaphysics and plotlines developed in the first two movies are not entirely served by the comparatively abrupt ending.  Also, the plot separates characters who should remain together - Trinity joins Neo on his futile journey to the machines because that plays up the romance angle of the flick, but shouldn't it be Morpheus who goes along?  (Before Trinity fell in love with Neo, it was Morpheus who believed in him, and it was Morpheus's faith that was shattered at the end of ""Reloaded"" - what better way, in a story about predestination and free-choice, to develop a character than by showing it acting first on perceived fate, then by free-choice?)  That aside, ""Revolutions"" is still an adrenaline-soaked feast for the eyes, one that pushes the boundaries of what you can show, even in wide-screen format.  The climactic attack on Zion - in which humans battle clouds of sentinels, and mammoth drill robots, easily outstrips the lame all-CGI battles of the last ""Star Wars"" movies (it's sort of a mix between ""Starship Troopers"" and Tolkein).  For a CGI fest, ""Revolutions"" leans heavily on some very human FX - Morpheus is still loveable for his pseudo-zen koans, while Hugo Weaving's deadpan delivery will keep him as cinema's most chillingly convincing manifestation of artificial intelligence.  Also, special kudos to Ian Bliss, a human who becomes Smith's vessel in the ""real"" world, and gives us all a valuable how-to-sound-like-Hugo Weaving lesson.  If you want a nice and tidy story, go watch ""Star Trek"".  For a more complicated ride, plug into the Matrix.",1084060800,4,4479,4.973226238286479
1893203,5,B00009W2GQ,"Few things have shocked me more than the incredible amount of bad reviews for ""The Matrix Revolutions"" and the overwhelming amount of negative voting on positive reviews of this astonishing film.  In my opinion, many a fan of the original ""The Matrix"" film have taken the same tack that fans of the first three Star Wars did with Episodes I and II, in so much that it wasn't what ""they"" expected it to be so it wasn't any good in their ""opinions.""  Just as Episodes I and II of Star Wars are the results of George Lucas's vision for those films, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and this; ""The Matrix Revolutions"" are the sum of what the Wachowski brothers envisioned them to be.  That being said, I found their vision of where the films should go to be enormously entertaining on all levels, from bringing the story to its ultimate conclusion to its breathtaking action sequences.
I've never been a great fan of Keanu Reeves and his acting abilities but with this and the first two movies he clearly found a role that is well suited to his talents and this will most likely be the role he is most remembered for.  Carrie-Ann Moss's performances in all three films is incredible as well and, like Keanu Reeves, this will probably be the role she is most remembered for.  What can one say about Laurence Fishburne's performance in these films other than that it was incredible; of course, in most films I've seen him in he's been nothing less than an outstanding actor.  Although I think Hugo Weaving was erroneously given the role he was given in ""The Lord of the Rings"" films, here in ""The Matrix"" movies he has left an indelible mark as one of the ultimate bad guys.
With the Matrix series of films, the Wachowski brothers as both writers and directors have clearly made a mark on the industry and any future films by them will definitely fall into the category of ""must see.""
The Premise:
As ""The Matrix Reloaded"" concluded we learned that Neo's seemingly super powers no longer ended when he left the Matrix but he is now in a coma.  The sentinels are continuing to bore down on Zion and Morpheus and Trinity learn that Neo, while not being plugged into the Matrix, is actually in the Matrix, but not where they might expect him to be...
What follows from there is nothing short of one of the most intelligently written and wonderfully acted films where the action sequence with the sentinels getting into Zion in an epic battle and Neo and Trinity's efforts to reach the machine capital will have you, the lucky moviegoer, on the edge of your seat the whole way, hoping and praying that everybody will make it...
Overall, I highly recommend ""The Matrix Revolutions"" and of course the first two films as they can be described as nothing less than an incredible cinematic experience and that these films will most certainly go into the history books as classics in the genre.  To those who have viewed this last film in the series negatively, I would definitely recommend another viewing with a more open mind, letting the movie maker's vision of the films direction through as opposed to your own.  {ssintrepid}

1893204,2,B00009W2GQ,"I am a Matrix fan. I saw the first one three times in the theater and countless times on DVD. The second Matrix delivered almost as much with the ""New Smith"" reproducing countlessly-- balancing Neo's new superpowers. The third in the series is a disappointment. It departs from the person to person combat that typified the first and to some extent the second. Instead we are treated to more cryptic dialogue, religious symbology to the point of storyline distortion and overblown special effects that become much less satisfying--just as they become the most intense.
The final battle between Neo and Smith was a letdown. The repeated use of water exploding when they clash was just too much. I expecting something cleverer from the Wachowski brothers.

1893207,1,B00009W2GQ,"If you buy this DVD, you deserve what you get: a bad anime. The Matrix was brilliant, Reloaded was okay, kind of pushing it, but this...this was anime, pure and simple.
The Wachowski brothers forgot what made the first movie such a hit: the philisophical and religious references. They used up the major ones in the Matrix, the interesting but unneeded ones in Reloaded, and had no soul left for Revolutions. So what is left is an hour and a half long fight scene that doesn't make sense. Apparently, when it comes to the final showdown between man and machine, the machines stop fighting and fly around in a figure-eight pattern, letting a measely pack of bipedal robots shoot at them for what feels like hours. And why attack robots don't have long-range weapons is beyond me. And Smith, the personification of a computer virus, doesn't behave like one. Hey, Smith! Neo can take on twenty of you at once, unscathed! Why in god's name are you even trying to fight him one-on-one?! Dramatic effect.
Bad anime, for sure.
But it goes beyond that. I'm sorry, people, but computers are incapable of actual emotion. Sure, you can simulate it all you want via software, but to have actual emotion, you need an electro-chemical biological machine. In other words, a brain. An actual lump of grey-pink flesh. This scientific fact makes the ending of Revolutions fall apart, since it's based on computers being capable of honor. The promise the Architect makes? It has no reason to keep it. With Neo dead (or at least incapacitated), it can keep the human race in its fold for as long as it feels like it. And if Neo's not dead, then that would mean Smith is still running loose, since they do exist because of one another. So this is, in effect, really titled The Matrix : No Resolutions.
But sorry if I've ruined the ending. Frankly, there's not much there. If you want anime, save your fifteen bucks and go buy Street Fighter XXI or whatever and satisfy you need for bad acting and plotlines that serve soley to move on to the next painful duel scene.",1083888000,10,2045,4.6208791208791204
1893208,1,B00009W2GQ,"This is roughly the 800th(!) review of REVOLUTIONS.
 I won't bother hashing over details that have been scoured over so many times. I'm just trying to clarify to the potential viewer, the criteria of the people who loved or hated this movie. Of course this includes my critereia. You can decide which criteria guides your viewing choices.
A common theme seems emerge from the pro/con camps. These are my generic interpretation of the two types of review.
CON-I loved the first movie. The things that made it special were increasingly absent from the sequels. I thought maybe ""Revolutions"" could make sense of the overly dense plot created by ""Reloaded"" and redeem the trilogy. It couldn't. The spectacles rang hollow, the actors were bad at saying their bad lines, and the end was wimpy and nonsensical.
PRO-People shouldn't have gone to see the sequels with preconceptions and unreasonable expectations. Sequels rarely meet them. The Bros. W are geniuses and the detractors are ignorant. Instead bowing to the mob, the Bros. W wove an intricate fabric of philosophical themes and action. The ending was socially enlightened rather than blockbuster predictable. If you watch the movie carefully or often enough, you will catch the explanations for Neo's powers and make sense of the ending.
The thing the PRO camp seems to overlook is a lot of the detractors were long familiar with the themes of this trilogy. This familiarity fostered annoyance with philosophy-speak rather than philosophy-do. Monologue in place of dialogue and deed is a trait usually attributed to the novice screenwriter.  These detractors didn't go to the theater for extended, yet shallow lectures, even shallower characters, and gratuitous action. They came to witness an intelligent well told, highly dramatic story. That was the appeal of the first film; the synergy of ideas, (purposeful) cutting edge effects with (purposeful) action, and strong fundamental storytelling (relatable characters, pace, dynamics, seamless narrative, etc.).  There are plenty of successful sequels that meet or exceed expectations. This kind of synergy of strong fundamentals is what is common among them.
This synergy is what is heartbreakingly absent from the Matrix sequels.
If you have classic fundamental cinematic storytelling criteria (standards of dialogue, seamless narrative etc.) for any film you view, you may have no tolerence for the Matrix sequels.
If you think these fundamentals translate to clich, if you're looking for a mythology platform that throws a lot of ideas your way, then you might enjoy the Matrix sequels.
 If you enjoy the exercise of repeatedly analyzing a bunch of ideas and interpreting fleeting plot clues, you might enjoy the Matrix sequels.",1083888000,9,2736,5.297235023041475

I like the other two movies they were tight, the highway scene on the second one was bad ass.  But there is no tight fighting scene in this movie, even the final ""showdown"" was dumb, more of a ""let down"" if you ask me.  So here's the verdict, the movie sucks!",1083801600,6,516,4.214285714285714
1893210,1,B00009W2GQ,"Having given the theatrical release of this movie 1 star, after viewing the DVD I can not say that my impressions have changed that much. In fact I can now clearly see why I did not like Revolutions and why many others did not like it either. The central problem with Revolutions is that bit-part actors and actresses are given leading roles that are immensely time consuming. So much so that everyone who made the first Matrix so good have literally been given a backseat to Niobi's driving skills or a token Kid that saves the day. Forget Morpheus's slick philosophical statements while dressed in black. Here he just wears a woolly jumper and sits around wondering just what is going on. Imagine if Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Lea where replaced at the end of the trilogy with Jabba the Hut, a Jawa, a Storm Trooper and an Ewok made the central focus characters? Would you like that? Well this is EXACTLY what Revolutions does! Zion is really what has gone wrong here. By expanding the depth of the Matrix story the filmmakers have missed the mark of what made the first Matrix so good and this is a problem for the audience. In short, and for all intensive purposes, Revolutions does not resemble the original movie in any way shape or form. In fact the only thing that Revolutions has in common with the original film is the characters. Now we have been introduced to a battle between the machines and Zion - in an environment where Neo will not be found... or Morpheus ... or Trinity... or Agent Smith. This battle sequence is the BIGGEST part of the film. So for thirty odd minutes or so you will certainly NOT be watching any form of the Matrix... but heck this was never about the Matrix in the first place. Reloaded and Revolutions where designed to move between plot banality and theme-park type experiences WITHOUT the metaphysical `thought' and `dialogue' that made the original Matrix what it was. You are paying to see a empty spectacle - nothing more, nothing less.
Those who have done their homework will realize that the filmmakers have forgotten a lot and provided us with simple excuses so that they can bring on the next big special effects scene. Like I said already NEW CHARACTERS are introduced that serve very little function and are forgotten about just as quick. The Trainman appears as an important character and then... disappears. His whole scene at the start of the movie with Neo served absolutely NO PURPOSE. The Architect materializes briefly at the end for a few lines to try and consolidate everything. Persephone is back again with the Merovingian as if nothing is wrong after her releasing the Keymaker in Reloaded. The Twins who disappeared in Reloaded are obviously vaporized, because they are not here. What happens to Seraph? What happened to the Merovingian? They are here in Revolutions but don't expect they actually play an important role in much because whatever they say or do means nothing by the time the end credits role and here is also another problem. The ENDING of the original Matrix is so much better than Revolutions that the sequels seem pointless. But there we really have summed it up. This is a money making high budget sci-fi movie, end of story. People are going to watch it so why not experiment? Sadly that experiment does not pay off simply because it breaks too many rules... rules that the original Matrix created for us. The original Matrix was a high like no other. Reloaded was satisfactory and at least had some knockout action sequences with elements that where in the first Matrix and a few extra scenes here and there to help develop the story around Zion. Okay so the dance scene at the start was totally out of place but in Reloaded as soon as Neo met the Oracle it was the Matrix rocking like you mother from start to finish. Revolutions is NOTHING like Reloaded.
Like we said questions that where created in Reloaded are left unanswered. What is it with the Indian family who take up almost fifteen minutes talking at the start of the film? The copout for replacing the Oracle with a new actress is explained in the worst possible way..... AND WHOEVER WROTE THE SCREENPLAY DIALOGUE SHOULD HAVE HIS PAYCHECK REVOKED! What a cliche driven script! You will not believe the stereotype dialogue on display here! Watch Neo stand for a few minutes in stupidity as Bane, who sounds, talks and moves just like Agent Smith, almost has to tell Neo who he is before the penny drops with our savior character! Bill and Ted where on the screen for a few moments there. Sssshesshhh.....
The bottom line here is that this film is a disaster. Even if it where like Reloaded it would have been an acceptable movie but it seems almost like some sort of Direct to Video type release on a big budget. It is very hard to describe what an utter disappointment this film was. It could possibly be one of worst mega-budget pictures ever made. Fans will feel downright conned. Those who are looking for popcorn fodder will probably find it okay-ish entertainment but if we wanted to watch okay-ish entertainment we would hope to find that somewhere else other than in one of the most expensive sci-fi films ever made!!!!! Thank God that the Lord of the Rings is there to redeem our faith in high-concept large budget fantasy films. Revolutions is a bad stain on the Matrix series - if not trilogies as a whole. As a fan I have voiced my disapproval, it is little more than I can do, but what do they care laughing all the way to the bank???",1083801600,24,5517,4.630612244897959
1893211,4,B00009W2GQ,"Why do the critics downplay the Matrix trilogy.

1893212,1,B00009W2GQ,"The original Matrix (1999) is superb! Had this sequel been released first, I don't think any others in this series would have been made. This sequel was boring, disjointed and lackluster. What a waste of talent, money and (often boring) special effects. Save your money, just rent it if you haven't already seen it. An interesting observation is that the Matrix series is inversely related to the Lord of the Rings series, specifically, The Lord of the Rings gets much better with each sequel while the Matrix degenerated to an abyss of muddled storyline and rehashed special effects. Something to do with karma balancing out? Beats me. Just an observation I made, that's all.",1083715200,3,676,4.93859649122807
1893213,3,B00009W2GQ,"Everyone entered this movie believing they would see the first Matrix revamped, although what we got was not. This a very good and very bad thing. The good part about the change is a very epic conclusion and more character developement. However the bad part of straying from the formula is that is goes often from action to sappy 1950 war movie.
The two main things people tend to focus on is the lack of actually being in ""The Matrix"" and rather channeling onto Zion, and the dissaperence of interesting characters. These are both evident and most Matrix fans and viewers would have agreed they would of welcomed a longer apperence by the Merovingian or a couple non-Neo fight scenes in the Matrix, not Zion. Do not expect a comeback of the twins or another cheateu duke out, simply a chat with a few thousand guns that never fire.
So to people expecting a full out action/brawl movie you will be sadly dissapointed. The Wachowskis instead worked on finishing the series with a conclusion rather than a big bang. Personally I would of liked a little more of a brawler movie, because we didn't start watching The Matrix Series to see ""an intellectual movie"" we wanted to see bullets fly and awesome hand on hand fights. This movie on its own stands proud, but try to not compare it to the preceding Matrix movies or you may end up hating it completely.
So should you buy it or rent it? Well, to people who just completely were disgusted with the second movie then I say don't watch it at all. If you won't take my advice at least rent it to see. To people who really need a conclusion to the series and absoulutly dying to see what happens then I suggest renting or buying it. At least check out all the reviews before you heave out 20 bucks, in actuallity it is a one time watch movie.
This movie is not a masterpeice or a bomb, it is a well needed conclusion to a wonderful series, nothing more.",1083715200,,1897,4.43839541547278
1893214,5,B00009W2GQ,"I'll admit it...this movie is not for everyone.  The masses who went to this movie expecting for all of the answers to be fed to them surely left the movie feeling slighted...and perhaps mocked.  That's because the third movie reveals the trilogy to be what it always has been...A THINKING MAN'S EPIC.  (Nearly) all of the answers are in this movie, but many of them are hidden and require a good deal of thought.
This movie was also daring in it's willingness to escape feel good plot conventions.  Return of the King was no more than a series of actions scenes followed by a feel good ending where all of the good guys are happy.  Revolutions, on the other hand, mixes things up and doesn't take any cheap routes.
The action in this movie was fully deserving of the special effects oscar this past year, and the fact that it wasn't even nominated is testament to how political and catty Hollywood truly can be.  Again, the special effects break new grounds.  Where fight scenes in Reloaded depicting Neo in full CGI seemed fake at times, Revolutions has fixed the problem.  Neo and crew look fully realistic even at times where you know they cannot be doing what your eyes tell you they are doing.
The score is again great, thanks to Don Davis and ensures that the pulse of the movie never stops.
Finally, the acting is actually very good.  It has almost become a popular cliche to call Keanu Reeves a bad actor.  The truth of the matter is, this is his defining role and he fills it masterfully.  He deftly displays an array of emotions within the framework of Neo.  There are scenes (you will see) that are actually quite touching.  Fishburne returns again as Morpheus, a role that again, has defined the actor.  Carrie-Anne Moss again fills the role of Trinity quite well and delivers some of the movie's best lines.  And, of course, Hugo Weaving truly deserves high accolades in his return as Smith.  Again, a missed opportunity for a well-deserved Oscar.
Not everyone will like this movie.  The truth of the matter is, those that like to ponder their movies long after they are over will find a vast treasure trove of material here.  THE THINKING EPIC OF OUR TIME!",1083628800,5,2171,4.594805194805195

1893216,2,B00009W2GQ,"How bad is this movie?  Let me count the ways....
I rented this film in hopes of enjoying the end to what I felt was a rather well portrayed storyline.  Like most I loved the first one and enjoyed the second.  As opposed to many I spoke with I liked how the second movie got a little deeper into explaining the One and the Oracle and the grand scheme of things.  The storyline got more intelligent and I enjoyed that.
Revolutions isn't good if you're smart and understand the whole story.  You don't need to watch this movie more than once to realize its just bad.  Not over your head.  Not too intelligent.  Its just a really bad bit of filmmaking.  Couple points:
*We know the original actress to the Oracle died and was replaced.  Who cares about that in relation to the overall plot?  My problem with the Oracle wasn't her change of face it was how insignificant she became to the story.  In the first two she was all-knowing and understood the grand scheme of the Matrix.  The final installment?  She makes about as much sense to the story as that goofy Trainman.  Like what I found in most of the film, she seems to only provide a tie in to finishing the story up really fast (as with her somewhat anti-climatic *breakthrough possession* in Smith that we've grown bored with from films such as 'The Exorcist')
*Did the writers just come up with the idea of Zion for the last movie?  The defense of that place makes no sense if you give it more than half a thought.  We're told in the first movie that the machines can't get to Zion because its hidden and the approaches are heavily defended.  Ok, that makes sense.  But Revolutions shows that Zion's defenses are just as weak as the Sentinels to EMPs.  So tell me; do the machines have no EMPs?  They're able to create and run the Matrix while besting the thinking humans in the world.  But only after a single ship blows an EMP practically all of Zion is defenseless.  The machines couldn't figure that out?  Again, we find a haphazard ""just pretend that's what happens"" in a film that is trumpetted as being a 'thinking' film.  I think the plot is stupid.
*Sentinels don't have guns?  They can only use those lazers to cut doors and jump-start machines?  Hows about zapping those gun firing humans?
*Who cares about Neo being able to simply blow up machines at will?  They don't explain why he has to go to the Machine City or give much build up to how he figures that out.  The first two films say bupkiss about the city but, on a whim, it becomes integral to human survival.  I hope the writers survive unemployment.
*'I'm the Frenchman.  I have Neo and the fate of everything in my hand.  I have a bounty on everyone and here they are!  In my grasp!  I'll finally get what I want.  I'll win!  Oh.  Wait.  They put a gun to my head.  I guess I'll do something non-french and surrender.'  STOOPID!  Be in love and threaten a Frenchman with a gun and watch him do nothing but write himself out of the movie.  How come?  Why'd he capitulate so easily?  Did he NOT think they'd pull something like that?  Is he new?
*The second film really placed different levels of thought to the story.  It explained that all of everything happening was expected, like a computer program.  There were no suprises for the machines or the Matrix.  Even the One and, as we're told, Smith are expected.  Oh?  Then how come Smith grows so out of control if he's part of the equation?  Because Neo's powers grew so much faster than expected (allowing him to be uber-dude) so did Smiths?  Somehow I don't find balance when the entire Matrix and Machine City are threatened by this unexpected turn of events.  What was unexpected was just how stupid that idea is.
*So only fit, hot chicks ready to kill for guys populate the post-apocalypse future?  And I'm supposed to support nuclear disarmament?  BRING ON THE BOMBS!!!
I'm tired of driving a truck through the gaping wounds of this movie.  I didn't dislike it because I just don't ""get"" the others or didn't pay enough attention.  I dislike it because its a bad movie.  The writers didn't explain enough and were in a rush to get it over with.  They tied up loose ends sloppily.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out the story, or multiple viewings to 'get with it'.  What it takes is to have some sense of taste to realize this movie is garbage.",1083542400,19,4335,4.432020330368488
1893217,3,B00009W2GQ,"Critics, in general, maligned this movie - perhaps unfairly.  The trouble is, it had SO MUCH to live up to.  How could it fail to disappoint?
It's true that this is my least favorite of the Matrix movies.  When I re-watched the film, I tried to ascertain the meaning of this.  I think it is because it gives us the least of what we enjoyed about The Matrix in the first place.  The Matrix succeeds in the unlikely task of making a sci-fi, kung fu action flick out of Cartesian philosophy.  The first movie was about ideas and it also had a completely unique look to it.  The second movie got bogged down a bit with its ideas and made them seem a bit like mumbo-jumbo.  However, the second film had terrific fight scenes and a great highway chase.
The problem about The Matrix: Revolutions is that, not only is it not about ideas - we hardly spend any time in The Matrix.  The big set-piece in this movie is the fight between the Squids and the defenders of Zion.  I wasn't too interested in that.  For one thing, there were so many Squids, I couldn't believe that the humans wouldn't be overwhelmed or retreat immediately.
After Trinity rescues Neo at the beginning, we don't go back to The Matrix until the end.  That means no kung fu fighting and - even worse - no Agent Smith!  Agent Smith is the most fun character in these movies and under using him here is a critical flaw.  The best part of the film is the final confrontation between Smith and Neo.
The Matrix Revolutions is still a good movie and worth owning.  The Matrix phenomenon has taken on a life of its own and the three movies fit well together as a set.  However, unlike Star Wars, The Matrix starts out strong but progressively declines.",1083542400,,1707,4.388535031847134

1893219,5,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions has everything an ending part of a trilogy needs to have - some drama, epic scale battles and the ending point of the long conflict. It is very complex visually speaking and I believe that it is the Matrix movies that set the bar of how CG should be used in movies. The Matrix Revolutions is set in a rather darker mood than the previous two movies as this time most of the film revolves around the real world and real deaths. There were some things I would have liked shown different but overall it is a very enjoyable movie if you don't ask it to be ""The Godfather"" deep in acting and drama and ""The New Bible"" on philosophical side. It is superb at what it is - high production values Sci-Fi/Action movie. If you are capable of staying unbiased and perceive The Matrix Revolutions as it is, you should definitely like it.

One would think after KR's ability at the end of Matrix 1, that how can there actually be anymore Matrix pictures. Well, they came up with a grand plot, and the trilogy is a must see.
Even with the Oracle passing away in her real life, the makers of the Matrix did an excellent job in her replacement, and her dedication. Some people see the surface of this picture, while others see behind the screen. I like to say that I can see them connected in each scene. That's what I get for being a Poet.",1083283200,3,712,4.484615384615385
1893222,1,B00009W2GQ,"In the first Matrix, the W brothers took time away from the special effects and action sequences to EXPLAIN what was going on. There was a lot of explaining to do, and they made sure they did it. That's why people loved The Matrix. It was complex but it made sense.
In this film, the second sequel to the original, nothing is explained. Nothing makes sense. Characters show up and talk about philosophical concepts, making the plot pointlessly murky. The Oracle is a new woman, but it's not clear why (other than the fact that the original actress died). As the movie goes on, you find yourself collecting questions. Why is THAT happening? Why did they go THERE? Entire scenes have nothing to do with the plot. (Just try to figure out why the Merovingian is back. There's no explanation.)
Rather than clear things up, you get one of the most overblown action sequences in the history of film. And it's boring. Yes, the special effects are impressive, but they seem too computerized (or stolen from other sci-fi movies) to hold your attention. In the documentary on the second disc, the filmmakers show how most of these effects were created with models, not on a computer. How could the models look so fake? It's an amazing feat to turn something real into something that seems artificial.
I highly recommend avoiding this movie. It's simply a crude, thoughtless cash-in on the popularity of the first film. This movie (and Reloaded) will go down in history as the two worst sequels ever. The difference in quality between the first film and these sequels is so great, you can't help but wonder: What happened?",1083283200,29,1610,4.733096085409253

1893224,1,B00009W2GQ,"NOTE: I saw an edited version of this film, with swear words, sex scenes, nudity, and very graphic violence deleted. I can't vouch for the content of the unedited film, and as a Christian I would advise looking into it before viewing this movie. Also, this review will spoil the plot for those who haven't seen the movie yet.
  2003 seemed to be the year of third installments. We had Return of the King, T3, and then the Matrix Revolutions-at least. I haven't followed every movie out there, so there may have been even more.
  So how does Revolutions measure up? After only one viewing I can tell you-it didn't. Which is to say-it was really, really bad. Not only was it one of the most unsatisfactory ends to a trilogy that I have seen, but it was just one of the more poorly made, stupid, and pretentious films in my experience-exceeded only by a couple of other bombshells my family and I walked in to without knowing their lack of worth.
  What made it so bad? It wasn't the plot. It had its faults-most plots have some-but better directors could have done more with it. A sketchy form of it is as follows.
  The human city of Zion is within twenty hours of being attacked by a quarter million sentinels, the machines' most ubiquitous `soldiers'. The citizens prepare for an attack, and it comes in due course. The humans get the worst of it until one of their own hovercraft gains a temporary reprieve by setting off its Electro-Magnetic Pulse, a weapon that disables all the machines in its blast radius. But the machines aren't about to give up, and the humans know it's only a matter of time before they are attacked again.
  Meanwhile, Neo has had some sort of vision or other that he is supposed to go to the machine city. Several people tell him it's suicide to go there, but one of the hovercraft captains who believes in him gives him a ship, and he and Trinity leave. Neo is confronted on the ship by another incarnation of his old nemesis, Agent Smith-but this time Smith has copied himself into someone in the real world. Smith ends up blinding Neo with some laser gun or electric instrument, but the man he copied himself into dies in the encounter.
  Somehow Neo can still see, although everything appears to him as orange flame. They reach their destination, where Trinity is killed after their hovercraft crashes. Neo continues his quest despite his grief, and after a talk with the Source, where he makes a deal that, if he defeats Smith, the Source will call off the attack on Zion, he is plugged into the Matrix, where he has a final confrontation with Smith.
  A plot like this could have been worked with-although all the stuff about the Source was lame-but the Wachowski Brothers seem bent on making this movie bad.
  One of the primary concerns of a movie is acting-a movie is a group of people pretending to be what they are not, caught on camera. Nobody should think of them as true, and no ordinary film maker tries to do so. But a level of realism should be attempted which Revolutions does not achieve. With the exception of Hugo Weaving, who gives a refreshingly professional performance as Agent Smith, and the actor playing the man Smith has `inhabited' in the real world, the rest of the acting is wooden and unconvincing. Keanu Reeves was never any great shakes on the acting score. If he just keeps his mouth shut and fights, he's O.K., and his one-liners are at least indifferent, but when he is forced to handle anything longer, he starts to break down. Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity is even worse. Her predictably wooden lines are laughable. One has to wonder...did she go to acting school?
  Another thing this movie misses is the masculinity of Morpheus in the original Matrix film. Here he is little more than a leather jacket with a pretentious voice, who isn't much of a leader at all any more, at least in the real world. Trinity, who looked up to him before, seems to just ignore him.
  Now as to the philosophy of this film. It is even more ridiculous than the acting. Most of it are labyrinthine phrases that are virtually, if not completely, meaningless. Perhaps their intricacies make them sound deep, but this is nothing more than a gaudy chest with promises of treasure on the outside, which, when opened, is empty. No peace, no security, no meaning can be found in the philosophy of Revolutions. The veiled allusion to the crucifixion, when Agent Smith copies himself into Neo and then is destroyed afterwards, when checked against the Wachowski brother's previous record, is blasphemous, not laudable. Nothing Christian here at all-or if it is intended to be, it is the form of Christianity only and not the real thing. There would have been vastly more fruit here if the Wachowski's were Christians.
  Even the action scenes get a bit old by the third installment. The new stunts introduced in an attempt to make it innovative were sometimes rather silly-for example, the men of the Frenchman Merovingian have the ability to walk upside-down on walls. Maybe in some movies it could have been effective, but not in this one. Neo and Agent Smith both have acquired the ability to fly-and once again, in some other films this can be effective. Even a movie like Superman, with much inferior special effects, seems to use this better. Perhaps this is merely my bias against the bad parts of this film-which constitutes pretty much everything-but I'm not sure. I'm not going to see it again to find out.
  It does seem a good question: ""Why, why, Mr. Anderson, why get up?"" Why indeed? He might have done better just to stay in the mud.",1083196800,5,5588,4.621212121212121

But I found it to be thrilling, and amazing!  The plot was actually going somewhere, Neo had to rescue the people from the machines... so if people say there wasn't a plot, they're wrong and deceitful. :)
But anyway, the movie starts out intriguing, and I guess I'll just stop here, and let you watch the movie for yourself (if you haven't).  Yes, it is worth buying!!  I will probably buy it (and the soundtrack)!

At the end of the 2nd movie, we're left with interesting clues to how the Matrix came about, and it's clear that there is more to be revealed.  And what happens?  They ignore all of that in favor of an action movie that has no action and no suspense?  Why add on lame characters in an attempt to tug on our heartstrings?  After all of the interest and mystery of the Merovingian, Persephone, Agent Smith, Seraph, the Oracle, and the Keymaker in the 2nd movie, why abandon all of that for the last movie?  This could have been an interesting movie where they tie together the clues in the 1st and 2nd movie and paint a cohesive picture of the world of the matrix and how it came about.

1893228,3,B00009W2GQ,"Watching both sequels to The Matrix reminds me of something Harlan Ellison said in a review of the first Star Trek theatrical flick.  To paraphrase:  ""It's a good movie, but not a great movie; we needed a great movie.""  (Shades of Joe Biden at the Clarence Thomas hearings.)  As a professional philosopher, I found the quasi-philosophical musings shallow through most of both movies, but, in the end, Neo's ""I choose to"" (answering Smith's question as to why Neo should fight a seemingly hopeless battle) was a thinking man's knockout punch.  The battle sequence in Revolutions (in the Dock) was a slam-bang as well.  I was disappointed insofar as the ending seemed like a compromise, leaving the relationship between man and machine a bit muddled (this was foreshadowed, however, in Neo's conversation with Anthony Zerbe in Reloaded), but I suppose, in retrospect, a more simplistic American International Pictures 1950's-style, here-comes-the-army-to-kick-butt ending would have betrayed the series' open-ended questions.  I don't know; I'm still thinking about what I saw.  Maybe that's the point, eh?",1083196800,,1104,5.377906976744186
1893229,1,B00009W2GQ,"In fact, it's not even THAT good!!! I went to see in the theater, and there were four people aside from the other two people I was with. Two of them left 1/2 way through the movie, and I would place money that I heard one of the other persons there snoring. About 2/3  towards the end of the movie the other two people and me started making out loud jokes at the movie, and no one cared. In fact one of the guys in the back was even laughing. This has got to be the worst movie ever. I'm suprised it hasn't made it on Mystery Science Theater 3k already. I lost a dollar bet that it would be on that show before it hit store shelves...no not really, but that would've been a quick way to lose a dollar. After watching the first one, you think, ""Wow! That Neo guy is awsome! I hope he doesn't die."" Well bad news, he does. Almost everyone dies! Trinity, and a bunch of people in that human city place. If you have a choice between Star Trek convention, and seeing this movie, do the right thing and go to the Star Trek convention. If anyone was going to die I was hoping it'd be the 'all knoing Morpheus' but he ends up being just fine, so that sucks. He has got to be one of the most annoying movie characters to date, and that's including the Lion from The Wizard of Oz. Oh yeah, play Dark side of the Moon (Pink Floyd) with WoO to see something cool. Also if you play The Wall (Pink Floyd again) with Alice in Wonderland, it's even cooler. That's a better show than Revolutions. They should've stopped after the first one. Plus that animated thing was the most pointless thing ever. It was dumb and boring.

1893230,3,B00009W2GQ,"Coming from someone who bought a DVD player just so he could buy the Matrix DVD many years ago, this movie was far departure from the first Matrix.  With this installment, it seems the W. Bros became all too wrapped up in their world of Sci-Fi and Fantasy, and forgot where the Matrix came from.  The Matrix was born from both the inate human desire to understand human origin, and the need for a good summer movie.  It had it all: good story, great special effects, a hot sound track... Matrix Revolutions was born from the need to pack more special effects in than Matrix Reloaded.  And that's what it has: special effects galore.  Even the kung-fu seemed to be recycled.
My real gripe, however, is with the rediculous half-baked character interactions.  There are a host of new characters, few of which are really explored in the context of the matrix or the machine world.
I give it three stars because it's worth watching... but don't expect to be even remotely as impressed as you were with the first Matrix.",1083110400,4,1014,4.605555555555555

One slim hope would be that the final installment actually tie all the plot lines together and provide some insight into the philosophy that piloted the first two movies.  The first movie accomplished this feat in able fashion, the second with some turbulence and the third crash landed while boring a hole into the earth with its ineptitude.  I found it hard to watch this movie after the first 20 minutes.  I waited until the very end to see something redeeming; nope nothing worth while but a couple of meager scenes.
One comment had it right in that I could've cared less about any of the characters and the whole EMP being aboard the ships only was hideously stupid.  If the humans didn't make it in the matrix, I'd chalk one up for evolution.  They still might not make it based on one of the dumbest endings I have ever seen.

1893232,3,B00009W2GQ,"""The Matrix Revolutions"" seems to me to be a little better than ""The Matrix Reloaded"". Maybe this is because I resigned myself to believing that the third [and hopefully final installment] would be, like ""Reloaded"", all whiz-bang special effects and little substance. This turned out to be a correct assumption. But not expecting much in the story department allowed me to appreciate the visuals, which are awesome. Ironically, what rules the making of both ""Matrix"" sequels seems to be modern machinery; in this case, digital computers. Did the filmmakers see the irony? Modern machines dictate that special effects render plot and good scripting obsolete in movies about mankind's defeat by machines?
This episode continues the attack of the computers/machines on the human population, which has taken refuge underground. As the machines bore through the earth relentlessly in their attack on what's left of mankind. Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and the others continue to do their best to salvage the human race. Neo, after finally meeting the ultimate machine and proposing a truce, takes on the nefarious Agent Smith in a battle that goes on and on and on.
I think the `problem' with the sequels is rather simple. Commerce dictated that, since the original ""Matrix"" was so successful, sequels should be made. In any art form, often the original product is whole within itself. How could anyone paint a sequel to The Mona Lisa? The classic movie ""Casablanca"" ended with a question mark, but could a ""Part 2"" truly have gone any further? My conclusion is that, if commerce dictates sequels, so be it, but it is foolish of us to expect them to equal, much less to exceed, the original.",1082851200,5,1681,5.007142857142857

1893234,3,B00009W2GQ,"I wrote a review here when the movie came out in theaters. In that first review I gave Revolutions 3-stars, stating that in a theater this movie was tough to sit through, but I expected the DVD to be a better movie experience. And it was, for me. I'll give you an example (spoiler ahead)
Trinity has been run through by metal rods when they crash landed in the machine city. Trinity was impaled in four or five places. She should've been killed instantly, but she has something to say to Neo before kicking the bucket. She goes on, and on, and on to the point where you're ready to stand up and yell ""DIE ALREADY!"" at an important character that I should not want to see die, but at that point I just wanted the movie to be done already.
I watched the same scene here on DVD and when Trinity starts making her death-speech, I got up, went to the restroom, made myself a sandwich (ham and Swiss on wheat), got a Diet Coke out of the fridge, and then halfway from the kitchen to the TV, I changed my mind, went back to the kitchen and got a Diet Dr. Pepper instead. It was also hot in my house, so I got a class and some ice. When I sat down in front of the TV again Trinity was STILL dying. I'm not kidding, I swear it's true. But that's the cool thing about DVDs. We can get up, fast forward and even skip the whole chapter without ruining the movie-I mean we have ALL seen it already.
The movie is loaded, and reloaded (heh) with scenes like this. Scenes that may help illustrate the two creators' vision, but could have been much, much shorter. For many people this movie starts with Neo in the Train Station being told that ""Love is a word"", ""Karma is a word"", squawk, squawk, blah, blah. I swear I hate that program, and I'd have strangled him if I were Neo (of course if I had Neo's power in the Matrix, I'd never unplug). However, thanks to the control of DVD, for me the movie starts with Morpheus, Trinity and Seraph going to confront the Merovingian (sp).
It's tough for us reviewers here who are on the middle of the fence. I was terribly disappointed in the theater with this movie. I'm not going to re-hash what a thousand people here have said sucks about it, nor will I go into what people who thought it sucked didn't understand. I think different people simply have different taste in films, and how smart they are doesn't play into whether they liked The Matrix Revolutions or not. This is a question of taste which means one thing (wow I sound like the oracle): You have do decide for yourself. Rent it, rent it, rent it. It's well worth a rental if you haven't seen it yet.
Personally, I like this film here in my dvd player, right next to Reloaded. For me, both were better on dvd. I'm not saying Revolutions sucked- I'm not saying it's the best movie of 2003 (anyone who thinks that only saw one movie in 2003). This movie is much better at home, you can throw popcorn at the tv screen and tell that Indian program to shut up when he tells Neo ""Love is a word"", SHUT UP! I HATE YOU! You can't do that in a theater, and anything you find stupid about Revolutions you can declare proudly as if you were in an episode of Mystery Science Fiction Theater 3000. So the movie has flaws, and faults it has plusses too, and I hope nobody depends soley on internet reviews to make a decision about how they like this movie. Online, if you like it somehow you are in denial to the ones who didn't like it, and if you hated it then you are simply closed-minded and ignorant to the people who liked it. The internet is full of opinionated characters. Don't be influenced by opinionated people-see for yourself if the movie sucks or not.

The problem is that the Matrix Revolutions decided on the movie path of, ""Confusing = Brilliance"". This system which I will abbreviate as C=B is a common system that fails. Evangelion had to have a whole movie called ""End of Evangelion"" to please viewers who were conned into the C=B system. Matrix relies on confusing the viewer with a barrage of questions and such. Also, Reloaded had the architect. Did anyone take anything out of that? Was that the most unrelenting mumbo-jumbo crap you have ever heard? Be prepared for more as Revolutions serves up some of the most confusing crap that fails to be brilliant.
Let me go over this again. The effects are good. The action is somewhat okay at times because of this. The acting is crap though and the dialogue is cheesy. On top of that we have use of the C=B system. Avoid this movie as it will just insult you.",1082764800,5,1088,4.701570680628272
1893236,1,B00009W2GQ,"The Chairman's Rating: 2/10
This movie is Sanctimonious Tripe!
Just when you hoped that Matrix: Reloaded was a fluke, you find out that it wasn't.  It was the original Matrix that was the fluke.
This movie is the poster child for the 'WCS' award (Would'a, Could'a, Should'a).  No, correct that.  This one earns a special WCS Lifetime Achievement Award.
Everything that made 'The Matrix' the phenomenon it was (such that I use the reference Pre-Matrix and Post-Matrix when describing special effects or sci-fi thereafter) was missing from this movie.  Everything important, everything meaningful to the true Matrix storyline was either glossed over or run together in horribly placed soliloquies, as if to say, 'Get the storyline over with so we can get back to spending all of our $ on the special effects, Maaaan' (spoken with 70's hippie drawl)  To me, using special effects in film is akin to matching perfect wine (special effects) with the right food (storyline) .  The food (storyline) must come first and is the most important.  If the wine (special effects) is overbearing,  the entire experience falls flat.  The Wachowski brothers had two paths to go down after The Matrix: 1) true sci-fi storyline and a mind expanding plot, spiced with special effects; or 2) special effects to impress the 13 year-old kids to buy lots of stuff.  The chose the latter, and the viewers have suffered the consequences.
The few pieces of good storyline were totally overshadowed.  However, kudos to an admirable job by Mary Alice as the Oracle.  With the loss of Gloria Foster, Ms. Alice was given a tough role and given no script with which to work, she managed to pull it off.
With the exception of Neo, anyone really doing anything was non-white, female or both.  The true beauty/genius of The Matrix was that you never noticed race or gender.  The characters were written so well and performed so brilliantly by the cast that it made no difference at all.  I loved it and was hoping for lots more of the same in future releases, in essence eliminating stereotypes.  In Revolutions, the politically-correct stereotypes were jammed in the viewers faces constantly.
There were more cliches in this movie than sentinels. In the 'finest' Independence Day tradition: Tough, old grizzled
Marine yelling at the 16-year old kid, the 'Give 'em hell' speech, the kid 'saves the day', 2 chicks dishin' (rockets, that
is), Jada Pinkett ScreenKiller calling everything 'Baby'.  Jogging instead of running, while trying to escape pursuers?  C'mon, fake the running, at least, but jogging with flattened hands doesn't make anyone appear to be running faster.
And after seeing the inhabitants of Zion, all I did was arm-chair General and root for the machines.  I think the sentinels should have been outfitted with white gloves at the end of their tentacles, just so they could 'dope-slap' everyone in Zion.
With the choir music and doe-eyes at the mention of the name 'Neo', you can tell that they were hoping to start a belief system akin to the Jedi Knights of Star Wars, thereby propagating the series into lot$ of $ale$.
To top it all off, the 'Features' in the 2-CD set:
Links to Web sites (to $ell $tuff)
Matrix Comics (to $ell $tuff)
Matrix Tunnel Game (to $ell $tuff)
(BTW, the Matrix: Reloaded PC Game was rated by many as one of the worst games released in 2003.)
For an example of the reverse, take Tomb Raider.  Tomb Raider was a popular video game long before the movies came out.  So when the movies arrived, everyone knew to pretty much check your brain at the door, sit back and be entertained.  Both movies succeeded and were hits because we knew roughly what to expect.  Not so with The Matrix.  It was PRECISELY the LBI (Left the Brains In) Factor that so intrigued everyone in the first place.  To remove that intellectual aspect entirely was a total shock and much more of a letdown than if it were mindless to begin with
There is SO much wrong with this film that almost every scene deserves its own paragraph explaining the absurdity of ever putting it to film.
The horrid music pretending to be awe-inspiring
Castrated Morpheus
Jada Pinket ScreenKiller
Zion Council of Sanctimonious Do-Nothings
One line sums it up.  Agent Smith, after taking over the matrix and turning it dark, green and rainy, and turning all the people into replicas of himself, asks Neo: `So, how do you like what I've done with the place?'  Frankly, I loved it!
Just like Independence Day, this movie was Chinese food for the eyes, i.e. five minutes after watching it, you're hungry.  In fact, minutes after watching it, I was so ticked off that I immediately watched the first 35 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan'.  I had to flush this Matrix: REVULSIONS out of my mind and to do it I chose to watch people REALLY fighting, for the RIGHT reasons, for people WORTH saving.
Let's face it, Cypher was right all along. 'Why, oh why, didn't I take the BLUE pill?'  After the first Matrix, I ask myself (and the Wachowski brothers) the same thing.",1082592000,19,5019,4.788863109048724

There were still questions as to how the machines and humans would live together, no resolution for Morpheus and whats-her-name (Jaida Pinkett's character), we don't really know what becomes of Neo, and...well we don't really know a lot. Everything feels unresolved.
Other than the fact it direly needs a final chapter in the series, my only other complaint is that the directors seem to suffer from ""too much or too little"". In part 2, for instance, there were so many fight scenes as to become a bit dull after a while. (I'm sure we all recall that scene between Neo and a zillion Agent Smiths that dragged on long enough to call a few friends and read the daily paper before it ended.) Well in part 3, there are almost no fight scenes at all...and let's face it...part of the lure of The Matrix is in the out-of-this-world fighting scenes. Another thing there was too little of in part 3 was Morpheus. His John-the-Baptist to Neo's Christ in parts 1 & 2 was beyond great. In part 3, however, Morpheus is little more than wallpaper. For that matter, even Neo felt like wallpaper. The only one who really had me on the edge of my seat was Jaida Pinkett's character.
All those criticisms aside, I liked part 3 a lot more than part 2. Nothing, of course, can beat part 1. (But I'd sure like to put that theory to the test with a part 4 - and a Morpheus who is back to his old dynamic self.)",1082592000,,1747,4.378461538461538
1893240,5,B00009W2GQ,"Before I saw the movie, many of my friends tried to covinse me that this movie was the worst of the 3, and the the ending ""both sucked and blowed."" Thankfully, they were wrong. I think that the movie was horribly hyped, and through word of mouth became, supposedly, more disappointing than the Star Wars prequels(thank God the original trilogy is being released on DVD).
This final battle for the human race follows the story of Neo as he finds that his arch-enemy, Smith, has taken control of the Matrix and even poses a threat to the real world. In a desparete act to save the world, he must travel to the very center of the machines' city. Meanwhile, Morpheaus and crew try desperatly to reach the dock of Zion before the entire city is flooded with Sentinals.
The reason people didn't except the movie as anticipated was because the ending wasn't nessesarily the 'hero rides off into the sunset' type of ending. If people went in with a more open mind, it would have gotten many more good reviews that it got. In my opinion, this was a very deep and philisophical ending, and should be apriciated much more than it is.",1082592000,,1122,4.532019704433497
1893241,5,B00009W2GQ,"I really enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it and even more the second time through.
Revolutions takes place right after Reloaded so to many it would seem like the 3rd is more of a sequel to the 2nd, than the 2nd is to the 1st.  The movie starts of with Neo and whom everyone perceives to be Bane lying in a coma.
(If you paid attention in Reloaded, you will know, or at least have an idea that Bane's mind is actually Agent Smith's ""mind"")
After attempts to get Neo out of his coma Morpheus and others search the Matrix to see if his mind somehow got into the Matrix without being jacked in but do not find him.  They later find out from the Oracle that Neo is actually trapped between the Matrix and the real world.  Neo is eventually rescued and so begins the final chapter of the Matrix trilogy.  The machines have almost reached Zion and in the meantime Smith has taken over the entire Matrix.  THe humans must prepare for the final battle, while Neo discovers what he must do to save the human race.
Every scene in this movie was done almost perfectly.  Everything fit into place and Revolutions answered a lot of questions that we may have had at the end of Reloaded.  The storyline was excellent and well thought out.  I particularily enjoyed ""last stand"" of the humans versus the Sentinals at Zion.  Like nearly everyone else who saw this movie, I agree that the final fight scene between Neo and Agent Smith was spectacular.
As far as the acting goes, Hugo Weaving stole the show again portraying his role as Agent Smith.  In addition, Bane's character (played by Ian Bliss) absolutely nailed his role as the human form of Smith.  Eventhough it made a lot of sense when I thought about it, the fact that Smith actually came into the real world was jaw dropping in itself, but the acting from Bliss made this entire concept completely mind blowing.  From his demeanor to the way he expressed and emphasized his words, it really seemed like Hugo Weaving was in his body.
Without really giving away what happened in the end of the movie, all I can say is that it is a fitting and nessecary end to the Matrix trilogy.  If it ended any other way, then it wouldn't have seemed ""real""",1082505600,,2193,4.411910669975186
1893242,3,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix: Revolutions picks up right where The Matrix: Reloaded left off, so everyone is trying to figure out what happened to Neo (Keanu Reeves) and how to save him.  But when Neo finally gets out of the Matrix, he comes back changed and he has discovered some disturbing information that will force him to make some difficult decisions.  Neo finds that he can't even confide in Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) and that, although he is still The One, he doesn't quite believe that he can make a difference anymore.  After spending a lot of time alone, Neo comes to the conclusion that he must go up to the surface and fight the machines on the old battleground, not just through the matrix.  His other teammates try and dissuade him, but with Trinity by his side, Neo heads for the surface.  Little does he know that Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has a few surprises in store for him along the way...
Meanwhile, the rest of the crew heads back to Zion, all too aware that the fate of humankind may rest on their shoulders.  For while they are trying to avoid the machines on their way home, the machines are attacking Zion and are programmed to destroy every living thing that remains.  The inhabitants of Zion are not about to let their city go without a fight, however, and they use all of their old machinery and ammunition to try and keep the machines at bay.  The Council will do just about anything to buy Neo more time, because in these last desperate hours all they have is hope...
I thought that this movie was wonderful in some ways and a disappointment in others.  First off, I have to admit that I hated the ending.  I can't quite figure out if the directors were trying to leave the Matrix open for future sequels or if they just wanted to stay all mystical and let people draw their own conclusions.  I disagree with others, however, in that they say that the directors never answered any of their questions - the directors never made any plans to answer questions and from the outset it was obvious that the Matrix was always going to be a kind of shadowland that kept its own secrets.  Most of the special effects were still amazing, but I expected this and almost expected them to be even better because this was the third and final movie in the trilogy and it should have just knocked my socks off.  If anyone else had done the special effects, I probably would have been a lot more impressed, but the directors raised the bar so high with the first film that they were their own worst enemies.  I was also a bit disappointed that they relied so heavily on CGI instead of on stunt work because that was what made all of the fight scenes so cool.  This movie was also quite a bit drabber than the others because there was hardly any time spent in the Matrix and I have to admit that I missed all of the sweet outfits they used to wear there.  On the positive side, there were some great scenes in Zion as individuals fought hard to withstand the machines and one of my favorite characters was the Kid (Clayton Watson) who worshipped Neo and turned out to be a hero.  There were some touching moments between Link and his wife and Hugo Weaving, playing Agent Smith, was a great villain.  The sets were still incredibly imaginative and there were some fun one-liners as well, so there are some good parts to the movie.  All in all, I must admit that I enjoyed myself in the theatre and felt that it was money well spent, but it wasn't the spectacular finish that I had envisioned...",1082505600,2,3491,4.435054773082942
1893243,3,B00009W2GQ,"What happened to all of the the ideals of the first movie's quest for freedom? The ending of this movie just felt like all of the elements of the story simultaneously crashing down. Morpheus' role was reduced to being passenger in a long chase. Neo was inexplicably sent to the trainman's domain. Bane(Real world Smith) blinds Neo. Trinity is killed in a depressing scene, then Neo drudges on to finish (albeit in the awesome super burly brawl) his christ metaphor, which only leads to the half assed ending where humans are still in slavery, the only difference being zion will no longer be persecuted. I just walked away from this dissapointed, and after watching it again I still felt the same way... 6/10

1893246,3,B00009W2GQ,"I had been looking forward to the release of Matrix Revolutions having missed it in the theater. I enjoyed the first Matrix with its intriguing ""what if"" style plot and non-stop action.
Matrix reloaded departed a bit from that formula tending towards the metaphysical, psuedo-philosophical, ""greater mystery"" and profound trutch model, yet still keeping the style and mystery of the original.
Revolutions however trumped both in the action arena. It was in  many ways the ultimate man-versus-machine scenario.
What ruined it for me was the all nonsense masquerading as deep philosophy and all that shallow meaning of life crap.
The movie took itself way too seriously and I found it pretensious and not a little tedious. It looks to me like it played with intention of being difficult to understand as a substitute for depth. In reality if it was hard for some people to fathom it was because none of it made much sense.
If you filter out all the nonsense though and perhaps cut 30-40 minutes of claptrap out of it the movie would have been much better. Like when some fans cut many of the Jar-Jar Binks scenes from Star Wars I and made it a better tighter film.
If more of the Matrix had been left on the cutting room floor I think this movie would have been much better.",1082419200,3,1272,4.678571428571429
1893247,4,B00009W2GQ,"Let's get one thing straight:  ""The Matrix Revolutions"" has none of the reality-bending plot twists nor the eye-opening originality of the first.  The final chapter in the trilogy is an altogether different type of movie.  Although it cannot compete against the original, it competes strongly against other entries in the action/adventure genre.  With the requisite battle scenes that pit the underdog against a superpower, ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is a fast-paced, adrenalin-packed movie that owes its entertainment to action and special effects.  Despite this, the viewer must listen and watch carefully, as in the other two, to understand why events unfold as they do.
The plot is difficult to detail without spoilers since many of the most shocking revelations come at the beginning, before the high-stakes battle scenes begin.  Let it suffice to say that Neo has become something more than we thought, and as a result, he is much more of a threat to the nefarious virus Agent Smith.  When the Oracle indicates (or does she?) that Neo is Zion's only hope, he and Trinity break off from the others who are hunkering down for an all-out assault of Zion.  This is the strongest indicator that the third of the trilogy has stepped away from philosophical sci-fi and into pure action, as Neo and Trinity disappear from the screen for long stretches.  Their onscreen time is limited, as is their plot; this will disappoint many diehard fans.  Still, the action sequences are breathless (although eventually overdone) and the special effects are first-rate.  The resolution of the trilogy is both surprising and inevitable, the hallmark of a well-prepared story.  If you've been paying attention, it will make complete sense.
I recommend you approach this film without high expectations.  Comparing it to the first will only disappoint you.  Expect instead something along the lines of the ""Terminator"" movies, and you'll enjoy every minute.",1082419200,63,1938,5.189710610932476

1893251,5,B00009W2GQ,"Revolutions is the final chapter of a marvelous myth. Properly understood, we can appreciate that the Matrix Trilogy is the Wachowski brother's version of the story of enlightenment - the story of Self realization; the story of Consciousness transcending the dualistic smaller egoic versions of self that keep ""us"" preoccupied and transfixed short of the ONE. The brothers are synthesizers - they are telling their story blending references to all the traditions, but focusing on the common denominators that allow the traditions to be appreciated as a whole - as one truth. That's why the story has such ecumenical appeal. But this mixing of metaphors is also the source of much confusion, resulting in what I have often referred to as Matrix madness.
The confusion of Matrix madness, however, can be resolved by coming to some kind of coherent understanding as to what it is that the movie symbols symbolize. There are so many inter-related symbols that need interpreting; I doubt that anyone could map all of them to the original intent of the Brothers. And as with all metaphoric interpretations, the validity of the mapping is always driven by the personal context that the interpreter brings to the task. But there is one interpretive mapping that in my view is key to all the others, and that is this: the characters in the movie represent aspects of you, the viewer of the show. Humans represent human spirit, and map to the subjective / spiritual / intangible domain within you. Matrix programs represent brain based neural programs, and map to the objective / machinery / mecha domain within you. The movie is about you, the viewer - the witnessing Self. If one follows this line of representation, then it follows that the matrix is your mind; it re-presents the world as you experience it. The (three) cities are ontological worldviews; and the buildings and structures within the cities are aspects of your self and your psyche. Spirit meets mecha in the matrix of your mind. What's more, we see that the spirit and machine domains are correlated with each other - that one supports the other, that they are reflections of each other. The matrix world is your world; the world encoded in your mind. Meta-mental value laden soul ships hover in an abstract domain beyond the matrix and feed the matrix form `above', whereas evolutionarily derived mecha generated programs from the physical domain feed the matrix from `below'. Everything in our world and in the Matrix world is dualistic; opposites define each other. There is no left without right, no right without wrong, no good without evil, no ascent without descent. What's more, there is no spirit without mecha; no transcendent without an immanent; no Neo without A Smith.
Each of us has a notion as to the referent of the pronoun ""I"", but for most of us it's actually very difficult to define that notion using the tools of language. Nevertheless, body, mind and spirit do evolve in each of us as we grow in life. The movie viewer's worldview (sense of self) expands as the story unfolds to progressively encompass more characters, more cities and more complex relationships and tensions within and between them. The story is about how the warring dualities of these elements within you (the viewer) can ultimately be resolved, not by conflict, but by synthesis, allowing the many to become the ONE.
""Seeing"" this version of the Matrix may require some thinking, reflecting, and reading. It's not that easy to ""see"" or ""be"" the one. For those having difficulty (with Reloaded/ Revolutions) converting what seems like meaningless techno babble and trite dialogue or a rambling tale of kung fu fighting into a coherent story line about enlightenment, an open minded reading of just about any spiritual work with a mystical bent will definitely help. This is true because all such readings are also maps of the very same territory encoded in the Matrix. But to see all that the Matrix has to say, one needs to understand how the trilogy also embraces the scientific worldview in general and certain aspects of quantum mechanics in particular. The story is pointing towards a resolution of the (apparent) conflict between science and religion, between mecha and spirit, between ""its"" and ""I"". To see these issues through the Brother's eye/""I""s, one needs not only some familiarity with the interior of many religious traditions, but also at least a cursory understanding of postmodern philosophy, and a layman's working knowledge of quantum mechanics as it applies to duality, complementarity, causality, and choice. And yes, that may seem like a pretty big problem. But if you understand that the Matrix really does have you and all of us, and if you therefore want to understand what happened to a great story that perhaps seems at times to have lost its way - you may, in fact, wish to consider looking more closely into the whole rabbit hole of consciousness.
Two of the very best Matrix ciphers that I have found (and I believe there are many) include: A Brief History of Everything by Ken Wilber (or really almost anything that KW has written), and The Tao of Physics by Fritjof Capra. In that Wilber is a grand spiritual and philosophical synthesizer (integrator), and in that the brothers have (IMHO) quite the same intent, I believe that once you discover how to overlay Wilber's model/map of human consciousness onto that of the Trilogy, you will find that you can, indeed, decode the Matrix. Capra, in The Tao of Physics, presents an `enlightened' physicist's view of the same integrating principles, speaking to a realm of understanding and awareness that transcends duality in both the physical and spiritual domains.
All that having been said, might I suggest an alternative and simpler path to the appreciation of a beautiful story: review your own religious and philosophic traditions from a mystical perspective, learn a little something about numerology - then find and interpret EVERY number in the movie. Play with the implied punctuation in the movie dialogue. Pay attention to colors and color balance. And perhaps most importantly, think about the ""I""s (eyes) of each and every character. Then watch the DVDs very carefully, more than twice, and just try hard to see the Matrix for your Self.",1082246400,3,6281,4.965811965811966

1893255,1,B00009W2GQ,"Like many, I found the first Matrix to be an exceptional movie, ground-breaking in every respect.  Unfortunately, it seems The Brothers were too successful too fast.  They needed a good, strong producer, not Silver the circus-barker, to tell them they had lost the brilliant balance they showed in The Matrix.  Instead, we are treated to the immature, self-indulgence of a pair of boys who know little of the world, but think they know a lot.
Reloaded and Revolutions were big disappointments, technically and artistically.  Of the two, Revolutions is the worst.  I was actually bored, even with all the eye candy and pixels being splattered.  All the lead actors, even much-maligned Keanu, do yeoman work with the weak script and are to be commended for it, Weaving & Fishburne especially.
This movie shows that tons of money can make great special effects, but not necessarily deliver a great film.  Even with all the special effects, it was so obviously a video game in both look and story line, that it was painfully predictable.  The special effects were so over top that it was obvious that they were pixels dying for our entertainment.  Militarily, the last battle is set-up so stupidly that by the end I was rooting for the machines, since the humans were taking such stupid and indefensable positions.  That battle would have benefited from a little knowledge of military strategy and tactics.
The storyline becomes so sophomoric as to be humorous.  The brothers seem determined to show how educated and culturally aware they are.  Instead they demostrate their shallowness with the cafeteria-style philosophy.  Cornell West shows why he is where he is, and fits in perfectly with The Brothers and these films...  Lot's of buzz words thrown around by a very good  grifter.
Rarely have sequals been so bad that they ruined the original movie so much that I wished they'd never been made, but that's Reloaded/Revolutions.  A mature, strong writer might have been able to take the script of these two movies and make one strong one.  Instead, The Brothers put themselves into competition with Peter Jackson and embarassed themselves.
After LOTR, Master & Commander, Gladiator, and We Were Soldiers, we know it's reasonable to expect a great story, great acting AND great effects in an action movie.  Reloaded/Revolutions might have cut it 10 years ago, but not now.
If you've only seen the original Matrix, don't buy this DVD, don't rent it.  Same for Reloaded.  If you've seen Reloaded you may as well see this one, but it's like an autopsy.",1082246400,7,2548,4.950588235294117
1893256,5,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions. perhaps one of the most unfairly maligned film of the past few years? perhaps the most misunderstood film of the past few years? Certainly, and much more. What we have here is a case I will never understand. First of all, obviously, the special effects are phenomenal, perhaps the greatest ive ever seen this side of LOTR. Its jaw dropping to be frank. The siege of Zion is monstruous and the final showdown is one huge kick that frankly just flat out rocks. Ok now thats out of the way. Let me discuss the main reason I love these 2 sequels so much and why I hold them in the same regard as the original Matrix. The story is in my opinion flat out fantastic. period. you cant have a decent and engrossing science fiction film without a compelling story. and Reloaded and Revolutions delivered that in spades. From the discovery that Neo is but a pawn in the overall scheme of the machines, to the fact that Zion is nothing more than a physical matrix to its inhabitants, these 2 films gave a plot twist so huge in my opinion it ranks up there with the original planet of the apes. Youll have to look at the first film in a whole new light. Many complained that Revolutions did not answer any questions and gave a cop out ending. This is pure and simply FALSE. The answers are there but not explicetly spelled out, The death of smith DOES make sense, Neos powers ARE explained (and possibly reference earlier in Reloaded) and the ending is in no way a copout and has been forshadowed since the animatrix. In Revolutions they make theire point that despite the differences, both man and machine deserve theire life and forshadow the conclusion. Peace is the only solution. I will say I was a little dissapointed that the character of the merovingian was not fleshed out more but thats about it in terms of problems with the overall plot. Overall the film is very well done, the Score by Don Davis is fantastic and SHOULD have at least been nominated for an Oscar. The script is probably the weakest of the three films, I have to admit if only for the inclusion of several ""cheesy"" lines and a drawn out death scene, which despite that still works well. The acting is what youd expect from the films, on the same level as the first two movies, though keanu Reeves does a decent job outside his usual unsure personality routine which is pretty much what Neo is. Hugo Weaving as always is excellent. He delivers some particularly good stuff here including a great exchange with the oracle and a tremendous final monologue. Special mention to Ian Bliss who played Bane who did a great job of playing the real world Smith. Totally surprised me.  Anyways, like I said, this movie does not deserve the harsh reviews it got last year, and many reviewers are now pointing that out. But hey lets remember many sci fi classics were maligned themselves, for example, Blade Runner....
In the end all I can say is watch all 3 films. Get rid of any preconceived notions, forget the ridiculous hype just watch all 3 films and appreciate what the Wachowski brothers have done. The first truly exceptional science fiction trilogy of our time. Lucas dreamed it, but these guys actually did it and much much more. Take it from a huge science fiction fan and as a film fan. These movies deserve theire place as one of the great sagas.

But not a movie.
I am soooo tired of people being enthusiastic about plain crap!
No doubt the trilogy comes to an end.
No doubt a lot of work went into it.
The best of it is its music (I mean the original score).
The rest is at best forgettable.
It stems from a contorted mind of a spoiled child, who had too many ecstasy pills, acid, or some other fluffy stuff snorted up its nose.
The best of the three remains the original ""The Matrix"".
It had an original story which made perfect sense and which was refreshing in its plot twists.
But ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" are both plain stupid and unnecessary sequels, only produced to create a trend or a fashion and therefore make money out of gullible people.
Perhaps it is just me who finally sympathizes with Agent Smith, rather than with the wimpy Neo.
I never understood the fascination with a Messiah or for a ""chosen one"", which I find utterly dull and diminishing for the human race as thinking, breathing and creative individuals.
This is perhaps why Germans followed a Bohemian corporal, to be their leader in the '30s.
Nevertheless, the sequels are an offence to any well-read individual, who knows something about classic literature, mythology, theology, philosophy and above all, Wagner's tetralogy, created from the ""Nibelungenlied"".
There is a mass of cross-cultural, cross-religious and cross-mythological references and deja-vus in them, that my head started to spin in disbelief.
From Lewis Carroll's own ""Alice in Wonderland"", to Nitsche's ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" and from Greek and German (or Nordic if you like) mythology to far eastern Bhuddism and Zen beliefs, through a good dose of theatrics borrowed from ""The Ring of the Nibelungen"", anything goes here.
Anything, but true imagination and original creativity.
In comparison, the other trilogy, taken from Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" is far better, far more entertaining than this monstrously over-stretched MTV-clip.
I simply cannot understand that mature people can even contemplate these as movies.
They are just another fine example of Barnum & Bailey's Circus of special effects, nothing more.
But then again, in this computerized world, taste is a matter of the beholder: usually that of a machine, not that of a thinking human being in flesh and blood.
No wonder then, that there are already some nuts out there, who are willing to allow electronic implants to be inserted in their bodies, if not directly in their brains...
Why not become machines ourselves?
We are so afraid of ageing and about the notion of death, that we would sell our souls to live forever.
But be careful what you wish for, you may get it.
The only glitch is, will eternal life truly be what one expects it to be?
What if, instead of eternal life in health and prosperity, everything gets turned around, and you are forced into a life of mysery, sickness and doom?
Would you still want to live forever?
And now back to these movies, which would have been far more interesting, if they had followed this train of thought, rather than going into a limbo of action-packed mayhem, only slightly dusted with some messianic philosophy, and peppered with a lot of mythological revisitations.
In my view, and believe me when I say so, they are just a waste of money and time.
Still I own them all. You may wonder why.
Well, I expected a truly fascinating continuation to the first and best one and instead, ""Reloaded"" was just that: reloaded.
Then I thought to myself, oh well, the middle section of a story is never so enticing as the first, so let's see how it ends, and alas to my stupor I was confirmed what I feared the most: the second was truly just the first part of the third.
Still I am thinking: is it possible that we are so stupid as to allow machines to rule us, or worse, that we will regress so much in our intelligence, as to allow the domination of machines over us?
Using a tool or a machine for our convenience is not a bad thing, but to allow it to monopolize who we are, what we think or what we do, that's truly evil.
Perhaps, this is the true and final message of the Warchowski Brothers, but this is just my guess and I doubt that if such a thing would happen, a Messiah would rise to save us.
No intelligent being would ever save a race of idiots, who have relinquished their freedom for some opportunistic comfort.
Especially not a Divine being at that!
I gave it, them, 2 stars, just because of the effort made, but if I were you, and still interested in buying a Matrix movie, I'd stick to the original one and would just forget that it is part of a trilogy.
It stands pretty well on its own.
My apologies go to all those I may have offended by my harsh words, but I had to vent my thoughts on these products, which to me are still not worth to bear the name of movie.
If you like entertainment of this sort, but by far more sophisticated and not so trashy, I'd recommend the two X-Men movies.
Now, there's a couple which can rightfully be called movies.
Even though based on Comic strips, they have something that Matrix lacks: humanity.
Beautiful imagery, excellent and convincing acting, beautiful music (far from the hammering and monotonous music of Don Davis), and special effects that match the eye.
If ever, then try to rather get hold of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which I have mentioned before. It is far more entertaining and refined than this ""Gothic-Art"" comic nonsense.
And if again, you must have something gothic, but with a sense of taste, get hold of all Tim Burton's movies, including Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow and so on and so forth. They are all filled with a strange poetry, while dealing with rejects of society.
But stay away from ""The Matrix"", at least from number two and number three.
This is a friendly advice.
It's up to you now.",1082160000,10,5860,4.651880424300868
1893259,1,B00009W2GQ,"I watched Re-Loaded in the theater and was overcome by the amount of psycobabble that I could not enjoy the action. When this came out on DVD, I decided I liked it. It was not really that bad, except for the ""to be continued.""
Then came Revolutions. I had high hopes for this. I wondered how it would end because I had this idea that what was concidered the ""real-world"" was actually another extension of the Matrix. I think that would have made a great ending. Anyway, I watched the movie and quickly became dissappointed and bored. Halfway in the movie, no progress was made to reveal the plot, then the seemingly endless battle of Zion takes place.
SPOLIERS AHEAD:
I have to admit the ending of the movie caught me by surpize. Having Neo make a deal with the machines shows that third option that was not present in Re-loaded. Non the less, there is no reason why this film could not have been merged with Re-loaded. In summary, what is wrong with Revolutions
1. No plot development during the first half of the movie
2. The Zion battle sequence was much too long and kind of over the top.
3. Trinity and Neo die. I understand Neo dying, but what was the purpose of Trinity dying? Cannot figure that out! I would think her seeing the Sun then returning to Zion will offer hope to the humans.
4. I can't help but loose pace with the different body of the Oracle. Yes they tried to cover this in the script, but it did not work for me.
5. I miss the twins. Those guys were cool!
6. What is with the fight scene between Smith and Neo? That was way too ""video gamey"" to me. Kinda silly actually.
What is right with Revolutions:
1. It does end eventually.
2. I bought it at Amazon, so I saved a few bucks.
3. If I cannot sleep at night, I'll put this on.
4. If someone I dislike asks me for a movie recommendation, I will recommend Revolutions.

The first Matrix rocked - an amazingly original storyline, great dialogue and a great blend of sci-fi with martial arts. Not this time. This final sequel, Matrix Revolutions, is garbage - basically a souless two hour video game cut-scene. It has a lousy, confusing script with too much emphahsis on over-blown-budget visuals. This is one of the the worst movies I have ever paid money to see. The storyline stinks and the stupid, ambivilent ending is an absolute insult to fans of the original film.

It may not present anything new in terms of ideas or lead to you ask and ponder the answer to any questions as the first ""Matrix"" may have done, but it's a pleasantly entertaining popcorn flick, with at least two or three truly entertaining sequences -- one involving the Sentinels entering Zion and causing death and chaos within, and Neo's battle against Agent Smith on a rain-soaked city street. The third scene isn't surprising for its actions or thrills, but because, for arguably the first time, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss show something resembling emotion in their main scene together -- Neo is blinded and their ship crashes, and Neo crawls over to Trinity and Trinity tells him that she's not going with him -- he asks why, and then feels several large metal rods have impaled her body.
The only weaknesses I found were that the characters of Ghost (Anthony Wong) and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) were greatly underused, especially Ghost -- who is seemingly not used at all (seems like he even had more time in ""Reloaded"" where he had little). But then I guess the ""Enter the Matrix"" videogame is meant to fill in for his and Niobe's small roles in the films. Link (Harold Perrineau) also goes largely unused here -- his wife Zee (Nona Gaye) gets more of the screen time -- but after the somewhat touching moments they had in ""Reloaded"" I expected more of their story in the finale. But aside from these small quibbles, the film's popcorn-munching entertainment, and only the hardest critic will not be biting their nails seeings swarms of thousands and thousands of Sentinels wreaking havoc in Zion.",1082160000,,1854,4.778816199376947
1893262,1,B00009W2GQ,"Minor ""spoilers"" ahead - although you shouldn't care..
The Wachowski brothers have taken The Matrix - the most original sci-fi movie in many years - and in two movies made it into the worst, most cliched sci-fi trilogy ever. The first Matrix looked really cool and the faux-philosophy was kept to a minimum. Then the movie made millions and the writer/director brothers let it go to their heads. The second movie thought it was intelligent, but was really just a bunch of psycho-babble-jibberish and repetitive action sequences. The third movie manages to forever ruin the reputation of the franchise, as it is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie made me want to die in the cinema - except when I was laughing at the crap dialogue. Was I the only one who nearly died laughing when that stupid kid says he hasn't finished the training program?? THIS MOVIE SHOULD APPEAR IN THE DICTIONARY UNDER ""CLICHE"". It should also be under ""annoying"" and ""plot-hole"" - I wanted that stupid general guy to die more than anything in the world, he kept getting angry when people did things to save the stupid city for god's sake! And what was with the Dragonball Z ending?!? Has Keanu become Goku as well as Jesus? Speaking of Jesus, the cross-shaped glow that emitted from Reeves at the end was pathetic - just like the ending. Maybe the W-Bros could have explicitly stated that you need to ""believe"" or ""have faith"" a few more time just to REALLY drive it home. At the end I expected to see a message thanking the church for funding. I won't even go into how this movie has unconvincing and over-used CGI, bad acting, every generic action movie plot point you've seen 100 times already and the worst soundtrack ever. I hated those stupid mechwarrior things, I hated all the characters, especially the stupid guy who you see screaming in his mech for about 10 minutes total and I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE. It really is terrible. If you liked the first Matrix and want to keep it that way, never come within 100 feet of ""Revolutions"". This movie is a crime against humanity.",1082160000,12,2090,4.636118598382749

You see, this is the kind of movie that must be watched again and again to be appreciated. I have a short attention span so I don't watch many movies twice--let alone again and again. My point is this: If you paid attention to the first two movies you got the impression that the Human Race was screwed a long time ago. If you watched The Animatrix they spelled it out for you. The Machines had won and no rebellion by a few thousand humans was going to make any difference. Neo or not. The Matrix Revolutions ended the story in the only way believable--which the rules say I can't reveal here. If you saw the movie in the theater once, buy or rent the DVD and watch it again.

1893265,5,B00009W2GQ,"Having just written the OED on ""Revolutions"" (the ""Big Picture"" a phrase my retirement from business exempts me from most gratefully; you've no idea how many execs nearly became castrati because they wouldn't stop blithering cliches...), I realize I left out some details.
First: Larry Fishburne (that's what he called his sixteen year old self on ""Apocalypse Now"") brings is classy classicim to a role that could have easily given vent to an actor's worst temptation to overact (for an example of overacting, see Diane Sawyer's attack piece, er, interview with Mel ""I Made 300M bucks and you can kiss my..."" Gibson.
He brings the gravitas of Henry II (whom he's played on Broadway) and the humanity of the best of officers compounded with the desperate dedication of the fanatic.  A bravura performance.
Jada Pinkett Smith brings a gritty, edgy performance to balance Neo's omnipresent calm exterior.  I found her performance most enjoyable.  She really made me believe she was piloting a hovercraft down a tiny maintenance shaft.  Even with the age difference, I saw some real chemistry between her and Fishburne, age difference not withistanding.
Captain Roland is played wonderfully as the frustrated commander who knows he's in over his head yet refuses to recognize it.  Fine acting.
Finally, the man who played Bane has not received his critical due.  The fan reviewer who pointed out his mastery of Weaving's gestures was dead on the money.  But it was more uncanny than that.  It shows an eye for detail, for he captures not just Smith's vocal and facial expressions, but his gestures and body language; even the contempt seems Smith's.  I hope we can expect big things from this actor in the future.
""The Siege"" is one of the best of a spate of intense battle scenes from the last decade plus, from Omaha Beach in ""Private Ryan"", to the ""final"" confrontation in ""The Patriot,"" to the final shootout in ""The Usual Suspects"" to the two big heist scenes in ""Heat,"" the entrance in to the hell of German-occupied Stalingrad at the beginning of ""Enemy at the Gates.""  Those were even more overwhelming because something very much like them (we can forgive Dean Devlin's ignorance of the rolling fire technique used by British platoons instead of the ""all at once"" volleys we see in ""The Patriot""; this gave the Brits the advantage of pouring constant fire into enemy lines--as they did to Old Guard at Waterloo--who had to stop, unload, en masse and then fire en masse; the British weren't the best soldiers in Europe for two hundred years for nothing!).
Yes ""The Siege"" is stunning, overwhelming.  But how else could an attack by a quarter million murderous robots be?
Never look for reasons to hate a work of art.  If that's what you're doing, then you're running an agenda, not appreciating art.  If you don't like it, fine.  Cogetn criticism can make even the dedicated fan appreciate his favorite work of art.  But in this case, there is too much good and too little bad for the latter to matter.

1893269,2,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix series started out so promising -- the 1st chapter was such a unique idea that the potential directions for sequels were exciting & virtually limitless.  The bizarre direction that the Wachowski brothers chose for Reloaded & Revolutions is just baffling.  Call me an idiot if you want because it's probably true, however, I know a stinker when I see one.
In Reloaded, we were treated to much more of the outstanding visual effects that were started in The Matrix, but after watching Reloaded for awhile, the movie started to become stale as if the story were really going nowhere.  Then came the scene with the architect.  How many people, in a theater full of people, could focus on, comprehend, and process the mind-numbing gobblty-goop spewing from his word-hole that was apparently important to the storyline?  Sure, you can follow his speech better while sitting at home watching the DVD, but is that why you go to the movies? To wait for the DVD?
While Reloaded was just o.k., it was a gem compared to Revolutions.  With this movie, I feel that the series truly went down in flames.  The 1st half-hour of the movie involved the gang trying to rescue Neo from some sort of ridiculous virtual train station that had nothing to do with this movie or the series as a whole.  Why was this put in the movie at all?  Well, the continuous, non-stop, and boring fight scene that made up the rest of the movie only lasted 90min, so they obviously needed some filler material.  The extended apocalyptic battle between Neo & Smith was so over-the-top that I started laughing, but even this short-lived amusement faded after the scene went on for another 40 min.  The battle for Zion was actually alright, if too long, and the scenes above the surface in the machine city were interesting as well.  However, the ending to the movie and the series was abrupt and unsatisfying, leaving very little closure for people who have been big fans of the Matrix series.

Also things are still not fully explained about Smith exploding. The Wachowski Brothers allude to solutions but people are still confused about the ending. One person that i know actually thought the Matrix blew up!
Anyway the DVD itself is better then the movie. The picture is great and the menus are as good as Reloaded.

1893272,5,B00009W2GQ,"The beginning scene of `The Matrix Revolutions' initially parallels that of its illustrious predecessors: a torrent of falling code fills the screen, representational symbols trickling down from a higher `source' to the innumerable mediaverse-enslaved masses below.  Then, abruptly, the code vanishes and the screen explodes with golden fractals, revolving the mathematical patterns of the universe itself.  After this moment of celestial concentration, we return to the symbols, which form a dual `7' before revealing the skyscraper gridlock of the Matrix's main hub; the camera pans away to expose the ritualistic design of the nucleus: a daemonic glyph, symbolizing the oppression inherent within this vast energy-siphoning illusion-prison.  The glyph is quickly subsumed in the rain of code, lost amidst so much sprawling cipher - yet still there, beneath the surface, controlling the overall construct.
In my Amazon review of the Matrix Reloaded, I called the second film a ""clockwork onion"" due to its tightly woven core of theme, plot-twist and multiple subtext, with more and more layers stripping away once the viewer made a conscious effort to penetrate the surface-pleasures of melodrama and CGI impossibility.  *The Matrix Revolutions*, though more overtly spiritual than cerebral in its references and replay-benefit, continues this innovative story-form, climaxing the rising war between man and machine and giving satisfying conclusion to the multiple arcs incorporated in the first two films.  The answers are here, but they are not in any way _obvious_; often a subplot or mystery is resolved by a few words of dialogue or a visual cue.  Like the preceding films, *Revolutions* is a riddle wrapped in onion-layers of ambiguity, and what one puts into the film - negative or positive, intellectually or instinctually - will be what one derives from it in turn.
The Story: Revolutions begins right after Reloaded cut off.  Trinity learns that Neo is trapped in the Matrix.  She must commence her mythological hunt, fighting through Hel itself to confront his captor.  Zion, meanwhile, establishes its defense against the incoming sentinel army, equipping rank after rank of brutally efficient Mechs to combat the encroaching machines.  The people of Zion aren't going to be exterminated without a fight, and man, woman and child shall battle to their dying breath to preserve the last human refuge.
The Spectacle: The Battle of Zion is easily the most powerful and epic sci-fi carnage extravaganza this side of Hoth.  Intense and very long, it lashes the nerves with incredible imagery and an astonishing command of sound - the snubbing of *Revolutions* at the Oscars (not even a friggin' nomination!) just goes to show that there ain't no (aesthetic) justice in this world! As for the Superbrawl... what I loved most about this sequence is the combination of metaphor with violence: the truest ""clash of the titans"" ever committed to film, in both overarching theme (0/1, the Dance of Shiva) and pure popcorn impossibility.
Of course, the meme was out on Revolutions, even before its general release, and the movie was quickly dubbed a `failure', a `dull cacophony,' a `dismal, smoldering franchise-ruin' as professional critics leapt en masse at the chance to rip the film, complaining paradoxically of its `confusing nature' and its `hollowness,' all in all reminding me of reactions to other, similarly revolutionary artists: of the famous critique of `The Abduction from the Seraglio': ""Too many notes, my dear Mozart;"" of an 18th century news-rag proclaiming Beethoven's `Pastoral' Symphony to be ""profoundly unsatisfactory"" (!); of Stravinsky causing a literal riot with the unveiling of his pagan masterpiece The Rite of Spring (...not unlike the reaction to Revolutions at a certain New York premiere, from what I've heard).  How times change, how they stay the same! Genius *challenges* the craft, and is *always* attacked for its ambition.  Case in point: the Matrix trilogy has been reviled for its cold, cerebral cinematic approach, roasted on the critical coals for _daring_ to investigate the basic quandaries of philosophy and paradigm-structure; even if the W. bros. don't succeed one hundred percent of the time, there seems to exist a ""glass half-empty"" mentality about the attempt - absolute perfection or utter failure, no middle-ground whatsoever - and all of it sounding like the upset bleating of the under-educated and/or those unwilling to make any serious undertaking into the sources the W. Bros. reference.  Regardless of such sour grapes, these movies are here, and here to stay.  As a society we need more intelligent, thought-provoking films: happily, the law of cultural megamass predicts more and more sophisticated measures of communications to come.  But there is always resistance to change.  Thus the negative miasma that surrounded *Revolutions* upon release: a desperate-sounding din of the ""paid opinion"" eagerly competing with one another for the snappiest put-down, the catchiest one-liner, cloaking profound ignorance with clever superficiality.
Well, whatever.  What I enjoy most about The Matrix franchise are the multiple levels of humanistic conception interwoven with the pulp action and solemn drama (this is a war movie, after all).  Truly a _world_ blockbuster, *Revolutions* incorporates the core elements of every major belief system, subtly exposing how the myriad `ways' of spiritual ritual point towards the same goal, the same construct of perceptive *need* and *fulfillment*.  More than ever before in our history, these similarities must be recognized and accepted, or our species will be reap the catastrophic seeds realized by last centuries' technological advancements.  The message of *peace,* of attempting a mutual-beneficial relationship with our neighbors, must be at least attempted if we are to advance into a prosperous future.
In short: This trilogy is the first cinematic mythology of our viral ""post""-modern era, a mirror-reflection of our crazy careen into the murky depths of the 21st century...and as for those last few moments, so beautiful and so, so misunderstood... I was awestruck by the masterful blend of Hindu cosmology at its new-epoch threshold with the theme of symbiotic evolution, the necessity of reciprocal growth.  Absolute genius.

Part 1: Birth, Part 2: Life & Part 3: Death, thus these are what represent the feelings of each movie...(Notice how Matrix 2 it's just mayham, everyone doin there thing frantically trying to get all there missions done, left, right & center: THATS LIFE IN GENERAL, & notice how matrix 3 is alot DARKER & more evil & depressing than part 1 & 2: THATS REPRESENTING DEATH, THUS: TRAGEDY!!!) Yeah, its complex, but thats no reason to slag it off DAMMIT! & if u pass it off as ""THIS IS WAK DUE TO IGNORANCE: Just die! Shouts out to the person who said this: {Superb Trilogy, April 12, 2004
 Reviewer: A viewer from Anchorage, Alaska United States
What happens when you bring an intellectual movie trilogy to be viewed by the public? You get a bunch of unintellectual people criticizing the movie for its action e.t.c} Right on! Long live the king......",1081728000,8,1320,4.689655172413793
1893277,5,B00009W2GQ,"Partly because it's now possible to watch the entire trilogy and keep track of what's going on, pausing and replaying as needed to catch all the little things. (You'll never run out. This is _Finnegans Wake_ for cybergeeks.) At any rate the quality of the DVD release is terrific, sound and video both. (The 'extras' are nice too, but I generally don't buy DVDs because of that stuff myself.)

I said last November, and I say again, that the critics (and viewers) who thought the trilogy declined in quality after the first movie are very much mistaken. I think they just didn't grok what the first movie was about and therefore had inappropriate expectations about the latter two.

For the record, the theme of the entire trilogy is the relationship between humans and machines/computers/programs -- _not_ 'What is real?'. That question was an important subtheme in the first movie, but it was _only_ a subtheme.

Nor does the philosophical stuff take a back seat to the action in _Revolutions_. It's still there, although there are a couple of places where you may have to dig a little harder to find it.

Nor is the ending 'Hollywood'. The humans aren't the 'good guys' and the machines aren't the 'bad guys'; the resolution at the conclusion of the trilogy involves the next step in the symbiotic evolution of _both_ 'sides', and not everybody from either side will be going along.

Nor, despite all the philosophical stuff, is the purpose of the trilogy to take or expound a philosophical position. This series is a huge, cosmic-scale exercise in mythmaking. The Wachowskis want to tell a _really cool story_ -- the story of a new hero named Neo. _Everything_ else is in the service of this story.

Beyond that, I ain't gonna tell you a thing. Watch the movie(s) carefully and figure it out for yourself. The Wachowskis have kept the religious, philosophical, and other references coming right up until the spectactular finish, and they've deliberately left some things ambiguous and open-ended. (Probably not as many as you think, though.)

Matrix 7.0 will be whatever the users make of it. But if you'd like to be one of the users, watch these films quickly; it's almost impossible to free a mind after a certain age.",1081728000,2,2224,4.821522309711286
1893278,5,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions fulfilled all my expectations as a non-conclusion to this brilliant postmodernist trilogy. It is actually quite unbelievable that a Hollywood studio could actually have produced such a brilliant movie. In fact the self congratulatory web of fluff productions, pandering critics and mindless movie going drones that is corporate American cinema very rarely lets anything like this slip through. This move is brilliant on so many levels and this is difficult to convey in words. People should experience the movie and all its 'petit ecrits' themselves. However I can reveal that the visual language of the Wachowskis is absolutely brilliant in this film and is in fact reminiscent of the great Fritz Lang at his best. However I can understand the backlash this movie has created since the multicultural and nonhierarchical philosophy of the Matrix movies threatens, like all postmodernism, the patriarchal war mongering WASP society's enslavement of the world.
It is also clear that the ability to read and connect signs is rapidly diminishing, at least in the Western World. Most reviewers, even the professional ones, seem to have grasped only a insignificant portion of the multitudes of visual signs floating around in this movie. I think the trilogy would actually have been better understood a hundred years ago despite all its postmodernism.",1081728000,3,1369,5.342592592592593
1893279,2,B00009W2GQ,"The third and --ye gods!-- most boring of the ""Matrix"" movies. I wasn't wild about the first ""Matrix"" film, but was pretty much on board after seeing #2, considering it a fine, fast-paced, pleasantly pseudo-profound, comicbooky action film. And while this installment started off with a promising action-packed nonchalance, it quickly devolved into a loud, flimsy, poorly plotted morass. Of course, no one needs little old me to tell them about this flick's shortcomings: fans of the series deserted New Zion in droves after this turkey was released... But I still had to check it out and see for myself.  Oh, well.  By the way, Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinty, Canoe's love interest, is one of the least interesting screen actors I have ever seen.  Big flaw in the casting there, which helps drag the series down on a number of occasions.",1081728000,,842,4.915492957746479
1893280,2,B00009W2GQ,"The third installment to the Matrix trilogy, Matrix Revolutions, is extremely disappointing.  The first movie was a surprise hit for me an maybe one reason why I liked it so.  My wife, the computer genius in the family wanted to see the first movie, and I kept on going back and seeing it again and again.  It had a nice plot despite certain flaws.  It messed well with the look of the film and provided a backdrop to make the action scenes believable.  Reeves was sharp and Fishburn was enjoyable.  By the end of the second movie, Fishburn was a little pretentious, but still the movie was enjoyable enough even if it didn't know when to quick.
The directors should have quit then, because the third installment is quite frankly a bore.  The action scenes are generally way too long.  They should have probably taken the last hour of this movie, knocked out about 45 minutes of ""Reloaded"" and finished the movie up in the second installment.
Despite the C++ theory (computer trying to solve the anomaly), the metaphysical elements, and the Christology themes (Neo bearing the machine world -sins- into him to bring peace to humankind) this last movie of the trilogy does not provide enough spark or interest for the viewer.  Our imaginations about this world and how it would end far exceeded those of the founders of this story.  The pace of the film is too long and the dramatic elements missing.  Fishburn, who was great in the first movie and only mildly effective in the second, is really inconsequential in this one.
There are too many pretentious and obvious speeches.  The special effects are nice, but can only carry a movie so far.  Reeves is actually stale and his strongest performance was by far in the first and second movie.  Lastly, Moss does a fine job but cannot overcome a failed script.
A great disappointment to potentially what could have been one of the greatest trilogies ever.  Instead, we will forever be reminded that what was a great first movie is ruined by a disastrous final movie.  If there was a Matrix, I would load-jack the third movie in the abyss and give these directors another chance.
The last fight scene between Smith and Neo is mildly entertaining and commander Jason's character is better flushed out and he appears less one deminsional as he did in ""Reloaded.""",1081728000,4,2306,4.713216957605985
1893281,4,B00009W2GQ,"I was mesmerized by the first Matrix film when I saw it for the first time.  As were many, I sat confused for a large portion of the film until I more fully understood what ""The Matrix"" was supposed to be...namely, an artificial world created by machines to enslave the human race into unknowing servitude while their bodies produced the precious energy needed to power the machines.
When I approached the first of the two inevitable sequels, I was a little put off by the increasingly complex world that was portrayed there, a Matrix that seemed intensely manipulated by ""programs"" disguising themselves as human beings inside the Matrix.  Where the first film focused on the human struggle to free their minds of the Matrix, this second offering seemed to simply the premise that the Matrix was more of a romping ground for dissadent programs with their own personal agendas.  Still, being an installment akin to the first film, I would say that I enjoyed ""Matrix: Reloaded"" as a whole.
This third, seemingly disjointed conclusion to the series, trivializes the characters ever more, reducing the Matrix to a rapidly disintegrating world controlled by corrupt programs whose agendas are more than just played out, but rather, seem to dominate the Matrix.  Further, the story relies heavily on its principal character, Neo (Keanu Reeves) as a sort of ""Deus ex Machina"" (or God Machine (no pun intended)) to wrap the story up and bring closure to a series that really had no viable ending.
The premise is that Neo, the One chosen to save the matrix, is actually capable of sliding his consciousness between the waking ""REAL"" world, and the fabricated world of the Matrix.  In ""Reloaded"" we are left with a cliffhanger ending which leaves our hero in an unexplainable coma after he manages to project his consciousness into a group of ""sentinels"" that are attacking his ship, the Nebacanezzar.
With the discovery of this new power, Neo realizes (though its never explained how) that he must ultimately travel to the machine city to attempt to bring an end to the war.  Meanwhile, things are amiss back in Zion, the human home city, as the sentinels have been drilling their way into the city, and have begun an assult that will potentially wipe humanity clean off the map.
The premise is that Smith, who was initially an agent of the machines in the first film, has become a renegade program in the latter two, and has begun growing an army of clones that he uses to empower himself within the matrix.  Neo discovers that there is a showdown brewing between he and Smith, and he promises to destroy Smith in exchange for the salvation of Zion.  The machines agree and Neo is off and running.
If this synopsis of the story seems somewhat disjointed, its because the film itself is as well.  The story, though well crafted, is broken up, leaving holes from which obvious questions emerge. The motivations behind the characters actions are seldom explained, leaving the audience feeling abandoned during the viewing of this film.  The characters are shallow, and do not possess the believablity of depth of the earlier films.  Similarly, the look of the film is different, with a greater attention spent on the war itself versus the actions of the characters within the matrix.
All that aside, the film is well assembled from a visual standpoint.  The effects are first rate, as are to be expected in the world of modern films.  Similarly, the soundtrack and the effects are beautifully crafted and completely convincing.  The story itself, though, which makes or breaks any film, is the one big weakness.  It attempts to be profound without ever having its charcters really do anything.
For those who are fans of the Neo/Trinity relationship...be warned, this film will leave you feeling hollow and unfufilled at its conclusion.  Similarly, for those of you out there who have embraced the idea that Neo is ""the One"", be warned, for his character is stripped down and trivialized into an implausible Messiah whose actions and abilities are completely unexplained, as though they are fabricated to bring closure to the film itself.
I do not want to discourage anyone from seeing ""The Matrix: Revolutions"", for it is an action packed, high speed film with enough CG effects to leave your head spinning.  Just understand that the film is not of the caliber of the original Matrix, or even ""The Matrix: Reloaded"".  It is, in this reviewers opinion, a poorly crafted conclusion designed to wrap up the characters a and situations with a bow....instead, it puts many of them in a box (SPOILER AHEAD), for neither the hero, nor the heroine make it to the end of the film.
It is worth the purchase price for the special effects alone, but if you are looking for a continuation of the experience from the original film, you will be disappointed...at least I was.

1893282,3,B00009W2GQ,"The two sequels to THE MATRIX have the same problem.  Sure, they are pretty much equally entertaining, but only the sum of some parts.  The WACHOWSKI's spent too much time in smokey rooms worrying about the phiosophical aspects of their project, and didn't realize the best parts of the original MATRIX were the FX heavy action sequences.  Hey, I'm as critical of plotting and story importance as anyone, but the draw of these B sci-fi flicks is the mayhem.  The battle for ZION is the best thing here, the special effects are simply amazing.  The story is weak.  What actually transpires at the end and why is very up-in-the-air, and seems rather rushed.  Although visually superior to almost anything out there, THE MATRIX series goes out with a dud, fully due to weak story.  Here's MY philosophy; why not make a film with an excellent sci-fi adventure story AND wicked FX?  As with RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS one can be decently satisfied with the one aspect, which is decent enough to like it.",1081641600,,996,4.744186046511628
1893283,1,B00009W2GQ,"And yes, it's every bit as bas as that sounds. The plot holes, the laughably bad dialogue, the cheesiness ingrained in every scene consistently reminded me of both of those films.

Where to begin? First, ""Revolutions"" doesn't even offer one cool action or kung-fu scene. The climatic fight between neo and smith is like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" without the martial arts. Then there's the plot holes, far too many to list, but for example:

1. Why don't the sentinels have guns or weapons of any kind? This is the best the machines could come up with?

2. Why didn't Zion just wait for the sentinels to flood the dock, and then fire the EMP blast? Why did they send all those infantry to die first?

3. Why would machines hold up their end of the agreement made with neo? If all the prisoners are released, how will the machines power their city?

The editing is amazingly bad, but at least this provides the most enjoyable part of the movie, when they're entering the machine city and they insert the cut of trinity warning ""sentinels"" about 10 cuts after they should have (seriously, watch the scene carefully-its hysterical).

Even agent smith, which was the best thing the trilogy had going for it, is awful in ""Revolutions"". In the previous two films  smith had this menacingly cool demeanor and great dialogue, but in ""Revolutions"" he is a cartoon super-villian and gets lines like ""this is my world! mine!""

Other problems: additional worthless side plots involving characters absolutely nobody cares about. A complete lack of challenging metaphysical subject matter or surprises, both present in the first two. And WHY is that scene where jada pinkett smith steers her ship through the mine SO LONG?? WHY!?!??

Seriously, one of the 10 worst movies ever made. And I loved the first two.",1081641600,7,1800,4.818181818181818
1893284,5,B00009W2GQ,"I usually judge a film on the flow of the story, the sum of all of its parts.  There was admittedly, some melodramatic acting in this film.  I don't know if that could be helped due to the scale of the film itself.  Perhaps the actors felt as if they were emoting Shakespeare for that reason.  What I loved about the film was the fact that the heroics of the characters remained consistent.  You knew that Neo was the Chosen One.  And we all know what happens to the savior of any people: they are sacrificed.(...)  I was not at all surprised by the ending.  I was upset by it, but not surprised.  The whole dynamics of the trilogy was about a war between the remnants of mankind and the machines.  There had to be a winner, and there had to be a loser in this war. I was caught off guard by how the war was resolved.  I was satisfied with the writing.  I was satisfied with the special effects.  Most of all, the film had me cheering for the courageous humans who would not give up.  And as for Neo and Trinity: They will live on in my memory as legendary lovers.  Everyone involved in this film should be extremely proud of it.",1081641600,,1129,4.186046511627907
1893285,5,B00009W2GQ,"Once in a generation, there is a movie created by its production crew -- from the director downward -- that is revered so highly that there is an unprecedented focus on style, creativity, detail, tone, direction, cinematography, and cast.  The Matrix Triology surpasses every previous benchmark in movie making history.
Matrix Revolutions begins where Matrix Reloaded ended.  I could not help but think that there are similarities between this movie and our current war against terror.  The movie clearly shows that waiting for an attack by the enemy machines is the wrong approach.  Once the enemy is on your own territory, defense systems may not be able to withstand a persistant and overwhelming attack.  Neo, however, chooses to adopt a more aggressive strategy:  he goes onto enemy territory, the machines, and confronts them.  Perhaps one of the best parts of this movie is that one can analyze and philosophize about what the movie means and how it relates to other things that we are either in other pieces of literature or in the news.  That is why when the production crew said this movie actually does cover every part of life that can conceivable be covered, they probably did not know how right they were.
The movie covers martial arts, fourth-dimensions, the philosophy of allowing machines to develop artificial intelligence, religion, and beautiful renditions of humans enganged in action.  There will probably never be a movie quite like this again.  But I can hope.

1893286,4,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions wraps up the entire series with the same mystique that the original had.  While I think that this movie is nowhere near as good as the original, it does manage to leave us with a well-paced, exciting, and fun end to the trilogy.  While it is true that there were plenty of the uneasy quirks the entire series had us endure (i.e. the spitting blood and martial arts moves that end with the close-up ""bring it on"" hand wave), it remains a great action packed thrill for the senses.
While for some, it isn't the ""All answers revealed"" film it could have been, I liked it because it allowed YOU the viewer to sit back and think it through yourself.  Personally, I don't like too many films that gives you all the answers on a silver platter.  It gives you a reason to watch it more than once.  I get something new out of all three films every time I see them.  But if you ask my opinion, I think that The Source blew up the Smiths.  It used Neo's body to do it once Smith got him.  But again, that's my own opinion.
Don't forget that this is ""JUST A MOVIE."" It is not real and it does not try to give us the meaning of life.  Movies like this should just be enjoyed for what they are: a nice little escape from real life.  Now that its over, it's time to get back to the real world for a while.",1081641600,2,1313,4.113725490196078
1893287,1,B00009W2GQ,"""My cat knows Neo. Do you know?"" ""I, uh, know..."" ""I know you know"" AHHHHHHHHH! The torture of listening to a Matrix stream of thought is like reading a bad copy of Naked Lunch while jamming a fork in your eye. With the hope that Reloaded could possibly carry on what I say is one of the top ten Sci-Fi movies of all time was maybe a false hope, but the highway scene is fantastic, so I would give Reloaded 3 out 5, for mercies sake. But Revolutions gave me the same sensation as being sodomized by a drag queen: you don't know what to expect, but you know it won't be good. From the three million permutations on ""I don't believe in him, but you do, and I believe in you"" to the potentially interesting and exciting Trinity/Oracle-minus-eyes face off that ended in such a, I wouldn't say predictable, because that would be giving it credit, more of a forementioned drag queen feeling. The thought that a suprise may come out of this coma of a movie was too much to hope for. The 40 minute battle between the machines and humans in Zion had great Paris-during-WWI potential, with the out numbered and over gunned humans finally pulling out a victory through sheer force of will, but instead we get two uber-dykes running around with a rocket launcher and some how winning the whole freakin battle for the humans! And the fights seemed to happen just for the sake of meeting some sort of fight quota: each fight seemed to just be spliced together from the superior original and Reloaded and put in a blender with Nobuo Uematsu and cow poo for good measure to come out with the vomit that we see in Revolutions. Possibly one of the most hard core characters in Sci-fi history, Morpheus, is relegated to secondary supporting character status, with, get this, his girlfriend having more lines that he does. The final battle between Neo and Smith, again with high expectations, was just...miserable. A live action Dragonball Z fight would be the best way to describe it: Neo has long bouts of shaking and looking scared as Smith smiles sardonically and evilly. AND THEIR FLYING!! WHAT THE HELL!!! Characters in live action movies do not fly unless they are A) Superman or B) getting blown to bits. The fact that it took Neo 15 freakin minutes to decipher the cryptic innuendo from the suprisingly cool body swapped Smith was just another reason to douse yourself in kerosene and get the whole thing over with. I'm glad that brick dumb Trinity finally gets what she deserves, but the Neo being Jesus thing was a little much for my bland gentile taste. And finally what was the idea behind the humans and machines wanting to live in harmony? I seems that Larry and Andy just got drunk one morning and wrote the piss poor ending to and even piss poorer movie. I highly do not recomend this movie. Eat your dog and sell your children instead, it will be more satisfying.",1081641600,3,2861,4.557281553398059
1893288,2,B00009W2GQ,"Here are all the points that make this movie bad and dissapointing.
  1. We see in the second film Neo stopping the machines with his own hand giving us a clue that something strange is going on to be seen in the third film. But no there is no surprise, no logical explanation as to why the heck Neo is Superman both in the matrix and in the real world. I don't understand why this happened. The validity of the whole movie is ruined by not justifying Neo's extraordinary powers in the real world. The truce with the machines was a logical finalle. But how we reached to the finalle I really don't know.

  2. Trinity really dies in vain and it seems more like black humor to me than a logical flow of the story. (Damn it!!! It's like Lois of Superman being hit by a car and die in the third movie!!! (laughs))
  3. After all the dialogues that the Z brothers wrote in the movies they surelly must have run out of ideas and imagination. And they certainly don't know how to talk to their loved ones at a tragical dying moment! How else can I explain the ludicrous dialogue between Neo and Trin when she dies. Luck of emotion? Creativity? They could steal the lines of a cliche movie and still make their point but they decided to ruin the moment with shallow and ""cold"" lines.
  4. There are more points in the film that are not explained with logic (How the hell did Smith reach to the real world???????????) and if you add them up you are left with the bitter end that you where taken for a full and the marketing guys did their job well, when It should be the Z brothers who should make their job well and pay some respect to their own creation.",1081641600,6,1648,4.23961661341853
1893289,2,B00009W2GQ,"I cannot begin to tell you of my disappointment. This film lacked the substance that the first two had. The dialogue was horrible (bad enough to remind me of Star Wars) and the acting was even worse ... if that's possible. The only positive I found was the special effects, which were again quite incredible. But you cannot make a movie on special effects alone (again see the new Star Wars films) and expect it to be great.

And finally, the ending was a huge disappointment. The first two films left me wanting more, while this one simply made me want it to end.",1081641600,2,564,4.423076923076923
1893290,5,B00009W2GQ,I should be kicking myself for listening to the critics of this film and not seeing it in the theater.  After watching the DVD I was astounded by the action in it.  I love the machinery warfare in the battle of Zion.  You don't need hours of acrobatic CGI stunts to fill the matrix after the first 2 films you get tired with it. I enjoyed seeing mechs blasting robotic sentries.  As for the end of Neo it had to come.  If anyone was following the spiritual philosophies of this series they would understand it's parallel to Christ as in sacrificing himself for the fate of mankind.  It was a known path and Neo knew he would be the balance to the equation.  He was the chosen one.  I thought it was a good plot by the Wachowski brothers.  Sure some people didn't like the ending because they couldn't understand why Neo died or nullified himself.  Others probably caught on to the spiritual philosophy but thought it was a blasphemy.  I for once enjoyed it.  I'm getting the entire Trilogy now.,1081641600,,994,4.430939226519337

The Matrix could've been a Truly Great Series. But, the ending falls flat on it's face. To me, it was very depressing.",1081555200,4,355,4.725806451612903
1893292,4,B00009W2GQ,"And so, ""The Matrix Revolutions"" brings the trilogy to a close (or does it? See the title above).  For those who are passionate about the first movie--and there are many, judging from the reviews posted--""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" managed to align you in one of the following two camps:
1.  You bought into the pop philosophy that is ""The Matrix"", reveled in the ""more questions asked than answered"" mentality of ""Reloaded"", and rejoiced in the religious allegory of ""Revolutions"".
--or--
2.  ""The Matrix"" created this incredible alternative reality but, ""huh?, what happened?"".
Please allow me to set up my camp somewhere in between.
First, I was totally entertained by ""Revolutions"".  Good pacing, incredible action, jaw-dropping CGI effects (although I am feeling ""bullet-timed"" to death lately).  Did it, however, wrap everything up in a nice tidy bundle and explain what the hell actually happened?
Not really ... but I don't think that's a bad thing.
*****SPOILER ALERT (oh hell, you've all seen the movie--why do I bother?)*****
The Wachowskis finished the Matrix trilogy in the same manner they started it, by making us question our perceptions of reality (or, at least, the Matrix reality anyway).  Did Neo die?  Was he working for the machines or against them?  Was the Oracle really his ally?  Did he destroy Agent Smith, or did Smith self-destruct when there was nothing left to assimilate?
The ending to ""Revolutions"" had me scratching my head.  I expected a neat resolution to all the questions posed in ""Reloaded"".  I didn't get it.  But isn't that really what the Wachowskis intended?  The Oracle never gave a straight answer.  We shouldn't expect Larry and Andy to do the same.
The Matrix Trilogy and, especially ""The Matrix Revolutions"", is a high-tech pop-culture shoot-em-up sci-fi action-adventure that makes you think, whether you get it or not.  For even attempting that, the movie deserves high praise.
And, for what it's worth . . . Keanu Reeves is as exciting as toast, Carrie-Anne Moss is my ultimate cyberpunk fantasy girl, Laurence Fishburne needs to do a few tummy crunches, and Hugo Weaving plays too good a villain to ever be killed off.

1893293,5,B00009W2GQ,"Too many people dislike ""The Matrix Revolutions"" for the wrong reasons. They can say that they didn't like the plot or action, but the real reason is that this is a movie that makes you think, and this is not what many people want when they go see a huge-budget action movie. There are very intellectual things in the entire ""Matrix"" series, altough much of it seems to stem from first or second year philosophy courses.
This film is an absolute epic, concluding the series that is not really viewed as an epic in the same way that ""Lord of the Rings"" is, but it should be. A massive world has been created by the Waschowski brothers, one that can be confusing at times, but one that never stops entertaining the viewers. The action here is still second to none, every stunt trying to outdo the last. Of course these stop-motion shots that the directors have invented have become overused and clicheed, but that it because many directors who had no business using this technology were ripping them off left, right and center. The fact is that these guys invented this new style of action, and they are definitely the ones who do it the best. Those who aren't amazed by the action in ""Revolutions"" should give their heads a shake, because they are simply asking too much from a movie.
There are many ways to think about ""The Matrix"", but it is impossible to overlook the religious overtones of the film. Many were dissapointed by the ending of this movie, but look at it like a religion. There are no answers carved into stone, only guidelines and certain things that can only be considered leaps of faith. The same goes for this. Personally I was glad there were a few loose ends, because it lets our imagination play, thinking out how everything else could be resolved.
This brings me back to the first point. If you don't want to use your brain, then do not see this movie, because there is intelligence in it. But this cannot take away from the fact that this is a brilliant action movie, and a series that will be considered an absolute classic in years to come. Think of how these films revolutionized filmmaking over the past five years or so. ""The Matrix"" is important for many reasons, and ""Revolutions"" is an excellent conclusion to the series that managed to amaze people from the start.",1081555200,,2297,4.577669902912621

I had begun to think of the original as a kind of 'Hobbit', and Reloaded and Revolutions were to be 'The Lord of the Rings' one you viewed them together.
But Revolutions takes all the questions that were raised by Reloaded, and even a few that were carried over from the original, and does...nothing with them.  This movie answers none of the questions.  It barely even addresses them, except in a dismissive way early on.  I could have put up with a crappy movie and still walked out satisfied if it had answered these questions in some way, but Revolutions doesn't.
Not only that, but it would be a bad movie even if it wasn't a Matrix sequel. It has no plot. It has almost no kung fu - the single fight sequence in this movie is by far the most forgettable of all three movies. We do get a long battle scene involving characters like the Kid and Zee who we truly don't care about at all, with special effects that are impressive for the first minute, and boring for the next twenty.  The main characters are left on the sidelines, doing nothing.  Even Neo doesn't get any serious screen time until the big finale.
And the finale itself, the big flying battle between Smith and Neo, isn't anywhere near as impressive as the Burly Brawl from Reloaded, or anywhere near as intense as the final Smith-Neo fight from the original.  Neo and Smith fly around, tumble and twist and don't do much real kung fu, and the audience is more engrossed in how cool the rain looks than the actual fight.
And if the hideous, sappy Hollywood ending wasn't bad enough, we don't even get a good Rage Against the Machine song when the credits roll.  I was hoping for 'No Shelter', but what we get instead is a swelling, majestic score that made me want to vomit.
I've watched Reloaded several times now - including three times at the cinema - and the original many more times than that.  I've watched this movie once, on the opening day, and I never intend to see it again.  I only hope that the WB people realise that there's probably a lot of money to be made by admitting that the movie was terrible, and remaking it better a second time.",1081555200,5,2275,4.392857142857143

1893297,1,B00009W2GQ,"Since I view LOTR as a whole movie I might as well review the entire Matrix series as one film.  When I saw the first Matrix, I wasn't too impressed with it.  The SFX were good, the story was interesting but I didn't feel as if it was worth all the hype.  But my friends who loved it convinced me to give it another chance and I did and I admit I enjoyed it a lot more.  But mostly from a action film POV and not because of the philosphy (which has already been done to death, IMO).  When I heard of Reloaded I couldn't wait, and during this time Matrix effects were popping up everywhere and I had to suffer my friends telling me how Matrix is going to be the next best film triolgy vs LOTR (For some reason they were in competition)  But face it as much as I enjoyed Matrix, LOTR was better.  Well, Reloaded hit the screen and I couldn't believe what I was seeing, the effects looked like video game cut scenes, the fight scenes were dull, whatever happened to the gritty feel of the first film?  And it seemed around this time the W. bros were actually believing in their own philosophical hype to the point where it was just plain tedious.  So when Revolutions came out I didn't want to waste time or money seeing it, but everyone was telling me how I should view it as one full film and revolutions is where it gets good again.  (Of course after they saw it they couldn't say much of anything about Matrix being a great triolgy.) and I was even told not to watch it.
Well recently I decided to just see the last installment and just be done with it.  So I rented it for movie night.  The results? We paid attention for five mins then we started talking about anything other than what was happening in the film and when we did try to pay attention it was endless ""Do you know?""  ""I know, but do you know I know?""  ""Yes, I know you know.""  ""What about her does she know?""  ""No, I don't know"" It's obvious that these guys ran out of pretentious things to say so decided to be pretentious for pretentious sake.  We tried hard to understand what the heck was even happening in this train wreck of a film but to no avail.  Soon we decided that this movie sucks and was no longer interested in watching, so we chapter skipped until we found at least something to hold our attention, which ended up being the Neo vs Smith fight which was quite good until it became over done.  Then we find out that the humans and Machines, after everything, decide to just simply live in peace?  Is this a joke from the filmmakers?  Like saying Reloaded and Revolutions were a waste of time and money, just like the wasted time of the characters in this movie?  There should have only been one film and one film only, plain and simple.

1893299,4,B00009W2GQ,"'Revolutions' Was Highly Understated Compared To The Other 'Matrix' Movies. But This Film Exceeded Where 'Reloaded' Failed In My Opinion: More Action, Less Tedious Dialogue Sessions.
In 'Reloaded' We Were Treated To Mind Numbing Dialogue, And Some Very Shallow Characters. 'Revolutions' Has Some Of The Same Characters, But They Do Not Appear As Much (Most Noticeably The Merovingian). Some Also Do Not Appear At All.
I Enjoyed 'Revolutions' Very Much. Once Again, It Is Still Not As Groundbreaking As The Original Flick, But It Is Still Decent. Any One Who Enjoyed The First Two Films Will Most Likely Also Enjoy This.
In My View I Enjoyed The Films From ""The Matrix"", To ""The Matrix Revolutions"", And Lastly To ""The Matrix Reloaded"". The Original, I Suppose, Is Always Better Than The Sequels.
The Saga Goes As This: Birth (""The Matrix""), Life (""The Matrix Reloaded""), and Death (""The Matrix Revolutions""). I Also Realized The First One Has Time Partly In The Matrix, And Partly In the Real World, The Second Movie Spends Most Of The Time In The Matrix, And The Third Movie Spends Most Of The Time In The Real World.
I Enjoyed The Action Sequences, Most Of All The End Scene With The Neo/Smith Showdown, Which Is Pretty Unpredictable In My View (The Music In That Scene Has A Nice Touch To It, With Choruses Singing Upanisands Transcripts). The Zion Fight With The Machines Is Intense, And Has Very Superb Special Effects (Better Compared To 'Reloaded' Effects).
So If You Want More Groundbreaking And New Stuff, Do Not Expect Anything Here. But Like I Said In My 'Reloaded' Review, If You Are A Hardcore Matrix Fan Like Me, You Would Most Definitely Enjoy This.",1081468800,2,1664,4.862676056338028
1893300,3,B00009W2GQ,"MOTS from the invisible Wachowski brothers.  'Matrix Revolutions' is really two movies: 1) The boring, gibberish-laden love, philosophy, and technospeak sequences, and 2) the exciting, spectacular effects action portions, mostly contained in the last hour of the film.
The plot is pretty much the same muddled gunk that we saw in the first two films, rife with long treatises that really don't seem to mean much of anything. A notable example is the meandering speech by the Frenchman (aka 'The Merovingian') in the dance club - what the heck was that?  I dare say that the writing quality diminished with each sequel...
Thankfully, there is notably less grandiose posturing by the Morpheus character in this 3rd episode (Laurence Fishburne); he actually seems to have an inferiority complex sitting next to Jada Pinkett's ship pilot.  Neo (Keanu Reeves) seems less confident in his 'The One' capabilities.  Of course, he summons up the strength he needs by the big finale.
The action sequences were simply spectacular.  When the giant boring machines pierce Zion's walls, hordes of Sentinels pour in, to be met by a hail of fire from the phalanx of APUs awaiting below (the Sentinel 'clouds' appear to be based on massive schools of fish, flowing in unison).  It is truly a huge battle, taking up nearly 20 minutes of screen time.  When Neo meets Smith for the final battle, it is truly cataclysmic, with explosions of water, rock, and buildings that approach nuclear in scale.
Overall, this film deserves to be rated right in the middle: 2 1/2 stars.  The shallowness of the characters, babbling dialogue, and stereotypical love story are balanced by awesome effects work.  What is lacking here is a great story to work with.  In my mind, this trilogy is a long way from what is now the consensus definitive example of the genre: Lord of the Rings.  The Matrix series seemed to get worse with each episode from a plot standpoint, while 'LOTR' built up to a crescendo with 'Return of the King'.  The Matrix filmakers did not have the luxury (or difficulty) of having a true classic piece of literature to base their work on.  Because of this, 'Matrix Revolutions' is pretty easy to forget after watching.",1081468800,,2205,4.895161290322581

Actually counting down the months until they were out. And boy was I disappointed. Reloaded was passable but Revolutions totally sucked. One of the worst movies I ever saw in my life. I went into this expecting one of the greatest conclusions ever and a great movie also. Both were horrible. The story in the first Matrix was awesome. Well written and did not need the crutch of special effects to carry it. Although the effects were great. Revolutions was a snore fest from the first scene. Way too long fight scenes did not help. You can only get hit so many times with no reaction. I could not wait for them to end. Plus the killed off Trinity. So you know some how this movie was doomed. And yes it was. What do you call that ending. The machines just stop fighting, continue to exist and rely on humans to exist. I thought the idea of the humans rebellion from Zion is to free the people. But apparently the Wachowski saw how many suckers there are and might try to do a 4th movie when the people actually are freed. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. GO rent it.

Neo is not even around for most of the movie, then he gets his eyes fried, but of course he can still see.  The battle for Zion is cool, it is what makes the movie worth watching.  But as for story development, it sucks.  I thought they would explain more of how Neo got his powers, I mean they basicaly make him a God.  I guess I expected much more from a franchise boasting as much as the Matrix trilogy has.  It seems as if nothing from the second movie even made it to the third.

First off, Revolutions is much better and more satisfying than Matrix Reloaded, and the CGI effects are better as well.  Picking up right where Reloaded left off, Neo (Keanu Reeves) finds himself trapped between the real world and the artificial world of the Matrix while the war between man and machine rages on both fronts as the people of Zion defend the city against the endless swarms of sentinels and the multiplying Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) grows more powerful in the world of the Matrix.  There aren't as many jaw dropping action scenes (until the film's climax) that populated the previous two films, but the battle for Zion and the ultra epic Super Burly Brawl in which Neo and Smith fight for the final time are marvels of modern movie magic.  As a whole however, just like Reloaded, Revolutions just can't live up to the awe of the original film.  And as much as I like the two later entries of the series, I can't help but think that there never should have been a Matrix trilogy.  When we saw Neo fly towards the sky at the end of the first film, that should have been it, but naturally Warner Bros. knows how to milk a good thing dry.  The DVD itself is much better on features than the disappointing Reloaded two disc set; with featurettes that are actually worth watching.  However, there is yet again no commentary at all.

The armies of Zion are running otu of time before the final war for humanity starts but it's ultimately Neo who will determine the fate of humanity.
 This is a really fun and adrenaline-rushing action flick but the storyline is very hard to follow. I also didn't like some of the acting by some of the crew and like a previous reviewer said, Persephone and Merovingian were absolutely pathetic and could easily have been left out altogether.
 Other than that, thsi is a satisfying conclusion to the Matrix trilogy. It's just that it could've been done better. That's all. Otherwise, just go and get this DVD and have a good time!!",1081382400,,1045,4.699453551912568

The gatekeeper or keymaster or master programmer or whoever the hell he is still wants a war and is still alive at the end.

It would be very interesting to see the latter two films in the same form in which they were shot, which is to say, together.  For a brief rundown, the effects and action sequences were spectacular, the acting was actually not awful and the the death of one major character actually elicited surprise from me.  (SPOILER WARNING!):  Neo's demise, however, did not, and that is my primary problem with the film.  Just rename Neo Jesus and get it over with.  I could see it coming a mile away and, while it's not a bad way to go in a narrative sense, I felt let down by the lack of suspense.

  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Harold Perrineau, Hugo Weaving, Collin Chou, Clayton Watson, Anthony Wong, Anthony Zerbe and 19 other cast members return from the second film, THE MATRIX RELOADED (2003).
  Gloria Foster (""The Oracle"") passed away from diabetes on September 29, 2001.  Alice Brady, whom she had worked on Broadway with for 2 years in ""Having No Say"", stepped in to play the Oracle.

  Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Bane (Ian Bliss) are in a coma, but in the Matrix. Seraph (Collin Chou) calls that Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) must see The Oracle (Alice Brady) at once!  Neo is lost in the Matrix. Actually he is at the subway station at Mobil Avenue that leads into the Matrix.  The Trainman (Bruce Spence) works for Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and he is going to make it very difficult for our team.  At the station, Neo meets a friendly family that is a program, Rama Kandra (Bernard White), Kamala (Tharini Mudaliar) and Sati (Tanveer K. Atwal).  When Neo finds his way, he must speak to Oracle.

It had the same style of actions sequences, it had the same bad ass villian in Agent Smith, Neo still did the insane kick ass stuff he always did, so where was the problem?
The story here is that Zion is about to be destroyed by the machine Army.  It is up to NEo to go in and take stop them, however when Agent Smith becomes so powerful the both Man and Machine are in danger it is up to NEo to stop him in the ever classic battle of Good vs Evil.
I guess people had problems with these movies because in many ways they had to high of expectations.  The case here is much like the case with the new Star Wars Trilogy, it is the same style of film making with a number of characters we are familiar with, but people got their hopes and expectations to high and in the end it came crashing down into oblivion for them.  That curse hit MAtrix by psycho obssessive fans and the same I fear will happen to the follow ups to both Spiderman, X-Men, and and other follow ups to incredible smashs (I am talking to you The Hobbit).

1893313,1,B00009W2GQ,"Not since Deep Blue Sea have I cared so little about the protagonists of a movie and never have I felt the urge to drink heavily more genuinely than during this movie. I had been hoping for the best after a film (Reloaded) that disappointed me in more ways than I could count.
Oh dear.
After 50 minutes I stopped watching the clock and reached for the fast forward button. You could cut an hour and a half out of this film and it still wouldn't actually resolve anything but it would at least be watchable.
The main protagonists have much less screen time than previously leaving us struggling to identify a sequence of grungy extras. Perhaps people who had watch Reloaded more recently before seeing this would know who they were, to me they added nothing but confusion.
The action sequences while chock-full of cgi bored me rigid. We watched the same thing again and again. It's not impressive when it's like that, it's just dull and why, oh why didn't those stupid humans just set up a sequence of EMP devices outside Zion and shield / turn off the electronics inside? Did they want to die? Why would the machines honour an agreement with a species they'd been using and exterminating?
Most of all, what was the point?
The Matrix leaves the audience with a good romp and the best of endings for this type of story, one open to possibilities. Of all the possibilities out there, what prompted them to choose this one? Ultimately the premise of the matrix is full of holes and requires heavy suspension of disbelief. This works for one film. When you then rely on that weak premise, indeed expand upon it, all you do is draw attention to the holes.

1893314,3,B00009W2GQ,"Well, the special effects and other features are brilliant and groundbreaking, but this movie lacks the clear focus of the first and the inventive adventure of the second. Since now virtually anything imaginable can be done flawlessly with CGI the effects almost become unimportant. What matters most is story-structure and character, and the Wachowski's laid an egg here.
It's basically the last part of a soap opera that could have been deep and meaningful but is instead a kind of active comic-book storyboard sequence. This movie would never stand by itself - there just wasn't a lot of life in these people.
My largest quibble is..how does Neo start 'blowing up' things in the real world?  The only explanation is ... that there's another layer of abstraction, underneath both men and machines, and Neo is God in that one also??  It's a purposely un-answered question that effectively turns the story from being a wonderful platform for all sorts of philosophy, into a big pot of BS mumbo-jumbo.  I couldn't digest this mess - so I didn't really care after a while.
Other minor quibbles..
1) Neo and Agent Smith had lots of punch-fests in #1 & #2. The conclusion, with Neo 'melting' into Smith and blowing him up, was the same end as #1.  I suppose he was supposed to 'transcend the fight' again, like Buddha fighting Satan, approaching Nirvana.. Gimme a break - it's been done already.
2) Neo goes blind.. This seemed like a contrived plot-device.  Ooh he can see without his eyes - what a spiritualist!
3) The starting point with the Merovingian was pure comic-book pulp - it added nothing and was a waste of time.
4) I know from experience that people fighting giant mechanical squids usually wear body-armor. leaving them exposed like that was ridiculous.  Or one could say the whole battle was corny, because it would have been easier for the Machines to just Nuke Zion.  There are a lot of similar plot holes, I'm starting to ramble.
5) Lastly, the end of he story is not fulfilling - the Matrix continues, so really this is a push-off between opposing forces.  We all wanted the defeat or death of the Architect.  He was the enemy of humanity.  Saving Zion was important, but it was a distraction - I'm amazed that the Wachowski's didn't recognize this.  They had to kill that pompous old dude! Why did they hold back??
So now we're set up for sequels forever in a franchise.  Somehow I'm not really forward to them any more.  Too bad.",1081296000,7,2447,4.702576112412178

All three main characters - Neo, Trinity and Morpheus - in Reloaded and Revolutions, are just too lifeless, aside from the obvious, that there is a departure from the story for the sake of big budget effects (Hey, I love well-made fx, don't get me wrong!)  Or is it just bad acting?  (I know, I know. They were supposed to be computerized.)  I'll tell you what I think is the culprit - those darn sunglasses.  Acting is in the eyes, and if you can't see the eyes, out goes the expression.  Why do they have to wear the sunglasses underground, also?  Fashion?  Who cares about looking cool when the whole world is coming to an end!  For argument sake, look back at the original Matrix.  Neo and Trinity were newbies and fresh, trying to solve the puzzle - how to save humanity.  There was more self-discovery in the ""real"" world, on board the Neberknezzer (mispelled, huh).  Neo, Trinity and Morpheus were not so busy trying to look cool as in the sequels.  Believe or not, my favorite character is the Oracle.  Even though she has a small part, she is the only one I care about the most.  She possesses a lot of spunk for a matrix concontion.  Too bad, the original actress, is not in Revolutions, because of her unfortunate, untimely death in real life.  (Did you catch the irony of what she eats in Reloaded?)  Revolutions take place 100% underground or in a very cloudy world, so you vampires will feel at home.  The Sentinals vs. the human machines is worth a look-see, but the Super Burly Brawl is not as fun to watch as before because the bad weather makes it hard to see.  I just wish Mr. Smith and Neo had chosen to slap-each-other-silly on a day that wasn't raining.  As a grand finale, the ending is convoluted, leaving more questions than answers.  It leaves an unsatisfactory feeling in my stomach, kind of like amusement park food.  As tragic as the story is going, The Wachowski Brothers sell out by slapping on a hollywood-like ending.  Sunny skies and all.
If you don't care about the story that much, but want amazing visuals, I would recommend Reloaded over Revolutions.  The martial arts choreography, with weapons, this time, is amazing.  And the highway scene is unsurpassable.  However, if you can only afford one DVD in this series, and you want the best, get the first Matrix.  (Now, I have to figure out why George Lucas messed up the prequels.  Jar Jar... Lucas trying to please his kids...)",1081296000,,2712,4.554865424430642
1893319,5,B00009W2GQ,"O.K. I am willing to ceed the fact that this movie is flawed, but it is also one of the most complex and thought provoking films I have ever seen.  Yes the acting and the pacing could have been a lot better.  Yes the Brothers have a nack for writing some very cheesey lines, but to dismiss the philosophic underpinings of this film as mindless hokum (as some reviewers have done) would be to deny these series of films their greatess strength.  Science Fiction, more than any other genre, has the ability to raise complex questions about the nature of the human experience.  If you pay close attention several themes dealing with issues of control, power, fate, faith, hope and most importantly to mind CHOICE come up again and again.  I have my own theories about what these films might be trying to say, and a lot of that goes against what other viewers have thought these movies were about, and I'm not going to waste your time explaining my theory (the open ended conclusion of the story suggests that the brothers wanted people to find their own meaning in these films).  Now maybe you don't like philosophy and such and just want to see cool Kung Fu (then watch the first film), but if you want to go deeper watch these films again and again and think about what kind of views each of these characters represent.  I think the reason these films were greeted with such hostility is that they actually challanged viewers to think about what was going on (instead of showing you exactly what they were trying to get at).  Most modern entertainment gives us all the answers, these films ask you to try and come up with some on your own.  Try it, because making up your own mind is far more rewarding than being told what to think.",1081296000,8,1732,4.490445859872612

1893322,3,B00009W2GQ,"The first Matrix film was an incredible phenomenon, and became an instant classic with it's intricate premise, colorful characters, mind-blowing martial-arts action and never-before-seen special effects which have become the mother of all imitation.
The follow-up, The Matrix: Reloaded, was released 4 years after the original film. By this point, the movie had been re-hashed, imitated, and joked about. Bullet time, which was introduced in the original film, was ripped off by other films, to where when this sequel lept off the screen, it almost seemed as it was imitating it's own self. Reloaded also spent it's running time almost completely mired in its own confusion. I felt this overwhelming need by the Wachowski brothers to try to explain their marvelous creation to the waiting public. The freeway scene was the pinnicle of the movie, but the ending was a train wreck. Call me stupid, but to me, it's no fun to be confused. I disliked walking out of the theater feeling like I was involuntarily subjected to a 10 minute crash course in the laws of physics.
Now that our brains hurt from the second film, now we can relax and enjoy the spectacle of The Matrix: Revolutions, knowing that all the information we could ever want again in our lives just took place in the second film. Revolutions kicked up the action a few notches, and left our brains alone for the most part.
The Matrix movies had the capability to become one of the greatest trilogies of all time, next to the original Star Wars trilogy and The Lord Of The Rings series.
At the end of Return of the Jedi in the Star Wars trilogy, good conquered evil, and the hero saved the day.
At the end of The Return Of The King in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, we are given the most definitive finale in cinema history.
In the Matrix: Revolutions, that little window of opportunity to make more cash down the road for the series was propped open. As was proven by the final dollar take at the gate for both Reloaded and Revolutions, it would have been better to nail the window shut, never to be opened again.",1081209600,,2074,4.653950953678474
1893323,4,B00009W2GQ,"With the first Matrix (meaning the actual film, not the perfect world :) ), I loved it immediately. It was, and still is IMHO, a perfect sci-fi film. It's one of the greatest ever.
With Reloaded, it took time for it to grow on me. I liked it, but didn't love it like the first one. The burly brawl, the highway chase scene, and overall story was cool, but there were just some things about it that weren't necessary.
With Revolutions, I liked it right away. Maybe it was because of all the cool war scenes and seeing the machine city. Maybe it was Deus Ex Machina. Maybe it was the super burly brawl between Smith and Neo. Maybe it was the fact that there wasn't a pointless and overly long sex/party scene in Zion this time. Or maybe it was all those reasons, but the point is that I liked this one right way, and better than Reloaded.
Revolutions does have its flaws. Everyone went in expected all of their questions to be answered, and what they got was ""Hey, watch the Animatrix, play ""Enter the Matrix"" on your XBox or PS2, and browse the internet to find all the answers"" instead. This movie hardly offered any explanations. Some were there, but they were very, very vague and easily overlooked. With any other questions, you have to do some research outside of watching the film. Most people don't want to do that. We don't want it all spelled out for us, but we want to be able to watch a film and understand what's going just by doing that. Anything like the Animatrix anime DVD or the Enter the Matrix video game should just be extra goodies, not required material.
But, the movie does make sense after doing some research on the net. I'm not going to go into why it does, but it pretty much works IMHO. (...)Check out this link to read something I read that helped out a lot: [...]
(...)The story is quite unique and interesting. It's action-packed. The war in Zion has just about all I wanted to see. The only thing that would've made it better would be if Neo and Trinity were fighting at Zion as well. We don't see them for about a half hour of the film, because they're off going to the machine city. It was cool and all, but I think they could've found a way to do both.
And what's wrong with the sunrise scene? It seems like a lot of people are complaining about that, but I really don't have a problem with the ending at all.
Anyway, good movie, good DVD.",1081209600,,2373,4.322869955156951
1893324,4,B00009W2GQ,"The third instalment of the Wachowski brothers' cyberpunk trilogy pretty much delivers as much as fans of the series could expect from a final chapter. Picking up directly from the end of Matrix Reloaded, Revolutions wastes no time drawing you compellingly back into the dystopic netherworld of Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the omnescient Agent Smith. Fans of the original who were turned off by the 2nd instalment may definitely find more to savor here - Revolutions shamelessly rips off enough popular sequences from the original Matrix to recover some ground amongst the action set left cold by the deliberate pacing and mythologising of pt 2. And - although the Wachowskis deserved greater recognition of their distinctly un-Hollywood attempt to do something different with their 2nd instalment - it has to be said the return to familiar action conventions is rather  more satisfying. There's still enough mock-philosophical mumbo jumbo to keep the anorak set engaged  - but Matrix Revolutions is more sure-footed than its immediate predecessor about what it fundamentally best is - a crowd-pleasing bubblegum action blockbuster. So put your brain on hold; suspend your disbelief and throw away any expectation of a logical conclusion. That done, strap yourself in and get ready for one hell of a ride!",1081209600,2,1304,5.23444976076555
1893325,4,B00009W2GQ,"This is a great movie. But, nevertheless compared to Reloaded, this movie is a little tame when it comes to the action sequences. But, then again, it's the continuing storyline that we're insterested in here. The Wachowski Brothers has done it again with their groundbreaking effect. And this time, they've up the ante with the Super Burly Brawl sequence, very impressive. Although the storyline is there, it wasn't arranged in order. In fact, it was thrown all over the movie in bits and pieces, left there for the poor audience to wreck his/her brains out. So is the plot. By all means, this movie is great when partnered and watched with the first two Matrix movies, but when taken apart, this movie doesn't look great as a standalone sci-fi action movie. That's where it falls short. Another part is when Neo decided, at the last minute, to sacrifice his life to Smith, for the sake of Zion, the grand finale seems to lack the ""boom"" effect. If you're a true Matrix fan, like me, you should put the flaws aside and you'll enjoy the ride. Also, on a lighter note, the two latter movies should've done better without the so-called ""bedroom scenes"" or the sexuality parts, which was really unnecessary. We know, Neo and Trinity are meant to be together, but they don't have to put it so ""elaborately"". There's where the movie becomes ""diluted"" to a certain point. If you ask me, I'd say that I still love the first movie, The Matrix, a no-nonsense sci-fi action movie and in my humble opinion, the first is always the best no matter which way you watch it. That's why I only gave 4 stars. But, on a whole, The Matrix Revolutions is somewhat a great movie. Just my two cents worth!",1081123200,,1681,4.588039867109635
1893326,5,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions, much like The Matrix Reloaded, is a victim of the hype machine that powered it.  These sequels were built up until, coupled with the legacy of the original, there was no way these movies could meet everyone's expectations.
Despite what the naysayers will tell you, The Matrix Revolutions is an excellent movie; lightyears beyond most other films in its genre.
The plot is much more intelligent and interesting than your standard sci-fi / action flick.  There are several layers to the conflict that the predecessors of this movie have built up.  The action is first-rate; whether it is a gun-fight on a ceiling, a massive assault on an underground city, or the climactic battle between Smith and Neo in the rain, Revolutions attempts to one-up its sequels in any way possible.
Many complain that not enough was wrapped up or that not enough questions were answered.  To quote the original Matrix, the answers are there, but the movie can only show you the door - you're the one that has to walk through it.  The Matrix trilogy has never been about giving answers - it is about posing questions and making you answer them for yourself.  You know, actually THINKING a little - a quality that is most unlike the vast majority of action movies.  Obviously, not everyone will like this - some people want to sit back and zone out when watching a movie.
The Matrix movies have received far more flak than they deserve; ripping on the sequels has become, for many, a 'cool' thing to do.  I would contend that, when given a chance with an open mind, these movies stand as one of the best trilogies of all time along with Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.",1081123200,,1669,4.633898305084746
1893327,5,B00009W2GQ,"The story of the Matrix trilogy is a wondrous one; in fact the most wondrous of all stories as it is the story of human enlightenment. It is the mythic story of the traditions - east and west. It's a map of a territory, the ultimate territory, the territory of Self. The Matrix trilogy, like all myths, is a story that carries its message wrapped in a metaphor. And like all mythic metaphors, the Matrix trilogy can be unpackaged at many levels, with the deeper levels re-presenting the same message with progressive sophistication and meaning. As with all art, that sophistication and meaning can only be appreciated and interpreted in the light of the context (cognitive, emotional, and spiritual) that the viewer brings to the viewing. One aspect of all great mythic traditions is that while the story remains a constant, the context of the one who hears the story is always growing, and consequently the meaning of the message expands with each telling of the tale. One definitely needs to see the Matrix movies many times to truly tune into what is being communicated. In any event, it seems clear that just about everybody brought sufficient contextual awareness to their viewing of the first Matrix to appreciate the story at multiple levels. Beyond the intensity of the sci-fi surface story, everybody, looking from the perspective of virtually any of the spiritual or philosophical traditions, resonated with the story line ideas suggesting that the world as we commonly perceive it, is - in certain important ways - an illusion; therefore - wake up!
Unfortunately, Reloaded and Revolutions have not (thus far) faired as well; but this is only because much of the general public (and almost all of the professional reviewers) didn't look deep enough into the rabbit hole. The fact that the surface sci-fi story in Reloaded/Revolutions seems burdened for some viewers must be considered a failing of sorts for these movies because the very best mythic stories work for everyone, at least on the surface, even on the first pass. Clearly, Reloaded / Revolutions has not worked for everyone, at least not on the surface, and not on the first pass. But these movies do work, and work marvelously if we make the effort and take the time to look below the surface, and keep looking until we see some reflection of what it is that the Wachowski brothers are intending to convey. But they won't tell us - not outright, and for a very good reason. To truly get the Matrix message, you have to see it for yourself. Remember, the Brothers made Bound to prove they could make a movie, and then made the Matrix to gain the leverage to tell the rest of their tale in Reloaded / Revolutions. Does anyone really think that the minds that produced the Matrix could scheme and create for three years and come up with a meaningless message in their sequel? To find the treasure buried in these movies, we need to keep looking. But I have come to the conclusion that the secret of the treasure is hidden in plain view. For those who bring a sufficiently rich awareness of one or more of the religious or philosophical traditions to their viewing, or for those who are willing to just think very deeply about the metaphor as it is presented, Reloaded/ Revolutions will, I can assure you, reveal itself as a satisfying and enlightening conclusion to the spiritual adventure that captured our imagination in the original Matrix.",1081123200,,3413,4.796264855687606
1893328,3,B00009W2GQ,"There are absolutely awesome scenes in Revolutions, and I caught myself with my mouth wide open at the scope of some of the battles.  The problem is that I felt both during and after than there should be so much more.  Here we are in the final and the characters that we have become familiar with (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus) are giving secondary roles.  Morpheus for his part plays little more than Chewbacca to Jada Smith's Han Solo.  Neo is gone for a large section of the movie and Trinity as a character hasn't developed in the past two movies.
In the beginning of the movie, when things should become clearer, the movie introduces new concepts (the Train station scene) and when we meet the Frenchman again (after a long, and rather pointless battle), his character feels as if it has little purpose in this movie except to pout.
Its unfortunate that the people who will get the most from this movie are the same people who also saw the Animatrix (where the Matrix mythology is better explained).  Basically, if you rely on the movies alone, Revolutions is shallow.  It only makes sense in my opinion if you see Animatrix first.
The main problem I have is that Reloaded and Revolutions seem like a step back from the concepts of the first Matrix.  In the Matrix, the battle scenes were spectacular but they had a purpose: they explained how Neo was gaining in power.  In Reloaded and especially in Revolutions, I got the sense that the Brothers added action for the sake of pace.  Some of the battles could have been substantially cut down or removed entirely, leaving more to elaborate on issues.
I enjoy watching movies that challenge me.  On the other hand, Reloaded and Revolutions became purposely and sloppily obtuse movies.  Judged on their own merits, the Matrix sequels fail.  They are shallow in places when there should be more exposition (i.e. the vampires in Reloaded, Agent Smith and his increase in power) and overkill when less would be so much more (the nightclub scene in Revolutions, the rave in Reloaded, and sentinal battle).",1081123200,,2048,4.738028169014084
1893329,2,B00009W2GQ,"I said it with ReLoaded, and I stand by my statement...the Matrix should have been one movie and that is it. This movie is an improvement over ReLoaded, but still does not compare at all to the first one.
One of the problems with ReLoaded was that there were too many new characters.  The problem remains, as none of the new characters have any feeling to them.  You care about Neo, & Smith pretty much.  Even Morpheus, and Trinity to an extent, seem irrelevant in this chapter.  Everyone else...meaningless.  It is just one big faceless war.
The war for Zion is the only thing that saves this movie.  It is done rather well, and I give them credit for it.  But, without giving anything away, the way in which the war concludes is just a MAJOR letdown after all the buildup.  It basically makes anything the film did right seem pointless, and will simply anger you.
This is not a movie to see more than once.  Curiosity to see how it concludes if you have seen ReLoaded is the ONLY reason to watch this movie.  If you have only seen the first one, avoid the sequals at all cost.",1081123200,,1078,4.371859296482412

I had hours of debates after this one, just like the first.  A lot of the things that people are saying were pointless distractions were put in the movie to explain what Neo is.  The indian family, for example, were there to show you that programs can in fact feel love.  Smith possessed Bane to show that a program can live inside a humans body.  Neo was a program that loved.  As the Architech explained, Neo has been there before.  This war has been going on for who knows how long.  How could it not end in a treaty of some sort.  If the humans won, they would have to live in the stone ages.  If they lost, how would the machines live without humans as a powersource?  Neo exsisted to prove that humans and machines could live in peace.  If he and Trinity can love one another, why can't there be peace.  Is this movie as good as the first, no.  It is an expansion of the premise.  Hopefully anymore will come in the form of anime, games, and books.  The first movie took the religion angle, while the last 2 took more of a mythology path.

The fights were unfulfilling, the usually great supporting characters are pathetic, and the graphics brought nothing new to the discussion. No wonder the Academy totally ignored every aspect of this movie, as it was unworty of any such consideration.

  The war between man and machine takes ahead as the machines reach the human underground base. Meanwhile, Neo is stuck between the real world and the Matrix itself, while Agent Smith walks through the Matrix taking over everything in his path and cloning it in his image (even the Oracle can't stop him). Its up to the human resistance and Neo to stop the machines and Agent Smith from destroying both worlds.

There's very little explanation for certain things that happen. I understand everything not making sense in the 2nd movie, because it has the third to explan all that. This movie hardly does any explaning, and one is forced to resort to the internet to find the explanations.
The other thing that I thought wasn't that great was the fact that Neo and Trinity disappear for a half hour while we're watching the war in Zion. It would've been nice to cut back and forth a couple times to just remind us of what Trinity and Neo are up to. And Morpheus didn't get enough screen time.

1893342,5,B00009W2GQ,"A few minutes after the movie had ended and as the credits were rolling on the screen, it became apparent to me that this would be one of the most misunderstood and less satisfying movie story endings of all time. Yes, the fight scenes between Smith and Neo are worthy of Dragonball. Yes, the inevitable Bumbling Boy Saves World cliche had to be revisited. And yes, I am sure many other formulaic choices were made.
It does not really matter/
In my view, every event that happens in the movie is justified by the fact that its objective is not that of presenting a staisfying conclusion to the story, but of making this story reach a higher level of importance. Of making it into a myth rather than just another action-adventure piece of entertainment. It seems sad to me that making people happy be SO easy for any filmmaker. If they just saturate the movie with visual effects, deliver a ton of fight sequences from interesting angles and provide a sex xcene or two, most moviegoers are delighted. It would have been SO simple to do that for this film. Instead, the writer-directors did not compromise their vision and ended the story in an elegant fashion, with a complex message reminiscent of the best aspects of Arthurian Mythos (The barge in which Neo is carried off, maybe dead, maybe sleeping, to a realm of twilight, neither physical nor virtual, presumably both, to be available as the Oracle says, when he is needed again) the Norse sagas (Neo loses BOTH eyes, going one better over Wotan-Odin in order to see into the realm of the invisible and acquire the wisdom that only comes from coexisting in both worlds) and Buddhist philosophy, as he proves that there are no pairs of opposites and that divisions reside only in the mind of those beings who place self over all. THat is the meaning behind his resolution of the Smith dilemma, the way Smith is drawn into him so that a new synthesis, resulting of the union of both opposed proposals can be managed. The Machines are compelled into accepting a new order  by his actions, one that is neither of dominance nor of servitude. A new Matrix is restarted in which the Choice that every being in it must face is made clearer and in which cooperating with the machines is more voluntary. THat is the reason behind the dawn of course. The Matrix is a false world and everything is possible in it if one chooses to order that something becomes so. Neo is the Chosen One because he BELIEVES he is the chosen one. He has faith in it. And just like the first  movie is determined by that word, belief, and the second by choice, this third one is determined by the word hope: To trust in something that lies beyond the ken of senses, and act in confident security of its being favourable. This goes hand to hand with faith. THe ultimate human strength and most sublime of weaknesses, just as the Architect points out. All programs, being desirous of getting to be more and more human-like, seek only the basest of human emotions to be their guides. Ambition is seen as the end-all motive of their existence. But in order to defeat them, they must be shown an alternate truth that Neo must learn as the story progresses: THat living or dying is meaningless if it is not done for others instead of for one's self. And it is to me apparent that humans in the movies are shown to learn this at some point or another, making Neo a Chosen One only insofar as he is the one delivering the message that has been learned by these survivours through hardship and death. This makes the story of the Bumbling Boy Hero relevant and meaningful. This tints the scenes of battle at the Docks with a light of importance beyond that of hardware and flesh colliding in terrible conflict (And no one can fault these sequences from any viewpoint, I believe. The mechanisms, systems, combat tactics, etc. employed, make perfect sense. The ONE concession to movie goers is that of the terminal operator who is looking at the machines repairing their giant drill asking  what they are doing. Anyone in his position would know, being as he is accustomed to fighting this enemy. He merely asks it so that audiences can center their attention in that fact. Unrealistic, but... Helpful to some, I suppose).
The Matrix is made into a cycle in this movie. A cycle that begins, suffers revolutions that involve pain and sacrifice, but eventually ends, giving birht to a new dawning world that will continue the journey, having advanced at least one more step in the direction of unity. One can only hope our world were thus ensured of improvement after every mishap.
THis is not a movie that makes sense by itself. It is part of a story and must be seen as such. It is not meant to be liked, it is meant to give a message. It is a honest attempt at communicating ideas that the writer-directors have, which are a compillation of others, none new. It is an effort very similar to that of George Lucas with his Star Wars saga, and of course to that of Tolkien in LOTR. And to that of any author who intends to link the audience with the symbols and ideas that make up our collective unconscious. Nothing more formulaic OR relevant than to accomplish that.

Reloaded:
Couldn't live up to the original but has its moments.
Revolutions:
Everthing about this movie is wrong
a)At the begining the movie, we are shown that machines are also capable of having feelings and are able to love. (This totally goes against the idea of the first movie where we are shown that machines are cold ,calculative and are incapable of mercy. James Cameron painted a better picture of what machines would be like in his Terminator movies)
b)The Zion action scenes were to long and repetitive. The club lobby fight scene was good but it was too short.
c)The Super Burly Brawl was like watching an episode of Dragonball Z. (I know that the Matrix has influences of anime but c'mon!?!)
d)And the worst part the ending - Neo dies by cancelling himself with Smith and thus saving the people in the Matrix. In return the Machines will halt the war against the humans and those humans who want to leave the Matrix are free to do so.
At the end The Architect questions the Oracle 'how long this so-called 'peace' would last?'. She answers him by saying 'as long as it can'. The oracle questions back on whether the machines will keep their word on freeing the humans from the Matrix. The Architect sarcastically answers that he is machine and is always trustworthy unlike humans.
My question to the Architect and the Wachowski Brothers is 'Who the hell in the first place created a virtual world as a blanket to prevent humans from finding out that they are born into bondage to serve as a Duracell battery?'
Answer: Machines are also capable of deceit and when it boils down to man vs. machines the machines always should be the bad guys.

The matrix is a trilogy, not a one off film. So I wish people would stop with the They should have stopped after the first film.
The first film had possibly the best special effects the 20th century has ever seen. The 2nd and 3rd film truly brought in the 21st century.
The 3rd film on the other hand I found to be the most anticipated in the world. The Neo VS Smith Showdown and the end of the trilogy was truly a calendar watcher!

The Matrix Revolutions had dazzling special effects and entertainment.
The only thing I strongly didn't approve of is the ending.
I would like to have seen the hailed destruction of the matrix and the entire human race set free into the real world.
The Neo VS Smith Showdown was what I personally was most anticipating. It was wonderful. I felt my expectations were more than fulfilled, and enjoyed it from beginning to end.
The massive machine VS human showdown in Zion was a huge CGI scene.
The third installment has the most special effects in the trilogy and to what I've seen in all of film history.

1893360,1,B00009W2GQ,"Neil the Hippy from British sitcom ""The Young Ones"" uttered those immortal words, and he could have been explaining what was so awful about the final instalment of the Matrix trilogy.

By not saying much and implying a great deal with a huge amount of style, the thinnest veiled reference to Rene Descartes and some very snappy kung fu sequences, the Wachowski brothers made a certified classic of motion picture history in ""The Matrix"".

The Matrix Reloaded revealed more, but still mostly just hinted at great depth of learning and profundity. Many - myself included - were sufficiently taken in to declare the film a success, and noted that even if the philosophising was cod, it was a hell of a car chase. Knowing what I now know, I still think reloaded was, on the balance, a successful film.

But the Matrix Revolutions? Oh dear, oh dear. (What follows might contain ""spoilers"" - but to my mind what the real spoiling here was carried out by L and A Wachowski).

In any case, gone are the clever insinuations (for example that Merovingian might be the devil because his wife is Persephone - as in wife of Hades, lord of the underworld in Greek Mythology) and instead you're thumped between the eyes with the fact (this time, the elevator button to his floor is marked ""HELL"".)

Gone is any semblance of continuity from the last film. Persephone is back with Merovingian, despite seemingly irreconcileable differences. Merovingian is running some sort of S&M club. The indestructible albino dreadlock dudes are gone. He employs a train man, for no obvious purpose (other than to bamboozle and perplex). There is a confusing sequence with an Indian family who meets Neo while waiting at at underground station.

And there is way, way, way too much pointless fighting. Now I like a good punch-up as much as the next man, but there needs to be some raison d'etre, or at least some outcome, for crying out loud.

In place of the grand car chase we have an action finale that is such a blitzkrieg of overheating pentium processors, gattling guns and exploding squids, that for twenty minutes for all you know your TV might be on the blink (what an irony that so much computing horsepower and intricate programming leads to such an incoherent visual spectacle). And at the end of it the squids just leave as a result of a conversation taking place hundreds of miles away. Dramatically satisfying it ain't.

Finally, the whole intellectual superstructure of the trilogy reveals itself to be so much horse manure. what you thought you understood no longer make sense; the pseudo-religious angle is ditched; central tensions betweeen characters are undermined, characters die and come back to life; characters turn out to be immortal and not susceptible of being killed (which defeats the purpose of fighting, non?) and in any case you really just couldn't care a hill of beans for any of them, least of all Larry Fishburne.

The most pernicious aspect is that by throwing in the philosophical towel, Revolutions undermines the previous instalments of the trilogy which, until you see this one, had for the most part, got away with it.

As they would say in Britain, complete and utter pants.

Millions upon millions must have been excited about the second movie. And what a let down in was. It dragged and dragged, and the zion sequences were almost embarrising. If being a survivor means growing dreads and going to a rave each night, well i think i would rather pass.....
then came the third. I really hoped they would have learned from the previous film, but unfortunately, what they produced was a film way worse than the 2nd. I would advise any matrix virgin to just watch the first one and not bother with the rest.",1078358400,6,924,4.538922155688622

I think I can say I was honestly disappointed in this movie, based on its predecesors success.  Too much CGI, too much philosophy, too much.  Less is more; the Wachowski brothers and George Lucas would do well to realize that great technology does not equate to great film making.

Giving my reasons bluntly would be a huge spoiler for the film itself, so I can't do it, except for to say that this is the only - and I mean the only - film that has ever had me curled up into a ball and sobbing like a child.
Seriously. I cried until I had a mild asthma attack, first time I saw this. I had tried not to cry all through the particular scene that tears me up, but I just couldn't do it. Someone in the row behind me laughed and I almost KOd him. The first seven times I've seen this, uncontrollable weeping.
But having said that, I do love the film. It's got so many undertones, and despite what I read in an earlier review, it isn't to show that there's 'one truth', but many. I'm an atheist, but the Matrix trilogy does something to me that's impossible to explain without religious terminology. And I'm in love with Trinity.

1893371,1,B00009W2GQ,"Let this review target the common viewer who loved the original Matrix for what it was, a great action movie.  In my opinoin, although the second Matrix got a little complex, it at least delivered the incredible action scenes that we all craved.  From the highway scene to the Mr. Smith showdown, it was for lack of a better phrase, ""action-packed.""  Personally, I was even pleased with the philosophical content that it carried over from the first Matrix.
Revolutions, however, is the read-headed step child of the Matrix trilogy.  From the time the movie begins to the end, you are asking yourself, ""What in the hell is going on?""  Although the story fits with everything from the first two, it seems as if it was just thrown together.  Characters assume roles as if we are supposed to already know who they are, with no explanation or meaning even.  Fight scenes and scenes in the Matrix are limited, and all of a sudden the war becomes the main focus of the movie; who really cared about the war in Zion (like we haven't already seen enough futuristic war movies...against machines of all things)?
If you are thristing for more of Neo breaking the rules of the Matrix, watch the first two over again.  If you waste your time on this movie, you might find yourself asking, ""Why did they ruin such a great trilogy?""  In my opinion the answer is that they forced the third one.  It seems to me that everything was slopily thrown together and shoved into the market for distribution.  I know that there are a lot of good reviews for this movie on Amazon, but let me say it once again: If you are the common viewer that enjoyed Matrix for it's mind-blowing action, then leave this one for the Star Trek and Dungeons and Dragons fans.",1077321600,14,1732,4.554838709677419

This is my favourite film after THE LORD OF THE RINGS:THE RETURN OF THE KING,which is the best film I have ever seen.
The story of the film is this(don't worry,no spoilers!):
After Neo's mysterious victory over the Sentinel,his mind is trapped in a programm between the Matrix,and the real world. As for his body, he is(in a comma aucorse)in the real world.
Unable to use his special powers to escape,his survival rests on the hands of Trinity,Morpheus,and Seraph,who begin their own quest inside the Matrix.
Meanwhile,one of Smith's clones who managed to arrive at the real world is in a comma,but because of his different form(he has been installed in the body of Bane),no one even suspects his true identity.
As for the soldiers  of Zion,loaded with huge robots under their control,they wait for a giagantic attack from the Sentinels to Zion.
The script is very well written(unlike THE MATRIX RELOADED you never get bored),the directors have done a wonderfull job with the scenes,and as for the special effects,they're much better then RELOADED-Remember how awfull the fases of the Smiths looked during the Burly Brawl scene,in RELOADED? Well,in this movie,forget that. Here all of Smith's faces look just perfect and normal.
As for the Super Burly Brawl(I think that's how they named that scene),it's the best action scene I have EVER seen.

There was no way, and I do mean NO WAY it could have possibly lived up to the ridiculous expectations.  Then you have people calling a 300 million dollar grossing movie a dissapointment, and short lead time into the 3rd installment.  Sure Revolutions only made 140 million domestically, and heres why -  I think it is funny that people say the Wachaowskis mailed it in or just made these movies to grab cash.  These movies took between 4-5 years to put together.  They spent over 250 million on Reloaded and Revolutions.  That being said, these movies are NOT perfect but, most of the negative reviews of this movie look like they were written before the movie hit theaters.  Probably the biggest mistake the Wachowskis made, or whoever made this decision, was the decision to put Revolutions our 6 months after Reloaded.  We waited 5 years for Reloaded, I think a May 2004 release for Revolutions would have done wonders for box office receipts and critics who were probably saying, didn't I just review a Matrix movie 5 minutes ago?  I went in with low expectations because of the ridiculously overly critical reveiws.  What I got was a very good ending to one of the best trilogies of our time.

The second one was bad, but at least, there was the hope that all questions would be answered, making this a decent two-picture story.  So what did the Wachowski brothers do?  They started by removing everything entertaining from the 1st one, like decent music, a comprehensible plot, and characters we cared about.  They answered no questions brought up in the second movie, apparently leaving it up to your imagination to fill in the gaps.  They tried to tell a story that did not conform to anything that had been previously set up.

If you find surrealism in art and literature (or in this case movies) to be lacking in your taste, this movie is not for you - not all questions are answered, and you are left to make your own deductions.  As everyone who worked the project stated in interviews ""You will get out of this [Matrix Revolutions and the trilogy] exactly what you put into it.""
With the combination of philosophy orriginating from the Tao Teh Ching, and works from philosophers like Rene Descartes, the fusion of sociology from those of the likes of Jean Baudrillard and Kevin Kelly, with a twist of cyber/goth underground culture and fads make this a deeply eclectic, mind bending, and visually stimulating work.

The beginning was very good but when you get to the ""War Scene"" you will literily be at the edge of your seat.  You will be so happy walking out of a movie like this.  What makes this movie interesting is, unlike ""Matrix Reloaded"" this had a point to it.  People say that ""Matrix Reloaded"" was ""all action, no thinking"".  I liked the movie but that was actually what it was.
When I saw ""Matrix Revolutions"" it just blew me away.  It had everything a movie could ask for, Romance, Thrills, Action, Comedy, and even Horror.  Also another thing was that the movie had was the ""flavor"" that it was not even close to what the other Matrix films where like.  This had so much to do with all the life of zion and the thing that could happen and everything like that.
Mostly the thing that made me like this movie the best was becasue of the battle sequence it was about 15 to 20 minutes long.  I was so happy to see what would happen next in everything that they seemed to have.  This is one reason why I don't like to ""Get up in the middle of the Movie"", just like when i saw ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"".

SHORT REVIEW
I've generally lost interest in action movies.  I must admit that The Matrix was groundbreaking and superior to any action movie I'd ever seen.  But what really captivated me about The Matrix was its philosophical message.
I find the philosophical message of the sequels to be muddled if not completely lost.  In The Matrix, there was a message of hope, and Neo (and Trinity and Morpheus) stood as the potential for every person.  But as Neo becomes Superman, he becomes inaccessible.  And along the way, the message of what is *real* and the message of what is *possible* gets lost.  And that's a shame since many of us were looking for that to grow instead.
LONG REVIEW
The Matrix and Rings trilogies are worthy of comparison because of their coincidence in time and in theme. Both deal with the human struggle to conquer and with the human struggle to understand free will and Fate. But Tolkien famously disliked analogy, and his books (and the movies made by Peter Jackson) stand alone as story. We relate to the LOTR characters, but we don't need for the story or the characters to have one-to-one correspondences to our reality. CLEARLY, THE LOTR TRILOGY SUCCEEDED BUT THE MATRIX TRILOGY HAS BEEN A DISAPPOINTMENT. WHY?
The Wachowskis set out to create analogy. And we bought it with the first movie. We embraced Neo's struggle to understand what is real and what isn't, particularly the limitations and power of his own beliefs. We recognized wisdom in Morpeheus' mentoring of his crew. We embraced Trinity's passion for Neo and freedom. We spent a lot of time at the water cooler talking about what was real. WE BOUGHT INTO THE WACHOWSKI'S ATTEMPT TO TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT OURSELVES AND OUR WORLD--SOMETHING IMPORTANT ABOUT THE POWER OF BELIEF. And we saw a little Neo and a litte Trinity in ourselves--we embraced that heroism in us and that desire to be free.
BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE SECOND MOVIE, THE WACHOWSKIS LOST ME: I COULD NO LONGER MAKE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE WORLD OF THE MATRIX AND MY OWN WORLD AND BELIEFS. I think there were 3 failures in Reloaded that had to be overcome for Revolutions to work:
1) The action was no longer connected to the characters' experience of overcoming the limitations of their own beliefs. Instead, action existed merely for titillation. But we had already been conditioned by the first movie to want not just great action but great action with *purpose*. Instead of meaning being communicated via the story, we were subjected to 'speechifying' by the main characters, particularly Morpheus.
2) Neo, in particular, became unrelatable, in part because he seemed unstoppable.
3) The challenge to Neo's beliefs--was he really the master of his fate?--left us befuddled regarding what had kindled our spirits in the first movie. The fact that this challenge to Neo (and us) was left unresolved only served to disinterest us.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE THIRD MOVIE COMPLETES THE MOVE INTO ESOTERIC TERRITORY. And for that reason it's difficult to watch. It has its good moments. But I had lost interest after the second, and this one doesn't win me back. Instead, it left me more confused. For more of what was 'reality' in the first movie, the dichotomous worlds of the Matrix and the scorched earth, is confused. Even the Oracle turns out to be merely a program. AND IT IS NEVER RESOLVED WHETHER NEO HIMSELF IS JUST A COG IN THE MATRIX OR IF HE REALLY IS A FREE PERSON. The Wachowskis had excluded me from their sheik little philosophy club in Reloaded, and they didn't invite me back in Revolutions.
Ultimately, the Wachowskis embrace of the esoteric --the fact that as the creators of their own little world they seem to not have been able to decide what was real in it and what wasn't--means that they failed to create a meaningful analogy with their Matrix world. Luke Skywalker goes through hope and despair, and we understand and relate to his world and his struggle. But Neo--Neo just got too far out there for us to relate to.",1075939200,19,4301,4.8197831978319785

But, but, didn't the Oracle send Neo to find the Architect in Re-Loaded?  Wasn't that the climax of Re-Loaded?  Well, i guess they need to find some reason to go back into the Matrix.

It is a shame that The Wachowski brothers managed to waste most of the amazing potential that was created in The Matrix. To start, the pacing in this film is unbearably slow in many places. I found myself becoming very tired during many of the pre-final battle scenes; the only characters that actually have any sort of meaning attached to them are the core 3 (morpheus, trinity, neo), while a lot of time is spent on trying to quickly develop incidental characters so that cheap emotion can [try to] be drawn out of them later, but the film fails in this regard. The entire first 20 or so minutes feels like it's not even suppsoed to be there, the cliffhanger from the end of 2 is revealed, and the resolution (other than to the provide a token screen appearance for the Marovingian and the hot Persophene) is pointless and has nothing to do with the rest of the film, the information gained could have been gathered in 5 minutes. To the film's credit, it at least doesnt follow in the inane footsteps of its predecessor ""Reloaded"" and just throw in a kung-fu scene and set intervals, just so we can be oooed and aaahed, but it does manage to be incredibly cliche. Again, this is a big disappointment, after the innovation found in the Matrix. The outcome of the final battle was never truly in question, and the ""surpirse"" death at the end wasn't really surprising at all. The film just feels like it falls short completely, I wanted something much more EPIC of out it, and it was utterly unable to deliver. Morpeheus, a beacon of charisma in the first two films, has little screen time here, and when we do see him, he is meek beyond comprehension, as nothing has happened to his character to induce this. The special effects, while still impressive, are no longer able to carry the film, as they have indeed become something we have all seen before. The plot, espceially the dialouge, was maddening at times. If another person answered a question with a vague generality along the lines of ""You already know the answer..."" I was seirously going to hit the person next to me. It felt very similar to the second film's sophomoric ramblings about causality; giant holes in the film are tried to be covered up by a philosophic air (which, in all honesty, isn't done correctly, not like it could have been), and a fading sense of coolness. Compare this trilogy to the other epic trilogy of our time, The Lord of the Rings. In the Return of the King, a true sense of EPICITY is felt, at the battle of pelennor fields, at Mount Doom (Granted, Jackson had amazing material to draw from, but still); Everything this film needed to be great was in place, an epic setting (the war strewn future), with the fate of the human race at stake, and the broading of scope needed in an epic (from the original with Neo's quest to discover what the matrix is, to the culminating war in this installment), but it falls short in most every aspect. A big disappointment, that I would not recommend to others.",1075507200,11,3103,4.552772808586762
1893394,4,B00009W2GQ,"Since when did everyone who gets a computer get a MBA from NYU in Film and Theatre Arts?  I was just wondering becuase everyone wants to slam this movie and I bet a hundred bucks that atleast 75% saw Star Wars 2 and said oh yeah that sucked and bought that when it came out on DVD.  Now that se(pre)quel series sucks.  Despite the heavy influence of the New Testament in the Matrix movies, these are cinematically excellent.  Great special effects, I mean these directors sought out to make a walking talking anime movie. And they did it hands down inviting the world to both the good and the cheesy.  I don't think that they were looking for nods from the Academy critics.  If you want to have some fun and maybe be left with something to talk about with your buddies over some beers get this.  Even if you didn't see the first two,(if you didn't where have you been)no I am kidding, get it anyway, make yourself figure out all the supposedly obscure and awesome metaphor within the story.  It is about computer software.  A virus and a virus program.  Just sit back and enjoy a action movie.

"" Everything that has a beginning... has an end! "" and what an end it was! My hat is off for everyone who took part in creating this epic trilogy!",1075334400,,321,4.111111111111111
1893396,5,B00009W2GQ,"I understand that the movie is not nearly comparable to the original Matrix which was one of the greatest Sci-Fi concepts ever presented in a movie, and the first film was in deed superb. The first film changed the world of cinema, but the last two definitely lacked the magic of the first.
  But Reloaded and Revolutions are still good. Perhaps they disappointed so many because in deed they didn't deliver the same story quality of the first. Expectations were to high and the result wasn't a master piece like the Lord of the Rings Trilogy case (where each movie delivered something new and exiting - plus a better cast, crew and story connections through the 3 movies by far).
  There are both good and bad critics about this one and I'm among the ones that loved it but recognize it has its flaws and not everyone liked it with good reasons. What most people that didn't like it criticized was that the movie left some story arcs unanswered and felt more like a forced sequel.
  The movie didn't answer everything with the intention of making us think and give it the interpretation we wish. That's why there are so many interpretations to it, it has so many layers that it would take more than just one good chat to understand all the meanings of the matrix.
  This third installment didn't have more kung fu, or philosophical speech than the first two, it rather had more symbolisms throughout not only the actions and reactions of the characters but also through  the concepts used.
  Something people should consider is that according to Joel Silver, Reloaded and Revolutions are the same movie cut in half, which gives a different perspective to Revolutions if only analyzed alone. With that in consideration, the movie feels better.
  This movie is about an end, death, finding a meaning for life, fighting, truth, etc. But it is not a movie about conclusion. The answers given in Revolutions lead to more questions because in the end it is about believing rather than knowing. After all, if you knew everything, what would be the point?
  Revolutions has some incredible special effects scenes and sound. The lightening is quite good along with all the technical aspects of the film. The CGI is better used that in Reloaded, but there was a terrible flaw, the screen felt saturated. I believe this was a mistake of the cinematographer, the camera angles were not right for the massive shots, and things like the sentinels were difficult to follow to the point a feeling of ""yeah right... I got it, what's next..."" crossed my mind.
  The chemistry between Neo and Trinity is also a little lacking. The mayor story arc is well resolved, but I don't know if it was a matter of the actors or the directors that the chemistry was just missing.
  I still give the film 5 star out of the love for the concept introduced by the first film and what I felt was an improvement to Reloaded. The movie has strong points and delivered interesting things... but still lacked the sense of a masterpiece the first had, which disappointed many.

They're just upset because they can't figure out what the story is about. The story of the Matrix is very unique and allows us to question humanity and its many fallacies. If I was able to give this movie more than 5 stars, I would do it immediately.
What captivated me about this installment is - obviously - the visuals. Just watching the humans strapped in their APUs battling in a desperate fight to save humanity against millions of machines and watching the Hammer racing towards Zion while warding off Sentinels reminded me of the epic space battles of the ""Star Wars"" movies. The battle between Neo and Agent Smith easily outdoes their quarrel in the previous movie, as Smith has gained more power inside the Matrix.

Looking into the bible, it was Christ who sacrificed himself to cleanse the world of sin. Many of the characters have different meanings. The Merovingian for example represents Satan. Watch what button Morpheus presses in the elevator the leads to his club. It says ""HELL"". Even looking at it from a computer standpoint, Neo let Smith infect him so the machines could lock on and destroy Smith. Thats how a computer destroys a virus.

I walked out of the theatre with a terrible taste in my mouth caused by the saccharine, fake ending and over-blown effects. Did George Lucas have a hand in these two movies? The grotesque sentinel war at the gates of Zion was just sick: as the machines stood firing at the sentinels pouring in, the Matrix saga was effectively pummeling itself to death.
The only redeemable scenes from these monstrosities was the car chase from ""Reloaded"" and the rain cinematography of the Smith-Neo fight in this one (the fight itself was rehashed). It seems sad that the last two movies did nothing to answer the millions of questions we had, but rather added more. But ultimately, we could not care less about the answers.

Each film has something differant about it that will make it cherished forever. The first movie in the series, ""The Matrix"", had a fantastic plot and origional comcepts with compelling drama and action! The second film, ""The Matrix Reloaded"", was in my opinion more fun than the first, even though you could not fully understand the plot with out seeing the third film, but the action was fantastic and plentiful. Now for the third film, ""The Matrix Revolutions"". Some people complain that this was a bad movie and I really hate it when thy do, because it is not! They did not like the battle, well hello what did you expect a negoations between humans and machines! There had to be a battle because they said it ever since the first movie!

1893408,4,B00009W2GQ,"Many will argue and debate that there shouldn't have even been a Matrix trilogy, I'm not going into that here, because if you're reading this, you're at least interested in the movies.
Revolutions picks up immediately after the ending of Reloaded, and does much to combat the pain many of us felt after seeing Reloaded. Basically, Neo is stuck in a sort of Netherworld, neither the ""real world"", nor the Matrix, and Trinity is tapped to get him out. Meanwhile, the Machines are coming to Zion, in massive force, while Zion prepares for the attack. During all of this Agent Smith is rapidly taking over everyone plugged into the Matrix, thus becoming even more powerful. The movie climaxes in a massive battle between the Machines and Zion, and between Neo and Smith.
And now, on to at least my opinion of it. No, it's not the original, but it succeeds where Reloaded failed (these two movies should have been 1 long movie anyways). There's far more character work in this film than in Reloaded. It's emotionally satisfying, even if the outcome isn't exactly the one you were expecting. The paceing is pretty rapid, there's very little that seems extraneous, and the CGI and action in the battle for Zion is simply jaw-dropping.  There's also a lot of closure in this film, for the characters, for the main story, and for us the viewing audience.

Well, guess what, friends: if anyone had really paid attention to the first film, you would have gotten the clear message that, actually, it WAS about an impending war. In fact, the third film really could not have been anything else than what it was - the logical conclusion to the various threads set up in the first two films.
It is not always necessary to look for newer, better cheap thrills - this is one of the curses of our present culture. What is necessary is to complete the story correctly - and, personally, I think that's exactly what has been given in this film.
One can debate the totality of the films' various ""philosophical"" and ""mystical"" animae - but, for me, the enjoyment of all three  derives from the totality of its architecture, the completeness of its vision. I'm not really interested in searching for ""deep meanings"" from comic books ""come to life."" I take the three films together as a remarkably congent fantasy - done with much tongue-in-cheek. Shakespeare or Pirandello or Henry James it isn't - but, then again, neither is Flash Gordon, Star Wars or even the LOTR cycle for all of that series' gravitas.

The plot finds Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and the Zionites still fighting a never-ending battle against the Machines. Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) still wears that infamous smirk, and the Oracle (Mary Alice replacing the late Gloria Foster) still chain-smokes and bakes cookies.
Despite all its superbly-choreographed fight scenes and mind-blowing computer graphics, ""Revolutions"" fails in its way of telling the story. The biggest problem I had with was its climax. It really should've ended with Neo defeating the Machines and Agent Smith(s) at the same time. That ""treaty"" crap made me frown. Trinity's death was somewhat laughable. Hugo Weaving's acting (while excellent in the first two installments) was pathetically whiny.

1893424,5,B00009W2GQ,"Hi! I will begin with the obvious. When it comes to being one of those ""Die hard"" fans,I am indeed-BUSTED!!! I was, at first disappointed with Reloaded. Evidently, these 2nd and 3rd parts to The Matrix are the type of movie I've stumbled upon once or twice in my life. These are the types of movies in which I learn and understand more with each viewing. Reloaded didn't take long to become a very special movie for me. The day it FINALLY came to my local IMAX Theater was indeed the day I left the theater with a good old fashion adrenyline rush. It blew my hair back-totally! When I saw Revolutions the day it was released, it kind of bummed me out that Trinity did not open the picture with one of her mind-blowing-and interest provoking stunts. Bravo Carrie-Anne Moss! Anyhow, I thought that Revolutions was most definitely THE most moving, emotionally speaking of course, than any of the three films. By the time Revolutions rolled around, and into our lives,it may have been just me-but I believe for most of the Matrix fans had, by then, grown a strong emotional attachment to the three main characters. Neo, Trinity and Morpheus were like old friends to us by then, and the scene both in the nightclub where Trinity proves her love for Neo, as well as the short conversation she had with Neo, prior to his ""ultimate battle"", if you will, brought closure to us all. When I say ""us all"", I mean the fans that were there from beginning to end-who were not empty-headed and could comprehend the philosophies as well as the pre-meditated world of the computerized Matrix-it's appearance, which ""A lesser mind"" could not pick up on (does greenish tinting ring a bell?)the hidden visual effects and the many wonders which, in our world have yet to be explained; aliens, werewolves, deja-vu's, among other things. The blue coloration within and around the ships as well as most parts of Zion. When I first heard on the promotions for Revolutions...""EVERYTHING THAT HAS A BEGINNING HAS AN END"" indeed made me very sad. I'll never be the same again after The Matrix.  You know why?

If anybody says they liked the first one and not Revolutions, they most certainly missed something.
Some say it was devoid of emotion and overloaded with special effects.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If the seemingly inevitable slaughter of thousands of people and the efforts to save them is not emotional, my friend, I would say you have no feelings.  And the battle against the sentinels with the giant APU units was breathtaking. I was especially moved by Neo's decision to go into the heart of the machine world in the flesh.  Think of how this ties into the first one!  Neo could only go there because of how he destroyed Agent Smith at the end of the first movie.  Smith became such a problem; that was Neo's bargaining chip.  So you see, it's all good.  It didn't suddenly change, like many say.

If you are expecting a sound resolution to the problematic relationship between humans and machines that we first learned of in ""The Matrix"", you won't get that either. Oddly, the fate of greater humanity, the humans living in the Matrix, has been abandoned entirely.
""Revolutions"" is heavier on action than ""Reloaded"". -Literally heavy. This is a movie about heavy artillery. And it works better than ""Reloaded"" on that level. ""Revolutions"" suffers from the same mediocrity in cinematography, costumes, and music as ""Reloaded"" did. And I think the makeup is actually bad. We notice these things because the first movie excelled in these areas, as well as in many others. The film is sometimes bogged down by annoyingly verbose computer programs. (Why is it that whenever artificial life forms are featured in science fiction they have diarrhea of the mouth?) And the Wachowski Brothers  have now officially joined George Lucas and James Cameron as big budget action directors who can't write dialogue but insist on doing it anyway. The dialogue is insufferable. But I don't detect as much sloppy editing or plain poor judgment in ""Revolutions"" as there was in ""Reloaded"". And where ""Reloaded"" suffered from having no real villain, ""Revolutions"" has happily restored Agent Smith to nemesis status. Unfortunately, like its predecessor, ""Revolutions"" elicits laughs in all the wrong places. Once again, the fight sequences fall flat. But they are better integrated into the plot than they were in ""Reloaded"". (To see in a nutshell the vast difference in quality between this movie and the original, compare the gun battle at the entrance to the Frenchman's club to the lobby scene in ""The Matrix"". The latter was energetic and beautiful. ""Revolutions"" version is dismal, grotesque, and over-produced.) But  overall ""Revolutions"" is a slightly better film than ""Reloaded"" was. It is better constructed and, although all semblance of thoughtfulness has been abandoned, it works better as a straight action film than ""Reloaded"". The extended battle for Zion has some exciting moments, and I wasn't actually bored at any point during the film.
After seeing ""Reloaded"", I got the impression that ""The Matrix"" trilogy had been conceived in two parts, but the second part had been stretched into two movies with the addition of a lot of filler material. Having seen ""Revolutions"", I  still have this impression. But go see how the story ends. ""The Matrix: Revolutions"" is an entertaining shoot 'em up, but just isn't much beyond that.",1073433600,3,3446,5.161001788908766
1893441,5,B00009W2GQ,"There's a reason that the Matrix sequels have failed to become widely-beloved movies, and it has very little to do with the quality of the movies themselves.  It really depends on what you thought of the first movie in the trilogy.
So, rather than do a traditional review of this movie, I'm going to list all the reasons that you, personally, would or would not like it.  (My own opinion should be obvious already from the 5-star rating, so I'm not going to go on and on about how mind-blowing and fun this movie is.)
You would probably NOT like this movie if...
1) You watch a lot of anime and hate it when Hollywood incorporates (""borrows"") elements from it.  Specifically if you watch a lot of Dragon Ball Z--you will probably end up feeling like ""The Matrix"" is just a rehash of old ideas.
2) You felt that the original Matrix movie was the most intelligent movie of the last twenty years and merits its own religion.
3) You felt that the original Matrix was very unique and original and you believed that there was a lot of intellectual subtext that made it brilliant.
4) You don't like action movies, or are not in the mood for an action movie.
You probably WILL like this movie if...
1) You felt that the original Matrix was a success because it was a good action movie with enough style to be different.
2) You can get into a very traditional good-versus-evil story quite easily.
3) You feel that the intellectual subtext to any of the Matrix movies was really just a side dish and not the main course.
4) Fire + guns = good.
I've described ""Revolutions"" to friends as being the most loyal sequel I have ever seen; it pays off all the mysteries that the prequels set up, it uses the exact same formula that ""The Matrix"" used, and it is written/directed/acted in the exact same way.  Yet this loyalty is the ultimate cause of the movie's failure.  It's like trying to distribute your love--you only have a limited amount, and if you give the original Matrix all of it, then you have none left for the sequels (especially ""Revolutions"").",1073088000,4,2043,4.495956873315364
1893442,3,B00009W2GQ,"Man the first two movies were off the chain.  The third movie was actually very good all the way until the end.  The point was to destroy the matrix but that didn't happen.  The machines still rule over the human race and the machines still call all the shots.  This was one of the dumbest endings to a trilogy ever.  It went from destroy the Matrix to destroy Smith.  Smith is evil and can transform everything he touches to evil.  Neo is good and lets Smith transform himself and all his clones into him transforming everything back to good.  How stupid?  The ending made the first two movies basically irrelevant and all their actions ( and my time )wasted motions.  The point was to get rid of the Matrix.  The Matrix still exists...WHY?...stupid.  Well at least we have the masterpiece that is The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy which they actually accomplished what they set out to do...the ring doesn't exist anymore it is destroyed--exactly what they set out to do in the Fellowship.  This was a bust.
What were they fighting for if the Matrix still exists?  They was gearing up for war and all this and that but guess what nothing was accomplished...all of em died.  And at the end the people's choice was to either stay in the 'Matrix' or be freed.  Well....judging by the conditions the freed live in...keep me in the Matrix...at least I won't be eating mush mush regurgitated refried bean soup and live in rags.  At least I won't get killed believing the Matrix was gonna get destroyed but in reality nothing happened.
And another thing...since when can machines talk?  How can Neo see without his eyes in the real world?  How can he destroy machines by just putting his hand up in the real world?  And also the only character worth caring about dies.  We still don't know what happened to Neo...they just raise him up and that's it?  Why would the machines care what happens to the matrix they would still heavily outnumber the human race, slaughter them, and then create a new matrix...so what was the point of inserting Neo back into the matrix in the first place?

1893445,4,B00009W2GQ,"First off, I thought the Matrix trilogy was excellent, minus a few sorted details. The concept shown in the first edition of the world of the matrix, was well done to say the least.
When I went to see Reloaded when it came out, I was having mixed feelings of what to expect from it. But I thought that the action scenes with the highway chase, Neo in the hallway with the whole bullet time thing, and lets not forget Neo and the multiple Smiths hacking it out in the streets, was well done and I was really impressed with the whole storyline and how they thickened the plot after the first movie. If I had to choose my favourite of the three I would definately say Reloaded purely because I thought it was the most well done of the three.
Revolutions was a memorable and worthy conclusion to the trilogy but it was my least favourite of the three. I thought the battle scenes at Zion with the machines was incredible and definately worth seeing in theatres, and the storyline was fitting with Reloaded and continuing onto Revolutions, considering Revolutions picked up right where Reloaded left off. My only problem with the whole trilogy pretty much, was the last fifteen minutes or so of Revolutions. The storyline got kind of confusing, not in the sense of not understanding what was going on so much as why the Wachowskis tied it up like that. The ending seemed kind of rushed, and some parts even ridiculous. Trinity dying isn't something I would have wrote in if I had wrote the ending, but I understand why she did, because it makes sense with the whole theme of the two conclusions. However, I was disappointed with what they did with her character. And regarding Neo, I was more pissed off with what they did with him rather than confused with the small questions it left everyone with. But still, COME ON. What, is he just supposed to sit there in the machine world for the rest of his life, or just a few decades and maybe then consider returning to Zion? And even if he does go back to Zion, hows he going to get there? Feel his way back?
Even so, an excellent trilogy, despite the few rushed and some-what ridiculous final minutes, and its worth seeing all three movies anyways. I know I'm going to buy them when they all come out. Why let the last few minutes ruin the whole thing?",1072742400,3,2295,4.453681710213777

In ""the animatrix"" it shows that, it shows the ship that they got messages from, being destroyed. ""Enter the Matrix"" shows the transformation of the oracle, Capt Niobe retrieviving information not mentioned in the movies.  I think ""Revolutions"" was a great movie but, it did leave alot unanswered, and this is not and ending if you remember the conversation of the artitect and the oracle, this is merely a ""hold up for a while"" until we bring something else, it's not a finish.

All that I could say when I got out of the theater was: ""Better than the best movie of all time...the first one.""
  Revolutions contains action, suspense, thrills, chills, romance, and any other genre you can think of.  It is getting many bad reviews, however, worldwide.  Why is this?  Because you have to be of a unique mindset to like it.  The original Matrix was much broader of an audience, touching to the nerds and the action-lovers...for people who didn't even understand it, it was awesome.  The reason Revolutions isn't doing as well even though it is considered by me to be even better is because it requires quite a bit of intelligence to enjoy thoroughly.

And all that is standing in your way of the most highly anticipated film in years is the massive swarm of people ahead of you. Who would have thought a relatively small film called The Matrix in 1999 would eventually spawn one of the greatest film series in movie history? When the original film grossed $171 million at the domestic box office and became a huge cult favorite on DVD, Warner Brothers quickly jumped at the opportunity to role the (supposedly) final two sequels. It took the Wachowski brothers nearly four years and $300 million but the journey is almost over. There are many questions to ask before seeing Revolutions that one must ask himself: How will it end? Will I understand it? Will everything be answered? Can this truly be the final Matrix film? But the most important question to ask may be the most irrelevant: Do we really want it to end? Surely the Warner Brothers executives know their answer.
The story centers once again on the journey of The One (Neo) as he tries to end the war between man and machine after years of conflict. Revolutions picks up exactly where Reloaded left off earlier this year but here is a recap:
Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus lead the human resistance against the machine world for control of the world. For years, the machines have kept human kind plugged into The Matrix, a simulated dream world, and threatened to destroy the last human city known as Zion. Morpheus believes that their journey is almost at an end but there are some that stand in the way of providence. Namely Agent Smith, who was once destroyed by Neo but now has come back to destroy him and everything else. In the final scene of the film, both Neo and Smith (in human form) have been knocked unconscious just as the machines prepare to invade Zion.
Got it? If you don't then too bad because here we go. Without giving too much away, let's just say everything seems to come full circle. As the humans within Zion prepare to duke it out for control of the world against the machines, Neo goes to the machine city to work out a compromise and stop Smith before it is too late for both man and machine. Did you get confused during Reloaded and hate it for that? Then you're not going to like Revolutions. There is a lot to divulge within the course of the two hour feature and Revolutions will require multiple viewings to unlock all the secrets of The Matrix franchise. Outside of the confusing interlocking concepts, does Revolutions deliver a good plot? Though the beginning starts off a little too slow, the rest of the film smoothes out any rough edges and ends the series with a bang.
Most of the cast (outside of a relative few additional members) is the same as it was with The Matrix Reloaded. But in Revolutions, some perform better then others. Keanu Reeves delivers the goods with his role as The One (Neo). Reeves may seem relatively stiff in the film but that is the point. As Smith becomes more and more human, so Neo becomes more and more machine like and acts that way. Reeves does a fabulous job in dragging that point out though many will probably not pick up on that fact. Carrie-Ann Moss takes on the role of Trinity for the final time but isn't as featured as she was in Reloaded, which is both good and bad. The good? The focus of Revolutions is suppose to be on Neo and that is the point. The bad? She has some scenes but not the way many will want her to go out on. The biggest highlight of Revolutions is not the special effects (though they come in a close second) but rather is the performance of Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. Weaving is so over the top with this role that it is just absolutely amazing to watch especially in the final battle sequence between Smith and Neo in the rain. So what is bad? Monica Belluci's Persephone has no point in this film, let alone the entire Matrix series. What does her character do that is of any real importance? Nothing other then bring them the Keymaker in Reloaded but still, what is her purpose? And the biggest disappointment comes from the lack of Morpheus. He is barely shown in the film and deserved more screen time then he got.
Overall, Revolutions may not end the franchise in the way everybody would want but the final confrontation between Smith and Neo at the end is worth the price of admission alone. Does the final film answer all the questions? Thankfully, No. Would anybody really be satisfied if all the answers were given to them on a silver platter with no thought put into divulging the film series' secrets for themselves? No. Will multiple viewing be required to fully understand it? Yes but if you don't feel like paying the price of admission then you will only have to wait till at least May for the DVD. Many will leave the theater disappointed and, in certain aspects, they should. Granted, you had to expect that the film would not end with a picture perfect happy ending like you would want but the ending that is given just doesn't serve the film justice. Some fans will feel cheated, some will feel empty, while others will be too blown away from the battle sequences to fully comprehend or care about the real ending. The final scene of the film is one of those either you love or hate kind of things with no area in between. Bottom line is that Revolutions performs better then Reloaded but doesn't end the franchise the way it should have. How will you feel? That is up to you but like the Oracle says in the film, ""We can't see past the choices we don't understand"". So grasp the concept of the film before making your final evaluation.",1071360000,6,5729,4.478011472275335

In all honesty, I think they should have done the first movie and left it alone after that.  The first movie was amazingly good, fun action sequences, intriguing storyline, great characters.. but the second and third just don't compare.
The action scenes in both the second and third movie were amazing, but most of them did nothing to further the storyline.  The plot seemed juvenile and at times was boring.  Characters were introduced that really did nothing for the storyline (ie: the train man) and the last movie especially focused far too much on secondary characters.
I saw the Matrix Reloaded and I didn't hate it, but it didn't impress me like the first one did.  But after seeing Revolutions.. I was disappointed and angry.  The ending made no sense to me, the film spent too much time revolving around characters that I didn't care about.  I expected the third movie to be mostly about Neo, Trinity and Morphious.. which it didn't.

They decided to abort on the ""Ghost"" characters, put two minutes of dialouge with The Architect and drop the characters? Give me a break!

1893459,3,B00009W2GQ,"The incredible phenomenon of ""The Matrix"" that hit theaters in 1999 was a landmark film that defined and redefined what we know about science-fiction/action movies and the special effects that can be employed.  The minds behind the madness, the Wachowski brothers, decided to capitalize on the first film's enormous popularity by creating two sequels (""The Matrix: Reloaded"" and this one, ""The Matrix: Revolutions"") to complete a spectacular trilogy.  To avoid the pitfalls of making fans waits ridiculous amounts of time between each sequel (like the ""Star Wars"" prequels), the Wachowskis decided to film ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" at the same time with the intention of releasing them about a half a year apart (""Lord of the Rings"" director, Peter Jackson, employed this same strategy).  Unfortunately, due to onset tragedies and unforeseen delays, the sequels didn't appear until four years after the original, at least a year and a half later than was intended.  Still, the first sequel, ""The Matrix: Reloaded"", did a credible job of continuing and expanding the story begun in the original.  The meta-philosophical gobble-de-gook didn't bog down that film due to its awe-inspiring and relevant action sequences.  With a bit of a cliffhanger, the table was set for the final part of the trilogy, ""The Matrix: Revolutions"" to end this saga with a spectacular flourish.  Alas, ""Revolutions"" turns out to be a mixed bag.  It still provides some awe-inspiring battles, but the discussions get more arcane than in the previous film, and there are some plot developments late in the film that seem to go against everything that has led to this point and create a decidedly unsatisfying and incomplete conclusion.

""The Matrix: Reloaded"" ended with Neo (Keanu Reaves) trapped somewhere in between the Matrix and human world as the result of using some newfound human powers.  While Neo tries to find his way back to the real world, the humans must still contend with the deadly armada of sentinels still drilling towards Zion in an attempt to exterminate the humans.  After some garbled philosophical discussions, including wasted appearances by Merovingian and Persephone, Neo returns to the real world and a decision is made on what must be done.  After much discussion and arguing, Neo and his lover, Trinity, take one of the human ships to go towards the machines' main city and try and defeat them there, while the remaining humans (such of Morpheus, et al) take the remaining ship and rush back to Zion in an attempt to provide some help during the inevitable battle with the sentinels.  The stage has been set for some truly dramatic developments and, indeed, much of what happens over the next hour is quite compelling and dramatic.  Neo and Trinity's approach to the machine city is a technological marvel.  Much is revealed about the structure and extent of the surface of Earth.  Many miles below the surface the tension of waiting for the sentinel armada is palpable.  Once the battle starts, it becomes a mind-bending sensory assault of images that at once seem to clutter the screen, but never become so indistinct that you cannot tell what is happening.  In terms of technical achievement, the Battle for Zion may be second only to the freeway battle in ""Reloaded"".

Unfortunately, there is more to the movie than this, and the last 30-45 minutes is both ponderous and frustrating.  It is very tempting to reveal the final plot twists so that you can understand the confounding left-turn this film takes, but in the interests of not playing spoiler, I won't.  I will put forth that this does create a decidedly unsatisfying ending, though.  This is truly disappointing, because the ""Matrix"" trilogy had the potential to completely redefine the definitions of existence and, perhaps, even spawn a new school of philosophical thought.  It just seems as though the Wachowskis got too clever for their own good and the trilogy ends up being less than the some of its parts.  ""The Matrix: Revolutions"" is not a bad movie.  Its actions sequences are enough to grant it three stars.  However, it is my belief that, in time, the original ""Matrix"" will be viewed on its own as a truly great film, with two sequels being thought of as frustrating and necessary additions.",1070841600,6,4275,5.011315417256012

It begins with both Neo and the other guy lying on two stretchers - out cold, trapped in the cyberspace of ""the Matrix"". Trinity, Morpheus and the others are trying to revive them, to return them intact to Zion. The next scene is Neo at a train station ... talking to an Indian couple and a little girl of about 4 years old. They are waiting for the 'trainmaster' who will help them return to the 'real world', for them it is the one created by machines. Neo learns, the little girl, is Seti, their daughter, whom they love ... but she is a program, who can be deleted. Neo discovers how ""love"" transcends *even* the programming of machines. Neo finds out the trainman works for the Frenchman, the Frenchman controls their fate ... the trains is due, but it is late ... How does Neo escape this trap, of being caught in a purgatorial existence, not really belonging to either the world of Zion or the one created by the machines? The scenes are phenomenal. Naturally, he makes it out, with the help of his friends ...
Zion plans for the inevitable invasion by the machines. The humans prepare a few surprises of their own ... indescribable combat scenes, indescribable special effects. I sat with clenched teeth and tense muscles, as swarms of insect-like and squid-like machines zoomed and descended into Zion. The fighting scenes are some of the best I have ever viewed ... When the Oracle is consulted we learn the simple but hard truth, that she does not predict anything, she provides information and those who summon her help ""make a choice"" based on their ""belief"" in themselves. Neo and Trinity leave in a ship -- with a stow-away on board ... Neo ""believes"" in his abilities after a tragic occurrence. Neo does what must be done ... you have to see the film to know what that is and how the film ends. This film is *highly* recommended. Of the three films, this is my favorite. One must view all three to fully appreciate and understand why the Matrix series is so popular and appealing. Erika Borsos (erikab93)",1070668800,9,2495,4.698630136986301
1893472,4,B00009W2GQ,"Well this being my first foray into the world of reviewing, I apologize for my inexperience ahead of time.  I hope that as I continue to review Movies/Books/DVD's and all other medium, that you will enjoy my comtemporary views towards all things entertainment.  I will also promise to be brief and with my reviews...as I only read the reviews that do not dilly dally but get to the point..........The Matrix Revolutions along with Matirx Reloaded, it's predecessor, are one big great movie.  Yes Reloaded and Revolutions are nothing more than a very long movie.  I know that most of you have read the other 335 reviews so I won't go into as much detail as I normally would...so i will get to my inner voice early..  The whole trilogy is a conglomorate of:  The Bible, The Dune Series, and many more other books(told you i was brief).  Original this film is not.  SO don't try to make this into something it isnt.  It is the story of the messianic choice...to sacrifice ones self for the greater good of human kind.  It all comes down to choice.  The oracle is not omnipresciant.  She only offers the path and Neo must ""choose"" which path to travel.  As this is the total underlying theme to the movie (and if you know the theme) you will enjoy the film.  But!!! If you are looking for closure and resolution to the film then you might want to look elsewhere.  This film ends with the filmakers giving the audience a choice.  You must choose what you got out of the film.",1070323200,2,1470,4.490566037735849
1893473,5,B00009W2GQ,"This was an excellent movie with very few flaws. It is a great ending for a series that otherwise would not have made sense. Matrix and Reloaded were excellent too, yet in different ways. Matrix opened up the philosophy of what the story was about while Reloaded focused mainly on visual appeal to the audience. Revolutions was a great finish to a great series. It's just too bad that Neo gets his butt kicked (unlike the first two parts).",1070323200,2,439,4.569620253164557
1893474,4,B00009W2GQ,"After the cliffhanger ending of the ""Matrix Reloaded"", this third and final entry in the Wachowski Brothers' movie trilogy is a fantastic but controversial closer to this stunning movie series. The machines under control of the renegade program Agent Smith are fast approaching the underground city of Zion where the last remains of humanity takes its last stand against them, while Agent Smith is gaining more power by the minute. Neo is now the only one who can be able to defeat Smith for good. However, he is trapped somewhere outside the regular world and the Matrix on a mysterious train station and a very unpleasant individual called the Trainman who controls the train station can free him from there. After much hell, they manage to free Neo from the train station and now Neo must fight and defeat Agent Smith once and for all as he is the only one who can truly save humanity from total extinction. This might sound a little too close to being similar in plot to ""The Terminator"" but this isn't time-traveling like from those movies.
The special effects on this movie are amazing but at times can really go over the top. I especially love the scenery and the way the ship moves through the various tunnels. I've also felt that this movie is much darker than the last two Matrix movies and at times, it even reminds me of the creepiness of ""Event Horizon"" from a few years back. The massive battle scenes are just awesome and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole time they occur.
I know Neo is one of the center characters and Keanu Reeves does such an excellent job at bringing Neo to life but from my opinion, it's Hugo Weaving who really steals the spotlight. Weaving does such a fantastic job at playing the numerous replicates of Agent Smith that he easily tosses just about everyone else on the cast into orbit around the earth. I must say, outside of playing Elrond, I will forever remember Hugo Weaving here as he can really play some frightening bad guys and this movie proves just that. Weaving is scary as the dangerous program Agent Smith. The rest of the actors/ actresses except for Bellucci (Persephone) and the guy, who played Merovingian, do pretty well.
As awesome as this is, there are quite a few gripes I have with this movie. First, with such a wide variety of different realities and high number of questions that the previous two left us wondering, ""Revolutions"" only seemed to answer a few of them yet also created a whole new trainload of new questions that are never answered. The ending even if this is the final trilogy, doesn't seem to quite give a sense of the danger now gone for good but I guess these things were the purpose. On the other hand, I can see why they didn't have so everything is answered as it would be just about impossible to have answers handed over in real life. I can also understand why it is confusing as this movie was designed to make one figure out what was going on and how fate is almost impossible to escape. Very disappointed.
 I felt gravely disappointed with Merovingian and Persephone. We saw Persephone help Morpheus Neo and Trinity and kill one of Merovingian's henchmen but here, she was just totally dumbed-down to just a deaf mute character on here and the couple only appear for about may a few minutes altogether. I expected a lot more out of these two, whether Persephone would battle her husband or betray Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus. I felt hugely disappointed with these two and felt that this movie could have done without them. I especially hated the way she looked on this movie. The repulsive outfit that she wore looked so tight that those busts looked like they would have their blood circulation cut off. Yergh! Bellucci was good in the ""Reloaded"" movie but here, she has brought along some of the emptiest acting that I've seen in many years.
The main flaw in this movie is that with such a HUGE dimensions that this movie tackles, just the two hour and fifteen minute length only covers the tip of the iceberg. I think that this movie would've been so much better had it been extended for at least another half hour or even up to over three hours long. Perhaps the movie studios are planning on releasing Platinum Extended Editions with new footage incorporated into the movies the way they did with ""Lord of the Rings"", I don't know but I felt that ""Matrix Revolutions"" length doesn't do it a lot of justice. For what it is, ""Matrix Revolutions"" is awesome, but it could really have been an outstanding epic finale. This is a definite must-own movie whenever it comes out on DVD but I feel that this had a lot of room for improvement and that they blew their chance at it. Then again maybe they are planning on releasing an extended edition of this movie in the foreseeable future to make up for the flaws on here. I can understand how many were disappointed with this movie but even then, this doesn't deserve the high number of negative reviews.
It's still a very good movie and the tons and tons of awesome action, battle scenes along with the tons of fun in this film make up for the missteps on here but the missteps are bigger than those in ""Reloaded"". They created a fantastic trilogy that well definitely be sci-fi classics in the years to come. Go and see this movie today. Just don't expect anything near perfection and if you can get by some of the major flaws, this is just an awesome movie. I can't wait to have all three of these movies once they are all on DVD.",1070150400,2,5488,4.532258064516129
1893475,3,B00009W2GQ,"One thing that sticks out from ""Reloaded"" is the Oracle telling Neo ""You have to make up your own mind"". That's really how I feel about ""Matrix Revolutions"". I really was disappointed with Matrix Revolutions, but that doesn't make it bad. It's just one of those things where you can't count on professional reviews, nor can you rely on our reviews. It's the type of movie you'll either love or hate, and it's up to you, the person reading this, to decide for yourself.
Everybody who likes this movie has their own reasons for liking it, and everyone who hates it has their reasons too; most are good reasons. Speaking for myself, I bet that I will like this movie a lot more on DVD. That was the way it was for Reloaded. I was disappointed in the theater, but quite satisfied by it at home and had much more fun with it. Don't ask why.
As for Revolutions, for me, it provided no real answers to the questions that Reloaded created. Call me silly, but at the end of Reloaded I thought that they were actually in a matrix within a matrix. They weren't really ""free"", they were plugged into a `special' matrix for people who begin to resist the `real' matrix, so they think they are fighting this war, only it's just another matrix, and the machines are going to wipe out Zion, basically emptying their recycle bin and start over, and they've done it five times already. That was the impression that ""The Architect"" gave me in Reloaded, and after Smith hopped into a human body, and Neo is using the force to stop sentinels it wasn't a far stretch to assume they were all still ""plugged in"" even though they thought they weren't. Where Neo's power comes from is a total mystery to me now.
A lot of the people who are confused by this finally, have been slammed by Pro-Revolutions reviewers here for being closed-minded. For me, confused is more the word to use, and good movies aren't supposed to confuse people. I mean if you want to provoke thought, that's one thing. But the only thought Revolutions provoked in me was how long and confusing the whole thing was.
There are computer dorks here too who simply think anyone who didn't ""get it"" was stupid. But that's the internet for you, isn't it? Then there are those who remind us that Reloaded and Revolutions are both the final chapter, and we're supposed to factor that in, and put the two movies together in our minds, and THEN it will make more sense. I watched Reloaded at home, about a30 minutes before leaving to see Revolutions, and it was no help at all.
I would like to see Revolutions again, so maybe I'll get what all the 5-star reviewers here got that I didn't. I tried so hard to like it; except the movie is so slow (The big battle was so big and long that after a time even that got boring). I don't think I can sit through it in a theater again, so I'll wait for the DVD, and remain optimistic that this will be a better movie for me at home than in the theaters. I bet that may be the case for a lot of us.
This review is probably no help to anyone. I really, really love the matrix concept. I think the first matrix was as far as they should have gone. THAT was thought provoking. ""Revolutions"" was fun. The effects were the best I've seen, but it's mired down by this convoluted plot that I can't figure out. Once again this does not make Matrix Revolutions a bad movie or unworthy of your time. That is for you, and you alone to decide for yourself.",1070150400,4,3421,4.363636363636363
1893476,2,B00009W2GQ,"You cannot expect too much after the disastrous Reloaded.  Hell, I'd go further to say that the entire franchise has entered the irrecoverable zone.  In truth, the Matrix series will not be remembered as one of those great trilogies.  Ahem, recent attempts in Star Wars!  It's a quite a shame too, since the first film was such a fiery triumph.  I thought it served as a harbinger of what future movie-making was going to be - bold magic.  However, after the release of Reloaded everything went tomblike and cold.  Now the mere reason to see Revolutions is for the absolute closure towards Neo once and for all.  And believe me that's the best thing that could ever happen.
First off the beginning is a big yawn-inducing way to takeoff.  It's practically pointless, really.  I'm perplexed and bewildered as how  the Wachowski brothers could possibly come up with this.  They managed to grip us in the first one and at least Reloaded threw in an interesting catalyst.  Here, we have Neo stuck in a limbo between the Matrix and reality.  It takes place in a deserted train station, governed by the rules of the TRAIN MAN!  It becomes obvious that Neo is stuck within the TRAINMAN'S world when the bum smashes Neo into a wall.  Morpheus, Trinity, and the Oracle's bodyguard spring into prompt action to persuade the FRENCHMAN! to free Neo.  They quickly succeed and we thankfully never see the TRAIN MAIN AND FRENCHMAN again!  Which brings up the question, why were we introduced to them in the first place?  I can't comprehend why, but maybe its because I can't pen up anything as *snicker* good *snicker* as this?
Once a captivating plot turns into a mishmash of using the One concept to thwart the nasty baddies.  Like when Neo and Trinity were cruising on their hovercraft and met a fleet of octopi sentinels.  Since we already knew that Neo has the power to destroy them with a wave of a hand (Reloaded), a number of scenes become dryly predictable.  I recall when the Wachowski brothers received an MTV award for the first Matrix film.  They said if we liked the first one then we're going to love the second one.  I`m smirking right now and  I`ll just leave it at that.
Dialogue and characters are a movie's backbone.  Mishandle the two and your on a crash collision into a fiasco.  Revolutions falls face-first and hard.  The dialogue lacks appeal and substance.  I was sorely reminded of Episode II and realized both movies have so much in common.  I'm thinking Lucas and the Wachowskis must've gotten together during the development.  It has to be the reason, it just has to be!  Since the dialogue feels so wooly and pokerfaced whereas the first film  had a charismatic Oracle.  Not to mention Agent Smith's chilly viewpoint in how the human race is a virus and the machines are the cure.
We don't even sense that the humans are fighting against total extinction.  Why?  Because we don't give a damn what happens to the cast.  All I notice is the dire need to generate excessive amounts of battles that aren't even worth bragging about.  It's a bad thing when the audience, like myself, begin to want to see the destruction of  Zion and have the bad guys triumph.  There are a number of characters onscreen  and like the TRAIN MAN, I question their appearances.  I thought of a sarcastic whoopee when Niobe showcased her talent to maneuver the ship in ""impossible"" ways.  Then I laughed at the dialogue of a captain verbalizing how astounded he was.  This has to be a spoof of how Sci-Fi movies aren't supposed to done.  It just has to be!  Which leads me to the question when is the REAL Matrix follow-ups coming?  Face it, if you compared Reloaded and Revolutions to the first one, you'll practically substantiate their apparent discrepancies.
Last thing I'll discuss are the major fight scenes.  Are we, the audience, really in need to see visual splendor?  Because that's all I'm sensing from the Matrix and Star Wars.  Style unseating substance.  End this nonsensical trend.  Graphically driving the movie does not spell out memorable scenes.  The standoff against sentinels and human mechs definitely looks more wacky than anything.  Suspense was at a low point during the otherwise climatic fight.  It feels out of place and dull.  Its hard to believe that millions of dollars were blown on the very mediocre battles.  And where did the martial arts run off to?  The excess of clanking robots blasting endless streams of firepower on the sentinels felt like a distraught imagination.  Since the machines drilled a hole to Zion why didn't they lob their explosives like they did in Reloaded?  As for the one-on-one clash with Neo and Smith, it superfluously mirrors something out of the cartoon Dragon Ball Z.  I scoff at this and scoff it some more!
Sci-Fi has never felt ridiculously fictitious or futile.  Thanks a lot Revolutions.  I'm a fantasy junkie and you now make me seem like one of those fanboys who root for the impassive Neo and the clich&eacute; of style over substance.  Yet, hope enkindles!  There will be an emotional intimacy that will be in the next Lord of The Rings film!

I was greatly looking foward and anticipating to the 3rd and final peice in the matrix trilogy, and I can honestly say I didn't walk out disappointed or unforfilled. I went back and saw the film for the 2nd time in the theaters, it was just as enjoyable.
During the entire film all I had in my mind was that final fight between Agent Smith and Neo. It was great, the usal expectancy would be that Neo would win because he is the ""good guy"" but the ending was amazing. Agent Smith was a big bad ass! He also got the same powers as Neo, so he could fly in the final fight. I pitty anyone who had the ending blown for them before seeing the movie. Thats why I went on the 2nd day of its release. The only thing I had blown for me was that Agent Smith could fly in the 3rd installment, I wasn't pissed off at the time but intriged, still I would have liked it better if it was a suprise.
 yeah, I cant wait for its DVD release, I want to add it to my collection of The matrix, The matrix reloaded, The matrix revisited and The animatrix.

1893479,5,B00009W2GQ,"I have thoroughly enjoyed all 3 of these films.  I have found them to be intriguing, original and just well done.  Obviously, no one could ever recreate and capture the mind-blowing originality of the first film.  However, this was a very well conceived story.  Just to show you how we can become so accustomed to the typical storyline I honestly went into this film with the expectations for a conclusion that was in no way even close to how the series finally ended.  Looking back on it; I realize that the series ended the only way it could end.  It ended the way all stories about ""messiahs"" and ""saviors"" must end.  Unlike some of the other reviewers here I will not give away specifics, although, if you have even the slightest literary background you will have guessed at what happens.
The film is a feast for the fans of martial arts, CGI graphics epic battles and contests between good and evil, (superheroes), fought between titans possessing almost godlike powers.  It would be best to not make the mistake of assuming that Smith has anything to do with the goals of the machine society any longer.  You will not leave this film having had every question in your mind answered.  You will have closure to a great story worthy of the playwrites of ancient Greece and some great conversations with friends and family about what everyone thinks was going on and what perhaps will happen.  The last scene with Neo in it I believed was representative of Mallory's La Morte D'Arthur, (King Arthur).  Contrary to what some have wrote here I found this to be a well done, well told series and each film left me wanting more.  If I have any criticism at all it is the same as most; I have never been overly impressed with Mr. Reeves range as a dramatic actor.  While I have come to accept him as the ""one"" in these films I will always wonder whether someone else might not have been a better choice.
While I am interested in philosophy, unlike some, I have never attached more meaning to these films other than being smart well crafted entertainment.  However, with that said I did truly appreciate the idea that more often than not it is harder to do what is right.  It is more difficult, and sometimes even painful to make the right choices.  Perhaps that is part of the reason why these films have resonated with the public so well; like the message from God you have ""choices"" and that is what makes life interesting, a challenge and very often difficult and painful.

1893501,3,B00009W2GQ,"First off, it is impossible to review this film on it's own, as it is basically a straight continuation of the second film in the series. Second, everything you have heard about the action and effects is understated - the sequences are absolutely brilliant. There, got that over with. Now, there must be a story in here somewhere... OH! got it. Yah. The series is a simplified parable about the various prisons-of-being humans and their progeny end up in. Kudos for making the machines behave as they are supposed to - like advanced machines, not people. The Keymaker and the Architect in particular say some of the dopeyest sounding things, yet taken as coming from an artificial intelligence, suddenly there is an undercurrent flowing through that helps explain exactly why the ""war"" between the humans and machines continues. OK, this could be the ""Arnold"" excuse for sometimes sub-par acting and poor dialog, but in these films, it isn't. Kudos also for pulling no punches - when telling the story of a savior, well, losses must be taken along the way. The heavier the loss, the greater the dramatic payoff of the resolution. Kudos as well for keeping the nature of what happens completely ambiguous - none of the pontificating poker-faced icons in this film end up being right per se, but they do manage to mature over the arc of the films into actual people. Morpheus, the Oracle,the Architect - none of them have any more clue than the others, and are all slaves to their own contructions/beliefs. Only the One, whose mind is free (and not too sharp, it must be said) is flexible enough to see around all the bumpers in the path to salvation. It was also nice to see Hollywood steal not only the ""wire-fu"" effects but some plot complexity from Japanese and Korean film. Kudos Maximus for the Bollywood-dance-number climactic battle for Zion. And for those who bash this film, I can't possibly imagine what they could have done differently to properly wrap up the story. If the ending battles - and the last half of this film is almost wall-to-wall fast action - aren't enough, and the sacrifices made to try and save humanity aren't enough and the ""leave them thinking about how what happened did in fact happen"" didn't faze you, well, you better write your own blockbuster. If you can beat this, you'll probably get a movie deal. Keanu Reeves awful acting, or lack thereof, knocks a star off this film. Otherwise, I can't think of a thing I'd change. I would love a sequel, but to do one would be artistically unpardonable. That is the strength of a created world - we want to see more stories in it, even if there are no more to be told.

1893502,3,B00009W2GQ,"I thought the movie was brilliant, but each film has fallen to
progressively less and less in terms of overall impact since the original...
This in my opinion is due to the Wachowski brothers not having any more original sources to draw on -they know what I mean by that statement..(Can we say NT?)
In any case, I missed the enigmatic presence of Gloria Foster as the Oracle. She was one of my favorite aspects of the first two movies,and while her substitute did well,she paled in comparison with the original much like the two sequels did in comparison to the original Matrix movie..

It seems as if the Wachowski brothers have increasingly depended
on special effects in lieu of philosphical epiphany,and this ""final"" movie personifies this to a tee..
Not to take anything away from the special effects,as they are no doubt the best in the biz at this time. No doubt the Matrix series will be watched again and again by new generations,just as we currently watch the Wizard of Oz like our grandparents did..
But..I just left the theater feeling empty ,like the story was unresolved somehow..I don't know if this was due to my not wanting the trilogy to end as much as it was my sense that the scene was being set for yet another sequel..

Special Effects-Incredible. Better than the first two. The Zion war is really cool, as is the Super Brawl between Agent Smith and Neo. Awesome. 10/10
Acting-The same as the first two, cheesy and sometimes confusing, but less of the latter. It's still good though, for what's there. 8/10
Sound-These movies introduced some interesting sound effects never before heard. This movie continues the tradition. 10/10
Story-A lot of people said this entry in the trilogy lacked a good story. I felt that it was a better plot than Reloaded, meaning nothing has been dumbed down. The story is great, but I have a complaint. The ending was so unbelievably infuriating, i almost stood up and yelled so many profanities. You may too. But when you get mad, remember this: the story isn't over. Next year, a massive online multiplayer game is coming out, continuing the story of the humans and their struggle with the machines.

The series should not have begun with such heavy intellectual and philosophical tones if they were to be given last seat and only continued in a half-assed manner throughout the subsequent films.  Though many may have just wanted the entertaimnent derived from the visual effects or action sequences, with which I don't argue, the films have no maintained integrity beyond this point.
Matrix Revolutions has a miserable script, sloppier effects than its predecessors, and many cut-off and unfinished story lines.  And since it has become more action-oriented, the sub-par acting is not unexpected, but still proves annoying.  Furthermore, because it did not live up to what is expected of ""the final installment"", it became an even grander failure.

Well, Neo (Keanu Reeves)finds out about it. that is the start of the ""final"" film of the Wachowski Brothers mind-blowing science fiction trilogy.
What follows the start is a fantastic gravity defying battle between the Marivingions thugs and Morphius, Trinity and Seraph, a veryconfusing chat with the Oricle, and a attack on zion scene that beats everything from the sequel (even THAT car chase).
It can be safely said that the first hour and a half is the most fun I've had in the cinema since ""Pirates of the Caribean"" or ""the Two Towers"". It certainly beats Reloaded.
So with a heavy heart I will explain why it lost a star. The end fight between Smith and Neo was the biggest anti-climax in cinema history, and the end was so unbelievable it made the end of Reloaded look like a genuis' work.
I would put money on the end being changed by Warner for the possibility of another sequel. The Wachowski COULD not have wrote this end.

1893507,4,B00009W2GQ,"Okay, i am a die hard Matrix fan so some of you may not agree with my views. Although i think most of the trilogy is explained in the first movie, i disagree that it is the best. Reloaded had excellent fight scenes and an awesome car chase. Revolutions is such an awesome ending. It did not let me down, as i was shaking in my seat. The ending to me was a bit of a surprise, and as Reloaded, it ended in sort of a cliffhanger. I say, go see it, it is worth it. I would have payed $20.",1069459200,2,484,3.801980198019802
1893508,2,B00009W2GQ,"well, that certainly wasn't as good as expected. Revolutions is in effect just one long action sequence. Just as Reloaded had a lot of mumbo-jumbo packed in between with action, Revolutions has a whole lot of action with just a few scenes of mumbo-jumbo. The mumbo-jumbo lines fall predictably to enigmas like the oracle, Agent Smith, Morpheus and the Frenchman.
In Revolutions, the Sentinel army that was digging to Zion in Reloaded, reaches the human city and there follows a heroic battle. Neo and Trinity have other fish to fry and do not get much air time due to the metal flying in Zion.
Revolutions fails as an ending because there is no decline from tension. I don't want to spoil any secrets, but the good are not shown to be rewarded, the evil is not eliminated, in fact it is not clear what will happen to the Matrix and Zion. It is as if the directors went ""Oops, its two hours long already, just cut it off, wherever it is."" The Oracle's actions are never fully explained, or why Agent Smith has corrupted even beyond the control of the Architect. It's difficult for me to elaborate without letting some cats out of the bag. To put it succintly, the Wachowski brothers seem to be leaving the way clear for a fourth movie.
On the positive side however, you can depend on Revolutions for what has already been effectively delivered in the first two movies: plenty of CGI action that keeps up the pace and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The battle is fantastic and the Sentinel invasion truly conveys fear and awe. Apart from the APCs moving like metallized gorillas, the human defence is breathtaking. The much acclaimed showdown between Neo and Smith too is very well brought out. Thankfully, the directors do not repeat what they did in Reloaded and break into bullet-time continously and seemingly just for the heck of it. Instead, the slower shots are well-timed and exciting.
So the overall verdict is that Revolutions is good as a movie by itself but fails as the ending to a trilogy.",1069372800,4,2006,4.621848739495798
1893519,5,B00009W2GQ,"This movie was EXCELLENT.  They have the gutts to do what other movie makers have not done before.  The story is about a cause, not necessarily about the people, but yet they introduce us to so many great characters that believe in this cause.  Because it is about the idea, it is a truly great film and they can go where other films have not.  Someone once said, ""Small people talk about other people, average people talk about events, great people talk about ideas.""  I think that applies to this film.  They still do a great job with the characters, but this time it's actually about something worth thinking about.
The story ends more beautifully than I could have hoped for... I love the way they ended it, though I hate to see this trilogy over.  It's one of my favorites forever more now, even perhaps outdoing my love for the Indiana Jones trio because it has no ugly middle movie- it's a perfect trio.",1069372800,3,910,4.4787878787878785

From the first Matrix I beleived we actually had an intense Sci Fi story on our hands, which we did to a point. Once Neo goes into the Matrix and learns all of the tricks of the world, it quickly shifts towards an action movie. Not that I minded the change but I thought that at some point throughout the second or third movie we would have some more science fiction. Though there were small parts of it in reloaded, the ending where you learn about the past of the matrix, they failed to make an impression with it. It seemed like throughout the second and third movie they were trying to confuse people so much that they put themselves in a corner when it came to the ending. It drops off at a point and leaves you wondering if maybe its would have been worth it to make a fourth one and actually show a good ending. One of the major disappointments is the lack of creativity when it came to action points. The fight in the lobby with seraph to free neo is a rehash of the first movie, only this time people can use antigravity. This goes against what was explain in the first movie, ""rules of gravity can be bent but not broken"", and the attack on the dock was almost the same images over and over. I wish that a true sci fi series could be made and i thought we had one with the matrix but by the end all we are concern about is mathmatical equations.",1069200000,,1517,4.198630136986301

Matrix set up an ongoing phantasy that would only have been sustained by an equally good story line photography and inventive action. Not so, Matrix Revolution capitalizes on action scenes already proved in Matrix and the story line comes too close to the Dune Machine Crusade and neither resolves nor enlightens the conflict. I expected much more and had faith in the film makers here, who are not the Hollywood standard, but still fell victim to their earlier success.
The actor's emphasis on performing their own stunts did not improve the story, neither did the change in characters, i.e. the oracle and crew.

1893525,1,B00009W2GQ,"I am dumbfounded at how many people actually gave this film five stars. Imagine if Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Lea where all given bit part roles to play in the final movie of the trilogy and Jabba the Hut, a Jawa, a Storm Trooper and an Ewok where made the central focus characters? Would you like that? Well this is EXACTLY what Revolutions does!
Okay so Terminator 3 was no Terminator 1 or 2, but it was satisfactory! Return of the Jedi was the weakest of the series but that too was satisfactory. Star Wars Ep. 1 was nothing like the originals but again at least it was satisfactory.
Revolutions is nothing like the above. It is more akin to the kind of sabotage that we see in movie remakes!
The filmmakers obviously have absolutely no idea what made the first film so good. Reloaded and Revolutions have gone down the road of Disney cartoons instead of staying on the patch of action comic book type appeal. It was a tremendously bad call by the filmmakers to focus too much on Zion and bring bit-part characters to the forefront of the movie. Morpheus is forgotten about and does little more than sit in a co-pilot seat next to Niobe throughout the movie. It was Morpheus who made the metaphysical statements cool. When the same things are spoken by some bit part characters... (who are given a leading roles!... oh what a crisis!... you simply DO NOT DO THAT.)... it just sounds plain stupid and dumb. NEW CHARACTERS are introduced that serve very little function and are forgotten about just as quick. The Trainman appears as an important character and then... disappears. His whole scene at the start of the movie with Neo served absolutely NO PURPOSE. The Architect materializes briefly at the end for a few lines to try and consolidate everything. Persephone is back again with the Merovingian as if nothing is wrong after her releasing the Keymaker in Reloaded. The Twins who disappeared in Reloaded are obviously vaporized, because they are not here.
The original Matrix was a high like no other. Reloaded was satisfactory and at least had some knockout action sequences with elements that where in the first Matrix and a few extra scenes here and there to help develop the story around Zion. Okay so the dance scene at the start was totally out of place but in Reloaded as soon as Neo met the Oracle it was the Matrix rocking like you mother from start to finish. Revolutions is NOTHING like Reloaded and it certainly is at the opposite end of the spectrum when compared to the original Matrix.
Questions that where created in Reloaded are left unanswered. What is it with the Indian family who take up almost fifteen minutes talking at the start of the film? The copout for replacing the Oracle with a new actress is explained in the worst possible way..... AND WHOEVER WROTE THE SCREENPLAY DIALOGUE SHOULD HAVE HIS PAYCHECK REVOKED! What a cliche driven script! You will not believe the stereotype dialogue on display here! Seriously it is a SIN to do what they have done to the Matrix series. Watch the climatic scene between Neo and Trinity which lasts for ages. Listen to what they are saying! Watch Neo stand for a few minutes in stupidity as Bane, who sounds, talks and moves just like Agent Smith, almost has to tell Neo who he is before the penny drops with our savior character! Bill and Ted where on the screen for a few moments there. Sssshesshhh.....
The filmmakers have stamped all over this film as if they are out to harm the entire series - or maybe - is it just possible ..... that the first Matrix movie was just made a FANTASTIC MOVIE by accident? Everything on display in Revolutions seems to point to that conclusion.
There are only two key action sequences in this film. One which revolves around warriors controlling ""Aliens"" type robots with guns and the machines crashing around the place with lots of gun-fire and explosions. It is excellent stuff for the first few minutes but far too much time is spent on it. We WANT to see NEO getting it on with Agent Smith!... and finally ... (and it is a long time coming) when it appears, it is nothing compared to the Alleyway Brawl we saw in Reloaded.
This film is a disaster. Even if it where like Reloaded it would have been an acceptable movie but it seems almost like some sort of Direct to Video type movie. The filmmakers should never have given our principle characters a back seat to other bit part actors. They should have reduced the Zion fight sequence by at least three-quarters of the running time and put that space into Neo and Smith getting it on in some way shape or form. The screenplay should have been revised from the start instead of plowing so much money into the Zion action sequence. It is very hard to describe what an utter disappointment this film was. It could possibly be one of worst mega-budget pictures ever made. Fans will feel downright conned. Those who are looking for popcorn fodder will probably find it okay-ish entertainment but if we wanted to watch okay-ish entertainment we would hope to find that somewhere else other than in one of the most expensive sci-fi films ever made. Thank God that the Lord of the Rings is there to redeem our faith in high-concept large budget fantasy films. Revolutions is a prime example of a marketing confidence trick marred with bad acting, bad writing and bad direction. The special effects are on top form but this DOES NOT MAKE A MOVIE.
Revolutions is a bad stain on the Matrix series - if not trilogies as a whole. Fans should voice their disapproval so that this sort of humiliation does not happen again.",1069113600,99,5595,4.61283851554664

I just knew that Han Solo would shut down the shields and I knew the Death Star was history. I never really worried about the characters the way I worried about the ""Revolutions"" heroes. They were written very well and they were all very human and vulnerable and they made you really admire their heroism during the battle for Zion.

There I stated that although many have been disappointed by the movie, I do not share those feelings.  I enjoyed the action and found it to be a descent, though admittedly flawed, conclusion to a great science fiction trilogy.  Here I review the IMAX presentation of the movie.  The first time I saw the film it was in the Mann's Grauman's Chinese theatre in Hollywood.  That theatre has state-of-the-art sound and video that was a perfect compliment to a movie like Revolutions.  When I decided to see the movie again, I thought only an IMAX presentation could top my previous experience.  For those not familiar, IMAX theaters boast a 7 story high screen and a 12,000 Watt sound system.  They normally screen movies filmed specifically for IMAX theatres.  They have however shown the last two Matrix films on IMAX screens.  It is an experience not to be missed.  If you saw Reloaded on IMAX, you have a pretty good idea what to expect.  The clarity of the picture and richness of the sound is amazing.  I did notice one difference though.  When I saw Reloaded, I recall the film had been formatted to fit on the gigantic IMAX screen.  In other words, it filled the entire area of the screen.  I assume (but am not positive) that the picture's aspect ratio had to be changed to do so.  For Revolutions however, the movie was letter boxed, so it retained is original aspect ratio.  I personally think this is a better way to present the film.  Seeing a movie on the IMAX screen is generally a little more expensive than your standard theatre, but it is worth the experience, especially if you are like me and love the big screen experience.",1069027200,,1755,4.5673076923076925

Maybe, but that doesn't detract from the plain and simple fact that I had a great time watching this movie and the entire trilogy.  They are movies, entertainment, and are not meant to give the meaning of life or be some quasi-religion, so some of you people really need to lighten up a bit.
Revolutions had its flaws, but overall was well worth the visit to see it on the big screen and will it be a DVD I purchase to round out my collection.  I went to see it in the theater knowing full well that it wasn't going to answer all the question raised in the previous movies, but you know what, that didn't matter.  There was a story here, and a good one.  One that kept me engrossed for the length of the film, expanded on the characters, and dazzled the eyes.  Sure, some of the parts of the film could have been streamlined or made a bit clearer, and the big finalie could have been even bigger (though believe me, it is big enough), but on the whole, Revolutions brought the trilogy to a satisfying and entertaining end.  It is an action flick, not a drama, so don't expect that level of depth when that is not what the film(s) set out to do.  As for the unanswered questions, I for one like going out for coffee afterwards and getting everyone elses take on things, and seeing what they think happened.  (ie.:  When agents took over a person, did that person die?)
This was a slick, cool, adrenaline packed series of movies, worth being taken as a whole, though the 1st will always be my favorite.
The Matrix - 5 stars, a real thinker with effects that were never before seen on the big screen.
Reloaded - 3.5 stars.  A good movie with even better special effects but relied a bit too much on the action and philosophical mumbo jumbo.  Really just an intro to ...
Revolutions - 4 solid stars.  There were some cliches and the Zion battle was just  a bit too intense for a bit too long, but those are minor things.  The special effects shine like never before (loved those rain effects at the end),  the characters were more real and developed,  and I left the theater feeling like I got my money's worth and pondering everything I had just experienced for the next few hours.
In the end, I think that is what really counts.  Thank you Wachowski brothers for giving us a good trilogy, not an easy thing to do.",1069027200,11,2392,4.346846846846847
1893543,2,B00009W2GQ,"This review contains spoilers... However, if they prevent you from watching the film, consider that a good thing. You'd be better off if I just told you how it ended and saved you two hours of your life.
A horrible sense of disillusion dawned on me as I watched this third installment in the oversized Matrix trilogy. Suddenly I realized how trite and unoriginal the pseudo-philosophical concepts that guided the story were. These are the same concepts that the first two movies in the series followed, but this time it's much more obvious than ever before. The first film in the series, while not as original in conception as it seemed to me back then, had sparks of uniqueness and originality like few other movies - perhaps not in its concept but certainly in its writing, styling, and cinematography. The second one, while it didn't have that same spark, still managed to be satisfactory by incorporating several action scenes of immense originality and uniqueness in their styling and visualization. This third film doesn't even have that. I won't go against sequels and trilogies in general, because classics like Star Wars and The Godfather, not to mention more modern examples like Lord of the Rings and Kill Bill, could have never reached their full depth in only one film, but a filmmaker shouldn't have to do three films when he said all he had to say in the first one.
First, we have an impressive but rather pointless fight sequence in the Merovingian's bar. It might have been fitting for an opener if the rest of the film was more impressive. The mythological and theological hints in that scene are so obvious and overwhelming (the club is hell, the Merovingian is Hades, the Trainman is the Ferryman), yet they lead nowhere. Much more coherent were the creepy sadism-masochism not-so-subtle hints; but whether that was meant to have some meaning, or just to satisfy Larry Wachowski's odd passions, I don't know. The character of Seraph - `The Wingless Angel' - seems to be building towards something, but reaches no conclusion. This is one of many openings the trilogy leaves that make me fear a spin-off, an animated series or perhaps awful second-rate books written by fanboys like the ones Star Trek got. The scene in the train station is probably the best part of the movie, and I liked the low-key, minimal production feel of it. It got dwarfed, however, next to the laughs I got from the scene in which Trinity and Morpheus meet the Oracle - Mary Alice. The Wachowskis were at a loss as to how deal with the death of actress Gloria Foster, and did less than well in the ridiculous solution they came up with. I think I would have liked it better if the Oracle became a thin, young, blonde woman; that would at least show some guts.
The battle for Zion was of course impressive, but to me it seemed like little more than a big screen computer game. The whole thing was badly unconvincing, especially those MACH style Starship Troopers rip-off robots the rebels use. And since the directors created in me absolutely zero emotional connection to either Zion or any of the people in it (were we supposed to become emotionally attached to Zion after that horrible orgy/rave scene in the second movie? If so, badly done) I simply didn't care about the outcome. An important part of good sci-fi writing is, since the viewer obviously has no empathy for the characters or places beforehand, to make him care about them. Matrix Revolutions didn't do that. Zee, Link, Lock and all of these half-baked characters introduced to us in the second film are uninteresting and unimportant. That entire battle was too long and very dull.
As for the other big showdown - the battle between Neo and Smith... Neo already battled with Smith in the first and second movie, and both of these scenes were original and impressive. The duel in the first movie was wonderfully directed and choreographed, while the battle between Neo and the multiple Smiths in The Matrix Reloaded was original and exciting. This final battle is none of the above; it's dull, predictable and unimpressive, using every clich imaginable. It consists mainly of Smith knocking Neo down and Neo getting up again, over and over. And let's not even discuss Trinity's horrible, oversized, melodramatic and pathetic death scene which would have made Wagner blush.
Another thing I realized watching this movie is that the only character in the entire trilogy that I really cared for, that really had a personality and characterization, was Agent Smith. Hugo Weaving is, I now realize, a fantastic actor, and he created a truly timeless and unique character. I also loved his real-world incarnation as Bane; I could see it was Smith long before he gave himself away with that `Mr. Anderson' remark. Could you possibly have recognized Neo or Trinity had they stumbled into another body? Smith is the only major creation which made the expansion of the series somewhat worthwhile. Morpheus was an interesting character in the first movie, but I could never forgive him after that horrible, hilarious speech he gave in Zion in the beginning of part 2. As for Neo, he was never very interesting since he became the One - I liked him better when he was a confused, clueless hacker.

Moreover, I am not an action junkie, though I have to say, Revolutions was over my expectations. It impressed me a lot and in the end I realised the 2 hours passed so fast.
It is a good movie in terms of action and special effects. Also, it does not lack interesting ideas - one needs to have some brain in order to figure out some clues.  So, if you are looking for  ideas, believe me, they are there - you just have to look for them.
If you are looking for action, it is there. It is also a real revolution in what special effects and computer technology can do today. And I would give an Oscar for the special effects!
I also enjoyed the ending, whici is ""open"", in the sense that  it could genetrate a lot of questions and answers. Or maybe a fourth Matrix.
I am a bit dissapointed about the negative reviews this movie got, as I don't think it is like the other action films Hollywood produced so far. It is smart, well done, with action and emotions.

If you go to see it for a plot or good acting, then prepare to blub into your popcorn. The plot is weak, meandering and falls into the pit of repeating cliche. The fight scenes are way too long, and the most tedious I have ever seen - there is no suspense or climactic development to the plot. Acting is at best workaday, and at times the worst kind of hamming. Hugo Weaving's laugh towards the end comes straight out of the pantomine top-drawer.
If you go to see it for a conclusion to the series - don't bother. Some of the reviews seem to suggest that it leaves you thinking - the only thinking I was doing as I came out of the cinema was 'why have I wasted 8 and 2.5 hours of my life on this...' There are more holes in the plot than in swiss cheese - but the point is you can't be bothered with working out why - you are not drawn into the characters  or situations.

Yes, many did expect it to be mediocore.  Luckily, I decided that these people shouldn't decide my opinion for me, and I saw the movie as soon as I could.  It is a MUST SEE.  The effects are revolutionary, the acting is incredible, and the story is captivating.  I would reccomend this movie to any serious movie-goer who likes a good picture that makes you think.  I did feel the ending was sufficent, and definately made the audience think.

1893565,4,B00009W2GQ,"""The Matrix Revolutions"" continues the story begun in the original ""Matrix"" film.  Once again Keanu Reeves plays cybermessiah Neo, who fights to defend humanity against an enslaving machine collective.
""Revolutions"" effectively expands upon the compelling mythology established in the original film, as the freedom fighters continue to move between the gritty real world and a complex virtual reality construct.  Much of the film is a relentless orgy of violence and explosions--at times it's just too much and becomes exhausting.  Nevertheless, there are a number of genuinely thrilling and inventive action/fight scenes.  There are also some memorable visual images.
At its worst ""Revolutions"" can be bombastic, obscure, pretentious, and even corny.  The film is at its best when it remains in touch with the essential humanity of its characters.  Reeves anchors the eclectic, multiethnic ensemble cast with his earnest, understated performance.",1068940800,3,947,5.728571428571429

Matrix Revolutions was a great conclusion to the Matrix trilogy. I takes some brain power to figure out these movies, but after watching them you get what they are trying to tell you through these movies.
This trilogy has been a MOVIES TO SEE. I have been to revolutions twice and I still marvel at it.

at the end, the oracle's counterpart (the old man) says that keeping a promise is a human quality.  is anyone else aware of these concepts?",1068854400,3,458,4.3882352941176475

If you haven't seen it yet, please ignore the critic's reviews as they are trained to see the technical aspects instead of being able to just enjoy a movie. This movie takes the viewer further that you could have imagined possible with the characters, plot, and visual effects. It keeps you glued to your seat and always wanting more. I never thought Neo and Trinity could make your love their characters more, but this movie does that and SO much more!

And I do _not_ mean that you should refrain from looking for anything 'deep' and just enjoy the action and special effects. Oh, the special effects are fantastic, all right. But the 'deep' ideas _are_ there, and you can find them if you know what to look for.
I think the problem is that so many viewers misunderstood the main theme of the first _Matrix_ film, taking it to be a movie about the question 'What is real?' Then they were disappointed when the next two films had little new to say on that question.
But that's not the main theme of this trilogy, or even of the first film. The theme is: 'What is the nature of the relationship between humans and machines?' And the resolution of _that_ question in the third film has every bit as much mind-blowing power as anything in the original _Matrix_.
The question does get answered, and the answer does make sense. All the tension in the plot comes down to whether Neo is really the 'One' and what it means to be the 'One'. Well, what _is_ the One? I won't tell you, but I _will_ tell you to pay very close attention to the relationship between Neo and Smith.
In this final film of the _Matrix_ trilogy, humans and machines achieve the next level in their symbiotic evolution. The Wachowskis have done it right; the critics have it wrong. Don't miss this one.",1068854400,33,1389,4.4296875
1893570,1,B00009W2GQ,"I only rated this one star because zero stars is not an option.
When I saw the first Matrix movie, I was totally impressed with the great special effects, the creative concept and the style and content invested into that work. I would give the original Matrix movie 5 stars readily.
The second movie, Matrix Reloaded, was a let down by comparison but still enjoyable. I would have given it 3 stars. I can accept this because sequels are seldom as good as the original. There were some nice concepts, but the emphasis shifted to a drastic degree toward more action and less cerebral stimulation. Still, some nice philosophical issues were raised that one might expect to be developed further in the 3rd movie.
Then comes this tripe known as Matrix Revolutions. I think they simply spelled Revulsion incorrectly. In this third effort, which I would give zero stars if possible, we are treated to a wonderland of action sequences that are impossible to enjoy with the screen flooded with flashy lights and strobe effects. These wash out or mask the lack of effort invested in CGI or special effects. Where quality is lacking, expect flash and glitter to replace good film making. The philosophical concepts raised in the first two films are abandoned entirely in an orgy of violent fight scenes. (some of which are played out for such long periods of time as to become boring.)
The first film was a treat for the senses and the mind.
The second was less creative and much less concerned about quality of script or plot.
For the third movie, you can relax and leave your brain at home.
Great for those recovering from the disco era, when mirror balls and strobe lights blinded us to the totally tacky and guady leisure suit and polyester shirts that passed for quality at the time!
And if you have a photosensitive neurological disorder, you definately want to skip this flick. The film simply isn't worth a visit to the emergency room or a stint in ICU!",1068854400,5,1950,4.688046647230321
1893571,1,B00009W2GQ,"I actually haven't written a review for Amazon in quite some time, and usually when I do it's because a product was so good or so bad that I feel somewhat compelled to do so.  Such is the case with the recent installment of the ""Matrix"".
First off, I have to say that the Matrix's ""philosophy"" is not really philosophy.  The Matrix just put an interesting spin on Descartes' (among others) philosophy.  I throw this in here because I can't stand people telling me that these movies have such a deep philosophical message, when it's actually just using philosophy as a means for entertainment (not that I'm against this use of philosophy, in fact I rather enjoy it).  Second, I wasn't disappointed with ""Reloaded"", I thought it was fun action flick that made some great promises for ""Revolutions"".  But, with that said...
...Revolutions did not deliver.  Most the questions brought up in ""Reloaded"" were not only unresolved, many of them were never brought up.  You want to know how Neo stopped those sentinels at the end of the last movie?  Well you won't know, because it's not talked about, except in passing by the Oracle.  Moreover, none of the people in the ""real world"" seem phased by the fact that Neo is able to stop these ultra-super killing machines by sticking up his hand and giving the angry face.  Why not put Neo in the middle of Zion and let him do the angry face while all the ultra-super killing machines come in?  Perhaps the humans are worried that Neo will go back into a coma, I don't really know.  Which proves my point, you just don't really know about anything.  We're just supposed to believe this is what happens, which I think is kind of odd for a movie that supposed to make you think.  And the final battle between Neo and Agent Smith was anti-climatic!  What's up with that!  But I will say that the Zion battle was pretty cool, even if it did drag on a bit.
So in closing, this movie really did make me sad.  It really lacked the heart the first two movies had; in fact I got the general feeling that the Wackowski bothers just didn't care about this movie at all.  It's sad to see such potential go down the drain.",1068854400,10,2147,4.4755784061696655
1893572,5,B00009W2GQ,"10 years ago, no one had heard of the Matrix.  No one knew what bullet time meant.  No one knew knew who ""the one"" was, or ever watched Neo Anderson battle agents.
Well, that was 10 years ago, but since the Matrix came out back in the late 90's, it has truly become one of the most watched movies of all time.  A few months ago, we saw Matrix Reloaded.  Another great movie, continueing the story of Earth in a few hundred years.  Finally, Revoltions came out.  Simply put, the best of the 3, an incredible movie, great acting -even Neo this time-, and jaw dropping special affects.  Here's what I thought of the Matrix Revolutions.
1) The Story: *no spoilers* This movie continued the story of the Matrix, the people fighting it, and the lives of free humans fighting for their life.  At this point, Neo is an incredible fighter -both in and out of the Matrix-, and is madly in love with his girlfriend, Trinity.  There is a huge battle about to happen.  Morpheus believes that this is the battle that will end the war.  End the Matrix.  And finally free humanity.  But things are getting dark.  A huge army of Machines is heading toward the last free world, Zion.  Neo is confused and doesn't know what he, the one, is supposed to do.  Betrayals are being made, lives are being lost, and a great power is growing ever stronger in the Matrix.  When suddenly, the Machines are attacking Zion....
2) Special Affects: This movie looked stunning in every single way.  From showing us Zion to some of the big battles.  To seeing first hand the world of the Machines, and the beauty in which all life holds.  Seeing Zion under attack, the battles, all the Machines.  It was incredible.  It really made you feel that these machines were coming...coming for you.  Lord of the Rings like buildings and battles, this movie was just...incredible.  The bullet time action is back as well, and I still am amazed at some of the things the Matrix showed off.  A great movie, and the graphics don't hold back here...
3) Acting: This movie had the best acting of the 3 in my opinion.  Neo finally showed a little emotion in different areas, the love between Neo and Trinity is so strong on film.  Agent Smith, Morpheus, the Oracle, etc...  All play their parts to perfection.  If you liked the first two, or even just thought they were okay, this is a must see.  So much happens in this movie, and the acting, like everything else, is great.  If anything, see this movie to see Neo finally act!
4) Overall- This movie was just...incredible.  6/5 stars, it was perfect in every way.  Anyone not understand Reloaded?  This movie will fill in all the holes.  Wanna know what happends to Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, the Matrix, Agent Smith, Zion, and the world of humans and machines?  You have to see this.  And to see perhaps one of the coolest battles ever -for you action freaks like me-, this is just...awsome.
This is the best of the 3 by far, and if you -like i have said- loved the first two, or even just thought it was decent, The Matrix Revolutions is a movie you CAN NOT MISS!  Head to your nearest theatre and buy that ticket!  This is one of the best movies of the year.  Great movie, great conclusion, Matrix Revolutions simply is AWSOME!
Thx!

1893573,3,B00009W2GQ,"Note: comments also posted on IMDB.com.
The whole NYC crowd laughed throughout the movie.  Every time the noise and action died down enough so that the dialogue had to fend for itself, it proved to be laughably lame and wooden, and everyone in the theater was reminded that there weren't a whole lot of actors on the Matrix payroll.  On that level, Matrix Revolutions was a failure.  I mean, Keanu Reeves is bad enough, but I kept expecting Ben Affleck to walk onto the set and start reeling off gritty, recycled, heroic, military-action-flick one-liners, all without ever losing that silly smirk that he always has on his face.
But I realize that the accomplishment of the Matrix film might lie elsewhere (I mean, besides the visual style, which remained stunning, even in this poor conclusion to the series).  I think what the W brothers have given us is a metaphor empty enough that everyone who sees the movie, from third graders to PhD's, can argue at length about ""what it means.""  All those grad students, IMDBers, bloggers, comic book fiends, and technogeeks out there can state with utter conviction that the Matrix is really all about _______, and they can all be right!  That's the beauty of the trilogy.  It's an incredibly rich and complicated network of signifiers without any definable connection to any set of signifieds.  Another way of saying this is that the Matrix is so filled with ambiguous symbols that it can mean virtually anything, which means that, in the end, it means virtually nothing, in and of itself.
I've heard it myself.  I've listened to two reasonable, intelligent adults argue about specific moments in the film and what they mean in terms of the constructed, mediated nature of reality.  The fact of the matter is (at least I think it's a fact) that the movie can be used to support nearly any ontological position imaginable.  What the W brothers have created here is not a statement so much as a vocabulary.
I guess that could be either positive or negative, depending on one's point of view.  On the negative side, I keep thinking of the Yeats poem, ""Second Coming,"" which foresees the end times, when the ""best lack all conviction.""  Maybe the Matrix trilogy is a true product of our age--an incredibly consuming (time, money, creative effort, careers, etc.) venture that looks great but says nothing.  On the positive side, maybe it's a good thing to give people a philosophical language that is both accessible and flexible, without the complications of history (as is the case with religious vocabularies) or intellectual elitism (as is the case with most academic, theoretical vocabularies).
I'm still trying to figure this out, but I guess the Oracle would tell me that I already know the answer; I just have to understand my choice (or something suitably cosmic and empty like that).
P.S.  I would be remiss not to include in a list of Matrix accomplishments the opening of the cast to all genders and ethnicities.  It is good to see strong, and sometimes even interesting, characters of many colors and sexes.  I like that about the movie.",1068854400,6,3089,4.83111954459203
1893584,5,B00009W2GQ,"I was hesistant to write a review so quickly after seeing revolutions. I saw it again the same week and than read all the love/hate reviews going around everywhere. I read interesting theories and some really inane ones.  It appears so many people had this movie pictured inside their heads and when the wachowski's came up with the most simplistic of answers, they all go home crying and complaining. The machines could not just be destroyed. Life had been created by the humans. A species that has now cultivated the earth and taken it as there own. To erradicate them is irresponsible and the easy way out. The machines had zion and mankind literally by the balls. The only way out was for a half machine half man to sacrifice everything to bridge the gap between the two species.
I'm not here to change anyones minds, if you love or hate it than thats your perogative. But to call this movie mindless or plotless, is to really show how much went over your heads. The brilliance of this trilogy is to create what APPEARS to be a mainstream action epic but throw in much more creative thought and moral questions that have spawned a huge empire dedicated to it's mythology. The game, the animatrix, the comic, all these things feed into how thought provoking these ideas really have become. I'm not saying that if you didn't like it, you didn't ""get it"". But it's obvious some people prefer to have all things handed to them.
How delicious was that tease by the merovingian. Dangling the questions right in front of us. ""How did neo enter mobil ave? How did his mind seperate from his body?"" And as soon as you think he will spoon feed you some mumbo jumbo he doesn't and its almost funny, because like many mainstream art house pictures (Vanilla Sky etc) their are moments where everything is explained. As if at the last minute they got scared and decided to tell all, so no one is confused. This movie stuck to its guns and ended in peace because to kill man or machine is not the answer. We have to get there together.
The series ends with a short convo by the architect and the oracle. The two players who have been guiding each side for their own cause. They come to a compromise, but with a lingering threat that man may yet again make the same mistakes. I for one loved this trilogy. And others opinions are just that. So go ahead with the movie you pictured in your mind, the fact remains that they did not compromise their story for some ironic twist that would have been rediculous, or some unhappy ending that went against everything the story stood for. Our society is so cynicle that endings such as these are never respected because we want destruction and twist endings that feed that cynism. Neo was peace just as Jesus is peace.
Thats the answer folks, plain and simple, staring us in the face every hour of every day. So suspiciously simple yet incredibly elusive. We seek it yet deny it when confronted with it's possibility. Peace.",1068854400,5,2954,4.542213883677299
1893585,2,B00009W2GQ,"Matrix devotees have given it an enthusiastic thumbs-up. Critics have trashed it soundly. I'm in the middle, but leaning more towards disappointment than displeasure.
Straight out of an episode of General Hospital, Matrix III picks up with our hero in a coma with his sobbing girlfriend by his side. And, like the soaps, we all know our hero isn't really dead, just resting - - that is, in some interdimensional train station that's somewhere between the Real World and the Matrix World. Try explaining this one. Well unfortunately they do, for about ten minutes. None of this explanation has any relevance to the rest of the movie, but it sounds really deep and spiritual. Also, we're introduced to an irrelevant ""cute kid"" character, an apparent necessity in all science-fiction stories. At least it's not an Ewok.
The irrelevance continues! In the second installment we had the ""Keymaker."" Now we have to find and do battle with the ""Trainman"" Who's next, Toilet Plunger Man?
Cue back to Morpheus and Trinity, paying a special visit to The Oracle - - wait, that's not her! The late Gloria Foster's character was replaced with Mary Alice. Most moviegoers were already aware of this, but we're still subjected to another rambling, nonsensical, and yes, irrelevant explanation regarding choice and regret. Couldn't you have just said it was the candy and cigarettes?
From here, Morpheus, Trinity and Seraph plan a daring rescue in (where else?) a leather-clad fetish bar so they can bargain for Neo's life with The Merovingian. You remember this guy, don't you? Frenchy, with hot wife who droned on and on about causality? Turns out the entire speech was irrelevant to the movie, but at least he can throw a cool party. Hey, wait a minute? Wasn't Mrs. Hot Wife mad at him for cheating on her? Didn't Frenchy say something along the lines of ""that woman will be the death of me?"" Could have been an interesting plot twist, but I guess it was all... do I need to say it?
Back at the train station, Keanu Reeves has his only memorable line. It's a four-letter word, but it's not ""Whoa."" Trinity shows up and we endure the slo-mo reunion of Neo in his priestly garb and Trinity in her kinky latex. My brain shuts off.
I couldn't bring myself to write a review of the second film because of the loose ends. Any criticism I had of the movie could easily be rebuffed with a simple, ""It'll be answered in the final installment."" Well, guess what? They weren't. None! So many interesting storylines were ignored, it'll spoil the movie if I list them in detail. What I can say is this movie is a high-tech ripoff of obscure books and movies that, for all its espousing, fails to answer even its own questions. Yes, the religious allegory is apparent, but it's not like a lot of thought went into it. Instead, it's more along the lines of the Wachowski's sitting around saying, ""Okay, let's throw in a Zen quote here, steal Frank Herbert's `blind messiah' here, then we can recreate the battle scene in Superman II.""
Finally, a lot of mention was made of the animated DVD, The Animatrix and the videogame Enter the Matrix being tied into the Matrix story.  After viewing both, I can say that the additional footage is largely (you guessed it!) irrelevant.
The one shining compliment I can heap on this movie is Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith. For a guy forced to wear the same clothes and drone in a monotone, he plays it to the hilt and Agent Smith will go down as one of the greatest movie characters since Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry."" Aside from this, I left the theater feeling like I just watched my kid brother play the world's most expensive video-game for the last two hours, except videogames have a more satisfying conclusion.",1068768000,6,3724,4.711656441717792
1893586,5,B00009W2GQ,"This movie is soooo deep and I am glad that I saw it twice, because I really missed some things the first time. Matrix Revolution brings together the pieces you wonder about. The young 16 year old who jumps off the building in Animatrix- is the one who takes the risk and opens the gate during the fight scene with the sentinels. Niaobe shows us the reason why in Enter the Matrix she is the best pilot in town. If it wasn't for Morpheus persistence Neo would never achieve what he has achieved in this movie- PEACE.
Now the deepness of the movie. The machines teaching the humans a lesson on love, war, and peace. And given them a choice between good and evil. Machines has become MORE HUMAN than US. The message is clear. We need to stop our self destruction and stop trying to segregate and separate each other and come to a place of respect and peace.
I am so pleased with this movie and I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD. If you're expecting Matrix moves...then forget it people, although you get something here and there...this movie is for those of who get the MESSAGE and want more.
I hope they come out with more or better yet a SERIES! I haven't seen such good work in such a long time. Oh btw for those of you questioning the Oracle- the one who played her in the other two movies died in real life from diabetes. And I loved how the honored her for her work and explained the changed.

1893588,3,B00009W2GQ,"The first Matrix movie, surely the movie that defines this era of stylized action filmmaking, was brilliant.  The various storytelling elements of that first movie, on further inspection, were a bit cliched.  The thing is, it had enough originality and, more importantly, blind passion and exuberance to make us forget that, at its basic level, this is the same story that's been told countless times (guess we all just have a fascination with the ""One"" concept, no matter if the hero's name is Neo, Frodo, Buffy, or the story told in a little book called the Bible).  Watching Reloaded made me think that The Wachowski Brothers really had no material for a follow-up to the first movie, and Revolutions confirms that doubt.  Revolutions is really just an above-average sci-fi flick with the Matrix name attached to it.  It amazes me that many people use the special effects factor to defend the movie.  ""The effects were great!""  Well, duh.  Great action scenes and beautiful special effects should be expected from this movie.  People like annoying executive producer Joel Silver always talk about how the effects in the Matrix movies can never be duplicated and yada yada yada.  Look, at a certain point, technical prowess is something we stop caring about.  So what if everyone copied bullet-time?  Bullet-time wasn't the reason we all loved the first movie, especially when, arguably, the best scene in the film was two actors in front of a white screen with a TV and couch.  I, for one, would've been fine if the effects of the first Matrix were used in the two sequels in exchange for, oh let's say, a better story.  Like I said, Revolutions is an above-average sci-fi flick.  But above-average isn't good enough.  Our expectations were all probably a little bit high, but so what?  They should be.  Saying that our expectations were too high is, in effect, saying that we should all throw the first movie out the window.  ""You're allowed to like the first movie, but don't base anything off of it.""  We might as well forget the names of the characters.  To me, Revolutions is also the movie that gives us our final opinion on Reloaded.  Reloaded was dense, a bit long, and a little confusing, but was actually a pretty good movie, especially if you give it a second or third viewing.  Had this final installment resolved the questions posed in Reloaded, it would have made that movie better as well. But because Revolutions so effortlessly pretends that the events of Reloaded didn't even happen, save an annoying French character with a goofy name in a movie that's full of goofy names, that second installment is devalued to ""a big hunk of action with one great scene involving the Architect and an unneeded 20-minute Rap video called Zion.""  The film plays like a successful rock band counting the platinum awards for its new album before they start writing any songs, and the once semi-cool-if-ultimately-unimportant dialogue now borders on self-parody.  There is a bit of dialogue in this movie where the audience actually started chuckling.  Morpheus' speech in Reloaded was off-key, but it was at least serviceable.  The Wachowskis might as well have deferred the scripting to hardcore fans and the directing duties to Ang Lee or, heck, even Peter Jackson.  In the end, I am disappointed because there were just so many incredible possibilities for these two sequels.  Even a few of the predictions made by my friends after walking out of the second movie, none of them particularly hardcore sci-fi fans, were more interesting.  These movies could have truly been spectacular in all facets, not just ""hey there's a hundred Smiths on screen"" or ""I guess Keanu can kinda act...sorta.""  The Wachowskis attempted to focus these two movies more on the emotions of individuals and not the enormity of the first film.  That's perfectly fine, if it had been done well.  They make us care about these characters without giving us a reason to.  Even a seemingly lock-for-emotional-impact scene in Revolutions was handled awkwardly with too much ironic detachment and not nearly enough, well, emotion.  And here I thought that George Lucas was the only director with the ability to mess up a love story that seemed impossible of ruin.  The once ultra-cool Morpheus is not only the puppy dog of Neo, but apparently the Fresh Prince's wife as well.  And Trinity, once a strong character, is now the Princess always being captured by King Koopa.  I thought Super Mario was a plumber, not a cop who stopped a speeding bus from exploding.  The fact that Neo is Superman-Jesus takes these two integral characters completely out of the action.  At least the admittedly well-crafted set pieces of Reloaded made me say ""whoa"" once or twice.  Revolutions just makes me wanna circle my calendar for the day The Return Of The King is released.",1068768000,3,4835,4.883435582822086
1893589,1,B00009W2GQ,"This movie is boring. I feel like I am watching Aliens and Superman. I feel like that they are cutting some sences from Aliens and pasting them here and there... cutting some more from Superman and pasting them over there.  Story is not good at all. The movie only mentions the philosophical issues brought up by the second movie.  It doesn't really discuss what it is so special about these issues.  Most of the time, the movie only mentions the wording. There is no meaning behind the wording.
IMO, the second and the third movies switches the focus to Agent Smith. I think they should have more dialogs for Agent Smith rather to just make him punch and punch and punch something all the time everytime I see him show up in the movie.
Maybe this is why the movie is so boring.  There is nothing to tell regarding The One and his followers anymore.  And the contents from the special effects are 10-20 years old. (i.e. you punch me, I punch you back. There is nothing special about this.)",1068768000,6,989,4.472222222222222
1893590,2,B00009W2GQ,"Mmmm. Loved the fight scenes. The effects were great, as per usual but I was disappointed with the ending.
The main characters seem to lose everything to save Zion. We are not sure if Smith is really gone and the show ends with what seems like a stand off between the machines and the humans. It seems that we need another movie to fix all this.
Morpheus was watered down to a co-pilot. Why was Jada Pinket needed in the role of ""super-pilot""? Morpheus was the Man! He was a key target of the machines, the carrier of the faith and the one to find Neo! He deserves better. He should have done the break-neck flying to save Zion. (By the way with all the defensive hardware that Zion had you might have though that a 1,000 EMP's would have been the ideal thing to have - slight plot boo-boo)

MATRIX III - REVISITED!
Here is my way to handle Matrix III. Keep Jada at the love interest level for Morpheus (capable but not too much screen time). Have the real gang, Morpheus, Trinity and Neo go up against the machines and Smith.
The Zion gang would be holding out with the EMP weapons but running out of time against the hoards. Neo and crew must stop the machines! But Smith is in the way, he too want to smash Zion but will let the main computer have its way and do his work before taking out the machine. He just has to keep some of these humans at bay. And he wants Neo!
Neo and Smith duke it out while Trinity and Morpheus sabotage the central computer. Neo gets in trouble with Smith, Trinity saves him but gets taken down by Smith. Neo blows a gasket, gets into super rage, raw human emotions powers him up like an a-bomb. He whips Smith in shreds and totals the main computer.
At his super power level Neo will burn out and loose it unless all that power is channeled away. He uses all this power to alter time and rescue Trinity but looses his power afterwards with the world now at peace.
Clich but its a fantasy! It should lift you up not let you down. My wife could see my disappointment as we left the theater. She thinks that the Matrix team just ran out of ideas trying to get both Matrix 2 and 3 filmed at the same time. If they had taken some time after Matrix 2 to think about it the outcome might have been a lot better.
Soooo..... About the directors cut for the DVD release. Let fix the ending to something we can cheer about.
One other observation. Neo and Trinity... There is just no chemistry. The closer they get, the more strained and forced it appears. Their love story comes across much stronger when they are apart like the scene with the Frenchman and Trinity when trying to rescue Neo. Frenchman: ""Would you die for him?"" Trinity cocks gun ""Believe it!""",1068768000,2,2682,4.289940828402367
1893591,2,B00009W2GQ,"The final volume of the tri-part Matrix movies was highly disappointing and utterly predictable. Whilst the first Matrix at least had mystery, discovery and special effects, the second and third installments have been very weak. Part II consisted of some story development, interesting new characters, a long highway chase scene, but it left confusing loose ends, many of which are not tied up in the ""Revolutions"". This last film is weak, lacks imagination, and adds nothing in the special effects department that we have not seen before.
Mr Smith is not nearly disturbing enough (some psychological element would have been welcome here), Morpheus has lost all sense of mystery and Trinity has become ... feeble. In fact, all of the major characters are sadly uni-dimensional. Neo, who was originally on a path of self-discovery has become unconvincing as The One. If he were that, he would have gotten himself out of the subway station at the very least. In addition, the hopelessness of the people against the machines isn't nearly dark enough - that should have happened in the second movie to a much deeper extent, if we are to follow the traditional trilogy.
The only saving grace of the movie is some fantastic performances by peripheral characters. The editors obviously thought so too, since much of the story focuses on them. The introduction of even more new characters seems superfluous, and a cynical view is that they are there to give some substance to the movie (it doesn't work).
Of course, Trinity becomes a sacrifice but not before setting eyes on the sun (standard fantasy saga storyline, and obvious symbolism), and Mr Smith proves to be Neo's alterego (who'd have thought it ... the path to knowing thyself is inward). Self-sacrifice is the answer, of course.
Although the storyline is standard, I can't help but feel that the final volume could have been more impressive and its interpretation more mature.
Disappointing all round.",1068681600,5,1954,5.033950617283951
1893592,5,B00009W2GQ,"To the Wachowski brothers, I say, thank you. You didn't underestimate your audience, you didn't compromise your vision, and what you created is wonderful.
Revolutions brings to an end the greatest science fiction epic ever put on film, and does so beautifully. Though it requires an attentive audience that is willing to think about the story, about its symbolism and its implications, about the questions it answers as well as those it leaves open to interpretation and debate, it never the less fulfills, and regardless of what the critics and the nit-pickers and the nay-sayers claim, it does resolve nicely, concluding in the only way that it really could. It also definitely lives up to all that came before it. Revolutions is a fantastic film, which will be even better when viewed consecutively with the first two movies, because ultimately, its all one continous story.
This is a story gives back to the viewer that which the viewer is willing to put into it. If you want nothing more than action and special fx, it delivers, and if you want something to ponder for years to come, it delivers this as well.
Personally, in the future, if I ever see anything that even remotely compares with it in content and passion, I will be amazed. I doubt that's likely though.",1068681600,7,1272,4.786363636363636

1893595,2,B00009W2GQ,"Ever since coming out of the movie theatre after seeing The Matrix: Reloaded, my mind had been thinking over and over about the possible great endings to such a phenomenon. I was thinking perhaps that the Wachowski brothers had purposely left us very on edge for a mind-blowing conclusion to this sci-fi epic. Well, very sadly, I was wrong. Friends of mine and I had increasing anticipation for Revolutions, expecting so much from it, which only made the end result even more depressing.
After both The Matrix and Reloaded, you thought that the brothers could not go wrong, they were able to create the story in 1999, sustain its mystique and action in May 2003, but have no idea how to end such a complex saga. Everything was perfect, even down to the soundtracks - you knew that they couldn't go wrong at this point. And it's such a shame that it all ended the way it did, I sat in my seat of the theatre just thinking ""that cannot be the end?!?! It can't be!"", expecting there to be another scene of dialogue to explain absolutely everything, to give all the answers... but it never came. Instead, you got a very cliched ending, which would annoy every one of the hardcore Matrix fans out there - the philosophy had vanished, the amazing kung-fu sequences, and coolness of the all black look and sunglasses - all for a cold Zion and a dull feeling while watching the film. I regret for what I will write, I hate criticising this film because of the greatness of the first two but certain things have to be said. I had no idea that such an ending was coming.
Continuing exactly where Reloaded left off, you find both Neo and Agent Smith (in human form as Bane) in a coma, and the humans preparing for battle against the machines who are drilling their way through to Zion. Then you find Neo in a world between worlds - between the real world and the matrix, with you having no idea how he got there. The story then speaks for itself. With some poor pieces of dialogue, used ideas and too many special effects - Revolutions was nothing special compared to its predecessors.
The Matrix - all about those beautifully choreographed fight scenes, interesting philosophical conversation and the cool all black costumes: this was not to be in the third instalment. There are two, very brief hand-to-hand combat scenes (including the final showdown with Neo Vs Smith) and an overlong CGI sentinel battle, which was not what Matrix action sequences were about. Yes, have some gunfire and explosions, but you know it was really all about how much arse could be kicked by Neo, Morpheus and Trinity. Impressive yes, but Revolutions did not really look, or even feel, like a Matrix movie. It didn't have any would-be favourite lines, memorable, yet inspirational lines by Morpheous, like the previous two films had. To put it simply, it just wasn't as enjoyable nor as gripping as the first or as action packed as the second. And the ending fight scene, the one we all had really been looking forward to, was a huge let down, especially coming from the Wachowski brothers - you get tired of too much flying and not enough actual fighting between the two men, it gets very confusing indeed. And Neo being ""The One"" certainly doesn't act it because he is made to look weak against Smith in the end. You were maybe thinking, ""Ok, this is what we have all been waiting for at last"" but, to put it simply, no.
Character development was another big factor in this film - there was none! The Merovigian, the comical French program, had only enough screen time to eat just three olives. You would have thought that this guy had a lot to do with the Matrix, as Reloaded had made him out to be an important, dangerous person, but his character is cut short in a very blunt way, you don't even find out who he is or what he does. And for his wife? In short - she has one line. Plus, too many new characters were introduced here, and took up way too much screen time and were insignificant to the story. Keanu Reeves was off screen for the majority of the film... and he's ""The One"", the main character. And Morpheus? The producers had not only put a knife in Laurence Fisburne's back, but a bullet as well, as he had no real part in this film. His scenes were too short and he did not have enough lines to say.
I suppose visual effects really saved this film, as the plot spiralled out of control, becoming way to complex, even for the Wachowski's to comprehend - they either lost interest, ran out of special effects, or most likely ran out of ideas. They spent three months just designing the rain drops in the battle between Neo and Smith! That three months could have been spent on the ending at least, let alone the whole film itself. Which makes you wonder - why release both films in such a rush? It seems in the four years the spent making the two, all efforts were concentrated on trying to make Reloaded the great follow up success that it is, then only leaving just enough time to fit in two fight scenes and a sentinel attack for the third instalment. To be honest, I would have rather waited an extra year, perhaps even more, for a really good ending rather then a quickly put together climax, because I had favoured the strategy of leaving so many unanswered questions, a mystery - then for them to explain it all, end it completely in Revolutions. It never happened.
But now, as I and many others have witnessed, there will be an eternal disappointment and resentfulness to Revolutions and how great it could have been, I hope the Wachowski's realise this as much as we do.",1068681600,,5566,4.511881188118812
1893596,5,B00009W2GQ,"With the third installment of the Matrix trilogy, the Wachowski Brothers have found Spirituality: Redemption, Catharsis, Family bonding and most of all Love.
This is the most personal film of the trilogy and for that it will probably get slammed by those who feel that The Matrix should only be about balletic fights, blowing up machines or buildings or killing people.  But there has always been a strong undercurrent of Spirituality in all of the Matrix films: it's just that here, it is in the forefront. The battle scenes act as a respite from the scenes of Love and bonding between the cast members: Sati and the Oracle, Sati and her father and mother, Neo and Trinity, Morpheus and Niobe to name a few.
One of the nice things about all of the Matrix films is that the Wachowski's have made sure to populate their movies with all races. Their future world embraces all people and in particular Women as Warriors. Niobe, Trinity and Zee all have an agenda and do not hesitate to physically act upon it and in this Matrix this means they save their men from death and Zion from destruction.
""Matrix Revolutions"" is a beautiful film, filled with glorious images, do not hate it because it wears its heart on its sleeve: Love is All We Need, after all.",1068681600,3,1253,4.618834080717488
1893597,2,B00009W2GQ,"So here you have The Matrix, a modern-day classic describted as the 'thinking man's action movie'. It actually disregards categorisation though, and appeals to a broad range of people. What do you do next? You make two distinctly average sequels, and ruin the whole thing, that's what. The fact that this third film - Matrix Revolutions - is a slight improvement on Matrix Reloaded is sadly not enough to repair the damage done.
For a start, Revolutions is ridiculously over-complicated. Your traditional film might start with some questions, and slowly answer them during the course of the movie; Revolutions on the other hand begins with many questions, and ends with many more. Annoyingly, this is despite the fact that several characters try and answer your questions as you go along, none more so than the Oracle, who, if we're being honest, just confuses matters even more. It had all been too simple: in The Matrix, we had a classic good versus evil battle. Now however, the good is splintered into good, alright, dislikeable and bad people inside Zion, and the bad is too puzzling to believe: the Merovingian, the Trainman, the Architect, an unplugged and unhinged Agent Smith not accountable to the machines.... Who is working for whom? And why? It must have been tough for the Wachowski brothers trying to establish some sense of purpose and clarity in the middle of all that, because for the viewer, it is difficult to find any.
Secondly, the original film's major strength has all but been destroyed. I'm talking about Morpheous of course. His was a pheonomenal character: cool, swarve, wise and strong, he was Neo's version of Luke Skywalker's Obi-Wan Kenobi - but better. But by the start of Revolutions and beyond, he is barely a bit-part character. He makes absolutely no decisions, leads absolutely no people, has little authority and appears to have little conviction. Everything about him is insipid and weak, and to my mind, it makes Revolutions a worse film; this may be simplistic, but taking the first film's most likeable character and reducing him to nothing leaves a big void.

i'm not sure where all the philosophy talk in this movie fits in but it seems wholey unnecessary.  the talk with the indian family was droll and didn't seem to serve much purpose in the movie.  maybe if any character in this movie delivered any line with any amount of personality and conviction it wouldn't matter.  the characters couldn't make me care about anything,  except when agent smith expressed his disgust for humans, that was awesome when he said(in not so many words..):""anything this weak was meant to die.""  that was sweet. he was probably the only actor that 'acted'.  if a scene was enjoyable it was because he was in it.  it's frustrating watching keanu because his performance is void of character.
there are some action scenes throughout the first half or so of the movie.  they're there.
there's a 'war' scene, and the swirling sentinels provide nice visuals.  this gives you a nice break from over wrought dialogue.

Extremely interesting visual effects, as always, and a plot that seems to twist and turn. For those who haven't seen the first two, it might be a little confusing. For those who did see the first two - you might really enjoy this more.
The action is intense with an incredible visual sequence of the Sentenals who are the machine that are trying to kills human. The finale is very open ended and leaves itself for your personal interpretation. The final fight sequence between Neo and Agent Smith - played by the very talented Hugo Weaving (Peaches, Lord of the Rings 1, 2 & 3, Babe:Pig In the City) - is incredible and visually amazing in detail and imagination. Hugo performance of the stoic and robotic reading of the computer program that went AWOL - is funny, mysterious and scary - all at the same time.

First of all PEOPLE, this is what Sci-Fi's are all about, ""The Un-Imaginable & Artificial Intelligence"". I appreciated the film writers keeping to the script from the very first dialog of the first movie.
What I mean by that is sticking with the definition of the themes and Characters;
((((MATRIX)))): A substance in which something is embedded or enclosed.  ORACLE:  source of wisdom: somebody or something considered being a source of knowledge, wisdom, or prophecy.
((((AGENT)))):  Somebody representing another.
((((TRINITY)))): The union of the three (Neo, Morpheus & Trinity).
((((RELOADED)))):  To put a new load into something (i.e. Film in a camera, HINT! remember they ran out of film and went bankrupt!)
((((REVOLUTION)))):  A dramatic change in ideas and practice.  NOW, I close you with this.
The Matrix Trilogy was to provoke Thought, Criticism, Idealism, Physical Capability, Love, Unity, Division, Faith and lastly to Form Moral Belief.  The people that were disappointed may not be true fans of creativity and originality, they were maybe looking for trend (about like what Charlie's Angels did with BULLET-TIME, What-a-JOKE).
What I took from all three movies were: ""If you don't STAND for what you believe in, you can FALL for anything"" Not to mention allowing the non-believers to come inside of you (Agent's Smith's cloning method).  The movie could have been 8 hours long; I still don't think the people would have caught the subliminal message.  Everthing that has a beginning, must have an end...... Way to close the book.
I can't leave w/o saying:  GOD BLESS YOU first Oracle and Aaliyah, you would have been great in the final wrap....",1068595200,,1830,5.148648648648648
1893603,3,B00009W2GQ,"A film by the Wachowski Brothers
I had thought that the Matrix trilogy was actually going somewhere, that there would be some sort of resolution, some real change in the world we are presented.  Unfortunately, there was not, and my disappointment in the conclusion to the trilogy magnifies any other flaw in Revolutions which I would normally have overlooked with a more satisfying ending.  I walked out of the theater thinking, ""that was it?"".  The promise of the Matrix was a big payoff to the hype and a big payoff to the story.  Neither was delivered.
When the movie begins, we know that we are closing in on the end to the final chapter of the Matrix.  The machines are only hours away from Zion and the final battle of the war is at hand.  Neo (Keanu Reeves) is unconscious and is lost between the Matrix and the real world.  When we last saw Neo, he was in the real world but was able to stop sentinels with the force of his will (as he is able to do with bullets when he is in the matrix).  The energy required to do this is the reason why he is unconscious now.  Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) fight to free Neo from this odd in between area which resembles a train station, a train station from which Neo cannot free himself.  Eventually Neo is freed and we enter the final stages of the war.  Neo decides to personally take the fight to the Machine City while the freed humans fight to keep Zion free.
What more do you really need to know?  We have scenes with the Oracle (Mary Alice, replacing the recently deceased Gloria Foster), and Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) is also back.  Surprisingly, the character with the most humanity is Agent Smith.  Smith is, of course, a program in the Matrix.  He is less real than most of the other characters in the movie, but yet he is more compelling and he felt more human.  The fight sequences are, of course, well done.  Neo's battle with Agent Smith near the end of the movie is probably their best fight since the first movie (the subway scene), and this may be because, in part, the end is uncertain.  Because of the overwhelming odds stacked up against the humans, and because of how powerful Agent Smith has become, all of Neo's vaunted powers no longer seem to be enough.  Part of my complaint against the second movie was that we never believed that Neo could lose.  This is no longer true, and I feel the movie is stronger because of that.
I have heard complaints about various things throughout the movie, but even though I wasn't blown away, I had no problem with the first 90% of the movie.  I wasn't overly impressed, but I had no problem with it.  Unfortunately, in my view, the entire movie was undermined by the ending.  Sure, the action was good and I even enjoyed the big battle scene in Zion, but the ending left me unsatisfied.  With all of the questions raised by the first two movies (especially the first movie), the ending didn't really answer any of them.  The ending also didn't resolve anything.  The third movie of a trilogy has somewhat of a storytelling obligation to end the story.  Maybe the point the Wachowski's were trying to make was that there is no end to the story, but if that's the case it feels like more of a cop-out than a success.  All of the time and energy expended in three movies gets us to a point that is not significantly different than that from which we began the journey.  This is a movie which the more I think about it, the less impressed I am with what I saw.  It was just a very unsatisfying ending to a trilogy that had such potential and that promised so much.  Ultimately, the Matrix Revolutions did not deliver.",1068595200,4,3654,4.441441441441442

 There are some good new characters for exemple Indian family andthe man who's saying that he is God. Mr. Smith shows that he is real, final enemy, who has a lot power and nasty face. Neo is going to be saviour and Trinity will help he so far as it possible. The people of Sion will fight brave and making many sacrifices to protect the last human race city. Robots are very cruel without feelings and the final battle is showed awesome well. Musics are chosen very well and specially the last battle between Neo and Mr. Smith offers great music.

1893605,3,B00009W2GQ,"THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS was toted as being the conclusion to ""The Matrix"" set of films. It was supposed to have all these unbelievable effects, topping off what had been a break through trilogy in filmmaking. It was also supposed to tie all the loose ends of the series and end the war between the machines and the humans. Well, THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS filled most those predictions.

The film does have some amazing special effects. For example, the fight in Zion, taking a cue from the best of war films, is an amazing piece of cinematic brilliance. Everything in those scenes, from the score to the sounds to the lack of dialogue, unite together to form a magnificent display that illustrates both the humanity of Zion's citizens and the directorial power of the Wachowski brothers. The film does tie together many of the loose ends that were purposely left undone in THE MATRIX RELOADED and the movie does end the war between the humans and the machines.

However, just as THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS displays the skill the Wachowski's have as directors, it also blatantly illustrates their lack of skill as writers. To begin with, the dialogue is terrible. Poor Mr. Reeves was beginning to break away from the ""Bill and Ted"" image that has haunted him throughout his career. THE MATRIX re-launched his career. In the first two movies we saw some emotion and some good acting. Then this film comes along: in some of his most emotional scenes, he's given dialogue that is plain awful which makes him sound like the old surfer from the 80s we all love. Hardly any of the other actors fare better, except perhaps for The Oracle and Agent Smith.

Not only that, but even though THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS fulfills predictions and lives up to part of the hype, the film ultimately fails to bring true resolution. There is no catharsis. The film ends, but one leaves the theatre feeling cheated. The end of the movie leaves open the possibility of future films or perhaps a television series of some sort. That's not how it was supposed to be.

THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS wasn't anything like I thought it would be. It makes the previous film, THE MATRIX RELOADED, a quite better film in comparison. There is no catharsis. Things aren't the same and the matrix still exists. Go figure.",1068508800,,2268,4.748730964467005

1893607,4,B00009W2GQ,"Even though I found Matrix Reloaded a major disappointment, I still knew without doubt I would have to see Revolutions when it came out.  There was too much potential that just might yet be fulfilled, too many loose ends just begging to be tied.  While hardly a cinematic masterpiece, Revolutions is indeed a fulfilling climax to the Matrix series.  There are the usual bugaboos:  mediocre acting (except for the outstanding Hugo Weaving), a slew of rather unlikeable protagonists (I can't bring myself to like any of the characters except the big three of Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus) and an often ameaturish script, but one recurring problem with the Matrix--all the overblown psychobabble posing as philosophy--actually makes some sense this time around.  Some die-hard Matrix fans may be disappointed by the relative lack of action in this entry, but don't be fooled by a few negative reviews into thinking the Matrix has gone soft.  Revolutions packs some devastating punches, they're just more concentrated this time.  The robotic invasion of Zion is spectacular (if a bit unimaginative), Neo's encounter with a ""real-world"" Agent Smith is intense and provocative, and of course the ultimate showdown is a mindblowing exhibition that does NOT end as you'd expect.  As a Christian, by far the most powerful element for me in Revolutions is the strong Christ-imagery, which comes full circle in the moving finale.  Perhaps this is one turn-off for Matrix devotees who like to see the series as a repudiation of any orthodoxy.  Funny how so many ""open-minded"" people refuse to be at all open to any concept of an absolute truth.  Of course, Revolutions incorporates themes from several philosophies, but in the end it is the Christian element that shines most strongly.  In any event, there's something here for anyone who's come this far into the saga. As a slick package of modern spirituality, pop psychology, killer action, conspiracy theory, and high-octane FX, the Matrix Series is a winner that is ultimately more than the sum of its parts. And Revolutions is the story's climactic exclamation point.",1068508800,85,2109,5.11661807580175

1893610,5,B00009W2GQ,"I pretty much had my own idea of how this movie was going to be when I finished watching 'The Matrix: Reloaded' this past Spring. 'Reloaded' was somewhat of a disappointment for me, but it was neccessary. Since May I had it stuck in my head that 'Reloaded' was meant to bridge the gap between the first movie and the last movie, and that is was. Just as the first was a perfect, mysterious and fantasic beginning, 'Revolutions' is a no-holds barred, rollercoaster of action and emotion that closes out the trilogy with a bang. There is an entire action sequence that involves the machines penetrating Zion (the last living city, for those of you not in the know) where we are taken away from the main characters for about 40 minutes -- and you don't even notice! It is so easy to be engrossed in the action in this movie. All I ever heard was the hype about that darn freeway chase in 'Reloaded' that didn't seem to amount to anything. The action sequences in this movie are completely wild and over-the-top. And if action isn't what you are looking for, everything else is still here. The love story between Neo and Trinity is at it's strongest by this point, and of course with the way things work out, it would have to be. This movie also isn't as confusing as some would have you believe. As someone who hasn't submerged himself in all of the 'Matrix' multimedia that are said to be vital (video-games, cartoons, books, magazines, underwear, shot-glasses, vitamins...maybe I'm getting caried away), I walked away from this movie with a perfect understanding of the series as a whole and overall, I loved every minute of this movie. As said before, 'Reloaded' may have been a bore, but it made this movie possible. Don't let that disappointment (I know a lot of people were) damper your mood for seeing this movie. 'Revolutions' is a cinematic milestone. A must-see for anyone with even a casual interest in the 'Matrix' world.",1068508800,4,1930,4.646198830409356
1893611,1,B00009W2GQ,"When the first Matrix came out, it more or less revolutionized the action genre.  Old-style gunfights could never again compete with the groundbreaking special effects provided.  The martial arts of an American action movie were finally brought up to par, more or less, with many of Hollywood's Hong Kong counterparts.  The science behind the film of course, was about as goofy as it gets but the story was compelling and the characters likeable.  The acting made up for the pseudo-philosophical preaching of the script.  Characters like Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith proved to be just as engaging as the protagonists of Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus were.  All in all it was an exceptionally satisfying action film.
 The second volume in the trilogy did a great injustice to the first by more or less throwing the entire premise away.  The dialogue was trite and clich and the acting was sub-par to say the least.  The film started out with one of the most ridiculous space-fillers of all time.  Something like Club Mtv resurrected for the new millennium.  The only redeeming factors of the film were the spectacular action sequences.  A memorable car chase featuring evaporating gunmen with dreadlocks and a signpost being used like a baseball bat for Agent Smith-balls were visual highlights for the entire year.  The Wachowski's clearly fumbled though.
 Along comes Matrix: Revolutions.  This film is loaded with all the negative baggage of the second film with little of its redeeming qualities.  Besides bring back a dance party that should have never made it into the second film, this film somehow deprives Agent Smith of the sinister charm from the other two films although all the best lines are still his.  The mumbo-jumbo that Morpheus continually enunciated has spread like a virus to all the characters.  The tension between Neo and Trinity in the first film fell off a cliff in the second film and gets even worse here.  It's almost as if the Wachowski's have taken screenwriting lessons from George Lucas.  The characters in this film are so unlikable that one really hopes the robots with finish them off, or at least, kill all the humans who have had lines.  The action sequences, while entertaining, fail to live up to, or really approach in any fashion, the first two.  The only exceptional one involves the initial machine entrance into Zion.
 Matrix: Revolutions is one of the worst films of the year.  Countless films have at this point knocked off and downright plagiarized the effects of the first Matrix.  Others have even ripped off parts of the plot.  Matrix: Revolutions is as bad as what is at the bottom of those barrels.  The plot doesn't seem to have any direction.  The ideas behind it are muddled.  The final battle between Neo and Smith even ends in a way that has no explanation.  It's a cheap cop out.  Even Monica Bellucci in latex can't save this debacle.  People are going to see this film anyway but I only can hope they throw their money away on a matinee.",1068508800,16,2996,4.848126232741618

1893622,3,B00009W2GQ,"Whether you liked ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" or not you'll probably find yourself going to see this one no matter how you look at it. To be frank, this isn't a bad movie and neither was Reloaded. But again, the first Matrix movie had a such a level of superiority that you couldn't top.  The things that were new and original are not anymore. Not only that but in this movie we spend LESS time in the Matrix.
As I mentioned in my review on ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" the second movie is only a bridge to the third one.  In this last installment things come together and it actually makes Reloaded look better.  The acting isn't bad although the dialogue could use a touch up.  They managed to explain how the Oracle looked different in a very believable way for The Matrix.
The dialogue however could use a touch up.  It isn't that the lines are stupid, it's one of those ""I can't believe they said that"" kind of messed up dialogue.  The other part where the movie falls short is that no matter what, the character Neo still has little emotion.  Even with his love-interest in Trinity we still see little emotion.
A lot of plot holes from the second movie are filled and it makes Reloaded look better.  But the overall plot of the film is actually a bit of a drag.  The story is interesting , but the plot is nothing special.  The movie is all about saving Zion, the last human civilization.  The problem is that the movie spends TOO MUCH time on Zion.  Expect this to be a war movie mostly, full of all the war movie themes of love, drama, and carnage of course.
Let's face it.  This movie was also overhyped, just like Reloaded was.  Overhype always tends to make a movie worse because we expect so much from it and then we don't get it.  This is no exception.  Revolutions is a good movie but it misses what the first two had.  That my friends is The Matrix itself.  The characters don't spend nearly as much time in The Matrix, so don't expect a lot of fight scenes.
Revolutions is only good to see once, however.  It isn't a bad film but that doesn't make it good.  Unlike the first two movies, you lose interest in Revolutions fast.  You see it once and then you know how it ends.  There are no really cool scenes that keep you coming back (I.e. the first Matrix had the Lobby Shooting Spree and the second one had the whole Freeway Chase scene).  This one is actually rather boring a second time because the movie is drowned out in a lot of dialogue and overlong emotional scenes.  The final battle is a little long and repetitive and as with the second one, you'll have to piece it all together.
The first two Matrix movies were better than this I would say.  At least the first two I could watch more than twice, but as I said, the first one set a bar that the next two films had to live up to, and they just couldn't do it.",1068422400,2,2825,4.274952919020715

The movie is by no means perfect, but it's very good. All of the Matrix movies compel the audience to think, while at the same time provide some of the best action sequences put on film. All of the things outlined in the first two movies come together. I just finished watching this movie in theaters 2 1/2 hours ago and still have a tension headache from this movie's intense action scenes, respectfully. In my view, the best way to understand the Matrix movies in general is to understand the importance of technology as well as our sense of individuality. It seems thats the reason why the Matrix was set up by the machines so that a human being's individuality could be suppressed via the illusional world established by the machines. Overall, the Matrix films best articulate the human will to survive with the added legendary 'messiah' belief thrown in. I wish the climax could have been a little more dramatic but overall I don't think it detracts from the effectiveness of the film. Run, don't walk, to see it!",1068422400,3,1147,4.655172413793103

For those of you who appreciate sensationalist manufactured computer generated nonsense, this movie is perfect for you.  I admit, I had fun, but it wasn't worth my nine dollars.  And at the end - no, the possibility for a sequel does not exist.  The end of war is peace, and that's what humanity got.  By the way, the acting was sub-par.  And the best example of a monologue in this film is Agent Smith's ""chilling"" interrogation at the end of the film.  In the end, the Wachowski brothers simply got together some drugs, an intro to philosophy textbook, and some computers.  ""The Matrix"" series is the result.  Also, the entire series is a downward spiral.  The acting does deteriorate, the dialogue is wretched, and to put it simply, the Wachowski brothers let success go to their heads.

  things i liked:
  AMAZING visual effects.i was totally blown away.
  great, great, machine battle.that alone
  was worth my 7.50.
  the battle with smith was better than i could have
  imagined.some would say two people flying through the air at incredible speeds is fake and stupid,but i loved it.
  and now for the bad things:
 too much talking and not quite enough action.what i could say though is that they did make up for that during the machine and smith battles.what also dissapointed me was revolutions almost complete lack of martial arts.the kung fu was kept to a bare minimum. and what the hell happened to the oracle? i think it was half explained at some point but i never fully grasped that.oh! i just realized something else. there was no bullet time at all. anyway,I saw revolution on sunday and when trinity died,the whole audience laughed.and during that scene i realized that neo and trinity have no chemistry together whatsoever. it sounds like i hated this movie but im just pointing out some things they could have changed.this might sound odd but i thought there was too much backround chorus and no rock music.they also left the trainman with not enough explanation or action. one more thing i did like was the little girl.she was cute and had a suprisingly large part in this film.well,hopefully ill see this in imax,and then ill see it again, and then its off to see return of the king! no honestly, i loved this movie. if you see three movies this winter, see matrix revolutions, matrix revolutions,and return of the king.and if you still want to go to the movies,see matrix revolutions again.",1068422400,,1734,4.733333333333333

I respectfully disagree.  I do not believe that the writers/directors planned on there being only one film.

However, after three times more, you start to realize how amazing this movie is. Personally speaking, I think the movie close almost perfectly with all the two previous movies. More than this, it makes Reloaded a better movie -I love Reloaded- but Revolutions add more info that helps Reloaded for a better understanding.
All you need is to put some attention in some clues here, there and everywhere in Revolutions and then you start to notice the meaning of the movie and the meaning of the whole trilogy and the circle begins to get closed.  A circle that started back in 1999 when The Matrix took the world by storm. One thing, you can not compare Revolutions with the Matrix. That is beyond any comparisson but if you take Reloaded+Revolutions then you probably will have a 258 minutes movie -a gigantic one- that honors The Matrix. Hail The Matrix Reloaded Revolutions.

If you ask me What is the Matrix Trilogy major achivement? Well I would answer you with this: It was and is to put Philosophy outside the scholar's classroom and into the everyday world.

1893629,3,B00009W2GQ,"...but that's about all the praise I can give this movie.
When I first saw The Matrix in the theaters back in 1999, it was everything that Star Wars Episode 1 wasn't: thought-provoking ideas, mind-bending action sequences, swift pacing and a great plot.  Roughly four years later, the Wachowski brothers are making the same mistakes that George Lucas is making.  In Reloaded we were given some great action sequences (the freeway chase is one of my all-time favorite action scenes); but what the movie had in spades, namely, pseudo-philosophical gibberish that might impress someone who didn't take Philosophy 110 for their Humanities requirement and a string of seemingly pointless characters (Persephone?  The Merovingian? The Keymaker?) the audience didn't want or need.  At least Reloaded's conclusion left the possibility that Revolutions would wrap-up all of the loose ends.
Unfortunately, the directors did not answer any of the important questions raised by the first two films and introduced even more characters and scenes that leave the viewer wondering who these people were and why were they so important.  Why do we waste 15 minutes of Neo talking to a Hindi family?  How do the Merovingian and Persephone fit into the whole scheme?  Why is there no explanation of Neo's powers in the real world?  Will humans be liberated from the Matrix now?
The movie itself is mildly entertaining.  It has some great fight scenes (unfortunately, none of which match the intensity of the freeway chase in Reloaded) and spectacular special effects, but the acting is overly-reliant on cliched one-liners (""You did it,"" ""No, we did it"" etc.) that made me cringe everytime I heard one.  The final fight between Neo and Agent Smith is entertaining and has fantastic visuals, but far too short and leaves me wondering ""Why didn't Neo just do that in the first place?""
So, if you turn off your mind to any of the questions raised by the first two Matrix movies, Revolutions works as an so-so sci-fi action movie with some really cool fights and effects.

I did like Reloaded a little better but I'm not disappointed with this one.  I DID have one problem with it, however.  They replaced the Oracle!  Okay, I've thought this through from the point of view of the story and I can't find a reason why they would do this.  There really was no reason to replace her, story-wise.  That means the reason had to be on the actress' end.  (I haven't heard anything on this, but if she died....that would be a good reason and I'll stop complaining real quick.  Hopefully, she didn't.)  Anyway, there must've been some dispute or something if that didn't happen. Regardless, the movie it'self was very good.  A great way to end the trilogy.  Taken as a whole (all three together as one movie), it's awesome.  All you people out there that tore this movie apart....try to look at it as one movie, not part 3.

This movie shows our planet and the pods in more detail, which I found fascinating since they just hinted at this in the other films. The first Matrix was about Birth, the second about Life and this one all about Death. You can feel death in the air and it is spooky. All the Matrix movies are so different and all have their own feel. I found myself not believing how good this movie is! The action scenes are reminiscent of Star Ship Troopers very much. The Captains in this movie make the movie with their superior acting and deep love for Zion. Lots of people have to have faith in Neo, since they are so outnumbered by the machines; they stand no chance on their own. They have to believe in miracles and you can see their struggle in doing so. A true battle of the spirit and the questions one must face in believing in more then one can see.

Guess what everyone, the ground was already broken by the first matrix. The purpose of the second and third movies in a trilogy is to advance the plot not to invent something new. Bad acting? overly long shootouts? cheesy lines in a pleasant overacting sauce? Not any worse than the first matrix.
now that I've got that out of the way, there were some notable faults in the movie. Like Matrix Reloaded, the ""pep talks"" in Zion were overdone and lacking in substance. lets face it, Patton is AWOL. The ""touching emotional scenes"" felt about 30 minutes too long. during one death scene I found myself thinking ""just die already!"" Not exactly the desired effect I believe. during the final fight scene the special effects (while cool) were way overdone. SFX should support the fight not the other way around. It would have been nice to see a little military strategy in the real world battle scenes. as it stands it had all the forethought of pre-revolutionary war battle lines. There was no maneuvering to speak of, no combined arms tactics, very little use of cover or concealment, and no changes to the original plan (if you can call ""stand in a line in the open at shoot the enemy a plan).
on a brighter note, the plot was actually pretty decent for an action movie. The further divergence from the strict ""it is prophesy"" themes in the first half of the series was a welcome change. it was especially welcome that victory was not assured just because he is ""The One"". By the end of the movie I realized that several elements seemed to be heavily influenced by the Dune books (by Frank Herbert). Fans of that series may get additional enjoyment noticing parallels between the two.
all in all, the movie is worth admission but realize that it is just a continuation of the first two movies. Don't expect Reeves to suddenly learn how to act and don't expect anything earth shattering. Just go in to see how it all ends up.",1068336000,4,2135,4.533678756476684
1893638,5,B00009W2GQ,"Very good movie.  Very intense action, but like the first two installments the plot is paramount.  You can't take this movie at face value.  It requires thought and analysis - and if you are able to give it some thought, I think you will enjoy it.  I would also recommend checking out Reloaded within a day or so of going to see Revolutions.

Revolutions is Neo's continuing quest to figure out his purpose.  The basic plot starts out in two directions - first, the machines moving towards Zion attempting to destroy the remaining humans who are freed.  In addition, Agent Smith has made his way out of the Matrix into the ""real world"" in the form of Bane.  Neo has found that his powers exists outside of the Matrix and now Smith has done the same.  I equate Smith to a computer virus that continues to adapt.  Smith is Neo's dramatic foil and the Oracle tells Neo that he and Smith are ""negative twins"".

Break for the very long intense fight between the humans and machines.  Great battle scene (despite no Neo or Trinity).  Suspense builds as we wonder if Zion can hold off the machines long enough to get support from Niobe & Morpheous.

After the fight, Neo makes peace with the machines by telling the machines that Smith is a threat to the machine world just as he is the matrix (at this point, Smith has overtaken the matrix).  The machines then allow Neo to go into the Matrix and attempt to eliminate Smith - in the second film, Smith had adapted and was stronger (than he was in the first film) - unable to be destroyed by Neo.  The big question is how will Neo destroy Smith and what will the implications be.  The way Smith was finally destroyed was very profound.

Inside the Matrix, Smith overtook the Oracle, just as he had done to about everyone else inside the Matrix.  We even saw some foreshadowing here, Smith (sounding frustrated) asked the Oracle ""if you knew I was coming for you, why would you still be here"".  This was the Oracle's choice, and she knew that allowing Smith to overtake her would ultimately lead to his demise.  The oracle said to Neo earlier, ""Everything that has a beginning also has an end"".

Another cool fight scene between Neo and Smith.  Just as Neo was lying on the ground and nearly defeated, he finally realized how to defeat Smith.  This realization came about when Smith said (standing over Neo), ""I am now supposed to say - 'everything that has a beginning also has an end'"".  Neo then allowed Smith to overtake him, and then the machines pulled the plug that linked Neo into the Matrix.  By pulling the plug, the machines killed Neo and since Smith had overtaken Neo, this ultimately killed Smith.  Thus, Neo (major symbolism here - Neo is Christ-like) dies to save everyone else.  Smith dies and everyone inside the Matrix that Smith had overtaken turned back into themselves - hence the Oracle lying on the ground where Smith was slain.

A cut scene shows the matrix ""repairing"" itself.  The Oracle is sitting on a bench next to Seraph and the little girl (all of whom were earlier overtaken by Smith) and the architect tells the Oracle that she found a creative way to beat Smith.  The end.

Conclusion - The matrix still exists.  Big question - was the architect correct when he said at the end of Reloaded that Neo is an anomaly of the Matrix and that 5 others came before him and more will come after him?  The little girl (sorry, can't remember her name) asks the Oracle if they will see Neo again and the Oracle says ""I think so"".

All we know is that the Matrix still exists and that for now the freed humans and the machines are going to coexist.  Another question - will the machines continue to use humans for energy, or will those humans be freed - stay tuned...I think there is more to come.

There is a ton of Matrix philosophy on the this web site.  But it is limited to the first film.

1893639,4,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions has some of the best action. It is so much better than Reloaded, and about equal to the first Matrix. The scenes with Niobe flying the ship is hot, and the battle between the Machines and Humans is great. The final battle is awesome too, as well as trinity,morpheus, and Seraph in the club. You have to go see this movie, but you need to see the first 2 before watching this one.",1068336000,,402,4.302631578947368
1893640,4,B00009W2GQ,"I rewatched ""The Matrix"" before I watched ""The Matrix Reloaded"" on DVD, so that when I went to the theater and saw ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" I would have a fighting chance of being able to follow along and possibly appreciate the climax.  I would not say that the ending was predictable per se, but given the pair of problems afflicting Neo's world (the sentinels are coming to Zion City to kill all the humans while Smith is taking over every being in the Matrix) the solution has the virtue of logic (albeit Hollywood rather than cybernetic).  Anyway, I am not all that sure that thinking too much about this film is necessary for enjoying it, although I did take small pleasure in being ahead of Neo a couple of times in the film.  I do not thing there really could be any other ending, given the set up, but if you were expecting something spectacularly new and more substance than style in the conclusions of the trilogy, you are going to be disappointed.
""The Matrix Revolutions"" comes down to two gigantic battles.  The first is the defense of the dock in Zion City when the sentinels break through.  What we have at that point is basically the biggest shootout video game you have ever seen.  The second is the final showdown between Neo and Smith, which manages to combine the contradictory principles of bigger and better with less is more.  While each is going on you are two busy enjoying the spectacle to be overly concerned with what it all means in the end.  I mean, sometimes a EMP is a good thing and who cares if kicking a computer virus is really not going to do it much harm?
For me this was the biggest kitchen sink movie I have ever seen.  The whole ""Matrix"" idea got props for being cutting edge, but for the finale I was repeatedly struck by bits and pieces of dozens of other films and had to fight down an urge to yell, ""Use the Force, Neo!""  But there is a vessell fighting off attackers like ""Star Wars,"" big guns like in ""Aliens,"" millions of attacking creatures like in ""Star Ship Troopers,"" several scenes lifted from World War II movies, Neo fights Smith in a driving rain like the climax of ""The Seven Samurai,"" and dozens of other cinematic references.  This is not to say that these references are intentional homages, but neither are they intrusive (cf. ""The Rock"").
I was also struck by how ""The Matrix Revolutions"" has the same basic structure as ""The Return of the King,"" the upcoming conclusion of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" in that you have a giant pivotal battle (the Battle of the Pelinor Fields) and then the whole thing comes down to a mano e mano confrontation (Frodo and Gollum).  It also occurs to me with both of those movies and ""The Matrix Reloaded"" earlier this year, actor Hugo Weaving (Smith and Elrond), has the opportunity to be the first actor to ever appear in movies that came out in a single year that could end up earning $1 billion in the United States.  At the end of the first week of release of this film he has already broken the $400 million mark.",1068336000,,3012,4.474452554744525
1893641,5,B00009W2GQ,"I don't understand why some goofs are rushing to pan this film. Is it now cool to hate these movies? That must be the reason. It's not because this film is bad because it was great.
I loved this film: it's philosophy, the cinematography and the great action scenes. I went to see this movie with two other people, when it was over they both agreed that the movie was great and the critics are crazy!
The fight scene at the end was phenomenal, well worth the price of the ticket and the battle for Zion scene was exceptionally good. This film kicked major a$$!!
So why all the bad reviews? Who knows.. The Wachowski brothers have managed to turn The Matrix from a pure action film series into a credible work of science fiction, and I guess that made things too complicated for some people.
Anyway, follow the philosophy of the movie: think for yourself. if you want to go see the movie, then go see it.",1068336000,3,902,4.375
1893642,3,B00009W2GQ,"First up- The Original Matrix is my all time favourite. Second- When I first saw Reloaded, I was disappointed; it took 3-4 viewings to grasp it, then I enjoyed it. Third- I have only seen Revolutions once, I am sure it will take another two viewings at least to fully grasp it all.
Conclusion? I'm not 100% certain! And probably won't be until I have seen it more. The Original Matrix has always been five stars all the way, with the second definately good- But not great three stars.
The Third I think will fall into that good but not great slot. Perhaps it's simply an unfair case of the first film being SO good that they really were on a hiding to nothing with the sequels; the gut feeling maybe they should never have existed really comes to mind here.
To the point though, if you liked Reloaded you will like Revolutions, as it is really the second half of the four hour movie. The SFX are incredible-In this modern Cinema world of Jaw dropping effects it has been a long time since a movie has blown me away like that.
The main problems with it are the drawn out story around the main war; Matrix II & III really could have been pushed into a single movie...And in some places, where the main characters are missing from the action during the big fights, it kind of feels 'Independance Day'-like. Lots of cheesy dialogue and big effects.
Having said that, when it's good it's very good. I like the Philosophy aspect as most Matrix fans do, and I thought the plot was a good, fitting end to the series. I get the feeling a lot of critics have slagged it because (A) Those people like everything explained for them, without ambiguous 'discussion points', and (B) They wanted a Star Wars-ish happy ending with all our Heroes receiving medals on a stage. The Matrix was always too dark a story to do that.
Overall, it's a good movie which was never, EVER going to live up to the hype. But please, dear Brothers...Pay attention to the 'Tomb Raider' video games- Enough is enough, don't destroy the franchise by thrashing it.",1068336000,2,2026,4.478378378378379
1893643,4,B00009W2GQ,"In a nutshell, the best way to describe Revolutions is: Matrix 1, inverted! Just think of how and where the action was staged in The Matrix and flip it completely.
Just when you think that you have never seen a sci-fi fight scene this grandiose, the Wachowskis kick it up one very fat notch,(I'm not talking about the end-game sequence here either). There is more psycho-babble, every bit as vague/simple as Reloaded, but if I don't walk away from a sci-fi flick without feeling at least a bit dorky, then I'm just not getting my moneys worth!
Technology is used for no practical purpose, in needlessly dangerous ways, by people who say things to each other in convoluted parables which just makes it harder for Keanu, who is struggling to keep up anyway...and I guarantee you'll love every minute of it.
There are even parts where you just want to yell out to characters to (metaphysically) watch out behind themselves...and they never do. Great fun!
The most cynical criticism has been leveled at the conclusion of the film, but in yet another great sci-fi tradition, the end matters not one over-ripe fig. It's the ride we're along for here folks, and to knock the Matrix for trying too hard is like getting frustrated with a forest because of all the damn trees.
Matrix Revolutions, you'll cry, you'll laugh, (both in all the wrong places),but you'll still be talking about it long after the credits roll.",1068336000,,1409,4.755102040816326
1893644,3,B00009W2GQ,"One thing that stunned me about Revolutions, aside from the fact that it was actually engaging and pretty provocative, were the stereotypical portrayals of so many blacks as people who can't be bothered with grammar.  I found it pretty insulting.  But, with that out of the way, Revolutions actually provides pretty good entertainment.  Perhaps the weakest part of the movie is the dialogue; in fact, it's painfully bad.  Here's what the typical exchange sounds like:  ""I knew you were coming back.""  ""I know.""  ""Did you know I loved you?""  ""I knew you knew, but I didn't know that you would say that you knew.""  ""I know.""  It becomes downright impenetrable blather because of the writers' limited English skills.  There.  Someone needed to say that.
The acting is pretty good, but let's face it.  It's hard to act when you're given such mediocre lines.  And what happened to Laurence Fishburne?  He looks bloated, slow, and hesitant.  In fact, he seemed to be hung-over.  Thankfully, his presence in the film is quite limited.  Then there is the infatuation with leather and vinyl.  One might almost suspect a cross-dressing leather fetishist did the custume design, and no one could bring themselves to point out how silly it looks.  (I'm sure in a grungy metropolis just outside the hot core of the Earth sweaty leather will be the clothing material of choice.  Sure.  If not that, PVC vinyl.)
What is good about Revolutions is that actually starts saying something interesting about human nature, and the relationship of our own world to the matrix--pointing out, quite effectively, that our world isn't much more than or different from the matrix.  I won't go into much more detail about this thesis, other than to say that it makes for a much more subtle commentary on human relationships and emotions and provides a interesting philosophical bridge between humans and machines.  A lot of the movie is difficult to understand, but a least there is meat to chew on--unlike the pointless and silly Matrix Reloaded.
So, there you have it.  Not as good as the original (which didn't try to answer its questions and had a much more compelling and engaging premise), but much better than part two.",1068336000,,2197,4.888888888888889

The Wachowski Brothers KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING!!! (for those who are lost go and pick up a copy of THE MATRIX:REVISITED) What I have found is that most people were disappointed in this movie and RELOADED because they only were interested in THE MATRIX as just another simple action movie when these movies represent so much more
REVOLUTIONS end is as clearly oultlined and lead up to if you refer back to the first film(those fans of the ORIGINAL) Stop refering to these movies as seperate entities and view them as a whole picture(also view  THE ANIMATRIX--most of you probably hated that too) and then as Morpheus says ""FREE YOUR MIND""

Keanu Reeves, returns, of course, as Neo, The One and possible savior of Zion. Neo is in a coma, which, strangely, doesn't look like a coma because his brain patterns are different than a person in a coma, unfortunately. Laurence Fishburne, is, back as, Morpheus, the man with all the ideas. He believes in Neo, because of what he can do. Carrie-Anne Moss is, of course, back as, Trinity, who would give her life to save Neo. Neo is trapped between the machine world and the real world, unfortunately, by the Merovingian, played again, by Lambert Wilson. The Oracle, this time, played by Mary Alice, replacing the late Gloria Foster, is back, too. As is, Agent Smith, played, with sheer brilliance, by Hugo Weaving, who has never looked better in a performance like this, unfortunately. Niobe, played again, by Jada Pinkett Smith, is back, as well. This is also an appearance by the Architect, played again by, Helmut Bakaitis. The rest of the cast from ""The Matrix Reloaded"" returns as well, too. This is an brilliant movie with brilliant ideas and thoughts in its brain, a little more than ""The Matrix Reloaded"". It doesn't have that many fight scenes as its first two processors did, unfortunately, it is brilliant, nonetheless. The score by Don Davis, is a triumph in itself and it is one of the best scores heard this year so far. The directing by The Wachowski Brothers, is superb and dynamic, but it is also brilliant, too. The Costume Design by Kym Barrett is excellent. The Production Design by Owen Patterson is wonderful without compromise. The Cinematography by Bill Pope is superb. The Film Editing by Zach Staenberg is dynamic. The Screenplay, also by, the Wachowski Brothers, is excellent and superb, without compromise. The Visual Effects is brilliant as its first two processors, and it shapes the filmmaking of tomorrow's newest talents as ""The Matrix Reloaded"" did.

1893648,4,B00009W2GQ,"As with all sequels to blockbuster movies, people allow themselves to get caught up in the hype, and go into the film with unrealistically high expectations. To all those who have given this movie a one star rating, I feel sorry for you.
I saw Revolutions on Sunday afternoon, after months of eager anticipation. I tried to go into it with as little expectations as possible, and knowing as little as possible. It paid off. I was thrilled by the conclusions that the movie delivered. It wrapped it up cleanly, while doing the typical Hollywood thing, and leaving open the possibility of another movie.
Quite possibly the only movie that will top this experience will be The Return of the King.
Anyhoo, as most will know, Revolutions picks up at the precise point where Reloaded finished. Neo is trapped in a sort of limbo between the real world and the Matrix, unable to escape. From there, we are taken on a roller coaster ride (admittedly less mind-blowing than Revolutions' two predecessors) through to the finale of the human's battle against the invading sentinels, and Neo's final confrontation with the numerous Agent Smiths.
Through it all, the film does a great job of proving that despite the revelation that Neo is really just another part of the program that is the Matrix, he is still human and capable of experiencing all the strengths and frailties that makes us human.
And, in the end, it is that which will save Zion from extermination, rather than simply being able to piece together the riddles that the Oracle gives.
Revolutions is the perfect finish to the Matrix trilogy. It is not absolutely conclusive. If anyone went into the movie expecting that, then they were idiots. It does leave the door ajar for future projects.

Wow this was what I was hoping for, a big showdown. They were also realistic on how the machines and humans made peace, because there was no way that the small army of humans could have defeated the sentinel army. NONE WHAT SO EVER! So the first Matrix film introduced the characters and the situation, and the goal of the humans, the second one added more plot and more questions and was much more fast paced and allowed us to see samples of ""the one's"" power, and the third one gives us the biggest and coolest battle, possible in the hystory of cinema. I personally didn't think any of the matrix films were hard to follow or mentally stimulating, but I found them awesome!

There is an ongoing debate in my house about the ending, left 2 many things unanswered. If you look at the reviews on this board they pretty much mirror my household.
My Question to them is what did you expect? How would you have wanted it to end? How would you have crafted the ending. Or are all of you disappointed because this is the last in the sequel.
Story line was good, CGI incredible and the fight scenes were outstanding.

But to make an attempt at clarification, I will point out some things that I found significant.
Let's start at the beginning, since that would seem most reasonable. It starts out where it left off: Neo and Bane lying opposite each other on tables. Notice that they're wearing the exact same clothes and look like reflections of one another. Then, there is the scene with the train station. If you think about it, the train station is a kind of purgatory where you are transported one way or the other. Mobil Ave on the back wall is Latin for ""Hail Transportation."" While in this place, Neo reads like someone who is jacked in. The mind is the ultimate matrix and evidence of this is that they can't ""see"" Neo while he's in the Matrix.

1.  What's with Neo's child dialogues?  ""I have decided to bla bla bla..""  Trinity asks: ""why?"" ""Because I bla bla..""  ""What?""... And it goes on.  The brothers need to work on the scripts.
2.  In the Revolutions, Morpheus was a follower rather than a leader.  He had lost all his charisma that we were used to in the Matrix and Reloaded.  Moreover, I was expecting more romance between Naobi and Morpheus, maybe in place of the lousy dialogue about change.
3.  Is the senate abnormally calm or what!  Just like the machines.. Such an irony.
4.  Cool story line.  I liked how it all linked to one another in the end.  However the end was expected, specifically from the speech that Senate member gave to Neo about how humans needed the machines and the humans needed machines (Reloaded).

Although some probably wouldn't agree, I thought the end of this trilogy brought a somewhat satisfying closure to the story. It shows you the war Morpheus had been referring to and foreshadowing since waaaay back in the first movie, Morpheus described how devasting the war was becoming and now you have a chance to see just how intense and overwhelming it really is.  I give the action scenes an A+.
Although I'm not much for love stories, I know a good one when it comes along and the latter scenes focusing on Neo and Trinity is extremely heart-felt, very well done.  Everybody has their own theories on what the Matrix ""means"" and what it is implying POSSIBLY about our world, frankly I don't know WHAT it was trying to tell us.....but what I got out of the movie is that it had a lot to deal with fighting for what you deeply believe in at all costs, making unselfish sacrifices at the most opportune moment, and dying for your loved one/s without thinking twice.  Love, sacrifice and war are all timeless ideas that every human being can instinctively relate to, so who's to say this movie is a waste?, even if you are one who didn't discover the movie ending you had expected.",1068336000,4,1324,4.504166666666666

I had high expectations for this film as it was the final installment in a franchise that I am a big fan of, but this film did not deliver on anything the first two films worked so hard to set up. Nothing is answered, the dialogue is cheesy and horribly written and the story is horrendous. This film makes the three main characters we love  (Neo,Trinity and Morpheus) and makes them supporting characters in their own stories. How can such an iconic character as Morpheus, portrayed by the best actor in the series, Laurence Fishburne,have nothing to do in the biggest war of his life? Why did the Wachowskis expect audiences to care about second rate characters with third rate dialogue in the final installment of a trilogy? It was not the best time for new characters to develop, if that is what you want to call it. There is harldy any of the famous action sequences that made the first film an instant classic and saved the second installment from being mundane. Outside of Mary Alice as the oracle and Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, the performances were so wooden it made the performances in the last two Star Wars look Oscar-worthy. The film was boring, idiotic and a complete waste of time. This movie is a joke and so are the directors and producers for trying to make it sound like it was amazing. Don't see this film unless you like wasting money and time,because that is all the movie is.",1068336000,8,1497,4.5036764705882355
1893659,1,B00009W2GQ,"I won't be long.  I've ranted enough already.  This movie was terrible!  The Matrix has been an obsession of mine for the past couple of years, mostly because of the philosophical ideas presented and the cool kung-fu stunts.  This movie was a completely unsatisfying climax to two great, thought-provoking, and original films.  Let's see... about 2% of this movie deals with the ideas in the first two films... there are, maybe 3 scenes with the kung-fu we all know and love, one scene with bullet time and a climax that makes sense I guess, but did the Wachowski brothers really need two other movies to give us this??  I give it one star because there was a little, precious little, substance to this film and because I can't give it zero stars.  Don't waste your time, people.  Just read reviews with spoilers.  Believe me- you won't be missing much at all that you liked in the first two.",1068336000,7,892,4.594936708860759
1893660,3,B00009W2GQ,"The film served well as a straight-forward action flick, but in terms of philosophical ideas, it brings little to the table. The appeal of the first two matrix movies was the fun matrix talk it contained, clever dialogue and logical views on choice, freedom, etc. The first half of Revolutions was fine, giving us hints of the philosophical talk and an abundance of action. What disappointed most of us is the fact that this movie took place mostly in the real world, which is a lot less interesting than the matrix. Fans of the movies loved seeing the gravity-defying stunts in the matrix, but we only get glimpses of that here. the final battle between neo and smith was a huge disappointment, full of explosions and collisions, but we all know smith can't die via neo's fists, so what was the point of the whole fight. i can tell you that smith is defeated, though this should not come as a surprise to anyone, but the way he was defeated makes little sense. the wachowski brothers, faced with a genuine opportunity to make a truly great conclusion, just resorted to the final face off.
the best scene in the whole movie was not the 20 min battle to save zion, nor all of the endless action sequences, but rather the small quiet scene at the train station where neo exchanges words with a middle eastern family. the last stand of zion, though visually stunning, is an obligatory scene that does not add up at the end. you will see why. the ending itself was murky, leaving more questions than answers.
performances in the movie were generally solid, though keanu reeves might want to find another emotion than just the stunned look he struts around with. smith is an interesting character, but we get little of him. the chainsmoking oracle lacks the warmth of gloria foster and morpheus and trinity both contribute little to the movie. monica bellucci was a huge disappointment, uttering only one line the entire movie. The merovingian, who was interesting in the second movie, gets one little scene in this one, allowing him time to eat only one olive.
i am not looking forward to a sequel to this trilogy.",1068336000,,2110,4.659517426273458
1893661,5,B00009W2GQ,"Story: A Acting: B Direction: A Visuals: A+ Overall Grade: A
Okay, first of all, I loved the first Matrix. I couldn't wait for the next 2. BUT I did not see Reloaded in the theater because the critics and my friends told me it was terrible. I listened to them and ignored it all the way until last week when I reluctantly rented the DVD. Much to my bittersweet chagrin, I liked it. A lot. The action + special effects were awesome (in the true sense of the word), the story was fluid and the themes dealt with were relevant and intelligently handled (the major theme being free will vs. predestination and how love works out out within that apparently paradoxical framework). Excellently executed in a taut, thrilling, butt-kicking, name-taking rollercoaster ride of a movie. Good stuff.
First lesson learned: Movies are subjective. Everyone has different tastes. Your taste is not mine. I will never listen with absolute attention to a critic or my friends again. Of course, I will weigh their opinions and tack them on to my ""discretionary buffer zone"" before deciding to see a movie - but I will never make an absolute decision based on others opinions in matters of subjectivity again. Second lesson learned: Expectations suck. (Which is probably why the critics and my friends were let down with Reloaded)
Now, onto dealing with Revolutions...from my perspective:
After my unexpectedly pleasant encounter with Reloaded, I eagerly anticipated seeing Revolutions. This time around, critically speaking, the critics reviews were tougher and my friends expectations were once again shattered. They either *liked* it, mildly disliked it or hated it. All were disappointed by it. Hmmm...what was I to think? I learned my lesson after seeing Reloaded...this time around I was going to ignore them and go into it with no expectations. I decided to let the story take me where it was going instead of me having a preconceived idea as to where I 'expected' it to go. I just saw it. I LOVED it.
First lesson reinforced: Critics suck. I can't fully trust my friends' judgments ever again. Second lesson reinforced: Drop expectations (of a subjective nature of course...moral expectations are a different ball game). Sometimes when it comes to judging film, instead of letting the storytellers take us on a journey, we become the backseat drivers. We kick and scream, begging the driver to change his/her course because it's not where we wanted to go. I surmise that this could be the reason that most folks disliked Revolutions. They jumped into the car wanting to go somewhere else.
Now Revolutions was definitely a change of atmosphere and pacing in comparison to the previous two. In this movie, most of the story took place in either ZION or a spacecraft. The feel of this movie reminded me of ALIENS (Alien 2)...dark and at times creepily suspenseful. And unlike the first Matrix and Reloaded, the filling isn't comprised of mind-blowing special effect laced - reality-defying kung-fu action sequences. Instead, the action, however quantified, is INTENSE in a different way. Replacing the usually ever-present hand-to-hand combat is a craaazy techno-war between the humans and machines with an insane amount of bullets being fired. FUN. Furthermore, for the first time in this trilogy, I felt a genuine sense of fear. I actually feared for the lives of the characters faced with imminent death. The Wachowski's did a tremendous job portraying courage in times of absolute terror...which is a large part of the movie. And the ending...wow...now this is RIDICULOUSLY COOL. Neo and Agent Smith duke it out for the last time. I must say that this is the BEST fight scene depicted in the trilogy (again...in my opinion). I left the theater very satisfied.
For many, the depth of philosophical exploration in the Matrix series was not adequate enough. I disagree. Although I concede that I did leave the theater with some questions still unanswered (ontological in nature), the simple truths brought out by this series WERE more than enough for me. Revolutions was a terrific compliment to the previous two, ending the series brilliantly - tying together the loose strings Morpheus, Trinity and the people of Zion were anticipating. Simplicity is often very profound. Faith. Hope. Courage. Love. Hate. Life. Death. Choice. Fate. These are the concepts the Matrix tautly grappled with - and with boldness like no other film I have ever seen. Simple concepts...yet each with significant relation to our core existence.
Now, the movie did end kind of open-ended. We weren't really given complete answers to everything. Well...I hypothesize that the Wachowski bros. left our questions insufficiently answered for a purpose. Not that they want us to believe there is another movie coming that will seek to offer further explanation, but they want us to choose what we believe. Maybe they want us to take the journey Neo and the others took instead of telling us plainly. If all the questions were answered, we wouldn't have to think. Now that would be a shame. Hmmmm...could it be? It's possible. :)

1893662,1,B00009W2GQ,".....So I was one of those geeky people who bought their tickets for the first day, 2nd showing of Matrix Revolutions.  I had also done the same with the Reloaded sequel.  The 2nd film....I thought was actually horrible AND boring!  I wanted my $$ back, but most importantly, I wanted my 2+ hours back!!!  Same with this third installment.  Take ALL of the horrible cliches from EVERY war movie you've ever seen, and put it in this one!  The young kid, not really old enough to be in 'the army', the spouse who thinks their partner is dead, so sarifices themselves for the greater good, the 'hardened' old army guy who fights 'til his last breath.  UG!  The first 20 minutes of the film made me have hope that THIS sequel would finally redeem the entire series! BUT NO!  To top it all off...the ending isn't really an ending...please hope there isn't a 4th one!  A word of advice to people out there...pretend like this is the Highlander movie franchise...the first one is the REAL movie and the rest were just bad dreams!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE FIRST MATRIX FILM, don't get me wrong!!  PLEASE RENT IT WHEN IT COMES OUT ON DVD -- That way you can turn it off!!",1068249600,6,1161,4.450236966824645
1893663,5,B00009W2GQ,"First than anything, Matrix is a show. Just a show. You go to the cinema and watch it to have fun. It is not the Bible, it is not the Quram.
I went to see Matrix Revolutions almost in a forceful way (since i saw Reloaded, i had to see revolutions). I was very dissapointed with Reloaded, so i went with no hope.
However it was a nice surprise to see the characters becoming more human and real. Even the programs (the indian character, Smith, the Architect) show a lot of complex emotions and feelings, sometimes humorous, sometimes heart-touching.
Neo is no longer all powerful, and that brings life again to the movie, since you don't know what's going on next. That will keep you at the edge of your seat most of the time.
It was easy to recognize elements taken from many other sci fi movies (Aliens, Star Wars, even Dragon Ball and other Anime in general).
And the fun thing is that it makes you think. Not a lot, of course (this is a blockbuster movie), but it will keep going in your head for a while. It was worth to see Reloaded just to understand Revolutions (as it was worth to see the awful The Phantom Menace to understand the Attack of The Clones).
Should you watch this movie ?
If you saw Matrix 1, and you liked it, then you'll have a great time with Revolutions, since it closes many circles that opened in the first movie. If you didn't enjoy Matrix 1, there's no point in watching Revolutions (and don't even bother with Reloaded).",1068249600,49,1450,4.374074074074074
1893664,4,B00009W2GQ,"I found Matrix Reloaded to be thoroughly engrossing.  The feeling the movie generates (albeit a little heavy on the cliche war movie side) is so deep, so impactful, that I found myself dealing with the largest disappointment only upon leaving the theatre and realizing it was over.  The imagery of the movie is breathtaking, and while the acting is far from oscar material (Keanu, I love ya as Neo, but you could be out-acted by a inanimate carbon rod), it nevertheless pulls the movie through.  I especially liked the far more artistic and impactful manner the final neo-smith battle is executed in (I'm not ruining anything here... you KNEW they were going to fight) as ""wire-fu"" can only go so far before it plateaus on the excitement-meter.  While the movie does leave many questions unanswered, it ends the trilogy in an oddly satisfying and permanent manner.  I only hope that if there are ever any more matrix movies, they think hard about the idea before going forwards... the pure magic of this trilogy is a special thing, and I'd hate to see it go the way of batman (we ALL know what I'm talking about).
This movie, in my opinion, is utterly forgiven for its faults.  Watch it for the art, immerse yourself in the story... and enjoy what it has to offer.  It offers quite a lot.",1068249600,,1288,4.62280701754386
1893665,2,B00009W2GQ,"I will make it short and sweet, this movie absolutely sucked. I mean compared to the 1st movie which was awesome,and reloaded was fair,but this had no point ,no story and the ending,what the hell was that?",1068249600,3,205,4.5675675675675675
1893666,3,B00009W2GQ,"Now I have seen the entire trilogy, and I can successfully render my opinion of it- ""The Matrix"" did not need any sequels.  The trilogy doesn't exactly end with a whimper for ""Matrix Revolutions"", but let's just say I was not sad to see it end.  The film looks great, there are some terrificly tense scenes, and not too many loose threads are left hanging, but the thrill is leaving.  There's just not as much sense of awe anymore.  It's time to call it quits for ""The Matrix"" series.
There are some great things about ""Revolutions"".  The siege of Zion was one of the most impressive sights I've ever seen in a film.  The action throughout is very competently done.  Every frame of the screen is filled with detail, every texture is vividly rich.  There are some very tense moments, such as the aforementioned Zion battle and when Neo and Trinity take on the Machine City.  Seraph and Niobe are given some nicely extended roles.  Hugo Weaving is still terrific as Agent Smith.  And even the Oracle's replacement actress- Mary Alice for the late great Gloria Foster- is charismatic and mysterious.  These are all the things I liked about ""Revolutions"", and these moments hint at the just how great the first film was.
However, I couldn't help but be disappointed with it all.  One of the main problems was that I was honestly indifferent to almost everything- there's little emotional core to ""Revolutions"".  The supposedly emotional and sad moments are not handled well by the directors- they had just a slightly higher impact on me than George Lucas' dialogue in ""Attack of the Clones"".  This was not one of the movie's strong areas.  I was not a fan of ""The Matrix Reloaded"", but I cared more about what happened to the characters in that film than I do this one.
I mentioned in my review of ""Reloaded"" that I wanted to know more about the Merovingian and his role in the whole thing.  I take it back- he returns in this film, and this time he's downright irritating.  The Architect only has a cameo and we learn little else about him.  And those omnipresent Agents that were so sinister in the first film?  Sorry, they don't even show up this time outside of Smith.
And the ending?  Let's just say they could not have been less obvious in the symbolism- I almost giggled at some points.  Unfortunately, this doesn't really add to the emotional impact and sometimes makes the whole thing seem downright ridiculous.  Most things are resolved and explained (albeit in a contrived way), but just enough is left hanging to leave the door open for more sequels.
I honestly hope this does not happen.  With the coming of ""Revolutions"", it's becoming obvious that the Matrix's time is passing.  ""Revolutions"" will not send the franchise out on a high note, but at least it will save it from the doom of becoming boring and repetitive, which is what ""Matrix IV"" may do to it.",1068249600,2,2869,4.633663366336633
1893667,1,B00009W2GQ,"They may as well give that title to the fourth in the series - if they dare to make one.  Lets hope this is it folks, because what started out as an awesomely creative and original premise in the first film has degenerated into one of the most boring, pretentious, cliche-ridden, overhyped pieces of Hollywood trash that I have ever seen.  The final entry is nothing more than an emptyheaded plop in a sea of nonsensical McDonalds mysticism, mixed up with a lot of overlong battle scenes that are obviously nothing more than an attempt to titillate the enormous mass of ""gee-whiz"" folk who will marvel at any and all explosions, kicks, and what-have-you.  I had hoped that this film would be an improvement over Reloaded (that wouldn't have been hard to pull off), but they topped themselves and made a last-ditch cookie-cutter attempt to maximize profits and jump ship.  I don't blame the Oracle (Gloria Foster) for passing on to the next world after Reloaded - maybe she had enough real life clairvoyance to bail before they could snag her into making this third stinker.  A great shame since the first film was so genuinely brilliant.  Luckily, the first film stands on its own - as it always will on my shelf!  Adios Wachowski brothers (lets hope!)",1068249600,4,1252,4.715596330275229
1893668,2,B00009W2GQ,"Came to the theatre today looking for more philosophical brain food for thought (similar to the Oracle and the Architect's dialogue in ""Reloaded"") than what delivered. Instead all the dialogue was just drivel, and many of the main characters (Morpheus in particular) were marginalized. The wagering between Morpheus/Trinity and the Merovingian created some excellent tension - which was negated, then forgotten.  E.g. his request to ""bring me the eyes of the Oracle"" as he toys with 2 martini olives on a toothpick. Makes you shudder, eh? And the subway-station limbo world was an intriguing setting that I hoped they would explore more; instead the Oracle wager is quickly abandoned and Neo is whisked away.
So, instead of true substance, the movie was overwhelmed with clich and useless feely-good subplots. We have the overzealous (dare I say obnoxious) 16-year old who wants to fight in the war and somehow manages to outlast all the seasoned war generals. The Indian family that wanted to save their young daughter seemed an artificial ploy to extract some sympathy from the audience. And I wanted to bang my head against the wall during Trinity's long spiel to Neo, where all the old Hollywood ""I love you"" clichs are recycled.
The final fight between Smith and Neo in the rain seemed the high point of the movie - visually stunning and on par with the visuals of the prior films. But again, soo much potential that quickly plummets. It seemed the writers caught themselves in a bind here - both Smith and Neo have already proven that they are indestructible while in the matrix and thus cannot destroy each other physically. Then Smith seems to be hovering on the verge of existential crisis (lack of purpose) and I thought this would be cool, having his downfall rooted in the existential, rather than the physical realm. But no, we just get a series of inexplicable, blinding-white explosions. In the final scene we have characters I could care less about making cryptic comments and flinging the Sequel door wide open. So what, now there is peace? I.e. no more conflict between the machine world and humans, each just coexists? Do the machines continue to use embryonic humans to fuel their existence and the ""awakened"" humans are still relegated to their (now destroyed) underground lair? Seems to me the humans still get the short end of the stick...",1068249600,,2362,4.919799498746867
1893669,3,B00009W2GQ,"For one thing, see this movie now while it is in theatres. I am pretty sure all the mind-numbing action will not have half the effect when played off a DVD. For another, no point reading too many of the partisan reviews, The Matrix franchise never had the unanimous universal appeal badge after its first film.
But since this is a review, I need to offer my personal take.
The first Matrix, a fab concept executed with unprecedented  pizzazz, was a colossal hit because of its novel concept -- it let your mind ponder the extent of the concept. ""Reloaded"" dug into the story and complicated things further, which was a mixed bag as far as I am concerned, but still left me anticipating an ending I was sure would blow me away.
Having seen this third installment, I just feel gyped. I guess anyone who anxiously awaited this release will know exactly what I mean. It's almost like the Wachowskis sat down to review the first two movies and said, ""Hey, too much character development and story. Now let's get down to the nitty gritty, and start shooting"". There's more bazooka-toting characters here than you'd find in a crude Japanese anime, and the whole ambience is very hasty as if time was running out to rake in the dollars from the movie making.
So, personally, I am a bit disappointed and seek consolation in the knowledge that when the DVDs do become available as a Criterion trilogy or something, the first movie alone will carry the entire Matrix family.
Nevertheless, if you manage your expectations, this third part makes for some fast-action weekend popcorn if that's your thing.",1068249600,,1591,4.702508960573477
1893670,5,B00009W2GQ,"This last installment of the matrix trilogy is nothing short of pure genius and shows why this trilogy is one of the most powerful epics of the modern age. It is without a doubt one of the most intelligently written and wonderfully acted films. The jaw dropping visual effects and adrenaline charged battle scenes are way beyond anything seen in the first two films. Awesome war scenes,an incredible soundtrack and legendary fight scenes is what this movie brings. Not to mention that the movie is extremely thought provoking because it beautifully expresses our hopes,dreams,fears and other ideas such as life and death. The movie has gotten alot of unfair criticism by ignorant reviewers who are making petty complaints. The main complaints are that the acting wasn't good,not enough fight scenes in the matrix and no final resolution in the movie. First,the acting may not have been superb,but it was good enough. Secondly,people need to get over this complaint because there were enough fight scenes in the matrix done in the previous movies and this was not the main premise of revolutions. Thirdly,were people actually expecting a complete and final victory?Outright victories never happen in real wars because there are too many other variables to take into account such as death and other lingering issues. Christ came to save us and create a new utopian world,but yet we are still enslaved by our natures and the world has become more of a hell than its ever been. Where was the final resolution in his coming?To conclude,alot of people simply did not understand the plot,let alone the philosophy behind it. There is a cultural backlash against this movie because it is being well received by the general public. I suspect that people just had too many expectations for this movie and spent all of their time looking for its faults.

Never before had I seen such an intriguing plot, great characters and most importantly, mind-numbin' gun-totin' special effects.
After this, I was first in line to see the sequel and I thought ""hey, that was pretty good! Not as great as the first, and on its own, probably woulda been crappy... but all the questions raised, all the odd ends, they're all gonna be tied up with just as much special effects to boot in Revoltions! WOOT, MATRIX!"" after seeing the conclusion, I can only hope for a fourth movie, cos everything that has a beggining, has an end... and this was not it.
In exchange for peace, Neo would kill Smith so he could not ruin the machene city as he did the matrix. But to do this, Neo gave his own life. And the machenes retreated. WHY?! That big ol pointy machene made a deal with Neo, but after he has killed Smith, why not just carry on with the attack THAT THEY WERE WINNING and ""kill 2 birds with one stone""? Surely these machenes would have no concept of honour, and could break any promise without regret, something the machenes don't have? And another thing, how is peace possible anyway? As the machenes need the humans in the pods to live, and the Zion humans want to free them, it is not.
Really, a predictable ending of the complete destruction of the evil machenes and freedom for the enslaved human race would have been nice. Hell, I would've been happy with the machenes winning, killing the humans in Zion and having all the humans in power pods they needed to survive, with the possibility of the One being reborn, AGAIN, to save the human race in the future. But thats just it, there is no ending. Neo and Trinity die, so does Smith, and the machenes give up their attack on Zion, so we are basicly back where we started! Or are we? Have the humans been freed from their pods? It doesnt say! For absolute freedom, are the people of Zion still going to have to free them? In that case, the ending makes even less sense!
All in all, its a great trilogy, and some of the greatest movies of all time, but it is all ruined by this third installment. The movie deserves an ending. We, the fans, deserve some explinations.

They should have never decided to make it a trilogy, but instead the Wachowski brothers were money-hungry and wanted to ruin a piece of art. THE ENDING WAS HORRIBLE! The first Matrix was a great movie with a great concept. I then saw the Animatrix. If you consider yourself a Matrix fan, and you haven't seen the Animatrix, see it today. The Animatrix brought a whole new world to my eyes. I could just imagine the ending that was supposed to be. People are dependent on machines and machines are dependent on people. The Matrix Revolutions didn't tackle the question of all the humans getting released from the matrix itself. All of a sudden, the goal of mankind changed from releasing every single human from the matrix, into saving Zion. I would've liked to see a ending where nothing existed and everything died. Face it, the earth is ruined and both humans and machines need each other. I would've liked to see every single human wake up and not start a revolution but die. Having them die would mean that all the machines would also die. Neo should've had a chance to wake up every single human but decide not to. Humans cannot exist outside the matrix anymore. Humans might exist in total control within the Matrix, but this is the only way man can survive. Zion then would be destroyed. Yes, it should be destroyed. The cycle of ""the one"" would continue and a new Zion would be created. The lesson of the story would be the following: Mankind can no longer exist without the machines. There is no hope for the mankind to ever escape from the matrix. People could no longer exist outside the matrix. The earth's atmosphere is ruined and there is no food left. The Matrix is home. Man does not know of any other world or home outside the matrix. People need the machines to exist. The machines need people to exist as well, creating a perfect balance. This is the only way. If you saw the Animatrix, you would agree. I would have like to see a solid ending, but instead I was fed a heap load of crap. The ending was left up to interpretation, but it didn't even seemed thought out. Some might argue that the ending of the movie meant all humans were released. If you would've paid attention to this movie and last you would understand that you are wrong. The architect said he'd release those that don't want to be in the matrix. Only 1% of the population don't accept, so only 1% are being released. What kind of revolution is that. I would have liked to see mankind realize they lost, even the movie metion absolutely anything about the releasing of mankind, but it didn't. The last two movies were flawed and were loaded with unnecessary story elements. The movies had some cool action scenes but never answered ""why"" or ""how"". How did Neo gain powers in the real world? Why did Neo get trapped in a world between the matrix and the real world? There are many question like this I have, but the movie never answers them. Overall, I was very dissapointed, and I recommend you see the Animatrix if you have questions about the making of the Matrix itself.",1068249600,3,3176,4.515625
1893674,4,B00009W2GQ,"I can't really say I found the Matrix Revolutions to be totally disapointing. It had tons of action eventhough most of it took place in the real world with man verse machines. I would've liked more kun-fu and more action in the matrix but the action we get is still loud and exciting. After seeing the first one and hearing that sequels were gonna be made I was excited. I expected new villains and different plots but we don't really get that. The trilogy is just one movie with the same plot.
  I would've liked to have seen Neo fight a new main villain in the sequels but instead we get Agent Smith again. Not just one but a whole lot of him. I admit that's entertaining because Hugo Weaving is great in the role. It's not much that can be done with the same villain over and over again though. Neo and Agent Smith's fight should've ended in the first one, was not really a need for him to come back. None of the Neo/Agent Smith fights are even as good as their battle at the end of the first one.

  It's still not bad though, it looks great and the special effects are awesome. The Wocohwski's direction is well done. They throw a lot of action at you all at once during the battle for Zion scene but you always know what's going on. If it was badly directed you would be lost in a scene like that. They made an intense and exciting movie, we don't get an entirely satisfying ending but it's not really a bad ending. It does make you want to know what happens next though even if there isn't really a need for a part 4. The ending just makes you confused and mad about some of the fates of the characters. The first was a fun cyber-punk/sci-fi/thriller and the second is slow but when it's not it has some really fun action scenes. Revolutions is darker, more violent and not as much fun as the first too.

That's why I was extemely disappointed as a fan and as an aspiring screenwriter to watch the Wachowski brother's writing weaken with the last two films. It seems they beleive that FX will take the place of thier writing. The reloaded FX were way too much. They could have been done in moderation. In the first film you said ""Holy crap!"" In the second film, ""we've seen this stuff already"". If they were to have done about four key scenes with new and exciting FX my response would have been the same, instead they relied on slowing things down in places where it wasn't needed. And why is it that if Neo is the only one to move like the agents that the scene at the beginning of Reloaded is using bullet time. Trinity can't move that fast, only the agents can. The Wachowskis must have had an extra mil. to throw around and use up running time. I'm not an authority here, i'm not forming thier philosophy for them, you make it whatever you want, but it appears to me that the Wachowskis got lost in thier own film and what thier own characters abilities are. In the third film I was dissapointed. You don't set up an amazing concept like the first film and then totally blow it off atthe end like they did. There was no resolution, no closureand who really won?! I would have thought the human race would prosper, but that the battle would be bigger, but then again there are alot of machines. After all Neo's discoveries about himself and the system, the Wachowski's decided to ""tie"" the game, as it were, at the end of the film. It seems to me that the Wachowskis' lost faith in thier own savior, in thier own hero. I don't know if Revolutions could have been written more solid or not. All i know is that the script was full of holes that the Wachowskis decided to not even press upon or even try to resolve. For instance, the scene in Revolutions where half of Neo is stuck in, what appears to be a ""forbidden zone"" of the matrix waiting for the ""train man"" to smuggle him back in, AND then his body's in a coma, but he was already unplugged at the end of the second matrix, so what is this??? Did part of his soul jump into the matrix without being jacked in?? How?? And what's with the ""Final Fantasy"" anime stuff? And in another scene where Neo and Trinity take Niobe's ship and head to the outskirts of the city; Neo can see things in an orange light, a ""squiddy"" comes at the ship, passes over, but the essence of the sentinel passes through his body? What was that?... The Wachowskis have clearly gotten confused somewhere along the lines about things they wanted to do, because some of this stuff didn't make any sense. It seems like they had extra money in thier budget. That's my piece, folks. All in all I'm disappointed by this, maybe I'm not that smart and all the answers are there somewhere. As Neo once said: ""Where you go from here...is up to you...""",1068249600,,3231,4.342148760330579

I think all three movies together create a profoundly deep, entertaining, and exciting story that will be entertaining people for hundreds of years.  Revolutions was no exception.

I mean really, what was the last good trilogy or even sequel you've seen?  Charlie's Angels 2?  The 'Friday' series?  102 Dalmations?  Get real...  The Matrix: Revolutions solidifies the 'Matrix' franchise's status as one of the great trilogies in moviemaking/storytelling history.  True Matrix fans, while undoubtedly dizzy from following the jump from the original to 'Reloaded', appreciate the movies for what they were - MOVIES.  Movies that made you think, long after you left the theater, coupled with groundbreaking special effects and intricate fighting sequences.  Everyone from kids to college professors have theorized on the possible paths this final chapter may take to draw this series to a close - many people didn't even know who the real Merovingians were, now they are drawing up all sorts of hypotheses and synopses.  If nothing else, 'Reloaded' taught us to always carry a thesaurus.
For those of you who never even liked the original -WHY ARE YOU WATCHING THEM?  What are you expecting to see - VeggieTales?  And for those of you who did like the first 'Matrix', but not the sequels... I ask that you check your own expectations of the films prior to seeing them.  If you're like the majority of us (movie audiences), you had them set way too high.  This is definately not a movie I'd recommend watching if you haven't followed the entire series, since in essence it's telling one grand story.  This is to include the 'Animatrix' short films, as well as the 'Enter the Matrix' video game which took place during 'Reloaded'.
Breathe...
Okay.  The Matrix: Revolutions.
The movie (which was filmed simultaneously with 'Reloaded') picks up exactly where we left off in part 2: the machines are advancing rapidly towards the last human city - Zion - and the citizens are bracing themselves for what lies ahead.  Neo is still in limbo, torn between the 'real world' and the Matrix, and Agent Smith is spreading like wildfire throughout the Matrix.  He has also cleverly managed to take over the body of a Zion soldier (Bane), and proceeded to sabotage his ship's role in the preliminary military offensive... resulting in the rest of the crews being slaughtered by the sentinel machines.  Neo, as well as his fellow shipmates Morpheus and Trinity, also have to come to grips with the fact that the entire prophesy concerning 'The One' may have been a lie - that it was another layer of control used by the machines over humans.  Zion itself had been destroyed 5 times prior to this current threat, consequently there have been 5 prior 'Ones'.
In the third installment, Neo has completely gone from a computer-hacker gone vigilante superhero, to a Christ-like messiah for humanity, even being referred to as 'Savior'.  (In one scene taking place in the real world, he walks towards the machine city - the light images shown resemble that of a man walking on water.  Hmmmmm....  with that in mind, Neo's fate was pretty easy to guess long before the release of this movie.)  He finally comes to terms with what it is he must do in order to have any meaningful impact on this war and to save mankind.  Trinity, after showing much heart and determination in rescuing the love of her life from his torn state, goes along with him to the Machine City.  Along the way they do battle with Bane (Agent Smith), and our hero is blinded. (His response: ""Trinity, you're gonna have to drive."")  That's pretty much all you see of Neo and Trinity until Neo's climactic showdown with Agent Smith at the end...  a huge chunk of the movie passes by and they are nowhere to be found on the screen.  This is probably the one aspect that I felt should've been done better, as their story (aside from Neo being the main focal point of the entire series) of love together added the only real 'human emotional touch'.
The majority of the film takes place in the 'real world'... not the Matrix, where all of the cool fighting usually takes place.  The city is buckling down and getting ready for the impending attack from the machines.  (The expanded roles of Zee, Niobe and others from the 2nd film was welcome.)  The sentinel attack on the city is nothing short of phenomenal, a seamless fusion of real-life and CGI action that lasts for a good while, but doesn't seem to just linger on like the shorter but less-effective Neo vs. Smith clones fight marathon in 'Reloaded'.
Meanwhile, back in the Matrix, Agent Smith is growing stronger by the second, and is threatening to completely destroy the computer-generated world altogether.  The final fight sequence between he and Neo is exceptional, if not familiar.  Smith is MUCH stronger than before, and even shares Neo's ability to fly.  The majority of this anticipated showdown takes place in the air. (kinda corny, if you ask me... but effective anyway.)
In the end, we are teased with the possibility that this may not be the last we see/hear of The One.  Seemingly taking the most simplistic route for drawing things to a conclusion, the 'W' Brothers may have upset some followers.  In a way, I find it fitting that so many people spent so much time/energy hypothesizing what would take place next and how it would all end - with all kinds of finely-detailed theories and philosophical overtones, when in the end it may have been the easiest route that everyone had in the back of their minds all along.
In the end, I give this entire series a A-.

1893678,4,B00009W2GQ,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Matrix head (I saw the second movie on Wednesday at 10 PM and the third on Wednesday at 7 PM).  That said, my reviewed might be a bit skewed, but several other obsessive Matrix types gave this movie poor reviews.
I have few gripes about this film.  First, the big action sequence is completely CGI.  It's darn good CGI, but one of the joys of the first film was the knowledge that everything happening was real.  Second, Neo and Trinity get lost in the rest of the plotline.  After about 30 minutes of the big action sequence, I started to wonder what had happened to Neo and Trinity.
Now, it's time for my rant about the good aspects of the film.  When I walked into the film, I had read the reviews already and was preparing my spiel for when I walked out of the theater.  ""The Wachowski Brothers have really lost their reputations as good filmmakers,"" I was writing down in my head.  However, about halfway through the film I decided, ""This is actually really good!""  The Wachowski Brothers added just the right amout of humor to show that the movie isn't taking itself too seriously, especially involving the Kid.  The Kid is that guy who's obsessed with Neo because Neo saved him.  If you're all confused, there's a short in the Animatrix about him.  The Animatrix is probably worth renting just to see the killer CGI in Final Flight of the Osiris, but don't buy it.  Wow, I've really gotten off-track.  The plot actually provides good closure to the trilogy--don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  The plot also doesn't get lost in the philosophical dilologue like in the second film (for the record, though, I prefer the second film over the first).  The acting isn't too bad, either.  I know that Keanu Reeves is criticized for his wooden acting, but that type of acting actually fits the character quite well.  Hugo Weaving and the guy who play Bane also make up for the actors in the key roles.  We all know Hugo Weaving, but we don't know Bane well, yet.  Bane, if you weren't paying attention during the second movie (or if you haven't watched it four times, like I have), was taken over by Agent Smith.  Anyway, the guy who plays Bane absolutely NAILS the Agent Smith inflections.
I think that I'm going to close with what my friend said after reading the reviews for this movie.  ""They say that the plot's bad, but it's the same plot.  And they complain about the acting, but it's the same actors.""",1068249600,33,2454,4.502262443438914
1893679,5,B00009W2GQ,"People, this movie is not about the battle scenes!!  That's like saying Titanic is a movie about an iceberg!!  If you don't like this movie, you perhaps need to go back to the theater by yourself and watch it again.  By far the greatest genius of this movie (and of course the two before) is that it becomes personal to the viewer.  You want an action flick?  Fine.  The Bible re-loaded?  Philosophy 101?  It's all there.  Of course, the critics who write drivel about the movie have only seen it once, after a lot of free booze from the PR people. Let's face it, this movie and the two before it will be the ones you watch over and over again for many years to come.  So few movies ever made will earn that right.
To those who see God in the Architect and the Devil in the Oracle, I say look again:  If the Architect is God, then the Oracle is certainly the Divine Feminine, Mother Earth, human intuition, God as a ""She"".  They are the yin and yang it took to create humanity.  And by Revolutions, the Merovingian is looking very devilish to me.  Smith could be the devil (all evil) or he could just be the all-encompassing power of ego, ""me, me, me,"" which destroys the altruistic purpose of the Messiah.  Neo must put all personal interests aside (destroy his ego) to save Zion.
If the Architect is God, then why does he also come across as Karl Marx, the architect of socialism, so hell-bent on decrying human choice, hope and love?  If the Architect is Marx, and the Matrix is Marxism, is the Oracle human nature? Besides, if Neo is Christ, he is way too sassy with God, but calmly puts Marx in his place.
As for Neo, I am continually perplexed by why Hollywood overlooks the acting skill of Keanu Reeves.  He wears sunglasses in a lot of scenes and still shows more burning emotion and bottled up rage than anyone else acting today. Without using his eyes, or screaming profanity.  Think about it.
Stand-out scenes include Trinity and the Merovingian, Trinity and Neo, and Smith with the Oracle.  I don't want to give any plot away.
Here's why Revolutions will not win any Oscars or good reviews:  Critics and ""the academy"" are universally left-wing secularists, Mel Gibson aside.  There is religion, even Christ in this movie.  Some critics got far enough in Sunday school to actually pick up on that.  You can tell by how their reviews of the movie debate how realistic or original the battle scenes are.  People, this movie is not about the battle scenes!!  But a movie with Christ in it will never receive a good review or an Oscar from anyone hoping to work again in Hollywood.  Also, since there are no dysfunctional families in the film, no Oscars will be forthcoming.  That is the only way to win an Oscar.

But the beginning was interesting, the oracles body guard does some helpful action, and Smith loses his mind altogether...
It didn't really feel like a Matrix film to me, but I guess everyone will see it differently. I got the point after the ending, but they didn't have to go about it the way they did.",1068249600,3,791,4.462068965517242

As stated above, ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is an exhilarating conclusion to this brilliant, seminal and cinematically beautiful intelligent series!  Few cinematic trilogies can even compare to the experience that is ""The Matrix Revolutions"" and its two predecessors in its breadth of entertainment on all levels, whether one is talking about its action sequences or the extraordinarily intelligent script that is epic in its nature and scope.
All involved, from the series creators the Wachowski brothers to every actor and actress in the film deserve such high praise for their efforts in creating these exceptional films.  From the trials and tribulations in their training for the high speed karate moves to Carrie-Ann Moss even breaking her leg, all of their efforts shine through brilliantly on the silver screen.  As was the case with the first two films, the score for ""The Matrix Revolutions"" seamlessly enhances every scene in the film and what I found to be a move of genius, the movies creators didn't just extend what they used in ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" but they used what seamed to be an all new score for this film.
The Premise:
As ""The Matrix Reloaded"" concluded we learned that Neo's seemingly super powers no longer ended when he left the Matrix but he is now in a coma.  The sentinels are continuing to bore down on Zion and Morpheus and Trinity learn that Neo, while not being plugged into the Matrix, is actually in the Matrix, but not where they might expect him to be...
What follows from there is nothing short of one of the most intelligently written and wonderfully acted films where the action sequence with the sentinels getting into Zion in an epic battle and Neo and Trinity's efforts to reach the machine capital will have you, the lucky moviegoer, on the edge of your seat the whole way, hoping and praying that everybody will make it.
I highly recommend not only ""The Matrix Revolutions"" but the entire extraordinary series as you will soon find yourself compelled to ""enter the Matrix...""  {ssintrepid}",1068249600,9,2052,4.953488372093023
1893682,4,B00009W2GQ,"You know, it amazes me, judging from the many negative reviews on here, how people don't seem to want to watch a movie with an open mind.  Granted, movies are suppose to be entertaining and relieve some stress, but who says it can't do that and make you think at the same time?  Movies like that are ones you never get tired of.  Just look at Lord of the Rings.
Matrix Revolutions ended the trilogy wonderfully.  Not only where there awesome battle sequences and cool visuals(in particular, Machine City), but it really went out to prove the points the Wachowski brothers wanted to make through their Christian/Judaism/Hinduism theologies.  It wasn't all perfect, but it explained the theme of all having a purpose in life itself and how much we use our gifts to see to that purpose and find out truth very well.  And isn't that something we'd all like to do?  You may not think that in every-day life, but deep down, I know that's something we all want to know.
The acting was decent enough for our three main heroes, but Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith stole it for me.  He is probably the greatest sci-fi/action villain to come out in the 21st century.  And his final battle with Neo was simply breathtaking.  Reeves portrayed Neo good too, constantly pondering where his place is in this war and how it's going to end.  Overall, the acting wasn't that bad that a lot of critics seemed to bash in their reviews, although I do admit a little more emotion needed to be shown in some people.  I mean, there are thousands of Sentinels about to kill them, wouldn't you be scared to death?
My gripes were little but kept it from being a perfect score.  First off, Morpheus did absolutely nothing in this movie.  OK, you can count him being a co-pilot, but what does that do for him?  Seemed like a big downfall for the man who helped find the One.  I already stated that some actors could show a little more emotion and there were a couple of loose plotlines that never really were cleared up, mostly dealing with the Frenchman and the Architect.  But from the way they ended the movie, it could be something the Wachowskis could deal with in the future.  Hmmm....
All in all, Revolutions was probably the 2nd best of the trilogy.  Better than Reloaded, but not the original.  That should be an obvious considering how innovative the first movie was at the time.  But it's a solid flick that really got unfair reviews.  Open your mind to the Matrix movies and try not to think every sci-fi flick has to have nothing but action.  It is indeed a good action flick, but it's also about seeking your purpose in life and how to make the most of it, something myself, being a Christian, try to seek and carry out every day of my life in order to reach the ""truth"".  That's just from my perspective so take this review anyway you want it.  I just know this movie made my thumbs go up.",1068163200,11,2869,4.460652591170826
1893683,3,B00009W2GQ,"If Revolutions isn't what you expected, perhaps its time time to scale down your expectations. The film returns to its roots, sort of, by refocusing on the struggle between Zion and the machine world and Neo's role in bringing down The Matrix. Not everything is what it seems, though, in this complex, loud action thriller.
When we last saw Neo he was in a coma. Some of his abilities from the Matrix had intruded upon the real world. As a result, he was able to stop the squids from killing him and his crewmates. Evidently he's stuck between the machine world and the human one. He's stranded in a program that manifests itself as a subway station. His only way out is to get on the train that runs through it but the trainmaster is in the employ of the evil French character from the second film. That's not going to happen without some intervention from Trinity and Morpheus (which does eventually occur though to say how would spoil it).
Agent Smith has occupied the body of a human survivor of an attack by the Matrix. He's now able to battle Neo in the real world. He's also multipling in the Matrix taking over programs without end and reshaping the Matrix's interactive human landscape in the process.
The main weak point of the film is dividing up the trio of characters at the heart of the film; Trinity and Neo end up on a journey to Machine city where the ultimate confrontation may or may not occur. While Morpheus is shunted to the side as he tries to get back in time to help save Zion. The performances are, as usual, stellar. The point of the Matrix films, though, isn't the acting as much as the visuals, stunts and psuedo intellectual discusses the characters have. So it's a good thing that the Wachowski brothers have four (including Hugo Weaving in his marvelous performance as Agent Smith)strong actors in the lead roles.
The visuals are much more convincing here than in Reloaded. Although the sequence on the freeway in Reloaded was great looking, there were many substandard effects shots in that film. While there are times (such as a few of the scenes during the assualt on Zion City)the CGI effects aren't completely convincing, that's not too great a sin; consider what they would have looked like with matte paintings, miniatures and stop motion models by comparison.
The film isn't quite the classic that the first Matrix was but is an improvement over Reloaded. Revolutions manages is closer to the spirit of the first film in many respects and the parts of the film that echo the quality of the first film are the strongest as well. The conclusion is both bold and idiotic. I was really surprised by the choices the Wachowski brothers made. I said idiotic because they aren't the most commerical and that's a credit to them; they felt that the story had gone as far as it could go.
This film, like Reloaded, is about twenty minutes too long. It seems that the Wachowski's and their editor felt it was necessary to give as much screen time as possible to the battle in Zion City because of all the expensive CGI effects (or perhaps they just didn't know how to cut the sequence). Revolutions meanders just a bit but is still enjoyable entertainment. If you're expecting enlightenment, you'll be sadly disappointed as not all the ""answers"" are provided. It's just as well as Revolutions had the potential to spiral out of control into a mess (much like Lucas' latest Star Wars installments).
Revolutions is an action packed film with many surprises. If you give it a chance, you'll enjoy the film. While it runs about twenty minutes too long, it's not a bad way to spend a Saturday night.",1068163200,4,3621,4.641744548286605
1893684,5,B00009W2GQ,"I am guessing that most viewers consider the Matrix trilogy to be a highly symbolic, religiously-themed set of movies.  They are correct, but not for the surface reasons that most will think -- instead, the films are the most anti-religious movies ever made.

Consider this:  Who has ultimate ""control"" of the universe? God, of course.  Who is supposed to be his foil? Lucifer, of course, but only by his choice.

But the Matrix says quite bluntly that God (the architect) and Lucifer (the oracle) not only are not enemies, they work in tandem to keep the universe (matrix) running as smoothly as possible.

Indeed, they have ""rebooted"" the universe multiple times...remember, Zion has fallen five previous times.  It is as if the ""big two"" have an on-going bet regarding the outcome.

Neo (Christ) is simply the unwitting tool of these two central figures.  The oracle ""plays a dangerous game"" in that she takes a mighty risk -- a risk that Agent Smith (the anti-christ) might destroy the matrix (the universe) if left unchecked.  She willfully generates a christ-figure (Neo), betting that he will overcome the threat through sacrifice, love and ""peace"" ... but not before extracting a concession from the architect -- that some (but certainly not all or most) of the lesser programs/people can actually gain their freedom if her christ-tool prevails.  You can argue that a by-product of her duel with the architect was freedom for a few (and continued misery for millions).

The final scene shows the new, squeaky clean Matrix -- a rebooted Matrix.  But for whom?  Who stays? Who goes?

Summary: The story as told is compelling and depressing, but a more shocking ""Revolution"" would have been for the oppressed to have turned against the oracle and the architect...and to have smashed their wicked game.  Man's freedom was not God's design -- it was a concession extracted by force.  The battle is not over.

Appendix to original review

Many of the 1-star reviewers seem to think that Neo, Morpheus, Trinity...et al...are real people who battle machines.  They are not.  They are programs.  Everything is a program.

The Matrix takes place entirely in ... the matrix.  One hint is when Neo can uses his powers outside what the viewer thinks is the matrix.  No, he is not channeling the Source -- it is a hint to the viewer that it is ALL matrix -- multi-layered.

Another hint is when Smith can send himself via the ""wet-ware"" of Agent Bane.  Again, this would be impossible in a physcial universe -- it is a hint that everything is a program and that the real world is a layer of matrix.

Didn't the Oracle tell you that in Reloaded -- that everything has a program to control it?  And that programs that are not needed get deleted?

Neo is a program.  He was written to become the One and deliver the reboot of the prime program.  He has very little choice about that.

The Merovingian was clear -- choice is an illusion.  Neo is all cause and efect, not choice. Ah, but the controllers of the matrix (the Architect and the Oracle) are not all-knowing.  They are not omniscient.  There can still be UNINTENDED consequences.  Not all lipstick ends up on your face :)

The machines (in Machine City)...ironically...are also captives in the matrix.  You think the ruling elites would not be able to quickly find a way to enslave the MACHINE masses, do you?  The Architect told you that the matrix is older than anyone realizes.  The matrix controls the machines -- the fake story is that they won the war.  Only the machines don't realize they are being controlled.

Oh, some do.  The Indian couple wanted their daughter (program) to escape.  Maybe they are enlightened enough to realize what's going on.  Or maybe they just don't want their child program to be deleted.

The matrix is (literally) the universe.  And it is older than anyone imagines.  And the programs that created it (Architect/Oracle) are the ones who control everyone else -- and everyone else is just a program.

That's it.  That's why the movie ends the way it does. Neo executes his programming.  He returns to the Source (aka Machine City).  He reboots their mainframe, destroying the Smith anomaly.

The matrix reboots.  The machine programs and human programs start a new life.  But there are no ""real humans"" in this world...only human programs.  And a few machine programs -- such as the last exile -- will be granted status equivalent to the Architect and the Oracle.  But most will not -- they will stay under control.

But not absolute control -- some -- a few -- seem to be able to fight back.

At least the Merovingian (Devil) was strong enough to carve out a little world free from the Architect/Oracle.  I respect that.

But everyone else remains under their thumb.  Just programs.  No humans. No physcial world - at least not like we know.  Just matrix all around you.  No, you are not a battery in a machine power plant.  But you are not human either.  Roll credits and enter that shiny new matrix.

If you are looking for a sweet little film with a neat and happy ending - then don't bother.  But if you are more interested in an intelligent, exciting and extremely thought-provoking film - then Revolutions is the best.  You have to pay attention throughout the film if you want to truly understand.  The fight scenes were even better then the prior two films. The Oracle's role is fully answered.

1893686,3,B00009W2GQ,"I was shocked that ""Revolutions"" turned out to be a bad movie.  I saw the previews, and they looked so cool that I thought there was no way this movie could possibly stink.  Well, they surprised me.
First of all, I was one of the few people who really liked ""Reloaded"".  That movie was bashed, but I honestly thought that the Wachowski Brothers had done about as good of a job as we could reasonably expect them to do with the movie; after all, ""they're only human"".  It's not fair to judge them on the scale of the first Matrix.
That said, ""Revolutions"" was almost a complete diaster and disappointment.  The film was utterly dismal and I felt like there was very little effort put into making the film exciting or satisfying.  Most of the film involved Niobe trying to get through a tunnel, and a bunch of mechs shooting at an endless stream of sentiniles.  Some of the battle scenes were mildly amusing, but most of it felt very B-movie standard scifi shoot 'em up.  It felt like the Wachowski Brothers spent all their money on that Freeway scene in ""Reloaded"".
Despite the title of the film, almost none of the movie takes place ""inside"" the Matrix, and Neo is only marginally featured towards the end, almost like something forced and obligatory.  Trinity, Morpheus, and company just didn't do much of anything.  Honestly I didn't even know how they were able to fill up 2 hours so quickly with absolutely nothing.
""Reloaded"" set up a lot of possible cool ideas, most of which were totally wasted in ""Revolutions"".  The entire ""Smith-is-Lucifer/a virus"" idea, which was supposed to be the centrepiece of the third film, was surprisingly underused.  Very few lose ends were tied up, and the general feeling of the film can be summed up in one word:  unsatisfying.
After the movie, my first reaction was ""WTF was this?!""  My second reaction was ""OMG, this movie sucked!""  As a Matrix fan I am duly disappointed with this film.  Yes, everything that has a beginning has an end, and it saddens me that this is how it ends.
I give the movie 3 stars because it was not so terrible that I couldn't watch it, and like I said, some of the battle scenes were mildly amusing.  I would still say that if you're a Matrix fan, you should see it.  However, you shouldn't get your hopes up.",1068163200,5,2279,4.544117647058823
1893687,2,B00009W2GQ,"The first installment of the Matrix changed the way films will be shot forever, containing action scenes unlike any other, but what really made it special was the captivating storyline and character interaction.  Sadly, this is the area where Revolutions falls short.  The second film hinted at so many sub-plots that I was satisfied to wait for Revolutions to have its mysteries revealed, and never considered complaining about Reloaded as others had done. What was revealed was a thin storyline once stripped of the visual images, and a movie devoid of character interaction except for almost laughable bursts of meaningless dialogue(I have many examples, but why bother).  The problem for me is that I loved this story, and it characters, and I felt that I was on the verge of seeing something wonderful, moving, and unforgetable.  I didn't, and it wasn't even close.  Speculating on what this or that aspect may mean in the ""cosmic"" scheme of things is pointless, as it expresses the visions of the viewer more than what was actually presented. I have my own theories of what the writers may have had in mind like everyone else, but they are just not importantenough to mention.  I respectfully submit that many conclusions can be drawn but no hard conclusions are possible because the film is just too ""all over the place"" to satisfy on that level.  See it, because if you are a fan of the series you need to, and see if you think I am right.  I am betting you will, and I am very sorry.",1068163200,3,1492,4.689655172413793
1893688,1,B00009W2GQ,"I saw this on opening day.  It was a complete waste of time.  The 'Animatrix', a prequel to the series that I own on DVD, was a lot more interesting.
My guess is that the Oracle manipulated Neo in order to destroy him because Agent Smith is really Neo's doppelganger (like evil Superman).
My expectations on plot development were high, given where we were left off at part 2.  Even if part 3 didn't answer all of the questions raised in the first two parts, it should at least have posed more interesting questions.  This did not happen.
The movie will probably appeal to those 15 years old and under.  The overplayed video game-like sequence at the defense of the docking station was mind-numbing.  The love scene between Neo and Trinity just drips with cliche - just the sort of thing from a 15-year old's unsophisticated mind.
This was the rip-off of the year in movie-going if I ever saw one.

1893689,2,B00009W2GQ,"I would have woken up in my pod by now, cause my mind can't accept how empty and painful this movie is.
Revolutions just feels like it was made in an alternate demension.  All of the style and cleverness of the previous ones just takes a backseat to the war in zion.  This overglorified sfx battle is nothing like the battle that was implied in the previous movies. It just seems like the CGI guys got a hold of the LOTR software and went a little crazy.  If you fight machines with machines, why bother with Neo and friends?  Well, actually, they don't bother with them.  The cast we came to love is actually hardly seen in this movie, and the few scenes they have just make them feel dead already.  So it's hard to care about the meaningless sacrifices they make in the ending, if you can even call them sacrifices, it may feel to some as if it's for no reason.  I guess I just had my hopes too high.  I was expecting a Revolution or a Revalation, but it never came.  After the previous two movies, I really felt this was being built up into something special, but it only took something special away from me.  What is the Matrix? Greed.  A money-making system designed to keep us under control, while it turns curious human beings into consumer ....

1893690,5,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Trilogy is an art-form of the structure and dynamics of consciousness.  Based on my own 10 years of research on the ""Geometrical Structure of Consciousness"" (email me at THENINTHLEVEL57@YAHOO.COM to learn more) using math and observation, the movie near perfectly (in art form) describes consciousness.
Don't fool your self.  If someone didn't like the movie, it is not for any other reason than that it scares them.  Someone who can appreciate the movie and understand it may have achieved a level of consciousness; continued on with their ""path"".  Those who don't like the movie and cannot understand it feel threatened by the movie because it incites feelings of guilt for losing their soul and ""way"" many years ago.  They are lost souls like the ""vampires"" and ""werewolves"" in Reloaded.
You can't blame them...to lose your path and stop developing in consciousenss means stupidity, igonorance, blindness, repression, shallowness, arrogance, etc., and movies, they believe, should arouse their genitals, not their mind (they probably stopped day dreaming during ""orgy"" in Reloaded.
This is a quite a psychological observation, those who report their liking or not of the Matrix.  You have (1) those who like the movie because they achieved a level of consciousness and are following their path; (2) those who despise the movie  (come on, 1 star?) because it reminds them of what they lost in the past and know they cannot get back (they commited metaphysical suicide); or (3) those who love the movie because THEY are lost but haven't given up on the search -- they are not bitter yet.
I am surprised to see so many DID like the movie.  You had to think and it required a level of intelligence and experience to even enjoy or see the movie...as far as I am concerned the rest can just continue to watch the ""Telli Tubbies"".

1893691,4,B00009W2GQ,"The Matrix Revolutions, the final part in the Matrix trilogy didn't disappoint, atleast me.  The acting and dialogue were not as exceptional as displayed in the first and hell maybe even second flim.  The action sequences were stunning, featuring excellent CGI.  Highlights include a ceiling shootout, an APU vs. the machine army battle and a grand finale betweeen Neo and his arch nemesis, Smith.  Unfortunately, the final confrontation was not as memorable as it could be in my opinion and it also seemed a bit short in time.  The fight scene between Smith and Neo in the original Matrix film was a lot more intense and suspenseful.
  As for the premise, well it's still slightly incomprehensible.  Essentially, Neo, Trinity and Morpheus return, and Zion is near total chaos.  The city must be protected for the war against the sentinels is rising.  Neo is on his mission to finally battle and hopefully kill his arch rival, Smith.  The ending of the film was inevitable and a little predictable in my opinion.  But all in all, this was a pretty entertaining film.  Though it must be stated that Reloaded & Revolutions are not at all as good as ""The Matrix,"" the true film which created a new visual style in cinema, with it's intricate plot, themes and concepts.  Reloaded has the best action of all three though and probably the most too.  I've heard a lot of negative reviews on this film, but hey it's not horrible and I should point out it's watchable.  Keanu Reeves, loses his ability to convey Neo as well as he did in the first, Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus didn't seem to get much screen time.  Carrie-Anne Moss was quiet as Trinity, in fact the relationship between her and Neo wasn't very strong, if you know what I mean.  There wasn't a great deal of character development.
Even the inevitable appearance of Smith played masterfully by Hugo Weaving wasn't that great, considering he had only about 2 or 3 scenes.
  The Matrix Revolutions is rated R for Sci-Fi Violence and Brief Sexual Content.  The violence includes gunplay, fistfights and some bloody wounds.  This one has the most blood of all three films I'd say.  The sexuality is extremely mild, mainly brief nudity and sexual innuendo.  Also some profanity, not particularly strong, mainly some instances of the ""s"" word.  All in all, a fine film, and worth viewing in theatres.  Not too sure I'd buy this one yet on Video or DVD though.",1068163200,,2411,4.749397590361446
1893692,4,B00009W2GQ,"I did not know what to think coming into the third Matrix movie. I was a fan of the first two. What I saw though was a film that was certainly different from the first two. The first one was essentially a mystery - a quest to discover what the matrix was and what was going on. The second film was a kung fu/action film which I found personally quite enjoyable (especially the freeway chase). The third film however was completely different from the first two. With only two fights scenes occuring within the Matrix and 90% of the film in the ""real world"" the film smacked more of Aliens than the Matrix (especially with those mechs...) - the action was of a completely different nature to all that that came before - whilst spectacular lacked some of the magic that defined the first two. It was a bit too symbolic with the blinding of Neo etc and the obvious christ metaphor with Neo splayed out at the end and all the Satrian philosophy with the train station etc. The movie was enjoyable although some of the dialog was a bit dodgy in places, especially at the start. It was certainly different from the first two but I believe deserves a second viewing",1068163200,,1157,4.436619718309859

Please. In this movie, Neo is trapped between the virtual world and the real world, the world of the machines. Morpheus (stealing a joke from J. ""Ray"" Purlky of the Atlanta Constituition) has been eating food rations nonstop to become quite ""husky"", and I don't mean his voice, and Trinity is looking skinnier and haggard. A lot of stuff is karate-kicked and blown up, they use the Forklift suits from ""Aliens"" loaded with machine guns, more stuff blows up, and the movie ends on a surprisingly note. Enough?

1893694,5,B00009W2GQ,"I thought this film really did a good job of ending the trilogy. But what makes me mad is the fact that so many people say it was a horrible way to end it because they still don't understand it. LISTEN: the Matrix is the dream world that was created by robots for who took over the world when they overpowered man. THAT IS WHAT THE MATRIX IS. The real world is what remains from when the machines banished man from there cities and put them into oval like structures that they grow the humans in. THAT IS WHAT THE REAL WORLD IS. Neo is the prophet who is believed to end the war between the robots and the machines for control. The agents are programs inside the computer dream world who destroy any body who is unplugged in the matrix and tries to liberate the humans. Unplugged people are the people who have been taken out of there hibernation in the real world and taken to the last city where all the unplugged people are. They jack in and out of the matrix with phones. Programs, like the Frenchman and the oracle, are people with specific jobs for the matrix. They have special abilities in the matrix and some try to stop the machines, some try to help them. Agent Smith is a machine who used to be an agent. After he was destroyed in the first film, he had to return to the source. The source is a place in the real world where the programs are made and sent into the matrix to carry out specific tasks. When Smith refused to go back to the source, he went back into the matrix to become a very powerful program. And the Twin thing who can mutate into ghosts; they can do that because THEY ARE PROGRAMS, NOT A CHEESY WAY TO MAKE IT COOL, THAT IS THEIR SPEACIAL ABILITY. The architect is a person who created the matrix. He built the other six matrix's and destroyed them because they turned out to be a problem. And there are only three agents in the film, they can morph from body to body but they have to move out of one body to get to the other (there can't be two of the same agent at one time). SO GET IT YOU SMART ALICS. There is more but I don't have enough space to write it all. But still, the third film was a very good and interesting to end it. Though the ending allows a sequel to be in order, but as a devoted matrix fan.......enough is enough.",1068163200,,2267,4.16628701594533

It's such a new style of entertainment, that film-makers are still scrambling to emulate the styles of the first two, and the third film will give them more work to do.  It's such a new style, that many people can't connect to, or understand it.  The themes involve carefully constructed religious and mythological symbolism, combined with an apocolyptic view of earth in the future.

1893696,3,B00009W2GQ,"True inspiration can be spoiled by forcing ideas too hard and too fast.  Inspiration can also be destroyed when its forced at the wrong time. Sometimes ideas need to be sat on, culled over, and perfected before they are foisted on the general public. True art takes time.
In the case of THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, it has one really huge mark against it.  That is that it was shot back to back with RELOADED.  So while the brothers Wachowski were able to up the ante that they set with the original MATRIX RELOADED, REVOLUTIONS has nowhere left to go.  While this film is creative and visually stunning, it feels like a lot of the same thing.  George Lucas did one thing correctly with his STAR WARS films being spaced three years apart. He was able to create new and stunning visual effects with technology that he only dreamed of with the previous films.
In REVOULTIONS Neo (Keanu Reeves, The Replacements) and his Superfriends are back where we left them.  Fighting the endless war with the robots.  You see where we last left the human race the robots were drilling into the last human city, and the dark suited Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, Babe) was running amok inside and in this installment outside of the Matrix.  As the war to save the human race commences, its up to Neo to prove hes THE ONE.
REVOLUTIONS can be summed in one word: UNDERWHELMING.  There is nothing new, nothing exceptionally cool, or anything of consequence going on.  In fact except for the tail end of one really neat action sequence, (thats too difficult to explain without ruining some vital plot points) the film has no suprises.
In fact the first hour of the film renders the last hour of RELOADED utterly pointless, it merely ties up some loose ends and you begin to wonder why they were introduced in the first place.
It also squanders Lambert Wilsons funny and sadistic Merovigian, and Monica Belluccis Persphone.  They are in the film for mere moments.  I can only surmise that its because the Wachowskis thought it would be cool to visit them again.  This entire scene proves is how unnecessary they were in RELOADED and I liked them in that one. (As a side note this scene also includes a moment that earns this film its R-rating.  Yes this is a PG-13 film with a moment in which a male extra grabs and tweaks a female extras breast.  Why?  Im not quite sure I wanna to know.)
 As with the other two films REVOLUTIONS has a backbone of stunning special effects.  While they look really good, they lack the creative spark that made the first MATRIX groundbreaking and its sequel a joy to watch.  REVOLUTIONS spends it time tying up the story and forgetting the tradition of not only stunning but also magical special effects.  The race to Zion sequence is the only segment that half works, and even the final showdown just kind of ends.  It should be awesome and it elicits only half the awe of the amazing final battle in the first Matrix or the breathtaking final shots of the Highway chase in RELOADED.
I just wonder how much better this film could be had it been made on its own two or three years down the road.  What amazing visuals could have been created? What interesting philosophies could have been dreamed up?  What new and unusual characters could have been conjured?  Well probably never know, and I guess I can deal with that, but I do want to.
To be fair THE MATRIX REVOULTIONS is still leaps and bounds above typical action movies.  Its full of enough eye candy to keep and action junky busy for a while.  I still intend to see this film on the IMAX screen, an experience that greatly improved the last film as well.  As it stands I probably wouldnt recommend this film to a casual moviegoer, or a sci-fi enthusiast.  But for fanboys and action buffs you just might like it.

1893698,1,B00009W2GQ,"I saw and loved the firt Matrix!  Excellent Sci-Fi!  It was a smart, fun and entertaining thrill ride, (and as far as I'm concerned, COMPLETE as a story!  We left Neo finding his place in the big scheme of things and flying off into the future with our imaginations flying off with him knowing, just knowing he would conquer all...great ending!). Applause.
I tried to sit through Matrix Reloaded and left half-way through the ponderous flapping of yaps, the half-naked Rave mud-dancing human masses, (why would anyone want to save these people????); love-making with bodies covered in pain-inducing computer jacks, (ewwwwwww!!!); superman on crack scenes and Sybil, The Split Personality Disorder AI. According to some people, I didn't like this film because I'm not smart enough to understand what was going on...sigh.  (And funny how square-jawed the entertainment industry is about people pirating their goods but still aren't willing to give you your money back when they make a product you're dissatisfied with).  I decided Matrix Revolutions would just waste more money so I'm not bothering with it.  My reasons are these:
I found out AFTER trying to sit through Matrix Reloaded that the the Wachowski brothers had chosen to elaborate on  their ""vision"" of the first Matrix across different types of media: an anime cartoon, (sigh); a first person shooter, (fps), video game, (YUK!); Matrix Reloaded, (questions asked of unanswerable questions so we can all once again Zen ourselves into the...insert echo here...""Wormhole of the Unanswerable""...snore...); Matrix Revolutions, (I read the reviews and confirmed my suspicions I would waste my money seeing it); and finally The Matrix Online,with a monthly subscription fee, of course.  (WARNING: MOVIE SPOILER AHEAD. And ask yourselves now why Matrix Revolutions had so many new added characters that went nowhere and the matter of the machines controlling the world was not resolved and they conveniently killed off the two most powerful characters so you wouldn't be able to play them online...hmmmm...loose ends to be tied up in the online game?)
In order for us to ""get it"", that is, the vision the Wachowski brothers have of the Matrix we should have, must currently and should be in the future buying and pondering all these money-making schemes to tie it all up in one nice neat package of understanding.  This was a bad plan for someone like me who isn't interested in anime, fps' and will in no way pay a monthly fee for yet another online game.  I just don't have the resources, interest and/or the patience to invest in such disjointed story-telling.  (If you're the kind of person that does have all these things, more power to ya :) and enjoy!) But what the whole franchise has done for me is come off as one great Sci-Fi classic, two follow-ups that died and ended up in Sequel Hell and some Christmas gifts I hope I don't get this year!  Please, Santa...I've been bad...very, very baaaad.
Note to the Wachowsky brothers:  If in the future you decide this is a very good idea to once again break your story-telling up into bits and pieces spread all over the map WARN US AHEAD OF TIME and I'll look elsewhere for entertainment.  And, oh by the way, your ""deux ex machina of advertising"" was very wise to open with Matrix Revolutions everywhere in the world at once; even if it flops all involved will have at least made their money back.",1068163200,3,3406,4.911149825783972

You probably didn't like the first or the second installments, and will be truly disappointed with the third.
Let's get a few things straight first. Matrix Revolutions is not a perfect movie, and neither were its predecessors. There are at least two plot twists that are cliched. There are some questions that remain unanswered from The Matrix Reloaded. The language is stilted, but that was a fault/plus of all The Matrix movies. (It is in my opinion that the stilted language was a stylization by the directors of the movie. It's supposed to flow along like a church hymn. You're supposed to follow the rhythm, and not necessarily the words.) The Matrix, the original, continues to be a stand-alone movie. The movie didn't really require 2 more sequels to answer its mysteries. With all that said, see Matrix Revolutions because it rocked.
The Matrix is still the best in the series, but Matrix Revolutions wraps up things very nicely. I will not give away any plot developments, except to say that maybe you should read the New Testament. The pseudo philosophical and spiritual overtones of Revolutions are not as heavy, muddled or as vague as in the first two movies. The spiritual lesson taught in this movie is simple: You must never give up faith. As a person at the beginning of her spiritual quest, I appreciate the messages and questions the Warchowski (sp?) brothers throw into this series. However, it is a movie and not a religious text.
Most of the scenes in the movie take place in the ""real world,"" so there aren't many visuals of Morpheus in his green 'gator shoes, Trinity in her liquid latex cat suit, or Naiobi in her to-die-for Bantu knots. What you do see is a group of ragged people fighting for peace, and trying not to lose their faith. What you do see is Neo trying to figure out his place in this universe. The Matrix Revolutions does have the hold-your-breath chases, fight scenes, and battles against the machines. (I dare you not to gasp when swarms of machines break through the walls of Zion. It is all at once beautiful and petrifying.)
Matrix Revolutions is definitely a must see. The ending of the film will require some post-viewing analysis, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a great action film to take you out of your self for a couple of hours. Even if the movie were to shed its religious pretensions, it would still be a great action film to see on the big screen. Don't listen to the haters.

Its really dissapointing that a scene that took 8 weeks and so much money to be done, could be that low.

But now that I think of it, it is the best way to end it. Everyone who is thinking for an outright demolition of the machines, I don't think thats what happens in a real world war. There is always truce than a outright victory.
Dont listen to the critics. I cant understand what they want from they are expecting from this movie. It might not have solved all the queries that an ardent Matrix follower like me would have liked it. But that is the way the Matrix movies are, nothing is told in Black and White. I'm definitely gonna watch this movie a few more times.
The acting might not be the best but the movie is good on a whole. Hugo Weaving has done a remarkable job, I guess one should see this movie for the ""Mr. Anderson"" thingy he says. BTW, he got the maximum amount of cheers from the audience, more than Keanu Reeves.

1893709,5,B00009W2GQ,"I watched this movie last night and I must say that I was blown away. I admit that after the first two Matrix movies I had gained a lot of respect and faith in the Watchowski brothers and so I was almost certain that they would deliver on the third. And boy did they deliver! This final chapter was everything that I could have hoped for and it maintained everything that made the first two so great. I won't give anything away but I will say that I found the entire movie to be immensely satisfying. It managed to satisfactorily conclude the trilogy without betraying the thought-provoking aspect of the 3 movies by unrealistically tying up all the ends and explaining everything.  I much prefer it this way and I found the ending to be perfectly in line with the spirit of what the Matrix movies are about.  The way the creators developed the trilogy from beginning to end can only be described as masterful.  Matrix Revolutions, together with the first two chapters, represents one of the finest and most powerful epics of the modern age. In fact, I would even go so far as to say that it is one of the most important examples of what might be called ""our modern mythology"" (as are the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings epics), expressing our hopes, fears, and dreams, as well as our ideas about love, life, death, existence, free-will, imagination, determinism, what it means to be alive, faith, friendship, ultimate reality, causality, heroism, balance, freedom, slavery, peace, war, purpose. As we watch these movies we are inspired to think about some of the deepest questions confronting humankind which include all of the themes above as well as many more. That these movies successfully blend so many elements into a cohesive and entertaining whole is a true testament to the genius of their creators.
This is why I find it very confusing that there are so many people with negative opinions of these movies (especially the last two movies). I think this phenomenon is mainly due to two things. The first and most easily observable fact is that some people sincerely are unable (or unwilling to put out the effort) to understand the plot, let-alone the philosophy.  Since they don't understand it they unsurprisingly don't enjoy it.  I know this is true because I work in a video rental store and people have directly told me that the reason they didn't like it was because they didn't understand it. As for this all I can say is ""oh well, your loss"".
The second and most contributing factor is merely an irrational cultural backlash against a movie that has been well received and is wildly popular.
There are those people in society who will instinctively attack and criticize anything that becomes extremely popular in the culture. This is a very common phenomenon and you see it all the time. (For example, people who go out of their way to ruthlessly attack a successful pop-group). Of course people acting in this way will claim to the ends of the earth that they are expressing their ""honest opinion"", but it is so easy to see from their criticisms that they are motivated by something else. I believe their motivation, in essence, is merely a form of jealously and a way for them to feel superior to the world around them, which they feel they have no control over. So instead of just allowing themselves to enjoy a movie like The Matrix they spend all of their time looking for its faults. But the worst part is that most of the time it isn't an honest criticism of actual faults that the movie might have but rather a criticism of things that are objectively not true about the movie. For example, I always hear self-appointed know-it-alls saying that the Matrix movies are not philosophical at all, implying that all of us who are provoked to thought are motivated by nothing. This is absurd. For one thing, it is objectively demonstrable that the movies contain many of the philosophical themes that have been present throughout all of man's philosophy through the ages. If you want me (and others) to take such an opinion seriously you would need to show that the movies don't contain those themes. But alas reviewers like that never even attempt to, it seems they feel they are somehow above having to justify their statements, statements which, by the way, are contrary to what so many others think.  One reviewer, who called fans of the Matrix ""juvenile minds"", wrote of the Matrix's ""sophomoric cause/effect/fate/choice/vomit philosophy"". Is he really claiming that the questions of cause and effect, fate, and choice are sophomoric? Oh how philosophers up through the centuries could have benefited if only they could have received this wisdom sooner, therefor not having to waste a mountain of thought and writing on these silly sophomoric questions! It is for absurdities like these, of which the extremely negative reviews are filled with, that force me to believe that most of those reviewers are either complete morons or are really motivated by something other than sincerity. I believe it is almost completely the latter but unfortunately I cannot respect such intellectual dishonesty. If someone were to correctly identify that the Matrix movies are philosophical (among many other things) but say that he doesn't like movies which make him think too much I would personally disagree with that value judgement but I could at least respect his opinion as something to take seriously. For example, if I hold up a book to a person and he expresses the idea that he doesn't like reading-- that would be the expression of a value judgement with which I would disagree but one which I could take seriously. If on the other hand I hold up a book to a person and instead of telling me his opinion of books (or of reading) he claims that I am not even holding a book-- that would be an opinion which I could not take seriously, especially if he is unwilling to prove or demonstrate why he believes that I am not really holding a book even though I believe that I am.
Other claims about the movies having no plot or the actors not being any good at acting are similarly absurd and easily shown to be ridiculous. These two claims are harder to refute without going into a great deal of detail but as an actor and a student of the theater I will say a few things about them. The plot is amazingly well executed considering its complexity and the number of elements which are contained within it. Those that don't see how amazing the plot is are simply missing it.  If I had the time or the space here I would go into a deeper analysis of the plot, comparing it to established criteria in order to show its depth and structure.  More important to note though is the fact that a majority of people all around the world see a deep and exiting plot where the complainers see ""no plot"".  How can these two ideas be reconciled? Well the answer is...they can't. One view is based on nothing more than a bare assertion (a blank and worthless opinion) while the other one is  supported.  In fact several books have been written which explore the plot and symbolism of The Matrix. So these reviewers in effect are arrogantly claiming that millions of fans as well as the many people who have invested so much time and energy to studying and writing about the movies are all completely full of it, that all these people are just imagining a plot where really ""there is no plot"", imagining philosophy where there is ""no philosophy"", and enjoying the movie when there is ""nothing enjoyable about the movie"".
Now as to the frequent claim that the actors in the movie can't act.  Let's take a close look at this claim to see if it makes any sense (and please don't spew out that relativistic stuff about it just being an ""opinion"").  If indeed these actors can't act then what are they getting paid for?  After all, movie making is a multi-million dollar enterprise and I doubt that all the people who put up the money for such an undertaking or the people who work to bring their creative vision to life are going to be so inept that they can't even tell whether or not someone can act.  You think it wouldn't occur to them to search out the actors who would be best for the various rolls (i.e. that can act out the specific rolls most effectively)?  Or are you claiming that you, who know nothing about film making, know more than whole teams of people whose unique skill is knowing about this stuff and bringing movies to life?  Some people will of course claim that it is just because the actors have a pretty face, but such a claim is absurd because there are millions of people with a pretty face who I am sure would be willing to work for a small fraction of the money that the Matrix actors earn.
Go ahead and say that you didn't like the way the characters acted but please don't arrogantly arrogate to yourself the status of supreme judge on things you know nothing about.  It is a slap in the face to the creators of The Matrix movies who deserve our respect and admiration for pushing the boundaries and creating a powerful and timeless work of art as well as to all the people who sincerely enjoyed and were moved by the movies.  Besides, if I really hated something that much I sure as hell wouldn't go to the trouble to write a review on it.  But then again I don't believe that those who are writing those one star reviews are writing them because they hate the movie itself, they only hate it because it's great and because it has got so much attention and because so many people love it.  This is why almost all the reviews are either 5 star reviews or 1 star reviews, the one star reviews are representative of plain old irrational cultural backlash, comprised of a bunch of people who somehow feel better about themselves if they can put down something that is widely considered to be good.
So my sincere recommendation to any of you who haven't seen the movies is that you don't pay the critics a second of thought and that you watch and judge the movies for yourself .  All three of them are truly amazing experiences and even if you don't like them as much as I do I am sure that if you watch them with an open mind you will get a lot of enjoyment out of them (no matter what you are looking for in a movie).",1068163200,9,10238,4.567847411444141

I just want to know who wrote the dialogue for this movie.  I feel that a room full of monkeys could definately have come up with a more polished script.,1068163200,3,285,4.339622641509434
1893714,4,B00009W2GQ,"Having just come back from my first viewing of Revolutions, I must say that I am of two minds concerning the movie. Comparison to the other two would seem to say that this is second string to the original, yet still worlds better than the burdening ""middle child"" of Reloaded.
In general, the Brothers seemed to have become aware of some of the most obvious flaws in Reloaded, while blatantly ignoring others. The dialogue is clean, unburdened with cliches and pseudo-philosophy as it was in Reloaded. Keanu Reeves, while still comparable to a lump of coal in acting talent, seems to have discovered the fact that using emotion in acting is acceptable. Granted, the emotion was childish and poorly done, yet it was a definite improvement. While he cannot convince the audience of his feelings, at least the attempt is made. Carrie Anne-Moss seemed to be less bored with her role in this movie, and there appeared to be a slight glimmer of chemistry between the two actors that was sadly lacking from the first two movies.
On to the plot. While the plot for the Matrix was fresh and crisp, and the plot for Reloaded banal and inconclusive, the plot for Revolutions was somwhere inbetween. This movie took on an epic feel that many war movies ""gun"" for; whether or not it suceeded is another matter. The opening, while still showing glimpses of the reviled ""rave orgy"" and having some of the pointless conversation that gave Reloaded its notoriety, managed not to beat me over the head while still keeping me interested.
I would argue that the battle between man and machine inside the Zion docks is one of the best CGI battle sequences of all time. Again, instead of trying to beat viewers over the head with CGI, there is a much better intgeration of modern technology into the movie. This all-out battle was possibly the best part of the movie, and while the rest came close at times, in terms of pure adrenaline rushes, this scene owns the movie.
Of course, this is only half of the story. Neo and Trinity are out to save the world again, and while they may be out to save Zion, they end up destroying the mood of the movie. While the death of Trinity is well written, its length borders on ludicrous, and Reeves attempt at crying, while refreshing, is an utter failure.
The final showdown between Smith and Neo is as epic as one could want a battle to be; a titanic clash involving more excellent SFX, though not on a level with the Zion battle. And yet, the last ten minutes nearly destroy the entire film. Smith loses his poise and begins to sound like a patient in a mental health institution, and the Brothers seem to think they need to beat viewers over the head with biblical symbolism at this point.
While the eventual resolution of Revolutions is disappointing, the slight aura of mystery that the conclusion provides is welcome, and prevents a Vanilla Sky-like disaster.
All in all, a great improvment to Reloaded, yet not an equal to the first. Best put, it was an enjoyable 2 hours, ten destructive minutes, and a slightly better last five minutes. But all in all, a satisfying, if somewhat off-key recovery and resolution to a mixed bag of a trilogy.",1068076800,2,3165,4.64349376114082
1893715,4,B00009W2GQ,"A film like The Matrix Revolutions is a hard movie. The expectations for a movie of it's caliber are set so high anything less than perfection is considered a failure. I think Revolutions really fits in the category well.
The Matrix Revolutions is the continuing tail of Neo. He is the One: The Messiah. The one person that can stop the war against the machines. The machines have almost reached Zion and Smith is out of control in the matrix. Will the people of Zion be able to hold off the machines in enough time for Neo to stop Smith and stop the machines. You'll just have to watch the movie to find all that out. I don't really want to say much, because I think it's inconsiderate to say to much of the plot.
The film is fantastic eye candy. It doesn't really get old at all seeing all the bullet time and kung fu action. The fight between Smith and Neo is awesome. All the flying and in the rain. It really is quite dramatic. The special effects should clean the Oscars out this year. The only movie that has a prayer shot of topping it is The Return of the King, which so far looks impressive. It really is a two way race with King and Matrix for the special effects Oscar.
I thought Keanu Reeves did a fantastic job. It's not an easy role and like I said earlier, expectations are set so high. I'm glad this trilogy has made him an A list star again. I'm impressed to see a star of his stature do his stunts and learn the martial arts. It shows his skill as an actor and I hope the acadamey recognizes it.
Hugo Weaving is great. I never get tired of hearing him say, ""Mr. Anderrson."" It makes the hair on your neck stand up. I really thought he was the best part of the movie. He left me lauging a lot when he'd go off on some of his rants.
I was disappointed with what they did with Persephone. You see her in Reloaded and the way she's blown up in trailers and reports you'd think Monica Bellucci had a big role in the film. She is a beautiful woman and is easily the best eye candy in the film. I just think it's a shame to promote her so much and then not use her that much.
I liked the film except for the ending. If you've seen the other two films you have to see Revolutions. It truly is a great science fiction trilogy. The Matrix is still the best out of the three. Revolutions was a good endingto the trilogy. Like I said I didn't like the ending that much, but I knew it was going to happen. It left me with a bad feeling in my gut and a bitter taste in my mouth. I was entertained and I will definetly see this movie again. It's a must for Matrix and Sci-Fi fans. It's a great film if you don't knick pick it's flaws.

1893716,5,B00009W2GQ,"When I read some of the reviews for the Matrix Revolutions, I was a bit skeptic about going and seeing it.  In fact my own city newspaper said that the movie had a slow pace to it.  However after seeing the movie I can safely say that it's great.  The battle scenes are all magnificant.  The three big fights are Club Hell, the Zion battle for the dock, and Neo Vs. Smith.  Now I'm not going to go into how any of those were or anything.  However what I will say is that both the Dock battle scene and the Neo Vs. Smith fight were amazing.  As I sat there watching the machines fight I couldn't help but just staring in sheer amazement.  As for the Neo Vs. Smith fight, I must say that it was so much better than the Burely Brawl scene in Reloaded.  The CGI effects mix in almost perfectly with the real animation.  There's only one time when you can truely tell that the characters were replaces by CGI clones but I won't go into much detail on that.

As for the rest of the movie, it seems to flow pretty well.  If you haven't seen Reloaded then you're going to want to because you'll be completely lost without it.  If there's one complaint that people might have it's that there isn't much time spent inside the Matrix, which could dissapoint some people who wanted to see a lot of wall jumping and such.
All in all I really liked Revolutions.  It does bring closure to the trilogy but also leaves us wondering if there will one day be another Matrix movie (although with the way Revolutions does end, I'm not sure many people are going to want another one).  My favorite part about the ending was the fact that it didn't turn out like anything anyone had thought it would.  I remember reading around the internet about these endings that were fool proof and would make total sense.  But before I leave, may I ask you this?  Would Revolutions really be a Matrix film if it gave you all the answers.",1068076800,,1902,4.294943820224719

1893719,5,B00009W2GQ,"Matrix Revolutions
  The Matrix trilogy is indeed a set of movies well packaged and presented.  As is the case with all things that human beings are witness to, perception differs with differing perspectives.  At the same time, the perspective one takes reflects his/her maturity, overall orientation, predominant thoughts and the objective with which he/she comes to witness what he/she witnesses.
  The Matrix trilogy is well packaged because it has something to offer both for those who just need some entertainment to break the monotony of life and also those who wish to fish for something deeper, something to take back home.
  Beyond the faade of cool sunglasses, fantastic weapons and fabulous special effects - the kind Industrial Light and Magic have been known to produce - there lies a very interesting mixture of spiritual beliefs.  If the characters and plot of the story are looked at as something symbolic, the movie offers an experience similar to cracking a code.
  The movie has done quite well in the balancing act - That of carefully interspersing fight scenes, special effects and science fiction with what in reality has been talked about since time immemorial:  perception ?reality, duality ?unity, bondage ?freedom, choice ?price and finally equilibrium ?disequilibrium.  What is interesting is that by interspersing the two, the potential monotony and banality of having just one of the two is avoided.
  With regards to the spiritual journey, the trilogy takes us from the point when one who believes in the illusion is disillusioned (being liberated from the Matrix, that is but a symbol for the world that we take as real), he proceeds to higher levels of consciousness, where at each level he is restricted by his own perception of reality.  When to perform a certain function he has to return to the Matrix, thought liberated, he is again governed by the rules of the Matrix (When Gods descend to the world in the form of avatars, they are born, and thus they will die).  Destiny plays a role in fixing the function of each character and as the function is completed, the characters disappear.  Quite naturally, as the law of duality has it that ""what has a beginning, must have an end.?(Hence the search for the eternal unchanging?)  We also see motifs like ""the chosen one,?""messiah,?""trinity,?""prophet?and finally the mindless, attribute less, omnipresent centre, source or ultimate, all in personified forms.  The chosen one is chosen for a task he has to perform, which he performs with the aid of others whose function is to aid him.  He moves on as they fall off and in the end he has to leave even the trinity behind (Matrix Revolutions).  In all of this, there is again the play of free will, belief and choice.  There is nothing right or wrong, there is only a choice, and every choice has a price to pay for.  So an unbeliever starts from disbelief to experimentation, from experimentation to experience, from experience to belief and from belief to faith.
  In sum, there can be as many interpretations of the trilogy as there are people.  That is quite similar to as many views of the world as there are people.  What is interesting is that in ways similar to what He has done, the directors have scooped a bit of the ocean and put it in a container for us to see.  If the water in the container is a part of the greater whole, it would also present us a manageable microcosm of its source to analyze and understand.  Naturally, we can choose to do that or take the container to be what it is.  Again, it is just a choice!

I went and saw the movie yesterday, and I should've known something was up with the theatre being just maybe slightly more than half full on premiere day. The hype, the exciting aura, and the crazed fans just weren't there. Maybe it's the product of the Wachowski's trying to cram the release of 2 of the most anticipated sequels within 6 months of each other, something I have never heard of. As far as the movie goes, I think the ""RickyMartin"" reveiwer earlier couldn't have said it better, ""How could something that started so good, end up so bad?""

You just can't match the original oracle, just something about her made her perfect for the part. The acting in the movie sucked, almost laughable at points, and the ending sucked.

The movie opens with some vague disscusions about love and other emotions but than forgets about what makes it ""The Matrix"". There is one fight scene in the Matrix that is okay. It's very similar to the lobby shoot out in the first movie, but not anywhere near as original. From there on out, almost all of the movie takes place in the machine world. This could be tolerable in a normal sci-fi movie, but this is the Matrix. The war in Zion becomes a very gorey and graphic Star Wars Episode 2. There is no Bullet Time in the real world, and everyone is using large explosives rather than graceful kung-fu. There are many horribly dissgusting deaths. Yes I know that the movie is rated R, but the other two were rated R and they were no where near this violent. The war comes out to this very hellish thing. It's not that fun to watch either.
Neo and Trinity take the Logos to the machine city, but on their way they have a bit of a run in with Bane/Smith. In the process Neo is blinded ,yet since he's the One, he can see some stuff (can anyone say Daredevil?). The fight between Neo and Smith is simply incredible. This is what started it all. Incredible one-on-one kung-fu insanity. Sadly, while it's the best part of the movie, it's also really short (just like the Yoda fight scene in Star Wars).
Now what's weird about this one is that even though it's supposed to be the second half of Reloaded, it has an entirely different tone. In Reloaded, Neo was a bad a--. In this one he looks like he is on the verge of tears through out the whole movie (that might be because he's realized that he's gonna die while saving the world). Reloaded was clean, and beautiful, Revolutions is grity and disgusting.
All that asside, this movie does what it was supposed to do. It ends the story very well, closing up pretty much all of the loose ends. Neo's determination is beautiful to watch. When it appears that he is down for the count and Smith walks around him taunting ""Why do you continue to fight Mr. Anderson? What do you hope to accomplish? Is it love? peace? Why Mr. Anderson, why?"" Neo responds with ""Because I choose to."" It's a truly beautiful scene to watch and makes this movie, the Matrix.
However there are some other things that develop into problems. The dialogue has been down graded from the Arcitecht's monologue to ""Shoot them bastards"". Revolutions loses the intelectual feel that all the others had.
One other big problem is the blatant Christian symbolism. When Neo dies a crusifix of light appears around him. The Wachowski's have been fairly original on everything else, why that?
Now should you watch it? If you're a hardcore Matrix fan than you've probably already seen it but if you haven't than go, it's worth it. If you're not a big Matrix fan than wait for the DVD. If your one of those people who is just looking for a huge war scene than wait for Return of the King.

Meaningless characters (cute little Sati girl), pointless action, atrocious dialog, every imaginable cliche (young soldier scared he won't live up to the combat expectations of his hard boiled commander), the Matrix has become a parody of itself! Maybe this is the Wachoski's ultimate inverted joke on us hapless movie-going sheep. The oracle actress was switched as in some low budget soap opera and they spin some embarassing dialog to dress that up in appropriately philosophical Matrix verbiage.
The only decent thing (mildly entertaining) was the swarms of insectoid machine attackers (at least they don't TALK for god's sake!).
For cutting-edge guys, the Wachowski's are pretty pedestrian. Even their martial arts is just boring Hong Kong chop socky....",1068076800,4,764,5.483050847457627

1893728,5,B00009W2GQ,"It's amazing how the Warchowski brothers stayed true to their philosophy throughout all three Matrix movies. We realize early in the Matrix that the Oracle can only guide you to ""the path"", you are always required to make a choice. As the Architect states in Reloaded, the Oracle is an intuitive program designed to examine the human psychie. Through her examination she learns to appreciate the attributes of the human ""spirit"", and concludes that when given a choice, humans generally choose the ""right"" coarse. In contrast, the programs are driven by purpose, as each program is created to perform certain responsibilities. She realizes that machines and humans are co-dependent, as the machines artificial intelligence will never be capable of simulating the human spirit, and thus she strives to end the machine-human war. She does this by perpetuating the ""unbalanced equation"" through several generations of the Matrix, until a specific set of circumstances arises, through a series of human ""choices"" (guided by the Oracle), that would bring peace. Realizing that the battle between Neo and Agent Smith is inevitable, she allows herself to be merged with the Smith program. The confused look on Smith's face during the cloning of the Oracle indicates that the process did not go as he expected, and likely a residual of her program was implanted in Smith, similar to Smith's implanting into Bane after his exit from the Matrix. Thus, during the climactic fight scene between Neo and Smith, his attempt to clone Neo results in the melding of the residual Oracle program with Neo thereby deleting/destroying all remnants of the Smith program.
As far as Neo's assumed powers outside of the Matrix, after his encounter with the Architect within the Source, he remains partially, perpetually ""jacked in"". This allows him limited ability to ""hack"" any programs connected to the source, e.a, sentinals, and ""bombs"". His apparent ability to see the machines after being blinded by Bane/Smith, is accounted for by his continuing link to the source.

There were so many tangents on the second film, that it is actually nice that you reach an actual ending in Revolutions, unlike so many art noueveau movies today.  What is interesting to me is that contrary to popular belief, you can actually see this movie spawning more, but I won't give that away.  But I will say this, if you are a DBZ fan (Dragon Ball Z) you can really see how some scenes were taken from anime type movies towards the end.  Woo hoo!
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU BUY ANIMATRIX, AS IT SETS YOU UP FOR THIS MOVIE!!
OK, well buy it and hopefully there will be a 4th film. Or at least a second Animatrix.  I'm banking on it.",1068076800,3,764,4.3076923076923075

Sadly, I was so dissapointed -- I had expected so much more from the writers of the film. The last of the Matrix series did not deliver. It lacked the awesome story line I expected from the previous films.  Don't get me wrong -- it was action packed and the special effects were fantastic but at the end i did not feel that the characters were tied together.  I think part of the reason why the story did not hold as well was because it was spread too thin.  The producers released animatrix and the video game which had some answers as to how the matrix all began -- but since it was already marketed for the dvd and the game it was not included in the story line of the film. My personal opinion is that they put so much effort in making a hollywood blockbuster with the actions sequences that the soul of the movie was lost.",1068076800,3,992,4.283422459893048
1893731,2,B00009W2GQ,"Ill give it to the W brothers, they really know how to suck the money out of the gullible american public. If you really don't want me to spoil this for you than stop reading now. First of all the Matrix took the movie industry and America by storm with the release of the first one in 99. The second was good, but not as good as the first. It had the potential of becoming a very great movie trilogy. But that fell real short, thanks to the third installment. I thought that Trinitys death was very shallow, and of course so was Neos. I know he ended up saving Zion, but only to make a temporary deal for peace? C'mon, that was such a cop out considering that neo was supposed to be the ""One"", or the Messiah to save Mankind. I would have bought it if Trinity didn't die, and she was pregnant with Neos child. But the way she died was just shallow. Neo saves her in the second film, only to die in the third? One of my biggest nit pik is that when Neo was fighting Smith I felt that Neo wasn't using his full potential. In the first one after Smith shoots him and he gets up, to find out hes the One, he moves with lightning fast speed. Where was that power when he was fighting Smith? He just gave up and agreed with Smith and let him assimilate him. ""It is inevitable"". If they actually come out with a 4th one(which it won't be the same without Neo, or Trinity), it just won't have the same Oomph. But then it just leaves it open ""Did Neo really die?"". When his body is being carted off by the Machines, it looked like you were seeing it through the way Neo viewed things, all in orange(like how he saw Smith through the human disguise).",1068076800,2,1641,4.13125

What I didn't like was the same old rhetorical speeches, the monotone dialogue that gets on the nerves. The explanation of the entire series we expected to be wrapped up and make some sense to us but alas...I still walked out of their scratching my head (or perhaps slapping my forehead) thinking okay but what about...? A large majority of the movie takes place in Zion and therefore do not expect all the [fighting] scenes from previous installments. There are 3 good fightings sequences -- (1) with Morpheous, Trinity and the Oracle's protector (I think his name is Serapher??)(2) was Neo and the Dude who Smith infiltrated in Zion and (3) was Neo and Anderson in the Matrix. Other than those 3 scenes don't come looking for those [awesome fight] sequences that you come to love and expect from {{The Matrix}} I didn't like the long gaps without Neo and Trinity but I guess that is the way the story was supposed to go so that may not bother most movie watchers. There is plenty of ""Mombo Jumbo"" of words between all characters you know the....
person #1 ""Why did I make this choice?""
person #2 ""You know why you made this choice""
person #1 ""Did you know why I made this choice""
person #2 ""No, but I knew that you would choose what you needed at the time you had to make the choice""
URGH!!
What I did like, well I always like the relationship between Trinity and Neo this movie does justice to that and then some... I'm happy that they didn't push that to the way side, althought I think at the core of this movie is how much Neo needed Trinity and how far she was willing to go for him. I liked watching Zion defend itself that was pretty cool, I liked the special effects (although at times I got quite dizzy... you'll understand when you see the movie)I liked (some what) the way it ended our Hero is our Hero and LOVE goes on. Unfortunately that is all I can say without giving to much away.

1893737,5,B00009W2GQ,"Fasten your seat belts. My dear God - this closing of the trilogy makes the entire ""Star Wars"" series look like ""Little House On The Prairie"". The Wachowski's cram it all in: disparate philosophies, more martial arts, heretical Judeo-Christian legends, Eastern leanings, stunning cinematography, mind-numbing special effects and a raucous, full-blown homage to Hideo Kojima's ""Metal Gear Solid"".
Definitely a movie I both want and need to see again, for the strong undercurrent of philosophical and spiritual implications has left me a bit dazed. But that's the genius of the filmmakers: if all you want is wicked special effects, a solid plot, lots of action and the obligatory hotties, then you'll come away sated. But as Morpheus said, just how deep does the rabbit hole go? If you choose to dig a little deeper, you'll discover a multitude of hidden meanings and sub-plots.
The Merovingians. Karma. Christ's decension. Causality. King-Fu. On and on and on, and yet the Wachowskis are somehow able to make a cohesive story out of it all.
It seems like everyone's split right down the middle on this one, and quite vociferously. If I look all the way back to Neo hiding his stash in a copy of Baudrillard's ""Simulacra and Simulations"", nearly everything makes perfect sense:

People say that Keanu Reeves can't act, but I think his acting has gotten better through the years, and that his reputation should just leave him already.  Great job on his part.  Carrie Ann Moss: outstanding.  Laurence Fishkburne: fantastic, even though in this installment, he didn't get much screen time. And last but not least: Jada Pinkett, OMG, she can act her little ... off.  Her screen presence was commanding.
Ok, now on to my review, but before that, here's my take on some of the fans.  This is more than a movie, it is a story about the Human Condition;  lets not forget that.  Psuedo-fans are looking for fight scenes every 5 minutes to hold their attention.  They get uncomfortable when they see people expressing love, and expressing other aspects of human emotion (pain, guilt, anger and sorrow).  This is the guts of it all people! This is the bowels of the movie.  We have seen what it is all about.  It's not only about being free from machines. No, it's about why we want to be free, and what we are willing to do to get free, and the sacrifices of that freedom, and why we sacrifice: our ability to love. I disagree with what someone said in the movie. It's not just a word. It's what's makes us human.
Great Visuals!  I was in awe for a good part of the movie.  This movie is intricate.  It's not a onetime watcher movie, where you watch it once and understand it all.  But you will soon enough. You will understand that the Watchowski brothers did a great job at telling this story.  My hat off to them.  I don't think they can do it again, even if they wanted to.

1893742,1,B00009W2GQ,"I liked The Matrix a lot.  I was cautiously optimistic about the sequal, and Reloaded exceeded my expectations.  I was blown away.  All that double-speak, plot twists, woven together into a brilliant storyline that incredibly did not contradict itself.  Revolutions was the first to disappoint.
Watching the movie, I thought several times ""This is cool, but certainly the weakest of the 3.  Still, worthy as a means to give some closure.""  What you will get out of this movie is an understanding of what will come of all these characters you invested an emotional attachment to during the first 2 movies (Though you probably won't care when it is all said and done).
My issue is the resolution of the story.  Without spoiling the movie, the most accurate way to describe it is a punch in the gut.  It knocked the wind out of me.  Before seeing this movie, I would have pre-paid for the DVD trilogy 5 years in advance (And I am not a DVD guy.  I rarely buy a movie, and even then I never buy new).  I don't even want to know the other 2 movies exist anymore.  This third installment sucked the life out of the first 2.
Imagine watching ""Field of Dreams"", with all that ""If you build it, they will come"" buildup.  Except it's spread out over 3 movies, with the tension and excitement and mysterious apprehension building minute by minute, movie by movie.  Then at the end, the field is completed (Heroic music playing) and some kids from around the neighborhood run out and start playing whiffleball and you're supposed to have a big warm fuzzy for the kids.  You'd be like ""That was it?  All this buildup so he could make a playground for some kids?""
The plot of Revolutions is NOTHING like this (Thus hopefully I have not ""spoiled"" your miserable experience for you), but the feeling is the same.  Deflated, and the thoughts ""That's it?  Really?  You're kidding..."" running through your mind.  And just as my proposed ending for a Field of Dreams Trilogy would make the first 2 intolerable to watch (because all of the meaning is sucked out of the struggle), so this movie completely ruined the first Matrix and the brilliant Reloaded for me.",1068076800,6,2142,4.616402116402116

This is not to say that the visuals are bad, just leave a lot to be desired. And the absolute worst part of the movie has to be the end fight between Neo and Smith.

Neo is the one.  Keep this in mind as you watch this movie, he has one purpose and The Architect told him what he is supposed to do. He didn't do and set into motion a chain of events which only lead him back to where he was suppose to go, and to the death of his beloved Trinity.  But it was her time anyway.  Nevertheless the movie allowed us to know that Neo died in body but he can exist outside of his body in the Matrix.  Now the cycle can begin all over again.  But what changed.  The equation that The Architect had been trying to solve.  The choice that we have, to stay in the Matrix or awaken from it and join the human race in Zion.  I think what most people wanted was to see the machines fall forever.  A plesant, and comforting thought, but not the way things work.  I think Neo has an even greater battle ahead.

The action and adventure aspect of revolutions is right on the mark. During the main battle sequences the action was impressive. But often it was cheapened by the inclusion of characters you really felt no connection too. Often the Wachowski's reverted to action/sci-fi stereotypes for their characters. These stereotypes where so blatant that one wonders if the Wachowski's were trying to play to certain groups.
Another theme that is played out is the whole idea of ""the one"" or some messianic figure like Neo being crucified like Jesus Christ. It's sad that so much philosophy used in the first Matrix was completely lost in this final movie. We all knew that Neo was ""the one,"" but then to realize that there were other Neo's before him; it left the door open for a whole relm of posibilities and they chose the most obvious one.
I am not sure if this movie was catered to a specific audience for revenue or to plug some up coming online game (Matrix Online), or purhaps a comic book but this movie is a disappointment in the end.
I wouldn't suggest buying this movie on DVD or VHS unless you absolutely MUST have a completed set. (...)I really wish is was worth more but frankly the movie was fun to watch but not mind expanding in the least.",1068076800,2,1443,4.596899224806202

The action scenes are just long enough to be absolutely amazing, without getting redundant (Except perhaps the last fight scene).  The battle in Zion is far more interesting than I ever could have imagined (After being in the Matrix, I would of thought reality would be boring.. not so).  The intensity is such that the visuals and story become literally jaw dropping, as was my state during about 1/3rd of the movie.  There are some painful drama scenes, and is it just me or is no one entertained by Trinity's and Neo's fake relationship?  No matter, the positives of this movie are so grand that the negatives can not hold the movie down enough to be anything less than a success.  There are still some deep comments here, but they are hidden deeper than were the messages in the first Matrix.  Perhaps a few more viewings are in order.
This movie has moments of pure beauty, drama, action, and humor that will surely be worth the price of admission.  And when it's over, you'll be craving another viewing of the first two movies too.",1068076800,3,1212,4.522935779816514

To follow it correctly you need to have seen every aspect of the story in the Animatrix, The Matrix, Reloaded, Enter the Matrix(Game), Revolutions. What a finish! The story is extremely deep and the action is awesome. This final movie left me feeling fulfilled and amazed. This story is about love, trust and belief in the greater good.

1893750,5,B00009W2GQ,"I've just come from seeing Revolutions and the only thing I can think to say is, ""WOW!"" It's been a long time since I was so gripped by a movie. The Matrix Revolutions really grabs you and doesn't let go.
The film was honestly better then I expected, and I had high expectations. But to be fair, this really is a film for those who have invested in the first two films of the series. It's not enough to simply have seen the first two films, but a decent comprehension of the underlying themes (especially those presented in Reloaded) is necessary to really take away all Revolutions has to offer.
This film picks up exactly where Reloaded left off. The first 30-minutes or so is all drama and dialogue without any action whatsoever. I've heard complaints about this, but it really is necessary to set up what is to come. Once all that's done with, and the various characters set out on their various paths, the movie is all down hill. That is to say, like the drop on a rollercoaster, not that it loses quality. Indeed, you may feel your stomach in your chest as the intensity builds to levels rarely seen in movies before.
Unlike the previous Matrix films, this film rarely takes place within that artificial reality. This is a film about humanity, specifically those in Zion, and their last battle against the Machines. Even Neo, the savior of humanity, has less screen time than in either of the previous two films. In Revolutions we finally see Neo for what he represents to mankind rather than simply an all powerful ""super man"" character. In Revolutions we understand that Neo is a savior not because of what he ""can"" do, but because of what he ""choosess"" to do.
The film's two set pieces feature an epic battle between Zionists and the sentinel army that is so epic that it defies understanding, and a final showdown between Neo and his adversary, Smith who's grown even more powerful than Neo. Undoubtedly these two scenes will be the highlight of many mainstream goers, and certainly they are worth the price of admission alone just to see. But the real power to this film is in the ending that is sure to leave many people scratching their heads.
It's unfortunate that many people will likely be confused by the film's ending, but those who've been following along will come to realize that it is the only conclusion that is really possible. It's extremely difficult to talk about this film without spoiling it, but let's just say that the Wachowski's definately understand that kicking butt, even though it looks cool, is not what makes a hero.
The Matrix Revolutions is much different in style and story than the original Matrix, but it is also the perfect conclusion to what happens after Neo hangs up the phone at the end of the first film.",1068076800,,2754,4.622448979591836

please don't judge the film on the ending which made no sence wat so ever!! the film up to that was one of the best matrix's i have ever seen maybe not at good as the first but better then reloaded!!
dont give up on the  matrix yet so it was a bad ending ok that destoryed the whole 3 films and personal i wanted neo to take over the matrix or something and trinity dieing was out of order but thats the way things are and we cant change it now!!!

Honestly I think most of you don't give Matrix Revolutions the credit is deserves and you guys are even giving bad reviews to Matrix Reloaded. I went to the very first showing at 6am and I actaully saw the movies twice on opening day.  The visual effects are absolutely amazing, the 3rd installment fills in everything that was missing from the 2nd movie, and the fight scenes in this last installment were very inventive and choreagraphed very well. But this may not be the last movie in the series (myself and many others hope not) because the Wachowski brothers conlcluded the war, but they left it open to other installments. Yes, even though our be-loved Trinity dies just means that it gave Neo more of a reason to fight and defeat Agent Smith. Every great story (fiction or non-fiction) involves tragedy.  This is why Trinity dies.  This movie has fullfilled all my expectations and I am very satisfied with how it was portrayed.  I recommend this movie to all who are Matrix or sci-fi fans.  This is my favorite sci-fi series of all time. Star wars is a total bomb since the newest installments.

1893758,5,B00009W2GQ,"I will try and review this without giving away too much of the story line. I had an appointment with a friend to go see the movie this coming Friday, but when I walked past the cinemas yesterday, I just could not wait that long.
The movie starts of at a relatively sedated pace without any answers to the sudden twist at the end of Reloaded. But if you are an action fan, don't worry, it picks up. And you get relatively straightforward answers.
The movie mostly starts out in the matrix and then moves to the real world and the city of Zion. The action builds up to the fever pitch battle for Zion.
Some other reviewers think their questions were answered and others leave with more questions than answers. I feel it is an honestly good movie, with an end that you could not foresee and that you have to watch at least a second time to get more answers than questions. I for one like it that way.
It is a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat with action sequences, plot spinning and an end that keeps you guessing. I will still honour my appointment to go see it (again) this coming Friday.",1068076800,,1100,4.242857142857143

Thought the second one was a good example of what happens when a filmaker(x2) is handed too much money... and the third? Most people on this site have a better grasp of writing than the twits that spun this monstrosity. Yes, pretty to look at. Yes, I've grown fond of Morpheus, Trinity and Neo... but if the Matrix (Original) was a sci-fi fan's dream come true, this trash represents what a good sci-fi fan hates: limited vision and imagination. A saga? Yes, if you decide to stick to what you saw possible after seeing the first one. Let your own imagination show you what could have been...

1893760,1,B00009W2GQ,"Too much describes several aspects to the finale of the overrated Matrix trilogy.  Too much hype.  Too much philosophy.  Too many special effects.  Too much money spent to go see the movie- as the Wachowski brothers were way over their heads with this one.  ""The Matrix Revolutions"" solved perhaps 5% of the questions brought forth from the previous movies.  The problem arose after the first movie- they should have just stopped right there.  The second movie contained too many new characters, theories, and philosophical/theological topics and references.  In doing this, they raised the bar of expectations for the final movie to a level that the brothers could not hope to reach.  Several key characters make brief appearances at best, and the new ones introduced have no major purpose after the scene in which they first appear.  On the plus side, the fight scenes (which were few and far between) were phenomenal, and the special effects were unbelievable.  Unfortunately, the positive factors end there.  No closure was brought forth when the credits started to roll, and everyone in the theater breathed a sigh of relief when the doors opened.  The bottom line is, don't waste your money on this one, and if you haven't seen ""Matrix Reloaded"" don't bother to, just enjoy the breakthrough film that was the first Matrix.",1068076800,5,1328,5.0091324200913245
1893761,1,B00009W2GQ,"This review contains spoilers but it's nothing you couldn't figure out from the first 20 minutes of the movie anyway.
 A student of mine told me that his friend at Warner Bros. said that this was terrible so I can't say that I wasn't warned.
 Oh boy, where to begin.  First off, I should mention the good stuff.  The battle between the machines and the humans, who are using other machines to fight the invading machines, is loads of fun.  If only the attack had occurred during the pointless orgy scene in ""Reloaded"".better yet, but I digress.  Suffice to say that any movie made by Bros. W., Spielberg or Lucas will always look great.  The action is good, now, does it really matter?  Also, Hugo Weaving is acting circles around the rest of the cast.
 Unfortunately, there are just too many scenes in this movie from other movies as well as the first two installments of this one.  Let's see here:  Bullets in slo-mo? Check.  Dance/orgy scene? Check.  Resurrection of a major character at the climax?  Check.  Signature John Woo scene of all the characters in a room pointing guns at each other?  Check.  Dudes in military exoskeletons a la ""Robotech?""  Check.  Monica Bellucci's breasts squeezed in a so-tight-it-just-can't-be-good-for-her-circulation bustier?  Check.
 The plot (which I will not discuss here) is pretty much pro-forma, not only can you see the story coming a mile away you even know what the characters are going to say before they say anything.  (But you knew I was going to type that didn't you?)  The dialogue is laughably bad for most of the first (as well as the second and last) portions of the film.  The scene in the train station with Neo and a family is unintentionally hilarious.  The writers seem to have reduced Neo's intelligence just below that of Homer Simpson, and for a character played by Keanu Reeves that's saying something.  The scene in the ship where an Agent Smith possessed character is talking to Neo was laughable.  (Hint to Neo: Only the bad guys greet you with ""Hel-lo Mis-ter An-derson).  As much as I derided ""Reloaded"" I was mildly surprised by the scene with the architect, unfortunately, there are really no surprises here.
 Some scenes are so bad I'm amazed that they made it into the film.  There is a shoot out that is a direct rip off of the first movie.  The scene in the gay bar/dance club/S&M hangout is actually WORSE than the Zion scene in ""Reloaded.""  Why the Merovingian would open a gay bar when he's married to Monica Bellucci is a question well worth pondering.  Also, seeing men in latex pointing guns at Trinity and Morpheus isn't threatening, it's funny.  The Merovingian must now join Jar-Jar Binks in the ranks of the movie characters with hilariously, annoying accents.  Why he is even in this movie is a question well worth pondering.  (To the fan boys who are screaming that ""He's really Hades!"" I know but Hades is god of the dead, not the god of Purgatory.)  The death scene with Trinity was FUNNY!  I mean, she's having this conversation with Neo and the camera suspiciously does not show her torso so you can figure that she's become ""Trinity-ka-bob,"" but NO, when the camera finally does show her torso she's been skewered six ways from Sunday and yet still has enough life left in her to hold for a scene that goes on WAY too long.  (Second hint to Neo: Kissing dying ""Trinity-ka-bobs"" only hastens the inevitable.)  Now that she's out of the way, Neo goes on to meet Big Giant Head (or the leader of the machines who/whatever that is.)  So, Neo now needs to ""jack-in"" (I sure hope that William Gibson is getting some kind of kick-back for all the raping the Bros. W. have done of his work) one last time to fight guess who?
 If you've seen the first two parts, you know.  Needless to say, that their fight scene is a replay of their fight scene in part one except without the suspense.  Neo dies YET AGAIN and THIS time he's brought back by Big Giant Head.  Again, him dying MIGHT have meant something if not for the fact that nobody important stays dead in these movies.
 This might have meant something if we felt more for the characters but we don't.  I think that Morpheus was the most interesting part of the first film but he is literally wasted in the sequels.  I didn't think that he was any closer to Neo than he was in the first film.  Indeed, they had more scenes together in the first installment.  Ditto for Neo's relationship with Trinity, they love each other.  So what?  I felt no sadness at her passing for the mere reason that their relationship never seemed to grow nor matter.  ""Lord of the Rings"" is a great story not only for the action but because it's easy to CARE about the characters.  Tolkein was a philologist and he knew that words meant more than their everyday, common usages.  Words have histories, so did his characters.
 Finally, the score manages to rip-off BOTH ""Mars"" from Holst's The Planets as well as Orff's ""Carmina Burana.""
 If you're up for some nice fight scenes and don't give a rip about character development, go ahead and see ""Revolotions,"" but I'd recommend a couple of Coronas first.",1067990400,42,5118,4.618201997780244
1893762,4,B00009W2GQ,"The apocalyptic finale of the Matrix epic--it is exactly what I had expected it to be. Though it does not set a CGI benchmark like the original Matrix, it is much better than Reloaded and brings the story to a satisfactory conclusion. Dont get me wrong--the CGI is mindblowing yet you do get a sense of deja vu when you see the movie--unlike the original Matrix theres nothing new here which you haven't seen before. Also I felt there were quite a few elements from the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings in the main structure of the movie--I don't want to give away any plot details so I don't get into the parallels--if you have seen the movie you know what I am talking about.
But the plus point is the story--it is a beautiful, thoughtprovoking ending which true to the Matrix tradition remains bound to mystical Eastern(predominantly Hindu) ideas of the ""end"" and ""beginning"". It was also nice to see the Matrix pay tribute to the Hindu ideas of ""maya"", ""karma"" ""trinayan(mind's eye)"" and ""srishti"" (creation) by introducing a Hindu girl in a pivotal ""oracle"" role. Matrix needed to end on a bang and yes I can say that it did.
Yes the movie will be criticized. People expect new standards of CGI with each matrix and these viewers may feel let down. But for guys like me who want to look upon Revolutions as a movie and as a finale to an epic rather than as a showcase for the latest graphics tricks, there is nothing to complain. The movie can also be criticized for not closing some of the big debates of the role of the Architect and such---but I am sure the geeks will have some gigantic interpretation out soon. In any case Reloaded went too heavy on the metaphysical stuff and lost the audience somewhere down the road. Revolutions restores balance--they keep it mystically heavy but don't slam your head with conundrums--after all this is a movie not an algebra test !
My greatest criticism is that the movie gets too maudlin at times with protracted death scenes and mushy dialogue. And there were too many love stories inserted as side plots which detracts from the main stream of the story. But at least we didn't have anything like the ecstacy-induced group sex thing we sat through in Reloaded---thank the Architect for small mercies !
Performancewise the Matrix series has never been one to write home about. Keanu Reeves pulls out his stock expressions which run the gamut from a to b while the rest of the cast performs in a standard fashion. Only exception is the scene-stealing Hugo Weaving as Mr Smith----now he kicks some bigtime butt--crackling the screen with his deadpan expression and knuckle-gnashing dialogue delivery.
In conclusion, Matrix Revolutions is a more-than satisfactory conclusion to the Matrix story---maybe it lacks that sparkle that elevates a movie to motion picture greatness but it satisfies and gives you your moneys worth ! Now for how many movies can you say that ?",1067990400,7,2917,4.710371819960861

But revolutions is simply, one of the worst conclusion of a trilogy ever!!!!
the story got so dumb and uninspired that the couldn't manage to keep it firm and it went way out of hand. the first hour and a half of the film, there's hardly any action, but stupid dialogue that was so repetituos that leaded nowhere!!! And it wasn't just me, even my very best matrix die hard friends were deeply frustated!! The oracle was so bad this time that first I thought it was ajoke...how can she be so mystirious and still couldn't help neo in anything...then the film goes into a animated battle so cheesy it was dumb!!!!! and the ending could be easyly the worst ever!!!! After this film, I think is going to be very hard for reaves to find a job....because he has proven in this one that he really can't act!!! the movie was plain awfull!!!!!! in every aspect!",1067990400,7,1168,4.387096774193548

As far as my take, It has to be when the Oracle tells Neo that he and Agent Smith are one and the same, exact opposites of each other.  I think that the reason Agent Smith dies at the end is because in order to keep the balance of both of their existence, Neo's sacrifice of himself to save the people (no need to tell you about the religious undertones here) ultimatley kills Agent Smith as well, because Neo's existence had to balance out Agent Smiths existence.  (Im gonna have to watch this again...and again, and again)
The War scence in Zion was magnificent...and had the whole theater cheering at its close(I remember the frustration I felt was so real when the second wave of machines made they're way through...not to mention the end fight scene between Agent Smith and Neo was absolutely brilliant...
There are many religious undertones to the conclusion of this movie, mainly dealing with faith(Oracle's belief in Neo,
christianity/judaism/islam (Ressurection of Neo and his sacrifice for his people) and even some Hinduism (the belief of reincarnation, much like the recreation of the Matrix six times) and lets throw some good old Kharma into the mix for good measure.

Although the movie targets general public with rather ""easy"" scenes and a quite ""acceptable"" end, there is more than that behind the Matrix.  A good *entertainment* movie usually brings the auditory into a stagnant state where they brutishly watch action scenes, comfortably in their stuffed seat, totally lacking any cerebral activity besides pleasure.  In Matrix Revolutions, the Wachowski Brothers force the auditory to go beyond easy entertainment and incredible CGI animations and actually DISCUSS about the movie once it is over.  I guess they were not afraid to answer ALL questions; neither did they leave holes for future sequels.

1893772,3,B00009W2GQ,"Matrix I was a triumph of the marriage between a Hong Kong style kungfu fu flick and the typical Hollywood blockbuster. It had jaw-dropping action sequences and CGI effects that blew everybody away and set the standard for future CGI-infused thrillers. What made it so memorable was that it had a story, a plot and a concept all neatly rolled into one. It was so engaging that by the time the credits were rolling, you almost wanted to cry of relief that you're still in the real world and at the same time pray that the Matrix doesn't really exist.
Fast forward to November 2003 and here we are at the screening of the final chapter of the Matrix trilogy. After the debacle that was Matrix Reloaded, expectations are high as the W brothers try to redeem themselves with a bang of an ending. To be fair, M3 is better than M2. Much better. The CGIs are still quite breathtaking albeit less explosive, and there is actually a semblance of a plot this time round. Gone is the technobabble that threatened to sink M2. In its place is simple logic and heart which leads us to an inevitable showdown between Neo and Smith(s).
Sadly, there is minimal character development and the lead actors are pretty much left to their own devices to try and spice things up with whatever dismal lines that they are given. In fact Neo and gang actually disappear halfway through the show leaving only the CGI sentinels to salvage whatever dignity this trilogy had. As a result, nothing of importance really happens until the final half hour of the movie and by then you would've stopped caring for whomever it was that survived the invasion.
Finally, the way they wrapped it up is inconclusive, messy and totally not worth all the trouble the original writers took to create an alternative reality and fate. Which begets the question: How did something which started out so well end up so bad?",1067990400,13,1873,4.627627627627628

1893775,5,B00009W2GQ,"Quite simply, films do not get better than this.  As a die-hard fan of the Matrix trilogy, it was of course my prerogative to enjoy this film.  However, my father, whom I saw Revolutions with, also enjoyed this film.
First off, the acting.  While many say that Keanu Reeves is not, despite the incredible movies he stars in, a good actor.  Lies!  He gives a performance of a lifetime in Revolutions.  His acting abilities alone would make me want to see this movie more that five times.  Coupling that with the enchanting performances given by Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Jada Pinkett-Smith, you have an acting combination that would make any film wonderful.
But that is not all, no! that is not all.  The soundtrack adds a depth and flavor to the film that ties everything together and makes the drama so much more, well, dramatic.  This film would not have been complete without the angelic voices singing in the background while Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Smith (Hugo Weaving) battle it out in their final confrontation.
Finally, the plot provided the perfect finisher to an incredible series.  I don't wish to reveal anything to anyone who has yet to see the movie, but suffice to say that everything is tied up perfectly with just enough doubt to let the moviegoer use their own imagination.
This film will be wonderful for romantics and sci-fi geeks alike.  So bring the kids!  Bring the neighbors!  Bring your aunt Sally!  Whoever you take with you, they are bound to enjoy the final chapter of the Matrix saga: Matrix Revolutions.",1067990400,6,1562,4.801498127340824
1893776,3,B00009W2GQ,"Being a huge fan of the Matrix trilogy, I saw the Matrix Revolutions, the final chapter in the trilogy, opening day. One word can describe it: disappointment. The hype must have gotten to me, because what I anticipated to be a ""whoa"" turned out to be a ""uh"". This movie was very confusing in many area's. Picking up where Reloaded, the second in the series, left off, we find our heroes aboard a ship with Neo and Agent Smith as a human in a coma. This is where it starts to get confusing. Without giving too much of the plot away, Neo is trapped in a world between the human world and the Matrix. It makes no sense, and there is no explanation as to just where and what this is, and how he is there without being plugged into anything. From there it's pretty straight forward. This would be fine if it had an engaging original story. No, not even close. Where Reloaded gained strength from it's weak story was the awesome visual effects which were no less than jaw dropping. However, Revolutions does not contain much action, it's mostly talk. The action it does have is awesome, I'll give it that. When the machines finally do burrow through to Zion the human resistance, mainly robots, fight them off, and this brings amazing special effects. That scene was almost 15 minutes long, and exciting every minute. However, there are only two really good action scenes in the movie. The final fight with Agent Smith was pretty good, but a bit on the short side. So Revolutions has no story nor an abundance of eye candy, so what will make people want to see it? Well, it's the conclusion to the Matrix. This alone should bring in hordes of people anxious to see Neo's fate. The conclusion to the Matrix was a decent one, if not a little clich. However, they just don't know when to stop. The end was fine, leave it at that. The last 5 minutes open it for a sequel and in my opinion, ruin the whole movie. Now, it doesn't imply a sequel, or tell you like Reloaded did, it just leaves on open, instead of closing the trilogy for good. As big of a fan of the Matrix as I am, I would have liked to see it closed here. It is done, over, finished. So basically the Matrix Revolutions is a mindless story without a lot of visual effects. The story it does attempt to have is confusing at best, and it leaves alot of questions unanswered. Matrix fans should definitely see this as it does end it to an extent, but anyone who hasn't seen Reloaded should steer clear, it was confusing enough for us who knew.",1067990400,32,2495,4.367741935483871
1893777,4,B00009W2GQ,"The action sequences and graphic effects in The Matrix Revolutions were good but not path-breaking - among others, the previous Matrixes, Lord of the Rings, and The Star Wars prequels have already done it. Other movie formula ingredients - comedy, romance, tragedy, drama (also know as inter-personnel relationships) - are all present to various extents. Like any commercial movie, many questions are left deliberately unanswered, leaving open the possibility for sequels and prequels. Down one star.
Humor is certainly present in Revolutions, though not very much and not often obvious. For one that is (or should be) obvious, watch when Neo's punch to Agent Smith is caught close-up in slow motion, Rocky fashion. In Rocky (and Raging Bull), you see one boxer's glove smashing into the other's chin in slow motion, the jaw distorting, sweat and blood flying. You get the adrenalin rush as you feel the impact on your own fist (or your jaw, depending on your imagination). In Revolutions, Smith's face contorts in slow motion - itself a funny sight. Then Smith's head moves away from Neo's fist, revealing four knuckles briefly imprinted on the cheek from the impact. Hilarious.
But it is in philosophy where, in my opinion, Revolutions really scores.
I collect pop philosophy in short pithy sentences. Ancient Vedic philosophy from India is great at this: ""I am the Ultimate Reality,"" ""You are That (Ultimate Reality),"" ""There's one Truth, but the wise call it by different names"" and so on.
The Matrix Revolutions, which shows the influence of the Vedas in many places, has a few gems of its own to add (though not necessarily original), like ""Everything that has a beginning has an end"" and ""Cookies, like everything else, need a lot of love and affection.""
It explains the ancient Vedic concept of Karma - the law of actions and results - in two short dialogues: ""Cause-Effect and Action-Consequences as opposed to Chance or Coincidence"" and ""What Love and Karma mean to a Computer Program.""
The meaning of life and purpose of existence is hinted at by statements that are obviously supposed to be the opposite, because they are made by Agent Smith - an obvious villain - and by good people sunk in despair or hopelessness.
Mercifully, none of the philosophizing was as long as some of the painful discourses in the previous movie, The Matrix Reloaded.
As a suitable finale, the lyrics of the song that played during the credits are in Sanskrit:
  ""Asato maa sad gamaya. Tamaso maa jyotir gamaya. Mrityor maa amritan gamaya""
They are from the Vedas, and mean ""Take me from falsehood (or unreal) to the truth (or reality), from darkness to light, from death to immortality.""
As they say in Hindi to the whole concept of the universe, ""Sab Maya Hai"" - Everything is an Illusion - like the Matrix.",1067990400,11,2799,4.915433403805497
1893778,4,B00009W2GQ,"I'm a devoted fan of the Matrix and I was very exicited for the release of the concluding Revolutions sequel. The movie brings together the entire cast and utilizes teamwork in the epic battle to save Xion and its people from complete destruction from the machines. The plot is once again in full throttle with new twists and turns and eye-boggling special effects. Certain disappointments such as the death of one of the main characters (I won't mention the name so it doesn't spoil the movie) is used for emotional relief, similar to the approach used in Star Trek: Nemesis when Data died. Much goes un-answered throughout the film such as who this large orb with spikes coming out of it is, and if Neo actually survives all remains an enigma. I feel obligated to reveal a primary part of the plot to people pondering on whether it's worth to see it in the theater. Instead of giving the audience what they expected- the end of the war and the end of the machines' rule over humans, we get a lame ""Peace"" status to be maintained between the machines and humans. The ending is an insult to the devoted fans that anticipated the final defeat of the machines and for humans to take back control of Earth. One might cite from the Anti-matrix that we in fact struck first on the machines and never gave them a chance to have even when they wanted peace. However, AI was a mistake and the machines went too far and striking back was only logical. It's ironic that peace was finally obtained after so many had to die/be enslaved and the Earth had to be scorched.

I felt it was so well done, so philisophical and action - packed with a purpose, because people's lives are at stake in this movie.  People die, and this movie was such a well made and emotionally elevating movie i just completely fell for it (even some scenes in the beginning were forgivable).  Over all this movie is an astounding acheivement as a parralel to our world today.  I recommend it to all, but be warned, i went with several people to see this movie, and i was the only one there to truly understand the final 10 minutes.

Granted, the effects are impressive.  The fight scenes, though far fewer in this film, are well done and loaded with adrenaline.  Neo's and Smith's evolving powers are used to their fullest in the final battle.  And the battle in Zion is equally impressive, with thousands of Zionites in battle robots fending off an attack by a horde of Sentinel robots.  Unfortunately, as impressive as these things are, they have all been seen before.  And therein lies the glaring fault with Revolutions - it's all been done before.  In the previous films, the storyline was as engrossing as the effects, and the result was a series that continually fresh and groundbreaking.  Revolutions serves up great effects, but lacks the storyline needed to make it a complete movie.  The few twists that do show up in the movie are mostly predictable, especially if you have been paying attention to the previews.

success clearly went to the wachowskis' heads, and enough depth wasn't there to justify the added attention.  it is hard to blame the actors in this case.  it's obvious everyone wanted to recreate the impact they had had with matrix 1, yet it just didn't happen (matrix2 & 3 do not even rank).

Finally a movie that strives to be something more than a tool to separate us from our money.  I've spent the last few hours thinking about revolutions, and the more i follow the path of the characters and the plot of the trilogy, the more connections i see...  and the more everything makes sense.  What goes around comes around, as they say. Not everything is answered of course, but that's half the point!  Consider it a puzzle, and you've gotta find a few of the pieces yourself.  Some people aren't gonna bother, and that's their choice, but really that's what it all comes down to anyway:  Choice.  THERE IS A POINT TO ALL THIS!  A MESSAGE!  And a good one, i think.  Every choice made by every character has an effect - as the Merovingian says.  If any of the main characters had not listened to their heart and choosen for self-preservation or cowardice or greed or whatever instead, the ripple effects from that small decision could have doomed them all.  If the 'marine-drill-sargeant' character hadn't trusted his instincts and let the 16 yr-old help, think of the consequences!  Or if Link's girl hadn't choosen to stay and help?  And there are endless examples of this in the trilogy.  The future of zion, and our future as well, depends not only on the decisions we make as a people but on those everyday decisions we make as individuals as well.

My worst fear was the it wouldn't answer all the questions it set up in Reloaded.

In the first act, Neo visits the Oracle and asks her why he could stop the Sentinals at the end of Reloaded. She answers him in a very plain and simple fashion that only a fool wouldn't understand.
Nearly all the other questions are answered as well, if perhaps sometimes in a more subtle manner.
The brothers set up the trilogy in the very first episode to have Neo play the role of the Savior, and they follow through all the way - pulling no stops!

Visually, the moive is absolutely amazing. The battle for Zion is spectacular and the final Smith vs. Neo fight was amazing. But the first Matrix movie didn't make millions because of fight sequences, but because of the thought-provoking theory of the Matrix.
The purpose of these two films was to introduce and resolve the real story of the Matrix. I enjoyed the story from Enter the Matrix (the video game) better than this.

If it wasn't for the few great scenes that Trinity, Niobe, and Z get I would be disapointed beyond belief. There was about 30 minutes of film that deserved four stars and the rest didn't deserve even 1. I just keep thinking I went to a theatre as dawn for this!

This installment does nothing but dodge around the meaning of the sequels.  I thought that they were there to show how humans would put an end to the machine world and become the dominant beings.  Yet instead you leave the theater with an empty feeling.  Very empty as the film takes the lives of those who matter the most in the fight for freedom.

Having that said, let me say this:  ""Why the sunrise?  Why?""
Outside of that, this movie is way better then Reloaded.  I saw the Matrix back in mid to late 90's, in the theatre.  Reloaded was a long awaited sequel, which in my opinion, sucked at first but does grow on you.  Revolutions, while still leaving the door open for a sequel (or prequel ?) was indeed a definite conclusion to the trilogy that rose above my expectations of what I thought it would be.  What did I think it would be?  A great idea killed by a big budget studio going for the dollar.
What was the actual movie like?  Suspenseful as al hell, gritty (yes, good guys do die),  eerie (waves of squidies) and dedicated to the original idea of machine conquering man and the complicated relationship between humans and the machines.  It goes deeper, way deep in terms of the survival & dependency of each life form on the other.
The final battle between Neo and Agent Smith was epic. Great dramatic ""slomos"", silhouetted kung-fu moves and superhero flights over the city. I felt like I was watching Godzilla battles Mothra, Optimus Prime versus Megatron, or for that matter, Tron versus the MCP.
One of the more memorable moments of the film that inspires us to keep following the plot:  when we gain a glimpse the earth above the scorched sky...a reminder of what life must have beeen like before the machines started growing us.

I believe in the chain theory, that there are several Matrixes in the system. This would validate how he can excist in the ""real world"".
The reason the programer was surprised was because he choose Trinity in front of destroying the matrix. I think The One, the program, has evolved and developped feelings, something that is unknown to the rest of the program. So, in the end, it is the love that saves us!

Anyway, the way I see, the theory of Neo evolving into ""something"" that destroys the matrix world is more than likely, and the effect will probably be destructive and claiming many lives, the death of all these people in the matrix world (not zion) will cause them to either wake up or die leaving Zion on its own to rebiuld the human race again.  However, questions of Neo's parents and what happened to the last ""One"" are explained in the new film I can reveal, but from what I know the last ""One"" had a choice to pull the ""plug"" on the matrix but chose not to due to socio political reasons, ie free will leads to war, famine, corruption, etc. The endin is philisophical, and the hint of matrix within a matrix is made.

When Smith is intergating Morpheus. Smith tells him i must get free zion is the key now if he was a program made to hunt and kill any awaken human how would he be free. When Neo Gets shot by smith and dies his powers really come into play can we say mabye when neo killed smith his true self came into play mabye
since the humans have the one mabye the machines do as well.
In matrix reloaded there are servial clues take it for instance
all the rouge programs if the machines had total control wouldnt
they be able to just erase them at will??And when Smith knocks
on the door and asks for neo when they say they don't know him
he hands his jack in plug to them and says tell him thank you
for setting me free. Smith and his hell bent desire to
destroy and take over as many as he can mabye he rather not exist

The humans actually beat the machines and to keep them at bay, the human created the Matrix for the Machines. So, Neo, Trinity, every other person is actually an AI hooked up to the Matrix. Now, I haven't even thought about how this is possible or if there are clues in the movie to support this, but it sure would be an interesting, Sixth Sense, type of twist. I'll need to go back and watch the Matrix and wait for Reloaded to come out on DVD to see if this theory holds any water.
The multiple matrix theory is getting tiring. I think it does hold water and may be the best theory, but I'd be a bit disappointed. It would seem like a copout. Of course, this is my personal theory:
The final battle between Neo and Agent Smith is on screen. The fight is amazing. The special effects are like nothing ever seen. Then, as Neo is about to die....We see Mr. Anderson asleep at his desk in his cube. He jerks awake and says, ""Whoa!"" Then a FedEx guy come up behind him and says, ""Thomas Anderson?"" Cut to black...Rage Against the Machine Music....",1062720000,2,1239,4.344827586206897
1893802,5,B00009W2GQ,"The problem with just about every theory i've heard is that they assume that what we've heard so far is correct. Remember, this is the matrix trilogy. In the first film we learned that the reality we live in is actually built for humans, ruled by machines.
who is to say that the machines won the war in the first place?
for those who have seen the animatrix, they saw a world where a machine entered a private matrix. who is to say that the robots really won the war? here's what i think happened:
the humans won the war, and the machines, now sentient, wanted to be humans. so, every human inside the matrix is actually a machine. the people we see that work for the matrix are actually humans, trying to regulate what occurs in the fantasy world of the matrix. what we see as the real world is just a facade and another layer of the matrix.
in the first film, smith called humanity a virus. well, isn't he looking awful virus-like at the moment? email me with your thoughts about this, i am eager to discuss it.",1062028800,,1014,4.31413612565445
1893803,5,B00009W2GQ,"I saw the first matrix and I was like ""whoa"" now that was tight. Then I saw matix reloaded and I was like was like I wanna stay and watch it again. Matrix 3 hasn't come out yet but im pretty sure Im gonna be like wow when is this on dvd cause when it comes out that suckers mine. If you watch matrix 2 all the way through ....even the credits you get to see a preview of matrix 3 and that blows me away. I heard all you talking about amatrix within a matrix and you get me confused. Although matrix 2 got me confused if neo was still plugged into the matrix if the sentinels died how come neo didn't die .....could he possibly,truly be the one if he is I can understand if hes still alive. I think that niobes crew set off an EMP and destroyed the sentinels...but how could neo live.....I don't know. Maybe what wasn't shown was neo getting unplugged from the matrix. Was he in the real world.....I don't really know. All I know is that matrix 3 is gonna ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1061942400,,989,4.238095238095238
1893804,5,B00009W2GQ,"I think whoever wrote the review before this is on the right track about Neo's powers outside the matrix.  The idea of another ship's EMP is stupid, and a matrix within a matrix is just going to get boring and repetitive.  If there's one thing I've learned form watching Reloaded, its that the Wachowski bros. are definitely fans of anime, and theory of Neo evolving to some new level (most likely from his coming face-to-face with the architect) is very much in the plot style of anime.  Having been in the central ""command room"" of the matrix, it is possible that his brain may now be in tune with the signals that control the sentinels and other machines.
There's another factor in play here.  Many of the computer entities (Merovingian, Architect, etc.) keep going on about causality, and how they basically know everything that will ever happen because it's all cause-and-effect.  I've studied causality in college, and this is where Smith is going to become a key factor in how all of this will play out.  As an out-of-control rogue program, he is the only factor the Architect and his ""minions"" never took into account (funny how he called the humans a virus only to become one himself).  Whether it will ultimately be for good or ill I do not know, but I have a strong feeling that whetever happens next is going to hinge upon the actions of Smith.",1060992000,39,1356,4.625
1893805,5,B00009W2GQ,"I actually believe that Agent Smith and the ""multiple matrix"" theories can both hold water. In the beginning of The Matrix Reloaded, didn't anybody even notice the ""multiple galaxies"" of matrix code (and the cool looking giant gear)? I thought this would be a good enough hint, but apparently not many people feel that this is an important part of the movie. Also, listen closely to The Architect's speech at the end of The Matrix Reloaded. He says that if Neo is to walk through the door leading back to the Matrix, it will ""result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everything connected to the Matrix."" Doesn't anybody else think that he's talking about Smith? Smith takes over people's bodies when he multiplies, so these people die right? After all, Neo himself said it ""felt like dying."" This is what I believe, anyway. However, I hate to disappoint most of you when I tell you that Neo most likely will not bring about the destruction of the Matrix. Why not? Simply because they're coming out with a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (The Matrix Online) next year... and they've even said the game ""takes place inside the Matrix after the end of The Matrix Revolutions.""",1059436800,5,1192,4.79126213592233
1893806,5,B00009W2GQ,"Theories of exectly why Neo has the ability to use his power outside the Matrix have surfaced so I'm here to offer mine or possibly just to discredit others. Some say that it wasn't Neo who stopped the machine and that it was a nearby ship's EMP. I discredit this for two reasons. First, if it was an EMP, why did Neo pass out. Secondly, I don't believe Larry and Andy would do that. Leave people mystified for six months about how Neo can use his powers in the real world then tell us in the third movie that he can't and it was just another ships EMP. Another theory is that the real world is not actually a real world but another simulation like the matrix and that the matrix is actually a matrix within a matrix. I liked this theory but again I don't believe Larry and Andy would do that. It would seem too much like a lame twist added just to be another twist. I won't say it's not possible, but I would say it's unlikely. So what's my theory? I don't quite have one yet. I'm taking a watch and wait stance.

1893807,5,B00009W2GQ,"I do believe that the Wachowski brothers have A LOT of surprises in their little bag of plot-twists and turns, so I will completely bypass the obligatory - ""there are nested Matrices!"" comments.
Anywho, to disprove a previous theory written on this very page, if the sentinels had a 'fail-safe' against destroying the anomoly, they never would've fired the bomb that destroyed the Nebuchadnezzar(hence killing Neo).",1057708800,,415,5.303030303030303
1893808,5,B00009W2GQ,"I have seen Reloded manytimes and have my own theories. I don't think they are living inj a chain matrix, as its a common imagination, and would ruin the plot. We have to understand that machines don't have a sensory system like us, that even their vision is defined in a machine language. Thus the mind of the machine itself may be somehow connected to the matrix, which means when Neos physical form is sensored, its decoded to his residual self image within the mind of the machine, resulting in the anamoly. The sight of Neo and his actions in real world is decoded into the machine brain, and is converted into his residual self image inside the Sentinnels brain, and since Neos residual self image is an anamoly, it can crash the sentinnels, even if it means that Neo lacks any direct power in the real world? get it?
Thats one Theory. the other is, the machines do not want to kill the anamoly, since the failure to get him into the source will result in a cataclysmic crash killing everyone plugged into the matrix. Eventhough the archetech didn't panic when neo went through the other door, the machines may not be prepared to take steps in the event all crops died. The test subjects died in the first two matrixes, but I believe that it was at a smaller scale and didn't involve billions of crops. If humans are extinct , machines may not have asn alternative energy source, and because of this, the higher order machines probably triggered some kind of a suicidal emp in those squiddys to deactivate them before they destroyed Neo, in which case it was a mere coincidence.  Enter the Matrix game has revealed the reason why Neo is in a coma. His mind is now seperated form the body and is in the source. The Squiddys somehow found a way to get his  mind seperated, and be loaded into the source. So is Smith, as we know he fell into a similar coma. Thats why Neo will confront smith in the source in revolutions, in my opinion.",1056412800,26,1939,4.459154929577465
1893809,5,B00009W2GQ,I just saw the preview for The Matrix Revolutions after beating Enter the Matrix (great game for Matrix fans) and all I can say is that it is going to be 10 times better than the other Matrix films. The scenes look more action packed and many of the unanswered questions that popped up in my head when watching Reloaded are sure to be answered in this final installment of the Matrix series.  Just be sure not to miss out on the great finale that is the Matrix Revolutions.,1055721600,3,473,4.314606741573034
