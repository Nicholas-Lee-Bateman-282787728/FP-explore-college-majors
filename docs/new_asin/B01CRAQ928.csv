7688936,4,B01CRAQ928,"This movie is a Chinese rom com/fantasy type movie.  I watched this movie with my younger brother.  In general we both thought it was funny.  I liked it more than my brother did, he would have given it a 3-star rating at best.  The sense of humor is strange but outside of 'Kung Fu Hustle' I haven't seen many movies like this so my knowledge of Chinese cinema is very limited.  But as I said, I did like the movie.
One side note, I didn't purchase or rent this dvd from Amazon Prime.  I rented it the old fashioned ""less tech"" way from Red Box as compared to the older fashioned no tech way of Family Video.  The point is I don't really have any idea about the extras that purchased dvd or blu ray are since rented dvds no longer seem to have these features.  It has subtitles & is available in a dubbed in English format also.",1468368000,3,828,4.163522012578617

7688938,2,B01CRAQ928,"Kung Fu Hustle (2005) by Stephen Chow is a wonderfully creative film, enjoyable to watch and touching also. There are clever and creative bits from beginning to end. It is a superior film. I urge you to watch it. Shaolin Soccer (2004) was good too, but not on the level of KFH. I really looked forward to Mermaid, based on these earlier Chow releases plus the ""biggest film in China"" line. Compared to KFH, Mermaid is pretty thin soup, Most bits in it are uninspired, or seem aimed at an unsophisticated audience. The ""funny"" police drawing bit was taken from one of his earlier films...and was better done then. To me the magic never happened, the story never took off. Near the end this film is some horrific violence that does not belong in film of this nature. I was so looking forward to this,and I was let down.",1467936000,5,817,4.489932885906041

7688943,5,B01CRAQ928,"The film is a romantic comedy. Lui Xuan is a real estate developer. He has sonars around his island, ""The Green Gulf"" to keep away protected species so he can develop it. Unbeknownst to him, it has trapped and is killing off the local indigenous mermaid (and men too) population. Shan has been assigned to lure Mr. Lui so she/they can assassinate him. Lui courts her as this turns into an odd Chinese version of Romeo and Juliet involving two different species. Shakespeare sells.

The film has English subtitles. The comedy was good. It made me laugh out loud. The police scene was a riot. The sound track fit neatly into the film using mostly stuff we hear in American and old European films. The opening scenes of a side show scam artist sets the comedy mood. The film also has action. It hits on all cylinders.

7688944,4,B01CRAQ928,"""Mei ren yu (Mermaid)"" (2016 release from China; 94 min.) brings the story of Liu Xuan, a real estate developer. As the movie opens, he wins a bidding war at an auction for the Green Gulf conservation area. He plans on converting it into a development of some sort. Meanwhile, we learn that an old ship wreck on Green Gulf is the place where a bunch of mermaids live. They decide Mr. Liu needs to be eliminated, and send their cutest looking girl mermaid, Shan, as the honey trap. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is directed by well-known Chinese actor Stephen Chow. Here he brings an all-too obvious story line that provides some laughs at times, but for me the movie is simply too ""politically correct"" (being super-rich: bad! hurting the environment: bad! etc.). Thankfully the chemistry between the two leads (Chao Deng as Liu Xuan and Yun Lin as Shan) is palpable and that helps a lot. The scenes where Shan as mermaid is in 'fish out of water' scenes work best from a comedy perspective, and hence the first hour of the movie, being heavy heavy on the rom-com, is fine, while the last half hour, being bigger on the action scenes, feels over-blown. Bottom line: I rate the movie 3.5 stars because to me it's an okay but not a 'great' movie, as seen from my (American) perspective, although I will admit that the movie went by in no time..

In case you hadn't heard yet, ""Mermaid"" is the all-time highest grossing movie in China. The movie opened this weekend on a single screen here in Cincinnati, and I was curious to check it out, to see what the hoopla was all about. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay (in fact better than I had expected). Interestingly I was the only non-Chinese/Chinese-American in the theater. There were some jokes and scenes that were well received by everyone besides myself, making me think that these were 'inside' Chinese jokes that simple went over my head as a non-Chinese. Regardless, ""Mermaid"" is worth checking out for the cultural phenomenon that it has become in China.",1457827200,16,2159,4.634464751958225

7688947,4,B01CRAQ928,"I've been waiting for years to find a serious attempt at a live-action mermaid movie, that actually explored the mermaids' society and had more than one mermaid character (usually on the rare occasion you see a mermaid anywhere in live-action media it's a ""Splash"" knockoff, with just one mermaid and very little information about her world). This is the closest I've come so far. And not only is this a great movie for a mermaid fan, it's just a damn fun movie.

The plot contains quite a few cliches, so if that type of thing annoys you well, there's your heads up. But the movie works off those cliches very cleverly. And it has far more fun with the mer-folk than most films bother to even try. The special effects are extremely ambitious, and the fact that the CGI is fairly obvious is little distraction from the fantastic stunts and beautifully-rendered tails and octopus legs. We don't see much in the way of an underwater palace or city, as pollution has forced the merfolk into a sunken steamboat on the edge of the beach; but what they've done with the place is one of the most fun parts of the movie. Their home resembles a sort of cross between a Wisconsin Dells ride and a ""Most Extreme Elimination"" obstacle course.

If you're a fan of mermaids this is a MUST SEE, and if you enjoy Asian humor then I recommend this movie as well.",1498521600,,1345,4.508196721311475

7688953,4,B01CRAQ928,"Highly recommended to fans of bonkers Asian fantasy-adventure films.  And no, I don't mean high octane action or crazy stunts, I mean conceptually bonkers.

Kung Fu Hustle (2004) was pretty silly at times, but knew when to reign in the silly for dire urgency. This film is more deliberately stupid, even slapstick, and feels suitable for childrenat first, anyway.  We even get a nonsensical lesson in the fairy tale evolution of the mer peoplegrounded in some Waterworld theory that diverged the descendants of apes into man on land and merman by sea.  Seems legit.

This was rated R and, for most of the films duration, I fail to see why. In the beginning, its really more childishly cutesy than anythingwith a more PG murderous slant to it. Shan (Yun Lin; Journey to the West: The Demons Strike Back) is a mermaid sent to assassinate Liu Xuan (Chao Deng; Detective Dee), a developer who threatens the ecosystem of her dying mer-race.  Somewhere during her humorously botched attempts to kill him using sea urchins and poison, she instead shows him that money isn't everything and they end up falling for each other.

The film makes a strong pro-environmental statement. Our greedy mogul Liu buys an environmentally protected island, procures a reclamation permit to develop the land, and commissions some sort of super-charged sonar devices to repel (errrexplode) marine life.  It turns out the island he bought was home to Shans mermaid clan (including Chi Ling Chiu and Mei'e Zhang), who live in a shipwrecked tanker where they take refuge from Lius sonar death rays.

The CGI is poor and the wirework is weak and executed too slowly, making long jumps appear more like floating in Willy Wonkas bubble room. The only effects I appreciated were the Octopus mans (Show Lo; Journey to the West) cephalopod legs.  We get a lot of that and he really steals the show!

Overall I wasn't very impressed with the cute aspects of the filmalthough, admittedly, many would favor that sort of warm fuzzy Anime-romance propelling us from first date I love yous to a second date proposal. However, there was one scene that had me howling-laughing out loud for its entire duration. The octopus teppanyaki scene is absolutely worth the price of admission and perhaps the first scene worthy of a PG-13 rating sincewellwe basically see Octopus get unassumingly tortured, with his tentacles chopped up and cooked in a sort of classic comedy scenario right in front of him.  His face is priceless!  Another hilarious part was the police station scene complete with silly sketch art.  And don't even get me into the pants-crapping sonar test bit.

As we move into our final and most violent third act, things shift more into the hard PG-13 stage that apparently earned this an R rating.  Theres no nudity, sex or profanity and there is no direct on-screen death (although much is implied and we witness several harpoonings and gunshot injuries).

Director Stephen Chow (Kung Fu Hustle, Shaolin Soccer, Journey to the West) mixes seafaring folklore with Asian action cinema. If you think you're about to watch The Little Mermaid (1989) meets Kung Fu Hustle (2004), just know its going to be much closer to the giggly former than the latter despite a lot of third act mermaid slaughter.  And the action is not top notchjust passable.  But Chow does deliver all the zaniness youd expect with his Kung Fu Hustle roots.  In addition to the scenes mentioned above, we have fishtail water sorcery smacking of an aquatic Dumbledore and the complete mermaid lair raid insanity including a mad marine biologist shooting machine guns and a leather-clad wealthy realty executrix (Yuqi Zhang; CJ7) giving kill orders and harpooning her business partner as if the two were employed by Doctor Evil!

Bonkers. This was bonkers.  Im reminded of The Good, the Bad and the Weird (2008) and The Warriors Way (2010). This film is one part cutesy Anime romance, one part mythic-meets-modern Little Mermaid fantasy, and one part mermaid genocide lunacy.  No matter what you expected coming into this, I expect youll be entertained!",1494547200,3,4090,4.947368421052632

For U.S. viewers that will feel like a rather odd mix.  However, it mostly worked for me.  I like comedy. I like romance. And I was able to tolerate the horrific moments in the third act.  Another reviewer mentions the awful dubbing: yes, even though this was the biggest movie ever in China, apparently there was no effort made to do a decent job of matching English words to the actors' mouths. In a way though that adds to the comedy feel.  Two reviewers mention the cops-and-drawing scene which had me laughing uproariously.  The ""first date"" segments likewise made me hysterical with laughter.
As a person who is into mermaid fiction/films, I'll comment on the mermaid aspects separately.  Plenty of full views of mers in this film, sitting, swimming etc.  The mer tail design is done in muted colors, very oceanic.  Tail shape is pleasing.  Flukes are a bit understated for my taste but this is balanced by the absolutely stunning fluke of the GrandMer.  (She's kickass.)  The classic ""The Little Mermaid"" requires the sacrifice of voice to go onto land, which this mermaid doesn't have to do, but she does make a different physical sacrifice which is rather dramatic, if you feel for mers!  Secondary male character has octopus style tentacles for lower half of body, for those of you merlovers who look for something a little different. Be prepared though for his character to get into some harsh situations.",1471478400,15,1570,4.79182156133829

The main guy is your classic rich douche that learns that money's not everything, but it doesn't change his personality.

the girl is as dumb as rocks and gets painful at time watching her operate.  that said the actress does slap stick very well and pulls off some very funny failed assassination attempts.

There is also a very dark humor hilarious torture scene or i guess more like a self-mutilation scene in the middle that might turn some people away personally thought it was one of the few unique parts., One of the merpeople was trying to hide their identity while they have to literally make them selves into sushi.

7688988,3,B01CRAQ928,"As a 'hardcore' Stephen Chow fan, like many others, I've been waiting so anxiously for a 'Kung Fu Hustle' sequel which, for whatever reason, has yet to manifest.
Until then, we'll have to be content with this, somewhat convoluted, romantic comedy laced with doomsday environmental messages.
Why this was such a huge box office success in China I can't understand unless the actors happen to be fan favorites or something. This is obviously not a 'crossover' effort to engage American fans - it played only in few, selected, US theaters for about five minutes and was gone. The 3D attributes of that version were relatively modest.
I will say that, true to his style, Stephen Chow still managed to mix humor, spirituality and special effects in a more entertaining and creatively unique way than any other filmmaker I know of.
I still believe that Stephen Chow has the capacity (and hopefully the will) to produce a sequel to Kung Fu Hustle that will satisfy the legion of moviegoers that became his fans and are so eager to see a sequel. I want to believe that the director is holding the bar 'high' for Kung Fu Hustle 2 (if there ever is to be one) and is taking his time so as not to risk tainting the legacy of Kung Fu Hustle which is such a stellar accomplishment.",1469318400,,1268,4.590308370044053
7688989,5,B01CRAQ928,"You all know by now that this movie is the biggest hit at the boxoffie in China in the entire history.
Yes I think it deserves every penny of it.
It's funny, it's truely different romantic, the CG is great, the enviornment is totally new, the acting is over the top but good if you have seen the director's other film KING FUN HUSTLE you will know what I mean.

The budget of this movie was $60,720,000 and it earned  $553,810,228  worldwide which is a new record as a none Hollywood film.

The story is kind of cliche all the way.
There is this company building the ocean world but creats a lot of backlasch that is pollutions.
The thing is mermaids are dying and they want to kill the CEO who is a young handsome guy.
So they decides to bring this girl to him and kill him.
They make her look like human and approach her to him.
But she falls in love with him instead.
He at the beginning hated her because she looke like a humble country girl.
But one clothed pealed after, she was a beautiful innocent childish girl that any man will fall in love.
The man becomes a child like her and falls madly in love with her too.
Now that he has a  business partner who has billions of dollars who is also a beautiful woman who's got an eye on him.
When she founds out that the man is having an eye on the mermaid, she decides to destroy the whole mermaids.
The CEO has to protect them all and also acheive the love of his life.
And again how can they fall in love?
With a mermaid?
How about the child and marrage?

7688993,5,B01CRAQ928,"If you only like your movies made the good old Hollywood way, then China's most successful box office film is not probably the film for you.  But if you can appreciate tales told from different cultures, with a different look and way they tell a story, then you'll enjoy The Mermaid.  I could imagine Disney or someone remaking this for an American audience and making it too kid joke heavy or teen romance aimed and ruining it one day in the future.  But even if that happens, watch this great film instead.

The Chinese are very heavy on the sight gag or I would even call it, klutz characters on films.  There's plenty of characters doing something that backfires on them and makes them look stupid, both villains and ""good guys (or merpeople).  You can choose to watch this in it's original language with English subtitles or choose to watch the film dubbed in English (or Polish). Region 4 version DVD anyway.  I found the dubbing adds to the klutz style characters, since they haven't taken the time to make the English speaking actors voices match up with the actors speaking in their original tongue on the screen, so you've got cases where the actor has finished talking yet the voice continues, or the actor then throws something but is still talking and things like this.  It simply adds to the fun and as I said you can watch it in the original language with subtitles if this bothers you.

The basic plot of The Mermaid has Xuan, a rich young tycoon buying an island that he thinks he can develop and make him billions.  However some pesky rare dolphins need to disappear for him to be allowed to develop, so he implements some sonar sound machine thing that blows them up.  Unbeknownst to him this does the same thing to the local mermaid population that lives there which no one knows exist. You see when man evolved from ape, some of those ape jumped into the sea. They understandably aren't too happy about not being able to swim in the ocean without exploding, so led by an octopus man thing they, pick their cutest mermaid, cut the tip of her tail to resemble feet when in shoes, and tell her to give her phone number to Xuan, so they can kill him when he comes to pick her up (yes they are little naive and think this is how the human world works from what they have learnt from magazines and things they have obtained in an old freighter ship wreck they now live in). Failing that she must kill him herself. She is of course a total klutz as an assassin, and is also addicted to roast chicken that she had discovered in the human world. She also quickly learns that he is not the bad guy they all thought he was and that she also has feelings for him.  But can she convince the octopusman and the other merpeople and save her kind from destruction at the same time.

The movie is a lot of fun and does have a bit of violence in it that a Hollywood film that is this sort of light comedy probably wouldn't.  But that's what makes watching movies from cultures other than your own so much fun!  There's plenty of jumping, acrobatics and scenes obviously filmed using wires and green screens.  A lot of fun, check it out!",1468627200,6,3139,4.41421143847487

What can be done. Ive tried to play it on 3 laptop devices, 2 Stan alone devices at home, and a stand alone device attached to district issued laptops at school. Unsatisfiying when students were looking forward to seeing mermaids.",1506556800,,392,4.444444444444445

I went into watching this thinking I was just going to be disappointed, but to my surprise I loved it.  It's got cool visuals, good comedy, and a little bit of romance that isn't to the point of being sappy and obnoxious.  Highly recommend this.",1504051200,,373,4.426470588235294
