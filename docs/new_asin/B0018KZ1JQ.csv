8270062,2,B0018KZ1JQ,"I expected it to be more interesting. But this documentary is just supporting a myth about Noa's Arc on Ararat mountain. But as I already learned from other sources,  no research was able to prove that it is actually there and no real evidence was found. I do recommend to find more independent opinion on this matter.",1515542400,,318,4.578947368421052
8270063,5,B0018KZ1JQ,"Fantastic, easy-to-understand documentary, with a primary focus on the worldwide flood during the time of Noah. This documentary explains how the flood could be worldwide and how many of the earth's features were formed. Prepared to be surprised! Students should watch this!",1507680000,,274,5.5476190476190474
8270064,2,B0018KZ1JQ,Only ok at best... based on the bible... but way too speculation and plain out guessing.,1501804800,,88,4.5625

8270069,5,B0018KZ1JQ,"Excellent message of the accounts that the God of Abram, Isaiah, & Jacob has given us through His Word/the Bible. This document was well put together.",1471824000,,150,4.8076923076923075
8270070,5,B0018KZ1JQ,"Well-presented. Thought-provoking. I know that archaeology as of late points to the truth of the Biblical stories. Fascinating to see that the Great Flood, as well, may well have happened. As a Christian, I do believe. I found the arguments that fossil records were created quickly, rather than over long spans of eons to resonate deep in my soul. I will definitely be following up with much reading.",1470009600,2,400,4.897058823529412
