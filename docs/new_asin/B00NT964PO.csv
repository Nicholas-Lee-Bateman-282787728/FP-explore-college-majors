Lovely soundtrack--very wistful and whimsical and calming. It's so cute hearing our little guy tell us ""Gruffalo! Mouse! Fox! Come house!"" Or ""Big hands! Tongue black!""

The stories themselves are cute too, the music is pleasing, and the animation is charming.",1484611200,,468,4.318181818181818

6679611,5,B00NT964PO,"The Gruffalo and The Gruffalo's Child are both very charming, clever animated short children's films that adults should also enjoy. I watched by myself and found them both delightful. The Gruffalo's Child is a sequel and has a related story involving some interaction with some of the characters from the first film, however it is told in quite a different way and has a different feel to it as it's told nearly entirely from the perspective of the Gruffalo's Child, who sneaks outside on a snowy winter's night for a bit of exploration. The first film initially has a squirrel family listening to the story about how a mouse outwit getting eaten by a series of predators by telling each one it was going to meet a big, fierce creature called a Gruffalo, which no one has heard of before. Ultimately, the mouse actually meets the Gruffalo, who he evidently thought was imaginary, and she wants to eat him, too, so he has to cleverly figure out how to outwit the creature. I won't give away how, but it is quite clever. The mouse only makes a cameo appearance in the sequel which is exclusively about the adorable Gruffalo's child's snowy nighttime adventure running into many of the animals from the first story. Very nice 2D animation. Children will love the animals and adults will get the cleverness of each story.",1484092800,,1317,4.705627705627705

The stories are sweet and even though they are about a monster type creature, she was not scared at all. I loved that there is no violence and that they are very quiet, as are all of the movies on Prime by this artist or producer. I would recommend Stick Man and Room on the Broom as well. I must add that I am not really the type of person that enjoys watching children's movies, but I must admit that these are worth seeing.",1467417600,,529,4.196078431372549

6679626,5,B00NT964PO,"Two well-complimented tales that will become favorites for all ages. This author has a wonderful sense of storytelling and imagination to create such fanciful creatures you end up loving and caring about no matter how scary they look.
The first movie, The Gruffalo is a great adventure for a clever little mouse in the deep, dark woods. The author makes every spoken word count. It's a simple tale told in a creative way with characters, although intimidating are quick to become favorites.
The second movie, The Gruffalo's Child is a great compliment to the first one, having the adventure from a child's point-of-view. Very charming and heartfelt tale of a small child venturing out on her own in the neighboring wood. From her stick figure that keeps her company on her adventure to all the characters, the movie tells a story we relate to because of our childhood adventures.
The characters are voiced by the best actors in the business and chosen to fit the characters so well. The overall storytelling in both movies narrated by Helena Bonham Carter is brilliant. James Corden as the mouse, Tom Wilkinson as the fox. Robbie Coltrane as the Gruffalo all did great jobs.  I love Shirley Henderson as the Gruffalo's child - she did an awesome job.
The movies were created by a wonderful studio that created the best animated adventure. They created characters that not only mimicked the book but enhanced what the environment and characters would look like in 3-D. The clay models and CG were perfect companions to the execution of these movies.
These two movies are sure to be cherished additions to your viewing libraries to watch over and over again, even when your children have outgrown them.",1465171200,3,1700,4.882352941176471
