7890965,4,6305511950,"Here we have the first two episodes of a three-episode O.A.V. mini-series. (The third episode is on a seperate tape.) This is one of the older ADVision tiles that to date still hasn't been released on D.V.D. (Along with MIGHTY SPACE MINERS and MASTER OF MOSQUITON, THE VAMPIRE.) The show bears similarites to movies like TRON, THE TERMINATOR and GODZILLA.

The anime is one of those shows based on a manga, which becomes evident when you start watching it since it's actually incomplete, starting out somewhere in the middle. The story so far: There exists an alternate dimention, a cyberspace world. The leaders of that world have somehow come to see earth as a threat, thinking that we'll contaminate their world. The council sends three ""domni-matrixes""-three super-powered babes, or ""programs""-to our world to conquer it. They are Compiler, Assembler and Interpreter. However, not long after arriving on earth Compiler and Assembler meet and fall in love with two human brothers, Nachi and Toshi Igarashi. All three domni-matrixes then abandon their mission and opt instead to live with the three brothers peacefully on earth. This, needless to say, outrages the council in the computer world, and they send assassin programs to kill (or ""delete"") the three domni-matrixes and then fullfill their mission of taking over the earth. However, the two assassins sent to terminate Compiler and her friends have already failed no less than 36 times. (This all has already happened when the show starts and is explained in some opening exposition.) Actually Compiler is the one who does all the real fighting; Interpreter only stops by from time to time to give bits of information, and Assembler isn't really anything more than excess baggage. As for Nachi and Toshi, they're just regular guys, so there's not much they can do.

Anyway, at the beginning of episode 1 the two bungling assassin programs, Bios and Directory are forced by the council to be put into a device referred to as the polarity reversal machine. This changes Bios and Directory from their origonal forms-a couple of muscular men-into two slender, comely women! (For some reason I've always had an attraction to stories where characters are changed into something they really don't want to be, so for me this aspect of the show was the highlight for me.) Anyway, now if Bios and Directory (or, rather, Upload and Download, as their new names are,) want to change back, they must complete the mission of terminating Compiler and the others and then taking over the earth. (Presumably the council felt these two needed some extra motivation to get the job done right.)

The first episode is the really great one, as it has lots of action and comedy when Compiler and company meet Upload and Download and the sparks fly. The battles are largely played for laughs. The dub includes the voices of Kelly Manison (Compiler), Jessica Calvello (Assembler), Hillary Haag (Download) and Brett Weaver (Nachi).

The second episode, alas, is increadibly dull. I haven't watched it in years (didn't really feel compelled to see it more than once,) but I recall it being about Assembler and her relationship with Toshi. There is no action and little or no humor. If you like stories that focus on romantic drama or you decide after seeing episode 1 that you REALLY love Assembler, you'll probably enjoy episode 2.

As mentioned before, there is a third episode on a second tape. To briefly summerize, it is a hell of a lot more interesting than episode 2, but nowhere near as good a episode 1. There is action apleanty, but the humor doesn't quite reach the level as when Compiler is fighting Upload and Download. (Oh, yeah, about that, in episode 3 we see Upload and Download have changed back into Bios and Directory. What the heck?! I thought these two had to kill Compiler and her compatriots and then take over the world to get their manhood back, so their being changed back already doesn't make sense, besides the fact that I like their other forms better.)

Anyway, this is a great show to watch and I highly recomend it.",1124928000,,4082,4.883116883116883
7890966,3,6305511950,"This is a real weird video. First off the music is kinda lacking. The action is more like a chessy version of Dragonball Z. The art style *ugh* didn't impress me a bit. The story focuses on two 2-D women from the net, Assembler and Compiler. They're main purpose to destroy the earth. And for a show with bad animation, it manuvers the story into hentai-like show. This makes the show even more hard to bare. This show might be worth a look, but there are so many defects with this show, I can't guaretee your going to like it. I didn't.",980121600,,537,4.2745098039215685
