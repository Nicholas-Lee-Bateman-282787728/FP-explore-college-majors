1256763,5,B000034DDM,"Television is the grandchild of vaudeville, but for decades vaudeville ignored television.  This documentary -- the first ever television program about vaudeville -- is an enhanced version of a 1997 PBS broadcast, part of  the American Masters series. For rights reasons, some of the songs -- like  ""Frankfurter Sandwiches"" -- are missing from the original  broadcast, but they've been replaced by either other songs or more spoken  word routines.  Segments from almost ninety acts are included -- in 1997  People Magazine said this was one of the twelve best television programs of  the year, and the best entertainment special of the year -- that for a show  where most of the performers haven't been seen for thirty years. Also  included are interviews with more than thirty vaudevillians, including June  Havoc, Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, George Abbott, and the Nicholas  Brothers. I think it's a splendid show, but then I should; I wrote and  directed it.",955929600,,962,5.129032258064516
1256764,5,B000034DDM,"If you are interested in entertainment, dancing, comedy or even American history, I recommend this DVD. It has excellent structure, and describes many aspects of the life inside vaudeville music halls. It also addresses  many sensative issues, like the use of blackface in minstral shows, and the  death of vaudeville in the early 30s.
It contains a tremendous amount of  interesting footage of many vaudeville acts. For it's film footage alone,  and being able to witness some of these great acts, this DVD is well worth  it.
This documentary gives excellent examples of the types of  entertainment one would find in the early part of the century and relates  it back to present day. As far as documentaries go, this is an extremely  impressive effort.",948499200,14,753,4.968

Lots of great interviews from old Vaudeville legends",1452643200,,146,5.125

7916473,5,B000034DDM,"In 1997, I bought directly from PBS a VHS of this show.
It's the only single program video that I ever paid thirty dollars for.
That's how much it meant to me.

The two hour 1997 AMERICAN MASTERS episode entitled VAUDEVILLE is narrated by Ben Vereen.
It covers this remarkable form of entertainment from its 19th Century roots
to the modern echoes of vaud, and even makes the point that channel surfing
is a form of private vaudeville where the viewer controls content.

Best thing about this documentary are the dozens of vintage film clips of vaudeville
stars and small circuit nobodies performing the acts it took them years to perfect.

The program is enriched by commentary from a dozen or more survivors, such as
Morey Amsterdam, June Havoc, Joey Faye, Carl Ballantine, the Nicholas brothers,
Rose Marie, Billy Barty, Iron Eyes Cody, June Taylor, Arthur Tracy and Bobby Short.

7916474,5,B000034DDM,"A thoroughly enjoyable primer on entertainment as immigrant America was coming of age; I am revising my review due to the fact that after watching it for the third time I enjoy this DVD more each time.  I am a show biz history buff who liked burlesque, carnival, circus. When you look at the humor and ""girl show"" acts in Burlesque it is pretty tame by todays standards.  While burlesque was more in the tradition of British Music Hall I think Vaudeville evolved as a unique American art form that insisted upon ""sunday show"" standards Tony Pastor (imho the founder of true Vaudeville) instituted.

I would invite anyone who acquires this fine documentary to simply watch the clips of the Nicholas Bros. who imho make this easily worth the price of the video.  The film in addition to discussing Vaudeville that was the norm in the ""tank towns"" the subject of segregation and Yiddish theater are given attention as well.  Purchasers will find it interesting to see former Vaudeville stars like Rose Marie and others who made the transition to the movies and TV.

One final thought is that while some of the clips are brief, one can see acts like the Nicholas Bros. on youtube; these two chaps never made it to the silver screen in a big way because they made fine performers like Astaire and Gene Kelly look weak!!  These two overlooked performers rate a documentary of there own!  Never have I in over 40 years of my study of show biz have I seen an act like the Nicolas Bros.  Burns and Allen are well represented also.",1360540800,,1521,4.583025830258302
7916475,5,B000034DDM,"I can think of little else to write about this documentary motion picture, short that everyone should see it at least once.",1360454400,,123,4.636363636363637
7916476,5,B000034DDM,"This was an excellent b/w film about the wonderful world of Vaudeville.  I played it with my projector on the wall with the sound off at my daughter's birthday party.  She was having a ""talent show"" party and I thought the Vaudeville theme was appropriate.  Came quickly when ordered.",1277424000,,284,4.755102040816326
7916477,5,B000034DDM,"While I concur with other reviewers who wish this had a bit less talking and a lot more of the acts, the documentary is nonetheless excellent.  A lot of those interviewed are old timers no longer with us, and many of their memories and observations are priceless. I think the most praise I can give this doesn't come from me, but my students: I had planned to show about ten minutes of this to my class on the history of musical theater; but the students got so into the documentary that we watched over 40 minutes of it. (They were especially taken by the regurgitators.)

Highly recommended.",1217376000,4,593,4.5327102803738315
7916478,5,B000034DDM,This documentary is one of my favorites. It explains the history and origin of the old art. There is wonderful footage of old acts from the days gone by mostly the 20's and some pricless intervies of old vaudevillians before they died. There is also an interesting segment on race too. It is just too bad that there are not more films of the old acts available.,1168300800,2,361,4.402985074626866
7916479,5,B000034DDM,"Before TV, before radio, even before silent films came vaudeville --- an art form of traveling variety shows in which performers sang, danced, acted, juggled and joked and did just about anything else to make crowds laugh. The golden age of vaudeville was, indeed, the launching pad for many a star, including George Burns and Gracie Allen, Bert Williams, James Cagney, W. C. Fields, Bob Hope and Eddie Cantor, all of whom appear, in rare performances, in this ""American Masters"" documentary hoisted by Ben Vereen. Say hello, Gracie. Now say good-night.",1054252800,5,553,5.087912087912088
