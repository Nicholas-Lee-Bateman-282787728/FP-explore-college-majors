8292004,5,B001D6Y5I8,"A well done documentary on the life of one of the greatest surfers of all time. This video shows his rise and fall and rise again. Archy has stood the test of time and 30+ years later he is still impacting surfing. I grew up surfing at San Clemente pier in the late 80s and 90s and watched Archy blaze the trail and literally change the sport. There was so much talent in San Clemente at that time, it truly was an amazing era -  Fletchers, Dino, Beschens, Ward. Great video.",1433808000,,475,4.21978021978022
8292005,5,B001D6Y5I8,Excellent documentary about a surfer truly ahead of his time. Archy was the leader of the Ariel revolution (Christian Fletcher as well). Kelly Slater and his group benefited from the trail Archy blazed. Truly ahead of his time. And he still continues to be a force in high performance surfing. His influence speaks for itself. Get this video and enjoy the ride.,1427846400,,361,4.838709677419355
