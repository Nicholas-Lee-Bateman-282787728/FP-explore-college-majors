8098997,3,B000CGYM24,"Ms Dixit performs another magnificent dance.  It's eight minutes of dance history.  Sridevi is still a favorite, but, I believe that no one can outdo Madhuri Dixit.

It's been a long time since I watched this movie, so I won't comment on it.  Just don't miss 'Choli Ke Peeche'.",1402531200,,277,4.591836734693878
8098998,4,B000CGYM24,"I would have preferred to have the movie on dvd, but this review is about the movie, not the format.  I gave it 4 stars because of Madhuri Dixit.  She is the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers (rolled into one) of modern dance and traditional Indian dancing.  She can sing and act, too.  I had seen the ""Choli ke peeche"" scene on YouTube, but I wanted to see if the camera frame in the movie might show more of Madhuri as she danced (that is, the lower part of her body which was mysteriously cut out of camera view in parts of the dance in which I strongly suspect she was not stationary).  Otherwise, it's older Bollywood, and, well, that's all I'll say about that.  Watching Madhuri has inspired me to learn some Hindi, so I now know that a ""Choli"" is the halter type blouse that is worn under a ""sari"".  I have also read that the lyrics to the song ""choli ke peeche"" were controversial when the movie was released in 1993 (because it is seductive in a somewhat ribald fashion).  After watching some of the ""chamma chamma"" (an onomatopoeic effort to describe the sounds of the the rings, bells, and anklets worn by the female dancers) and traditional Indian dances, I can understand why there are a billion Indians.",1364428800,,1214,4.436936936936937
