7738749,5,B01EME1XUU,"I'm very happy with this set, but my copy of the bluray edition does not include God's Stepchildren. I think this is a mistake on Amazon's part as Kino Lorber doesn't mention it on their page. Still, an essential purchase for me.",1469750400,15,229,4.476190476190476
7738750,4,B01EME1XUU,"A first glance tells me that this is an invaluable collection, but please note that the DVD version DOES NOT include the following selections, which are indicated in the booklet (though not on the online product description) as being in the Blu-Ray edition only: ""Mercy, the Mummy Mumbled,"" ""Heaven-Bound Travelers,"" and ""We Work Again."" On the other hand, the booklet notes that the Zorah Neale Hurston fieldwork footage is only available on the Blu-Ray, but it's here on the DVDs (""extras"" in disk 5).",1469577600,27,503,5.0

7738753,5,B01EME1XUU,"What a fabulous piece of recovered history! I am so grateful to the folks who engineered this project. From rotting filmstrips in a warehouse in east Texas to remastered discs--what a journey these movies have made. I've only seen the silent films so far---who knew that the famous Micheaux brother tackled the horror of lynching so early on?---and I'm REALLY looking forward to the Spencer Williams religious movies, particularly The Blood of Jesus---but I'm already stunned by this collection. It's almost like stepping into a Tardis. Kudos also on the new jazzy soundtrack for the silents, and on the accompanying booklet. Amazing job!",1483228800,3,638,5.203883495145631

7738755,5,B01EME1XUU,"Beautiful visually, even the unrestored parts. Wonderful to see how filmmakers told stories with just images, no sound, and not much of a budget.

7738759,5,B01EME1XUU,"Ive had this amazing boxed set for almost a month now and Im still working my way through it. There is over 21 hours (!!) worth of material here and finding the time has been difficult but its worth it, and Im sure Ill be revisiting the set again and again. It reminds me a lot of a wonderful DVD set released by Kino (one of the top quality reissue companies for classic films) back in 2005 (before Bluray) titled Edison: The Invention of the Movies, which was a four-disc set with ultra-rare silent films with new music scores and bonus featurettes with commentary by film expert Charles Musser.

This set is five Blu-rays (more packed in on each disc and higher resolution with full (or as full as is known to exist) of both silent and sound feature films made by African- American filmmakers  primarily Oscar Micheaux and Spencer Williams. They combed large collections around the world and the Museum of Modern Art to provide the best copies. And the musical sound tracks for the silent films is provided by solo piano, and orchestra as well as one by jazz drummer Max Roach and  a few remixes from DJ Spooky. The bonuses include featurettes on restoration and commentary by the aforementioned Prof. Musser and Jacqueline Najuma Stewart. There are no feature musicals per se but these filmmakers almost always found a way to include a nightclub scene with jazz and blues performances to offset the (often) religious messages.

I want to also point out that this is not just a DVD or BD set. The box comes with a gorgeously illustrated 78-page booklet of essays and notes on each film. This is really a film course in a box on an overlooked part of the American movie culture.

Yes, its not an inexpensive set but there is so much here you will go back to it often and the production quality is superb.

I noted one reviewer (before me) lamented the inclusion of a film that was advertised by Kino to be included. I don't know the reason its not here (maybe space, maybe quality of available print) but thats certainly no reason to skip acquiring it. After all you have a FULL-days worth of material here (not to mention the book of notes.

Its been 11 years since the Edison set and I can hardly wait to see what in-depth collection Kino will come up with next.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8759163,5,B01EME1XUU,"I found the film Dirty Girty From Harlem in a supermarket in New Orleans during a relief effort I was helping with. The introduction about the Tyler Texas hidden films was given by Ossie Davis, and I was thrilled. I played it for everyone who came to visit me. Last year I found a western from these hidden treasures, here on Amazon, and was thrilled again. This beautiful slice of history is very important, because it shows our ancestors writing, directing, and producing films that hollywood would not, because they felt more safe if we only played extensions of their story, and not our own. Hollywood films from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s always made me want to vomit. I used to hate black and white films, until I ran into these time capsules of our excellence, waiting in the shadows to be born again. The stories in these gems are as varied as your imagination can take you. Our ancestors made a collective decision, not to be ignored.  They  made the choice to tell their own story, and leave a trail of breadcrumbs for us to find.
They knew it was a long shot, they knew that hollywood would try to hide or destroy it, but they were determined, and hopeful that we would find it one day, and be proud of what they accomplished, We Did, and We Are. > Heaven Bless The Ancestors of African Cinema.<",1520812800,,1303,4.447698744769874
