8662766,5,B00KZ197BM,"This DVD is a ""shoot"" interview for wrestler-extravagant, Leva Bates. She talks about her career, her experiences in the industry of Professional Wrestling, and some of her interests as well as her inspirations growing up as a fan. I highly recommend this ""Diaries"" for anyone who is comfortable with being what society has called ""nerdy"". As a proud lifelong Circuit board-Certified ""Nerd-ologist"", I must say that I connect with Ms. Bates on an ever exceeding level (because she's always getting more & more terrific)

Highspots (the seller & producer of these 'Diva Diaries') is straight-to-the point & intriguing in their presentation of these interviews. These DVDs are collectibles.",1412812800,,688,5.37037037037037
