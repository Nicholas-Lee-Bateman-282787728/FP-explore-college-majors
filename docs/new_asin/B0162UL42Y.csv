8735448,5,B0162UL42Y,"This series was playing on the single Danish TV channel when I moved to Denmark in the early 70's, and we all (that is, all of Denmark!) gathered around to watch it on our in-law's bkack and white TVs. Unfortunately, this one is so old it is not texted, but my husband, who is trying to learn Danish, is enjoying it, with a few comments from me.
All the actors have had great careers in the Danish film and TV world, so most are very recognizable if you weren't around then. One character is played by Helle Virkner, whose husband, politician Jens Otto Krag, became Prime Minister while Huset was still playing. Helle Virkner and several others from ""Huset"" later appeared in the popular series Matador, a sort of Danish Downton Abbey, which unfortunately is not available at this time here.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matador-Complete-Series-Matador-Matador-Kollektionen-1929-1947/dp/B001HOBRPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matador: Complete Series = Matador: Matador Kollektionen 1929-1947</a>",1479859200,,1041,5.900662251655629
