8070237,3,B0009Y264K,"Psychic Academy was one of the first manga series I ever read, and I hold it dear to my heart because of that. I found out just a few years too late about the anime adaptation; by that time they were out of print, and I was out of luck. Hunting down a reasonably priced copy of this took me quite some time, but thanks to a series of rather fortunate events, I got one.

Psychic Academy focuses on protagonist Ai Shiomi. In an alternate modern day Japan, people have developed psychic abilities known as aura powers. Ai's brother Zero is a famous psychic, in whose shadow Ai is constantly dwelling. Ai gets accepted to Psychic Academy, but there's only one problem: Ai has not shown any psychic abilities! As much as he is dreading going, he knows his childhood friend Orina also attends, and is looking forward to seeing her again. On his way to his first day of class he encounters a mysterious girl named Mew who changes his life forever, and helps awaken his powers.

Being a big fan of the manga, I couldn't help but pick it apart as I watched. I will list the cons before the pros, save the good parts for last, y'know?

Cons
- The opening and ending. Both are pretty darn sub-par. Not only is the animation of them below average, but just viewing the opening you would think the whole series is about Mew. The ending, while still pretty awful, is not as bad, but the credits have a couple typos in them. A bit sloppy for an official Tokyopop release.

- While the characters are drawn well, pretty close to Katsu Aki's style, the animation itself isn't really that good. A little clunky and lame at times, and occasionally repetitive. There's also a few mistakes; at one point Orina's hair is completely the same shade as her fringe, Purse's earrings first turn the same shade as her hair then go missing altogether during the exam battle, and during Mew and Ai's ""date"" after the arcade the strings of her neck...thing go back and forth between being attached to her shirt, partially being attached, and simply being a necklace. It was made in 2005, but it looks like something out of the late 90s at times.

- A lot of little details are skipped on, some parts don't match up with the manga, this is to be expected though.

- Rather than Zero being constantly present as in instructor as he is in the manga, he's some sort of shadowy, Batman-esque figure, appearing only for a few seconds before disappearing again. I always loved Zero's presence in the manga, he's one of my favorite characters, so you can imagine how much it sucks only seeing him from time to time. Throughout the entire first volume, he has about fifty seconds of overall screen time.

- Ren's voice doesn't sit well with me. This may just be me, but I feel like his voice belongs on some pretty eyed bishie, not a rough and tumble rule breaker.

- Do not let ""twelve episodes"" fool you. When I heard this had twenty four episodes overall, I assumed that meant twenty four full half hour long episodes. The whole series consists of four ""episodes"", which each consist of six mini episodes that are about eight minutes long a piece. The episodes jump around, and nearly half of episodes were done before it even moved on to the second volume of the manga. Another reviewer said that the anime only covers about half the manga, so I'm sure I'll be disappointed when it comes to the end.

Pros
- Most of the voices do fit with the characters, so much that they nearly fit the ones I had imagined in my head while reading!

- Seeing as this is based off a seinen manga, it's always good for a bawdy laugh. There is tons of fanservice in this, ranging from bouncing breasts in school uniforms to fully naked girls in tubs. Poor Ai is always getting himself in trouble with the ladies, mostly in the forms of unintentional breast grabs.

- As I mentioned, the characters are drawn beautifully, especially the females (their eyes even more so.) It looks like Katsu Aki's characters jumped right off the page onto the screen.

- It's simply nice to have such an under the radar manga be an anime, despite its shortcomings.

I'd only recommend this to hardcore fans of the manga, like myself. If you're looking for something new and visually stunning, this isn't really it.",1372636800,2,4244,4.496103896103896

To anyone who plans on buying this google it and read it for free first, see if this is realy worth what your going to pay. Because its not, trust me. If you search hard enough you can probably find it for a tenth of the price he's asking for it.",1367020800,,332,3.970149253731343

8070240,2,B0009Y264K,"I haven't bought the series but have watched a friends copy that he downloaded after I read the entire manga series. I was, not particularly satisfied with the quality of the animation or voice overs. The reason the title of my review is ""not worth the money.."" is because the anime series only covers about half the manga series and the company that made it declared long ago that they weren't going to finish the series in it's entirety. So if you've read the manga, the show only gets to about the island vacation part, then stops. And as some of the reviews have stated its for the teenage boys that want fan-service. It does follow the story pretty well, but doesn't focus on the main character ""Ai"" as it should. If you want to know the real story just buy the manga. My next statement isn't directed toward any particular seller, but from the years of research trying to find this particular series, just for the sake of owning it, there hasn't been any legally made DVDs of this show. And this is after regularly contacting and searching through the inventories of many respected and known anime retailers about the production and availability of is show.",1293580800,,1163,4.6231884057971016
8070241,1,B0009Y264K,"The review title pretty much says it all, but I'll say it one more time; this show is absolutely idiotic.  The idea behind it was all right, but the show itself is less about the main character developing his inner powers and following in his talented older brother's footsteps and more about the overly developed figures of his two female friends.  Character, dialogue, and art are all pretty lousy.  I have no recollection of the music, which means it was at best, unremarkable.

In all fairness, there was one interesting element.  In the show, there's a dream that everyone with special powers at some point dreams that involves being on an ordinary beach at sunset.  The concept gave the show a nice sense of mystery.  However, now I've shared this interesting element with you, so you have even less reason to watch because there really is nothing to it other than that.

I'd recommend this show only to teenage boys who like a lot of fanservice and the one-guy-amongst-lots-of-beautiful-girls theme.  Even if you like those things though, there are way better shows to watch than this.",1145750400,3,1092,4.827956989247312
8070242,3,B0009Y264K,"Why the heck would I want to pay extra money for the product just so I could get the comic which I already have with it? I asked the seller if there was a version without the comic, but they were like ""sorry we only sell it this way.""",1132099200,3,234,3.795918367346939
