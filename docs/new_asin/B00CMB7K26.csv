Lal (director) excelled in all aspects; story, script, direction etc. Movie starts with a flashback how our heroes become friends in a believable way. Then titles appears with Harihar Nagar old version scenes insets. Now you're all set for the fun ride. Appukkuttan (Jadadish) is still the same as you've seen 18 years ago! (how can one ever forget 'kaakka thoori') Somewhere before first half ends, you might predict that Maya (Laxmi Rai) character could be the old villain John Honai's (Riza Bava) daughter came to revenge the four. And at the interval scene Maya discloses her name as 'Christina Honai'. And you'll sit back proud thinking 'yes I've been watching movies for years I knew what will happen'. But wait...that's where our Director rocks. What really surprise you is the suspense towards the end! Go and watch it with family. Laugh like kids.",1367452800,,887,4.959731543624161
