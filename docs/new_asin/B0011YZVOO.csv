The rating is fair simply because I got to see an oldie I've been wanting to see for a minute sad last time I saw it, it was better than.

""SHAOLIN VS TAI CHI""
Buddhists and Taoists hold a friendly but serious contest to see who will take care of a (non-mammalian) golden seal.  The Buddhists win, but have to keep driving away some pesky ninjas that are trying to swipe it.  Though they are successful at keeping it, they must train a young orphaned monk named Fong Err to fight in the next match with the Taoists.  The young monk meets an older monk who practices ""Intoxicated Boxing"" and shows the lad a few things with the aid of some wine.  At the match with the Taoists, a ninja manages to steal the seal, and the two representatives must set out to find it, but they stand to find/lose a lot more than they bargained for.

Presentation varies, but is pretty good, and widescreen.  Problem is that it's subtitled only, and they are often quite difficult to read.  Also, English was not the first language of whoever did the translation.  Beyond that, pretty good, with decent fights that got progressively better.  3/5

""SHAOLIN VS NINJA""
Not much on plot.  Some ninjas try (repeatedly) to kill a Shaolin abbot and then challenge the monks to competition.  Though the story is lame, the fights and especially the acrobatics are AMAZING.  The only actors I recognized were Alexander Lo Rei and the younger acrobat, both of whom were in ""Shaolin vs Lama"".  The lead role might have to go with the abbot, who gives the coolest portrayal of a monk that I've ever seen.  This is the guy that I wanna learn from.  Calm and collected, this cat tells all his monks to relax while a bunch of dudes are trying to assassinate him.  Not one of those hypocritical jerk-monks like in ""Shaolin Intruders"".  Also some interesting costumes.  Other than that, just sit close to the floor so your jaw won't hit it too hard.  The picture is very good and widescreen also.  This one is English-dubbed only. 4/5
