7963718,5,B0000687DH,"Beavers Galore! Dozens (Literally) of naked women. Almost all are attractive. The nudity is full frontal, and as a bonus there are almost no naked guys. The thin plot is secondary to the women. A delightful hour or so of eye candy.",1487376000,,231,4.523809523809524

7963721,4,B0000687DH,"This film is a visual delight. The numerous girls are all natural beauties with real breasts and lush pubic hair, no tattoos or piercings. Forget the plot, just enjoy this unique little gem for what it is--: a parade of  luscious, voluptuous young ladies.",1305504000,6,255,4.795454545454546
7963722,1,B0000687DH,"There were some very sexy and beautiful women back in the 60s and 70s. Unfortunately, absolutely NONE of them can be found on this DVD collection. ""Thousand Pleasures"" is an extremely low budget film that is practically unwatchable as an actual movie. It was intended to be what at the time would have been considered ""X Rated"" adult entertainment. The ""sexy"" parts are equally unappealing and the women look as though they're hanging around naked just because they had nothing better to do.

But wait, it gets worse. ""Wayout Topless"" is a collection of old 60s striptease footage from various clubs around the country, and frankly, these women should've been paid to keep their clothes ON, not take them off! ""Way Too Much Cellulite"" would've been a better name for this. If seeing unattractive, out of shape women gyrate to a retro beat is your thing, then grab this DVD!

The extra features are equally awful. Even a one star rating is far too generous for this junk. MINUS 5 stars would be more appropriate.",1241568000,7,1011,4.771428571428571
7963723,4,B0000687DH,"Is the guy who wrote the previous review dead or somethin'? How could looking at hundreds of different naked women ever be boring? Street of a Thousand Pleasures has some of the most beautiful women you'll ever see in a movie, period. I was expecting Way Out Topless to be more like Russ Meyer's Mondo Topless (a classic of the genre) so I was a little dissapointed but there's plenty of vintage teasin' action to be seen. Pasties and g-strings are the thing here, bub!

Be sure to check out the extras too! Lot's more action on tap here also..",1220400000,21,544,4.44
