1205021,4,B00000F4MA,"After all these years, Cronenberg is still an artist. He's made another low-budget, sure-to-bomb-at-the-box-office movie that he just HAD to make. His career suffers a little, but the audience benefits.
With a great script (by the author of the novel) and Ralph Fiennes already attached to it, Cronenberg couldn't say no. Fiennes is amazing, playing what turns out to be a pantomime role --- he hardly speaks. He conveys everything through gestures, mumbling, and his eyes. The rest of the cast is just as good.
The pace might put you off, but you can't really judge this film until you've seen it twice. It's subtle movie. The final moments bring it all together in a way that makes the second viewing much more satisfying.
The Cronenberg audio track is also very good. The director explains the movie as it goes along. This would be a bad idea if the story was simple, but it isn't. He explains, for example, that he didn't want this to be a clinical examination of schizophrenia, so he didn't bother to get every detail of that particular mental disorder correct. Once you take the movie for what it is --- concise, light on special effects, and impressionistic --- it turns into a very rewarding experience.
Even the length is impressive. Rather than take the bloated approach of a Oscar-ready Hollywood ""mentally ill guy"" movie, he sticks to his horror-film roots and keeps it down to an hour and a half.
The only real weakness is the lack of small touches, the memorable moments that turn a good movie into a great one. The ""quickie in the tunnel,"" for example, is unforgettable. Cronenberg should have added more of these small shocks and simple visual effects to keep the audience on their toes.",1061510400,7,1703,4.756756756756757
1205022,5,B00000F4MA,"This 2002 film stars Ralph Fiennes as man who has just been released from a mental institution after many years.  He obviously still has mental illness, but is probably not considered a threat, and so he's sent to a dreary halfway house run by Lynn Redgrave.  His isolation from the world is clear as he wanders around the streets of London and partial memories come back to haunt him. The audience actually has a chance to get inside his mind and it's never clear as to what is real and what isn't.
On one of his wanderings, he looks inside a house and sees a mother and child.  Soon we understand that this family is his interpretation of his own world as a child.  Ten-year old Bradley Hall plays the young boy and the role calls for him to live in a world that seems slightly askew.  Miranda Richardson is cast as the mother as well as two other different roles, and she does such a good job that I thought there were actually three different actresses.  It wasn't until I saw the special features on the DVD that I realized what was going on.
As the story unfolds we see the boy witnessing his father, played by Gabriel Bryne, romancing both the mother and a local woman he meets in a bar.  There's a murder.  And we're not exactly sure what happened because the details just don't seem real.  It takes a while for us to realize that this is because the director, David Cronenberg, in his adaptation of a novel by Patrick McGrath, actually brings us inside the mind of this poor tortured man.
It's all very abstract and hard to follow and I found myself bored and impatient.  But I'm glad I sat through the film to the end and saw the special features on the DVD.  It helped make sense of a very complex and expressionistic film that delves deep within the human psyche and gives us a glimpse into the dark world of the mentally ill.
This is not a film for everyone.  It is disturbing on many levels.  It's also hard to understand.  However, it is so brilliantly done that I do not hesitate in giving it a high recommendation, especially for certain kinds of film buffs who can appreciate an abstract film and not care if it leaves a sad resonance.",1060992000,5,2153,4.376884422110553
1205023,5,B00000F4MA,"Patrick McGrath is a fine writer of bizarre, beyond the edge stories and finally someone has found the courage to tackle one of his basically 'inner mind' stories.  SPIDER dates back to 1991, before McGrath wrote ASYLUM, DR HAGGARD'S DISEASE, BUTCHER BOY, MARTHA PEAKE etc and that story showed all the promise of the author's ability to find entry into the dark interstices of the ill mind, a line of detail he continues to follow and expand.

David Cronenberg, that master of the macabre, was the absolute right director to transpose this map (read 'web') of the schizophrenic mind to film.  His cast is impeccably correct:  Ralph Fiennes manages to create a three dimensional character out of the title role, while Miranda Richardson, Lynn Redgrave, and Gabriel Byrne and all the bit players feel fully in character at all times.  The grisly story is beautifully photogrpahed and meticulously scored (a very finely orchestrated score by Howard Shore) and if at times the film feels longer than the usual movie, realize that this is the way a disturbed and immobile brain deals with the outside world.

For the story read the other reviews.  For your edification, buy or rent this amazingly disturbing film and keep your mind open.......

Note: watching this little masterpiece of a film ten years later only serves to increase appreciation of the work of Cronenberg, Howard Shore, Ralph Fiennes, Miranda Richardson, Gabriel Byrne, and Lynn Redgrave.  Knowing the story both from the book and from the film seen before enhances the experience of watching the child Dennis Cleg 'Spider' (Bradley Hall) morph into the adult patently disturbed beyond repair adult. And the respect for the performances of John Neville and Gary Reineke as the fellow 'inmates' in Mrs. Wilkinson's home as well as the psychiatrist played by Philip Craig only grows.  This is an exceptional film, and doubtless will become a cult classic.  Grady Harp, March 2012",1060819200,2,1941,5.034375
1205024,4,B00000F4MA,"Spider (David Cronenberg, 2002)
Wow.
David Cronenberg gets away from his obsession with biomechanics and teams up with novelist/screenwriter Patrick McGrath (The Grotesque, the forthcoming Asylum) and a stable of brilliant actors to bring McGrath's chilling novel Spider to the screen. And the job they do is utterly fascinating.
The film is deliberately-paced (read: slow), which is likely to put off some viewers, but Cronenberg allows the characters to find themselves in the time allotted; remember, this is a character study more than it is a plot-driven mystery. Spider spends his time trying to solve the mystery of his past, yes, but that's incidental to him trying to solve the mystery of himself. As the film begins, Spider (the incredible Ralph Fiennes in the role of his career) has just been released from the asylum and sent to a halfway house overseen by a surprisingly likable harridan named Mrs. Wilkinson (Lynn Redgrave). Spider is a schizophrenic, and much of the buzz surrounding the film dealt with how well the filmmakers and Fiennes portrayed the schizophrenic mindset. Don't be looking for Sam Jackson's wonderful performance in The Caveman's Valentine here, though; Spider is almost the diametric opposite of Romulus Ledbetter; obsessively inner-directed, muttering to himself rather than shouting at the neighbors, longing for human companionship (which he finds in a couple of fellow halfway house inmates, Terence [John Neville] and Freddy [Gary Reinieke]) but unsure what to do with it when he gets it. He is far more fascinated with scenes of his early life that he, and we, see regularly throughout the film as he tries to piece together the reason he originally went insane.
The present-day scenes are strong, but the past scenes are even stronger. Gabriel Byrne and Miranda Richardson play Spider's mother and father, and both balance a very delicate line between playing the ogre and the saint Spider sees and playing the confused parents of a child who is obviously already showing signs of mental disturbance that (we assume) they truly are. Both have done some excellent work in their time, but, like Fiennes, they have truly outdone themselves in these roles. As Spider gets closer and closer to figuring out the end of the story, both as he sees it and as (we assume, again) it really happened, both Byrne and Richardson's characters change subtly and get closer to (what we perceive as) reality.
The extra DVD materials are fascinating; Cronenberg's interviews about the filming techniques and the reasoning behind some of the shots brought the ideas behind them out even more, lending an even more impressive weight to the film itself.
Highly recommended on all counts. **** 1/2",1060560000,2,2719,5.126126126126126
1205025,2,B00000F4MA,"As a film in itself ""Spider"" is okay, but David Cronenberg's film fails, regrettably, as an adaptation of Patrick McGrath's excellent novel. All the more surprising, since McGrath is credited with the screenplay.
THE MOVIE, BY ITSELF ... is very deliberately paced. It requires something that growing numbers of MTV-generation movie fans lack: An attention span. And anyone looking for Cronenberg's trademark grotesquerie will be disappointed; this is, as many reviewers have already pointed out, Cronenberg's most ""mainstream"" effort to date. But there are some good performances here. Ralph Fiennes immerses himself in the twitchy, nicotine-stained shabbiness of the title role, and the always-fabulous Miranda Richardson displays her formidable range as one, then two, then later three different characters. And where did they find Bradley Hall, the young actor who plays Dennis Clegg (Spider) as a boy? They must have had photos of Ralph Fiennes at the age of ten and used them during the casting call. Sadly, there's not much of a story, though there might have been had Cronenberg been more faithful to the novel. And if you've either read the novel or think you might do so in the future, please read on ...
AS AN ADAPTATION OF THE NOVEL ... this film is pretty damned disappointing. Patrick McGrath's novel is told in the first person by Dennis Clegg, a schizophrenic who is trying to make some kind of transition from the asylum to something resembling normal life. But he's not taking his medication, and he's losing his fragile grip on reality. At least in the book we have a cohesive narrative, however delusional, by Spider himself ... but that's completely missing from the film, replaced instead by Fiennes' muttering incomprehensibly to himself throughout the picture, so the viewer is forced to speculate about Spider's history and what's going on in his head. I will admit that director Cronenberg does and admirable job of portraying working class London, and the scenes filmed down at the allotments were almost exactly as I had pictured them in my mind while reading the book. But Cronenberg squanders some great opportunities to translate some of the more hallucinatory aspects of Spider's story to the screen. And I was most disappointed by how Cronenberg changed the ending of the story; at least in the book Spider was capable of making some choices, however final, but in this film that choice is taken away from him.
David Cronenberg is capable of making successful film adapations of books. Consider his treatment of ""The Dead Zone"" by Stephen King, which most consider the best film adaptation of any of King's novels. As a Cronenberg fan I had high expectations for this latest effort ... much too high, it now seems.",1060128000,10,2747,5.039560439560439
1205026,4,B00000F4MA,"The creepy psychological thriller, ""Spider,"" is difficult and challenging even for a David Cronenberg film.  It is also immensely rewarding.
The film starts off slowly, but like the spider of the title, it spins a web that draws us into the center of its world and never lets us out.  Ralph Fiennes delivers a bravura performance in the largely nonverbal role of a mentally disturbed man who, upon his discharge from an asylum, takes up residence in a drab halfway house in London.  As Fiennes shuffles, mumbles and twitches his way about the house and around the neighborhood, a fascinating Oedipal drama emerges.  Throughout the course of the story, Spider, the adult, begins to intrude more and more into the past as he watches unobserved the events he believes occurred in his childhood.  As a boy, he obviously adored and worshiped his mother (Miranda Richardson), so much so that, as a grownup, he begins to imagine himself present at events that depict his father's supposed infidelities (and worse), clearly hoping that, by doing this, Spider can eliminate his father either as a rival or, at best, as an agent of further defilement.  In order to continue seeing his mother as sacred, the young Spider finds a unique, but ultimately fatal method of ""objectifying"" her and the feelings he has for her (a method that fits perfectly into the old Madonna syndrome).  It is an act that will have fatal consequences for the family unit.
What makes all this so absorbing is the way in which Cronenberg and scenarist Patrick McGrath delve into the subconscious madness of the main character.  For large stretches of the film we literally have no idea if what we are seeing in the past actually happened or whether it is all the product of a deeply disturbed mind.  Only towards the end do all the pieces fall into place, revealing the ""truth"" beneath the surface of this highly disturbing tale.  ""Spider"" is a thriller in the richest sense of the term because it builds its suspense gradually and subtly, fully aware that the greatest threats come from our own distorted views of reality. Against such madness, how can any of us be safe?
Cronenberg has provided a somber, stark environment in which to unfold his drama.  The drab colors, sterile settings, somber music and pervasive spider imagery all contribute to the foreboding atmosphere of the piece.  As Spider, Fiennes is a revelation, conveying the disturbed nature of the character through indirection and understatement, never going over the top in his portrayal of a truly insane man, making him all the more convincing and chilling.  Miranda Richardson (in a triple role), Gabriel Byrne, Lynn Redgrave, John Neville and young Bradley Hall all contribute mightily to the success of the work.
My biggest fear is that many people will tune out this film early on because of its admittedly slow pacing in the first half.  If they do, I am sorry to say they will have missed one of the most intriguing and gripping movies to be released in a long time.",1060041600,5,3009,4.828793774319066
1205027,4,B00000F4MA,"That is exactly how you will feel after watching Cronenberg's latest, and surprisingly most accessible work.  Compared to other C. material, Spider is very simple in its plot but extremely complex in execution.  Notice the lack of eye contact and complete shame throughout the entire life of Spider after a significant event.  As a boy he can stare you straight in the face and call you a ""murderer"" but as an adult he has succumbed to muttering and hiding things in his pockets.
  Enough cannot be said of Fiennes and Richardson, both absolutely perfect in their roles.
  Anyone who follows Cronenberg knows it will not be an easy watch, and sometimes the reward is great ( Dead Ringers, Existenz,Videodrome, The Fly) and sometimes not as great as you hope ( M.Butterfly, Crash, Naked Lunch) but the viewing is always a pleasure.  The music, art direction, pacing and colors of a C. film are always impressive and worth traveling to see, each piece is a work of art, and Spider is definitely that.
  As with every C. exercise, don't try to make sense of Spider's history, we probably never saw the real history.  His mind is so preoccupied with schizophrenia that what the film lays out as an explaination may not really be, this may be frustrating for some, as it was in ""Existenz"" but here it is not. Because of the subject matter, just revel in the perfect acting and direction .",1059609600,2,1383,4.6735537190082646

It's a perfectly acted, incredibly realistic and disturbing film about a man with a severe mental illness- which means, of course, that most of America won't be able to stomach watching it. If you thought ""A Beautiful Mind"" was a great movie and depicted mental illness perfectly, then you probably won't like this film. From the opening scene at a train station (that takes what seems like forever for Ralph Fiennes to get off the train) right to the ending revelation, I was riveted.",1059004800,6,518,4.831460674157303

It so accurately recreates the dreariness of this man's existence as to create an experience for the viewer comparable to sitting in a dank cellar for 2 hrs contemplating a rotting turnip.
I wanted to love this film, as I adore dramatic, even extremely depressing movies. I am a big fan of Cronenberg, whose work has always been interesting and often compelling (Dead Ringers, The Fly) but this, his first supposedly ""serious"" film makes ""Nil by Mouth"" (dir: Gary Oldman-great film) look like a fluffy comedy. It looks as if he has been trying to please the critics, who have never given him an even break before. It appears he has succeeded-THEY love this film.
It could have been great and has many excellent features but sadly, they just don't add up to a good film, mainly because of the torturously slow pacing. The first 45 minutes are especially hard to bear as nothing seems to happen, and there is no daylight in the film at all for about an hour.

1205105,5,B00000F4MA,"Written by Patrick McGrath, based on the novel of the same name by Patrick McGrath; directed by David Cronenberg; starring Ralph Fiennes (""Spider""  Cleg), Miranda Richardson (Mrs. Cleg/Yvonne/Mrs. Wilkinson), Gabriel Byrne (Bill Cleg), Lynn Redgrave (Mrs. Wilkinson) and John Neville (Terrence) (2002): David Cronenberg, bless his soul, likes to go places other filmmakers don't, won't, or can't. In the case of Spider, he heads back into the territory of Dead Ringers, giving us a horror story in which there is no catharsis, no growth, and no hope. It's an astonishingly bleak film.

Ralph Fiennes, complete with hair that was apparently an homage to Samuel Beckett (the playwright, not the Quantum Leaper), plays the titular schizophrenic without the bells and whistles someone like, say, Robert DeNiro might have demanded. There's no showiness, no look-at-me-acting scene of yelling or imploring the audience for empathy. Spider is almost completely mute, and when he does talk, he mumbles incoherently.

Spider's been released from a mental asylum into a halfway house when the movie begins, in a rundown, vaguely 1980's-looking urban England. His nickname comes from a tendency he's had since childhood to weave elaborate webs out of string and pieces of rope. He's a pattern maker. But he's also schizophrenic. The patterns he makes, the viewer needs to remember, may look sound, but they're inherently flawed.

The movie takes us through Spider's reminscences of his childhood, of what seems to be an ogre-ish and unfaithful father and a saint of a mother. How reliable are Spider's memories? Therein lies the mystery of the movie, inevitable as death. This isn't a movie to enjoy in a normal way -- it's horrifying, and there's no attempt to make Spider warm and cuddly, a Hollywood madman. He's very sick. And schizophrenia doesn't spring from some easily understandable childhood trauma: it's a disease, a cancer of the mind.

I was exhausted by the end of the movie, and that was from watching it in 20-minute increments over several days. But it was a good exhaustedness. But this isn't Rain Man or A Beautiful Mind. There are no easy life lessons here, no Nobel Prize, no well-meaning brother who learns valuable things from someone with cognitive difficulties, though there are, even for Spider, flashes of clarity amidst the crushing horror. And the clarity just makes the horror worse.",1328227200,,2402,5.16452442159383
1205106,4,B00000F4MA,"Rather than his usual niche market of perversity and naked violence, Cronenberg has made an excellent arthouse film about the struggle of a disturbed man who returns home.  Fiennes is Mr. Cleg, a schizophrenic man who has left a mental asylum for the first time since his childhood.  Checking into a halfway house in his old neighborhood, run by a tough old matron, he goes about exploring his childhood haunts, mixing past and present in painful recollections of some kind of a trauma.  This technique is extremely effective in showing not just the disarray of his mind, but also his slippery hold on reality.

The story that emerges has meaning, i.e. his illness is not merely a ""chemical imbalance"" but linked to experience.  As it unfolds, he portrays his family:  a loving mother, a cold and apparently abusive father, whose relationship with a local hooker disrupts their home.  All the while, Cleg is writing down his ideas in code in a tiny notebook that he hides.  As the process progresses, the viewer can see how he is fighting to see the truth, in spite of the lies he has weaved around himself like the webs that obsess him.  It is remarkable how well each piece fits as in a puzzle.  When it emerges, the truth is far worse than what he imagined (which I won't give away).

Fiennes is amazing in the role.  He has to show all the inner turmoil by his gestures and posture, which exude the broken state of his self and mind.  It is so believable it is painful to watch.

I would recommend renting this - you won't want to watch it again.  But it is a masterpiece.",1325635200,,1576,4.519434628975265

1205108,3,B00000F4MA,"Maybe I just don't get him, but David Cronenberg is not a director I've readily embraced.  I haven't seen all of his films, but I've seen a number of them and each time (with the exception of `The Fly') I've walked away wondering what the attraction is.  He has a very recognizable aesthetic and I appreciate some of the ways he shapes a film (despite finding `A History of Violence' to be an uneven disappointment, there is no denying that Cronenberg's directorial efforts were outstandingly precise) but overall I find his films to be so much less than they could have been.

`Spider' is not the exception.

The overall premise of the film is one I found astutely interesting.  I wanted to dive into this with reckless abandonment and really uncover something golden.  Instead, I was left with half a film, a film that had great promise but seemed to crash under the weight of its own attempts.

It tried very hard.

The film follows a schizophrenic man who is forced to face his own demons when he is released from a mental institution and takes up in a halfway house in his old neighborhood.  In the vicinity of tragic memories, Spider starts to pick at his past, revisiting moments he remembers well and jumbling them up to create a faux reality he initiated at childhood, a reality that cost him his sanity (not to mention his family).

Visually, the film is a gritty masterclass of disturbed realism.  You can feel the sickness melting off the walls and swallowing each and every scene.  The acting is also nearly flawless.  Miranda Richardson steals the whole show with a dual-role performance as the woman who poked all the holes in Spider's mind; his mother.  What she does for the film is immense, but the film cannot survive on the mood and performances alone.  Where the film fails is in the construction.  The jumbled reality that Spider creates for himself gets lost in the visual, remaining confusing and underdeveloped.  The flashbacks that become present-day reenactments become tiresomely crafted.  I wanted to indulge but I wound up wishing the film would just get on with it.

In the end it remains an interesting exercise and one that I would not be apposed to revisit.  Richardson is award worthy, and Fiennes works seemingly effortlessly to find depths within a nearly silent character, but the end result was rather tiresome and underwhelming considering the prose.

I just expected something more here.",1296432000,,2428,4.8024096385542165
1205155,5,B00000F4MA,"The rainy,grim,grey streets of East London,dominated by the Gasometers,streets of bricked-up windows and doorways,or unpeopled. Set in the late 50s of post-war desolation. Ralph Fiennes plays Dennis Clegg,inching his way slowly from the train to the half-way house for the mentally ill,between hospital and community,run by Mrs. Wilkinson(Lynne Redgrave),the formidable matriarch of fear. He mumbles hesitatingly. John Neville plays the loquacious,grandiose Terence,with the humour of the institutionalised who welcomes him to this Dickensian, ramshackle home. Clegg has been away in a mental institution for years. He is now returning to explore his memories, delusions,paranoid thoughts and fears of the trauma of his schizophrenic past. His notebook is used to record this journey into time and trauma. Jig-saw pieces filled in by conjecture. Isolated,lonely,with no friends to dispel his webby thoughts. As the sights and smells of a dank landscape permeate his fractured consciousness, Spider begins to recall his turbulent boyhood as the only child to an abusive plumber (Byrne) and his wife (Richardson).He explores the outer environment of caf's,pubs and canal seats,near to the environment he grew up in on the silk of memories.

Clegg has a deep love for his mother,who is the archetype for all women to him. He was closer to her than to his father. He believes his father(Byrne)Bill,killed his mother and took up with a tart. It seems that his mother(Richardson) and himself are neglected by an alcoholic husband and father. His mother has fondly called him `Spider', because of his love of cat's cradles and spider's webs. She becomes mixed up in his head with Yvonne, the tart,also played by Richardson,who Bill makes love to by the canal or at the allotment. He sees or hallucinates the killing of his mother by Bill. Yvonne comes to live with them,usurping his mother's role. Again what is real and what is delusion are hard to fathom. In the present,Yvonne soon inhabits Mrs. Wilkinson's role in the half-way house. He steals into her room planning to kill her. When she wakes up we see it's Redgrave's Mrs. Wilkinson. We also see the way Spider junior rigs string up to the gas supply and turns it on. The tart is killed but as his father drags her body out in the street,he is crying over Spider's mother's body. Through the protagonist's narrative, truth and illusion intertwine. The psychic events,the subjectivity of an unreliable narrator,drive this film slowly forward,memories distorted by perception. Hanging on a fragile precipice of Spider's creation,the film images represent the beliefs of what happened, to conceal what really happened.

As Spider delves deeper into his past his hallucinations escalate. Fiennes portrayal is his best ever,stripping away all the rhetoric of `acting',to become seemingly a real schizophrenic. The cinematography is 1st rate showing a reductive,realistic,impoverished environment. The music too is beautifully selected. Witness how `Silent Night' captures all the fled tenderness,Spider associates with his mother. Richardson is truly magnificent in 3 roles. Cronenburg has honed his art with a Beckettian austerity,bleak interiors,drab colours,no longer ram-raiding the subconscious,he uncovers and disentangles the psychology of a 'dead soul' beneath layers of paranoid schizophrenia,unravelling the disconnected psyche,spaced out for years on solitary musings in the hinterland of his mind. This has the clarity and sombreness of a masterpiece. Cronenburg's best film yet.",1291420800,,3537,5.511970534069982
1205156,5,B00000F4MA,"""Spider"" is a film that should be studied at length by any actor or aspiring actor, as well as by any serious filmmaker.  The three main  leads - Ralph Fiennes, Miranda Richardson, and Gabriel Byrnes - give performances of their careers.  David Cronenberg's extremely subtle direction develops from a screenplay written by the original novel's author, and every contributor to the film - photography, lighting, sets and costumes, and music - all come together to make this an incredible experience.

This is no Hollywood movie. There are no explosions or chases or gunfights. The development is slow, as some reviewers have complained. There's very definitely a plot, and a surprise ending, but viewers who may feel they have outwitted the film by having guessed the plot and ending in advance are missing the point, because the film is so much more than these. There are layers upon layers of meaning in every visual frame, every line of dialog, every facial expression and body language.

The film involves mental instability and confusion, but this is never attributed to schizophrenia as a specific diagnosis. If we think about it, how satisfied can we be that the ending has finally given us the ""reality"" of what has actually occurred? Why do certain characters appear in some scenes but not in others, and how does this relate to the flashbacks we are shown? How do the visuals in the opening credits help set the tone for the film? What is the significance of the jigsaw puzzle, and of the reassembling of the broken window? Do you suppose the window was ever actually reassembled in ""reality""? Near the beginning of the film we learn why the title of the film is ""Spider"", and how this name came to be, but what is the underlying significance of that name, which is not spelled out? How do the family dynamics in the film relate to Freudian theory, and how does the story told by the mother relate of either of these? What degree of reality or misinterpretation can we assign to what we are shown of each of the family members at various times? The role of the father is particularly nuanced and problematic. Can we assume that Lynn Redgrave's character represents a literal reality at all times? And in what way are the end credits deceptive?

This DVD comes with a commentary track and several supplementary extras. I strongly recommend that a viewer should simply watch the movie itself first, and mull it over. Then you should go back and watch the entire movie again, this time with the commentary soundtrack, together with the subtitles displaying the dialog, and then proceed to watch each of the interview featurettes provided. Doing this will address many of the questions you may have, or point out observations you may have missed, but will (or should) still leave many aspects of the film unsettled in your mind, to keep thinking about.",1287878400,,2857,4.808553971486762
1205157,5,B00000F4MA,"This is a film that you need to sit down and watch from begining to end without interuption.  It completely messes with the idea of the narrative because the story is told in the perspective of Ralph Fiennes's character, who was just released from an asylum.  As the story goes forth, the narrator confuses the audience by recognizing his mother (Miranda Richardson) with almost every other female character in the film.  The plot of the film ends up being completely different from the story in the end, leaving the viewer utterly speechless, but in contemplation.  I'll admit I only watched this film for Miranda Richardson, and this was probably one of the best performances I have seen her deliver.  A lot of reviewers state that she plays three different characters, when in fact she plays two and a half, because the last character she takes on has already been established.  This character has followed the story before Richardson steps into her shoes, but the viewer will notice that this final female is actually a mixture of the mistress and the housekeeper together.  Brilliant acting from all the actors, interesting and insightful cinematography.",1266364800,,1159,5.005208333333333

Several hours later, I started to watch the film again and followed storyline until I started seeing myself (my image, not actually me) on the screen and in the story (one role Miranda Richardson didn't play).  I took another break, but returned for the third installment and found myself so thoroughly engrossed that I sat there mesmorized drooling and mumbling to myself.

For me, this was a most difficult film to watch and I'm not sure why that is because I don't usually react to depressing storylines, bizarre characters or generally confusing staging and/or direction.

I may watch it a forth time (all the way through), but that's not going to happen soon.

Even though at first, it was like pulling teeth, I wound up admiring the Actors for having selected such difficult roles in a less than a mainline film, as well as the strong direction and story.",1263513600,2,1056,4.695652173913044
1205160,4,B00000F4MA,"The Bottom Line:

The mature Cronenberg who showed us two fine films in Eastern Promises and A History of Violence is very much in evidence here, abandoning his lifelong themes of the horror of the human body in favor of a more twisted study of mental illness; with a vulnerable and nuanced performance by Ralph Fiennes as our potentially unreliable narrator and very effective cinematography, Spider is a distinct and worthy horror film.

He likes to go into a picture that is hanging in this caf he visits. In the picture, he and 2 of his friends say and do the most hilariously perverse things to one another. Then Spider takes nudey pics out of his pants and it's flippin' uproarious
Spider likes to put together jigsaw puzzles but instead of taking a break when he gets stuck, he freaks out and throws the puzzle all over the floor! Missus whatshername yells at him that he has to pick all the pieces back up and you know damn well he's not going to do what she says.
Spider gets completely hypnotized by the gasworks across the street from his house, he just stands there and he can't even move. His best friend has to come and literally drag him back into the house. I think he killed his mom that way but I wonder if he knows. He must because he can't move when he looks at the gasworks. Yet his mind is working just like that gasworks, automatic. I'm still so confused and I've scene this bloody movie 5 times.
He smokes like a total fiend, so much so that his hands are all yellow, he'll smoke at really inappropriate times, too, like when he's laying in bed. He writes and writes and I'm not convinced yet that he can speak coherently. It's all face and eyes. Mostly eyes.
His hair cut makes him look like a little kid when it's clean and when his mate breaks a huge mirror and tries to kill himself, Spider steals (he's an expert theif) and then turns in the piece of glass he's stolen. But he can hardly speak, so damaged.
And when he takes a bath, he lays on his side in the rust stained water, completely still, joyless, cold. Hard.
You just want to heal this man, at least I wanted to. Ralph Fiennes (Super Hot? And what does that mean this time around?) is spot on as this afflicted damaged schizophrenic suffering and dangerous man. I've seen everything Fiennes has ever done and for me, this is IT.

The plot of the movie was decently involved (but not overwhelming).

Especially good points:

1. The characters were developed in a certain way to lead us to think one thing, but it later became clear that they were viewed through the lens of schizophrenia.

2. One woman played several characters, and she did a great job with all three of them. That was a testament to training and study!

3. The movie came together at the end in an ""Aha!"" sort of way. It is not one of those types of movies that would hve to be watched two or three times to put everything in place-- but not so pedestrian as to be boring.",1227744000,2,742,4.3478260869565215

It's difficult to describe the plot because, as others have said, it's complex and filled with twists that I really don't want to give away. So my only real option is to focus on the direction and acting, both of which are brilliant. This is a more restrained version of a Cronenberg movie, but no less interesting. He uses a massive amount of symbolism that makes you feel like you're inside a work of art, as opposed to just watching it.

The two best performances are from Miranda Richardson and Ralph Fiennes. Richardson plays three different characters (more of that symbolism) and by the end, manages to blend all three together into a sum where you can actually pick out what aspects belong to each character. It's a really incredible sight. Fiennes, on the other hand, goes in the opposite direction. He gets so into his character, it becomes totally and eerily believable. He barely says a single comprehensible word so the entire film relies on his body language. I think it's incredible that he carries the movie so well.

Some have said this film moves at a slow pace, but that wasn't the case for me. I was really interested in what was happening and what was going to happen, although I can understand that some might find it tough to sit through.

Your brain slowly turns to mush as he grinds down your power of perception.  Some might initially feel irritated with his warped little subterfuge, but what did you expect?  THIS IS CRONENBURG!!
Ralph Fiennes stars as Spider, an unstable man released from a mental institute in order to live in a halfway house.  Spider walks very slowly and his speech is often hard to decipher.  This made me wonder what was done to him in that insane asylum.  Nothing says I'm sorry like a free pass out of the nuthouse.
Anyway, Spider's new dwelling just happens to be near the place where he grew up.  He had a traumatic and mysterious childhood, and he never had the chance to piece some questions together.
Like one huge question--what happened to his mom?  Daddy replaced her with the local barfly as his mother disappeared without a trace.
You are dragged along on this quest for truth in surreal fashion.  Pieces of his memory and imagination distort this journey.  I totally love Cronenburg's distinctive style.  He never reveals too much too soon, always keeps you guessing.  This story seems hopelessly complex until you are able to break it down to its basic elements.  After I figured out what was going on, I actually had to rewatch a few scenes in order to fully grasp everything.  Cronie loves to get inside your head.",1199577600,2,1439,4.745967741935484

Take the time to pay attention and you will hopefully recognize the depth and mystery of this story.

He eventually kills this substitute as a vengeance but also as an act of justice for himself and maybe the mother he is remembering in his empty mind. He feels like a spider  in the middle of its cobweb, but also like the very prey of the spider in that very centre of that very cobweb. He will be taken away to some mental hospital and will come back a long long time later and he will revisit the scene of his crime and he will start all over again just to revive his past and what he lost a long time ago, his mother who is probably still alive in his mind, his memory. And he will be taken away again, this time for good. Sad vision of these men who are the prey of the world and become vultures because they are punished for what they did instead of being understood or just even being prevented from running into a situation of this type. Killing is a catching disease for one and an incurable disease for two. Cronenberg is the bleakest pessimist of them all and there is no escape from his fatal fate, his lethal death, his morbid moribund sense of black dis-humor that makes you feel as if you had eaten some live eel or snake, head, tail and venom alike.

French philosopher, Brillat-Savarin, probably said; ""There are some people whom it is one's duty to lock in cages and poke with sticks"". That aside, this is a truly beautiful and tragic work. I would echo M. J. Walters (dargelos) review below, but with one difference. I took it that the obscene cackling whores the boy first encounters on being sent to fetch his father home from the pub were real. It was a combination of the boy's identification of their gross and appalling behaviour as the sum of female sexuality together with the  realisation that his mother was also a sexual being that upset the balance of his mind with such disturbung consequences.

As for Ralph Fiennes performance, I can never forget the words put into Kate Winslett's mouth, via Ricky Gervias' 'Extras', that 'The quickest way to win an Oscar is to play a 'mental''. He did little more here than stagger around looking appalled, which most of us have done on a Saturday night before now. Gabriel Byrne's role was almost incidental as the father, except in that he was the obvious target and trigger of the mother's sexuality, but his working class London accent was pitch perfect.

1205233,3,B00000F4MA,"I'm not going to say I thought the film was brilliant, but it was interesting, and a very realistic depiction of madness.  Feinnes did his usual amazing job in a very difficult role, Miranda Richardson shifted back and forth nicely from the solidly middle-class good mother to the reptillian whore-mother.  Gabriel Byrne wasn't given much to do, and the boy who played Dennis did quite well.

However, I'm seeing reviews from people who simply didn't get this film at all, and I feared that might be the case though I don't think Cronenberg could've been more unambiguous about the identity of the women.  There was no prostitute, there was only his mother and his father.  The issues Dennis had with his mother's sexuality was the basis of of his madness.  When he sees his father murder his mother and replace her with a prostitute, it's in his imagination.  His parents' sex life effectively kills the good, non-sexual mother and replaces her with the bad whore-mother.  Both sides of the mother, whore and good mother, were played by Miranda Richardson.  And if that wasn't clear enough, by the end, Dennis is seeing the manager of the halfway house he's in with as this same whore-mother, also played by Miranda Richardson.

I understand that sometimes plots can throw people for a loop, but this sort of casting is, as I indicated, pretty unambiguous and that people aren't catching it suggests  that they're not paying adequate attention to the film.

Ralph Fiennes is an underappreciated actor with powerful dramatic skills, which are on full display here. These are the kind of roles in which truly talented actors shine in. The sparse dialouge requires Fiennes to portray his character without spitting out thoughts and feelings in words but rather in expression and body language, which in my opinion is far more difficult. Tom Hanks in Cast Away, Bill Murray in Lost in Translation are good examples of less is more such as this. I really enjoyed the supporting cast as well, Miranda Richardson and Gabriel Bryne are both excellent. Cronenberg is a genius surrounded by hacks when compared to the majority of living film directors, a brilliant and original maverick of the cinema.

I have read numerous fictional books about mental illness (I Never Promised You a Rose Garden; One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest; etc.) and seen some movies about the subject (A Beautiful Mind; Fight Club; etc) but I believe that this movie was the worst take on the theme that I have ever seen.

Ralf Fiennes plays a mentally disturbed man nicknamed ""Spider,"" whose childhood is reveled through flashbacks.  The movie moves very slowly and Fiennes' acting is not impressive: he just walks around and mumbers for most of the movie.  There is even a scene where, for no reason, he takes off his clothes and covers himself with curtains or something.  I have no idea why this was in the movie.

The flashback scenes deal mostly with Spider's father who in one scene kills his mother and takes up with another woman.  Supposively, these events were not what really happened, but only the distorted views from Spider's mental illness, but this concept isn't convincing and is only clear up briefly at the end of the movie.  So basically, through the whole movie, spider's father just seems like a terrible person and terrible human being in general which makes this one of the most depressing movies that I have ever seen.

This movie is really a downer that will likely disturb you for a few days after watching it.  It isn't an introspective look into mental illness; it is just a cheap, dark, artsy-fartsy movie.

His disturbing look into the twisted ways of society are some of the most disturbing and eye-opening films ever made. Spider takes a different direction in Cronenberg's filmmaking. The film is a character study of man with schitsophrenia trying to relive his childhood but all of his memories of it are wrong.

 The film is about ""Spider"" Cleg, a man who has extreme schitsophrenia.

He moves in to the house, which is run by Mrs. Wilkinson, and tries to mix with the others living in the household. He begins to relive his childhood in his mind.

While the film is undeniably powerful, and Fiennes' performance deserves an Oscar, there is a certain malaise (perhaps deliberate) about it which reveals a certain laziness in direction.  ""Spider"" the novel is as distant from ""Spider"" the film as ""The Metamorphosis"" is from ""Kafka"" starring Jeremy Irons.
Fiennes' character, Spider, is borderline insane.  He has one foot in reality and one foot in his horrific memories of a sordid, miserable, neglected and misunderstood youth.  The best parts of the film are the scenes in which Spider stands outside the scenes of his past, reciting verbatim the dialogue between his father, mother, and his repulsive mistress.  The ugly reality of insanity is presented here with no romantic embellishment; Spider is deranged, and does not understand the motives behind his own actions.  Awash in misery, the mood of each scene is more or less consistent: tragedy and confusion.  The only parts which even approach humor consist of Spider's entrance to the madhouse.
We feel sympathy for Spider, but for practically no one else in the film (except at the end, which reveals the somewhat predictable truth behind the murder of his mother.) Cronenberg tried a little to hard to shove the viewer's face in every nasty form of human behavior: alcoholism, degenerate sexual encounters (between his father and his real or unreal mistress), domestic abuse, etc.  The mood is almost TOO much Beckett.
Nonetheless, this is a film that deserves to be watched, if only for some scattered scenes and am ambiance of degeneration I have rarely seen in a film.

1205325,5,B00000F4MA,"Every once in awhile I like to watch a David Cronenberg film. One thing you will always get from a Cronenberg film is a serious look at how technology and human beings interact. Like science fiction author J.G. Ballard, Cronenberg's films embrace a synthesis of man and machine that is exceedingly grim, an outlook usually complimented with generous helpings of gore. The overarching theme in his cinematic examinations seems to be that humans simply do not know enough about the technology they develop, or if they do, their arrogance in the ultimate abilities of mankind always leads them charging into experiments despite the risks. That we are just not far seeing enough to predict the outcome of using new drugs or messing around with human genetics may be a good message to take from a Cronenberg film. ""Spider"" is a departure from the above traits, resembling ""Dead Ringers"" more than it does ""Scanners,"" ""Shivers,"" or other Cronenberg films. The film is an adaptation of a novel of the same name by Patrick McGrath, a novel that takes as its central theme the devastating consequences of mental illness.
Meet Dennis ""Spider"" Cleg (Ralph Fiennes), a guy with more problems than you could possibly fathom. Spider is mentally ill, a result of a problematic childhood and a horrific incident that caused his fragile mind to finally crack. When we first meet Spider he's just gotten out of the asylum and is checking into a half way house in the hope that he is finally ready to rejoin society. It's difficult to imagine Spider is ready for anything seeing as how he barely talks, spends most of his time scrawling doggerel into a tiny notebook, and has occasional outbursts of hysteric hostility over such mundane incidents as a small whiff of heating gas. Still, what do we know about mental illness? Maybe he really is ready to confront his dark past and the complexities of the modern world. In the meantime, Spider deals with the stern taskmaster in charge of the halfway house (Lynn Redgrave) and its kooky residents. As he lives in his largely internal world, Spider begins to remember his early life, the world he knew before the darkness stole over his mind and robbed him of his faculties. It's a dark world indeed, a world Spider needs to recall if he is to become healthy again.
It turns out that Spider's father and his mother had a highly unpleasant relationship. The mother adores her son, fondly nicknaming him ""Spider"" and doting on him whenever possible. His father Bill, on the other hand, is a cold, aloof man who seems as though he cannot stand the banalities of living with his wife and his son. Spider soon learns his father is up to no good when he sees his dad at the pub associating with a grotesque, bleach blonde prostitute of decidedly icky appearance named Yvonne. One thing leads to another, as adultery often does, and the elder Cleg and the tart consummate their relationship in a particularly sordid way (check out what she throws into the river! Yuck!). Then the madness begins. The prostitute and Spider's father decide to live together as man and wife, a definite problem considering there is already a spouse living under the Cleg roof. Murder is the answer, and murder becomes the solution as Spider's mother dies at the hands of her husband and his new lover. Even worse, Bill and Yvonne want Spider to accept them as his parents, something the boy adamantly refuses to do. Young Dennis decides to take matters into his own hands using his knowledge of making ""webs"" out of household twine, thus concocting a little surprise for Bill and Yvonne. I'm not going to tell you anything more beyond this point except to say you simply MUST watch this movie. Go out right now and rent it, this second, so you can watch it right away.
""Spider"" is a film that punishes you for complacency. I should have known better considering my experience with Cronenberg films, but I simply popped this disc in the player, set back, and accepted on face value everything I saw. BIG MISTAKE. Nothing is what it seems in ""Spider,"" absolutely nothing. Not until the movie neared the explosive revelation at the conclusion of the film did I begin to grasp the reality of the whole thing. Then I howled with surprise and understanding, suddenly remembering all of the clues Cronenberg placed at strategic points throughout the film to help his audience figure it all out. You will probably do the same thing, and that's o.k. since it's what makes the whole thing so much fun. Until you understand what the heck is going on, enjoy the blasted landscapes of London and the phenomenal performances from the stellar cast. Gabriel Byrne plays Bill Cleg like a pro, Miranda Richardson turns in the performance--actually three performances, by the way--of a lifetime. Ralph Fiennes as the disabled Spider really steals the show. We all know he can act because we saw him in ""Schindler's List,"" but he trumps even that performance here. His acting is Oscar worthy, and that's an understatement.
The DVD edition provides plenty of extras explaining nearly everything you would want to know about the movie. There's a lengthy Cronenberg interview where the director explains the difficulties he encountered bringing the film to fruition, a commentary track, a behind the scenes featurette, a trailer, a widescreen picture transfer, and interviews with the cast. Don't even listen to the people who say they hate this film; they simply don't know what they're talking about. ""Spider"" may well be Cronenberg's best film in his long career, and that's saying something. Brilliant, this one, and well worth owning. Now get out and watch it!",1078099200,5,5643,4.836608066184074
1205326,3,B00000F4MA,"Recently released from a mental institution, Dennis 'Spider' Cleg is assigned to a halfway house beside an ominous-looking gasworks in London's East End. He spends the first twenty minutes of the film muttering incomprehensibly and scribbling in no known language in his notebook. Why was he committed? Why has he been released? What will he do now? We soon discover we aren't going to be told these things - we're going to be shown. As Spider revisits the sites of his early childhood, memories of the past and experiences of the present dramatically merge, and it becomes clear that he's once again losing his mind. ""Spider"" is interesting mainly for its artful attempts, in both production and performance, to externalize the experience of schizophrenia. Ralph Fiennes gives a daring performance in the lead role, and Miranda Richardson is wonderful playing two very different characters who are conflated in the young Spider's mind. Cronenberg's London is appropriately frightening - deserted, mysterious and sinister - and Peter Suschitzky's thoughtful camerawork makes a convincing tilt at representing a mind on the brink of insanity. As other reviewers have noted, Cronenberg's strategy here is to present a shifting ""reality"" that's deliberately unreliable, until the veracity of everything is called into question. It's an interesting cinematic experiment. Ultimately, though, it's this very unreliability that undermines ""Spider"" as a piece of storytelling. When none of the evidence can be trusted, most of the pleasures associated with watching a mystery story unfold - anticipation, suspicion, suspense and surprise - simply fade away. It gets dull. Very dull. And there's little in the way of action or drama to lift the pace. Overall, ""Spider"" is a technically compelling but not quite engaging film. If you're interested in filmmaking, adaptation, unreliable narrative, or the way in which all aspects of a film's realization can be interestingly deployed in pursuit of a single theme, then you'll probably find ""Spider"" an absorbing night's viewing and a film you'll want to own. But if you're looking for what's usually meant by ""a brilliant and powerful psychological thriller"", this isn't one. Which is no surprise, really: since when was the lived experience of schizophrenia ""entertaining""?",1074988800,2,2313,5.392265193370166
1205327,5,B00000F4MA,"From the opening frames of the credits, the church hymn, the Rorschach prints and the measured and precise pacing of them, we are entering a world of a severely disengaged man, who has had the spectre of schizophrenia as his constant companion, both in his waking and sleeping hours. The mumblings and rememberances of Dennis Clegg (Ralph Fiennes) combine to make for a journey down Memory Lane that is unlike any that rational, thinking people would care to take, let alone inhabit and from which there is very little chance of escape.
Fiennes spends the length of the film attempting to piece together bits and pieces of times past in his childhood, that may or may not have happened. The prize in this herculanean effort is not so much to discover the unseemly goings on of his father, but rather seeking a discourse into the inner workings of Clegg's mind and what it potentially holds and abandons at will.
Dennis Clegg has been released into the care of a matron (Lynn Redgrave) in a halfway house in a decaying, dying section of London, that has become the home, heart and soul for others of his ilk; the mentally disabled, discharged from the asylum, but not quite ready for habitation in the outside world at large. His lodgings represent the underbelly of a netherworld that caters to no one and where rehabilitation is a foreign word, absent from the vocabulary of those in charge.
Redgrave plays Mrs. Wilkinson, the spawn of Nurse Ratchet, with a demeanor as cold as the grave and as uncaring as any you are likely to see. Hers is a job, nothing more, nothing less; an automaton in the flesh. John Neville (teamed again with Fiennes. He was in Sunshine.) as Terrance, another resident of the house, has etched a character who sums up the medicated and serene patient seen as a non-threat to the establishment, but who attempts to warn Clegg of the queenly attitudes of Wilkinson and the powers she holds. This British character actor's small part in this film is a gem deserving of recognition.
Every movement that Clegg makes is guaranteed to bear witness to a recollection and to focus on events as perceived in his ever crumbling mind. Once his journey into neverland begins, we are brought along ever so slowly so that we capture these moments precisely and without seeing error. We learn that his mother, as played by Miranda Richardson, had nicknamed him Spider and it is through his newly gained name that his mannerisms take on the skin of the animal. Each newly remembered facet of his world is honed on the impressions of a spider web -- the string, broken
glass, the jigsaw puzzle, the string game he plays at the kitchen table -- spiraling and spinning the child and the man into its deadly web and further from reality as we know it.
Richardson portrays three multi-faceted characters in this film, three spirits, and with each one she sheds a skin and grows another, entirely different in bearing and manner. It is a tour de force performance. Gabriel Bryne as Bill Clegg is dark and daunting, shown as a family man bored and tired with the mundance existance that is his life. Or is he?
The performance of Bradley Hall as the young Spider is eerie and precisely on the money. You can feel a kindred spirit between his child Spider and the adult that he is to become in Ralph Fiennes.
The best has been saved for last and that honour belongs to Ralph Fiennes. His Spider is haunted and haunting, gritty and realistic. This crumbling vestige of a man has been finely honed and not once did I think that I was watching a performance but rather as true a representation of a schizophrenic as one is able to command. It is not a glamour role or a safe role, not a trace of pretty boy about it and thank god, none attempting to project itself from the proceedings! Fiennes, who is known for the research he puts into his roles, has scored all aces with this one.
Another added plus is that Hollywood has not managed to ruin a good thing -- a film that truly makes one THINK about what they have just seen. I cannot help but put another role as a schizophrenic into play -- that of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind. When you see these two films and attempt to add the similarities, about the only one that comes to mind IS the fact that schizophrenics are being represented and nothing more. Fiennes has left, for all intents and purposes, Crowe's portrayal in the dust, and if Hollywood has any guts come Oscar nomination time, they will credit a true acting triumph, rather than the orchestrated ones that usually win because of huge studio mounted pushes. Spider is the little film that could, did and should.
Spider is not an easy film to watch, but then seeing madness never is. There are those who will be turned off by it, or perhaps momentarily subjected to moments of quiet. Then again, others will cheer a peformance that is worthy of the accolade, a job very well done indeed! BRAVO! Cronenberg, as director, has launched a film that is as subdued and unassuming as a breath of air as it brushes past a cheek. The hollow streets, the absence of crowds and the delicate renderings of cast and crew alike, have conveyed a dream or as some would insist, a nightmare and
forsaken a Hollywood beginning, middle and end.
I sincerely hope that Spider is not lost in the shuffle of films that will spill forth over the course of the spring, or be considered as ""too arthouse"" to warrant consideration by other than those who know absolute talent when it is put in front of them. This film is not ""entertainment"" per se, and that would be the wrong word to use. Rather, eye opening and thought provoking would be a more apt description. It's a step on the edge of the abyss and the eventual and catastrophic conclusion that must become Spider's reality.
It is minimalist and daring and I can't say strongly enough how much this ensemble cast has brought forth for our inspection. See this film and be amazed at it in all its consummate glory!",1074643200,4,5965,4.580916744621141

Spider recalls his past, particularly the relationship between his mother (played brilliantly by Miranda Richardson - who plays multiple roles in the film) and his father (played by Gabriel Byrne) while he was a small boy.  Young spider is played by Bradley Hall a boy who's trying to deal with the confusing world around him.  It's a remarkable performance for this young actor's film debut.  The film's quite thought-provoking and ends up playing out like a mystery, to see how a young boy became the Spider he is today.",1069977600,2,909,4.908496732026144
1205352,3,B00000F4MA,"I wasn't sure what to make of Spider before I saw it, and, frankly, I feel the same way afterwards.  Spider is an attempt to bring the audience into the mind of a mentally disturbed man, Spider, who has just been released--prematurely it would seem--from a mental institution, and finds himself drifting about between a halfway house and the familiar places from his childhood.  Ralph Fiennes' nuanced, if mumbly, performance as Spider interested me, but the slow, langorous pace was difficult to deal with.  We begin witnessing Spider's childhood and the events that may, or may not, have precipitated his madness.
And he is mad, scribbling nonsense hieroglyphics in a tattered notebook, mumbling about this or that, assembling a jigsaw puzzle, and then trashing it, with strange intensity, wearing eight or nine shirts simultaneously, wrapping old newspaper and twine around his torso--you get the picture.
But the clever conceit of Spider is trying to understand what is true, and what is not, about Spider's childhood recollections.  Did witnessing a violent event warp his mind?  Or was it a gas leak from the stove?  Or was it guilt over an extraordinary crime?  Was it the prostitute who flashes her breast at the quiet, friendless little boy?  Or was he just born that way?  The truth slowly--and I mean slowly--unravels, until we realize the depths of Spider's schizophrenia, and perhaps understand the disease just a little more than when the movie started--what seemed like hours and hours and hours ago.
This is a brave attempt at insight, and it succeeds on some levels.  Certainly, it seems driven by artistic vision, not box office success, and that, alone, is about as much nobility as we expect from film.  So watch it, for the gems it presents; understand that it isn't perfect; enjoy the rich cinematography, too.",1069459200,6,1832,5.013201320132013
1205353,4,B00000F4MA,"Though this movie is rated R, as a fact is a movie suitable for all, I mean this is a David Cronenberg movie and a lot of people are scared simply by knowing he is directing; though Cronenberg continues to explore the dangers inside of the human mind, Spider is the more sober film ever shot by the canadian filmmaker. The film has a great cast: Ralph Fiennes, Miranda Richardson and Gabriel Byrne aren't big stars but are great actors indeed. It's really strange that this movie - presented at Cannes last year - didn't gathered awards: directing, cinematography, screenplay, acting are all first class here: everything contributes creating the best cinematic represenation of schizofrenia ever.
The DVD is very good. The video track makes justice to the moving image while the audio track - though this isn't a film you can expect a lot of surround work - offers clear dialogues and it's involving with the essential Howard Shore music. The extras are interesting, especially the commentary by Cronenberg.

1205354,4,B00000F4MA,"This is a disturbing film because its depiction of madness conveys an astonishing realism. Director, David Cronenberg, (Crash, Naked Lunch and The Fly) has managed to merge the leading character's disquieting mind with the audience. This is no small task considering the subject matter, and the fact that the protagonist is suffering from intense delusions concerning his past. We see through the eyes of Spider - the memories of his childhood, though as the tale unfolds, we begin to distrust his memories and see that they blend with fantasy. The film is a study on the mechanics of repression, and the psychological notion that memory cannot be trusted.
Spider (Ralph Fiennes) arrives at a halfway house somewhere in London. Mrs Wilkinson, (Lynne Redgrave) meets him at the door. This woman is everything you would expect from a proprietor of a house for newly released mental patients. It is here that we begin to learn of Spider's childhood: his relationship with his mother and father, which is the key to the cause of his present condition. Miranda Richardson plays three different roles in the film - Spider's mother, the prostitute and later, the proprietor of the halfway house. The mother and the prostitute are entirely different, but the proprietor is an impressive blending of all three. As we learn more about Spider's childhood, we really don't know what to make of his father (Gabriel Burne)...is he an abusive man, an adulterer and drunk or merely a man doing his best to cope with an unhappy marriage? Gabriel Burne admitted that this was one of the hardest roles he's had to do, because he had to play the character on a fine line, so as not to give anything away to the audience. When you see the end of the film, you'll agree that he succeeded in his intended performance.
David Cronenberg is well known for his fascination with the darker more disturbing aspect of the human mind. He's one of those unique directors that will capture the right atmosphere for the subject under study; in this case, madness is realistically represented and seems to exude that strange feeling of the uncanny. A good example is the scene where Spider lays in the bathtub in the foetus position, blankly gazing into space. This is a disturbing image of a lost soul in the throes of passive insanity.
I would not say that this picture is an enjoyable one, but it is certainly an intriguing journey into a troubled mind, attempting to come to terms with his past and the truth.",1067558400,23,2478,4.792056074766355

It is watching Fiennes that really made the movie come alive for me.  He presents the schizophrenic character so perfectly, facial expressions, body language, mannerisms, the entire persona is so believable even though he says very little direct dialogue.  His first appearance, soon after the start, sets the scene, a train arrives at a London terminal, the passengers stream past the camera until the platform is empty and then Spider steps down from the carriage, immediately you sense that here is a person who is different and you're hooked.  I would suggest that this movie is recommended viewing for every acting/drama class in the country.

1205356,2,B00000F4MA,"I got crunched for time and was not able to view the special features of the DVD where the movie was explained.  Both my wife & I did not understand what happened.  While I understand the critical embrace that many give the film, a movie that must be explained to be understood is not successful.
It's always difficult to have a protagonist who is mentally ill.  A story like Spider would do better where there are characters like in ""A Beautiful Mind"" or ""Iris"" through whom the audience gains stability in understanding the material.  Instead, while there is a full exploration of the character by Ralph Fiennes' excellent job of acting, we didn't understand whether he really murdered his mother or whether his father had.  Miranda Richardson's performance is incredible.  I really had no clue that Mrs. Cleg and Yvonne the bargirl were played by the same person.  They seemed to be two completely separate individuals to me.  Young Bradley Hall seemed the sanest of all the characters to me, enduring quite a bit from his father played by Gabriel Byrne.  Lynn Redgrave did a great job as Mrs. Wilkinson, but I had no clue why Yvonne suddenly was seen as Mrs. Wilkinson.
The one aspect of the film that I did appreciate was the cinematography.  This film is a thousand pictures, beautifully and starkly filmed.

1205358,5,B00000F4MA,"...and that takes absolutely NOTHING away from the stunning contributions from everyone involved in this project.  As soon as I read Patrick McGrath's incredible novel a few years ago, I knew I had discovered something wonderfully unique - then I read that there were plans for a film, with McGrath writing the screenplay - and when the pieces began to fall into place (Ralph Fiennes in the title role, along with Miranda Richardson and Lynn Redgrave, with David Cronenberg directing) I knew that the film would be something very special indeed.  I was almost afraid to see it when it appeared in theatres (delayed for months in the US after its European release, evidently to keep it from being confused with SPIDER-MAN) - I feared that I had built up my expectations to a degree that they could not be fulfilled.  I needn't have worried - the film floored me completely, from the performances by the great actors named above, to Cronenberg's masterful direction, to the perfect set design, Howard Shore's dead-on score, everything.  This is as perfect an adaptation as a film could be.  I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out, so I could view the film and have the ability to stop it and run it back in order to absorb all of its nuances.
It's also a difficult review to write - the plot twists are so delicious, and so perfectly rendered in the film, but to reveal too much about them would spoil it for any potential viewers.  I'll try my best not to do that - I don't want to deprive anyone of the full effect.  I have to agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer below when he states that `Hitchcock would have killed' to direct this story, and that it quite possibly surpasses anything that Hitchcock ever did (how many contemporary films could you say THAT about, and mean it...?).
According to Cronenberg's commentary on the DVD, when the script was sent to him, Ralph Fiennes had already decided that he wanted to play the part.  Cronenberg stated `...two pages into the script, I knew that no one else could do it'.  Plagued with financing difficulties - the director said that the financing actually had to be acquired a second time, after some sources backed out - it's a wonder the film was made at all.  The cast and the director deferred their salaries, making it possible - and turning the project into a true labor of love.  We owe them a debt of gratitude for their dedication and sacrifice.
`Spider' is Dennis Cleg - a man just released from a mental asylum to live in a halfway house in London's East End, very near his childhood neighborhood.  Fiennes slips into the role completely - he pulls every ounce of the character's fiber out of the script, and added some touches of his own (the constant muttering was his idea) to round it out perfectly.  Spider had a troubled childhood - as is evident from the memories that haunt him.  The question is, which ones are real and which ones are manufactured...?  As the story progresses, the web gets more and more intricate.  Cronenberg films Spider in various environments - the halfway house day room, as well as his private room;  on the streets in his neighborhood;  in a local caf, as well as the pub his dad used to frequent.  All of these places trigger memories in him. He sees the characters from his past - his dad and mum, the `cheap tart' Yvonne - appear before him as if it were yesterday again.  We see the adult Spider looking in through the kitchen window of his boyhood home, watching his mum and dad and himself as a child having dinner.  He eavesdrops on their conversations, mumbling lines from each character before they speak them.  Each place that he goes caused more doors of his memory to open - he tries desperately to put the pieces together, and it's a painful struggle, very difficult to watch.
I can't stress enough how mesmerizing Ralph Fiennes is in this role - watching him, it's very easy to completely forget that it's an actor playing a part. Miranda Richardson is stunning in multiple roles - she plays Spider's mum, as well as the tart Yvonne...and she makes an appearance, briefly, as a third character (watch for it!).  Lynn Redgrave has long been admired as a masterful actor - she brings the perfect combination of authority and coldness to her portrayal of Mrs Wilkinson, with a dash of cruelty and seductiveness thrown in.  The subtleties she invokes are amazing.  Gabriel Byrne does a very nice job indeed in a difficult role as Spider's dad - he has to portray his character both as he is and as he is imagined and remembered, and he does it with a naturalness that betrays the daunting task.  Bradley Hall, the young actor who portrays Spider as a child, combines loneliness, vulnerability, desperation, fear and an aching need to understand what is going on in his family and his world - amazing work from one so young.  John Neville is very effective as Spider's fellow halfway house dweller Terrence - `...we're not to be trusted, are we, Terrence...?' muses Mrs Wilkinson when she introduces the two.  Terrence speaks a line that is very evocative of the isolation and pain felt by victims of schizophrenia, when he tells Spider, `...it's a loud world.'
I can't say enough about this incredible film - but I know I don't want to inadvertently give too much away, and I know I'm approaching my word-count limit.  Pass it by at your peril - the DVD is beautifully rendered, with great bonus material - but should you ever get the chance, see this one on the big screen.  It wasn't a box-office smash - and the public once again has ignored a masterpiece.",1064361600,35,5572,4.616008105369808

WARNING: Some of the reviewers have given away the secrets and plot twists to this amazing pyschological thriller. BE CAREFUL or this may ruin your viewing experience. One of the joys of this film for me was the revelation of themes and the mystery of Spider's delusional mind. Having heard very little about this film even after hearing Cronenberg talk on NPR, this film took me by complete surprise. The ending absolutely fooled me and the method Cronenberg uses to reveal Spider's delusion is brilliant. I still did not know about this device until the credits were rolling. I felt naive because it all seemed so obvious. This is what I love about film. Being duped. Thanks, Cronenberg! (I hope I haven't given anything away.)
As stated before, this is a bleak mood piece about a schizophrenic ghost of a man who is released from an asylum. Plagued by visions of his childhood, he slowly reenacts the apparent cause of his insanity. It's a very barren and minimalist piece of film making that is not for everyone. The performances are flawless. The pallette is dark and drab. The pacing is slow. The images are stark and brooding. The image of Spider scrawling in his mad hieroglyphic diary with smoke stained hands against a dirty wall framed in heavy shadow left me breathless. It's a scene of isolated madness like no other.
I have never considered myself a big fan of Cronenberg. I've always loved THE FLY. NAKED LUNCH left me confused. The William Burroughs novel of the same name is stream of consciousness nightmare vision and almost impossible to translate into film. Very brave of Cronenberg to try. DEAD RINGERS was disturbingly delicious. But SPIDER may be Cronenberg's best film. If he were to make another film as stunning as this one I just might become one of his biggest fans.
This film is for adults who like mystery, themes of madness, and smart mood pieces. Teenagers or others looking for a standard horror movie may want to look elsewhere.
WATCHING THE CONCLUSION I FELT AS IF I HAD WITNESSED SOMETHING HITCHCOCK WOULD HAVE KILLED TO DIRECT, HAD HE STILL BEEN ALIVE. THIS FILM MAY EVEN SURPASS ANYTHING OF PSYCHOLOGICAL SUSPENSE THE MASTER MAY HAVE DIRECTED. BRAVO, CRONENBERG! CHEERS, TO RALPH AND MIRANDA!
HITCH WOULD HAVE LOVED THIS.",1063324800,7,2322,4.793017456359102
1205361,5,B00000F4MA,"This movie is a strange mood piece with a tremendous performance by Ralph Fiennes as a man who's been released from a mental institution and has returned to the London neighborhood where he grew up. The nature of his illness is deliberately unclear. We simply watch as familiar surroundings trigger disturbing memories of his boyhood, and through them we slowly piece together his story.
The mood is set by a long, long tracking shot as the movie begins, as passengers disembark from a train in a large London terminal. The camera seems to be searching through this throng for someone in particular, and after what seems like an eternity, Fiennes as Spider emerges painfully and awkwardly onto the platform with a beat-up suitcase.  And we are plunged from a scene of everyday activity into his world, which is far, far removed from the everyday and ordinary.
There's a twilight-zone kind of ambiance in the movie, as the camera shows us interiors and exteriors that are typically empty of furnishings and people. Street scenes, for instance, have no passing traffic, no pedestrians, not even cars parked at curbs. The lighting is often like stage lighting, coming from unexpected sources and providing an eerie flatness. The soundtrack alternates between strange rumbling noises, a small group of strings experimenting with mournful dissonance, and a lovely old-fashioned ballad that Spider remembers from childhood.
The supporting actors are wonderful, as they waver in our perception between what their characters really are and how they appear to Spider. Miranda Richardson has the task of playing three different characters, each as Spider sees them. Gabriel Byrne and Lynne Redgrave in brief scenes give richly nuanced performances. As with many indie movies, the commentary and other features on the DVD provide further interesting insights.
This is not a movie for an audience looking for entertainment. It is a psychological study and something of a mystery, as we make what sense we can of what the movie slowly reveals of its central character. I recommend it to anyone fascinated by the darker sides of the human psyche, the puzzle of mental illness, and the strange ways that the everyday world can be transformed by a troubled and isolated point of view.",1061510400,36,2268,5.096774193548387
7907256,4,B00000F4MA,"I enjoyed the movie. I think the characters were played well, the scenes fleshed out, the storyline, grim. I think those who like dark, psychologically-driven cinema will find this movie to be fulfilling. It has moments that would likely lead casual viewers to feel discomforted, though that isn't a theme foreign to other Cronenberg pictures. If you are a Cronenberg fan, this movie is worth watching, in order to form your own opinion about. If you are not a fan or aren't privy to his earlier works, I'd still try it out. It's unconventional, with an atmosphere that is fairly enthralling.",1521590400,,592,4.871287128712871

7907260,1,B00000F4MA,"I like a number of Cronenberg's films, but this one is awful. It's slow, grimy, and unremittingly depressing. The ""secret"" of Dennis' madness is obvious halfway through the film, as a result of casting Richardson in two roles. When Dennis' father strikes his mother with a shovel, buries her and takes up with the prostitute, it's obvious that Dennis' distinction between the two Miranda characters is delusional. And it's obvious that Dennis is going to murder mother, father or both. You sit through the last half of the film to see how the murder occurs, which is a waste of 45 minutes, because nothing about the murder or what leads up to it sheds any insight on Dennis or the human condition. Watch A History of Violence or Dead Ringers instead.",1477267200,,750,4.732824427480916
7907261,5,B00000F4MA,"Watching the scenes unfold was close to a ""horror movie"" type drama where you just can't seem to look away. The notion that criminals ""cannot remember"" evil acts committed is carefully revealed in this masterful story. How the reactive mind contains those pictures which are not available to the Analytical Mind. Yes, this movie is at times shocking but none the less an excellent choice. What very few people get is that he is about to commit yet another horrific crime, and this my psycho babble bubble heads (Psychiatry/psychology) is the cycle.",1471219200,,548,4.967391304347826
