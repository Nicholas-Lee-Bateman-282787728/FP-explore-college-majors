7013534,3,B00TP5Y4AI,"Ralphie (Mark Drake) has bad dreams and undergoes life regression conducted by his friend Claudia (Rosie Akerman) reading from a book. Unlike most people undergoing regression and being the King of Atlantis, he was a Nazi. He was involved in a project called ""Operation Community"" which was designed to create terror in England prior to the invasion. Meanwhile Ralphie's girlfriend Andrea (Sophie Barker) a Brighton girl, is cheating with Lucas (Miles Jovian) who is Chloe's boyfriend,

Ralphie's visions takes them to a rural area of England as they search for his past life and giving Lucas and Andrea to do their rabbit thing. In a subplot, there is a unseen man contacting demons(?) through a black mirror with Nazi symbols so he can enact revenge. The two come together in a slightly unexpected manner resulting in a torture scene that was so-so.

The film incorporates a unique script, but fails to deliver the goods. The intensity wasn't felt. And PLOT SPOILER what was that scene where we see Lucas' junk as he is clearly naked, and then later he is wearing underwear? Plot continuity, Please.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, brief Miles Jovian's junk.",1425600000,2,1149,4.973958333333333

8702466,1,B00TP5Y4AI,"I should pay more attention to genre.  I would call this torture porn, and it is horrifying.  Enough--won't watch the whole thing.",1466553600,2,130,4.863636363636363
8702467,3,B00TP5Y4AI,"Plot rather weak combined with the typical Hollywood twist in tales. Somewhat correct as we do return in groups, some small as 24 others as large as 144 souls. The study and practice of Reincarnation is more accepted today, especially by the medical community of psychologist and psychiatrist. Example: Dr. Brian Weiss. Take a moment to check it for yourself.",1463097600,,359,5.0

8702474,3,B00TP5Y4AI,"It is an elevated suspense story with heavy metaphysical properties guiding a very psychological desire for vengeance. The plot revolves around a group of friends who set out to explore the reality behind one members regression story that dates back to World War II. The trip leads them into a nightmare where they are still very much behind enemy territory. (Cheesy I know but I just had to )

Unfortunately this film maintains a more PG-13 tone both visually and in dialog. The real excitement shows up in the final act of the film when the stories collide with some visceral, gritty horror driven moments. There isn't really any gore or heavy torture, but the attitude and feel of the final scenes hint to it. Overall Backtrack is a soft paranormal thriller, that is more closer to films like The Innkeepers as far as horror is concerned.",1430870400,2,841,4.72108843537415
