5257457,4,B00947NAHU,"The latest Quentin Tarantino bloodfest combines Sergio Leone's ""Man With No Name"" films with some of 1975's ""Mandingo"" then stirs it all up with goodly doses of Mel Brooks ""Blazing Saddles."" Somehow it all works.

Jamie Foxx stars in the Clint Eastwood-like role as Django. But unlike Clint, Django is a slave, 2 years before the Civil War. The film opens ""somewhere in Texas."" Django is freed by a bounty hunter and former dentist from Germany, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). They form a pact whereby Django will identify and help kill 3 brothers that will return a $7000 bounty. In return, Schultz will share the bounty, give him a horse and perhaps rescue Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a rich plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).

The pair have a couple pit stops along the way including one at a plantation owned by a Col. Sanders double named ""Big Daddy"" played for all its worth by Don Johnson. During this segment, there is a hilarious bit (partially seen in trailers) where Big Daddy & his KKKlansmen set out to kill our duo. They spend more time trying to figure out how to see out of the eye slits on the hoods than having a good plan of attack. Tarantino, a known film buff even includes Italian actor Franco Nero as a Mandingo owner whose fighter is killed by Candie's man. Nero starred in a 1966 western called ""Django"" (look it up).

The real fun begins when Candie and Schultz play their verbal games. Candie is out of his league however. There is no one better than Waltz at delivering Tarantino's words and this film is no exception. He's really fun to watch and listen to. Django and Schultz almost pull off the purchase of a fighter, with the lovely Hildy being tossed in as a bonus. But Candie's old and ornery house slave (Samuel L. Jackson) smells something fishy and alerts him that he believes Hildy and Django are acquainted.

""Django Unchained"" has a great soundtrack, is very funny, profane and very, very violent complete with exaggerated gore and blood splattering. Also there is enough use of the then common racial epithet to fill up a dozen rap albums. The only scene that really bothered me was when Candie turns vicious dogs loose on an escaped slave. That was maybe a little too real but provides an honest history of the time and place. If you're a Tarantino fan you won't be disappointed. For others, be cautious.",1356652800,42,2395,4.695238095238095

5257459,5,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained might be the best movie I've seen all year, behind Lincoln, of course.

Jamie Foxx is superb as Django, a slave purchased by Dr. King Schultz (Christophe Waltz) who receives his freedom in exchange for assistance with bounty hunting. Django sets off with Dr. Schultz to murder wanted men and cash in on the bodies (such is bounty hunting). Of course, the time being 1858, 2 years before the Civil War in the South, there had to be some form of KKK around. In this case, nothing was funnier than watching Don Johnson and Jonah Hill try to ride around with sheets on their heads that they couldn't even see out of. That was the only humor I could find regarding the KKK, which I am grateful for. After of course killing Don Johnson's Colonel Sanders-looking slave owner, the two set off on a mission for the bounties that await.

After bounty hunting all winter, Django and Dr. Schultz set off for Greenville, Mississippi in search of Django's wife, Broomhilda, who had been sold to Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio in his best role yet). They set off to find her and to charm Mr. Candie into selling her to them. Samuel L. Jackson is Mr. Candie's house slave, head of the house. He has a big problem with Django being on a horse and being treated like white folk. He finds out that Broomhilda and Django are married and informs Mr. Candie that he is being swindled. Mr. Candie sells Broomhilda to Dr. Schultz but demands that Dr. Schultz shake his hand or the sale is not valid per Southern custom. Dr. Schultz kills him and then the great shootout ensues.

Long story short, Django rescues Broomhilda, there's a gruesome redneck bloodbath at the hands of Django and he rides off with his wife.

Lots of humor and the brutality of slave ownership was personified in this movie. I had only read the horror stories about slave treatment in books like Huckleberry Finn and Gone with the Wind, but never seen it on screen before. The harsh reality of the treatment of slaves like cattle and property by the rich plantation owners was brought to life. Leonardo DiCaprio truly was evil here. The moviegoing public is used to seeing him in films like Titanic and Blood Diamond, but never as brutal as the plantation owner. He was wonderfully cast and in my opinion, deserves an Oscar win for his performance. Dirty and slimy yet unhinged was the way to go here for Mr. Candie. The ""hot box"" scene was particularly gross, especially upon learning that a black man, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) ordered and carried out the punishment himself. Throwing Broomhilda into the hot box naked on a really hot Mississippi day was just nasty. Then of course the slave being ripped apart and eaten by rabid dogs was no picnic. The scene was reminiscent of Jezebel being torn apart by dogs in the Bible. The dogs were starved and greedily fed on the poor slave. That is one part of American history I wish had never happened.

Overall, the movie was great. Lots of dialogue, as is Quentin Tarantino's style, mixed in with surprising acts of violence and notable cameos by Bruce Dern and Russ Tamblyn. Not a movie for the kids. I wouldn't allow my 15 year old sister to see it either. I cringed and squirmed during the torture scenes and I can handle some pretty violent gruesome stuff, but seeing the horrors of slavery was too real for me I guess. I am going to buy this movie when it comes out on Blu Ray . Lots of humor and Jamie Foxx was at his best, after Ray.",1356652800,4,3460,4.538461538461538
5257460,1,B00947NAHU,"A very disjointed story line that went between spaghetti western to black funk film to a righteous moral tale, violence in the wrong places, Di Capricorn is great but the rest are wasted. save your money, not great,",1356652800,31,215,4.684210526315789
5257461,5,B00947NAHU,"Tarrantino is at it again with this sequel to his ""Inglorious Basterds."" And like it, Django too is a ""victim's redemption story."" Only this time the victimology does not involve Jewish revenge against Nazi ovens, but black revenge against plantation slave brutality. The vehicle here as before, is the now familiar but somewhat worn Western spaghetti trope -- slightly updated and modified: A slave is rescued from a chain gang heading deeper South - meaning to a more brutal Plantation. Django hooks up with a bounty hunter and they ride into several towns where Django ""gets to kill white people and get paid for it.""

As a pretext for what Tarentino's movies do best, they raid and kill their way across the plantation landscape from Texas to Tennessee. Ostensibly their loud blazing guns and dynamite are in search of certified ""bad guys,"" but in truth (and this is the underlying subtext) their overall mission is to ""even the score"" between the stripes on Django's back and the peace and tranquility of the Southern plantation way of life. Violence here is a purposeful morality rectifying and restoring tool.

As this dynamic duo go about the symbolic business of ""evening the moral score for all times,"" they also are in search of Django's wife who was ""sold South"" along with him. Along the way, they wreak untold havoc on plantation owners across a wide swath of Southern peace, tranquility and hospitality.

In one single symbolic stroke of the writer's pen, the picturesque exploits of a single symbolic slave/cowboy/bounty hunter, Django, sets the moral world upright against.

Commentary

At any time except Xmas and the aftermath of the wanton murders at ""Sandy Hook,"" Conn, this would have been an uninterrupted ""feel good movie."" However with those two things as a heavy-hearted backdrop, American violence can no longer in any sense be taken as being ""normal or culturally sane.""

In all of Tarrantino's movies including this one, he has been trying to tell us obliquely (which is the only way you can tell Americans anything) that the level and utter glee and enjoyment and celebration of violence in our culture may be normal for us, but it is utterly insane for any culture with its moral and human sensibility and its humanity still intact.

Somehow, we have failed to get his underlying message. We love violence because, its primary tool in our culture, the gun, is close to holiness, close to our hearts, intertwined with our history, and the answer to all our fears, prayers and problems. Some Americans get an orgasm just by holding an AR-15? We worship the gun like most religions worship its prophets, perhaps even more so, since there is only one Amendment to our Constitution that comes before ""the right to bear arms."" If that is not the very definition of an insane culture then would someone please stand up and tell me what is?

Anyone who wants to know why random acts of anti-kindness (as in brutal wanton murders against 20 kindergarteners) happen in this nation, need go no further than look directly into the mirror: We are a hate-filled nation perpetually living on moral credit, pretending to be much better than we are. We are good and moral only to the extent we tell ourselves it is so. We do not allow, nor will we ever abide being told anything other than what the distorted, lying mirror, mirror on the wall keeps telling us: that we are the fairest, greatest, most peace-loving nation of them all.

It is a lie and we know it and now with Sandy Hook, we also feel it deeply.

By the twisted logic of the established American norm, it is always a case of never mind the reality out there: That we stand alone as the country that has been in more wars than any nation in the history of the world; that the murders we commit against each other every year since WW-II is by a ""factor of ten"" more than all of the European countries (with Canada, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Australia thrown in) combined; that we are one of the most hate-filled nations in the world; and that random, wanton and rampant gun violence such as occurred at Sandy Hook is just the ""new normal"" for us. [Get over it, right?]

Each year, the threshold of the amount of violence that our weak sensibilities will tolerate is just continually lowered. That is why the guns in Tarrantino's movies keep having to get louder and louder: He is trying to get our attention and tell us that our's is a profoundly sick culture. Period! (No, exclamation mark !)

Already, our mulatto President has ""outsourced"" the investigation of Sandy Hook to his Vice President to ""study the problem,"" and we know what happens when a Presidential Commission ""studies a problem?"" Anyone who really wants to know why the ""Sandy Hooks"" keep occurring in the U.S. should just listen to the hate that drips off the mouth of that certified NRA idiot, Wayne LaPierre, or better yet, read David Courtwright's book ""Violent Lands."" Five Stars because the acting is simply superb throughout. Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson's acting is just completely off the charts!",1356566400,7,5065,4.782608695652174
5257462,3,B00947NAHU,"Tarantino has made some great homage flicks, and he has made some fairly groundbreaking ones too, but this(for me, anyway) fails on both of those counts.  His saving grace has always been his ability to write at least one really nuanced character that you either hate or love, and sometimes love to hate (Hans Landa in Inglorious Basterds and the conflicted and loveable Jules in Pulp Fiction).  But, with the marginally acceptable exception of the Dentist, played by Chirstoph Waltz, every single character in this movie is nothing more than a one-note blunder.  Don't get me wrong, all the actors bring their A game (at times overacting and chewing scenery to great effect), but they've got nothing to work with.  The ""bad"" guys are soooo BAD that you never get any of the shadowy dread that you might be rooting for an equally disturbed ""good"" guy the way you do in  Leone's flicks.  Here everything is so cut and dry that Django's greatest excesses seem wholly justified.
The bad guys have no moral misgivings, no chance is given for them to explore the nature of the evil that they are lording over their fellow human beings.  DiCaprio is really good at being scuzzy and repulsive, but his character is really dumb.  I mean REALLY dumb. ""He's a Francophile.  But don't speak French to him.  He doesn't understand it.  It embarrasses him.""  All the bad guys are so dumb that you almost don't have the heart to actually Hate them (""forgive them, they know not what they do"").  Sam Jackson's character being the only exception (I don't want to be a spoiler, so I'll leave it there) but he is in so many ways such an understandable product of this world, you actually kind of feel bad for him.
A good villain has to be aware of their evil, or they have to possess a truly compelling justification for it that absolves them, at least in their own minds (see Bill the Butcher or Hannibal Lecter).  No one in this film has that.  The phrenology scene is simply lame.  Yes, I know that phrenology was used as a justification, but not on its own.  It was a part of a larger argument, one that could have made that scene as good as the opening of Inglorious Basterds.  But instead we are just given a world full of stupid  Americans (and a few Aussies) vs Django.  It's like a 165 minute straw man argument.
The film has a lot of laughs, even more blood, and tons of awesomely gratuitous violence, some great cinematography and a really decent soundtrack.  In short; the film has brass balls, but in the end it has no heart.
Two and a half stars, really.  But I'll give the extra half for a couple of reasons that would end up being spoilers if I mentioned them.",1356480000,21,2657,4.514644351464435
5257463,4,B00947NAHU,"One thing you know for sure when you go see a Quentin Tarantino movie is that, regardless of how good or bad the movie actually is, for sure it will be entertaining.

""Django Unchained"" (2012 release; 165 min.) brings the fictitious tale, set in 1858, of Django Freeman (played by Jamie Foxx), a slave who is bought and freed by Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz). Schultz is a bounty hunter and Django can help him track down three brothers. Meanwhile we learn that Django's wife Broomhilda Von Shaft (played by Kerry Washington) is the 'property' of Calvin Candie (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), the owner of a large cotton plantation in deep Mississippi. Django and Schultz devise a plan to free Broomhilda.

Several comments: the movie is a blistering indictment of the old South in general, and slavery in particular, and in that sense makes the same points as Steven Spielberg's Lincoln movie (albeit coming at it from a very different angle) about the inherent evils of slavery. In a way one could say that these two movies are different sides of the same coin. At times ""Django Unlimited"" is wildly entertaining and outrageous (but outrageously funny), and when it works well, there is no better movie-viewing experience. Yet at the same time the movie is over-long, with stretches in the second hour of the movie that simply drag on and falter. This is as far as I can remember the first time that I have encountered this in any Qarantino movie. The theater where I saw ""Django Unchained"" on Christmas Day was absolutely packed and the audience was hollering and hooting at times, when certain scenes played out well, just fun, and you simply cannot get the same experience watching a movie like this at home. Last but not least, there are several memorable performances in the movie, one of them from none other than Don 'Miami Vice' Johnson in a small role as Big Daddy, but of course Leonardo DiCaprio's over the top performance of super-baddy Calvin Candie is unforgettable. In all, ""Django Unlimited"" is must-see for any Tarantino fan, but I feel the movie could have been even better with some tighter editing.",1356480000,4,2134,4.8119891008174385
5257464,2,B00947NAHU,"Went to see the movie this morning. Ruined my Christmas. Should've seen Les Miserable instead. Quentin Tarrantino likes to say he's a genius, but he has yet to show it in my opinion. It's like if you took the Man with no name from the Dollars trilogy and combined him with Shaft, you get Django. A somewhat dragging, overtly racist, overly gorrish B-movie that's about 40 years past it's prime. I don't see how Quentin thinks this'll win him an oscar for best pic. Spike Lee was right. Using the history of American Slavery to produce an action/spaghetti western is of poor taste. The results are even more poor. There were way too many laugh out loud moments for such a serious subject. Skip it. Maybe get it as a rental from the Redbox, unless you own a Sergio Leone movie, then you won't see anything new. Except over use of gore. Tarrantino needs to get with the times.

My grievances with the film: (Spoilers ahead)

1. The film is supposed to be set in the South yet it begins with a slave chain gang moving through an arid, rocky desert. Later, we learn this desert is supposed to be somewhere between east Texas and Mississippi, where Django was sold. I don't know of any desert between Texas and Mississippi. It's obvious Tarrantino only made this shot as that's how every spaghetti western starts, even though it's geographically and historically inaccurate.
2. Why does Dr. Schultz pay for Django after killing one of the slave traders and injuring the other, then he basically frees all the others by giving them the key to their shackles, a gun, and leaving them with the injured slave trader, who they quickly kill? It's nonsensical.
3. Why would Schultz let Django dress like a 1700's French nobleman when they go to the Tennessee Plantation? It would blow their cover immediately as the whole thing would be ludicrous. No free man would dress like that.
4. Why the comedic scene of the Klan members meeting before their attempted lynching? There's nothing funny about a bunch of racist morons arguing about attire before they try to go and lynch someone.  Lynching is not a funny subject.
5. Why does Schultz, who has no problem with killing people right in front of their loved ones, have an issue with torture and slavery? Even Django asks him this question in the movie, but he never gives an actual answer.
6. Why don't they just pay to buy Django's wife for ""the insane price of $12,000""? They concoct an elaborate plan to get her for cheap, but in the end, pay the insane amount for her. It would have saved lots of time and from the look of the amount of money Schultz had, it wasn't that much too him anyway. Who would be frugal about rescuing their wife?
7. When things go bad and Schultz kills Candie, why in the world would he, a professional killer, take the time to apologize to Django when he could've killed Candie's guard too? This would've cut the last unnecessary thirty minutes of the movie. Schultz could still die in the shootout, but why right before it begins? I know this would've cut Tarrantino's unnecessary cameo, but it could've ended the movie faster and better.  And why was the guard played by the same actor who played the slave trader who died at the beginning of the movie?
8. The actual ending was overkill. I know Tarrantino wants to rival the original Django film for violence, but blowing up the mansion? Burning it down would've been more affective and historically accurate.  Then the horse tricks Django does were just cheesy. And what's with Hilda's weird clapping? First she seems strong for a woman who's gone through all the things she has, then she's clapping like she has the mentality of a five year old at the end. Not very consistent.

I felt like Shcultz watching the dogs rip up d'Artagnan as I was watching this film. Even worse when people were laughing at it. No wonder Will Smith passed up this movie. You never really came to like/love any of the ""good"" guys, but you really came to hate DiCaprio's and especially Samuel L. Jackson's characters. What kind of movie is it where you don't really care for what happens to the protagonists, but all you care for is that the main antagonists die? That's all that I can say. Jackson stole this movie like Kevin Bacon did in Sleepers and the last Xmen movie. If this movie gets any Oscar noms, which is unlikely, the only deserved one would be Jackson's supporting acting.",1356393600,25,4388,4.6048593350383635

Lots of Tarantino grotesque characters and typical pointless violence.  Lots of grotesque scenes  Not a single white southern character who appears to possess a triple digit IQ -- they are all sadistic morons. Some good acting, in particular Samuel L. Jackson in a relatively small role, and Leonardo DiCaprio playing, get this, a sadistic southern plantation owner.

5257578,5,B00947NAHU,"When viewing this film it can be difficult to see passed Quentin Tarantinos style of directing. I do not feel drawn to this film because of its violence nor because of the racial issues that are approached pertaining to the time period. I find this film magnetizing due to its way of communicating the idea of controlled chaos.
In the plot, Christoph Waltz plays the part of a bounty hunter; however, one must eliminate the picture of Jason Bourne and modern day cinematic hitmen in order to properly picture Christoph Waltz as a bounty hunter. The way Waltz composes himself throughout the film has such a calmness that even the main character Django is confused by his mindset. Looking at it from a Christians perspective I see manners of the bounty hunter relating to the controlled chaos in ones life. I do not necessarily endorse the idea of killing someone simply because they are a bad person, but I do find Waltz reasoning simplistic and not so much appalling. In one of the scenes in the film, Waltz is training Django to shoot a man with a bounty on his head. However, Django hesitates to shoot the man because the man with the bounty on his head has his son nearby. This causes Django to question the action of killing this man. Waltz sees Djangos hesitation and then proceeds to describe how this man has murdered and robbed hundreds of people. He mentions the bounty on his head, but does not necessarily emphasize it to the extreme. This causes me to wonder whether Waltz character is doing this for money or perhaps striving to eliminate the evil in the world single handed. Keeping this in thought I then analyzed how Waltz character is calm throughout the entire film, even in the most dangerous of situations. He conducts conversations with villains in such a manner that makes him seem a gentleman held at the highest standard even though he then proceeds to encourage slaves to blow a mans head off with a double barrel shot gun.
Based on these observations I see this character representing the controlled chaos that illustrates calmness while at the same time encouraging chaos. I do not relate to this character, but I relate to Django. Django is a man rescued from chaos and taught how to properly seek revenge. I do not endorse the teachings of Waltz, but I instead reevaluate my associations because Waltz character seems familiar and can be hypothetically compared to the people that influence our lives from day to day. This proceeds to place caution in my mindset and causes me to be aware of those I associate with.",1512432000,,2545,4.6957494407158835

The acting is superb - Christopher Waltz picked up an Oscar for Best supporting actor and QT took home an Oscar for best original screenplay. Somehow Jamie Fox was robbed because he is at the center of this magnificent movie.

Yes, this is a partial western, although the majority of the movie is set in Tennessee. I have never been a big DiCaprio fan but I think these hes getting better, with age.

This is what movies aim for, and what great directors, actors, writers, etc., can produce.

One final word - if you're queasy about hearing the so-called n-word (NOT an euphemism that we use in MY neighborhood!) then youd best stay away. And if Tarintinos penchant for exaggerated blood-flowing isn't your thing, youve no need to ever watch a QT film.

5257667,5,B00947NAHU,"Released in 2012 and directed & written by Quentin Tarantino, Django Unchained stars Christoph Waltz as an ex-dentist who befriends an ex-slave, Django (Jamie Foxx) in West Texas a couple of years before the Civil War; they team-up as bounty hunters once they realize how good they jell. The second half focuses on their attempt to infiltrate a Mississippi plantation owned by pompous Southerner Monsieur Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) in order to rescue Djangos wife (Kerry Washington). Samuel L. Jackson plays Candies overly loyal house slave.

This is an excellent American Western with Spaghetti Western elements featuring Tarantinos typical artistic flourishes. It takes place in the West AND in the South, which is reminiscent of the underrated Nevada Smith (1966), one of my favorite Westerns. Waltz is magnetic as the nonchalant protagonist and he & Foxx have good chemistry. Theres a nice mix of interesting dialogues, amusing moments and over-the-top action. Unfortunately, but to be expected, Tarantino goes overboard with the n word and the blood-letting, the latter to the point of cartoonish-ness.

Nevertheless, this is an original Western that is vibrant with creativity, including stunning locations, cinematography and a great amalgamated soundtrack/score, which includes cuts by Ennio Morricone, like the excellent Hornets Nest, the imaginative ""The Braying Mule"" and the moving Ancora Qui. Unlike the one-dimensional, intentionally offensive and absurdly overdone The Hateful Eight (2015), Django Unchained is an all-around great modern Western.

The movie run 165 minutes and was shot in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Evergreen Plantation & New Orleans, Louisiana; and several locations in California (Lone Pine, Alabama Hills, Semi Valley, Melody Ranch, Santa Clarita, Independence & Los Angeles). The cast includes numerous peripheral notables, e.g. Ato Essandohs, Don Stroud, James Remar, Bruce Dern, Ato Essandoh, Franco Nero, Don Johnson, Amber Tamblyn and several others.

5257670,4,B00947NAHU,"I make no bones that I like Quentin Tarantino. I admire the vision he has for this movies, I admire his dedication to the craft and I admire the actors that he hires for the roles. Yes he uses and reuses certain actors but he's not the only one to do this.

To call Tarantino a hack is to misunderstand where he's coming from. Yes he borrows heavily from other movies and genres but he makes those things his own. It's one thing to steal. It's a completely different thing to steal, have people know that you've done it and still be impressed with what you did.

This movie deals with a freed slave by the name of Django who's hired by a bounty hunter to find the Brickle Brothers. Pretty straight forward. Christoph Waltz is brilliant as the dentist turned bounty hunter that frees Django. Jamie Foxx is of course very good in the role of the freed slave who's a natural with a gun. Samuel L Jackson is wonderful as the scheming and downright evil house slave Steven. And of course Leonardo DiCaprio shines as Monsieur Candie the harsh slave owner who happens to own Django's wife. He deserved an oscar for this role and if you've ever seen the dinner scene you'll understand why.

Like most Tarantino movies this one had it's fair share of cursing, liberal use of the N-word which was common for the time and a whole lot of blood. It's not comical and over the top like in Kill Bill but it does paint the countryside at some point.

The only part that felt strange was Tarantino's cameo in this one as an Aussie. His accent was a little strange and overdone but he's just a minor character so it's easily overlooked.",1498608000,2,1618,4.40133779264214

The story is less interesting but slightly less predictable with a poor entertainment to violence ratio. From reading the other reviews, I guess I should have known about the generous use of graphic violence given the tendencies of the director Quentin Tarantino. I thought this was not really a Western as much as it was a story about a cruel plantation owner. Maybe I missed a shootout at the OK corral at the end.",1496188800,,512,4.688888888888889

5257680,2,B00947NAHU,"Tarantino couldn't figure out what kind of a movie he wanted to make, and wasted almost three hours of my time trying to figure it out. This did not run the gamut from brutal to hilarious. It ran the gamut from boring to depressing.",1496016000,,232,4.295454545454546
5257681,5,B00947NAHU,"I am enamored with this movie. Crude, violent, terrific acting (I just love each scene that features the irreplaceable Dr. King Schultz) and it comes with a brilliantly composed soundtrack to boot. The plot is well-known so there is no need to repeat. A lot of people criticize the movie because it features such an abysmally poor image of caucasian people that causes the hardened Dr. King to suffer from white guilt.

I think for a Tarantino film, that doesn't distract from the crude revenge theme of the plot and at any rate, 12 years a slave is a lot more harsh including rape scenes that never appear in the book. Samuel L Jackson and Leonardo Di Caprio play convincing and terrifying villains. Candy's sister's demise is beyond ridiculous (who flys sideways after being shot at long range with a regular gun?), but the finale is satisfying.

If there is only real fault I have with this film, it's that the last third is long and slow. The movie shines the most in its first half and sort of lags during the scenes where the duo of oddball bountry hunters visit Candyland. For that reason alone, I'd award the film 4 1/2 stars.

One last tidbit, the Latin American spanish dub is amazing and I genuinely prefer to listen to the dub over the original english version. Dr King's heavy german accent is sadly absent in the original english version.",1495929600,,1352,4.625

This movie's setting was 2 years before the civil war, so the basis of slavery and the 'n' word is quite prevalent.

5257692,5,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained (2012) is a film that pays homage to the great spaghetti westerns, particularly Django from 1966. In typical Tarantino fashion, this film is one depicting violence, shock value, and an addictive soundtrack. The music in this film is modern-day, which strangely enhances the film's deliverance of plot and entertainment value. Tarantino knows how to make films that challenge the audience and the industry as a whole, and this film can really take a viewer aback with its racial slurs, etc. Tarantino boldly takes the viewer inside the world of pre-Civil War America, and holds nothing back. The settings are excellent, with vast scenery and believable town scenarios. Jamie Foxx was believable as the lead character, and the supporting cast was up to the task. Overall, Django Unchained is a pretty quirky film that is clever in its script, and bold in every way imaginable. And don't forget the awesome music which really makes this film stand out. The special features for this blu ray are excellent and will entertain.",1493337600,3,1038,5.076023391812866

Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed this movie (thus it has some similarities to his other films), it is definitely not as quirky or raw as many of his films. The violence in this movie ranges from silly to.... sadly, horrifically realistic (though you don't ""see"" the worst parts).

It is a Western movie, though a good portion of it takes place a bit to the east. Foxx and Waltz are incredible in this movie. Great cinematography, great music selection, wonderful American landscape scenery from the deep south to Texas to the Rockies... if you are ""old school"" (but not too prudish) and do not like Tarantino's other stuff, give this a try.

5257788,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino is one of the most unique and interesting writer/directors in all of Hollywood, a man who's style and wit seem to transcend time and history, but would he be able to apply this talent to slavery and the wild west, I had my doubts. Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is not your typical bounty hunter, as he has a very unique and unorthodox way of getting his job done. Schultz thinks the best way to shock people is to free a slave, make him his partner, and let him ride into town and stay with him wherever he goes, which usually leads to shock, outrage, and more N words than your typical Jay-Z album. Eventually the successful duo goes in search of Django's wife, who is being held at the plantation of a truly evil man, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). In order to get her back, the two attempt to con the southern ""gentleman"", but will everything go as planned? This film is vintage Tarantino, filled with the unique characters you won't find anywhere else, ridiculous cameos you'd never expect, tremendous back and fourth dialogues, and of course the unexpected. as everything and anything will happen. Every actor under Tarantino's direction has a way of stepping up their game in his films, but Christoph Waltz was truly spectacular. There is a good reason he won the 2012 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, as somehow he manages to give an even stronger performance than he did in Inglorious Bastards. I really can't say enough about Tarantino, and out of all his films, this was the one I was the least excited about, but as it turns out, Django may actually be one of the best films he's ever done, and it is now the newest entry on our list of must see movies!",1480291200,,1699,4.573770491803279

I'm also a cowboy-boot-wearing-country boy from east Texas with an accent who loves country music and who even owns his own six shooter. I've watched westerns my entire life. I used to watch them a lot with my grandmother (she loved John Wayne). I've watched everything from John Wayne and Clint Eastwood westerns and many modern westerns, including those with Tom Selleck. Truthfully, I'm a bit of a western junkie. Even though I'll always love The Duke, Clint, and Magnum, this western, in my humble-good 'ole-boy opinion, is simply the best western every made......EVER!!

Jamie Foxx is brilliant, the story is enthralling, the dialogue is captivating, the action and shooting scenes were brilliantly done!!! I mean wow....all I can say is wow. It is a long movie, but it goes quickly. I hope you enjoy every minute of it. I know I did!!

Django is one of his best movies.  and Jamie foxx, and Christoph waltz were just perfect for their lead roles.  Tarantino brings out the best in the actors, always.  cant say enough good things about the movie or the writting or directing.  everyone involved in the movie did a great job.

5257850,4,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained
 Django Unchained is billed as a Western but that isn't quite right.  Christopher Waltz, in his character as dentist turned murderous bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz notes that Django, Jamie Fox, might be called The fastest gun in the South.  Since most of the action takes place in the South, it is hard to call it a Western.  It is a kidnapping/vengeance flick like the recent Taken but that isn't quite right either.  Often with writer/director Quinton Tarantino it is hard to put his work into a neat category.
 It is rated R for massive violence.  As my French movie friend said You get really a lot of blood with Tarantino.  Too right she is.  The shock effect does wear off quickly and then becomes redundant and pointless after the first few gallons are sloshed around.  The scene of the final shoot-out looks like something from Texas Chainsaw Massacre (which was number one this weekend-go figure.)  The epic blood fest is very entertaining, I will say that.
 And the acting truly well done.  Leonardo DiCaprio continues his career path of innovative roles.  He plays plantation owner Calvin Candie as a man of his time, place and station-and with the very subtle indication that he is aware of his educational shortcomings. He makes up his intellectual shortcomings by an over reliance on Uncle Steven, his butler, played with bombastic malevolence by Samuel L. Jackson.  Jamie Fox is Django, the title character who learns the bounty hunter trade from Waltz.  Don Johnson and Walton Goggins, and Tarantino himself also appear in small roles.  The characterizations are both well written by Tarantino and well directed by Tarantino, bringing out just what he wanted in his cast of excellent professionals.
 Kerry Washington plays the captive wife of Django, Broomhilda with just the right touch of pathos and courage.
 But what is this two hour and 45 minute movie that the producers lavished a hundred million dollars on the making thereof?  It only makes sense to me as a legend, a retelling of the Germanic legend of Siegfried and Broomhilda.  In the original, which is full of horrible, dark skulduggery, Siegfried must rescue his lady from a dragon (DiCapio) and go through fire (exemplified by the dozens of fire arms bearing henchmen that Django must go through.)  That makes it work for me.  Otherwise the jarring anomalies will ruin the ride.  For example-we have comic actor Jonah Hill appearing as a KKK night-rider a decade before the KKK was founded.  We also have weapons in the hands of killers that are 20 years before their time.  This might be excusable in something light like Abraham Lincoln-Vampire Hunter but not in a Tarantino film.  But if it is a legend, the time goofs just don't matter.  It is all fantasy.
 But the un-necessary buckets of blood restrict this entertaining legend to an average three saw blades.  It has brought in $106 million in two weeks so it should turn a profit.",1470787200,,2938,4.853118712273642

Plus, the violent shotgun bloodbaths are so comical and cartoonish I actually began giggling.  The acting and writing was first rate, with over the top performances by DiCaprio and Jackson and effective, understated efforts by both Foxx and Waltz.

However, Tarantino's obsession with making ""Tarantino Movies"" rather than shooting for unbridled excellence is mystifying. Too bad, because there are great moments in this film.  The ultimate 3 star movie.",1470614400,,682,5.592233009708738

5257872,4,B00947NAHU,"The part of this movie that deals with Candyland is more or less successful. Di Caprio is excellent as Mr. Candie, Foxx excels as Django, and Christopher Walz is good as bounty hunter King Schultz. Walz won an Oscar, though I found his acting to be a little too precious--as if he was hoping for another Oscar. He was right; it worked.

What precedes the Candyland episode and what follows it is boring. I feel like Tarantino took a very good grade-B pulp fiction story and conflated it into a 2 and half hour drag. In Pulp Fiction, he kept the action and dialogue moving, and only briefly touched on deeper moral issues. In Django Unchained, he wants to combine grindhouse bloodsport with lofty commentary about the national sin of slavery. He himself appears as a slaver to acknowledge that, like Mr. Candie, he too is using black slaves for his own sport and profit--as a Hollywood film maker.

As you might expect, Tarantino can't have it both ways. You end up groaning through the weaker parts while all the time wishing that the enjoyable parts were better. That's not much of a compliment but that's the best I can muster.

The DVD looks very good on a widescreen 32-inch panel. Robert Richardson's cinematography is immaculate, so much so that I wonder how he got snubbed for an Oscar whereas Tarantino won an Oscar for Best Screenplay. It all looks great but looks only go so far.",1468454400,,1389,4.615384615384615

5257946,5,B00947NAHU,"Tarantino is his element with this singular film. Carefully thought with his personal vision of the Western genre. And like the great masters of the genre (Anthony ;Mann) he displays the whole range of factors around what was goin' on in Texas 1858 when the term ""New World"" (coined by Antonin Dvorak decades later with his well known Symphony) makes a German headhunter shakes hands with a slave in order to make a gentleman's agreement in which both will have profitable benefits.

What I really liked the most resides in the febrile imagination of Tarantino to tie Brunhilda (the wife of Foxx) to impress the picture of an epic noblesse, beat and triumph beyond all the possible hindrances and obstacles. Of course, there's acidic humor along the journey takes place. Christopher Waltz shines with radiant spectre, as well as Foxx and Samuel Jackson as the loyal servant (a sort of the devilish Yago).

Rivers of blood but underlined by a solid script make of this film a recent classic of the genre, so simple like that. So what are you waiting for? Give yourself a try with this movie.",1458518400,,1090,4.761904761904762

You don't have to be a Quentin Tarantino fan to love this movie. What is not to love about this movie? It's an American western fantasy with a very good  ""oh no!"" and ""BOOYA!!! all mixed up.

Don Johnson dressed in a white Versace suit plays Sonny Crockett on a southern plantation named CANDYLAND.  Patiently waited for someone to be strapped to a chair and tortured, while K-Billy's super sounds OF THE 70's (1870's) played in the background.

Leonardo DiCaprio has great fun playing a descipably sadistic plantation owner villain who is a Francophile, into all things French, but can't speak a lick of the language, making for another funny moment in the movie.

He did not disappoint.  Just all around horrible. The plot was ok, but the acting and dialogue were terrible despite the A-list cast (with the exception of Leonardo). Everything about the movie seems forced.  Definitely would not recommend.

Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were great movies.  The dialogue and the acting were top notch, with the violence being simultaneously prominent and secondary.  I guess Quentin Tarantino is no longer capable of writing slick, smart movies, so instead he writes controversial stuff with over the top violence.",1453075200,,709,5.238938053097345

As much as it's entertaining, the film's lack of sincerity and ultimate inability to take itself seriously are frustrating and distracting. All of the gimmicks--the giant title cards, the anachronistic music, Tarantino's insertion of himself into the film and his character's death in an inexplicably large explosion, the ridiculously out-of-control ending--are just annoying. Tarantino may think he's being bold, daring, clever, creative, new wave, or avant-garde here, but these desperate cries for attention are like the cinematic experiments of a 12-year-old. They threw me out of the story and made it difficult to care about what happened next.

The story and characters are compelling, but the film would have been so much better if it were more sincere.",1452556800,,940,5.566433566433567

5258000,5,B00947NAHU,"You always know what to expect from Tarantino  a superb soundtrack, plenty of action, witty dialogue and, of course, a lot of graphic violence. This movie is no exception.  We are great Tarantino fans but for some reason we never got around to buying Django Unchained, having been put off by the early very mixed review scores but thankfully it was recently aired on UK television. We will now definitely be adding the Blu-ray to our collection.

Like every other Tarantino film, even Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained is incredibly well observed and founded upon a deep understanding of and familiarity with the genre. He, like many of us, plainly grew up on a diet of Westerns and every genre tick-box is neatly checked but it is definitely an homage rather than a derivative pastiche. It is actually a tribute to a 1966 Italian film Django by Sergio Corbucci whose star (Franco Nero) has a cameo appearance and the two films share the same theme song. (Thanks, Wiki, for that bit of info). Hitchcock style, Tarantino also puts in his usual appearance.

[Very minor spoiler alert] Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a bounty hunter posing as a dentist rescues Django (Jamie Foxx) from slavers as he can recognise Schultzs current objective. It is soon evident that Django has a talent for the work and Schultz agrees to train him and to help in his search for his wife.

That is the nub of the plot and, like every other Western, it is pretty simple but the principle casts performance, the dialogue, pace, soundtrack and the incredible cinematography make this one of Tarantinos most coherent and accessible films to date. There are some superb set pieces, the top of the heap being the masked lynch mob / KKK parody  simply superb and worth watching the film just for that. The film was justifiably nominated for a number of awards and is Tarantinos most critically acclaimed and commercially successful film to date. Absolutely superb.",1452384000,,1940,4.863636363636363

5258021,4,B00947NAHU,"A movie that examines the human condition through the bloody lens of over-the-top Tarantino bloodbaths like ""Kill Bill,"" you might find yourself saying ""that would never happen"" more than once during this film. I make it my policy to not give up spoilers, so you'll just have to find those spots in the movie yourself.

I'd say that ""most mesmerizing performance"" honors are a toss-up between Christoph Waltz as ""Dr. King Schultz"" and Leonardo DiCaprio as Plantation / Slave owner ""Calvin Candie."" DiCaprio seems to have really absorbed the essence of Jack Nicholson's 2006 performance as ""Frank Costello"" in the 2006 Martin Scorsese film ""The Departed,"" in which DiCaprio also starred. Like Costello, Candie's evil is a sport...he relishes it, he rolls around in it and cannot be separated from its fulfillment. It's probably not a stretch to call at least a few of DiCaprio's character's outbursts ""Nicholsonian."" And the casting genius of the role is that they didn't offer it to Nicholson, or any actor like him...they handed it to Leo and let him take it over the top.

It's a L-O-N-G movie...not sure if I agree with some of the ""boring"" assessments...and like pretty much every other Tarantino, it places equal weight on the moral ambiguities experienced by the good guys AND the bad guys. The ""good"" guys are never totally good, while the ""bad"" guys are never totally ""bad."" How can I say that? Well, Samuel L. Jackson plays something of a ""Renfield"" role to DiCaprio's bloodsucker. Jackson's a bad guy, no doubt about it, but his character is an African American who enjoys slipping into a big plush chair in DiCaprio's study and savoring a brandy while he tells his ""master"" that he's kidding himself. DiCaprio indulges Jackson because he knows Jackson is a sneak, a toad, an informant, the one guy on the entire plantation who knows that rewards come with watching his ""master's"" back. None of the relationships or character studies are simple or one-dimensional, neither are they completely believable, which is where ""entertainment"" comes in.

Worth a purchase? I'd start with a rental first, because if you are a fan of Tarantino's films, and anything I wrote here captured your interest or curiosity, you will probably like it...you just may not watch it over and over again.",1450569600,,2290,4.958333333333333

5258033,5,B00947NAHU,"What the what was I thinking? I love Tarantino, and I have no idea why I never saw this when it came out. Maybe I was freaked out by what I anticipated would be gruesome whipping of slaves. Hey, I don't mind gore and cartoony violence but when it gets a little too Hellraiser, I'm out.

Well, the movie is nothing like that at all. It's more the typical Sam Peckinpaugh ripoff violent action Tarantino loves to ape. Anyway, this is a fantastic story filled with great characters depicting what you or I would think the Deep South was all about during the heyday of slavery. I thought the dynamic between the two bounty hunters (played by Christoph Walz and Jamie Foxx) was perfect. I could have used a little more Kerry Washington in this and maybe a tad less Leonardo Di Caprio, but can't really complain.

Sonny Crockett is excellent as the first cruel slave owner we meet and there's a short Jonah Hill sighting in a scene with Don Johnson.

There is the typical snappy retorts and sharp dialogue Tarantino flicks are noted for as well as the ubiquitous cameo by the man himself. Honestly, I think the guy needs to dial that back to silent Hitchcock ""blink and you might miss him"" cameos. Just a thought.

The cinematopgraphy is beyond excellent as it truly framed the wilds of the West as well as the swampy stickiness and weeping willow beauty and horror of the plantation South. Cutting through the Tarantino-ness, it's one of the better celluloid looks at this dark past in America's history.",1448841600,,1499,4.602996254681648

A little way into the movie when I saw gallons of fake blood I realized, which I did not know going in, that this piece of crap was by Quentin Tarantino. I cannot imagine how a lot of A-list and a B list actors got roped into this mess. I can see why Will Smith wouldn't touch this and turned down the part of Django. I could retire on the amount of money spent on fake blood in Tarantino's garbage fests.

Even with that I found it hard to wrap my head around the fact that these two have ""looked the other way"" at all sorts of hideous treatment of people, befriended all types to get the people their hunting (they're bounty hunters). And they always survived. But the guy who trains Django throws his life away because he won't shake hands with someone and shoots him in a no win situation where he know he'll be killed.

But this movie here I have to say was very intresting and enjoyable.  For a movie being 2 hours and roughly 45 minutes I savor every minute of it the whole way threw.  I also have to admit Jamie Foxx gave a very good preformance of the main character Django, and Leo gave an amazing preformance as the villan, and most of us love a good villan in a movie if it's done right.  The movie as a whole I give a 4 star rating because some scenes distracted from the main storyline of a man trying to find and save his wife.  Although the whole cast gave very good preformances and I wouldn't expect anything less from the actors and director's choice of people he enjoy's working with to make a film, looking forward to seeing what he makes as his next films.  In closing if you like a film with a mixture of action, adventure, and drama with western elements thrown in here there then buy this movie and enjoy some great acting from some talented actors and an amazing director.",1442620800,2,1109,4.3076923076923075

5258091,3,B00947NAHU,"The GOOD..What amazing and wonderful acting performances from Christoper Walz. Dicaprio, AND Sam Jackson (his finest acting role).

The BAD--Tarantino goes for the ""commercial"" sales aspects and incorpprates (BADLY) modern ""Hip Hop"" ""rap"" and even Jim Croce music into a film set in 1858. He painstakingly goes to the trouble or trying to portray the time period accurately...yet he uses music made in 2015 as his soundtrack. Makes NO sense, seems a cheap exploit to sell a soundtrack. What music SHOULD have been used. Period music--Gospel, Blues, Spirituals of the South. The COEN Brothers make sure they are accurate when they do a movie soundtrack (OH BROTHER for example) It also makes little sense that Sam Jacksons character is so eager to rat out Django to Candie. Why not exploit this to his OWN ends and make a considerable profit. Instead he is loyal to his former Slave master in a way that is so off that it makes Stephen out to be an insane and confused character MISGUIDED and DELUSIONAL that CANDIE will return the favor. Candie never t to offer Stephen anything for his betrayal of Django...sicne he is killed..but even if he were not shot---does anyone beleive Candie was going to reward Stephen adequately?  I assume this wwas written by DESIGN to show just how damaged a psyche is STEPHEN but in reality...one wonders why Stephen still LOVES  Candie so. There is no scene, no background gien to show WHY Stephen is so in love with Candie.

THE UGLY--The last 45 minutes of this film. He destroys what he created in a number of ways. The Violent finales are all shot in some sort of Orange hued or imperfect color scheme. Blood is not the right color (Yes it is defintely tinted orange). His EGO--He puts himself in the film in a POOR acting performance with a terrible Australian accent. Now this would not be so bad except it clashes with he incredible performances of the other actors. He does his own cast a HUGE disservice by his placing himself in arole that could eaily have been given to  Russell Crowe ,Hugh Jackman or any GOOD actor. He almost ruins the film.  Yes.the GOOD of the film outweighs the bad..and the first 2 hours are  so well done, clever, and emotionally engaging it can be viewed as favorite over and over...but this last 45 minutes is just too silly, poorly acted, hastily written and all in all not a satisfying conclusion.

WHat could have been a masterpiece of film making turns cheap in the last hour and even cheaper by Tarantion;s bad acting. A shame since these actors give such deep perfect performances.",1442448000,2,2558,4.719730941704036

When this first came out, it had a lot of hype, which I didn't buy into after I saw the previews. Others were amused when my explanation for not watching the movie was, ""A movie about killing white people makes me nervous."" Now that I've seen it, I see that's not completely accurate based on Django's interaction with Jackson's character and Waltz's character. He has clear affection for Waltz's character at the end, while harboring disdain for Jackson's.

A movie that makes a hero/protagonist that celebrates the African American people has been long overdue, and in that regard, Tarentino, my hat is off to you. Loved the scene at the end where Fox and Washington had the throwback silhouette embrace, and Fox owned that bareback ride to the plantation like a boss.

The moment the movie jumped the shark for me was when Django's character lets a slave be eaten by dogs. Based off of Fox's interpretation of the character that far into the movie, it didn't really fit. After that, I couldn't see a clear moral distinction between Jackson's character or Fox's, and Jackson's death at the end wasn't justified.

This was my technical first Tarentino film viewing full-length, I had seen Inglorious Basterds in parts flipping back and forth on TV. I will not be joining the Enlightened Ones who celebrate the gore of these films. Tarentino is unapologetic, and so am I.",1441584000,,1452,4.753968253968254

5258117,2,B00947NAHU,"Imagine a bad rap song and a good western were combined. Throw in a shock seriel killer movie. That's Django Unchained.

The Plot
Django, a former slave, is taken under the wing of a bounty hunter. Together they make money violently (albeit legally) killing alleged criminals. Their greater mission is to rescue Django's wife, still held as a slave. In short, it is a vengeance with a noble cause movie. The hero, overall, is not a better man than the antagonists.

The plot's not hard to understand and the overall outcome is completely predictable. What was unexpected is the gratuitous (and copious) amounts of blood splattering with every shot, the cartoonish characters, and the unbelievable transition Django has when going from slave to free. The writers threw in whenever possible the n-word, the F-word, and enough ""Jesus Christs"" to embarrass even a backslidden agnostic.

Interesting but not entirely plausible are the character names, like Django, D'Artagnan, and Broomhilda. Explanations are given but I just nodded my head.

For all my criticism, Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz did an excellent job. Leonardo DiCaprio, who is normally fantastic, overacted in the midst of trying to underplay his role.

In short, if you like bloody movies with a vengeance twist and a little blacksploitation circa mid-1980s, you might like it. It is, in the end, mindless. If you get up for popcorn midway, no problem.

I wish Quentin would get over this retro 70's pulp kick. Most of his audience were born 20 years later, so have no idea that there is a level of ironic tribute to this type of film.

This is the first Tarantino that I felt just had no substance at all. What is the difference between this and a D grade action film except for production value that he get from a budget afforded to him on reputation? I watched this more or less back to back with Inglourious Basterds, which is the far superior film, where the silliness has more of an element of fun.

I was musing how great Jackie Brown was and wondering when he was going to make another film with that level of subtlety. Then I tought, you know what, he is probably no longer capable of that....",1437609600,2,881,4.176470588235294

5258188,5,B00947NAHU,"It has been a long time since I have seen an excellent western come from the Hollywood blockbuster movie machine. Most of the time, westerns have lived in the action adventure category. They generally treat the western film as a spectacle made up of a series of shootouts. The characterizations have just enough flesh to them to tell the viewer who he should root for. Note that this isn't bad. I love those types of westerns. The Quick and the Dead of 1995 (despite reviews), was a fun movie. However, it was not a great western.

This movie is a great western. It has that same feeling of individualism and the desire to live up to your own sense of right and wrong that all great westerns have. The movie follows the story of Django, a black slave who is bought and freed by a German bounty hunter in return for some information on several criminals. The story continues with his learning to shoot (being a natural gunslinger), hunting bounties with his companion, and eventually searching for and freeing the woman he loves. Every step of the way, we see that Django has taken to heart his new found freedom and desire to act toward his purpose. We see his disdain for slavery, and his willingness to tolerate despicable actions for the one he loves. He meets well designed characters who all have their own motivations like the weak willed and easily manipulated plantation owner (played expertly by DiCaprio), and the house slave (Samuel L. Jackson) who seeks to be the man on top, even if it is only on top of the slaves. I could go further, but then I would be spoiling.

As this is a Tarantino movie, there are plenty of stylistic shots and action shooting. Expect excessive blood and a lack of realism when it comes to shootouts. To that I immediately think back to the woman who was shot and went flying twenty feet the wrong way. There are also some stylistic anachronisms that are present (language is obvious, though forgivable). The only nitpicks I would really bring up were some weapons I noticed the two protagonists using that were either largely unavailable at the time (repeater rifles) or not yet invented (TNT and Dynamite). Note that this nitpicking is extremely minor and completely overshadowed by the things they did got right. For example, the almost exclusive use of black powder pistols during all major gun fights. Of course it is just a movie, and a Tarantino movie, so realism is not to be expected. It was however, enjoyed where it was present.

This is an excellent movie and a great western. If you like movies like One upon a Time in the West, Unforgiven, or A Fist Full of Dollars, then give this one a try. It is definitely worth the rental fee.",1432598400,12,2684,4.599164926931106
5258189,5,B00947NAHU,Best movie hands down in a long time and of all time for Tarantino. Jamie Fox played the part of a lifetime in this film and the rest of the cast was awesome. Just the whole idea of a black bounty hunter back then is priceless. I can watch this any time and never lose interest in it. Also any fans of this character watch the end of (million ways to die in the west) and it is Jamie fox as Django that shoots the white operator of the runaway slave machine.,1432339200,,458,3.989130434782609

I am the last person to be offended normally, especially with comedy.  But I am embarrassed to find out this over-the-top language is at worst completely acceptable, and at best rewarded.  One scene of it would have been a comedic social commentary classic.  The whole movie of it quickly becomes disrespectful, as it settles into just being pathetic.

Script failure I call it.-- why raise your have up in celebration when there is another man in the room with a gun pointed at you. He knew Django did not have another gun on him.  Hated to see him killed.

5258239,2,B00947NAHU,"I couldn't tell if I was supposed to laugh or cry at this abomination in which blood bags are a-popp'n. Viewing Django Unchained is like going for a roll in a gutter full of blood and guts. I suppose some people will find it very cathartic. It seems we have become a nation of blood thirsty trolls, intent upon paddling our fingers in the burnt entrails of our enemies and have an insatiable desire to set up straw men and knock them over. This reminds me much of the propaganda film in 1984 where an aircraft stoops upon a boat full of enemy refugees and blows them to pieces, and the audience cheers. Is that what we have become?

The cinematography is excellent, the music is often great, the particular scene where the caravan enters Candie Land is worth watching many times. The characters and story seem torn from the pages of a comic book and are as shallow. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is masterful, Leonardo DiCaprio is very good, but they both had believable characters to play; Christoph Waltz is hamstrung by less believable character while Jamie Foxx does a mediocre job with an unbelievable character. The movie is such a hodgepodge of chauvinistic images and comic bows to other film genra that it makes no sense, I am not sure what I have watched. The bloodbath that turns the Candie Land mansion into a charnal house, brings to mind the act of the Odyssey where Odysseus returns to his home only to find a swarm of vermin like suitors eating up his wealth and courting his beautiful and faithful wife Penelope. Odysseus, with a bit of help, slays them all in a bloody fit of murder.

It's definitely his style, without being too weird or predictable. I also love the dramatic overtones that are typical of old Spaghetti Westerns, down to a big piece of the musical score. My boyfriend, who makes me (begrudgingly) watch old Westerns repeatedly,  such as The Good, The Bad and and The Ugly and Fistful of Dollars, went from completely ignoring the movie to being completely glued to the plot within the first few minutes, after he made the connection.

The main acting was great, the plot was fast moving, and I never felt bored. I'm only disappointed that I put off watching it for long.  If you don't like gory effects and take offense to foul language  (as with most Tarantino films, which I love), then you may want to skip;  however,  being part-black/multiracial myself, I didn't find the overuse of the N-word offensive--that's how it was back then.

""The 'D' is silent"" might be the best bit of dialogue in any of his films. Django is funny and thoroughly entertaining and improved my mood greatly. Jamie Foxx is tremendous, with Waltz as the German-Jewish 'dentist' is his perfect foil. Don Johnson as ""Big Daddy"" and DeCaprio as ""Monsieur Candy"" are both obviously having a fine time and are not wasted as so many celeb cameos are.

Before the outbreak of the American Civil War, slave Django (Jamie Foxx) meets dentist/bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). Schultz frees Django and agrees to help him rescue his wife (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of seedy plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his sly house slave (Samuel L. Jackson). Also, racism.

What did I think?

Q-ball has done well everything he usually does well, and done poorly some things he usually does well, too. The humour and pacing is there  for the first half . Then Django transitions into territory that is dangerously close to being an outright two-dimensional mute.

Ill skirt past the elephant in the room  the debate over whether Tarantinos use of slavery and racism in pre-Civil War America amounts to anything meaningful or is just thinly veiled exploitation  because otherwise well be here all day. Essentially, its the second one. And its violent as hell.

That said, Waltz, Foxx and DiCaprio are excellent and Tarantino has delivered a fitting tribute to the Westerns of old, soaked in irony and a genuine respect for the genre. Its glorious, but no Inglourious.",1423699200,,1163,5.08421052631579

The crimes of white America against black history and the American Indian people are not forgivable. White America is on the same page as the Nazi holocaust.

This movie is SO great in so many ways. It is morally satisfying. It reminds us what a disgusting excuse for humanity white America was... and still is. It reminds me of the greatness of black history. So this movie, like Inglorious Bastards, attempts to connect with real nazi-hating anti-racists... like me. Oh it worked. Plus, the movie is a gift to western lovers. Everything from the titles, to the music and songs are western-lovers catnip. I was an innocent Minnesota boy who ended up in Greenville Mississippi in the early 60s, whilst that old time hate was still in full force. I have been drawn to the history of the south and the west... all of my life. Greenville was an explosive experience for me. Tarantino is such a master. The cast of the movie is great. It took over my consciousness for a long time. Favorite line from Christoph Walz: ""I'm bored"" ...he connected with DiCaprio the plantation owner by saying just the right thing to increase his credibility. The south considered black people to be personal property much like a chicken. Nobody gonna tell you what to do with your chicken.

Although the film does bring to light an awareness of how dehumanizing slavery and the slave trade is, you can see he's focused on making a film in the same vein as the Kung Fu and spaghetti western movies of the 70s and he does a nice job of it.

5258356,2,B00947NAHU,"Tarantino likes to do three things: find new graphic ways to kill people, turn his characters into stereotypes, and indulge himself in every type of revenge he can muster up. He is all about form over content, and, even more important, he has no moral compass. One can live without the compass in a mindless action movie. But when you are making what you consider to be a piece of art, especially with a subject like slaveryor in Inglorious Bastards, WWII and the ensuing attempt of Genocideyou raise the stakes, and form isn't enough, and some moral statement is essential. To wit: in Pulp Fiction, a young male character is shot in the face by accident by John Travolta's character. Both he and Samuel Jackson's characters are portrayed as hip, somewhat caring individuals, even though they are hit men. But in this scene, the shooting is played for laughs and ultimately, just a setup for the ""cleaner"" to be brought in to clean up the mess before Tarantino's character's wife gets home. Message? The death of an innocent victim has no value except for its comic possibilities. No moral compass. In Inglorious Bastards, all German soldiers are treated as devils and are to be ground up like so much worthless meat. And in Django, slavery is just a backdrop for Tarantino to condemn all southerners, create an absurd character (Django) to carry out his revenge, as if fantasy could somehow right the wrongs of history. His vision is a limited one, and while I'll grant that he has certain skills as a director, he is basically a one trick pony enamored by his own bloody self indulgence.",1421625600,,1589,4.740072202166065

I should have known it was a Quenton Terentino  movie and his very extreme violent killing scenes except for a couple of clever and timed clever scenes, all the others are so numerous and so exaggerated as to be downright childish and silly!!  Too bad for someone so creative and talented as Mr. Terentino that he does not allow anyone to try and reign him in and pull him back.

That being said from an old woman's perspectives and as a Hypnotist, These kinds of violent  movies and TV shows have saturated the young minds into being programmed to go gun down other people. What you focus on and get mesmerized by is what you are are mostly likely to do or attract into your own life's reality. It is sad that so many young people are like sacrificial lambs to the slaughter that are being conditioned  and  desensitized pain and suffering and inflicting it on others without understanding or caring.

Even so, I found myself more than a bit disturbed by more than one of this movie's outrageously violent scenes. What picks this movie up and makes it incredible is the great performance by Jamie Foxx (who is always reliable), and the downright legendary showing by Cristoferson. His acting in this movie is damn near transcendent (and I don't think I've ever described a performance with that word), which makes it a strange contrast to the overall hokiness that pervades.

5258389,2,B00947NAHU,"Makes the catastrophic mistake of not ending exactly where it should. If it didn't tack on all those minutes of totally stupid and not-so-well-done scenes of, you know, mindless carnage...This would have totally been slick.

Now, I like mindless carnage. But not when it's prefaced with an Inglourious Basterds sort of flavor, fearless, extremely Tarantino-ish and excellent dialogue, all the things you'd want in a Tarantino film, really.

You gotta give DiCaprio at least a silent applause for the should-have-been-the-ending scene *near* the end of the film, before it goes totally blows its own spirit to hell.

I'll forgive that Foxx has nothing to work with when it comes to his character. Django just is totally one-dimensional, practically a side-character to the people you sort of came to see, particularly Waltz, DiCaprio, and Jackson. The camera generally follows Django, but because he's so astonishingly under-written (kind of the exact opposite of your usual Tarantino character) with almost nothing to do the whole film, it's so inconsistent, the ending takes away at least two stars from an otherwise pretty awesome film.

After the should-have-ended-there scene happens, everything comes toppling down, and you start waiting for the film to end--primarily because it just did, and you know what's going to happen already. There aren't any surprises. There's just a rampage. But it's there for practically no reason, and shouldn't have existed, because it cheapens the film horribly.

Everything up until the last 45 minutes? Frickin' awesome. Beautiful. DiCaprio gets a damned fine performance in.

But those last 45 minutes? As one-star as something can get, and even worse that it was preceded by so much top-notch work by everyone involved in the film. It's like they ripped out Tarantino completely then (it's cued precisely when that what-the-hell-is-this-doing-here modern rap song starts playing during that one gunfight...You know the one), and the climactic scene is nothing but raw Michael Bay. I *know* it's terribly cliche to even mention his name, but if that's not what Bay would have done...Yeah, it actually works here.

5258460,1,B00947NAHU,"There are so many things wrong with this movie, it's hard to decide where to begin.  It's billed as a western, but it's just a bunch of hateful baloney about the Old South, created to pander to blacks and leftists who love to hate southerners, and hipsters who are convinced that Tarantino is some kind of ""artist.""  From the profane, modern-day ghetto language, to the terrible rap music, the designer sunglasses, the ridiculous blood spatters, the cartoonish outfits, and the ridiculous southern accents, it's all a disjointed pile of rubbish.  Tarantino takes every Southern stereotype imaginable, and exaggerates them all to the point of sheer absurdity.  The whites all talk with cartoonish, ridiculously exaggerated southern accents, and occupy themselves by standing around all day beating and torturing their slaves.  The plantation owners dress like Colonel Sanders.  And of course, there's the obligatory incest stereotype (it's repeatedly implied that there's an incestuous relationship going on between Calvin and his sister).  The only white person portrayed favorably throughout this entire film is the German bounty hunter.  In this film, southern whites are all drunks, cowards, whores, hicks, reprobates, letches, oppressors, buffoons, thieves, extortionists, sadists, killers, or a combination of several of these.

The film is set in ""1858 - 2 years before the Civil War,"" as stated in the opening credits.  Since the Civil War began in 1861, 1858 was actually THREE years prior to the war - so apparently Tarantino can't even get his dates right or perform simple kindergarten-level arithmetic.

When Django teams up with his rescuer, King, he's told that they are going to Tennessee - to a plantation in Gatlinburg, no less - for their next bounty.  Never mind that there weren't actually plantations in Gatlinburg, which is in the mountains, and was sparsely inhabited by millers and extremely poor dirt farmers, not planters.  Furthermore, the plantation we see in the film, supposedly set in Tennessee, is none other than Evergreen, in Louisiana - one of the grand, white, ornate plantation houses outside New Orleans.  Tarantino is obviously another ignorant Hollywood liberal, who knows nothing about the Old South or its plantations.  If he did, he would know that Tennessee plantation houses were Greek Revival / Federal style, and there's no Spanish moss hanging from the trees in Tennessee.  Spanish moss is found in the deep south - Florida, south Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana - not Tennessee.  As for the planter, ""Big Daddy,"" not only does he not speak with anything close to an actual Tennessee accent, his attire doesn't even resemble that of a Tennessee plantation owner - it's Don Johnson dressed like Colonel Harland Sanders, for God's sake.  Want a bucket of fried chicken, Django?

The gunplay in this film is sheer nonsense.  Our (anti)hero, Django (who in 1858, has somehow managed to find a very slick pair of designer sunglasses), is a recently freed ex-slave.  An 1850's slave would have never fired, or even held a gun before, yet we're to believe that Django is an inhumanly fast draw and impossibly accurate crack shot with a pistol - capable of shooting the eyes and nose out of a snowman without even taking aim.  Throughout the film, he is a master of mayhem - shooting down hordes of armed men, turning them into bloody, twitching corpses with their entrails blown out, while taking nary a scratch himself.  And we're shown ridiculous amounts of blood splatter whenever a bullet strikes human flesh.  Mere pistol shots create splashes of blood that make grapeshot look like bb's.  Speaking of cannon...the gunfire in this film is, like everything else, ridiculously exaggerated, made to sound downright thunderous.  Anyone who has ever fired real guns before, knows that gunfire is a pop-pop-popping noise, much more like a firecracker than a cannon.  The final gunshot of the film is the most preposterous.  Django shoots Calvin's sister - as always, lightning fast - from the top of the stairs.  Although she has been struck by a pistol shot, from above, instead of merely falling over, her body is literally blown away - plum out of the scene - as if she has just been struck - from the side - by a cannon.  Even cartoons are more realistic than this.

This movie isn't believable, even by action movie standards, and it's a dismal failure as a ""western.""  Even if Tarantino's intent was just satire, even if he was just trying to lampoon the Old South, he didn't even succeed at that.  Humor, in order to actually be humorous, must be rooted in truth, or contain at least an element of truth, and there's nothing remotely truthful or realistic here.  Due to the dismal intelligence level of America's youth and millennials, there are many who will not only be entertained by ignorant garbage like this, but will, unfortunately, believe that it's actually a realistic portrayal the 19th Century American south.  The hipsters who kiss Tarantino's butt insist that his films, like this piece of hogwash, are ""works of art,"" and that if you don't see the brilliance in all of this lunacy, then you're just not smart enough to ""get it.""  Nevertheless, Tarantino wouldn't know a good film if he fell into it.  I'm glad I saw this on cable, instead of wasting my money watching it at a theater.",1417478400,6,5346,5.006787330316742

5258481,5,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained a Western film that takes place in America's pre-Civil War South when slavery still existed. The story is about a partnership between an African-American slave named Django and a German-born bounty hunter,Dr. Schultz,who is on disguise as a dentist. They are on the trail of the murderous Brittle brothers and finding Django's long lost wife,Broomhilda from her cruel plantation owner named Calvin Candie. Initially,Schultz bought his partner as a slave from outlaws. But he promised him freedom and split the bounties with him if he assists him in hunting down other outlaws throughout the winter. Django agreed as long on the condition that they must also find Broomhilda. Added to story is Django's training as a bounty hunter. All ends well when Django takes Broomhilda from her cell,bids farewell to his fallen mentor and ignites the dynamite he has planted throughout the mansion at the end.

This is a 165-minute long film. But in spite of its length,it is definitely not a waste of time as the viewer gets to witness the horrors of slavery in the past in addition to getting another great Spaghetti Western movie in the tradition of The Good,The Bad And The Ugly. It was definitely wildly extravagant,violent,funny and outrageously entertaining yet it also dealt well with the themes of racism and slavery. We are also treated to a exciting performances by the cast especially from DiCaprio who definitely nailed the portrayal of a plantation owner. Finally,we are treated to a clever screenplay and amazing direction from Tarantino that there is no doubt that this adds to his list of great films.",1416614400,,1623,5.0559701492537314

5258493,4,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino's notion to good violence making good cinema is not even controversial, it is a pissed off teenager's idea of entertainment.  Still, he knows how to make a good show.  This movie takes a tough stomach, no doubt, similar to a video game in how it combines violence, entertainment and heros too.  I appreciate what justice it does for african americans whose heritage has slavery.  This movie makes a bold statement of ""We have no sympathy for southern slave owners, and we accrue no karma in liberally executing them"".  Leonardo D. plays a chilling villian whose character is meant to show the truth of how morbid and depraved some of these planation owners were, and he nails that character.  Christoph Walsh is our sympathetic father figure basically, or a good friend, and Jamie Foxx plays the hero whose arc is to ""break the chains"", realize empowerment, and be a hero, a revolutionary to his fellow ensalved culture.  Quentin Tarantino casts himself in a cameo of a character you would love to blow up with dynamite :-)  This is a real entertaining movie for a certain kind of mood and vibration.  I am rarely in the mood for it, but I'm glad it's there when I want it.  Movies about revolutionaries during historical periods of oppression should get more credit on that basis, and Quentin T. put this movie out at a good time where, as hard as it can be to take, people really needed this movie - for empowerment of a kind.  It filled a hole and, I believe, has helped a great would to heal a little for a significant portion of African Americans who still feel out of place.  At least, i think that was the aim, and I feel the message was carried through very well.

We see the flying, spurting blood of Django's revenge, the cagey logic of the German dentist (who is  a bounty hunter), and the surprising revelation of Alexandre Dumas (white father and black mother), and the surprising ending of the movie.

5258509,3,B00947NAHU,"17 Jan 2016.  After seeing the Hateful 8, which I liked very much, I do think Tarantino is making a statement about racism in Django Unchained and failing, at least for me, because the characters and action is too stereotyped.  However, I would raise its rating to 3 stars from 2 stars  because I feel more confident that he is attempting to address the evils of racism in his own way.

Tarantino has great technical skill, a distinctive style, and he tries to subvert what have become movie cliches by mixing genres.  I like but not love some of his movies, but Django does not work for me.  Slavery is a serious subject.  The effects of it still linger today in the institutional and individual racism we see around us if we only look with eyes that can see.

  Tarantino does not shrink from showing the horror of slavery, but the problem is that he does so while satirizing Westerns, a ""spaghetti"" Western in particular, a not so serious genre for most of us and in his usual over-the-top, unrealistic way.  Along the way he pokes fun at the illogic and stereotypical characters in almost all Westerns.

  I suppose his point is that revenge Westerns that bring justice to a previously corrupt town are not that different from the stereotypical movies about Seal teams killing Bin Laden.  Maybe his ultra-violence is interrogating the idea that violence can redeem.  Maybe he is asking his white audience whether they can truly root for an African-American slave who justly blows up Candieland (America) .  Maybe he is riffing on Maya Angelou's poem about how a black man will believe a white man is on his side when the white man gives the black man a gun.

  The problem is that Django is still essentially a one-demensional character even if he hesitates before finally committing to his career as a bounty hunter.  The Doctor is too even if he hates slavery and speaks French and German.  Candie is too, and that is the biggest problem.  We hate him like we hate all the stock big bosses in Westerns.  He is not real to us.  He can't be like us, but, of course, the slave owners were like us in having the same basic genetic code and like many of us in being white Americans.  We are not so different as we would like to believe.

  This is why I give it two stars.  I would give it only one star, but Tarantino does what he does with his usual great skill.  The actors are compelling albeit in limited roles.  It does seem to be trying to make a statement about slavery and the world today.",1415318400,9,2499,4.472283813747229

5258517,2,B00947NAHU,"Despite some merits that are rather technical in nature, ""DU"" is an exercise in self-indulgence that wallows in violence for its own sake. Yes, antebellum slavery and its cruelties are the context, and in depicting the heartrending struggle to reunite families sundered by the slave trade, the film promises much.  But because Tarantino's forte is chasing cheap thrills, he gets it exactly backward. Countless BLACKS were abused and murdered by WHITES, not the other way around as this revenge-fantasy-gone-wrong suggests. Though his ability to elicit strong performances from actors is undeniable, Tarantino dishonors the memory of African Americans who endured slavery. Against all odds, throughout the era of slavery they succeeded in creating and sustaining their own culture, their own networks of kinship, assistance and resistance. Why doesn't Tarantino make a film about THAT? Because the body count would be lower?

One telling achievement of ""Twelve Years A Slave"" is to expose ""Django Unchained"" as the trash that it is. It also contains brilliant, moving depictions of life in the quarters: just the few minutes of the funeral scene tells us far more than Tarantino's entire film.

5258528,5,B00947NAHU,"Its hyper-violent, brutal, adventurous, gut-wrenching, intense, and exciting. It was controversial and taboo, and yet praised and awarded. Quentin Tarantinos Django Unchained is a phenomenal motion picture presented with excellent writing, performances, and soundtrack that surely destines it to be a classic movie remembered for years.
 Quentin Tarantino is a modern day filmmaker that has forever etched his name among Hollywoods greats. His films Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, and Jackie Brown are already considered American classics, even making Empire Magazines 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, with Pulp Fiction in the top ten (Empire's 500 Greatest)! Tarantinos signature style features scenes saturated with violence and dialogue, lots and lots of dialogue. The average movie script is ninety pages long, however Django is 168 pages. Tarantino loves to make his characters conversations as realistic and natural as possible, with his characters going off on tangents, minute points, etc, just like real life. While it adds onto the length, it makes his films stand out. It makes them feel real, and if the characters feel real, the danger feels real, further drawing the audience into the story. In addition, the violence is in-your-face gruesome. This adds to the realism, showing the audience just how much danger the characters are in. If theres no danger and the characters don't feel real, then the story falls apart because the audience has no reason to care. Theyd only be watching actors running around on screen doing nothing.
 Horror director Eli Roth once said if you don't want to be scared in a horror film, don't close your eyes, close your ears (Go Ahead and Scream). Why is that? Because visuals just aren't enough. Movies are sad, scary, funny, dramatic, intense, etc. because the music makes us feel that way. If your main character is supposed to be a badass, you wouldnt play Fleetwood Macs Landslide. Instead, Tarantino picks out songs like John Legends Who Did That to You? Django rides off into the sunset with his gun in hand, that song blaring in the background with its powerful, cool, beat and you know hes about to throw down with some baddies and come out on top. Otherwise you're just watching Django ride a horse, no emotion, just a horse.
 Whats an excellent story without an amazing actor to bring the story to life? Well, its a book, but were talking about a movie here. Actors are the life of a film, in fact, they are the most crucial element. Clunky writing can be disguised by brilliant delivery from a stellar performance,  or fantastic writing can be muddled by an abysmal actor, but add Tarantinos signature style with performances from Jaime Foxx, Christoph Waltz, and Leonardo DiCaprio and you have an instant classic. Jaime Foxx stars as the titular character. Hes the lead, the star, the most important character on the screen. Every scene demands the spotlight on him and if he cant hold it, the audience will look away in boredom. Christoph Waltz serves as his mentor, and voice of reason. Without him, Jaime has no one to feed off of to boost his performance and make his character likable. If the main character isn't likable and the audience would rather see him get his head blown off, then the movie doesnt do its job. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the villain, the opposition to the main character reaching his goal. Leo has to convince the audience that hes not one to be trifled with, and that hes a scary, intimidating, man, or else theres no tension and again no reason to watch the movie. In Django Unchained, these A-list actors do their jobs, and they do them right. Jamie is heroic, Christoph is charming, and Leo is terrifying, making the film an intense, emotional, thrill-ride.
 Django Unchained is an excellent film because it excels in the three most important elements in film; writing, acting, and song choice. The emotions are emphasized by the soundtrack. The characters are fleshed out by the dialogue. And the actors bring it all together into a truly wonderful film from a truly amazing director.",1414627200,,4083,4.954744525547445

5258534,5,B00947NAHU,"Wow.

I am rarely at a loss for words, but am almost there after watching this film.

It is bold, funny, terrifying, grotesque, moving, surprising, and more.  It manages to confront the cruelty of slavery head-on, and simultaneously: have unsympathetic black characters (chiefly, Samuel L. Jackson's), use racially-abusive language, employ intentionally cheesy/campy music, and be entertaining and surprising.

I leave feeling there is more to unpack, and/or more I will never unpack.  Thank you, Mr. Tarantino.",1414281600,,511,5.671052631578948

Like..wow, amazing,..blacks aren't so stupid after all, they can actually (fill in blank...ride a horse, learn german, shoot a gun, speak english, outsmart bad guys,...yuck, stuff that normal white people do all the time is somehow cause for great surprise and admiration if a black guy can do it,..yeah, an extension of black history month, pure liberal condescension,..like, wow, my dog stood on 2 legs,..he's almost as good as a real human!)
The movie was way too long, like they forgot to edit it. You could walk away for 20 minutes and not miss anything. The story made zero sense, and it's obvious they knew it,..they had to keep explaining it over and over WHY they couldn't just go and buy the female slave like everyone else (because the movie would be over in 10 minutes)",1414195200,8,925,4.860759493670886

5258564,4,B00947NAHU,"I really enjoyed this movie. I think the main actors were fantastic in their roles and Leonardo DiCaprio was very outstanding in his role. The reason I can't give it five stars is because for the first two-thirds of the movie or so it's not really ""Django Unchained"" it's more like Dr. King Schulz Unchained"" who really acts as more of the moral compass of the duo with him and Django. Also, his last decision in the film was, incredibly ridiculous to say the least and, in my opinion, undid every good or badass thing he ever did because he almost ruined EVERYTHING. The final third (or quarter, if you see it that way) is when we finally understand why this movie was given its title.

Also on the character of Broomhilda or ""Hilde"" played by the gorgeous goddess Kerry Washington, many were disappointed that given Washington's regular portrayal of the very strong and capable Olivia Pope on ABC's Scandal that she would play the role of a damsel in distress in this film. While Hilde is a damsel in distress, it's worth noting that a woman in color is being portrayed as desirable, sexy, and worth killing for in this film (a role/aspect usually reserved for white female characters in films such as these with a white male protagonist), something I found comfort in.",1412640000,,1271,4.648888888888889

5258577,5,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained is many things undoubtedly.  It is, undoubtedly, a genre-film masterpiece.  It is, undoubtedly, gory.  It is, undoubtedly, just as full of entertainment as it is full of substance. Lots of movies are like this, however. But its 'stand-out' element is derived from its being first and foremost, and just as undoubtedly so, Tarantino.

It's a cliche thing to say.  But the addictive motif of Tarantino's films - that keeps us coming back more and more - is Tarantino's personality.  We've grown to love it as it has been present from the VERY beginning.  It has never lacked.  Even when the source material is not his own (Jackie Brown) he MAKES it his own.  Slavery was real.  MANY of the things you will see in this film DID HAPPEN.  In the sense of the cultural and social stage much of the source material in this film is not Tarantino's.  However it is made his.  He takes us on a journey to an era that existed.  However you're riding in the Tarantino seat. We find this also in Inglourious Basterds.

Django is bloody.  Django is crass.  Django is hard to watch at times.  I feel i need only comment on these things as a story synopsis should be on this page somewhere.",1411689600,3,1191,4.537735849056604
5258578,5,B00947NAHU,"A superb story. Horrific and inhumane circumstaces. Ingenuity and justice personified. Restored love. Retribution rendered. Justice and vengeance satisfied. DJANGO UNCHAINED! What an awesome motion picture. Compelling and very dramatic. What could the circumstances possibly be? And what could a fair-minded, rouge Caucasian Dentist who moonlights as a Bounty Hunter have anything in common with a Negro Slave, he's never even met? And yet, he hunts for him, finds him, free's him and then..., makes him his Partner?! Why? And in so doing, he teaches him to hunt, shoot, kill and take back, all that's been taken or stolen from him. This emancipated slave with a score to settle - DJANGO, is magnificently portrayed by Actor Jamie Foxx. Having restored his freedom and self-respect, as a bonus, his Bounty Hunting tutor helps him find his enslaved and tortured wife. Who, is owned by a ruthless, cold, calculating, sadistic and brutal slave master, superbly portrayed by Academy Award winning Actor, handsome and very classy - Leonardo DiCaprio, and is being held captive on his plantation, called: Candyland. And aside from buying and selling slaves, one of his heinous 'past times' is deliberately pitting big, strong, Black Men (his slaves), against one another in a wrestling match to the bloody and gruesome end. He and other slave owners gamble on the results. His insane glee is personified when the sound of bones are popped, cracked and broken, and blood starts to flow. Actor Don Johnson of the famed 'Miami Vice' program, also co-stars as a Plantation Master and owner of slaves. So, who would dare to take down such a monstrous cruel madman, who seemingly has a vice-grip choke hold on his Candyland slaves? An intelligent and enlightened, brave Dentist and his newly-made, Assistant Bounty Hunter and former slave, that's who! Twist and turns in story and content... a plenty, with a powerful and explosive ending! In vivid color on a single Blue-ray disc, this intense drama DJANGO UNCHAINED is mesmerizing!

5258666,4,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino's  anachronistic and violent  2012 depiction of a slave turned bounty hunter breathes new life into an old idea.
  Based on a film from the 1960s, in which the title character was played by Franco Nero ( who cameos as one Amerigo Vessepi in this film as well), it is rafe with the music from Westerns of that era.
  The piece showcases Jaime Foxx as the  title character who, having been sold  from  the Carrucan ( Bruce Dern)Plantation in the Antebellum South of 1858 after he and his wife, Broomhilda Von Schaft(an appropriately timid and cautious Kerry Washington) tried to run away.
  Dr. King Schultz( Oscar winner Christoph Waltz), a bounty hunter in the role of a traveling dentist, stumbles upon  Django as he is in a chain gang, and frees him after Django reveals knowledge about some men Schultz was searching for upon Schultz' inquiry.
  After killing the slave drivers and freeing the  chain gang members, Schultz directs  all the slaves except Django to go North, pointing the North Star out to them as guide, as they can begin their journey towards full freedom under cover of darkness.
 Taking responsibility for Django, Schultz teaches him how to draw a gun, and after wintering in the mountains, during which time he learns of Django's desire to free his wife, the two set off on their bounty hunts. Django reveals that his wife's former mistress was German and taught her the language, and there is a reverent moment when Django tells Schultz her name, and Schultz tells  Django the German tale  of the mythical Broomhilda, and of how her lover Siegfried overcomes all obstacles to free her from imprisonment. Django sees how his own life mirrors this myth.
  As the two work their way  towards their  ultimate goal of freeing Hilde we follow them  on their trek to find  those on the ""Wanted"" posters through outpost towns, including one in which Gil Tatum(Tom Wopat) presides. As a freedman riding a horse, Django makes quite an impression on many of the white townspeople he meets and not always a favorable one.
 Schultz reluctantly accompanies Django to the deep South to confront a plantation owner known as ""Big Daddy""(an unrecognizable Don Johnson) where they carry out contractual killings of three brothers they were looking for, as well as a plantation hand  who was about to whip a female slave.
  Big Daddy later leads a group of proto Klansmen, including a comical Jonah Hill against King and Django as they camp in the hills one night, only to be foiled.
  After Schultz searches through sales records, he informs Django that his wife has been sold to Candie Land, the most notorious plantation in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, and the two journey there, encountering the plantation owner at a house of pleasure, where he is first seen enjoying a wrestling match between two slaves, which ends with the winner killing the loser by hammering in the latter's skull. His lawyer/business partner, Dennis Christopher's Mr. Moguy, introduces him.
 As Calvin Candie, Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio  is at his most demonic as he plays off against Foxx, who previously beat him out for the Best Actor Oscar in 2005. His expression rarely softens as he spews out White supremacist views while dining with Schultz and Django.
 As they proceed towards Candie Land with with slaves and  white field hands in tow, an escaped slave named D'Artangan (Ato Essandoh, who previously worked with DiCaprio in ""Blood Diamond"") who has been recaptured, is ordered to be devoured by dogs by Calvin.
  Upon arrival, they are greeted by Candie's equally treacherous  house slave, Stephen(Samuel L. Jackson), who informs Calvin that Hilde also tried to escape and is being punished by being placed in the hotbox on the plantation grounds. Django sees his beloved being doused with water and dragged out naked and demeaned and his righteous indignation must be restrained.
 Acting on her brother's orders,Calvin's widowed sister, Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly(Laura Cayouette) escorts Hilde to Schultz' room after he expressed interest in this German-speaking slave, and it is there that he reunites her with her husband.
 Before this tale ends, we shall see how the conniving Stephen tries to waylay the attempt to win Hilde's freedom, and how, despite a personal loss, Django will indeed prove to be a Siegfried to his beloved  Broomhilda, with a very justifiable bloodbath along the way.
  The film features many cameos of actors whose popularity was at its height in the 60s and 70s, including Russ Tamblyn (and also his daughter, Amber) as Son of a Gunfighter, Robert Carradine as a tracker, Ted Neely, best known as the title character in ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" as another tracker, and Michael Parks, best known as Adam in ""The Bible: In the Beginning""  as a mining company employee along side director Tarantino himself.
 Fast paced and appropriately filled  with graphic violence, there is much to keep track of. I found the ending gratifying, and took note of the nod to Roy Rogers and Trigger, finding myself singing along with the closing song when viewing it.
 ""Django Unchained"" stands as a graphically painful reminder of America's past, but evokes the question, ""What might the world have been like if there had been men like Django at that time?""",1406678400,,5285,4.960182025028441

5258698,4,B00947NAHU,"Yes it is graphic and violent and I can understand some of the criticism in the beginning, although I think Spike Lee, et al needed to see it before condemning it outright.
 Django Unchained has a unique historical perspective that many depictions of this era have lacked, it has an American Black 'Western' Hero, which in and of itself is unusual despite African Americans playing a significant role in the development of the American West.
 it does not flinch when portraying the vicious dichotomy of the institution of slavery-its obvious sheer brutality, but also the intimacy of the relationships between slaver and slave, which led to the slavery being called among other things by outsiders a 'peculiar institution', many of the slaves were extremely close to the slavers, in their homes, in their kitchens preparing their food, caring for the sick, in their bedrooms, etc., and this is often overlooked. And yet many of the slavers were still capable of inflicting some of the most harsh and cruel treatment known towards their slaves?
Yes the N word is used repeatedly, but in that era, I am not sure the film could even remotely be authentic in the sense of setting of time and place, without it. 12 years a Slave and other films have also used the word repeatedly. I have a mixed race background and recognize the difference of the appropriate use and the slanderous use of the word.
A very good movie overall, Samuel Jackson is amazing as is Christoph Waltz, I enjoyed seeing someone of clearly German descent being portrayed so decently and kindly in the area of race relations-so often persons of German descent get such a negative stereotype subsequent to the horror of the Third Reich, etc., studies have shown in America, German immigrants were often the most racially and ethnically tolerant of Caucasian peoples in the US.",1405123200,,1841,4.878594249201278

5258717,5,B00947NAHU,"Oh My Goodness!  I have lost count on how many times I have watched this movie.  I absolutely love it.  I love Christopher Waltz's role he plays and I love his beard!  He made an excellent bounty hunter.  Also, Samuel L Jackson, what a mean old ""colored man"" - if looks could kill, I for sure, would not have survived the era of slavery.  And then there is Jamie Foxx, I love him as a singer, as a comedian, and as an actor.  He is so talented and very handsome.  Django (Foxx) joins up with Dr King Schultz (Waltz) as a bounty hunter to find some wanted criminals in exchange for Django's freedom so he then can find his slaved wife, Broom Hilda (Kerry Washington)  Lots of blood and guts in this movie.  Everyone in this movie played their parts so well.  I'm sure I would not have enjoyed living during the time of slavery.  It is sad as to the way the South treated a colored person and I'm glad Quentin Tarantino brought this again to the public eye.",1404259200,,955,4.2444444444444445

5258722,5,B00947NAHU,"I usually do not like Tarantino films as I almost walked out of the theater when I first saw Pulp Fiction.  However, Django is superbly done, tells a story, and allows both African-Americans and Caucasians a vicarious ""hero"" to feel good about.  It is engaging start to finish, entertaining, and down right hilarious at times. Many people criticized Tarantino for what seems a trivial depiction of slavery and extensive use of the term n*gger (I'm African-American by the way...not that this should matter). If you can get past that (and the extensive blood and violence) a story emerges that is well worth watching. Do not look for historical accuracy and a sympathetic telling of slavery. Watch and enjoy the film. All actors do a fine job. Mr. Tarantino deserves much kudos and accolades for this film.  Note: I am also a huge fan of Spike Lee and I also recommend Spike's ""The Miracle at St. Anna"" (masterful storytelling and has at least one actor featured in Django...though St. Anna was produced first) and his ""Inside Man"" with Denzel and Clive Owen is likewise great, but I like St Anna more.",1403913600,,1101,4.78421052631579

The acting, writing, cinematography are all top-notch. One notable thing is the soundtrack, which uses tracks from various Westerns, some folks songs and even one or two rap songs. It all culminates in an action-packed, violent, tragic, yet hilarious ride. The bonus features leave a bit to be desired, I expected maybe a deleted scene or maybe some interviews with Quentin or the actors. All there is are some featurettes on the effects and production design. Don't get me wrong, I like these very much, I just would've liked more.

5258736,4,B00947NAHU,"Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kerry Washington stole the show from Jamie Foxx. I don't think he held his own at all in this film. It's almost as if he was the sidekick right until the very end where he's fighting by himself. Even when Samuel L. Jackson appeared, he became a scene stealer from DaCaprio, and then DaCaprio stole it back, and then just when you think you forgot Christoph Waltz, he steals the scene back too. Jamie Foxx seems like he should have A.) been pushed to act more and out shine everyone else (since he is supposed to be the main character--his character's name is the frickin title), or B.) He should've been re-casted altogether. If you do a movie, make sure the main character can hold their own against all the side characters--even Kerry Washington out-shined him. Tarantino should've just named this film ""Unchained"". I was entertained by every other character but Foxx.

5258746,5,B00947NAHU,"Whew! I just finished watching this film and my heart is still beating double time. I loved ""inglorious Bastards"" for the same reason I love Django Unchained. Historical ""victims"" get to avenge themselves. Historical victims get to play heroes. Thank you Quentin. An aside: The ""N' word is used less in this film than in his other films, I believe. I'm an oldster. Civil Rights era black woman. I wasn't sure how Q would handle this subject. ""Inglorious Bastards"" gave me hope. I loved seeing Jewish people avenge themselves in a film. Yes Django is in the tradition of ""Spaghetti Westerns."" Yes it's a ludicrous story, impossible to imagine for most of us. Thank goodness Q took a chance with the ""slave era"" genre and turned it on it's heels. It's hard to make peace with some of the scenes. (A dog tearing a black man apart at the ""heroes"" request, for instance.) It brings home the point, I imagine, that everyone's humanity is compromised when you enslave human beings. The enslaved and the ""masters"" become less humane. I hope Tarantino will use some of his profits to green light other projects on slavery that take new chances. As we've seen with Holocaust films down through the years, our society needs many points of view to re-imagine this subject. The slaves were never allowed to tell their own stories. The slave owners, drenched in shame, haven't told their stories either. Their women remained silent. The men I shall forever think of as ""bag-heads"" thanks to Quentin Tarantino--the Klan- don't write books about their cruel exploits either. The history of slavery, the continuing effects of racism on our society continue on. New myths, and new stories, films such as this, let us understand that history more completely. New Myths, new flawed heroes like Django, change our idea of what could have been, what might have been, and what actually occurred during that time. My prayer is that someday this society will be free of one of the worst examples of man's inhumanity to man in modern history. The enslavement of human beings, the sale of their children and their children's children for hundreds of years. (And I'm not comparing atrocities, mind you. I've studied the Holocaust since I was a young girl in hopes of understanding why human beings can be so cruel.) Lastly, I did find reasons to laugh during this film. A number of times I laughed aloud or shook my head the story was so wildly imaginative and unlikely. Ludicrous is the best word. But what great story telling. Surprising. Tension filled. Great Characters I'll never forget. Well done QT. Well done.",1401494400,21,2589,4.833333333333333

5258748,2,B00947NAHU,"I used to be a Tarantino fan until he started making movies that are pretty much just live-action cartoons.  I understand that it's his style to be anachronistic by including things that didn't exist during the time period, like sunglasses and dynamite.  That's all well and good.  I'm a big fan of westerns, however, and I can't say I really want to see a fun, colorful, outrageous western like Django Unchained.  It's just not true to life, and that's my main objection.  When I watch a western, I want it to be pretty serious and gritty.  For example, I thought the KKK hood scene with Jonah Hill in Django was predictable and lazy writing (not to mention unfunny).  I don't know.  Of course you can't go wrong with Christoph Waltz (his was one of the only characters that, to me, seemed to belong in the movie).  His performance made the movie worth it for me.  Also, we all know that Tarantino can write dialogue (however indulgent and long-winded it may be).  However, some of it just goes in circles and seems to really lead nowhere).  I wanted to like Django Unchained, but I didn't.  I love westerns, but not this one.  I'll take The Proposition with Guy Pearce or even the original spaghetti westerns that Tarantino was attempting to ape (at least those seemed populated with semi-realistic characters and situations).  Like I said, though, Django Unchained, to me, was nothing more than a fun experiment.  Why it was nominated for Oscars and whatnot is an absolute mystery to me.  Was this really a great, original screenplay?  I didn't think so.  Those who are more forgiving of someone making a mockery of a seriously cool genre may like it more.",1401235200,,1659,4.678200692041522

Yuks and Barfs aplenty in this 'omage - fromage?' is it to the Spaghetti Western dear old pops loved to chortle about?  Not historically correct - but after all it is a movie - not quite a documentary.

Immense - over the top - cruel and gory - there also seem to be touches of  'Judge Roy Bean' and occasionally a HUGE nod in Mel Brooks direction [BLAZING SADDLES] ...... now just where was a good old barroom beauty number ... ala Dietrich, but that's another movie.  Great Plot along the lines of a Classic Greek Drama [Nod to Peter Fonda] ..... THIS really isn't a period to be proud of .... ""Gone With The Wind"" it soilenli ain't .....

Performances?  Leo DiCaprio was robbed - ditto Samuel L Jackson - fine, fine performances - Mr. Jackson was literally unrecognizable - cane in hand - shuffling along like a twisted Clytemnestra figure - until at the very end .......and Leo?  Charming, Genteel, Funny, Endearing and a product of that culture [but one sees too much though - this is not history - this is pure entertainment] ......it  is also great to see Dennis Christopher back on the screen as DiCaprios ""companion"" [?] .... one is never quite sure and one does not venture into that territory .....

Christoph Waltz as the German Dentist turned Bounty Hunter?  A nice performance but we found it rather close to his previous Tarantino outing .... could possibly be a Grand or Great-Grand relation to the SS Officer ['Inglourious""]?  Lots of delightful, meticulous European Theatrical technique  - without much heart ........

Jamie Fox?  Great charm and reserved dignity .... and not 'all over the place' ......a refreshing new facet to his screen persona.

Lots of delightful cameos - Bruce Dern, Don Johnson, Ted Neeley [JCSS], Tom Wopat, Don Stroud, etc ...... a veritable ""Whos Who"" ....

If one has to nitpick - it's again the costumes that seem just too pristine in some sections - especially the Tarantino cameo sequence later ... what no sweaty hatbands, distressed shirts, muddy pants .. little more greasy and grime?  BUT again - this is ""Spaghetti Western territory"" ..... not Kubrick!  Same with some of the make-up on the Ladies ......pencil lined brows  - circa 1858?

The video quality of the blu-ray is excellent, but I wasn't crazy about the audio mix.  In order to get the volume level to the point that the dialogue was completely understandable, when dialogue ended the music and/or other non-spoken parts of the movie came roaring in at a level that required the volume to be turned down.

As for the movie itself, for the first two hours, it was intense, it was entertaining, and at times it was very funny with a couple of obvious nods to ""Blazing Saddles"".  The story line was good, the cast was great, the acting was fantastic, and even the directing was good.  The decision to include modern day rap music, though, was, to say the least, puzzling.

Then it unfortunately descended into that dark place where Quentin Tarantino lives, and all hell broke loose in a violent, disgusting, murderous and very un-entertaining (unless, of course, you happen to be a homicidal maniac) manner, making it nearly impossible to keep up with the body count or the gallons of blood that spewed from corpses like Texas oil gushers.

5258772,4,B00947NAHU,"""Django Unchained"" is Quentin Taratino's  big, bloody Valentine to the ""Spaghetti Westerns"" genre, a lef-of-center off-shoot of the American Western genre that predominated American movies and TV in the 20th century. Unlike traditional  American Westerns, which usually depicted the 19th century west as the fulcrum of American Exceptionalism, Spaghetti Westerns featured steely-eyed, mostly silent amoral men who looked at the world through squinty eyes and rode around the West in wide-shoots and close-ups, acting out stories that were part existentialist sighs and part exercises in European-Marxist praxis (although ironically many were produced in Franco's Spain, go figure), usually in accompaniment to an Ennio Morricone soundtrack playing in the background, utilizing rattlesnakes, the cracks of whips, church bells, and lush orchestrations  giving  the carnage on the screen at times almost an operatic or  balletic effect.

Like movies it is playing homage to,  ""Django Unchained"" features Ennio Morricone music, along with a subversive plot line, a necessity for films of this genre. ""Django"" tells the story of a slave (Jamie Foxx, who joins the ranks of such masters of this forum as Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, and Steve McQueen. Stars in these films are strong and silent, with little dialogue  to work with. Foxx, with one look of his eyes, can speak volumes, and he shoulders the responsibility of carrying this epic  with a lightness that suggests he was born for this kind of role) who is purchased by a 21st century liberal's idea of a 19th century bounty hunter,  Dr. Schultz(  Christoph Waltz, delivering a master class in character acting). After Django aids the bounty hunter in tracing down several brutal workers from a plantation Django once tried to escape from, Dr. Schultz grants Django his freedom and agrees to join Django in rescuing his wife, still in bondage at a large plantation deep in the dark pre-Civil War heart of Mississippi (the plantation owner is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who becomes white supremacy incarnate, the other villain is a ""House Negro"" played by Samuel L. Jackson; neither DiCaprio or Jackson compromise an inch in their performances. They are totally dedicated to the evil their characters represent. DiCaprio is a Devil, and Jackson a man who did not sell his soul to the Devil, and still knows where it is, but loaned it out, and long ago forgot where he put it.  (In interviews Jackson stated he based his performance on Clarence Thomas.)

Of course, the true star of any Tarantino movie is Quentin Tarantino, and in many ways ""Django Unchained"" is his most accomplished film yet. While some characteristic Tarantino hallmarks  are present -- the use of pop songs on the soundtrack, populating the supporting cast with action movie heroes and TV stars -- others, such as titled chapters or a jumbled narrative structure, are not. Unlike a typical Tarantino film, the narrative structure in ""Django Unchained"" is pretty straightforward, with the exception of a few very quick flashbacks. Apparently Tarantino believed the basic story was strong enough to carry the film, and was a story best told in as simple a cinematic manner as possible. Like many Tarantino films, ""Django Unchained"" is the story of a character on a quest, a journey, one driven by revenge (and, in this case, by love as well). Tarantino draws on a number of sources, from German myth to classic American Westerns, to deliver a story with resonance and one that is uniquely his own. In typical Tarantino style, ""Django Unchained"" features several set pieces of action, very  well done, but none quite on the scale of the ""House of Blue Leaves"" battle in ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" or the burning down of the movie house packed with the Nazi high command at the end of ""Inglorious Basterds,"" which is why I'm giving it four stars instead of 5.

Like many Tarantino films, ""Django Unchained"" does have a long running time (166 minutes), but it does move quickly overall. Tarantino does have his own, deliberate pace when it comes to movies, like the Spaghetti Western directors he so admires, such as Sergio Leone, he seems as interested in the moments leading up to an outbreak of violence as in the actual violence itself. It's one of the artistic traits that separate the truly great directors from the journeymen and the hacks.

  And to his credit, while he does not shy away from depicting a number of all-too-common horrors inflicted on the slave population, Tarantino does not treat those scenes as ""entertainment."" The fun comes when Django becomes an agent of vengeance and justice, unholstering his six-shooters ands blasting the slaveowners and their private armies to the hell they so richly deserve.",1399075200,,4746,5.077120822622108

5258775,5,B00947NAHU,"I don't need to tell die hard fans of the Quentin Tarantino films why they are fans.  They just know.  For those of you who might be seeing your first (if that's possible), let's talk for a moment about this unique writer/director/actor  (born in the same city as my mother, by the way).

The first of his films for me was Reservoir Dogs (1992), which was more like a play, in that the action takes place mostly in a tight ""stage"" environment (inside a warehouse) and the actors make the drama.  This was followed closely by Pulp Fiction (1994), which, by the way, also reinvigorated John Travolta's sagging career in a major way.  Like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction stood out from other ""typical"" movies because it focused on raw things most filmmakers just throw away, such as a long intimate scene in the diner where two hardened killers are arguing over the issues of tasty bacon versus whether pigs are filthy animals.  This sounds stupid if you haven't seen it, but if you have, you know what I mean.

 There is a whole cult of followers for his two part Kill Bill series (2003/2004 and another on the way??) which overhauled the Ninja/Kung Fu genre, and again, the emphasis was on closeup intimacy with the actors as they made the scenes.  Give a good actor enough screen time, let the audience connect with them, and you might find out how good they really are.  Many directors seem afraid to do that, but Quentin trusts those he works with, and they trust him.  The result is unique every time.

My 2009 review on Inglorious Basterds  [...] further discussed Quentin's amazing directing talent and introduced us all to Christoph Waltz, who portrayed Col. Landa, one of the best movie Nazis of all time (right up there with Ronald Lacey from Raiders of the Lost Ark).

Glad to report that Waltz is back in style (after a brief and painful detour in The Three Muskateers 2011) with this latest addition to the Tarantino collection, and he's terrific.  Add in Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Samuel L. Jackson, and you have the stuff of Academy Award dreams.  I predicted it would be on the short list for many awards, but how they will choose who is the ""best actor"" versus ""best supporting actor"" from Waltz, DiCaprio, and Foxx is beyond me. They all do superb jobs.  Quentin likes to appear in a cameo in his films, and this is no exception.  Watch for him toward the end.

As with most Tarantino movies, I challege you to predict his soundtrack of music.  The music he selects is always a fun part of his movies and curiously complimentary.

I won't spoil the story in any way, as I think it best if you experience it yourself without knowing what will happen.  VERY briefly, Django is a freed slave who is on a search for his wife in the South just before the Civil War.  The movie trailer will tell you what you need to know.  But I hope I got you with the teaser ""With A Nod To Mel Brooks"".  As you watch this movie, you should certainly get the feeling that we are experiencing an overhaul of Blazing Saddles (much like the Kill Bill series overhauled the classic Kung Fu genre).  Nowhere is this more clear than the ""nightrider"" scene where they argue over the quality of the hoods.  I thought it might not be possible to do a ""remake"" of the Mel Brooks classic in this politically correct world, but Quentin figured out how-- and what was amazing, a theater filled with equal numbers of Blacks and Whites, laughing and squirming together at the ignorance of the racist characters using the ""N"" word as often as Lindsay Lohan goes in and out of rehab.

Now for my caveat.  Quentin is a big fan of gruesome, raw violence, bordering on comedic, if that's possible.  If you have seen Monty Python and The Holy Grail, you may recall a scene in which the dark knight gets his legs and arms chopped off, with spurting blood, while he continues to insult his attacker.  It's funny because it goes SO over the top.  The violence is like that and it overwhelms the scenes.  Quentin's victims seem to be made of water balloons filled with strawberry pancake syrup and no matter how many times they are shot, they still spray blood for hundreds of feet.  If this type of visual will make you sick, I do not recommend you see the film, or if you do, don't be afraid to shut your eyes during the gory parts.  You will have plenty of warning when this is going to happen.  Quentin does not care if he turns off 25% of the movie-going market--he doesn't compromise what he wants.  But be advised, this stuff is DEFINITELY not for children. Anyone who takes young children (or even pre-adolescents) to these movies should probably be checked out by Child Protective Services.  Likewise, if the ""N"" word offends you, you might want to wait for the AMC edited version on cable.

If you have never seen a Tarantino movie, go with caution, but be prepared to be amazed.  If you have, I don't need to convince you to see this one, because you already went.",1398816000,4,4952,4.512906846240179

Unbelievable; an absolutely care-free vehicle for good and bad, and when I say that i really mean it.

Let's talk about the good in the movie. For one thing it's well written, the characters are great (as usual) and overall the expositions as very well done.

The Acting was superb; everyone played their part and they played it well (especially Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz)
The Story was particularly great; it was just so unique, and in that, it allowed the Director to take this part of history a bit further

All of that being said, the movie is extremely controversial i.e. the things I hated.

The Bad;
Strike 1: OVERLY Racist, and I mean that, I think half of this script was just the N word being said over and over and over again
Strike 2: Brutality, some of the brutal scenes where fine (as far as watching white plantation owners get their asses beat, I LOVED IT), but other areas included racially charged assault and cruelty against women
Strike 3: The Very Fact that at several points in the movie, I wanted to turn it off, but then the movie did something or showed me something and I wanted to keep watching

Believe it or not I actually wasn't bothered by the revenge aspect of this movie; I do understand that black and white people are still divided on such issues and per my opinion I think a movie like this only furthers such tensions. If you stand back and take a nice long look at this film, it could be summed up like this (Below);

Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed a spaghetti style western revenge story in which a freed slave and an anti-racist doctor go on a quest to save his wife and what ensues is a barrage of racial slurs, brutal imagery, stylized violence and the very essence that this movie was made by a white person.

And my only question is, Why? Why did Tarantino find it necessary to make this movie?

In the long run, people are going to fight about this movie and it's only going to cause problems, so for that and every other thing that this movie decided to do, The Bottom Line falls at a

5258795,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantinos latest is another genre mash up, this time blending the over-the-top action of the spaghetti western with the gritty modern revenge fantasy of the blaxploitation flicks of the 70s. The result is a gory and wildly entertaining action movie with standout performances from the entire cast.

The film opens with the iconic Luis Bacalov theme from Django, the ultraviolent Sergio Corbucci western from which this movie attributes its title, and we meet our hero. Django (Jaime Foxx) is a slave being dragged through the south after having been sold away from his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Hes soon purchased and rescued by the charming German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), who rides around in a dentistry wagon. Schultz needs Django to identify three criminals so that he may kill them and claim the reward. Django turns out to be a natural gunfighter, and the two of them become fast friends. Their friendship leads them to attempt a dangerous rescue of Djangos wife, in a parable of the German fantasy The Twilight of the Gods, who has been sold to a particularly villainous slave owner named Monsieur Calvin Candie, owner of the notorious Candyland plantation. His pleasure involves forcing slaves to fight in gladiator style bare-knuckle wrestling matches.

Theres a lot to like about this movie, and the first place to begin is with the acting. Every actor gives a great performance. Jaime Foxx goes through a subtle and yet very noticeable evolution from slave to badass bounty hunter. Hes sympathetic when he needs to be, and extremely dangerous when he has to be. There are several sides to the character that make him a believable an endearing protagonist for this style of movie, and youll find you're on his side when he punishes the wicked. Christoph Waltz turns in yet another flawless performance, making his Dr. Schultz an extremely likeable killer. His every action and expression comes across so nuanced and genuine.

The more surprising performances come from the villains. For the first time I think in any movie, Leonardo DiCaprio appears to be having fun with his character. He plays Monsieur Candie with such an obvious relish its difficult not to find him enticing. His despicable and grinning slave owner is nearly overshadowed by the almost unrecognizable Samuel L. Jackson, who plays his loyal family house slave, Stephen. Its Stephen whos shown to be the worst of the worst, which in this movie says a lot, and Jackson nails every line. In public he plays an Uncle Tom style slave for his master, but behind the scenes hes wickedly sharp and even appears to be pulling the strings. All of these characters are aided by a terrific script, and I think that Tarantino's dialogue is benefited by the period setting, as it keeps his writing and characters focused on the story at hand.

The influences of the spaghetti westerns are obvious, with the frequent quick zooms, sweeping wide shots, and beautiful cinematography. The movie looks gorgeous, showcasing vast snowcapped mountain ranges in one scene and the desolate heat of the southern plantation in the next. As to be expected in a Tarantino movie, let alone a western, theres a ton of glorified violence in this. It's the kind of ridiculous, borderline cartoonish violence that can only suit the sensationalist take on the western genre. While the action scenes and bloody set pieces are well crafted and entertainingly shot, whats really nice to see is the use of blood packs. It might seem a minor detail, but in far too many action movies (especially in the past decade) there has been an abundance of CG blood spray. Its welcoming to see the old Robocop style gratuitous blood geysers that can only come from practical effects.

The violence is well over-the-top, but this plays into the blaxploitation aspect of the film along with the often contemporary selection of songs for the soundtrack, which reinforces the crazed and ridiculous take on the setting. All of the villains, who in this case are white slave owners, are depicted as disgusting, inhuman, sadistic degenerates who deserve everything thats coming to them by the inevitably gory end. Its actually a little refreshing to see the American slaver owner dehumanized in such a way, and it more than suits the tone of the film.

Django Unchained is hardly a movie that stresses some kind of deeper meaning or offers analysis on slavery and the morals behind it. It paints a very stark black and white picture for the sake of pure entertainment value. This is a movie meant to thrill and excite you, making every shot in every scene interesting and captivating without drawing too much attention to itself. Its the best kind of tribute to both of the genres there can be, and it could comfortably fit into a collection of either. Its pure bloody fun at its finest.",1397174400,,4861,4.929181929181929

5258815,4,B00947NAHU,"Eager for solid Tarantino fare after a few disappointments, some critics hailed this as his next ""masterpiece."" Could he possibly refresh his career to such a level? As a ""Pulp Fiction"" enthusiast raised on `60s cowboy fare, and having since gazed with wonder at the tradition it had revived, I was also eager to see what Tarantino could do in this genre.

Massive credits roll out over a panoramic Western landscape, as they used to since John Ford's days, cranking us for something very special. And whose music better to splash in with that than Ennio Morricone's, contributor extraordinaire in that great `60s revival, the spaghetti western? Homage to this tradition also surfaces through recognizable lines borrowed and twisted deftly from here and there, as well as through now-corny-looking zoom-ins. They're used with wit when we first meet DiCaprio, and when Jamie Foxx delivers someone a dirty look. At nearly 3 hours, this will be long, but still: get ready for something big. After all, Tarantino's likely to deliver the goods, what with his known respect, even reverence, for Hollywood classics, the top stars, and near-unlimited resources.

Still, for all the mentioned art direction, it soon appears that what's missing are the textures enriching classics like ""3:10 to Yuma"" or ""Shane"": unclean guys in scruffy clothes, badly shaven if at all, dogs crapping in streets with rain-puddles where they're not wanted, dirt clinging to everything. Authenticity, that is. Tarantino's known to shun realism to re-forge Hollywood, or even hyperbolic comic-books--but are these details the best-chosen, or are they less considered fare?

Unlike in Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven,"" to name a recent, well-turned western, art direction is no priority here: there's no rugged west. As when Don Johnson makes his entrance as a plantation owner, soon to sell some slaves to our pair of leads, one black (Foxx), one white (Christoph Waltz--who, incidentally, pretty much steals this show). Johnson steps out boldly onto a balcony, yet strikes the eye as having come straight from Costumes, and that he's ready for his close-up. No hint of a busy plantation master, worried perhaps about slumping prices or the coming crop, or drained by last night's romp in the slave stables.

So let's recognize this as entertainment: nothing here is documentary, realistic or revelatory. After all, no ante-bellum slave, male or female, would survive what these characters do in this story. The hero is out to rescue the slave-woman from his past, but though she's some kind of center of his universe and the motor of our plot, she underscores the lack of any strong female character. Despite scenes of her being mistreated, there is little to care about in her---or in anyone. Least of all Django, whose superpowers have him slither out of the unlikeliest scrapes, neither shaken nor stirred. He's also devoid of compassion, even toward the Australians who come to his aid, willing to help. Once given a weapon, he annihilates them because ...well, for no reason! Then he's off again, into the sunset on this puzzling quest.

Tarantino's hero is slick and articulate, the cleverest dude west of anywhere---although months before he was an unwashed slave, presumably lacking polish or skills away from the cotton fields. DiCaprio plays a curiously tolerant villain; after all, what southern slave-owner lets an ex-slave get lippy with him, let alone sit at his table? And when he dies, it's also sudden and no big whup. Ditto for Django's rescuer, the man who taught him all he knows about guns and nasty people---in short: be nastier. Even when this mentor bites it, it's pretty ho-hum. The Pygmalion angle between Django and his rescuer remains limp, while some may hope for more. Being a 21st century poseur, over-the-top comedy, a revisit or two to ""Cat Ballou"" might have served well.

Even in ""High Noon,"" where the dialogue was pared right down for the laconic Cooper, some effort was spent on character. Tarantino simply endows his hero with mythical status verging on farce, often visiting just that. Foxx emerges to a fanfare from clouds of dust, grinning with adda-tood, striking menacing poses in his new, badass duds. The retro camera-work affirms this as a romp, yet after the initial snickers it all becomes a bit tiresome. If you enjoy martial arts flicks, as Tarantino obviously does, you may find it fun to see heads (including one horse's) explode like cherry jello balloons, crimson sprays splattering the walls, or people extinguished by the half-dozen. But if you're eager to root for a cowboy who stands for the forces of goodness and niceness---well, maybe not.

If Tarantino's reaching for the low-life glories of ""Pulp Fiction,"" it's back to the drawing board. In that early outing, the hit-men's indifference to their victims had the upside of fresh, humorous, witty disregard during an earnest talk about hamburgers. The counterpart scene here involves the poor tailoring of masks for a raid, which ineptly blind the raiders. This results in some chuckles ...but only briefly. If he's out to recapture his mojo, this isn't it. The humor here is levity evoking James Garner (read: lite-) cowboy fare. Expect no gripping shoot-em-up where, as in Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto,"" you root heartily for someone. Be prepared instead for something closer to the fluffy ""Maverick.""

The unfolding of the seldom-predictable plot has its merits, and the acting is very far from third-rate. And it's no small achievement that this near-3-hour-long movie is actually watchable. Still, it's not likely to join the pantheon of western classics.

5258823,3,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino makes it very frustrating to be a real fan of his films.  There are moments of great scenes in DJANGO UNCHAINED, but they're all early on.

The rest is an overlong, over-indulgent exercise in overkill that eventually lost me.  INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (or however he mispells it) lost me almost immediately with its American atrocities and weird ""alternate history.""  DJANGO at least has a great start, some great photography, and a truly interesting character in the German bounty hunter.

But the movie goes on for far too long.  The violence is so over-the-top and ridiculous (like KILL BILL), I was knocked out of the movie.  I was also knocked out of the movie by the insertion of exploitation film music & sound effects from the 1970's.  I was also knocked out of the story by the addition of 1970's pop songs played in the 1800's wild west (I saw an interview with the world famous music composer from this film who vowed he'd never work with Tarantino again since ""he doesn't know what he's doing"" by seeking out modern exploitation music to put in a period Western piece).

I was genuinely offended by Jewish American soldiers gleefully committing horrific atrocities in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, made all the more obnoxious since Tarantino changed the real history so that, thank God, maybe most viewers won't think our troops behaved that way in WWII.  In DJANGO, the black fantasy of killing all white people was presented with as many broad strokes.

Tarantino has shown that he can be a great filmmaker...but there's a monstrous immature streak in his writing and directing that, sometimes, made me wish I was watching the orignal exploitation films he was making a parody of.",1395619200,5,1700,4.909090909090909

If you have a nice surround sound and proper viewing environment, you can really enjoy this movie on many different levels.  I'm not into spaghetti westerns (or any other kind, if there are) so I wasn't too thrilled about this moving coming to the house, but after watching it (repeatedly) I'm really glad my wife ordered it.

5258826,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantinos wickedly original farce Django Unchained does for slavery what his Inglorious Basterds did for World War II. Namely, it rewrites history as it SHOULD have been, not how it actually was. In Basterds, we got to see Hitler and his murderous minions taken out well ahead of schedule by a motley group of allied assassins. In Django, we get to see freed slave Django Freeman doing pretty much the same to just about every racist white villain unfortunate enough to cross his path.  In short, Django Unchained goes beyond mere historical revisionism to historical wish-fulfillment fantasy and helps to lay the foundation for a new genre in the process.

As Django Unchained opens, the title character is part of a group of chained slaves en route to auction. However, before they can get there, Django is freed by a loquacious, silver-tongued German man (played brilliantly by the scene-stealing Christoph Waltz) who is appalled by slavery and who asks Django to partner up with him as a bounty hunter. In addition to tracking down and killing wanted fugitives, the two make it their mission to rescue Djangos wife (Kerry Washington) from bondage to an infamous plantation owner, played by Leonardo DeCaprio in one of his finest performances to date.

Django actually began life as a character in a series of spaghetti westerns dating back to the mid 1960s and, indeed, Tarantino has included many spaghetti western tropes in his film, even though most of the movie takes place in the pre-bellum South. This Django is very loosely based on the earlier one, seeing as how the original, played by Franco Nero (who makes a cameo appearance in this film), was not a black slave but rather a white Union soldier.

Theres no denying the purgative effect of seeing Django delivering some frontier justice to all those slave owners and white oppressors who deserve everything they get at his hands. But Tarantino has never been one to see the world in black-and-white terms, nor as a simplistic conflict between evil and good. Theres a highly disturbing scene, for instance, where Django, determined not to blow his cover as a black slave trader, allows another slave to be mauled to death by dogs, a scene that shows Tarantino will even risk alienating Django from the audience if that means staying true to his vision. The director has clearly come to play, and he has no use for cleanly delineated lines between right and wrong, not when a persons very survival is at stake. The world he is showing us is simply too brutal, too unforgiving for such moral niceties to have much sway.

As an artist, Tarantino is clearly at the top of his game here, blending a host of seemingly contradictory elements into a seamless, eclectic whole. He mixes acerbic humor with hyper-stylized violence, and places flawless period piece detail against a soundtrack filled with contemporary songs, some already released and some written directly for the movie. Tarantino isn't afraid to linger long over his scenes, letting the audience savor every last juicy line of dialogue hes placed in the mouths of his characters. For the writing is always the best part of any Tarantino film, and he doesnt let us down here.

And thats probably why the actors seem to be having the time of their professional lives in this film. While  Jamie Foxx is taciturn and tight-lipped (as any hero - or antihero - of the West should be), Waltz, Di Caprio and Samuel L. Jackson, as the ultimate sycophantic house slave (often playing the Fool to DiCaprios Lear), go head-to-head in a no-holds-barred war of verbal gymnastics. The writing and performances are so much fun on their own, in fact, that Tarantinos dazzling visuals sometimes seem like just an unusually tasty dessert designed by the chef to top off the meal.

Tarantino clearly lives and breathes cinema, and thus he has populated his canvas with a vast array of familiar faces from movies and TV, past and present, some in very minor roles: Don Johnson, Walter Goggins, Russ and Amber Tamblyn, Bruce Dern, Don Stroud, Jonah Hill, James Parks, and Tarantino himself.

The filmmakers latest opus may not be for every viewer, but if you're looking for an iconoclastic work that has little regard for propriety and good taste and is not afraid to venture out into previously uncharted territory, then Django Unchained is the movie for you.",1395273600,,4368,4.883940620782726

5258858,3,B00947NAHU,"Christoph Waltz is a very good actor indeed, and Tarantino has exploited his abilities very well here. In my opinion, he makes this movie. I think Tarantino has become much more interested in framing his compositions--Robert Richardson has really outdone himself with these beautifully lit outdoor shots--and I love the 35 mm filming. Tarantino deserves praise for rejecting this cultural pull towards the digital age, because his movies usually end up looking like real movies at least (unlike these other travesties that have been coming out as of late). However, his writing is still not quite writing yet--he is still frankensteining a great deal of plot and dialogue and rewiring things that he loves instead of trying to invent too much. Sometimes, though, this half-assed approach works and sometimes it's enjoyable, admittedly, but I can't quite give it a high recommendation as a result. Tarantino is a master of style, however, and this is his best-looking film thus far. While not as hopelessly violent as (the stronger film) ""Inglorious Basterds"", there are hyperkinetic moments when the film merges outlandishly into ""splatter porn"" sequences which are way too stylized for my taste in judgment. However, on a better note, Tarantino's dialogue (while not all that original) is pretty amusing, and his patience has stretched a lot since the days of ""Reservoir Dogs"" in terms of developing watchable scenes. But, overall, I'm still waiting on the mature Tarantino to emerge--and he may one day.
The DVD is okay, with great picture and sound, and nothing extraordinary in terms of extras.

5258870,5,B00947NAHU,"This movie makes me chuckle a little inside. To say that Jamie ""Set black people back"" in this movie is ridiculous! Anyone who says that must prefer that blacks constantly be portrayed as strong but ignorant slaves constantly beaten by their ""massah."" Tarentino does an outstanding job of capturing the concept of slave ownership while also acknowledging that not all blacks were mindless drones.  In fact, he brings light to the fact that they probably just felt trapped in a system and there was no where for them to go without an education or paperwork. However, Django is acknowledged as the exceptional negro, and I agree with that; he was the man. Django's character represented strength, the ability to love, and the ability to progress intellectually. Also, I'm pretty sure that Django set a record for most whites killed by a black man in a movie, and if that sets us back a few years, then so be it. Keep it funny.",1392336000,,924,4.703703703703703

5258875,5,B00947NAHU,"This is my favorite movie for 2013. Another triumph from Quentin Tarantino, this one more in the vein of Inglorious Bastards than, say, Kill Bill. It is very well paced, extremely well acted, and feels so ""Tarantino"" that I find it hard to compare to anything not from him.

Like in Inglorious Bastards one of my favorite things about this movie is Christoph Waltz who completely steels every scene he is in. Also, I am not a big fan of Jamie Foxx in general but here he is brilliant (I am so glad that Will Smith turned down the role due to massive ego problems). Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson also do their usual great jobs.

If you haven't seen it already then watch it now, then watch it again :)",1391990400,,710,4.371212121212121

Jamie Foxx is outstanding as the unflinching and staunch Django who, beneath it all, is being led by his heart. Christoph Waltz is also riveting and a believable protagonist. And, of course, Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant as the Lord of the Plantation. The entire cast is composed of very talented actors, and makes this tale jump off the screen as if history is replaying itself before your very eyes. And, in Quentin Terantino style, the end is as explosive as the topic itself.",1390176000,,580,4.81

The movie was good, and I'm glad I watched it. But there were many parts I thought were a stretch and some parts didn't really seem necessary.

When the KKK-type guys were debating about whether or not to wear their bags covering their faces, I found it mildly amusing but it was out of place and dragged on too long. It's one thing to have the leader make a comment about it, but another to stop and have a 5-minute debate about it.

I found the logic for having to make up some big story about wanting to buy a fighter to be a stretch. If they thought just offering $200 wasn't enough to get a rich man's attention, why not just make a big enough offer like $3,000? If Mr Candy-land is willing to take in guests, board and treat them to nice dinners, and let them boss around his slaves for a few days on the expectation of $12,000, surely he'd be willing to make a quick 5 minute deal for $3,000. Yeah I know, then we wouldn't have half the movie.

Christoph Waltz , Jamie Fox , Kerry Washington, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson were amazing  .

Jamie Foxx was a little disappointing-- due to his vernacular and speech delivery and the actress who played the sister of Misuer Candi could've been someone better, but besides that the movie was perfection-- especially DiCaprio's depiction of Misuer Candi, Christoph Waltz's depiction of the doctor and Samuel Jackson's Uncle Tom ass performances were brilliant!!!

5258976,5,B00947NAHU,"Django is to African Americans as Inglorious Basterds is to Jews.  They both represent unmitigated and violent retribution.  They're also how I imagine both groups want on a primal level - for the oppressor to feel the pain of oppression - a desire for comprehension.  What must be kept in mind is this comprehension extends to all racial and religious groups, including African Americans and Jews.  Both movies serve as an outlet because in reality most members of those groups took the high road immediately after the periods of oppression.  Tarantino's use of language is as abrasive as the graphic violence.  I know there is controversy around the use of the ""N"" word within the script; however, given the time period of the movie I believe it helps underscore the pure hatred and contempt slave owners had for their ""subhuman"" assets.  By the end of the movie you're salivating at the thought of Django fulfilling his vow of revenge.  Most importantly Tarantino reminds us (in an in-your-face style not easily ignored) that his violence is not exaggerated, no matter how bad he makes it out to be the reality was much worse.",1388016000,,1129,4.84375

5258978,1,B00947NAHU,"Okay, if you are in to ""wanton slaughter"" like a spaghetti western only showing the blood and gore, this is the movie for you.  I generally like Quintin Tarantino movies but this one was a bit much, and the storyline was far from believeable (one black slave takes on and kills a whole plantation of whites with a gun that never runs out of bullets - sounds like a John Rambo story). This movie had scenes that bear strong similarities to a movie called The Raid - Redemption where a hundred shooters fire from a balcony on one person and never hit, but he shoots them all, every time. If you were my next door neighbor, I would give you this DVD for free and say ""take it; I don't ever plan to watch it again"".  In all fairness, there was some excellent characterizations by Christopher Waltz as a ruthless bounty hunter, Samuel L. Jackson as a faithful slave butler, and Leonardo DiCaprio as a plantation owner.",1387929600,8,913,4.461077844311378

5258991,5,B00947NAHU,Before watching Django Unchained I had heard that it had a lot of foul language that made the movie unfit to watch. I say baloney! It does have some bad words sprinkled throughout but the movie its self more than makes up for them. Jamie Fox puts on the acting experience of his life as a slave that is hell bent on finding his woman that had been sold away from him. Django Unchained  keeps you hanging on to end as he finds his woman and metes out the punishment to the scoundrels who had her. A really good movie that deserves more praise than it received.,1387238400,,559,4.224299065420561
5258992,4,B00947NAHU,"I would have given it five stars but the violence and blood was just a little over the top for me.  The acting superb.  My daughter did not even recognize Samuel Jackson in the movie until she really listened to his voice.  Jamie Foxx used his own horse in the film and rode it well.  The opening scene with the slaves walking barefoot in the cold.  That is the account you get when reading slave narratives and from historians.  Even the mouth pieces and various forms of punishment including the box.  So despite the blood, and say they use the ""n"" word to the nth time.  But again maybe over the top, but that is how slaves were talked to.  I think it should have gotten better recognition because it was a good film, superb acting all the way around from Jamie, Kerry, Samuel, Christopher and Leonardo.

5259003,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino has done it again.  Great film, great acting, great dialogue, great plot.  Would you expect anything else for Tarantino?  Christoph Waltz steals the show as a bounty hunter who collects rewards for killing outlaws.  The relationship him and Django (Foxx) develop throughout the film is wonderful.  The main point of the movie is to find Django's wife who has been assigned to Candie land, a plantation that Calvin Candie owns, played by DiCaprio.  The dinner scene where Candie finds out Waltz and Django have been lying to him, thanks to Candie's Uncle Tom, played my Samuel L. Jackson, is a tense scene.  Django winds up having to suffer some consequences but gets his revenge in the most explosive way possible.  All in all this is a great film and I think it gets better upon repeated viewings",1386547200,,815,4.81294964028777

5259014,5,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained in my humble opinion is the best Quentin Tarantino movie he has ever dreamed up, and there have been some great ones in the past.  This movie features Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, and a great performance by Samuel L. Jackson.  The movie is deceptive from what you see from the trailers.  Django Unchained looks like your run of the mill revenge film, which it is, but its more.  This movie is also about friendship (Foxx and Wentz) and lost love (Foxx and Washington).

The movie features an outstanding soundtrack and the literary language used in the film is perfect.  The supporting cast is great as well, which is to be expected from a Tarantino movie.  I actually paused this review to watch a little of the movie while writing this review, this is how much I like the movie.

I feel a bit guilty liking it as much as I do. But, as usual, Tarantino takes what could have been a B-rated gory screenplay and turns it into a work of cinematic art. I'm not sure how he keeps getting oscar-level performances from his actors, but he does in film after film.",1385510400,,606,4.726415094339623

5259020,1,B00947NAHU,Cheap and juvenile storyline. Tarintino thinks he's clever but he's not. You can't relate to any of the characters because they are all so implausible. Like an dumb SNL skit that never ends. Don't waste your time and money.,1385251200,10,223,4.743589743589744

Turns out that this is one of the best Quentin Tarentino has done. The film's humor is twisted, demented and timeless. Sometimes in your face. Other times subtle. The film addresses important issues but is pure entertainment. It will spark conversations afterwards and make you go back to watch again and see what you may have missed. Excellent, rich character performances from talented actors abound. Delicious period accents. Gorgeous costumes. Why did I wait so long?? Just see it!!",1384819200,,647,4.944954128440367

5259037,5,B00947NAHU,"This was definitely one of last year's best films.  I really expected it to do better at the Oscars.  I did have qualms before I showed it to my movie group thinking that being from Tarantino, it might be too violent for a bunch of ladies over age 65, but it was well received.",1384473600,,277,4.111111111111111
5259038,5,B00947NAHU,Django is easily one of Quentin Tarantino's best! Bloody violence and a great story about the redemption of a slave and his vengeance on the cruelty of slave owners. The film brought gun-slinging to a whole new realm!,1384387200,,217,4.7368421052631575

5259044,3,B00947NAHU,Kind of disappointed. Feels more like a series of events rather than a cohesive whole like the best of Tarantino films. Don't really understand what's great about Waltz in this one (I did understand the Inglourious Basterds hype). To me Samuel L Jackson deserved the supporting actor nomination (or win).

I expect a movie to entertain me for a couple hours - maybe even WOW !! me a couple times - leave me with the movie for a couple hours when it's over. And, that's all and much more, what this movie did for me. Suspense = plenty = you somehow know with every new scene / little story in the big story, that this might not end well, while everybody is still smiling and trying to play along, ... you know as soon as there is an opportunity for someone in the movie to get violent / bring on justice, it well get done - always with a somehow satisfying outcome which you will never really predict. Sure, it's bloody / maybe even gory - but it's ""holly smokes, hahaha / funny / over the top gory"" and never ""OMG, I don't want to see that - type of gory"" ... it's a great movie - and I didn't realize that it was 3 hours long. ...

I decided to dedicate my rating toward the movie itself, but as far as Instant goes: It's not a bad service, by any means, and I'd be happy to chuck more money Amazon's way, but I didn't realize the copy would have DRM locking it down.

I was thinking from all the hype that it was a film more about the reality of slavery in this country (which, admittedly, it did touch on) and less about the hollywood love story complete with beautiful/handsome leading lady/man. Just not what I was looking for amidst the gore (whew! that was a LOT of overdone blood spurting and gore gathering! I was not squeamish but kinda amused . . . too much). Great acting by some.

They gave you a character to love/hate. It was a twisted role and story line that actually worked. The special effects were a little clumsy, but not bad. The ending was good, but the period of show that created the ending was the best. I hated to see a favored character exit, but what an exit he made. Perfect. I would recommend.

It was a fun story from a vengeance and violence standpoint that showed some of my favorite actors doing outrageous things.  Like many of Quentins stories it isn't the blood and gore that brings you to the theater, it is the interchange between the characters before/after they have pulled the trigger.  The conversations between the explosions, gun shots, whipping and outlandish plans ring true and make you that much more excited for the scenes where bullets fly.

5259108,1,B00947NAHU,"Note to Tarantino----A spoof is supposed to be funny. See Spinal Tap to learn how to film a spoof.

I am not a fan of Tarantino although I enjoyed Jackie Brown very much. I have tried to watch Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, etc., but find this director largely tedious, perpetually stuck in adolescence, and vastly overrated.

I sat through three-quarters of Django, a truly silly movie, because a relative brought it from the library and I was curious. As another reviewer said, the exploding ketchup pack theme has been overdone. After an hour or so of resting our minds, we half-heartedly turned the film back on and watched it to the ludicrous end.

Tarantino must be informed immediately that film is a visual medium and having DiCaprio, a meager talent at best, sit at a table with other actors and blabber on and on for over 30 minutes is simply not interesting. There was way too much dialogue in this film and a mediocre script to boot. Django needed a script doctor badly as it was about 45 minutes too long.

Tarantino should be banned from attempting to act in his films. In this one he attempted an Australian accent, wore clothes and hat that looked like they had just come out of a dry cleaner, and had too much flesh on him to be believable in 1858. By the way, the Civil War started in 1861, not 1860. Can't anybody on his staff do any research?

I also agree with other reviewers who were critical of rap music being used as background and dialogue containing slang that no one had heard of in this country until after 2000.

Hide all of the cameras so he can't do any more harm to American culture. Let this be the Last Django in Hollywood.",1381017600,16,1656,4.448844884488449

5259124,5,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained is almost three hours long but it flew by. What a great movie! Full disclosure: I'm a 57 year old baseball mom whose husband and two sons love Quentin Tarantino, but his movies always made me scratch my head, cover my eyes, and eventually just leave the room. Not ""Django Unchained."" I love Westerns, I love Jamie Foxx, I love movies about justice and might for right, I hate racism and the abomination that was slavery...this movie has all of that and much, much more.

For women (and men) who might be afraid of the violence...there is a lot, but I covered my eyes in a few places, and when blood spurts, it is often almost cartoonish, geyser gusher spurts of ketchup-red liquid like from a fountain, and sometimes when people get shot, they get jerked up and back, almost like a Peter Pan type harness is on them. It's not pretty, but it is campy, not realism like in ""Saving Private Ryan."" The worst violence in the movie is the most realistic kind: when slaves are beaten and abused, that is hard to watch. As it should be.

If you like Tarantino and you hate white people -- probably because you're not that bright and you think what you see on liberal TV is real -- you'll like it.  The acting is decent and on par with the rest of his movies.  However, if the races were reversed, it would be banned as a hate film.  Just awful.  In a country where whites are constantly victimized by violent interracial crime, it's perversely irresponsible to make a movie promoting violence against whites and pathetic that Amazon sells this hateful trash.  Jamie Foxx is also a bigot who joked about how great it was to kill whites in a movie.  Just a shame.

5259149,4,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained (the 'D' is silent), is a fun action film. THe film is a bit slowly paced, yet made sure to ensure that the film was still engaging and kept the action moving. I felt it was a bit long winded (2 hours 45 minutes) for my taste, and I felt it could have been sped up a bit without losing anything. The overall plot is simple, Django get's separated from his wife, and this is the story of him trying to rescue her (that's all I can say without ruining anything). While the film focuses heavily on the main characters, Tarentino does a fantastic job of making the story interesting by using secondary characters to his advantage. This adds a lot to the film and makes the film come to life. The movie though isn't as violence focused as some others by him such as Kill Bill (don't worry, there is still plenty of violence), but really takes advantage of humor to make this a bit more light hearted at times. It's important to remember though that this is a fictional movie. There are historical inaccuracies, etc. and this is fine as long as you can look past that.

Parents, this is not for kids. There is a little nudity, some innuendos, lots of violence, blood, and gore, use of the ""N"" word, concepts such as slavery, alcohol consumption etc. For this reason I'd peg it at 15-18 years old. This obviously will vary depending on the family.

Overall, the audio itself is not the best I've heard with it's DTS HD-MA 5.1 soundtrack. The film's vocals are slightly low on the volume end. The dynamics aren't there and it's a bit of a flat soundtrack. The highs and lows don't occur often. It does have a few dynamic peaks, the surrounds are used pretty well to create a nice, encompassing environment.

The video was good, a bit cold considering the desert and warm environments the characters were in. The blood and shadows were detailed and the shadows had a fantastic detail level with the grime and textures. The film is a bit soft, not as sharp as I would have liked at times but still well detailed. I believe this is an artistic choice, but one that bothered me at times.

Overall I'd recommend it, but it was a bit longer than I would have liked. The characters were well developed and had some good humor at times. If you have the time, go for it, but if you can't stand a long and often violent movie, I would recommend passing on this.",1379376000,2,2360,4.405963302752293

The subject matter is far too serious to be made into what I viewed as a parody of Eastwood westerns. Like Clint, Foxx was larger than life and could out gun dozens of men in any given situation. For me this was a distraction to any serious point the writer may have been attempting to deliver.

QT goes well over the top with the gore.

The music is terrible and out of place. The subject matter is as dark as it gets, yet the music is corny and better suited for a comedy.

Overall the film has too many silly items for me to take serious. Just to name a few we have silly music, a guy driving a wagon with a tooth attached, and a female slave named Broomhilda",1379030400,,714,4.078571428571428

Slavery and it's evils is a subject that is avoided in this country. It is a subject that has to be confronted because to understand this country and it's culture, slavery has to be understood.

5259168,5,B00947NAHU,"I've always mistrusted the American devotion to redemption through retributive violence.

I don't believe that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is to have a good guy with a gun take him out in slow mo.

Then I see the ultimate example of the salvific effects of bloodshed. Two hundred years of torture and rape eradicated by one badass black gunfighter.

Django Unchained pits a man who has always been a slave and his only friend, an immigrant outsider, against the institution, slavery, that gave Thomas Jefferson the leisure to write ""All men are created equal..."" Slavery made ""Liberty"" possible. Django doesn't just shoot down his wife's tormenters, he blows up the American Enlightenment.

Slavery and the violence against non-whites that it required are so essential to the character of our country that their residue can still be smelled whenever Birther fulminations against a ""Kenyan President"" are heard. I grew up at a time when white people believed they had the right to beat blacks with clubs if they tried to vote. In our time, when a recent poll shows that a majority of my white fellow Americans hold racist views of blacks, I know that this is good as it has ever been for African Americans. Black kids grow up assured that even if they grow up to be president, half of all whites will still not consider them part of the ""Real America.""

Django, the slave freed by a German Liberal, is the Siegfried, or Freeman, of the Gtterdmmerung of slavery's gods in this movie. His rescue of his wife, Brnnhilde, is incidental to his role as the man who brings down the old white gods who had the power to order the destruction of the bodies of their black slaves. The twilight of these idols comes with the splatter and explosions you'd expect from a Tarantino film, but throws the post-Civil War radical's quandary into sharp relief. Without the inhumane slaughter of those whose violence kept blacks in chains, freedom would always be jealously assailed by whites dispossessed of their fortunes in human flesh. Django and his wife can only escape to freedom if those who enslaved them cannot follow them from the grave.",1378944000,2,2140,4.741935483870968

Along the way, a lot of gory bloodshed appeared and the trail led to the Candy Man, and playing his best slave, Samuel Jackson, who, I must admit, played the living hell outta this character.

I read every support related article, and saw that I could stream it to the Amazon App on my PS 3. I installed the Amazon App, and was asked to sign in. I don't have Prime, so I signed in using my Amazon user name and password. After watching the circular ""PS3 I'm busy"" icon, the App was installed. Great, yeee haaaa, I can watch it, but nooooooo. I was prompted to enter a 5 digit PIN number. Since my kid gave it to me for Xmas, I didn't have a PIN. I finally (after 15 minutes), received on-line help.

Jamie Fox was of course brilliant and as amazing as he always is. - powerful and intensely charming actor. In fact, with the exception of the young object of Jamie Fox's affection, each character was wonderful, well performed, emotionally stimulating and so on.  The young love of Jamie Fox appeared to be a beautiful slave princess:  not at all convincing - certainly not in the context of the era.  She was a little too unafraid; her mannerism too cocky...too bad.  And last, but not least, the music, other than Richie Haven's freedom was horribly used.  The selection of music abolished the possibility of any strong emotion toward the any of the events.  it could have been a powerful movie, but Mr. Tarantino went overboard with his artistic licensee..",1378252800,5,892,4.828947368421052

Everything was cool and hip; Foxx and DiCaprio were stellar in their performances, but the supporting actor, Christopher Waltz pretty much stole the show.

This is a hard hitting movie about the depravities of power and arrogance during slavery's heyday.

The only downside is that you might have a hard time living with yourself after you've watched a portrayal of slavery at its worst...at least I hope it's the worst. You can't help but like the two main characters, and hate the primary villain,but after the movie I began to wonder how evil some plantation owners might have been.

5259236,5,B00947NAHU,"Why it took me so long to see this movie is beyond me. I wanted to catch it in theaters but just never got around to it. This movie was great from start to finish, and the acting was superb. So if you haven't seen this movie yet or just want to add to your collection I highly recommend this movie, so long as your older then 18 of course.  ;-)",1377734400,,344,3.8450704225352115
5259237,5,B00947NAHU,"This is Tarantino at his best. You get exactly what you expect - and so much more. There's the action, blood & guts, a little love mixed in, lots of violence, and of course the classic Tarantino humor. I was hesitant at first because it seemed a little dark, but man-oh-man it was SOOO worth it. I'm actually going to have to purchase this one because it's one you need. The story was excellent, the acting was phenomenal,etc, etc, etc. I can't speak highly enough of this. If you can stomach Tarantino, then you'll love Django Unchained.",1377648000,,538,4.556701030927835
5259238,5,B00947NAHU,"If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino, you'll love this movie.  If he's a bit too violent for you, you still might like this one.  This is more light-hearted and fun than most of his movies.  The real reason I wanted to buy this movie was for the lovable, supporting character, Dr. Shultz.  His character is so well-written, and funny, he makes this movie!  Of course, Quentin Tarantino can't let the movie stay happy and fun throughout.  Some of the more violent scenes are gruesome, and incredibly sad.  But overall, this movie is definitely worth watching.",1377648000,,558,4.75

I enjoy his movies because they break away from the cookie cutter Hollywood conveyor belt of drivel they are tossing out nowadays. taking notes from Sergio Leone's old school westerns. That I also enjoy, this is a great show I have enjoyed watching again and again. 2 thumbs up.",1377648000,,351,4.866666666666666

5259245,4,B00947NAHU,"I really liked Django. It had some very funny parts to it and there was a lot of action. But this is my kind of movie. I'm not comparing it to a Tom Hanks movie or something a little more mainstream. Tarantino's movies are pretty violent and grotesque. This one was as well. The jokes are a bit raw.

5259251,4,B00947NAHU,Character development not so good.  A little history behind the majors missing.  Story line somewhat plausible.  I would have ended it a little different.  Sam Jackson character conversion maybe or taking over the household for the betterment.  Oh well...,1377475200,,255,5.435897435897436

5259276,4,B00947NAHU,"Dealing with the slave trade automatically signals that its likely to be gritty and it is. However comic relief is present and Jaime Foxx is really good. Great flick very much in the same vain as Pulp Fiction. Just remember Tarentino likes to make you uncomfortable, in a good way.",1376956800,,281,4.64

5259281,5,B00947NAHU,"I'm not a huge fan of Quentin Trantino, but this film was good. I have to say, without Jamie Foxx, this movie would have tanked hard. Jamie made this film what it was and he was awesome in the movie. I really think he was the shining force that led to the success of this movie. Like I said with Tarantino, I'm not a fan. But I loved this Film!!",1376956800,,345,3.942857142857143

If you are unfamiliar with Tarantino's work, be prepared for a distinct style with a good deal of gore. Some would call it gratuitous, others artful and stylistic. I did enjoy this movie. It caused me to laugh until I cried as well as to cringe in horror. Know what you are getting into before watching the film, and you might like it as well as I did.",1376870400,,497,4.134020618556701

Anachronisms abound -almost as bad as the contrails of a jet showing up in the John Wayne/Kirk Douglas film The War Wagon.  The best part of any Leonardo DiCaprio film is when his character dies - hopefully horribly.  Jamie Foxx must have really needed a paycheck to stoop this low.  Blight 'em. Cowboy!

5259295,4,B00947NAHU,Quentin began his revisionist historical accounts with Inglourious Basterds and continues with this look at a black bounty hunter who wants to be reunited with his still-a-slave wife.  The acting alone is worth the price of admission.  This film made me think and that is icing on the cake.,1376611200,,290,4.8979591836734695

5259297,4,B00947NAHU,"This was a great movie, definitely worth watching. Out of the Quentin Tarantino films, I would say it's one of my favorites, along with Inglourious Basterds.

However, my one complaint is not with the movie, but rather with the delivery: Amazon Instant Video. Unfortunately, the dialog volume was a little too low when I watched it using the Amazon Instant Video app on my Samsung Smart TV (2012 model). This made it hard to hear the dialog unless I cranked up the volume really high. The problem with that was that when there were loud tracks (music, certain sound effects, etc.) it became too loud. I spent the entire moving frequently raising and lowering the volume.",1376524800,,670,4.775862068965517

5259299,5,B00947NAHU,"Personally I am always skeptical with Quentin Tarantino films (I either completely love them or despise them). Luckily, I completely loved Django Unchained. It's comedy, drama, action/adventure, all rolled up into one amazing movie. Basically, you'll laugh, cry, and cheer before it's all said and done, and I could not have enjoyed it more. Best line ever: ""I like the way you die, boy."" Classic.",1376524800,,397,5.123076923076923

5259309,5,B00947NAHU,"While this movie is not for the soft viewer it carries a realistic story in history. Being able to capture a time , place and sad history of our country it allows us to try to imagine how things were. We have obviously have come a long way. But could be seen as an  over the top display of entertainment. It being a show of negative, hate , goodwill and drive of men black & white. It also shows an opposite practice of  black males abandoning their women and family. This movie illustrates different. A black man stopping at nothing to get his love back while dealing all kinds of obstacles. Good watching lots of adult situations and I do recommend. Try and watch it without closing your eyes or disputing it. Watch, think about it it, you too may see many interesting acts of human and inhumane behaviors that all men and women can appreciate that is captured in a movie.",1376352000,,874,4.388888888888889

Put that together with your typical Hollywood super badass who kills hundreds of well armed opponently who magically forgot how to shoot at all and a six gun that shoots 10 rounds before running out in convinient moments for the story and the 2:45 minute runtime got a little tedious at times.

Leo DiCaprio was a standout in this as I expected more of a cameo type role. He was deliciously depraved in that very inbred southern way. Jamie Fox was amazing as was his mentor Christoph Waltz. Their dialogue was fascinating; they were a perfect fit. I appreciate the way slavery was depicted in its entirety as the inhumane practice it was and continues to be in many countries. I never felt that it was made light of but was used to tell the story of two people who just wanted to be together and one dear man who could not wrap his mind around the concept of people owning other people and the way in which these people were treated. Quentin Tarantino may be a genius in his ability to tell a story and his ability to keep me on the edge of my seat because I have miraculously become a part of the tableau.

5259326,3,B00947NAHU,"Tarantino does love film. And he knows how to direct. He has a couple instant classics in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. I much enjoyed Inglorious Bastards but I think I am getting the hint here. He is just looking to have fun in an old Hollywood style way. His style is starting to become a caricature of what it was before in some minor ways though. I like elements of the adventurous spirit and despise some of the bloated nature of the style. For every great scene in Django there are others that make you wish there was more to the story. More realism and more drama instead of wholesale 'entertainment'. It is what it is.

The script is wild and playful and the period details are mostly decent though everything is still too damn clean for my liking. There is some symbolism and expert direction going on for sure. Samuel Jackson kind of steals the show in many scenes and the film is worth watching just for his performance alone. But towards the end I grew sick of the movie time violence and casual interplay between events and actors. I don't mean to sound like there is no message here but the film is clearly in the vein of the over-the-top style his films are becoming more and more accustomed to using. I lean towards a 3.5 here for a 7/10. Rent it or own it but it's a decent flick.",1376179200,4,1300,4.349794238683128

Combining everything you already know and love about QT films - strategically placed humor, gore, great actors in unexpected roles - perfectly with his recent appreciation of adapted history, makes this the best movie I've seen this year.
While the movie (like most of his others) is NOT historically accurate, it hardly matters with characters this complex and diverse.
QT's signature blas conversations slipped into the script worked really well for Django, allowing the audience some disturbing insight on the thought-processes of slavers.
That being said, like Inglourious Basterds, this movie won't be for everyone. There is a ton of brutality, offensive language and things we'd prefer to remember didn't actually happen 150 odd years ago.
Even though there are enough historical questions marks for pretentious film snobs to turn their nose up at it, Django manages to invoke strong empathy for it's characters, and sheds light on different aspects of a time we'll never know.
Great casting and brilliant performances from all involved - even Jonah Hill surprised me on this one.

5259369,4,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained Bowling for Movies Score: 265.406 of 300

Before I get started, a word:
When I was fresh out of high school and attending junior college I started dating a bright, beautiful, entertaining lady body builder.  Her name is lost to time but one fine day she looked at me and said, ""Obstacles are what you see when you lose sight of your goals.""  She then picked me up in fireman's carry, spun me around, and threw me into a wood fence.  Alas, our love was not meant to be but what she said stuck.  Obstacles truly are what you see when you lose sight of your goals and if you read enough of the reviews (which I did) or even the professional movie critics you'll find plenty of obstacles to lose sight with.  All the controversy this movie generated really doesn't have much to do with the movie itself.  After careful consideration I made a movie dude decision to not even really touch on any of them.  Controversy is courted by Hollywood because it generates interest, interest generates ticket sales, and ticket sales are what make the world go round.  Ok, I feel better now and I think I can give a good overview of the film :]

We own the Blu Ray, DVD, Digital Copy version of this movie

Most movies score in the 120-160 range, those would be your average run of the mile movies.  If a film breaks 200 it's really something special.  The bowling for movies rating system works just like a bowling match with this one exception - it has literally nothing to do with bowling but does utilize a quasi-pseudo-science and a healthy dose of grape jelly, electric fences, and common household blenders.  Movies go in one side and a comprehensive score comes out the other.

What I liked:
1.  If a 70's spaghetti-western hooked up with a 70's exploitation film, Django would be their love child... and I LOVE spaghetti-westerns and exploitation films (just lucky I guess).
2.  Christoph Waltz gives a career defining performance as the dentist turned bounty hunter and slave free-er dude (a well deserved Academy Award)
3.  Frankly, I never really cared much for Jamie Foxx - I mean as good as Booty Call was - he just never gave an inspired performance (or maybe I just never saw one), until now.  WOW, did his stock go up with me.
4.  Over the top wit, action, and blood (it's a Tarantino movie after all and he never lets you forget)
5.  Django has a WONDERFUL soundtrack, perfectly married to the on-screen action, feeling, and emotions

What I didn't like:
1.  Stephen, the house slave - Samuel Jackson's performance was so convincing I was utterly disgusted and felt sick watching this repulsive character
2.  The story goes off the rails a bit and stretches credibility... hey man, it's only a movie, I get it but even I had to cringe at some of the plot twists which defied reality and logic.  A forgivable sin all things considered but a sin none-the-less
3.  All the ""obstacles"" which keep people from seeing this movie over ridiculous concerns about certain non-PC terms, fictitious story-related brutality, and other tomfoolery surrounding the movie - it taints what otherwise is a very good film.
4.  Leonardo DiCaprio... oh, he did a great job playing the vicious, cruel, repugnant owner of Candyland - a southern plantation, I just really don't like Leonardo.

First of all, consider the time here. we had no control of that. slavery was the order of the day and it wasn't like they were being cordial and kind calling us negroes. They was cordial if they said ""negra"" out their mouth. so to me, I'm not tripping on that. Jamie Foxx,from the time he shook that blanket off him in the first scene and took over, I loved Django. he was my hero. I loved the way he used a gun. how he was hellbent and determined to get his wife broomHilda back even though it was dangerous for ALL involved. I never forgot Schultz(Christopher Walz in his sidekick award winning role)warn him that Mississippi was no place for any man,neither free or slave. never forgot it. Leonardo DiCaprio made me despise him totally. no love for Mr/Monsiour Candie whatsoever or his funky,evertrusting slave flunky Samuel Jackson either. matter of fact, no one would have been the wiser if Jackson's character told the deal from the start.but they didn't count on Django doing what he did either, and really couldn't feel sorry for them at the end of the film. great film. wasn't crazy for the bloodshed,cussing. the KKK scene was hysterical. it got so, there was a girl at work who had the whole scene down pat too and could imitate it. boy we would fall out each and every time.",1375574400,,1569,4.304054054054054

5259415,1,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained is not just problematic in terms of its filmmaking, but in regards to its very existence.

For starters, Quentin Tarantino has made a pop culture-soaked Hollywood blockbuster about slavery, and he's earned an enormous amount of money by doing so. That seems a bit flippant to me, but the real killer is the film's hackneyed and one-dimensional approach to its subject matter and characters. Tarantino seems content to do nothing more ambitious with his film than preach about the sins of rich, white, slave owners. Considering the type of movie Django Unchained is, this last part strikes me as insincere and perhaps even fraudulent, and it makes the entire film feel like an effort to cash in on people's sympathetic gut reactions. To put it in other words: Quentin Tarantino is a rich white man who has exploited the history of American slavery for millions of dollars in personal profit by pandering to an audience's distaste of rich white men who exploited black slaves for personal gain.

Hmm....

But let's set aside the film's context for a moment and dig into the content a bit more. The next question is: is this a good film on its own terms?

Well, Django Unchained is long. Three hours long. It is reasonably possible for a movie to stay entertaining for that amount of time, but Django Unchained is bloated with long moments spent hammering away on the same trying themes. For example, there are numerous scenes in the movie where a character is shocked to see a black man on a horse. Several discussions are even had about it. Once or twice is enough to get the point across, but revisiting it every few moments over the course of 180 minutes is not just dull, it's insulting.

Unfortunately, the horse scenes are representative of the entire film. Tarantino has not given his viewers the slightest room to think for themselves or interpret the film on their own terms. Every idea is so bare and free of nuance that a child could understand it, yet Tarantino bludgeons away as though he is introducing a perception of American racial discrimination to the world for the first time. ""Racism is bad, and all people are equal"" is the easy message here. This is one of the most disheartening aspects of the film, as the simplicity and heavy-handedness of Tarantino's storytelling is unlikely to change the mind of anyone who isn't already over the fence. Even worse, the film manages to present a main character that contradicts its own message of acceptance.

Django is about as one-dimensional as any character I've ever seen in a film. He is not only devoid of personality and charisma, but he fails to offer any personal insights or opinions of his own. Instead, he is driven solely by revenge and, as the film trailer so proudly advertises, a desire to kill white people. Which effectively takes the sincerity of Tarantino's anti-racism message, wads it up, and throws it right out the window. The rest of the cast is similarly flat, and even Christoph Waltz's fine performance cannot save his character from falling into tiresome predictability two minutes after he appears onscreen.

It is also worth mentioning the violence in the film. The blood is tinted orange and looks like it is being sprayed from a garden hose. Tarantino's embrace of his reputation as a dark and edgy filmmaker has left the violence without a shred of the subtlety or believability needed to make it effective, which places it in the same disappointing space as every other aspect of the film.

Tedious, dull, and in desperate need of an editor, Django Unchained is an atrocious piece of filmmaking that disregards the intelligence of its audience while preaching a message that is not represented by the filmmaker, the story, or the title character.",1375056000,34,3759,4.8351477449455675

The severity of hatred and fear, which perpetuates the notion that one race is more superior than the other.

5259453,2,B00947NAHU,"I tend to either really like Tarantino movies, or really dislike them.

This was a dislike for a few reasons:

The plot, as simple as it was, didn't make enough sense.  There is a ""scam"" going on that amounts to ""you wouldn't sell me your object unless I paid you too much for it, so I'll try to buy another object from you . .  .for too much. . .then hope you throw in the first object . . .or something.""  They didn't convey the reason why the main characters were going thru all the trouble.  but I could have overlooked something, so this is more of a pet peeve - something I'd look closer at if I ever watched it again.

Jamie Fox  -the title character - ends up being (at best) the 4th most interesting main character.  His wife in the movie ranks somewhere after ""key grip"".  So it's hard to care what they do or what happens to them.  This is the biggest flaw in the movie.

The N word was a unneeded distraction.  I see no use for it in this movie. Bad, bad decision there.

Tarantino's cameo.  Ugh.  Blurg.  The vomit in my mouth tastes repulsive, just like his fake accent in the cameo.

2nd half of movie not nearly as interesting as first half.

A list of Pros, but these don't save the movie: The German guy, who was in his last movie about the Nazis. He was great for the first 1/2 the movie.  But what should have been the most tense scenes (putting him on the flipside of his best scene /the first scene in Inglourious Basterds) ends up falling flat, and he's inconsequential for the rest of the movie.  Tarantino KNEW how to make that scene tense, and that should have been the emotional high point of the movie, but instead it went nowhere, and the movie went downhill from there.  It was 3 stars before this point, 1 star after.

It's an unconventional western, and I like westerns.  The soundtrack was a mix of old and new songs, and I'll give it a plus.  The old ones sort of placed it into the past, which was good for a western.  If I was making a western movie (ha!) I would totally copy this idea and have all the music be 50+ years old. It somehow places you into another time, although of course not the right time, but the important thing is that it takes you out of the present.",1374624000,2,2208,4.197619047619048

5259457,3,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino, in his latest effort to make a movie about movies, has crossed the spaghetti Western with blaxploitation and come up with ""Django Unchained"". In ante-bellum Texas, German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) attempts with much fanfare to purchase a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He needs Django's help in identifying a pair of outlaw brothers that he intends to kill for the reward and will give Django his freedom in return. Django proves to be a talented apprentice bounty hunter, and he intends to employ those skills in tracking down his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) once winter has passed. Broomhilda was sold to Calvin Candie (Leonardo Dicaprio), a sadistic bon vivant who owns the biggest cotton plantation in Mississippi. Schultz comes up with a risky plan to coax Candie into giving Broomhilda up.

The films that inspired ""Django Unchained"" are, specifically, Sergio Corbucci's 1966 spaghetti Western ""Django"" and the 1975 blaxploitation flick ""Boss N**ger"" starring and written by Fred Williamson, which also takes place in the 19th century. ""Django Unchained"" was not intended to be historically accurate. ""Mandingo"" fights, which are a kind of slave cock-fight as portrayed in the movie, did not exist. The characters are all eccentric, and the violence, borrowed from fairly bloodthirsty genres, is intended to entertain. The soundtrack is rock'n'roll. The film has a linear narrative, unlike many of Tarantino's movies. And it feels much too long at 2 hours and 45 minutes. It goes way beyond the point of tediousness for what is essentially an action-comedy.

Tarantino's signature pop culture banter fares poorly in a period piece. There are no cultural references that would both make sense in context and be understood by modern audiences. The dialogue is not as clever as we've come to expect from Tarantino, nor the characters interesting. Our black hero, Django, blows away a lot of white people, but it doesn't have the same significance as in blaxploitation. Blaxploitaiton films played an important economic role for black talent in Hollywood in the 1970s, and they tended to address social issues relevant to black urban communities. They didn't just kill white people. The bad guys were just as often black. The racial violence in ""Django Unchained"" is more distasteful than meaningful. If Tarantino is trying to comment on blaxploitaiton films themselves, rather than social issues, it's not at all clear what he's saying.

""Django Unchained"" received a host of nominations and awards, including Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay, awarded to Christoph Waltz and Quentin Tarantino respectively. Both of those men received BAFTAs in the same categories. I assume this is the Academy being self-congratulatory, because it believes ""Django Unchained"" is some sort of enlightened statement about racism. I wonder if Quentin Tarantino has grasped the irony in his being lauded for being politically correct. It must have been a new experience for him. But I very much doubt that he intended to make any political statement with this film. It's slow and long and unsophisticated, one of Tarantino's weaker efforts. A watered down version of ""Inglourious Basterds."" And Christoph Waltz's performance is a shadow of his brilliant turn in that movie.",1374537600,2,3344,5.305660377358491

5259474,3,B00947NAHU,"Unlike many film fans here, I'm not one of the Tarantino ""herd."" In my view, ""Django Unchained"" is a typical QT movie: some great scenes and acting interspersed with excessive gore and repellent exploitation of violence, slavery, and use of the ""N"" word.

While it is true that the word was used as a regular part of the American vocabulary in the era around the American Civil War, Django hardly qualifies as historical in many respects. An example of this is when Django and his partner Dr. King Shultz (brilliantly played by Cristoph Waltz) ride into Greenville, Mississippi like conquering heroes. Mississippi was the heart of the racist, slave-owning South prior to (and well after) the Civil War. No way would a black man be able to get away with that during the era depicted.

Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie has to be one of the most despicable film characters in recent memory. From an acting perspective, he does a fine job, but the dialogue Tarantino gives him seems to revel in hatred and racism. Instead of sending a message and leaving it at that, Tarantino rubs it in the face of the audience. I cringed at the ""Mandingo"" fight scene, and I'm not easily affected by movie violence.

As is Tarantino's trademark, the film is way too long. Most of the filler is the many disturbing scenes I mentioned, as well as the long, long, buildups to the violent confrontations we know are coming. My feeling is this would be a 5-star film if Tarantino could have managed to restrain his over-the-top instincts just this once. But this is QT, and going overboard is what he does.

Tarantino seems to have no belief in the fundamental goodness of humanity.  The first two thirds of the movie were powerful, if weighty.

Liked it more than I expected to.  I'm a middle age african american woman and I read reviews that said the film used the N word alot, and as I hate that word and everything it stands for, I expected to dislike the film and watched it out of curiousity (free for library patrons), and found I liked parts of it.  With my aversion to the word, I muted the film and watched it with subtitles, which helped me tolerate the word as best I could.  well structured film story (especially first act, weaker third, but that's due mainly to poorly realized DiCaprio and his sister's characterizations).  all the actors were good.  I thought of it as a cross between Cinderella (had Cinderella been an african american male slave in pre-civil war america, with a fairy godfather (the german) instead of a fairy godmother), and Luke/Obiwan mentee/mentor relationship, rite of passage story (though Jamie Fox is alittle ""seasoned"" for a mentee (Christoph (django's benefactor) refers to him initially as young django, yet Christoph himself doesn't seem that much older than Jamie, so writer/director was pushing it there).

I thought the film highly romantic as the german character not only rescues django from slavery, but trains and mentors him, offers him a lucrative job (where he earns thousands of dollars during the course of one winter season when most people likely earned only hundreds during their lifetime), and helps him locate and free his wife.  Basically in django unchained we see django win the fairy godfather lottery.  Some caucasian american viewers criticized the film for showing an ugly part of american history, but really, the characters I assume the viewers disliked, the caucasian males in dominant societal and business positions (slaveowners) were mitigated by having django's mentor be caucasian and male, and he's obviously a good guy.  doesn't matter that he's german and not american: he's the kindest and most generous person in the story, so Mr. Tarentino (sp?) was not being anti-caucasian or anti-male, and american slavery existed and it wasn't pretty, no reason not to use it as a backdrop against which to set a mentee/mentor, rite of passage story.

Hyper bloody film similar to Kill Bill's cartoony violence and so usual for this director.

Mostly unusual because don't often see african american male slaves from this period in history end up as winners in hollywood film stories, which of course makes sense as no for profit business wants to alienate a significant customer base (caucasian americans), but I think Tarentino (sp?) mitigates this by not only chosing his mentor wisely (making one of his heros male caucasian) but also creating powerful house slave and paramour characters who did nothing to help their people, but instead used their positions to further ingratiate themselves into the affections of their owner.  In my opinion then, the characters I would have more liked to see fully fleshed out were the Samuel L. Jackson character and Leo DeCaprio's paramour (I think her name was Sheba); those characters would have really been interesting to explore and understand, but at least the writer included them, and they added a complexity to the story which cut across the cartoony, shallow presentation of the slaveowners.

I wonder if these two roles were included to suggest that some african american slaves had some power in their slavery - historically it is likely a very tiny percentage of them did, but I'd guess that 99.9% of them did not, so it's disingenuous to cast a star of Samuel L. Jackson's stature in the role of head house slave, Stephen, and show his great physical and psychological intimacy (i.e., power) with the DeCaprio character; by adding such star power to that character, the writer in my opinion suggests that some african americans participated in the american slave trade and benefited from it.  Again, possibly true, and if so, very likely an extremely tiny percentage.  To my mind, just another way writer/director is showing he is not championing african americans by presenting this story, but merely using this time period in american history to generate the highest amount of ""talk"" factor to generate ticket sales.

Speaking of the slaveowners, I'd have also preferred a more understandable and believable presentation of the Leo DiCaprio character, and his sister, who are the weakest links in the story, in my opinion.  For instance, when he set dogs on the man who refused to fight anymore, losing $200 in the process, would have helped to show why he was willing to lose $200.  I think by having DiCaprio and Django staring at each other was supposed to imply a competition between them, but I think maybe men might have understood that: as I'm a woman, I would've preferred something more clear cut - why would a businessman willingly lose $200, when in those days $200 meant a whole lot.  Also, why was DiCaprio character so miffed after he flipped a slave he'd owned for what, a few months, for a huge profit, to the extent he was willing to blow the entire deal.

Whatever Mr. Tarentino meant by DiCaprio's behavior, just wasn't clear enough to me.  Having a psycho, macho, wealthy guy you don't have to clearly explain is fine if your audience is psycho, macho, wealthy guys; for the rest of us, we need to understand his motivation and I just didn't get enough information to understand him.  I wish the writer hadn't given short shrift to DiCaprio's sister: she was played like a entitled, sorority girl - I wish she'd been presented as especially beautiful and a person in her own right - because her character was treated disrespectfully (as an airhead) by the writer, can understand why some caucaian viewers feel the film made southern slaveholders appear as caricatures.  She should have been written seriously and presented as beautiful as possible, and she and her brother's motivations completely revealed to the audience.  It's easy (and lazy writing) to take potshots at citizens (via extreme characterizations) who are dead and who cannot defend their position or what they stood for.  Of course, I'm not defending slavery, which I've read is alive, well and thriving as I write this review (though I do not know specifics), but by failing to show solid character motivations of the DiCaprio character, and his sister, the writer misses an opportunity to show a truer face of slavery, instead of the cartoonish characters he presented, i.e., helping us see ourselves in those characters and some of our traits that we should discourage.

Disliked much of the music (when I occasionally turned up the sound).  Nice touches of humor i.e., when django chose his first clothes, and the slave girls who were shocked by django's boldly stated opinions at dinner.  Very much liked the fairy godfather, Christoph Waltz (who presents as slightly dangerous in films to me), and of course, Jamie Fox was very good.  Samuel L. Jackson seemed to especially enjoy his villainous role and played it well.  Overall, if you can ignore the N word, film didn't suck - because of the excessive use of that word I wouldn't buy it had I available funds.  Enjoyed the first act the best, I think because Christoph Waltz was just an unpredictable lead character trying to help others in an unpretentious and matter of fact manner - which I like seeing in fiction, and in real life.

Grade: 2 and 1/2 stars. Would have given it 3 and 1/2 stars but one half star subtracted for excessive use of N word, and one half star subtracted for slaveowner caricature (specifically DiCaprio and his sister); felt both were cheap shots the writer should have worked harder to avoid.

Slaveowners were the villains in this story, and they just weren't well written.  My opinion, it's poor storytelling (though common in film) to under write villains - yet villains are far more important to a story (in terms of structure) than a hero/heroine, as they power the story  (example, Star Wars: what work would Luke have had to do if the empire wasn't running around acting mad-dog crazy, blowing up a planet, murdering innocent farmers and such), and if a writer doesn't take the time or bother to make the villains understandable, writer loses audience intellectual and emotional participation.  Example, Star Wars again, what if George Lucas had left out the meeting where all the top military brass got together to discuss strategy.  What if it just wasn't included, no stars in that scene, no explosions, so in hollywood terms the scene is unnecessary, yet George Lucas took the time to write and film it, and his editors understood it's importance enough to include it in the final cut.  why? because without that scene, villains later behavior in acts 2 and 3 wouldn't make sense.

And if the villains make no sense, the audience cannot participate intellectually (or emotionally), and if the audience cannot participate, the story is a fail.  Audiences need a villain that makes sense.  we don't have to agree with villain's pov, but we need to know what that pov is, and it's gotta be believable in the real world. It doesn't have to be politically correct, in fact, an effective villain's behavior shouldn't be socially acceptable to the audience (that's what makes them the villain), but we need to recognize it as something a person(s) with few behavioral restraints would do. Believable, recognizable, those are key, important words in crafting an effective villain. I see film after film do over-the-top mad dog egocentric villains, but they don't work because the villain's behavior isn't grounded in the audience's reality.  For story's to work, it must use the audience's understanding of reality, with specific plot points, so that when a villain misbehaves, the audience knows why, and accepts it and believes it. story is a dance between audience and writer, without proper set up, and use of the audience's reality, over the top villains leave the audience detached. (I'll write a screenplay to see if I can prove my theories.)

Regarding slavery, I know this film is fiction, but slavery exists to this day and the writer/director could have elevated his story by humanizing the slavers.  instead of making the DiCaprio character power mad and/or unbalanced and/or bored and/or whatever (incest is suggested by having the brother/sister greet by kissing on the mouth), he could have used his subject to give the audience insight into human nature.  Instead of making the siblings incestuous (weird) and therefore not us, he might have shown the dirty underbelly of why slavery still persists - that sometimes good people are willing to take advantage of the socially, economically, politically, educationally or technologically, weak.  It is not one of our finer characteristics, but it is the truth.  The best story's tell us the truth about ourselves, even the unflattering truths.  but we do have the ability to change, and sometimes just flashing a bright light on a subject helps us as individuals be more self-aware.  For instance, just taking an example, someone seeing a film where slavery is a featured backdrop might in future turn down an invitation by a suspiciously young looking prostitute, and see that invitation in terms of sex slavery, which victimizes children (and adults) throughout the world.  Good story's help us see our choices have an impact.

This is a movie, so not the end of the world, and I'll look for the writer's next projects, which I hope will have fewer racial slurs.  In the movies with the slurs, I just won't buy them.  Put another way, I'm assuming Mr. Tarentino is caucasian, I don't imagine he frequents films where characters frequently use racial slurs against his own ethnic group.  Yet apparently he feels comfortable writing characters who drop N bombs left/right.  Notice he doesn't make film after film with racist slurs against jewish people, as it's well known the film industry has some jewish power players, and if he used racist slurs against that group, he might have difficulty getting some of his films made.  Easy to use racial slurs against those with less power.

P.S. Just remembered another thing I liked - the shootout when the Chris Waltz character sadly dies, but where django fights off a mini-army which just happens to be on the plantation, liked that django didn't shoot a magical gun with unlimited bullets, but showed how a fighter used the weapons of dead opponents to extend his firing capacity.",1374105600,10,12473,4.954916067146283

If the movie has any redeeming quality, it is in some top-notch acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is utterly believable as he is hate-worthy, and Christoph Waltz who steals every scene he is in.

5259537,1,B00947NAHU,"20 REASONS THIS MOVIE IS BAD:

1) It's a boring, slow, badly paced, disjointed story.

2) It's WAY too talky.  This is a Western, Westerns aren't suppose to be about people just sitting around tables and rock croppings just talking endlessly.

3) It's way too preachy.  Slavery was wrong?  That's your message you keep hitting the audience over the head with?  150 years ago slavery was a bad thing?  Ahhh, no sheet, Sherlock.  And to suggest all Southern White people back then were evil?  I mean, come on.

4) The ""hero,"" Django, is boring, weak and unrealistic.  He's NOT a cool or interesting character at all.  He has ZERO personality.  He's a total dud as a ""hero.""

5) Jamie Fox's acting (as Django) is boring, weak and unrealistic, which made the ""hero"" even more lame.

6) Django, a slave who had never fired a gun in his life, suddenly picks up a gun and is an instant expert bulls-eye quick-fire deadly killer shot with both pistols and a rifle??? Capable of single-handedly slaughtering a dozen heavily-armed men in a gun fight?  TOTALLY unrealistic.

7) Half the guns in this movie did not exist in 1858.  The guns were so wrong.  Don't set a movie in 1858 if you're not going to use guns from 1858.  Also, Dynamite did not exist in 1858.  Yet it's a key factor in 3 scenes.  Obviously, no research went into making this movie even try to be somewhat accurate to 1858.

8) The violence/action (what little there is) is WAY over-the-top cartoony with people looking like they are being shot with huge .50 caliber machine gun bullets.  The shootouts in the movie are just ridiculously bad.

9) The period dialog is way off, with virtually no character remotely talking like a person who lived in the 19th century.  Some of slang that characters use is from the 1980s and 1990s.  I mean the writer should have studied and researched, at least a little, how people actually talked back then.

10) Some of the locations don't even remotely look like the true ""South.""  Particularly the scene where the stupid Aussies get killed.  That's California, NOT Mississippi.  No place in Old Miss looks like that.  Who was the location scout on this movie???

11) The music/soundtrack is horrible.  I mean rap songs in a Western?  How dumb.  And some of the scenes felt like crappy music videos, with nothing going on except for the song, like the scene was there just so they could play the dumb song.  REALLY bad use of music in this movie.

12) The cinematography and editing are terrible.  For example, so many scenes cry out for Close Up shots of the characters--because they're constantly talking--yet there are very few Close Ups in the movie.  It's like the filmmakers don't want us to see the characters for some reason.  One scene in particular, the introduction of ""Big Daddy"" REALLY needed some Close Ups of Don Johnson, yet there were ZERO.  Ruined the whole scene.

13) Django supposedly wants to rescue his slave wife, yet he waits months and months, through an entire winter, before he goes and tries to rescue her?  Yeah, I think I'll wait 3 or 4 months before I go rescue my poor slave wife who's probably getting raped, whipped and beaten; who may even get pregnant from some random guy; but I'll just wait months before I go try to help her.  Totally illogical.

14) King Shultz also has NO motivation to help Django go rescue his wife.  Maybe if the lazy writer had written a scene were Django SAVED King's life I might have bought into King risking his life's savings and his own neck to go help Django.  But, no, the movie writer just has King going off and doing all that with no compelling reason.  You don't even get the sense King likes or bonds with Django that much.  So there's really no reason I buy that King would help Django.

15) Toward the end, when King shoots Candie, he has a 2-shot derringer and could easily spin around and try to shoot Candie's henchman with the shotgun, yet DOESN'T.  And King's supposed to be this expert bounty hunter/killer, yet doesn't even try to shoot the goon with the shotgun who has orders to kill Hildy???  It's totally illogical.  Again, lazy writing.

16) What's also illogical is that King (and Django by extention) are bounty hunters (officers of the court), yet they are also cold-blooded killers who kill a slaver-trader and Big Daddy in cold blood.  Wouldn't King and Django become wanted fugitives themselves hunted by other bounty hunters for killing these men???  Especially Big Daddy who's an important plantation owner?  It makes no sense.  AND, then to top it all off, King kills Candie at the end with no legal justification.  King's always spouting off about how he's an office of the court, then he just murders people because he doesn't agree with them or like them??? It's like there's NO logic at all in this movie.

17) There's no real emotion of any kind.  It could have been a great ""buddy movie,"" with King and Django bonding and becoming like ""brothers"" or ""father and son,"" yet there's no great bonding moments between them.  Likewise, we're just told Django and Hildy have this great love for each other, yet we're never shown a reason why they love each other so much.  There's no romance, no great love story of any kind.  There's no soul or heart to this movie at all.

18) The most important aspect of a story is that the hero defeats the villain.  Yet in this movie, screwed up as it is, the supporting character, King, kills the main villain, Candie.  NOT Django.  So the main villain dies (the movie should be over), but no, due to the crappy writing, there's like 20 minutes left in the movie where the hero, Django, just goes around killing the 3rd-string villains--actors and characters we don't even know or really care about!  It's just bad writing!

19) Another instance of bad writing is the fact that Django, a black man and former slave, is THE REASON that super powerful plantation owner villain Candie gets killed.  The plantation caretakers and Candie's Sister want revenge in the worst way and they have captured Django.  They can slowly torture him to death, do the worst things imaginable, yet for NO logical reason AT ALL they decide to just give him to a mining company so he can break rocks.  They want revenge in the worst way, are about to cut off his balls, yet, ahhhh, no, we won't cut off his balls, instead, we'll just give him away to a mining company.  WHAT????  Retarded! What's worse, getting your balls CUT OFF or having to break rocks all day?  Plus, they, the Candieland people, don't get to see Django suffer.  Again, it's just really bad writing.  Lazy.  Illogical.

20) And number 20, at the end, Django, slaughters a white woman, Candie's Sister, who doesn't do anything evil or bad the entire movie.  Her only sin, I guess, is being white and living in the Antebellum South.  And for that, Django slaughters her?  LAZY WRITING.  All the writer had to do was make her an evil bitch.  Yet he wasn't a good enough writer to make her worthy of Django's vengeance.  So again, Django's not an angel of vengeance, but rather just a murderer who murders a poor white woman for no good reason.  And he's suppose to be the hero?  The writer of this movie must have been on some serious drugs when he wrote it.

But honestly there were certain deaths in both movies that were gratutious and unnecessary and ruined the film.  Dr. Schultz didn't need to die, and neither did Bridget von Hammersmark...over the top  And Django especially REALLY dragged on and on.  Where is the editing?  Is Tarantino getting so big like Stephen King & JK Rowling that no one will edit his work?  Both these films lacked the satisfaction of Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction.",1373587200,,556,4.903225806451613

We get a lot of the songs and musical interludes common to such films. The open landscapes are thrilling as is the background of slavery 2 years before the Civil War in 1858. The film is shot in the Western genre. There is a liberal use of the n------- word. The violence is of a cartoon variety,blood spurting out of bodies filled with lead. There are endless scenes of dialogue between King Schulz (Christof Waltz) and Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx).Waltz is good at the ornate verbal flourishes of Tarantino's dialogue. Foxx plays his character of the freed slave with a laconic intensity. He seems to have little personality and is largely in debt to King Schulz,who is the mentor,bounty-hunter and leader who plucks him from slavery to help him kill the Brittle Brothers. He uses Django as a bounty-hunter pursuing a gang of criminals. He is then led on a journey to save his wife,Broomhilda,a German-speaking slave from a plantation owner,Clavin J Candie(Ci Caprio) an enthusiast of to-the-death Mandingo fighting. Di Caprio is suitably malevolent as the owner of Candyland and gives impetus to the second part of the film. Samuel L Jackson is great as the head butler Stephen,the film's real antagonist,the real leader of the plantation house,sly,subtle,vindictive,nasty. An archetypal Uncle Tom of grovelling slave-subject mentality,speaking for his master. It's he that cottons on to the disguise of the Mandigo expert's cover of the strangers. Candie's Mississippi estate is like Versailles,with slaves seemingly on swings or wandering around or at the master's table,dining. The plantation has few workers in the fields and their dress seems too unruffled.

You could say that Tarantino's take on slavery is offensive,with the slaves depicted as passive zombies or victims of abuse(in one case an aging slave no longer useful for Mandingo fighting is torn apart by dogs) or whipping. They don't express themselves or even communicate with each other. But Tarantino comes at the subject like he did the Nazis in Inglourious Basterds. We can take pot shots at these oppressive slave-owners and traders. It's a given. It's a movie and its entertainment first and foremost:its approach to slavery is not Lincoln's or Amistad's depending on historical accuracy. No,hell we'll just do it,although Django is shown to go through hell to rescue Broomhilda. Tarantino makes an appearance too. The film could have done with about 25 minutes editing and the director's acting is not good. A scene of KKK Klansmen is totally gratuitious. Broomhilda is a passive character and the union with Django seems an anti-climax as their dialogue is drowned out with music. I still think Tarantino's best was Jackie Brown followed by Pulp Fiction. This is slavery as fodder for a pulp B Western movie, too sloppy, unfocused, and thematically unresolved. The film does have a beautiful,retro painterly look.",1372896000,,3050,5.224489795918367

5259708,2,B00947NAHU,"Note:  My original review is below, but I re-rated my opinion to two stars from four as this was such an irresponsible movie that denies the truth Sergio Leone found in the Old West and the Civil War and totally is unbelievable from a standpoint on the truth of history.  It is NOT the Best Original Screenplay.  It is another Quentin Tarantino ""pastiche"" to other people's works as it makes Peter Bogdanovich's ""pastiches"" look like the real thing.  To allow people to think for one minute that blacks were treated as such during slavery is to deny their true triumph over the injustices of racism.  Who needs someone spending millions of dollars to turn out irresponsible unbelievable self-indulgences (like the acting in this film)?

Review:  Quentin Tarantino's latest epic ""Django Unchained,"" called a ""revisionist Western about slavery"" suffers from the same delusions as his ""revisionist World War II film about the Nazis"" that offered Brad Pitt's least capable performance (I am sure his AAN for BSActor for ""12 Monkeys"" was because there was a shortage of good performances that year and his penance for playing someone mentally challenged so simply is he should watch Robert DeNiro in ""Aawkenings"" 20 times).  ""Django Unchained"" and ""Inglorious Basterds"""" have nothing to do with history.  It's all a rip-off.  ""Django Unchained"" rips off the title character from a spaghetti western and where Sergio Leone used caution in depicting the ravages of the Civil War in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" Tarantino, when presented the Old South and slavery before the War, presents a spectacle that those poor impoverished creatures, including the plantation owners, would never see.  Costumes, fabrics, set pieces, and many other natural historical inaccuracies are given the modern day sensibilities that are strictly for fantasists and anyone curious about slavery ought to see ""Mandingo"" more so as it was on planet earth.  Christopher Waltz takes away acting honors from both films (""Django Unchained"""" and ""Inglorious Basterds"") which is a measure of how good he is as an actor, not that these were anything but ""characters"" in largely entertaining movies, whose faults at anything serious, should send Tarantino back to his blueprint for the wildly successful, but more sensibly set ""Pulp Fiction.""",1372464000,,2309,5.1940700808625335
5259709,5,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained totally blew me away with its audacity, boldness, and complete dedication to its underlying themes. Slavery was a dirty, dirty business, and just as Speilberg so bravely showed the evil men do in Schindler's List, Tarantino pulls no punches in his brutal bloody opus. That Django (beautifully played by Jamie Foxx) risked life and liberty to save his lady love (the gorgeous Kerry Washington), slaying dragon after dragon, was a tribute to the kind of black man we don't see much of in current cinema. Tarantino outdid himself and his Best Original Screenplay Oscar was well deserved. This is truly a brilliant piece of filmmaking.

(Why aren't more films like this being made?).  The only thing I didn't like at ALL was the unrealisticly exagerated volumes of gloppy looking gore errupting from every gunshot wound or head cracking.

5259732,5,B00947NAHU,This is one of Quentin's films that make you scratch your head and wonder how he comes up with some of the content?  The way this movie pits stereotypes against each other in certain situations is ingenious.  My favorite would be the introduction of Samuel L. Jackson (playing an Uncle Tom) to Jamie Foxx who in this scene is pretending to play the part of an Uncle Tom.

5259733,5,B00947NAHU,"In 1858, the year in which the film is set, there were around 4.5 million slaves in the United States a tiny fraction of whom were treated relatively decently by their owners and as many of us, I imagine, receive the majority of our history lessons through the medium of film, the closest representatives of this enlightened bunch would be the owners of Tara and Twelve Oaks from Margaret Mitchell's (or David O. Selznick's) Gone With the Wind. Following the opening title sequence of the film of that book is a little ditty that would seek to persuade viewers of the heroic nature of the old south:

`There was a land of Cavaliers and Cotton fields called the Old South.......
Here in this pretty world Gallantry took its last bow.
Here was the last to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of Master and of Slave.

Look for it only in books for it is a dream remembered.

A Civilization gone with the wind.'

I suppose it all depends upon your personal definitions of `civilization' and `gallantry', a point many of those 4.5 million might have contested had they been given even the slightest opportunity.

Tarantino's film, is positioned at the other end of the spectrum in terms of `slave' movies and, as such, stands in stark contrast to the cotton candy fluff depicted in GWTW. It will be no surprize to his fans that there are scenes of graphic violence: but, set against this, Tarantino's particular brand of humour is evident throughout, particularly personified in the performance of the excellent Christoph Waltz and the somewhat idiosyncratic soundtrack. There is also the rather `in your face' homage to the spaghetti western complete with Morricone score and an amusing send up of W. D. Griffith's `The Birth of a Nation' in which some ku klux clowns argue about the quality of their ridiculous head gear!

But, aside from being superbly entertaining and some marvellous performances, notably by Samuel L Jackson and the brilliant DiCaprio, the film is a powerful indictment of the kind `civilization' that took for granted the subjugation of a whole people simply on the basis of their colour.",1372204800,,2113,4.823204419889502

Consistent tone, well shot, great soundtrack, solid story, and really good performances by every main actor.

Also Jamie has a strong mind and will not do a movie for the money. On to the movie itself, its a very good movie and takes you on another level of cowboys and slavery.

Several fine actors do their job well.  Dicaprio plays a southern gentleman villain well.  Samuel L. Jackson is a hateful Uncle Tom.
Jamie Foxx's performance as a rebel slave works.  The evil German officer from Inglorious Bastards does it again.

Quentin Tarantino delivers freshly shocking violence.

Its Pulp Fiction good, no joke. All the actors are perfect for their roles, the story is a little cliche but is retold in a very new and interesting way, and the score and camera work are spot on.

5259802,5,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained has been a controversial movie, but then it is dealing with a controversial subject and it isn't holding back. For the sake of this review, I will ignore the controversies, though suffice it to say it is dealing with subject matter (slavery) many would prefer to not be reminded of. In telling its story there are many instances where some might perceive racism or racist sentiments. If you feel that this is something you might not want to deal with (or gory violence) this is probably not the movie for you.

What makes this movie so fascinating to watch is that it has a strong message, it doesn't hold back (it may well not go far enough, but within the scope of the movie I'd argue it goes the distance) in conveying the horrors that was slavery. Still, whilst it has that strong message, the movie is not really a movie about slavery, rather it is a revenge film, with some elements of a heist/con, all whilst trying to robe it self in the clothes of a Spaghetti Western.

But it is so much more, there is a meta narrative completely detached from the events, that is entirely focused on direction and effects. This isn't about violence, though naturally it applies to everything in the movie. The camera angles, the color saturation, the set design and scene setups are all copied from other films, and generally the genre of old (though color) Westerns. And the some of the blood splatter, that goes back even further, to Japanese Samurai films which were the inspiration for the Spaghetti Westerns. It's almost like watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul/dp/B005BZQVJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul</a>&nbsp;and noting how movie quotes from sci-fi films are re-used both ironically as well as straight faced. And here is the thing: Tarantino pulls it off. The movie looks and feels right, and more honest than any Western before it, precisely because most Westerns were being idyllic even as they discussed crime, by glossing over what those times were probably like. So big props for style, substance and story.

The acting is superb, and really this should not be a surprise. None of the major roles are portrayed by unknowns, but instead fantastic actors. Christoph Waltz was brilliant and unnerving in Inglorious Basterds; Jamie Foxx with the right role is always great, and he is right for this role. Not in a typecast sort of way, but precisely because it isn't and he pulls it off unwaveringly and with conviction. DiCaprio is stellar though arguably this is the weakest character because you could believe he is just being himself. I don't mean DiCaprio is the kind of guy that would do what his character does, rather that his character just is so oblivious of his own nature, and it is incredible how well DiCaprio brings it to life. And finally, Samuel L Jackson ... when is he not doing a stellar job, but being such a vindictive and backstabbing bastard, with that much costume ... I didn't initially pick that it was Jackson. Again, fantastic performances all around.

So, is this movie really this perfect? No of course not, because firstly there are language, setting and style issues. This is a movie made in 2012 (or whatever) imitating something 50 years older, but at the same time it isn't trying to imitate the product, rather the style and time those movies were imitating. Think of this as being a ""retro"" style movie, with modern language and some technologies, and probably attitudes. This isn't a docu-drama, this is a Tarantino film, and it has many of the hallmarks, especially in language, interesting use of techniques and Samuel L Jackson swearing. But if you accept that he set out to make roughly what you made, you will see that he made exactly what he aimed for. All those things you might note and think ""that's not right"" are probably there very intentionally.

The subject of this movie is a sensitive one and it should not be made light off. Still, it is treated well, and with respect. The film is definitely one of Tarantino's best (though which movies was not great).",1371772800,,4088,4.884726224783861

5259805,5,B00947NAHU,"I'm not a consistent fan of Quentin Tarantino movies. Some I find good, others leave me flat.

This movie I thoroughly enjoyed. Well thought out script, and superb acting by Christoph Waltz. It is the story of a German Dr. turned bounty hunter (Dr. King Schultz), and a uneducated but savvy slave (Django) who becomes his partner. Waltz's character is both compassionate and heartlessly ruthless, yet he pulls it off masterfully.

Set in about 1859, 2 years before the American Civil War, these two wage a bloody war on wanted criminals. They also have a secondary mission which I will leave you to see.

Great movie. Django... the ""D"" is silent. ;-)",1371772800,,650,4.785714285714286

Christoph Waltz  is mesmerizing. His portrayal of Dr. King Schultz seems effortless, warm, and genuine and was one of the best things about the film, Jamie Foxx was the perfect choice as Django and surprisingly nuanced. Equally pleasurable to watch was Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie. He portrays the perfect mercurial, psychotic plantation owner. However, my description of his portrayal doesn't even cover the many facets that you see on the surface, and especially the glimpses you get beneath the surface. Samuel L.

5259840,5,B00947NAHU,"This movie is the best example yet of Quentin Tarentino's cinematic sense of humor in messing with history. His (Oscar-winning) screenplay is saying: ""WHAT IF a SLAVE could be FREED and then turn into an all-destroying ANGEL whose wrath brings down at least one small section section of the utterly corrupt & evil empire of the Old South?""

Christoph Waltz turns in another Oscar-winning performance (Best Supporting Actor) as the German dentist who turns his back on Medicine and slips into the role of Predator of Bad Guys in the Old West -- a bounty hunter. He makes good money by using his cunning & gunplay to bringing the WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE crowd to justice: ALL DEAD!

Django is taken in by the former dentist (King Schultz) to help him identify three wanted men who are working as overseers. Schultz doesn't know what they look loke, but Django does. After some gunslinger training, Django quickly becomes oustanding in his own right in the deadly game of hunting down wanted murderers. He seeks to locate and rescue his wife, who was sold away from the plantation where they were once both held as slaves.

Over-the-top bloody violence is a staple of Tarentino movies, and there are plenty of gory gunshot special effects in this entertaining ""buddy movie"" of two men (Django & Schultz) who bring much-delayed justice to slave masters & outlaws in the South & Old West.

Two additional charming features of this film are, in addition to its sense of Moral Rectitude & vengeance falling upon the wicked like Jove's thunderbolt: 1) Tarentino has rounded up just about EVERY living old-time cowboy movie actor for a bit part in the film and 2) Quentin himself appears in it, as one of the villains!",1371427200,,1707,4.776271186440678

Jamie Foxx was outstanding and is truly a GIFTED ACTOR and talent ,,, as well as the supporting cast.

In closing: The use of the ""n-word"" here is with ""poetic license"". It's USE is to show ALL Amerikan (sic) self-described (pig) ""whitey"" HOW NOT TO REFER TO HUMAN BEINGS!

5259858,4,B00947NAHU,"This movie is very good, but it could have been brilliant. The problem for me is that it's a bit of a jumble. Part cheesy spaghetti-western tribute (not particularly well done, IMO) with some outright comedy (hilarious at times), modern music thrown in (seemed like an afterthought), with comic-book-violence (just because it's expected in a QT movie) and the result is.......a movie that doesn't seem to quite know where it's at. QT should have either made a ""proper"" spaghetti-western, or a modern western, or an typical QT stylized western. Instead he tried to juggle all of those, and the result doesn't quite work out. Brilliant at times....clumsy and self-gratifying at others. I would give the movie itself 3 stars.

What this film DOES have though is some truly exceptional performances. Christopher Waltz is astounding (again) and creates one of the most memorable characters I've seen in quite a while. DiCaprio takes on a role that doesn't seem quite right for him, but really pulls it off with gusto! Samuel L Jackson's hilariously cranky old Stephen is the best performance I've seen from him since Pulp Fiction. Even Don Johnson puts in the performance of a lifetime. For his part, Jamie Foxx makes for an excellent Django - brooding yet confident. With these characters all working together (the negotiations over dinner, for example) the result is incredibly tense and compelling - classic QT stuff. For the performances I'd give this movie 5 stars.

Although not his best movie, thank god for Quentin Tarantino!",1371427200,,1528,5.059523809523809

5259861,5,B00947NAHU,"Here's a further opportunity to appreciate how Quentin Tarantino makes his art. The long, slow building of tension in scenes that last half an hour or more until they erupt in unbelievable violence. The celebration of revenge. Jamie Fox is fine as the lead, Django. Christoph Waltz's Dr. King Schultz is a surprisingly sympathetic character as the man who purchases Django, and teaches him to become a bounty hunter. Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant as Calvin J. Candie, the evil white plantation owner who has his slaves fight each other to the death for sport, and gets wind of Django's plan to rescue his wife from Candie's plantation. Samuel L. Jackson is almost unrecognizable as Stephen, the ever-loyal servant to Candie. Long, long conversation, realization of the stakes, and then, boom!

5259863,3,B00947NAHU,"Like fellow director and scriptwriter Kevin Smith, Quentin Tarrantino seems to have been heavily influenced by heavy indulgence in old videotapes, and his ""Django Unchained"" might be considered a multihomage to old Westerns, horror films, and blaxploitation films. In that spirit, this is a lot of fun, and occasionally funny, but partly because of that referential indulgence, I can't see how Tarantino picked up an Oscar for the screenplay. The plotline is determined but not all that imaginative, much of the dialogue is attitudinal or ludicrous (depending on the characters), and the whole thing is full of gimmicks, some of them admittedly fascinating. Making your way from plot point to incredible plot point, you might pick up a bit of American history (it's set in the mid-19th Century), but parents with an eye to educating their offspring had better put an eye and an ear to consider whether the rather two-dimensional lessons are worth the obscenity and the bloodbath.",1371340800,,979,5.163522012578617

I am a big fan of westerns and of most of Tarantino's movies too so this seemed to me like a ""can't miss"".  It's not really a miss it's just a bit too long for it's own good.  As a matter of fact I watched the first hour of Django Unchained with a HUGE smile on my face and thinking that this is the best western film in probably 20 years.  As in most of Tarantino's movies the '70's cinema influence is obvious and actually works in the film's favor.  The first hour plays a little like a harder edged version of The Skin Game -1971-(James Garner and Lou Gossett Jr- if you haven't seen it check it out).  Beautiful cinematography, clever dialogue, and exciting characters kept my eyes on the screen for every frame.  Then the story lands in one location: Candieland, the plantation owned by Leonardo DeCaprio's character Calvin Candie.  He has become the owner of Django's wife and Django (Jamie Foxx) has come there with his new mentor, and rescuer from bondage, bounty Hunter Dr. King Schulz (brilliantly played by Christoph Waltz) to free her.  At this point it's still a great film but I think a little too much time was spent on this section of the film.  The second half of the second act seems like filler to me.  We could have gotten to the point a little faster and not lost any of the story.  The third act has a classic, if not a bit cliche by now, Tarantino bloodbath resolution.  Django Unchained has a running time of 2 hours 45 minutes and does suffer a bit from excessive length.  It's a brilliant first act, followed by a flawed second act, ending with a cliched but pretty cool third act.  I like this film but when I watch it again in the future it will probably be in two sittings.

5259915,1,B00947NAHU,"SPOILER ALERT! The movie starts. From there on out, it's spoiled.

Leave it to Tarantino to use a decent story, great actors, and great photography and take them on a whirlwind tour from cheesy ripoff to ridiculous farce. He said that he wanted to do a ""genre film"" but apparently doesn't understand the difference between ""homage"" and artistic sodomy. Not that spaghetti westerns were great films by most standards. But paying tribute to a style and making a complete mockery of it, while still expecting your movie to be taken seriously? Well, that's just a little beyond idiotic. Ever since his early successes he seems bent on seeing how far he can push an audience before they finally decide that's the last of their money he'll ever see. Remember Quentin, Jerry Lewis may have been considered a genius, but only by the French.

Let's suspend disbelief long enough to accept the premise of the film. No, make that ""the movie."" I've seen better film on teeth! But let's say we accept the premise. Even if he's addressing the glaring inhumanity of slavery, he seems confused as to the difference between Django becoming a free man and being an equal. About the time he shot the first white man, whether he was free and justified or not, he'd have been strung up and that would be the end of the movie. Even beyond that, Tarantino seems to have less understanding than most four-year-old children have of what happens when someone gets shot! A single shot from a pistol whips a woman's body out of the scene as if tied to a rocket; other shots resulting in fountains of blood spewing into the air and coating walls in a way that would make Monty Python envious!

And apparently, Tarantino now fancies himself to be Alfred Hitchcock, sneaking his ever widening butt onto the screen wherever he can. Hint: Hitchcock was being playful and joking around by doing it, and it became his signature. He wasn't just whoring for camera time. Hitch also didn't feel the need to have someone decapitated in order to scare or shock an audience. In fact, he never showed Janet Leigh actually stabbed even one time in the famous shower scene from Psycho. In addition to those examples, he also had more talent in the second roll on his chin than you could ever hope for.

And yet this dog of a movie received 5 Oscar nominations and actually WON for best screenplay? Of course, this is the same industry that thinks it's a good idea to put out The Expendables II, The Last Exorcism Part II, and now a sequel to Finding Nemo. They've started remaking not only GOOD films, but crappy ones as well. (Did we REALLY need another ""Total Recall?"") So, rest easy Quentin. Perhaps H. L. Mencken was right when he said ""Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public."" It appears your career is safe.",1370995200,40,2809,4.668686868686868

Jamie Foxx got on TV and talking about the movie,joke or not,that he gets to kill all the white people in the movie. This wouldn't have bothered me if we didn't have a racist president and his Administration that we have now.

Like many such ""fictionalized"" tales that attempt to condense many years (in this case several centuries) into a 90 minute story, some of the scenes stretched reality almost to the breaking point. But the movie did convey the degradation and abhorrently inhuman nature of the system of slavery as practiced in America. Unfortunately, historians have done a great disservice to the nation by not fully dealing with it in all its ugliness. They have treated this chapter in American history almost as a postscript, brushing it ""under the rug"" so to speak lest it mar the brave, courageous, glory-filled picture that they try to paint about our past. The result is that the legacy of slavery still lingers. We see it in the many poverty stricken tenement cities still present in large metropolitan centers mostly in the north where crime and underachievement is rampant. It was present in the xenophobic "" us against them "" mentality that resulted in our Government placing Japanese Americans in concentration camps during WW-2 and now in the immigration debates going on in the nation's capital.

""Tonight we finished watching Django Unchanged (silent D) on DVD from NetFlix. Originally a pretty exciting movie...had us on the edge of our seat at first. It degenerated into a cartoon version of the antebellum south, with blood spatters like they came from a fire hose, with all blacks good, all whites degenerate sadists.""

I will add if this movie depicted all whites good, all blacks degenerate sadists, it would have been denounced as blatant racism by the news media and talk shows for weeks, with cries for more laws to prevent other films like this from being made. How did we get on this one-way street, anyway? Martin Luther King said in 1963, ""I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.""

A good starting point nowadays to realize King's dream is to recognize that racism is a two way street, and not a means to a political goal.",1370563200,,1126,4.482926829268293

Lots of tongue-in-cheek humor and homage, great cameos by people like Michael Parks, and first-rate performances by Foxx and especially Christopher Waltz, who deserved his Oscar for it. Tarantino shows up and his cameo is blown, well, all out of proportion compared to other movies (yes, a small joke). Over-the-top violence as usual, but almost comic in most cases.

5259998,5,B00947NAHU,"Taratino and I have a strange relationship.  He generally profoundly annoys me with his obvious arrogance and unnecessary pretentiousness.  And winning the Oscar for the screenplay here didn't exactly help matters. :0)

But I cannot deny the man makes wooooooooooooooooonderful films!!!! Django Unchained is no exception and ranks right up there with the likes of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Death Proof, Jackie Brown and few others I liked.

This is slavery from the Tarantino perspective and, oooooohyes.....it works....

It is bloody and witty and fun and well-written complete with the (requisite/necessary?) element of unabashed revenge against the whole institution of slavery, which I, an African-American viewer, had absolutely no problem with.  The film is filled with eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeex performances, i.e. Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Michael Parks and Christopher Waltz.  As a matter of fact the only question I have is not with the film itself but with the supporting Oscar win for Waltz.  While his performance was measured, wonderful, and his characterization as a whole was most positive, hands down the most sparkling performances were those of Di Caprio and Jackson.  Their scenes together were simply stunning.  And of course, every time Jackson opened his mouth, I lost it.  These two deeeeeefinitely need to do another project - off the HOOK!!

Nonetheless, a very good film that I hiiiiiiiiiiighly recommend that is indeed worthy of your movie library!",1370476800,,1476,5.453744493392071

5260001,3,B00947NAHU,"""Django Unchained"" is not a bad film, nor is it a good one. It's basically the same film Tarantino has regurgitated out ever since he made ""Jackie Brown"" when he decided to create films emulating specific past genres. I'm not talking about vague genres such as dramas and comedies, I mean specific ones from the 60s and 70s like the anti-western, revenge martial arts film, and the ""Dirty Dozen"" war film, etc. Gone are the original days of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" instead Tarantino wants to show he can make films that extend the genre's at which they are initially created from. ""Jackie Brown,"" Kill Bill 1 and 2,"" ""Death Proof"" and ""Inglorious Basterds"" are all retreads of past genres, but Tarantino adds a bit of excessive stylization to each film that usually involves cartoonish violence and an extended film length. ""Django"" is no different in that Tarantino re-creates an anti-western film with (you guessed it) cartoonish violence and a long, overdrawn film length that could be 30-45 minutes shorter. Like all of Taranitino's films ""Django"" is entertaining, but only to a point. The dialogue is well written and the cinematography is nice, but the film still feels like a retread of past films. There are a few small original elements in ""Django"", but the film is not wholly original. DiCaprio and Waltz are the acting highlights, while Foxx basically portrays a single mood and emotion throughout most of the film which overstays it's welcome. The ending was drawn out and predictable, it felt a lot like the ending of ""Kill Bill part 2."" I look forward to the day Tarantino decides to make an original film again, and not try to follow in the footsteps created by the fathers of past film genres.

There are no socially redeeming qualities in this movie whatsoever.  As a matter of fact, there will probably white people who will be killed because of the racist anger that will be stoked by this movie.  In a just world, Tarantino would be tortured, put to death in a slow, tormenting way, and then burn in hell for all eternity as an accomplice to inciting murder and mahem.

5260026,1,B00947NAHU,"I will say this: Tarantino DOES know how to provoke an audience: Jaime Foxx is someone I've long admired from his ""Living Color"" days thru his exceptional portrayal of Ray Charles.  Tarantino could do a movie about the Twelve Disciples, and by the end, you'd be wanting to take a shot at all of them.  And Christopher Waltz?  I have NEVER - not even viewing movies about Hitler or Manson - wanted to see a character just DIE, slowly & painfully - which, I guess, was Tarantino's intention.  Same with the character Leonardo DiCaprio portrayed.  And maybe getting Samuel Jackson to do the ""yassuh-nosuh""-home slave was a total insult - or a testament to Jackson's worth as an supreme actor.  But for those ""yankees"" of you reading this, dig: I am a PROUDLY  SOUTHERN BOY - and while we Southerners might have ""had slaves"" (MY family certainly didn't - they came over with Oglethorpe) they were NOT beat mercilessly or used as sexual relief.  Think about it, libbos - if a person paid money for another man's services, they certainly WEREN'T going to spend time beating on them.  Remember the character, ""Mammy"" in ""Gone With The Wind?"" (I can hear you chanting ""I am woman hear me roar..."") THAT Lady ran the household while Miz Skalett was busy running around collecting & disposing husbands.  ""Antidote to Gone With The Wind?""

For a nearly three-hour motion picture, it kept me consistently entertained. Sure there were some slow spots, but what followed was either a great exchange of dialogue and/or a grand-scale scene of hilariously graphic violence (both are trademarks of Tarentino). Django's character may not be as engaging as one would hope, but the characters surrounding him are engaging to the point where Django is uniformly identified with them. Christoph Waltz is fantastic, but Samuel L. Jackson steals the movie! This movie is definitely not for everyone.

'Django Unchained' does have some similarities from its predecessor, but there is no challenge to look beyond that and just enjoy this hysterical and intense romp. I did however feel that at some point there was a lull and wonder why a whole part of the story was there because I felt that the film could have ended and that it was not needed. Then all I had to do was wait until the end and just enjoy and I was left satisfied. This movie like all of Tarentino's work is great. Fun and completely out of control. Perhaps maybe for Robert Rodriguez and Edgar Wright there is not a single director out there quite like this guy. It was nice to also see him get some credit for his work by receiving the Oscar for best original screen play, as it was deserved.

This is a fun movie and I am sure there are people out there that like it more than me, but when it comes to this film as well as the whole Tarentino library, 'Django Unchained' is an awesome addition to the collection.",1370044800,,1367,4.315175097276264

5260059,4,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino has never been one to shy away from controversy. From his first film RESERVOIR DOGS he jumped into film making head first, creating films he wanted to see and that apparently the rest of the world has too. The best part of this has been the fact that in doing so he's created some of the most original films around. Such is the case with his newest film, what many thought was a remake of the classic Franco Nero spaghetti western (he even does a cameo here) but is something altogether different.

DJANGO UNCHAINED starts off with the excessive bloodshed that Tarantino fans have come to know. Taking place shortly before the Civil War, Dr. King Schultz (Chritoph Waltz) is a traveling dentist who comes across two hunters transporting a group of runaway slaves back to the south. After enquiring about purchasing one to a negative response, he shoots one and wounds the other then ""purchases"" the slave, a man named Django (Jamie Foxx).

It seems that Schultz has actually given up the practice of dentistry and now makes a living as a bounty hunter. His reason for seeking out Django is that he can identify the men Schultz is currently seeking, high money bounties that will serve his pocketbook. In return for his help he tells Django he will pay him and give him his freedom. When Django tells him his story and how he wants to search for his wife who was sold Schultz agrees to help him with that as well.

When Django tells him his story and how he wants to search for his wife who was sold Schultz agrees to help him with that as well if they can continue on earning enough money before hand. The two travel across the country seeking out the bad guys who seem to pay well for their capture, dead or alive. Along the way the become friends and Schultz teaches Django the tools of the trade to the point where Django becomes one of the fastest guns around.

A year passes and eventually the pair track down the men Schultz was searching for to begin with. They collect their bounty and then put into motion the plan it will take to not only find Django's wife but to get her back again. She's been sold to one of the worst plantations in the south, a place known as Candyland and owned by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DeCaprio). Candie is a man Schultz realizes will not be interested in just selling Django's wife. Instead they will have to con him into inviting them to his home and finding a way to get him to want to sell her.

The plan goes along fine until Stephen (Samuel Jackson), Candie's house slave, begins to think something is up. With his advising Candie the question of whether or not Django will be reunited with his wife or end up once more a slave comes into question.

With a hot topic like slavery it becomes apparent where the controversy Tarantino arrived from. Depictions of somewhat historically accurate moments in history that many would like to forget are on display in living color. Whippings, dogs turned loose on slaves, branding and more are there for all to see. It does make you feel uncomfortable to watch but at the same time is an effective way to build an understanding of the character of Django and why he acts and does the things he does.

What seemed to garner more press was the use of the ""n"" word throughout the film. Yes, it truly is a despicable word to be tossed around freely but then again you have to understand that this is a film set in a period of time when it was commonly used and not in the most flattering ways. This was the language used at the time and can be seen not only used by the slave owners but the slaves themselves. Tarantino's decision to use it here seems more realistic than if something had been used in its place. In so doing the vulgarity and ugliness of the word become apparent.

This is one of Tarantino's better films. There rarely seems a time when you find yourself checking your watch to see if it's over or not. The acting is tremendous here with each actor so enmeshed in their characters that you actually believe they are who they are portraying. Over the top scenes seem natural for some of these characters, especially those involving DeCaprio.

DJANGO UNCHAINED may not be a film for everyone, but those less sensitive and fans of Tarantino will not walk away unhappy. Instead they'll be pleased to see he's made another film that may cause plenty of talk around the table but at least isn't the usual film to come out of Hollywood.",1369958400,,4442,4.480840543881335

I don't recommend this movie for those with a quesy stomach, or for those who are easily offended by foul language; but if you like a great western, and are able to get past the violence and the language-whether you are black, white, or a pink elephant with purple polka dotrs, then you want to see this movie.

5260088,2,B00947NAHU,"I have to start with this because of the number of responses I am seeing to reviews that are along the lines of ""well, obviously you've never seen a QT movie or you'd know better."" So let me state, right off the bat, I have seen QT movies - a lot of them. I have even liked them back when he actually made GOOD movies. Yes, he likes his blood spatter, dramatic effects and his cameo. I'm cool with all of that. I am cool with the violence, I am cool with the language. I've never really understood the current-day freak out over ""that"" word anyways. I have to say ""that word"" since Amazon won't even let me quote it without censoring. But I digress.
What I DIDN'T like about this movie was the reverse-racism, self-hating, PC, illogical, sexist, nonsensical b**ls*** that this movie portrayed. How did I hate it? Let me count the ways:
1. Kelly Washington maybe advertised as a main character but she's complete fluff. She pops up occasionally to be Django's imaginary wife, wave at him and vanish. And then, when she is there, she cries, faints and needs rescuing a lot.
2. While I don't mind violence in general, and I get the QT was trying to give us a sense of the horrors of black slavery, he botched. Badly. I don't care how much money you have. If you shell out the equivalent of the price of a new car it doesn't start on the third day, you DON'T take a sledge hammer to it. Not a very PC thought I know, but since the scene with the dogs was done entirely to give us the ""white man bad"" take, they least they could have done was made it believable instead of just gross. Sadly, buying his winning fighter a beer was probably more accurate in that scene. Where are the fields and the lousy living conditions that were the ACTUAL issues with slavery? Where is the heat, the exhaustion and the overseers making those marks that Django wears? True, these are less flashy than Mandingo fighting but much more insidious issues in the time period.
3. For that matter, if ""white man bad"" than why do they seem to do very little to their black ""slaves"" other than say ni... oops, I mean, ""that word"" a lot? Aside from the flashback people and actual slavers who die nasty deaths anyways the whites don't seem very bad - just not very bright. Otherwise blacks curse at their ""masters"" a lot, giggle and flirt and well, DON'T act oppressed. Except the crying, waiting for rescue Kelly Washington anyways. Hell, on the way back from the funeral they are all linking elbows despite color differences!
4. White hating: Calvin Candie who is the BIG bad guy mainly takes sass from his ""slaves,"" has the audacity to get pissed off that guests in his house were looking to screw him (think ""screw"" will get censored?"") and then gets shot for insisting on being treated courteously. Stephen is portrayed as a horrible man for being loyal and for being filled with grief when the young man he has raised since infancy is shot in front of him. Miss Laura is blown out a doorway, apparently for the sole reason that she's white - or maybe because she's related to Candie. Django, on the other hand, is given the moral freedom to kill anyone he wants to, whether they are law abiding or not, innocent or not, as long as they're white. At least Schultz - as the token ""okay"" white guy - had a moral code as a bounty hunter though Django seems to have learned all the wrong lessons from him.
5. If one more person refers to this as ""history"" I may scream.

I'm sure there's more, but I'm getting writer's cramp at this point. Short form, the movie started out good and got real bad, real fast. And no, being directed by Tarantino does not excuse or make up for that.",1369785600,,3650,4.399408284023669

5260104,4,B00947NAHU,"The comedy writer Julius Sharpe said on Twitter the other day that he just wanted to 'thank all the people who reviewed ""Star Wars"" on Netflix. You guys swayed me, I'll check it out.' He has a point, and it could save us all a whole lot of time. 'Django Unchained' is already a hugely popular movie, and so many, even among those who haven't seen it, are familiar by now with its fairly simple plot. So this time around, I'm only going to point out a few marked ways in which Quentin's seventh film struck me as rather unTarantinian.

'Django', of course, is still very obviously a Tarantino film. But look, for instance, at how the flash-backs are done with quick fades rather than simple cuts, and how they're shot with different filters - 'flash-back' filters. This drains them of most of the immediacy of the flash-backs of his other movies. Or, more accurately, they make them actually feel like flash-backs; the equivalents in his other films were effectively just scene transitions. He also uses music rather flamboyantly this time, often using only small parts of songs, and he uses more of it than usual.

The camera is also much more active than in previous films. Look at the often flashy way he films the lengthy scene at Candie's dinner table and compare it to the tavern scene in chapter four of 'Inglourious Basterds'. In that fifteen-minute scene, the camera is resolutely static throughout, using simple two-shots, three-shots and close-ups. For my money, this helped to make the scene quite considerably more immersive and suspenseful than the one at Candie's dinner table.

Compare also the realism of the nazis and peripheral characters in 'Basterds' with the slave-owners and townsfolk in 'Django', who are consistently exaggerated and frequently played for laughs. For myself, I was a bit disappointed by this decline in realism. Now, I know Tarantino did this to retain much of the feel of the Spaghetti Westerns he's always loved so much. But one of his greatest strengths has always been his talent for taking lesser genres and accentuating their best elements, while omitting their weaker ones. For most of his movies, this has included maintaining strict realism in the story's environments and supporting characters, but not so much in 'Django""s case.

Because of its content, the story it tells and its central characters and performances, 'Django' is an excellent, classical tale of a film. It has a couple of plot twists that are stunning. I am told that the Samurai sword-fight sequence in 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is probably the best ever filmed, and I have no doubt that 'Django""s revolver melee is as good a one as we're ever likely to see. But to an extent that surprised me, the movie lacks the definition of the rest of Quentin's films. I think there are three main reasons for this.

First, the story is that of a journey, an adventure, and has a fairly set path its makers must follow. Tarantino's stories usually move wherever and whenever they want to, but in each place they visit, they tend strongly to sit firmly down and stay there a good while. 'Django' is more fluid and, except for Candyland, moves through its locales rather speedily.

The second reason is that after 'Inglourious Basterds', his most restrained and static film yet, I believe Tarantino felt a need to have more fun making his next film, use more music, more comedy (I don't know how long it's been since I've laughed in a theatre as hard as I did when Quentin gets himself blown to smithereens), be more dynamic with his camera, and to finally fully indulge his love of Spaghetti Westerns, a desire which until now he's had to satisfy only in bits and pieces. This is all fine. But I think he set to work with less restraint than was strictly wise this time.

The third reason is that his editor Sally Menke died a year or so before production began on the film. Sally had edited all of Quentin's films and had long been known as his greatest collaborator. I realize now that such a loss does have its effect on a film. And her replacement, though he was an assistant in the editing of the Kill Bill movies, may not have been an ideal choice.

I point these things out because so few critics seem to have talked about them, and because together they work to produce a film with fewer marks of its director's craft and brilliance. Obviously 'Django Unchained' is a very strong and enjoyable film with numerous virtues, which delves fearlessly into a subject that's been so widely and wrongly ignored for so long that it now seems in real danger of being largely unknown to many of us. Consider the nauseating case of Arkansas Representative Jon Hubbard who, in a book published last year, wrote that 'The institution of slavery that the black race has long believed to be an abomination upon its people may actually have been a blessing in disguise', since the slaves would eventually be given full citizenship. So no harm done, I guess.

Watching it, we can sense that this project was one of those dearest to its director's heart. Quentin spoke with bafflement about the unyielding reluctance of the film industry, and of society at large, to discuss or confront the terrors of thralldom. He said of his movie, 'Let this be the first stone through the window.'",1369699200,,5273,4.7228260869565215

I don't know how to describe this movie, but it was entertaining and good. So, considering this is probably what Tarantino wanted, good on him.

Acting is pretty good. Waltz is charming as usual, but he always strikes me as playing the exact same neurotic character in every movie.

If you like Kill Bill, you'll probably like this. If you hated Kill Bill, you probably won't like this. It's very much the same exact concept.

POTENTIAL SPOILERS -
Django follows the exact same flow as Kill Bill (reasons for revenge established, let's make a list of who we need to kill and do it) in the beginning, then adds on the 'finding Kerry Washington' story.

It's good, not ground-breaking. I enjoyed it, but I still feel ambivalent. It was a good action (and yes, gorey) romp, but not awe-inspiring.

I can imagine old Quentin saying, ""That's What I Love About Tarantino Fans: I Get Older, They Stay The Same Age"". I'm sorry, but I can't imagine anyone over the age of fifteen liking this film. Hell, I can't even imagine anyone who knows a thing or two about cinema liking this film. Django Unchained was obviously made for little children who can't achieve any sort of stimulation without hip dialogue, ultra violence, and some sort of hoity-toity 'cool factor'. Tarantino gets more and more pathetic with each and every new film he is involved with. The man is 50 years old, and he has never EVER made a film reflective of himself, his fears, loves, or his passions. He has never once made any sort of attempt at making a personal film, he is still desperately clutching onto a 'cool factor' he once had 20 years ago, and the whole charade seems ultimately sad and pretty embarrassing.

When Pulp Fiction was released, he excited the entire planet, and revitalized American film. What happened to that guy? Because surely the director that made Pulp Fiction and the director that made Django Unchained must be two separate people. One guy obviously loved movies and defined himself through the art that he admired, while the other one seems to only be interested in perpetuating a self made myth about himself, further destroying modern film, and draining the life out of nearly everything in reach, all for the sake of 'cool'.

5260184,1,B00947NAHU,"I've enjoyed a few of QT's films. He has an ear for music and dialog and has used those elements well several times. That said, if the unexpected use of the ""N""-word worked successfully in ""Pulp Fiction"", it doesn't necessarily follow that endless use of bad language will guarantee a good script. If slavery is bad, then the proper response must be to shoot every white in sight and feel good about it. Apparently you have to go to Europe to find a worthy white person even if he is a dead-or-deader bounty hunter. A slave owner in the antebellum South might not be a bad person. But if you indicate that he likes to see black slaves fight to the death, your dumb audience can see where you're going.

For example the hero of the film is a German dentist (Christoph Waltz - won an oscar by the way) who sacrifices himself because of his hatred of slavery.  In a town where German's aren't necessarily appraciated, Tarantino was making a risky statement.  Tarantino is both an entertaining and courageous film maker.

I grew up in California,  in my community I wherely heard it. And usually if I did hear it, it didn't have the racial edge to it like it does in the movie.

The original tunes, specifically the lyrics, are so embarrassingly bad that they're kinda/sorta good: We were cracking up while the opening tune played.  The movie is way too long and the middle bogs down for reasons only known to Tarantino. The action is goofy, the gore over the top to the point where it doesn't even gross you out.  The actors all put in credible work, but the plot is so predictable, almost from the first two minutes.  Pulp Fiction is one of my all-time favorite flicks.  This is NOT that movie, or even close, when it comes to its entertainment value. If you're a big QT fan, you'll like it.",1369094400,,718,4.416666666666667
5260210,3,B00947NAHU,"In `Django Unchained' Quentin Tarantino continues to fictionalise history, as he did so successfully in `Inglorious B's'. Here he brings his violent comic-book style of film making to the period of black plantation-slavery in the pre-civil war southern states of the US.

Essentially DU is a fantasy-revenge western containing all the clichs of that genre as written by Sergio Leone in the 1960s. The screenplay is an amalgam of `Kill Bill' (the relentless repetitive splattering of enemies one by one, and sometimes 10 by 10) and IB (the fantasy revenge of a persecuted minority on their evil-cartoon-cut-out oppressors). As such its target audience is more likely to be juvenile and sensation-seeking than mature and sophisticated.

The saving grace of all Tarantino's films is the witty and clever dialogue, which here (unlike the action and basic plot) is anything but formulaic and continues to entertain throughout. The excellent Christoph Waltz trumps even his stellar appearance as the Nazi villain in IB to deliver a second Oscar-winning performance as King Schultz, the catalyst who holds the story together and drives the action for all but the final reel. Waltz's dialogue is witty, original, clich-free; delivered with a rare commanding intelligence and perfect timing. Leonardo DiCaprio turns in yet another outstanding character performance as the monstrous white racist and slave-owner Calvin J. Candie, Schultz's ultimate nemesis. Considering the restrictions of his dialogue Jamie Foxx is just OK but simply doesn't have the screen presence of for example Clint Eastwood in the `Dollars' movies to which DU pays homage; Samuel L. Jackson however shines in a difficult role as smart, sycophantic house slave Stephen inexplicably devoted to Candie. The only disappointment among the main characters is Kerry Washington as Django's enslaved and long-suffering wife Broomhilda. In place of the strong ballsy character full of defiance and witty dialogue that she might have been she instead just whimpers, whines and suffers causing the audience to wonder what on Earth does Django see in her?

The mostly clever script however does not rescue the film from the usual Tarantino excess. Unable to resist the temptation to titillate the juvenile sensibilities of his target audience and instead offer the audience any deeper perspectives on slavery, almost every sentence of dialogue for the whole 165 minutes is sprinkled with the `n' & `f' words. The ketchup-splatter violence gets to be - well just dull, actually. It's overdone to the point of pastiche, so anaesthetises its audience to the degree that all impact is lost. Tarantino needs to mature as a film maker and realise that if a measure of profanity in the right place adds to the power of a script and occasional acts of violence can hook the audience, then relentless repetition actually diminishes the viewing experience and can cause any mature thinking audience (with a mental age above 12) to lose interest and switch off.

So overall just OK: good dialogue and screenwriting with some exemplary acting performances, but ultimately marred by plastic, splatter-cartoon violence, almost ubiquitous unsophisticated racial stereotyping, little attempt at historical accuracy and as a film, lacking in serious substance. This is a shame, as the result could have been so much better. But hey, you may say, at the end of the day it's just schlock entertainment and fantasy fulfilment, not meant to be real - which is true.",1369094400,4,3496,5.271095152603231

Where is the entertainment value unless you're a masochistic psychopath. Big money is always spent on these film and are often used for propaganda or to accomplish subtle objectives. The objective of this film I think would be to lessen the sacredness of life, create division among peoples and desensitize people to violence. If the ultimate objective is to control a population this film goes a long way toward that objective.

I liked it so much I purchased the dvd when it released and have watched it a couple of times so far.  The acting is incredible; Fox, Waltz & DiCaprio all give amazing performances, so equally strong that it's clear why this is such an amazing film.  It IS violent but the story is humorous, humane (you will want the guys that are killed to meet that fate) and throughly entertaining.  I bet you will like it, too!",1368921600,,646,4.17741935483871

And one of his trademarks is violence so over-the-top that it's entertaining (as long as you don't take it too seriously).  His movies are also generally clever, and have memorable dialogue.  This movie is all of those things.  I deducted a star for DiCaprio's awful southern accent.",1368921600,,417,5.0

I'm an action movie guy who does look for some period scenery and costumes in a flick as well .Django Unchained has it all .The movie takes me back to some of the old spaghetti  westerns of the late 60s and early 70s that I enjoyed.

Kristoph Waltz is a cold-blooded bounty hunter in some scenes but patiently recounts childhood fairy tales and offers remedial reading lessons in others. The costumery rivals a bad drag show and the ""homage"" to Italian ""spaghetti westerns"" is pretentious. And of course there is the violence but in this film it's all spaghettied-up in massive explosions of candy apple red and ""thick as paint"" blood. The real surprise is DiCaprio. He did a nice job.

That Quentin - a genius no doubt and with a view that is great entertainment.  Makes me think of ""through a glass darkly"" or something like that.

To see the evil slave traders and the overseers treated the way they deserved - great.  Don Johnson is surprisingly good in his spoof as ""Big Daddy"".  Overall if Quentin's name is on it - buy it.",1368835200,,510,4.195876288659794

It's not a bad film with poor acting; on the contrary, it is a descent film with good acting all around. However, I thought the story would be better. It got somewhat ridiculous at times with over-the-top gun fights that took me out of the movie at times.

So, if you want to kill a couple of hours and don't care either way if what you're watching is a top-caliber film, then you'll enjoy this one. After all, it's ""okay"".",1368748800,,561,4.242990654205608

This movie is full of action, comedy, retribution and a story of undying love one would die for. Jamie Foxx make a great cowboy, I would love to see him do more westerns. Leanardo DiCaprio played his part so well that it made me want to hate his character. It does get bloody in many parts of the movie, not for kids. I was a little dissapointed in the very end, the horse pracing and circles was a little cheesy. Considering that they are still in the deep south and just blew up a plantation and killed a lot of people, you'd think getting the heck out of there would be more important than impressing his wife with horse tricks.

Tarantino can't balance his brilliance around operatic violence with big spaces. He gets overwhelmed. Concretely, this movie reminded me how much Tarantino excels in tight, urban environments. Give him claustrophobia and he's happy as a pig in mud. Slopping around slap-happy, yet usually smart as a whip. But give him big vistas like the American west or even the south and his story telling, indeed entire energy, gets lost. His work looks puny. His actors are diminished. And the stories ring as hollow.  Rather than resonating with big comic book genius they become small comic book drek. This movie had moments that captured the vile nature of slavery.

It's a standard western with lots of flash and raw, basic emotions on display. Christof Waltz sort of makes the movie worth watching so kudos to Quentin for writing that part.

There was some kind of explosive drama every few minutes.  The thing that bothers me is that I feel a show like this about a subject as touchy as slavery, and with the way it was portrayed, can only cause a certain facet of either race to become enraged.  Slavery was wrong, no doubt about it, but we made our mistakes and now have tried to right the wrongs that generations before committed.  We're trying to move ahead and become a community of people who can coexist.  This subject matter has been addressed plenty of times before, only to create even more racial tension.  I believe we've made amends.  We have a black president, don't we?  When you really assess a movie, you usually have to address how you feel afterward.  I say again, I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, the music, and the scenery, but was somewhat insulted that every white American in the show was demonized.",1368576000,,1047,4.463157894736842

This movie intrigues the socially aware and somehow seems reflective of today's social upheaval, although I pray we don't come to such extreme violence. With that said however, I think every human has potential for such aberrant behaviors.

DiCaprio does a wonderful job as your stereo-typical plantation/slave owner and Sam Jackson turns in fine performance as the totally owned house boy.  This is not Tarantino's best work.

5260321,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest directors working in the movie industry. Django Unchained manages to tell a great story, have a big heart, show the absolute inhumanity and brutality of slavery in pre-civil war United States, be brutally violent, and hysterically funny all at the same time. The combination of all those elements while paying homage to spaghetti westerns and 70s style film making with Tarantinos uniquely modern flair is nothing short of amazing. Django Unchained is like the most spectacular house of cards you have ever seen, one slight miscalculation could topple the entire thing but instead it stands strong and is a must see for any movie lover.

Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave in 1858 America. Early on in the film Django crosses paths with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). Schultz is an out of practice dentist turned bounty hunter who originally recruits Djangos help for a single job. Schultz makes it clear he despises slavery and quickly forms a bond with Django. Schultz takes an interest in Djangos goal to rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who was cruelly separated from him. Django and Schultz spend a winter together hunting bounties and making a good deal of money. Django takes to the bounty hunting trade and gun slinging naturally. Schultz discovers that Broomhilda is being held at an infamously cruel plantation known as Candie-Land under the slaver Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).

Django Unchained is a fictional story but seems to take place in a very real world. The brutality and widespread of slavery in the early United States is crystal clear all throughout the movie. Every actor in the film does a flawless job of getting the audience up to speed with the general mentality and racial structures in the time period. The abundant racism and cruelty toward the slaves is, at times, almost difficult to watch but it is never overdone or unnecessary. A lot of prejudgements and accusations have been thrown around because of the sensitive material and racist elements. This movie is in no way racist. It tells a story during one of Americas more shameful moments and does so without pulling its punches. The slavery and racist aspect of Django Unchained is also only one aspect of a phenomenal film. On top of the brutal realism and historical aspects is a story about a man willing to do anything for the love of his love. Intertwined to the great, though somewhat unconventional love story, is a fantastic story about two people who could not be anymore different finding common ground and forming a strong friendship. Dress all these elements up with some hilarious moments and amazing action sequences and Tarantino may have produced his best work yet, thats really saying something.

Jamie Foxx plays the titular hero in this Western-action-homage. Soft spoken and closed off for the majority of the movie Foxx plays Django from the inside out. Much of the characters understanding and development is told in his face, and especially his eyes. It is completely believable that Django lived a hard life and the audience never has reason to question the actors commitment to the role. There is never doubt that Django lived through his past traumas or that his blood wasn't actually boiling during some very tense situations. Foxx is an actor who could have easily made a career out of soft roles and phoned in performances but he is constantly trying new things and succeeding immensely. Christoph Waltz first worked with Tarantino in 2009s Inglorious Basterds. This was also his introduction to the majority of the Hollywood audience. Waltz absolutely stole the movie and outperformed all of his costars despite being virtually unknown to American audiences and playing the main antagonist. Waltzs performance is equally impressive in Django, he is quick witted and very funny. Waltz as an actor has an air and charm about him that says he knows something that those around him dont. He carries scenes effortlessly whether he is merely sitting at a table in dialogue or running a wild west type shoot-out. The dialogue he was given as the Dentist turned Bounty Hunter is perfect and Waltz sells the delivery of every single line, no matter how small it may seem. The only actor who may have out-done him ever so slightly is DiCaprio. DiCaprio has been one of the movie industrys greatest actors since he was a kid. Constantly blowing away expectations and steering clear of being type cast of thrown into cash-grab quality projects it isn't a surprise DiCaprio did well. What was surprising is that the actor took the role at all. The role was absolutely a good one but Calvin Candie is a straight up monster. DiCaprio has never played a character so repulsive and evil down to his core. Another complete shock in casting was Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen. Stephen is essentially Candies estate manager and top tier slave. The two banter as equals and Stephen seems to hold a power over Candies other slaves. Jackson who has proven in the past to be a solid actor lately has been a little lazy in many parts he has played. Choosing to simply play himself in a costume rather than really challenge himself. In Django, Jackson really pulled out all the stops along with the rest of the cast and did something no one has seen him do before.

Django is shot so beautifully. In true Western fashion there are plenty of sprawling scenery shots and very nice establishing shots. The camera is never irritating and shots are set up so well that the audience can be totally immersed in the rest of the movie. The most amazing stylistic approach to how this was shot is that despite it being a top quality gorgeous movie it never loses its Tarantino flair. Fast zooms, interesting angles, and almost a 70s style feel are applied all throughout the movie in a perfect balance with new film trends and technologies. The soundtrack is equally good and equally as diverse. Music audiences would expect in a mid 1800s set movie is mixed in with classic rock, easy listening and modern rap. Combining the elements with the flawless sets, props and wardrobes must have been a tough mixture to pull off and Tarantino does it expertly.
From sitdown-shutup.net

Django Unchained is a movie with a little bit of everything. Quality cinematography, acting, directing and writing all come together to form a perfect historical action movie with a huge heart. This is certainly unlike anything Quentin Tarantino has ever done while still having all the familiarities Tarantino fans have grown to love. It is safe to say this is the directors best work despite his very impressive resume. Hopefully Django is a sign of more great things to come not only from the director but also from the entire cast. More movies need to be as bold and more actors need to tackle roles they are not as used to being put in. The challenge clearly produces astounding results. It is no question why Django Unchained is a 2012 Best Picture nomination.",1368489600,,6987,4.868067226890756

5260331,3,B00947NAHU,"... and I didn't feel roused to smack the head of the nearest racist. That comment could stand as my whole review, but I suppose I'd better clarify.

Okay, it's a cartoon, complete with the usual transformation of a weakling into a super-hero. Monsieur Candie (DiCaprio) is The Joker. Django (Foxx) is Batman, Spiderman, or whomever you wanted to emulate when you were twelve. But, as a comic book, it drags. It's twenty minutes too long.

Or, if you like, it's revved-up social history. But in that case it's thin on significant details. Why, for instance, is there no cotton growing on the Candie Plantation? No work gangs? None of the true horrors of slavery in the purported year 1858? The indifference to plausibility began to annoy me in the first few minutes: why on earth is a coffle of slaves being marched through the barren rocks of the far West? You don't need to cross West Texas to get to East Texas! Yeah, yeah, back to the cartoonish essence of the film. What's the point of griping about the lack of verisimilitude in a cartoon?

Mind you, I can relish the vicarious thrill of blowing away a couple dozen slave drivers and slave traders, just as I relished the climax of Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, when the whole Nazi high command was machine-gunned in a theater. As a twelve-year-old I had my share of such fantasies. And as a mature (ha!) American, I simmer with rage against the slavers and racists of ""our"" history. An indomitable African-American revenging the villainies of the White USA? Good stuff! A cartoon version of the election and re-election of Barack Obama, which excited the billy-hell out of me. Strangely, this story isn't simple enough - not black and white enough - for a cartoon, not with the second-nastiest character (played by Samuel Jackson) being a virulently racist slave and male nanny to the planter Candie. The film sags from righteous empathetic mayhem against Bad Guys into commercial sadism.

Perhaps the best way to evaluate Django Unchained is to compare it with Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. IG was funny, suspenseful, sardonic, well-shaped and well-edited, yet had just as much gore on display for the kiddies. If five stars is appropriate for Inglourious Basterds, the three stars are plenty for Django Unchained.",1368489600,2,2288,4.919689119170984

For the life of me, I can't figure out why there was ever a controversy about this film.  Yes, lot's of use of the ""N""; word.

But this film was set front and center on the point in U.S. history when slavery was considered legal, and blacks were property.  Yes, a disgusting part of U.S. history... and yes, ""ni**er"" was widely used during that time.

Maybe the uproar was from whites that found it objectionable to use the ""N"" word... because that part of history, and seeing what that looked like on film, makes most humans uncomfortable.

But... you can't make past history go away just because it makes you uncomfortable.  Besides, this movie isn't all about that... it is set in the period, and is kitschy and fun... and has a great angle on the age old tension between Good and Evil.",1368489600,,817,4.47972972972973

To another scene, and again, ""Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah,"" and then follow by extreme violence. If you look at most of his recent movies, they are kinda linear and violent, nothing more, nothing less. But I will say this, Django makes you want to keep watching hoping that something extraordinary is going to happen. Well, it didn't. It has never had, not since Kill Bill's surprise ending, anyway. As for violence, I thought it is carefully crafted and not gross -- and, in some occasions, comical. So, decent movie but disappointing.

Though this movie is visually stunning, the storyline is so-so and uninspired, the use of the ""N"" word every five seconds is only done for shock value. The music is taken from classic movies that everyone should be watching instead of this. The use of Jim Croce's ""I've Got A Name"" is hilariously and unintentionally comical and reminiscent of a road/buddy movie. The lynch mob ""bag"" scene where they portray them as bumbling buffoons, while deserved, is at best, hokey and eye-roll inducing. In other words, this movie doesn't have an original idea and is totally predictable.

I know on Amazon you can download to an approved device and watch in HD but I did not want to do that as I wanted to watch on my big apple monitor and thought this would be quicker.

Revised-I spoke with Amazon and they refunded my purchase price. They suggested restarting router etc., but am in a hotel and that isn't an option. They say it was more than likely on the hotels end.",1368403200,,669,4.2265625

5260373,3,B00947NAHU,"I used to like Quentin Tarantino's movie, Pulp Fiction, Desperado, then it started to get a little bit over the top and out of control. From the last three movies he made, Inglorious Bastards is the best. The story of Django Unchained is pretty simple and predictable with a few weird flaws. Unfortunately, the presentation of the story is the one that shut me down, especially for the last hour of the movie. The movie started out alright then it's getting really gory (which is unnessecary)and way too many curse words. The last hour is a torture when the main smart character who is so good in what he does became so bad in hiding his feeling from his expression, and finally also made a very bad decision caused by a small little thing (watch out for spoiler) such as a handshake. That just doesn't make sense. Then, it ended very badly and incredibly gory. It seems like that event ocured to open another chance for the director to show more dramatically gory and totally unrealistic action scene.

And then, they still add another good 20 minutes to end themovie with another super unrealistic shoot out scene and typically gory Tarantion's style action (and don't forget all the curse words and brutal mentality). Long story short, there are too much unnessecary ""dark things"" in them ovie with many unrealistic plot and action scene.

I still respect Tarantino as he is, that's why I give this movie 3 stars. Trust me, I got attached at the first half of the movie and the second half? I really can't wait for it to be over.

Two Academy Award winner and a few nomination? This is the very first time I don't agree with the nominations at all since 1998 may be. If you want a good western movie, there a lot better movies out there. If you want a great intriguing storyline, there a lot better ones out there, too. If you are a big fan of Tarantino or a very different kind of storytelling, then this is your movie.

For me? I'm sorry Tarantino, Pulp Fiction, Desperado, Reservoir Dog and Inglorious Bastard are my top four. The rest is very predictable typical Tarantino (Kill Bill, Kill Bill 2, Sukiyaki Western Django, this one,Death Proof)style.

Hope this helps.",1368316800,,2175,4.624352331606218

At this point the genre was reborn.  Unforgiven and Open Range, excellent westerns, came to us.  Now the master of borrowing things from other movies has brought us the ultimate Western.  Smart funny and bloody this movie will keep you both excited and also laughing out loud.  I'm not saying this movie is Mel Brooks funny but it has its moments due to extraordinarily clever performances by Christoph Waltz (it's his movie), Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio, chewing up the scenes in his first evil bastard role.

5260413,3,B00947NAHU,"There's no doubt that Tarantino peaked early with non-linear deep pulp ""Reservoir Dogs"" and one of the best movies in history ""Pulp Fiction"". So it's going to be an uphill battle for any follow-up, even nearly 20 years later.

Django Unchained (the ""d"" is silent"") tries hard to live up, and it's a good movie, but it's not as good as you hope. The problem is the linear nature of the film, Tarantino doesn't write three-act screenplays, he writs six-act ones.

The first part of Django covers the violent yet whimsical freeing of Django from a set of slave traders by Dr. Shultz (Christoph Waltz) on of Tarantino's finest characters and a purveyor of  brilliant and hysterical linguistics. He needs Django to ID a bounty for him so he offer's him freedom and a cut of the profit in return. Django quickly accepts and they two are off.

This could easily be the film, or at least Part-1 of a Kill Bill style epic. There's plenty to mine here as the ""n____r on a horse"" learns the game of kill and cash-out while being a black man in a time of slavery in the south riding a horse with a gun strapped to his hip. But that's not the story Tarantino is trying to tell. Too quickly he zooms past - so fast he uses a note at the bottom of the screen to tell us ""this and that happened, but this is a revenge story gone awry in the telling so we need to zoom past all the fun stuff that happened over the winter."" It's an unworthy device.

The second film find's Django and Shultz arriving at ""Candyland"" (yeah, it's funny) where they pose as slavers looking to buy a well-bred slave fighter for brutal, to-the-death entertainment. What they really want is to have Django's wife, a German speaking slave as an add-on to the deal. When the double-cross is exposed (they never planed on buying the fighter or more important, paying) the screen is filled with blood. Again, this in and of itself is a complete film's worth of plot. Django tends his wounds, plans his (awesome) revenge and rides to free his wife.

The end result is not so much epic as hurried. Tarantino should take his own playbook out and re-edit this to put the first splashy blood-soaked sequence first, once we establish which major characters die we can then proceed to tell the story forward to show the audience how we got there and omit the ""several months passed"" BS in the middle.

Is Django entertaining, Tarantino quality film? Yes. Is it as good as it should be, no.",1368144000,,2437,4.462921348314607

5260423,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino tactfully draws back the shade on the dark underbelly of America's great shame- slavery- and the result isn't easy to swallow. Django Unchained is an ugly, gruesome, ruthless film...and I loved every second of it.

The uncharacteristically chronological narrative follows the journey of ex-slave Django (Jamie Foxx) and his bounty hunting liberator (Christopher Waltz) as they attempt to free Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from twisted plantation owner and mandingo curator Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio.)

This splatterfest symphony has all the earmarks of a Tarantino film- flashy superimposed text, snappy dialogue, terse banter, larger than life characters and an emotional revenge narrative- but it uses the backdrop of the slave-ridden south to expose the nastiness of our nations past. The sad truth- this is pulp fact, not fiction.

While we can conjecture about the historical accuracy of the film, it's probably all more true than we'd like to admit. Tarantino sweeps the most unpalatable of human nature from under the rug and into our faces and we can't help but watch paralized. In an interesting juxtaposition to this years similarly-themed Lincoln, Django may not be the history lesson we want but it's probably the one we deserve.

Without the vast talent of its cast, Django may have fallen flat and lost its emotional oomph. Thankfully, every performer in this sprawling epic places their definitive stamp on their varied roles with great success.

Waltz is easily the highlight, not only of this film but of the entire year, as he chews up the scenes with masterful gusto. He has a mysterious way of making you listen to his each and every word, perfectly slung like the sweet-talking gunfighter he is. Waltz is the ideal vessel for Tarantino's trademark dialogue and their pairing is a perfect marriage we can hope to see prosper for many years to come.

Foxx plays the titular Django with swagger and style. He's a no-frills badass with a crystal clear motive and he executes his worthy mission with trigger-happy snark.

In a career first, DiCaprio assumes the role of the villain and is downright venomous.  A highlight of the film involves him and Waltz in a confrontation about a handshake that will be sure to leave you shaken and wowed.

And last but not least is Samuel L. Jackson, who hasn't been this good since his unforgettable turn as Jules in Tarantino's sophomore phenomenon- Pulp Fiction. This nasty-hearted head house-slave may not be spouting Ezekiel but his conniving ways are equally malicious and chill-inducing.

As should be expected, there are moments where Tarantino is overindulgent- I could have used about five minutes of riding horses through various landscapes and a couple unfitting musical numbers edited out- but it's all a part of a great and sprawling film that's not only highly stylized but injected with a urgent sense of purpose. Plus, has gangster rap ever played better in a feature film?

While it's not for the faint of heart- be prepared for torrents of blood and no short measure of the ""n-word""- Django Unchained is that rare masterpiece that will have you laughing out loud one moment and in jaw-dangling horror the next.

All the performers involved are hitting their mark with pitch perfect bravado and Tarantino once again proves that he's the king of cinema.",1368144000,,3365,5.087114337568058

5260428,4,B00947NAHU,"This was a good movie, not great, but good.  The acting was outstanding, but look who we're dealing with here!  If the acting was anything other than outstanding, we'd have a problem.  The script was good too, as in the lines that were spoken, and this is proving to be Tarantino's wheelhouse.

Not his best film, not even close, but you'll still get the shock value from a Tarantino film that you've come to love.  This film is made to model the spaghetti-westerns and it does a really good job of that; right down to the unrealistic gun fights.

I'll give this movie a 4 based on Leo Dicaprio's role in this movie alone.  At this point, I believe that dude is my favorite actor in hollywood.  This movie is average until he comes in and becomes truly Tarantino-esque from that point on.

--SPOILER--
My one complaint, though, and it is nagging at me, is why ON EARTH Dr. King Schultz would shoot Leo in the middle of his mansion knowing the amount of gun-hands that were on the plantation.  He was a really smart dude, the movie takes care to establish this, and yet he puts his (only?) friend, and his just acquired long-lost wife, in a crap-storm of blood and bullets by doing this and his excuse is ""Sorry, I just couldn't resist"" or something like that.  Just shake his hand, get out of there, and then come back and get your revenge.  I feel like this is lazy plot development/writing here because it was an easy way to create a huge gunfight and a SEEMINGLY more dramatic ending.",1368144000,,1487,4.446494464944649

Leonardo Dicaprio's performance in this film is truly astonishing! How he didn't win an Oscar for this incredible performance is shameful. As much as I love Christoph Waltz, and I really, really love the guy, Dicaprio should have won the the best supporting actor Oscar. His performance is that good. Waltz deserves it very much so, don't get me wrong, but Leo was simply amazing. Waltz was also in every sense of the word simply unforgettable, as was Don Johnson, Samuel Jackson, and numerous others. The acting in fact is impeccable by nearly the entire cast. No doubt Tarantino had something to do with this in great part. But as far as acting goes Leo's performance is the crowning jewel in this film. The first 3 times I saw this movie I wasn't totally convinced of that. In fact sometimes Tarantino movies really need to grow on you. You can't take it all in from just one sitting. Once it grows on you, like a fine wine, you can then begin to put all the pieces together and watch the beauty of it's lush vineyards blossom right in front of you. And I'm certain Leo is so damned good in this movie he has pretty much nearly stolen the show from Christoph even though his time on-screen is less than a third the time Christoph is onscreen, yet you can't help but notice how completely into his character he really is. It's almost scary at times. In fact during filming one scene Leo accidentally cut his hand open, but he never broke character and they just kept on shooting. That is pretty astonishing when you think about it. I was never a big fan of Leo's, but now Now I really am. So I've spent a little too much time singing praises for Leo, that I haven't really reviewed the movie. Well all I can say is that many other very well written reviews can take care of that, but I will say if you see Django Unchained and don't like it, see it several times then pass a judgement. The chance is pretty good you'll like it more and more the more times you see it. This movie is maybe QT's best film. Maybe even better than Pulp Fiction, dare I say.  By the time you see it 3 or 4 times it becomes clear your watching an masterpiece by any measure. It's truly a triumph for Tarantino. And as far as I am concerned easily by leaps and bounds the best film of the year. Though it lost the Oscar to Argo, and though Argo is an excellent movie, Django Unchained is much, much better.",1367884800,,2650,4.362348178137652

I watched this twice, and usually I don't do that, especially not within weeks of the first viewing, but the violence was a bit much, but that is QT.  I think it should have been made for younger audiences to enjoy because the overall message of the movie was damn good!

SPOILER ALERT:  I had to turn my head away from the boxing scenes and dogs tearing a person limb from limb, literally.  (How did Quentin Tarintino do that?  Did he get a body from the morgue?).  Other than that, I enjoyed the German fairytale of Bromhilde.  I enjoyed Jamie Foxx and Leonardo di Caprio.  This movie was Jamie Foxx's best performance!  And Leonardo's best performance as well. (I never would have guessed he had a bad guy in him.)

The story line is about the freeing and empowering of someone who was a slave during the time of slavery - very thought provoking and an innovative story line.  I've never come across anything like that before, not Roots, not Queen, not any movie or TV series.  Also, this is a story of friendship, loyalty, and love.

5260481,2,B00947NAHU,"Tedious. Hours of boredom punctuated by moments of light entertainment. How did Q. Tarantino get to be such a big deal? His sense of timing alone puts me off. His humor is juvenile and what he finds meaningful is absurd.

In one sequence, Django is separated from his long-lost wife for months or years and then decides to do a winter's worth of bounty hunting before going to rescue her. Meanwhile, she is probably being beaten and raped. He doesn't seem to care. Finally, he finds her. Then, unbelievably, he waits behind a door while the good doctor Schultz rambles on and on, pointlessly. The first delay is sort of forgivable, as we are only told about it. The second delay is maddening.

The ending does not honor the characters or pay off what has been set up. (SPOILER ALERT) For example, the formerly clever Dr. Schultz gets stupid and shoots Calvin Candie (stupid name, both for him and for Candyland) and then is shot by a minor character. Schultz has been the pivotal character, the lynchpin for the whole plot. Then boom, he is gone. No grand finale here. And his action violates the character. An opportunity for drama wasted.

Overall, this was a good idea for a movie--white bounty hunter rescues black man from slavery--but this movie is slow, stupid, and juvenile, a long slow form of torture.",1367798400,6,1311,4.691304347826087

I was glad to see him do a Cameo.  Superb directing, good story, great cast, fine sets and outdoor shots, and a variety of music ( I was partial to Morricone's).  My only slight complaint is the variety of music was kind of all over the place in style and period and to me made the movie slightly disjointed. Now I grant you much of the music in the 70s movies was similar, but I didn't like most of it either.  I wish Quintin Tarantino had given full control of the music to Ennio Morricone and let him run with it.  My bet is he would have come up with something like that in the three spaghetti Westerns soundtracks (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-The-Bad-The-Ugly/dp/B001G5VISQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good, The Bad & The Ugly</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-With-The-Harmonica-Soundtrack-from-the-film-Once-Upon-A-Time-in-the-West/dp/B00C9ZNQGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man With The Harmonica (Soundtrack from the film Once Upon A Time in the West)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Il-mio-nome-egrave-nessuno-mon-nom-est-personne-my-name-is-nobody-bande-originale-du-film-de-Tonino-Valerii-1973/dp/B005DN4YM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Il mio nome &egrave; nessuno - mon nom est personne - my name is nobody (bande originale du film de Tonino Valerii (1973))</a>) I mentioned and it would have been perfect and I would have given the movie five stars.

In interviews QT tries to dress up this dreck up with his philosophical musings on violence (which boils down to violence is cool), but he's just another gore-monger, smarter and more audacious and more creative than the rest, but ultimately just as vacuous. His dramatic solution is always more catsup.

With his pointed winks to exploitation genres of the past, he's saying ""I'm far too hip to take this stuff seriously,"" and the film critics buy his schtick.  Is it because they are hip to the film references and get to join Tarrentino in the cool boys' club?

You can't blame QT for wanting to make money and be the darling of filmland, but I do blame the critics and other ""intellectuals"" for giving him cover.  Those critics who still take this guy seriously, I'm betting will be hiding their embarrassment 20 years from now.",1367712000,36,1123,5.081521739130435

The movie is a fantasy, of course, but it contains more grit and heartbreak than any antebellum era picture I have ever seen.  The language is offensive to the ear, but compromising in that respect would have been even more offensive to the history portrayed therein.  The violence is lightened by the humor, which is delivered by an astonishing cast of actors giving Oscar-worthy performances.  My only complaint--and the reason I gave this Blu-ray package 4 stars rather than 5--is the the paucity of bonus material contained on the disc.  There are no deleted scenes, and there is no director's cut.  I realize QT doesn't really believe in the director's cut concept, but I have read interviews where he discussed some of the material that was left on the cutting room floor.  For example, the Zoe Bell character is a total mystery.  Something could have been added to inform the audience who she was any why she wears a mask.  Likewise, some of the men in Candie's retinue needed a hint of back story to explain their prominence on his plantation.  If that didn't make it into the film, it would have made a nice bonus feature.  Overall, an excellent movie but not the best package of movie and features.",1367712000,,1306,4.6347826086956525

It was also very nice to catch a look at Tom Savini, (special effects make-up artist). He is such a hottie and is a master of make-up and I truly admire his work and his acting shots.

Django Unchained (""the 'D' is silent"") is a plodding homage to the spaghetti westerns of yore that doesn't really get cooking until an hour in. There we go through the rabbit hole into a fantasy freakshow of toothless varmints, idyllic plantations, a coolly delicious villain, and, the best part, an unrecognizable Samuel L. Jackson as an impish Uncle Tom, who plays the same character in every movie, whether he's a superspy or a Jedi Knight, but his trash-talking street persona works here to great a effect.  The shootout(s) at the end are worth the wait, although it would have been more satisfying to just have one...but Tarantino just had to one-up Margaret Mitchell with a few sticks of dynamite.  One strange thing...it's still a white man who unchains Django, and in the end, it's a sell-out who ends up the real villain.

Tarantino's references to so many old westerns made for some really fun (and funny) moments.  Jamie Foxx is simply magnificent.  His transformation from fearful to powerful to unstoppable was so well done and really exciting.  Tarantino is right, they did use the 'N' word much more in that period.  Having lived in the south for many years, I found none of it too much.  I thought it was refreshingly honest.  The only unbelievable aspects for me were when Foxx's character was allowed into the 'big house' in a way that he would not have been unless the slave owners were much more sympathetic than DeCaprio's character.

5260513,4,B00947NAHU,"This story takes place in the late 1850's in the American West and South, where the German Dentist Dr. Schultz has discovered that bounty hunting is much more lucrative than his initial profession.  Over the course of pursuing his new professional interests, Dr. Schultz comes upon the slave Django, who is able to identify three desperados with significant bounties on their heads--as Django had the misfortune to have been personally acquainted with these miscreants.  With the usefulness of Django's personal background in mind, Dr. Schultz makes those conveying Django an offer they cannot refuse (in the truest sense), so that Django now finds himself in the good doctor's employ.

As Schultz inquires into his new employee's background, he discovers that poor Django has been separated from his beloved wife by the gross inequities of slavery.  As chance and coincidence would have it, Django's wife began her life as the personal servant of a German woman who saw fit to give her the name Brunhilda and teach her the German language.  Dr. Scultz finds this story of an African American woman with this German background very interesting, especially in that her name corresponds to that of a character enshrined in Teutonic music and myth.  Schultz goes on to tell Django the story of the courageous hero Siegfried who rescues his darling Brunhilda from an impregnable mountain guarded by a dragon.  I should note at this point that in such legends (including the Old English epic Beowulf) great treasures are often guarded by dragons.

And so Django and Schultz set out on their laudable mission to rescue Brunhilda from horrors of slavery in the ante-bellum American South.  They hatch a clever scheme, which naturally runs into certain difficulties.  As in all such dramas, of course, chance plays a large role in allowing the hero to succeed in his quest.  For my taste, however, chance plays too large a role in the plot of this movie.  I also take exception to one singularly capricious decision by usually cool-headed Dr. Schultz that seemed completely of character!.  Despite these two misgivings, however, I still enjoyed this movie and found it interesting!",1367625600,,2173,5.070224719101123

First of all ,I am not a huge Quentin Tarantion fan although I have seen some of his movies and they have been good. However, having said that, this one is in a category that can't be touched and I understand he developed and wrote the story line. Let me just say , the entire cast was wonderful but I felt Christoph Waltz was just incredible and I have never seen Jamie Foxx in this dramatic of a roll and he pulled it off with flying colors.

5260523,4,B00947NAHU,"Tarantino scripted a wonderful film. Great dialouge coupled with perfect casting. First rate acting by all. The only fault I would find is in the over the top shoot out scene in the films final half hour. Beyond that, it was a truly terrific film. Slavery is a difficult and sensitive issue. But I believe the film accuratly portrayed the true conditions that existed in certain parts of the pre-civil war South. DeCaprio's Calvin Candie represented and certainly was among the worst of the worst. Chritopher Waltz was ideal as Dr. King Schultz, what a great character. Jamie Foxx as Django - having just seen the film, I can't imagine anyone else playing the role, he owned it. A common criticism I've heard is that the film is overly, overtly bloody and graphic. I agree that it is very bloody, but I do not feel it gratuitous (other than the big final shoot out). I don't know why Tarantino felt the need to break away from ""reality"" in that scene after having spent the first 2 hours so wonderfully staying within its bounds. I would have been good with the scene if the body count had been 3,4 or even 8. But I lost track of how many ""bad guys"" Django killed (30???) before finally being captured. It just wasn't believable. And why do the bad guys always have to have such bad aim? I've never understood that. The hero can be standing alone in the middle of a room calmly picking off bad guys one by one with a dozen of them shooting at him and never hitting anything. Again, unbelievable.

And he tops it all off with a ridiculously cheesy ending. It's a shame Tarantino can't make a movie that's a little more concise, and that maintains the pace throughout...oh yeah, he did, in PULP FICTION. His best work ever, IMO.

5260540,5,B00947NAHU,"This movie is amazing, it has an amazing soundtrack, action scenes, dialouge, acting, scenery, and very funny at times, BUY IT.",1367539200,,127,5.095238095238095
5260541,3,B00947NAHU,"cast is excellent:  Jamie Fox, Christoph Waltz, Leo Dicaprio, Samuel L. Jackson.  There is also a part for Walton Goggins who plays  Boyd Crowder on Justified.  BTW--Christoph Waltz is a superstar actor in his prime--he scares you in the first five minutes of inglorious bastards by showing you the brutality of Nazi regime-- but you empathize with him in this movie--where he is guided by his conscious--very versatile actor.

Movie is vintage Quentin Tarantino--excellent dialog, plot, and movie flows great for most part--except it seems to drag on just a little too much and then the end feels crammed down a bit.

There is something else--that is not related to Tarantino or the actors--but more of present circumstances.  The movie has lots of shooting scenes and violence--not a big deal for me usually--but for some reason i cringed a bit when i saw it--probably because of all the dreadful shootings on the news or maybe i'm just getting old and cruddy.  There's also lots of use of the N word--this didn't bother me, but it may offend others.  So--if you are a parent--you may want to skip this movie for the younger kids.

Finally, I gave it 3 stars not because its a bad movie--but because its no Pulp Fiction--which in my opinion is Tarantino's best work.  (Probably one of top 5 movies I have ever seen.)  So I guess I am measuring Tarantino to himself.",1367539200,,1367,4.745762711864407
5260542,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino is a revolutionary filmmaker that has completely changed the landscape of writing and directing in Hollywood.  For the most part, that statement is probably true, but at the same time, it's very difficult to prove that statement to be false.  For better or worse, Tarantino has created a unique style of Hollywood film.  Still, when we think revolutionary figures in Hollywood, we think Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Wells, Stanley Kubrick, and Steven Spielberg.  But, does Tarantino belong on that list, and if he does, should he be one of the people at the top of that list?  These questions are a debatable topic, that's for sure.  However, if he keeps making films equal to or better than Django Unchained, he could cement himself as the greatest filmmaker of all-time.

Taking places two years prior to the American Civil War in Texas, Django Unchained stars Jamie Foxx as Django Freeman, a freed slave turned bounty hunter searching for his enslaved wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington).  Django and his partner, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), locate Broomhilda on a plantation called Candyland and attempt to free her from the ownership of Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a wealthy slave owner.  Samuel L. Jackson, Walton Goggins, and Don Johnson also star in supporting roles to round out the cast.

True enough, Jamie Foxx is in the leading man in Django Unchained, but Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio quickly steal the show with their roles.  Foxx plays the role of slave turned killer well, but being the overbearing gunslinger character that it is - it's far from a memorable role or his best acting performance.  Waltz, on the other hand, has never been better, as he once again plays a charming, yet deadly German character reminiscent of the Nazi officer Hans Landa in Inglorious Basterds, Tarantino's previous film.  DiCaprio also stands out in his role as slave owner Calvin Candie, with the only drawback being DiCaprio doesn't appear until nearly an hour into the film.  Waltz and DiCaprio both portray cleverly quick-tongued characters that are equally loveable and hate-able in their respective roles.

As for the topic of slavery - it wouldn't be a Tarantino film without controversial subject matter.  This film depicts obvious racism throughout in the spirit of being true to the time period.  The depiction of slave whipping and torturous acts are difficult to view at times, but Tarantino brings these travesties to light just enough to embed the merciless degradation by slave owners into the eyes of the audience.  And, once again, it wouldn't be a Tarantino film without some gore to go along with the shootout scenes.

Overall, this film is an entertainment-filled joyride through a troubling period in American history.  Regardless, this film is overly charming with a variety of memorable moments for audiences to enjoy.  History, comedy, action, drama, and beautiful scenery all contribute to make this film a no-brainer, must-see film.  And, while rarely ever mentioned in these reviews, Django Unchained also contains an ear-pleasing soundtrack that fits perfectly with the film.  Tarantino has truly created a work of art that will be appreciated for many years to come.

This is nothing more than a B rated flick at best, (pour, pour acting), designed to stir hatred and descent amongst Americans that spent years working to get along.

Certainly not to be considered a serious documentary on the times,  the Director loves to overstate in all of his movies. This he does with the causes, the reactions and of course, the violence.  The only weak part of the film is Quinton's acting in the small part he assigned to himself.

Wonderful artistic camera angles and scene setups.

It doesn't possess the ""jumping around"" like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs -- it's a little more mainstream. But it has that ""serious"" humor about it -- there are scenes where you think to yourself ""this is funny, but I don't know if I should laugh.""

Now available on the high quality Blu-Ray disc. With several awesome special features, my favorite being the costume design. There are some pretty outrageous costumes used in the film and seeing how seeing how much fun the actors had wearing them is extremely entertaining. Quentin Tarantino really captivates with audience with sensational scenes, and extremely realistic violence. The sequences left you on the edge of your seat the entire movie with each sequence followed up by an even more impressive one.  Tarantino snipes, and satirizes many controversial issues such as the Ku Klux Klan and Slavery but gives the audience a show that they would have never expected. Coming from the same director as Inglorious Basterds any fans of that film would be greatly pleased with this one as well. Although I thought this was a fantastic movie with equal directing, I did feel as if it dragged on quite a bit. Almost a three hour run time that is tough for any movie fan to sit through. I give this film 4/5 stars on this review because it did get hard to follow with such a long screen time. Find more info on this film at [...]

5260615,3,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino, when he's off his game, remains a better movie maker than almost anyone else.  However, there are problems with Django and Tarantino's recent trend to emphasize style and reference at the expense of depth.  This might be why many were offended by scenes where slaves are tortured when the rest of the movie is ""let's see if I can make a 1960s Spaghetti Western.""  As to its other controversies:  Yes there is a lot of the N word, but remember most of the characters are dumb racist hicks (albeit one-dimensional racist hicks).  I wasn't distracted by the other harsh language, except when it became too ""modern"" (I'm not sure a house slave would say motherf***** for example).  The violence, in some cases, is over the top but at other times uncomfortable even for Tarantino (maybe to contrast cartoon excess with real shock, I don't know).  My biggest problems with the movie are pacing and lack of editing--or maybe lack of self-editing.  Like Inglorious Basterds, there is a certain pointlessness to Django.  Other movies by Tarantino have long conversational segments but the dialogue aids the plot and develops character.  In Django, however, there are unneeded scenes (how many bounty hunting events do we need in the first half of the movie before we know how a man becomes who he is?).  The obsession with revenge also takes away from the movie.  In Kill Bill 2 there is a great break-up discussion before Bill is killed by his ex.  In Django Jamie Foxx just shoots an important character in the knees without the essential discussion about race and exploitation that was hinted at all along (they don't even have this talk after the knees are shot off).  Overall, then, you get some good moments interspersed with a lot of down time or slow pacing and a certain shallowness.  When this movie is played over and over on cable, you won't stop to watch it like you find yourself doing every time you come across Pulp Fiction.  On the plus side, I'm more and more impressed by Leonardo DiCaprio, Don Johnson was a pleasant surprise, and nothing undermines racism like a protracted argument over improper hoodwear for a lynching.",1367366400,,2152,4.807065217391305

5260632,3,B00947NAHU,"When I think of the great Western films that I love -- The Outlaw Josey Wales, She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Wild Bunch, et al. -- and of all the great Quentin Tarantino movies that I'm passionate about -- pretty much all of them except Death Proof, and I still like that one -- it leaves me utterly slack-jawed that I'm not overly crazy about Django Unchained, Tarantino's latest and long-awaited offering starring Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kerry Washington. All fanboy expectations put aside, I'm puzzled at how such an epic Western -- or ""Southern"" as Tarantino himself describes the movie -- can have so many moments of awe-inspiring, wide-eyed cinematic greatness and yet somehow come up a little short in the end.

That's not to say Django Unchained isn't a good movie. Quite the opposite, especially given the range of terrific performances, absolutely exquisite cinematography, crackling moments of suspense and heart pumping action sequences balanced with side-splitting humor and quiet dramatic tension. The widescreen cinematic goods are delivered in abundance, with Tarantino's nigh inimitable panache. The plot and characters suffer in comparison; the larger-than-life widescreen bombasticity underscores an underlying story that feels at times, strangely unfocused and adrift.

The Civil War-era tale begins with the freeing of Django (Jamie Foxx) from bondage by German immigrant, dentist, and bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) Dr. King Schultz. Schultz is after a gang known as The Brittle Brothers, one with a huge bounty on their heads, but doesn't have a clue as to what they look like. Django does, as the brothers were overseers on his former plantation. Schultz and Django team up, realize they make a perfect pair, and become partners under the condition that Schultz help Django find and free his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from her enslavement. The couple was forcibly separated after a failed escape attempt, and the parallels between their condition and the Teutonic legend of Siegmund and Brunhilde motivates Schultz enough to help Django in his quest.

The story is simple enough, but an effective one. The first act of the movie is easily the strongest one; the ""origin story"" of Django and Schultz, delving deep into classic Western cinema tropes which Tarantino uses to thrilling results. By the time the obligatory montage sequence occurs, during which we see the pair mowing down bad guys and crossing the exquisitely-shot wilderness on horseback, all set to the exhilarating tones of Jim Croce (!), these guys already feel like western southern legends. Add to this Tarantino's penchant for utilizing wonderful or rarely-seen TV/movie character actors, his masterful hand at delivering humor and suspense, and his offbeat but extremely satisfying soundtrack choices, and so far this movie feels like another gripping Tarantino epic. Yes, that was Tom Wopat (Luke from `The Dukes of Hazzard') as Marshall Gill Tatum during the Daughtrey standoff scene, and man was he great. Who'da thunk it?

And then sadly... the movie comes off the rails by the time it remembers to address the ""Finding Django's wife"" plot. It shifts into a meatier dramatic mode, which is welcome, but by this time we've come to realize that Django, as a lead character, is less compelling than Schultz. By his nature he has to play Schultz's valet/slave/sidekick in order to ward off any undue suspicion, so Foxx's performance is undeniably and understandably restrained, but there's no sense of underlying fire, grit, or danger behind his eyes. We're not entirely sure what drives him at any given moment, and his transition to a driving, calculating, proactive character by the movie's last act comes off as unconvincing and capricious. Furthermore, the act that motivates Django's transformation (I'm tip-toeing around spoilers here) is so out-of-character, selfish, and quizzically idiotic that it not only makes absolutely no sense in the first place, it almost negates everything compelling that the first act of the movie established.

That's not to say there isn't enough action, humor, violence, dialog, and satisfaction to redeem Django Unchained. Furthermore, the powerhouse performances by Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie (the plantation ber-lord who has possession of Broomhilda) and especially Samuel Jackson as Stephen (a terrifyingly compelling ""House Negro"" whose Kaiser Soze-esque switch from a Stepin Fetchit caricature to icily cunning confidante/strategist is both hilariously entertaining and brilliantly rendered) keep the second half of the movie afloat as it starts to needlessly drift away from its far more interesting first half. A slam-bang action finale ends the film with style and kinetic satisfaction, but it's akin to starting your dinner with a perfectly aged and deliciously marbled ribeye grilled to perfection, and having that taken away after joyously eating half of it and replaced with a decent burger. It's good and tasty and satisfying, but damn, you really wanted that steak.",1367280000,,5094,5.346633416458853

Schultz is on the trail of the murderous Brittle brothers, and only Django can lead him to his bounty. so, Schultz acquires Django with a promise to set him free once the brothers are captured, dead or alive. Once that happens, Schultz keeps to his promise and sets Django free. Yet, instead of parting ways, Schultz seeks out the South's most wanted criminals with Django by his side. Honing vital hunting skills, Django remains focused on one goal: finding and rescuing Broomhilda, the wife he lost to the slave trade long ago. That, my friends, is where the real story begins...

5260655,4,B00947NAHU,"There is something about Quentin Tarantino that rubs me the wrong way. I keep watching his movies and I keep secretly hoping that I am not going to like them. So far, I have been consistently disappointed in that hope and, whatever my no doubt petty reasons are for harboring a mysterious grudge against the man, I have to admit, he makes pretty good movies. This movie was pretty good. Not as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inglourious-Basterds-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B002T9H2LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inglourious Basterds (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, in my opinion, but still pretty good. Quentin Tarantino is a good writer and, at the very least, his movies are always interesting, and there is never any cliche dialogue.

The characters in the movie are, of course, very interesting. I believe Quentin Tarantino said in his Oscar acceptance speech that if his films are still remembered in a hundred years it will be for the characters he created. I think that is probably true. There are four characters that stand out in the movie. Calvin Candie as a detestable white plantation owner, and Stephen, his conniving African American servant, make excellent antagonists, and Dr. King Schultz and Django Freeman make excellent protagonists. Unfortunately, I felt like, of the four, Django was the least fleshed out. I would have liked to have seen more of his history (how did he get to be so good with a gun? how did he meet Broomhilda?). Broomhilda could have been fleshed out a bit more as well, but the acting was excellent all around.

I also would have liked to have seen more humor in the movie. There is a scene fairly early on in the movie that was really hilarious, where a bunch of klansmen are out to get revenge on Dr. Schultz and Django, but they are all having trouble seeing out of the eye holes of their white sheets, and they have a long argument about what to do about it. I thought it was not only really funny, but a brilliant way to undercut the klan and make them look as ridiculous as they really are. The klan is usually portrayed as very menacing. I thought it was great to see them portrayed as a bunch of bumbling fools. Humor, I think, is often a much more powerful corrosive than anger. I wish there had been more scenes like that in the second half of the movie.

SPOILER ALERT. I was not entirely satisfied with the revenge aspect of the film. I am not sure how long it actually was, but it felt like at least the last hour of the film or so (perhaps a bit less) was a long bloodbath of revenge. I find Quentin Tarantino's rewriting of history in an effort to provide a kind of catharsis very interesting, but I thought it was more effective in Inglorious Basterds. The crescendo scene in Inglorious Basterds is more condensed and it just felt more satisfying to me. I was waiting for that cathartic moment at the end of this film and I did not feel like I really got it.

I think that the people who are complaining that this was not an accurate depiction of slavery are missing the point to some degree. There is still a lot of anger about slavery in this country, as there should be, and it is not just in the African American community. I am not African American, but I am still angry about our history of slavery. This movie works the way most movies work: it condenses all of the evil of slavery into a few characters, gets the audience angry, and then releases that anger in a crescendo of violence. I understand the intention, I just do not think it was as effective as it was in Inglorious Basterds.

One other disappointment I had was with the Broomhilda legend. It does not seem to me to be a real legend but that is not what disappointed me. The legend is set up as if it is meant to be a prefiguration of what is going to happen. Broomhilda has been set up on a mountain top, guarded by a dragon, and surrounded by the fires of hell. Siegfried goes to get her and must slay the dragon and pass through the fires of hell. I do not feel like Tarantino did enough to cash out that prefiguration. Presumably, the dragon would be Candie, but his death was too quick and easy, and perhaps the fires of hell were meant to foreshadow the dynamite, but Django does not pass through those fires. I wish Tarantino had more clearly worked out the parallels in the two stories. It would not have had to be literal. I was not expecting Django to walk through actual fire. I just felt like it was a set up that was never totally paid off.

All that having been said, it was still a very entertaining movie. Quentin Tarantino seems to me to make movies mostly for the fun of it. The issues this film deals with are serious issues (racism, slavery, etc.) but those issues seem like more of a set up for a fun revenge flick than a serious examination of serious themes. Which is fine. I admit that I always have fun watching a Quentin Tarantino movie. Maybe that is why I resent him so much.

EDIT 8/6/17: I am adding edits to a few of my reviews that have sort of stuck in my craw. I find my opinions about books and movies tend to shift as I have more time for reflection, as I encounter new books and movies that alter my taste, and so on. If I were rating this movie today I would give it a lower rating. I am actually not a huge Tarantino fan. His movies are too clever and they are basically just montages of tough guys engaging in lyrical repartees before violently murdering each other. The one Tarantino movie I can say without qualification that I liked was Inglorious Basterds and I also got some enjoyment out of the Kill Bill movies. But aside from those exceptions I have decided to take a heroic stand against the prevailing Zeitgeist and make my opinions about Tarantino a matter of public record. I will try to remain humble despite my obvious heroism.",1367107200,3,5861,4.53926206244087

5260660,5,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained is a great movie. Seriously. For all the controversy this movie has, Quentin Tarantino managed to make a really fine western movie. Jamie Foxx was Excellent as Django. Leonardo Dicaprio was Brilliant as Calvin Candie the greedy slave owner. Though this was my first time seeing him in a film, Christoph Waltz did a terrific job as Dr Schultz. The most overlooked and more hilarious of all the characters was Samuel L Jackson as Stephen. Samuel L Jackson can tackle any role with style and he does a very memorable job playing Stephen. In my opinion all the main actors in this movie could have been nominated; especially Jackson and Dicaprio. The Story line is great so there will not be any dull moments with the movie. The rest of the supporting cast all stayed true to character and did a wonderful job. My initial reaction after watching Django Unchained was: ""Wow that was a Good movie"" but after a second viewing: Django Unchained gets:

5260661,4,B00947NAHU,"There are two things you should know going into this movie: First, this is a Tarintino movie. That mean there will be gratuitous violence and blood splattering. Second, this is a Tarintino movie. That means that if you're either a die-hard conservative OR liberal, your delicate sensibilities will be offended by the depiction of what white Southerners circa 1850 were actually like. (Whereas die-hard conservatives like to whitewash history, no pun intended, and die-hard liberals will wince at the drop of every N-bomb.) The movie itself is one of Tarinino's best except for two noticeable flaws. The first is that for a great deal of the movie, Foxx's character, Django, spends a lot of his time in the shadow of other characters, most notably DiCaprio's turn as a plantation owner. In fact by the time Django and Shultz reach Candieland, the movie is practically turned over to DiCaprio's Calvin Candie (and to a lesser extent, Samuel L. Jackson's role as Stephen). Despite the film's title, it's never fully Django's movie, at least not until the end. The second flaw again comes during the film's time at Candieland, which - despite DiCaprio and Jackson's best efforts - dragged about 20 minutes too long. I count these complaints as more than trivial and enough to deny the movie's perfection even though the rest of the movie wins on every other account; the casting, the acting, the cinematography, the comic relief, and especially the score - no one matches music to movies better than Tarintino. At 2 hours and 45 minutes, yes, the movie is too long. But it's less torture than 90 minutes of even the best rom-com.",1367107200,,1625,4.891304347826087

Despite all the hoopla surrounding this film, one has to paraphrase Orwell's dictum that there are ideas--read movies--so out of wack and far fetched that only an ""intellectual""--read fancy over-educated movie critics--would believe in them. Same here. The movie tries to be so out of the box and pretentious that the admirers of Tarantino think that this film is so crazy it must be great. However, the average, half-educated viewer with half a brain would see the movie for what it is: an overly long, catoonish, foul-mouthed, disjointed, depressing depiction attempt by a fairly good film-maker who can be clever and entertaining when he wants to be.

But some, such as Kill Bill I and II, Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds are more exceptional than others, From Dusk Till Dawn, Jackie Brown, and Hostel.  I'd put Django somewhere in the middle. I really enjoyed it, but Tarantino has set the bar so damn high, that in comparison with other movies out there, it's incredible, but comparing it to all his movies, it's falling a little short. I wanted more information right off the bat about how the Doctor found Django and what specifically he heard other than that he'd be able to point out the people he was looking for.  I would have liked to see his training be something more interesting, such as Uma's in Kill Bill II.  There were some witty lines, but nothing like what you see in the above mentioned. Kerry Washington was wasted in her role. All she did was cry and act scared. They even have her faint in one scene.  Granted, her circumstances were the very worst, but so were Django's and he was a bad ass. Tarantino could have made her more of a partner, and stronger, like the women in his other movies.  She could have helped Django versus just be helped by him.  DiCaprio and Samuel Jackson are magnificent. The story is compelling and the idea of a slave turned bounty hunter is fantastic.

Enjoy.......",1367020800,,719,4.373134328358209
5260713,2,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino became famous with his high concept modern adventure movies. They have succeeded largely because they had these huge infusions of style in most improbable ways. They have many fantasy elements intermixed with what purports to be naturalistic dialog. For example in Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction the story is broken up into chapters each of which has a mini-title sequence and then these chapters are presented out of order. In Kill Bill he has a whole chapter presented as a Japanese style cartoon. The killers in Pulp Fiction discuss hamburgers in a realistic manner but then behave like comic book superheroes. This juxtaposition of the banal with the extraordinary  is a shock to the audience. This style is what made Tarantino famous.

Quentin Tarantino heretofore has always made contemporary films aimed at pure entertainment. Django is a sharp break from that practice. It is a pseudo historical film based as it says - 'two years before the Civil War'. Of course 1858 was three years before the Civil War not two. I expect that gratuitous error is just another stylistic element rather like false history in Inglourious Basterds. In both of these films Tarantino introduces a wildly improbable and totally despicable set of villains so as to justify his hero's elaborate and graphic revenge. In Basterds the monsters are German Nazis. In Django they are white Americans.

Django is a kind of spaghetti Western in the same sense that Kill Bill was a kind of of Samurai movie. The original Django as played by Franco Nero was a kind of poor man's Clint Eastwood and the 'Man with No Name'. But there are some major differences. Previously Tarantino made amoral action movies. Pulp Fiction for example has no message. It introduces drugs, contract killings, sado-masochism and organized crime but only to shock and delight the audience. It does not try to make a moral statement about the morality of taking drugs and killing people. Those outrageous actions are presented in a straight forward factual manner. Tarantino does not preach. His style is 'cool'.

But in Django he adopts a hotter style and a more distant view point. Tarantino tries very hard to enlist us the audience to hate white Southerners. Django is filled with material that strives to make a political-moral point. It is very, very preachy. He becomes rather like older Hollywood directors Stanley Kramer or Norman Jewson who made screen dramas with strong civil rights messages. Those earlier movies always starred Sidney Poitier as a sympathetic and noble black man. The whites were typically slack jawed and slovenly cretins. Jaime Foxx is not elegant like Poitier or even sympathetic. He is continuously surly. Tarantino has to work hard to get the audience to accept such an ugly, nasty character as a hero. He does this by portraying almost all the whites in the movie as degenerate monsters. Whites spend all of their time whipping or torturing the black slaves. This sets up the scenes where Django can be seen as justified for killing whites.

Tarantino wanted to make a moralistic civil rights type movie. He put it in a spaghetti Western wrapper and set in in the distant past. This later choice was crucial. Modern audiences especially modern white audiences are familiar with modern black behavior and the black condition. Modern day blacks are not very sympathetic. The public perception is that they rape, rob, and murder while collecting welfare and food stamps. When Tarantino presented Ving Rhames in Pulp Fiction he was shown as a rich mob boss. He sends out his minions to exact revenge on his enemies. Not a nice guy. Such a black character won't do in a civil rights type movie. Civil rights themed movies are always set in the past.

So Tarantino had to set the action in the distant past. Many conventional modern civil rights movies like Mississippi Burning also avoid a contemporary plot line because the modern black man is just not sympathetic. They set their stories back in the 1950s or 1960s when every right thinking white person knew that black people were blameless victims. Tarantino takes that one step further. Tarantino takes us back to the slavery period in his quest to find a sympathetic black man.

The problem is that Tarantino is not well equipped for period pictures. Tarantino's best movies have many 'over the top' scenes. The sword fighting sequences in Kill Bill and the gangster sequences in Pulp Fiction are not in any way realistic. They are fantasies. We recognize this and accept it - its fun. The Nazi hunters in his only other historical movie 'Inglourious Basterds' are also wild crazy caricatures. The audience is quite familiar with WWII events and stories. We get it. But in a story set before the Civil War we get confused. Are these insanely blood thirsty white people meant to be real? Or are they just fantasy extrapolations like the bizarre Kill Bill assassins?

Tarantino emerged as a maker of 'new' movies. He uses lots of older material like obscure pop music but his purpose has always been to show the paying customers something new. He reverses himself with Django. This is an old fashion preachy civil rights movie told with new elements. About the only really entertaining theme in the film is that of the bounty hunter. We have seen bounty hunters before but never one like this. Before the hunter was a tall, taciturn, loner who tracked down the bad guys in the wilderness. Waltz is a short, old, garrulous social gad fly. He tricks the men he hunts and kills them in cold blood. He does this in public and then produces a paper that shows his authority to kill. It's a clever plot device and as far as I know completely original.

Waltz is best known as a movie Nazi, and he is a kind of Nazi here. He speaks German and he kills efficiently. His purpose in the film seems to be to show that regular white Americans are worse yet.

We know now that about 25% of cowboys in the American West were black. Many conventional Westerns have shown us black cowboys for  decades. Yet in Django Unchained everyone is amazed to see a black man on a horse. Some try to shoot him for being uppity. Why interject such a stupid and incongruous element? It doesn't seem to be just characteristic Tarantino hyperbole done for stylistic purposes. It seems like a true blunder. Tarantino's famous Hollywood trivia scholarship for once has betrayed him.

The whole plot is a set up for the last half hour in which Django kills lots and lots of white people. This is reminiscent of Kill Bill I in which Kiddo chops up about a hundred Yakuza single handedly. That was an 'over the top' homage to various low budget Samurai movies. Django's killing spree looks like many another spaghetti western except for the blood. Django is a lightning fast pistollero - although how he acquired that much skill that quickly is not very well explained. We can accept that this former field hand is now a world class gunman as necessary to the story. The more bizarre part is the blood.

Oddly enough all that spurting blood comes from Samurai movies. Kurosawa made a blood machine for the climax of his great Samurai movie ""Sanjuro"". Mifune cuts through Nadakai's torso in the final duel. Then the blood machine malfunctioned. Instead of a pouring out of blood when the abdominal aorta was cut, the damn thing gave this huge blood explosion, as if a high pressure hose had been severed. The special effects  technician apologized and started to set it up again, when Kurosawa said, no he liked it, leave it in. Sam Peckinpaw saw Sanjuro and loved the effect. In the final reels of ""The Wild Bunch"" all the Mexicans when hit by a bullet explode in blood as if they are not solid people at all, but very taut high pressure blood balloons. Tarantino continues that practice. Quite silly but that's Hollywood. It's a loony convention now.

The blood convention joins the revenge convention. Django is a very conventional movie. You can see the plot twists coming from far off. No shocks or surprises here.

In making a civil rights parable Tarantino has become a much more conventional and much less interesting director.",1367020800,,8149,4.81

5260727,5,B00947NAHU,"It is not family-friendly.
His movies: one either loves them or hates them, there is no in-between. This is a well-established fact.
Professional critics that do not like his movies and have to go watch them because they are paid to do it must hate every single second. Their reviews show that. Critics on the other side of the street, so to speak, who love them to bits, cannot praise them enough. Let's, therefore, ignore the critics and watch the movie. Unless one has seen one or two of Tarantino's before, and is on the hate-them side. Then, better stay home and play canasta, poker, or do whatever else the heart might fancy at the time.
That said, in my opinion, this is the best Tarantino movie ever - except for all the rest.
""Django"" does not deserve those prizes it got. It deserves more, but The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for example, has nothing better to give than the Oscar, so it gave it two.
It's got all those things someone who cannot stomach Tarantino's creations will say it does not have, or has too much of: real dialog, not grunts and yells punctuated with hysterical laughter. It is slow where that is the right pacing, and it goes fast exactly where it should. There is precision here, nothing wasted. There is violence too: it out-wilds the ""Wild Bunch"", for sure.
Much has been said about the ever present violence in Tarantino's work, so I'll try to explain my own take on it: With its rivers of blood and stacks of corpses, with all the violent deaths that made those corpses, it is in some very fine company going back to farthest antiquity: all those ancient sagas and epic poems, with their lavish descriptions of fights between bigger than life antagonists: how lungs were pierced, eyes gouged, bones cracked, heads smashed, necks snapped, until one or the other finally bit the dust ""and his soul fled, raging and howling, to the shadows"" (as Virgil liked to put it.)
It lasts exactly as much as it should. The actors give their all to their roles. Tarantino has a certain kind of genius for getting the very best of actors and crew. And a very fine cast and crew they are. If you want to see beautiful acting, splendid photography, and listen to clever repartee, this movie's got all that in spades.
If you are looking for an accurate portrait of the Antebellum South, or of the horrors of slavery, look elsewhere. The movie has some serious points to make about these, but it does so through theatrical exaggeration with touches of Grand Guignol.
This is a fantasy: a fanciful crossover of historical drama with Spaghetti Western (or, rather, a ""Southern"", as the director has described it). Tarantino, years ago, said that he thought Sergio de Leone's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" was the best action movie ever filmed. I do not know if he still sees it that way, but he is showing in ""Django"" a deep respect and love for that old genre: here he has taken much from it, and he has used it right. But it is very much his own movie, and of the actors and crew, as it should be.",1366934400,,3036,4.5218181818181815

5260731,5,B00947NAHU,"It seems that somewhere between Pulp Fiction and now, Tarantino has learned how to make a movie with some amount of depth and even occasional subtlety.  I admit I don't know when that occurred, because the soulless Pulp Fiction thoroughly put me off his work for a while.  At some point QT got into elaborate revenge flicks, and having covered women and Jewish people already he's now turned to African-Americans.  When I watched Django I was more interested in the controversy than the movie, but I actually found the latter quite engaging and not as uncomfortable as I expected it to be.

The media informs us that Tarantino movies glorify over-the-top violence, but at least with Django the reality is a bit more nuanced.  Importantly, violence against slaves is ONLY meant to be thoroughly disturbing.  The way such scenes are shot reinforces this through focusing on other characters' faces as they look pained or saddened, and toning down the gore to realistic levels for the situation.  Violence towards criminals and slave owners is over-the-top to the point of cartoonish, freeing one from the obligation to empathize with said bad people.  The excess in these scenes is more to do with ludicrous blood splatters than sadistic punishment, with most people just dying in gunfights.  Conversely, if you turn on network TV, you may see someone flayed and several people burned to death by ""good guys"", so I'm coming to the conclusion that QT is unfairly scapegoated for the violence in our media.

Moral quibbles aside, Django is a good movie with great acting.  It's also free of the famous ""Tarantino conversations"", which I find distracting though I understand they represent realistic patterns of speech.  No other part of the movie is heavily concerned with realism.  History and ballistics are reinterpreted through the lens of what looks coolest at the moment.  Though this led to me rolling my eyes a couple of times, it's a stylistic choice and thus not a big deal.

Django Unchained isn't perfect, but I'm giving it five stars for being the best at what it is: a revenge epic turned up-to-eleven that fearlessly depicts a sore spot in our history.  Show me another movie that can pull that off with any class.",1366934400,,2225,4.8933333333333335
5260732,4,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino is obviously a movie lover. He takes on so many genres in his film making that he creates a blend that is uniquely his own. Django Unchained is a reimagining of the 1960's spaghetti westerns and for the most part the film works. The viewer gets caught up in the action and the story progresses well if a little slowly at times. Set mostly in the pre Civil War South, Tarantino makes what he calls a ""Southern"" rather than the traditional Western. In telling his tale he takes on the institution of slavery and racial injustice.

Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx) is a former slave who has been given his freedom in order to join Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a bounty hunter to track down and kill the vicious Brittle Brothers. Once this job is done Django is paid seventy-five dollars and given his freedom. Django  decides that he is good at the bounty hunting business and continues on in his  business venture with King. Django's ultimate goal is to find and free his wife Broomhilda Von Schaft (Kerry Washington) from slavery. Django and Schultz learn that she is now at the Mississippi plantation of Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). In order to free her an elaborate ruse is set up involving Mandingo type fighting which is ultimately discovered by Candie's house servant Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) and the inevitable Tarantino bloodbath ensues.

The film ,while excellent in its own right just doesn't stand up to earlier Tarantino efforts. While the screenplay and acting are very good throughout there is simply no reason that the almost three hour length was necessary. The movie slows considerably in the second act and the film 's ultra violent conclusion may be off putting to some viewers. This film was one of the features that I was most looking forward to of the Occar contenders and while good did not measure up to the likes of Argo or Zero Dark Thirty. That is not to say that it is not a good film or a fun film to watch just a little bit underwhelming.

The film in addition to great acting by Waltz offers a script with some admittedly great lines. The Regulators scenes are particularly effective at blending humor and over the top action. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is always crisp and beautiful.

5260745,4,B00947NAHU,"This movie was very entertaining right from the start.  When it started with the titles and music, I was taken aback.  I wondered why the music sounded like spaghetti western music from the 60's and 70's.  Well turns out that was exactly what they intended.  I quickly saw, that it was a spoof of westerns of that time period.  There was a lot of everything in this movie.  Most points except the conditions of slavery, were very exaggerated on purpose, to the point of being more exaggerated even than the 60's and 70's they were spoofing, but that's what made many scenes funny.  (The shooting scenes were WAY over the top bloody)  and if you know anything at all about firearms, you can see that these scenes are clearly not meant to be an accurate depiction of what happens when someone gets shot.  Therefore, more spoofing on spaghetti westerns, WAY  more spoofing.  So even though it was blood soup and blood explosions at times you can see, once you get past the initial shock of the scene, what they are doing.  The scene with the mob of hooded (ku Klux clan type) riding out to go after django and the bounty hunter, was quite funny,  silly, to be sure, but funny. (I am speaking here of the dialog that took place concerning the hoods they were wearing.)  So, if your looking for a very serious commentary on slavery, this isn't the movie for you.  If your looking for a movie that is just entertaining and you don't get all freaked out by blood, you will find this movie to be engaging.  All portrayals of all the parts are exaggerated, with the exception  of  the part that DiCaprio plays as the plantation owner of Candyland.  He is as debase as they come in the part, and I dare say, just cracking the surface of what went on there, but it is primarily a movie about revenge against the plantation owners and a statement about not just the physical misery slaves went through but the extreme and deliberate mental torture slaves went through.

opening credits, to the soundtrack, to the ""Panavision"" vistas of the American southwest, central Spain, Mexico, or any
other place these old films were churned out, Django is determined to take us there.
Then, underneath the iconic story line of ""two good guys fight off 50 bad guys to save girl"", lurks the real message that
we are all still feeling guilty about. The real history of the United States is built upon a heritage of horrific crimes against
humanity. The great cast, especially Christopher Waltz, almost distract us from this underlying theme. I look forward to

The thing that singles this movie out from the others is the fact that it brings back the atrocity of slavery and reminds us of a past that many would like to forget, but should not be. The black people of that time were treated as possessions, not human. Watching the characters evolve into a hero is very good for the soul. And seeing things as they were less than one hundred and fifty years ago is horrifying. The struggle of the protagonist to find and free his loved one had me rooting for him and feeling his frustration. This movie is daring, and very bold in its true depiction of the struggle some Americans had in becoming part of our modern world. I would recommend that everyone of age see this story.

5260779,5,B00947NAHU,"Django is a good film and it contains a lot of action in the times shortly before the civil war.  Django is a freed slave seeking a way to find and save his wife from a life of slavery and brutality.  He is befriended by a man who has given him hope that accomplishing his goal is possible.

This is a typical Quentin Tarantino film with graphic violence and language but it is also filled with action and adventure.  The cinematography is very good in the film and the storyline are interesting.  Saved from slavery by a German dentist (Christoph Waltz) who is now a bounty hunter, Django (Jamie Fox) becomes a master gunman and bounty hunter and so the adventure begins.....

The film features an all-star cast and the acting is very good.  It is almost like an old Clint Eastwood type of western story.  I enjoyed the action of the film and the acting.  Jamie Fox did a wonderful job in the lead role.  Christoph Waltz in the role of the German dentist also did a fantastic job and you begin to like him and his personality more and more as the film goes on.  The film does have a lot of graphic violence and language in it and some of the scenes are very bloody.  The film for me was entertaining but perhaps a bit long at 166 minutes.

It is a classic western film done in Quentin Tarantino style and if you are one of the fans of his movies then this is a must see film.",1366761600,,1376,4.226053639846743
5260780,5,B00947NAHU,"Whether or not you like or love Tarantino's films.  If so, you will like or love this movie, and if you don't you will probably hate it.  Like many of his other films it is over the top with violence.  There is a reviewer who described it as ""aweful"" because it was violent and unrealistic.  Anyone who has seen Kill Bill, Inglorious Bastereds, and even Pulp Fiction knows that is Tarantino's hallmark.  He goes overboard on the gore and violence and makes it almost campy.

The first 10 min of the film is pure gold.  Cristoph Waltz was great and essentially (if you read between the lines) gave a dissertation on the entire south during that period of history in just a few sentences.  Jamie Foxx does a good job as Django, but it was not anything special.  Samuel L Jackson really stole the entire movie.  He was very much the bad guy of the film.  There is liberal use of the ""n-word"" in the movie, but if you pay attention to the entire tone of the film you will know it was done to condemn the time period and the institution of slavery, and not to be degrading.

If you are a fan of Tarantino, then this movie is worth having.  It is very much in the same vein as his others.  If you are not, or are easily offended then you will probably want to skip this one.",1366761600,,1268,4.229166666666667

5260786,5,B00947NAHU,"If you review a Quentin Tarantino film, you must grant him leeway on some things, otherwise, a false rating would have to be given. ""Django Unchanined"" is a brilliant and excellent film with one minor glitch: all those explosive eruptions in human bodies from single bullets. So grant is given.

Some reviewers refer to this film as a Western revenge film. I call it Magic Realism, a genre which would explain the immediate evolution of Django's gunslinging skills, his vocabulary explosion, and a new-found confidence in speaking educated English (or American). The most blantant exhibit of Django's evolution from lowly slave to freeman to confident bounty-hunter to bold Black Man, finally to Super Hero is through costuming and precisely through what Django selects as each juncture of his rise. The froppery of the blue costume indicates the inexperience in selecting what should represent the subtle quality of a free man. Finally, the leather vest and the weathered look of a cowboy depict a man who has arrived: not a black man, but a full man, a man who is not only free himself, but free to free others, to be a Super Hero.

Magic Realism is a South American creation in taking sordid facts of history and incorporating totally unrealistic things to make the history more tolerable. In the South the first slaves who disappeared in stories through the magic of simply flying away while actually traveling through the Underground Railroad were probably the first indications of this magic in this realistic setting. Tarantino rescues a lowly slave into freedom via the moneyed hands of a German immigrant, untainted by the strictures of slavery as Southerners knew and experienced it. Thus, even slaves themselves adhered to that set of rules, most notably through the character of Stephen, played by Samuel L. Jackson. There could not be a more obsequious slave than Stephen. However, in private Stephen actually becomes his white master's confident confidant. It's a shuck, thus a bit of magic realism.

When Django (Jamie Foxx) becomes this amazing gunslinger in the most rapid sleight of hand, Tarantino is playing with magic realism. Does the viewer allow this ""willing suspension of disbelief?"" Since it's Tarantino, it should be a given (except for the exploding flesh). It was also fascinating to watch Foxx transform from an uneducated slave into the Super Hero he finally becomes--watch for the suggestion of Roy Rogers at the end (or so I thought).

Homage to other films is another of Tarantino's trademarks. The most obvious was the slowing running word MISSISSIPPI across the screen when the doctor and Django arrived in the hotbed of racism, Mississippi. The huge letters paid homage to ""Mississippi Burning,"" a film with Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, a film saturated with murder and mayhem to this film in which murder and mayhem are soon to happen but in reverse.

In the Mississippi setting in a plantation named Candyland, after the Candie family, comes the despicable Col. Candie, played with aplomb and relish by Leonardo DeCaprio. Oh my gosh, but he was good--uh, bad, and so convincing.

I would be remiss if I did not mention Christoph Waltz, so deserving of his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Tarantino's weaving of this German character into a Southern setting, especially naming his black female slave after a German mythological character, was simply brilliant. How he puts these two characters together is the focal point for Django's later heroic rescue. Of course, Tarantino manipulated the plot, but so cleverly!

""Django Unchained"" is the story of a classic hero quest: Django is the hero, the doctor is the Wise Old Man, both having various obstacles to overcome, a villain in Col. Candie, and the damsel who must be rescued. I always thought the Star Wars story was a perfect quest theme, but ""Django Unchained"" has become a modern, although historic, mode for the quest theme.

Jamie Fox and Christoph Waltz were fantastic. The soundtrack was perfect, as usual for a Tarantino film. There is one scene where Django and Hilda are running from the slave catchers that was one of my favorites. It just seemed so real. It was shot perfectly. The acting by all the actors was great.

Read the 'Exception clause.'

13th Amendment Text

Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

There is a moment under way to enact the 'Exception Clause' in the 13th Amendment, to send all the brownies in jail having
been duly convicted, back to their roots in Africa.  Repatriation under the 13th Amendment.  This mean even if a browny get a
speeding ticket and is found guilty of violating the law, they forfeit their Constitutional rights under the Exception Clause.
Sad to say.  I wouldn't want that hanging over my head.  So, behave yourself and respect others and the law.

IF I WERE A BROWNY SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE IN JAIL TO GROW OLD AND DIE, I WOULD HIRE A CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER

GAIN YOUR FREEDOM IN A NATIVE COUNTRY?  WHERE YOU COULD EVENTUALLY FIND FREEDOM.  THE 13TH AMENDMENT

5260842,5,B00947NAHU,"It's rare that a 165-minute flick never makes me look at my watch, but I was with this one all the way through. It starts strong and then shifts into an even better gear when DiCaprio shows up. His excellent performance makes this one, but Foxx and especially Wertz are equally splendid. The compositions are uniformly gorgeous, as is the production design. The script is almost flawless, and Tarantino certainly deserved the Oscar for it.

There's not a bad bit of acting in this, nor many wasted moments. My only niggle is the typically overblown QT slow-mo blood-spattering grindhouse shootout at the end. If it had been a little less gleeful in its bloodlust this might be one of the best Westerns ever made. Yet it gets way over the top and out of hand by the finale and kind of brings the film back to Hollywood, unfortunately. But the good far outweighs the bad here, and as one of the most honest cinematic depictions of slavery's horrors, and American capitalism's conveniently forgotten origins, it earns its place as one of the best American movies of the past few years.

The blu-ray is a perfect transfer, and looks great. The superb score sounds very crisp and warm in surround, and the extras have three brief docs that are quite good, especially the one on the production designer who died during the shoot. However, the extras feature the cast and crew talking over and over about how totally awesomely super-duper wonderful QT is, as with most of his dvd/bd extras. The man does not lack in ego, to be sure. But then again, he backs it up with the goods here, so fair dinkum.

5260848,4,B00947NAHU,"If you are a Quentin Tarantino fan, DJANGO UNCHAINED will not disappoint you. But if you are not a fan, be prepared for a pure Tarantino journey into excessive violence, absurdity and offbeat humor.

The premise of the story is offbeat, a German born bounty hunter (played by the delightful Christop Waltz) frees a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) simply to physically identify some criminals on the bounty hunter's list. Here is where you have to go with the Tarantino plot since it's as offbeat as a story can be especially as the duo become friends and work as a bounty hunter team. The ultimate purpose of this team is to find and reunite Django's wife who was sold to another plantation.

Skip the plot holes and simply go along for the ride and an amazing ride it is. Tarantino never has a problem in getting top notch actors from today and from the past to fill his roles. Leonard DiCaprio, Don Johnson, Tom Wopat, and Samuel L. Jackson to name a few. Italian actor Franco Nero, the original Django from the 1960's spaghetti western, has a cameo. Except for sharing the same theme song, the two movies have nothing in common. DJANGO UNCHAINED is a Tarantino creation. The actors seem to enjoy working with Tarantino to make DJANGO UNCHAINED a pure epic.

Set just before the Civil War, DJANGO UNCHAINED brutally displays the horrors and violence of slavery. The inhumanity can be unbearable to watch yet somehow, and this is the amazing part of Tarantino's genius, the brutality is interspersed with almost slapstick comedy. Imagine a group of pre-KKK hooded thugs arguing over the comfort and practicality of their homemade hoods. Only Tarantino could pull off this mixture of brutality and comedy.

Samuel L. Jackson is completely unrecognizable as the elderly and creepy house slave Stephen on the not so aptly named Candie Plantation. Stephen is the stereotypic ""yes"" man with his ""owner"" Calvin Candie (Leonard DiCaprio) except when they are alone behind closed doors and the roles are reversed. Stephen's devotion is again to the point of the absurd,

The film is a Tarantino epic and it can drag on longer than it should with its cast of what seems like thousands. It's the journey into the absurd that makes DJANGO UNCHAINED hold our interest. This wouldn't happen in real life but yet Tarantino makes it all seem like part of the natural course of things. It is often an unnerving and disturbing film in its depictions of slavery and the violence. The moments of humor provide some respite from the horrors being shown. Tarantino's mind is an amazing jumble of images and only he could have made a movie like DJANGO UNCHAINED.",1366675200,3,2641,4.795604395604395

It glorified racism to an extent! And you know what the shame of it is, the others, don't even know the difference. This generation has been so badly tricked that they see nothing wrong or dangerous with what was done in this film, that's the scary part! How bad this empire is becoming. This, like ""Inglorious Basterds"" is an extremely dangerous and trouble-making film! Our families didn't die in the holocaust camps and our African-American brothers and sisters weren't forced into slavery to be used by Tarantino!

5260851,5,B00947NAHU,"""Django Unchained"" is probably the best RomCom that I've ever seen, far better than any of those Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan flops such as ""You've Got Mail.""  What, you think that ""Django Unchained"" is NOT a RomCom?

You've surely got romance.  What could be more romantic than a night in shining armor -- or at least a cowboy on a horse -- travelling cross country to find his long lost love?  And you've surely got comedy.  What could be more comical than watching a cameo of Quentin Tarantino with him finally get his just desserts?

And speaking of Mr. Tarantino:  I've been hit and miss with him over the years.  I'm not a fan of violence for violence's sake.  I thought that ""Reservoir Dogs"" was pretty much torture porn, an unwatchable movie that promoted violence, particularly against cops.  But then I really liked ""Inglorious Basterds,"" a film that, while surely violent -- a home run shot to someone's head is surely violent, isn't it? -- was also very funny and well thought out.  And ""Django Unchained"" to me is more like ""Basterds"" as, yes, there is violence.  But there is reason for that violence.

And there is reason for Jamie Foxx to kill everyone in sight, up-to-and-including Samuel L. Jackson.  Particularly Mr. Jackson.  A lot has been made of the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio was once again snubbed for his terrific performance here by the Academy.  The ""logical"" thinking went as follows:  ""How can you give an Oscar to someone who uses the N-word like 1000 times in one film?""  Well, from what I remember, Mr. DiCaprio didn't write the dialog; that would have been the job for Mr. Tarantino.  But Mr. Tarantino did win I believe for best direction, so the logic really falls apart here.  But the one guy that I wanted to see die in this film the most:  Mr. Jackson.  He is the worst kind of slimeball, the worst kind of suck up.  But he didn't write his lines or actions either.

(It should be noted that I saw Mr. Foxx on ""Saturday Night Live"" last year, and hated his performance.  I turned it off fairly quickly.  He went way over the line; no doubt about it.  However, I am generally able to separate the art from the artist, and so I still watched this film later and thought that his performance was fantastic.  I would strongly advise him never to pull a stunt like that SNL monologue again, however.  Otherwise, I will lose my patience with him and I won't separate the art from the artist with regards to him again.)

One scene that maybe didn't quite work for me:  Christoph Waltz, who gives another terrific performance but this time as the ""good guy.""  He does something that went against his character at one point.  I won't say what he does, but it would have made more sense to have Django do it as then the characters' behaviors and motivations would have been more consistent.  However, they did need someone to do this ""thing"" as a plot device to drive the third act.  I think that you'll know what I mean when you see the film.

We can argue all day long about the genre of the film, whether it's a RomCom, whether it's a Western, whether it's this or that.  But what surely is not arguable:  ""Django Unchained"" is a whole lot of fun.  But I'll give a big pass on the Academy, who dropped the ball once again by not nominating one of the greatest actors of our generation with another excellent performance:  Leonardo DiCaprio.",1366675200,,3367,4.519071310116086
5260852,4,B00947NAHU,"(WARNING! Plot Point & Last Quarter SPOILERS Ahead!) My two cents?  Absolutely brilliant, thrilling, disturbing, exhilarating, hilarious, violent, expansive, and beautiful......until after the Candy Land massacre.  A muddled last quarter finale not helped by Mr. Tarentino's lame vanity acting. Most of what came before was actually believable and exciting, but after losing two of the main characters it seems Quentin was at a loss at how to end it.  Although Jamie Foxx was excellent, contrary to some reviewers, Leonard DiCaprio and ESPECIALLY Christoph Waltz were so dynamic that their loss sucked the life out of what happened afterwards.  Worth seeing and worth owning but more of a three and a half star film raised to four by DiCaprio and ESPECIALLY Waltz.  That's my two cents......

5260863,5,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained is a very gratifying movie, a unique western that almost deserves its own category as both an entertainment piece and also an educational tool. It is in a lot of ways standard Tarantino fare with the obligatory action scenes and blood but it also grows into something more. It's very much a man against the system story. But, as the tale unfolds, it goes beyond the predictable gory narrative and becomes an allegory of revenge, integrity and social ignorance. It has funny, satirical moments as well as scenes where you, like the good guys, have trouble holding in your rage at what you are seeing. All things said, it may very well be the best movie Tarantino has ever directed.

  In brief and without giving up too much plot information, this movie is about a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who was separated from his wife by his master as a form of punishment common in the Antebellum South. As we meet our soon to be hero, he is without hope and has all but given up on everything. Everything begins to change when a former dentist-turned-bounty-hunter named Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) finds him and through a witty and hilarious scene frees him, formatively then, eventually, in the literal and legal way. The two quickly become friends and partners as Django learns to be a bounty hunter. Eventually, the two hatch a plan to find and free Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). To do so, they have to find a way to trick the maliciously evil slave owner and slave fighter Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Worse yet, among the various miscreants and thieves in Candie's employ is his seeming butler and slave boss Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), who is his equal in cruelty and even sneakier and more suspicious of everyone than he is. The acting is, in all cases, superb and powerful. How these men and women brought this story to life is a true marvel and truly makes you feel like you are yourself transported back in time.

  The thing that I value the highest about this movie, above even the masterful performances and stunning scenery, is that it is both entertaining as an action-western but also educational. Much like the hardships of the Great Depression, World War II and the price paid by the Greatest Generation to ensure everything that Americans have today, the more years that pass under the bridge the more distant the days of slavery become. The more removed we become from the evil of those times, the more easily we as a society forget what slavery meant and what it was. While Django Unchained is not completely historically accurate, the portrayal of the way blacks were treated in those days is absolutely true to the nature of the beast. The slave owners convey a dedication to being vicious, heartless and cruel. They treat their slaves as less than property, less than people, less even than valuable livestock. The slaves live and die at the whim of these masters, whose only distinguishing skills are their talents at inflicting suffering and their deference to their own shortcomings. For instance, DiCaprio's character, Candie, is French but doesn't speak his own tongue and even gets offended when that language is brought up. While perhaps not suitable for small children, this movie definitely entertains while also educating a post-Roots generation. It reminds us to value the freedoms that we have today.

  Obviously, being a Tarantino movie, this isn't just a satire, comedy or revenge tale. It's definitely an action flick and, loyal to his fans, Tarantino delivers many fast-paced fight scenes, many with hysterical twists to them. For instance, I love the scene where Tarantino is abruptly blown up by dynamite. The way Tarantino always appears in his own films is reminiscent of the Great Masters, the great artists of yesteryear who had a tendency to always paint themselves into their masterpieces. To find the scene that I am talking about you just need to watch the movie - it is well worth the effort. The film is well paced, not spending too much time on Act I where Django is introduced nor on Act II where he transitions into a hero-in-training. It builds up to a climactic Act III, which is an all-out gun battle (several actually) where Django finally gets revenge on the people who hurt him, tortured his one true love and at last killed his one and only friend. Whatever else it does, this movie will please fans of both the Kill Bill films, classic westerns and also the old spaghetti westerns, which it almost seems to pay tribute to in simple terms of the number of fight scenes.

  As to picture and sound quality, these are near perfect like most new releases. The video was encoded perfectly in 1080p and I do not recall any pixel problems at any point. This was a great thing given the dramatic cinematography which included old west town sets, deep forests, mountains covered in snow, rolling plains, desert mountains and southern plantation houses. An epic film deserves epic b-roll and Django delivers. The extras that come with the Blu-ray release are tasteful and appropriate, adding some depth and background to the film. These include such discussions as the reimagining of spaghetti westerns and such. All around, these aspects of the release are very good.

  In summary, I highly recommend this movie. It educates and entertains which makes it a value to all generations and also marks a pinnacle of achievement for both its director and the actors who made it come to life. I cannot speak highly enough of the work they put into this. The best thing you can do is give it a try if you haven't already. It will make you laugh, and you may cry, but you will certainly raise your hands and cheer for the hero before it is over.",1366588800,2,5730,4.773737373737374

5260865,5,B00947NAHU,"Tarantino is still a young man. And his body of work is showing the growth of the man.
He will be one of our greatest film makers by the time he gets to his senior years.
This movie shows what Americans need to see. The casual mistreatment of slaves and the shame we Americans should feel for those that lived only 150-200 years ago. The film shows the barbaric way slaves were treated. And at the same time, a brilliant and intense movie. And with that sly Tarantino humor.
Christopher Waltz is the whole movie. This man is a marvel.
My wife usually doesn't like bloody movies but she was so into this flick, that it caused her to cry. And she stayed emotionally attached to it for a couple days.

The story of Django and Dr. Schultz is amazing and SO WELL ACTED!  Cristoph Waltz is incredible and his Oscar for this role is spot-on and well deserved.  Jaime Foxx totally embodies the character of a freed slave who now gets paid to kill (evil) white people, as they hilariously mention a few times in the movie.  Tarantino's cameo is pretty awesome, too.  And his random Aussie accent was impressively accurate!  :)  Some of the scenes were tough for me to watch.  Some because they were very graphic and bloody (duh, Tarantino) and others because it was hard to be faced with such a realistic depiction of what slave life must have looked like.

Unfortunately the experience of renting the HD version of the film and streaming it through my PS3 was not good.  The picture and sound quality were below sub-par.  There was a message that said they would use standard definition at times if the connection was lacking, but most of the time it was worse that standard.  I couldn't get the right sound level either - dialog was inaudible and then loud parts were much too loud.

I recommend adding a connection test before you rent in HD that says ""yes you can stream in HD"" or ""no, stream in standard definition"".

I've got a wired connection on my TV and don't have a problem with other connected services.

For now, I'm going to go back to streaming movies on demand through Comcast.  I'll pay the extra dollar or two for the reliable picture/sound quality.",1366588800,,863,4.594771241830065

5260890,4,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained is a fantastic piece of entertainment. While it may not offer the social commentary that many thought it should deliver, it is a wild ride and fun throughout. Quentin Tarantino's direction seems entirely purposeful & focused. He has flashed elements of ""Spaghetti Western"" themes in other films, but it all comes together in Django. This may be his best film to date.

Jamie Foxx is fantastic as Django. Quiet and flashy all at once, Foxx plays it with a subtlety I haven't seen out of him yet. Leonardo DiCaprio is great as a slimy plantation owner. Christoph Waltz steals the movie with his performance as Dr. King Schultz. Waltz is charming, hilarious, compassionate and quick with a gun. His performance was truly deserving of the Oscar.

Django Unchained flies by at 2 hours 45 minutes. You won't want to blink. Great music through-out. Tarantino's use of music from other time periods hasn't always worked for me, but in Django it only serves to update the genre for a new generation.",1366588800,,1007,4.848837209302325

5260893,5,B00947NAHU,"First off, I am extremely biased toward Quentin Tarantino. I love all his movies, I think he is a great screen writer/director. So no matter what, I usually think highly of his movies.

That being said, I never saw Django until I got the Blu-Ray, but I was slightly disappointed it. It's still a great movie but I just expected a little more from Tarantino. I can't really put my finger on it either. Christoph Waltz plays an amazing character but at times it really came off more like a shell of Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds. Leo should of won an Oscar for his role, especially when he actually cuts himself on broken glass. Great scene overall. Jamie Foxx was good, nothing special in my eyes, but that's just me. Samuel L. Jackson comes off as annoying most of the movie, but that's probably a good thing since I think that's how the character was suppose to come off as. Everyone acts well and gives it their all. Just something in the story seemed to be missing. It made sense and all, I just expected a bit more. Like I said, I can't really put my finger on it but I would say it is one of Tarantino's weaker movies in the past 10-20 years.

As far as the packaging goes, it's great. Blu Ray looks great, sound seems a little low compared to most movies, but it's not a huge deal. Everything works perfectly, can't complain.

Django is freed and then starts to work with a German bounty hunter, who is a wonderful character. When they go to Candie Land, a plantation where Django's wife is being kept, that's where the movie just fell apart for me. Leo DiCaprio is Candie, and he turns in a good performance, but there's a lot of repetitive dialogue and plodding revelations. Django allows a slave to be torn apart by dogs, which made him an unsympathetic character, whereas before that moment, he was pretty cool. Yes, there's a lot of blood - lots of juicy gun fights. Some of it is way over the top, but that's what you expect out of a Tarantino film, so I have no objection to that. The movie is very long and would have been much better about half an hour shorter, but if felt as if Tarantino lost his way and was trying hard to insert tension in the middle, and for me, it just didn't work.",1366588800,27,1028,4.276923076923077

How sad.

(Mr. Tarentino really knows how to choose the creme de la creme for his movies). However, I read that Jamie Foxx, a fine actor, said something blasphemous at the Soul Train Awards, and I thought, ""I'm NOT going to spend money on this film. I might as well see it for free when it's released On Demand via XFinity.""

However, someone I know bought the movie on DVD, and I decided to watch it, as I would not have to spend my money on it. I just finished viewing it 10 minutes ago.

I loved the movie. Mr. Tarentino knows how to write a great story, of which PULP FICTION, KILL BILL and Inglorious Basterds serve as proof. Academy Award winners Jaime Foxx & Christoph Waltz lead an all-star cast in a literal bloodbath of bounty-hunting fun. Samuel L. Jackson really steals the show in the second half of the picture, as Calvin Candie's right-hand slave. Even the original Django makes an appearance. Plus, there are several musical & visual Western references, and a slice of a certain 1970's black-cop movie for you blaxploitation lovers. If you're a lover of Quentin Tarentino, Westerns and or blaxploitation films, this is the movie for you.

My only quibble is with the pairing of God's Name with a mild curse word. ""Thou shalt not take the Name of the LORD thy God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain."" Why do film-makers feel the need to blaspheme our Lord's Name in movies these days? It's like nails on a chalk-board to me. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

I recommend this movie.

Blu Ray quality is awesome.  It isn't the best HD picture, but sound is clean and the picture itself is vibrant and pulpy.  Christoph Waltz is awesome.  The action is zany, the story is quite well told.

The digital copy included is HD, thank the heavens.  This is one heck of an entertaining movie.  It could have been cut down a little, but aside from that this is a quintessential Tarantino experience.

5260929,5,B00947NAHU,"In ""Django Unchained,"" director Quentin Tarantino combines an assortment of film genres into one neat package.  A drama about the pre-Civil War institution of slavery and an indictment of its inherent inhumanity, it is also an old-fashioned Western complete with gunfighter, a dark comedy, a splatter flick, and an action/adventure.

Former dentist and current bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) buys the freedom of a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) because he can identify the men Schultz is hunting.  As Schultz trains Django to be a deputy bounty hunter, a genuine bond forms between them.  Django learns quickly and helps Schultz kill several wanted men.

Tarantino lets scenes go on long after their point has registered.  He appears so infatuated with his own dialogue that he fails to trim the excess for artful pacing, and the movie sags far too often.

The best thing about ""Django Unchained"" is Christoph Waltz, who knows how to get the most out of his dialogue. His is the best-developed character in the picture.  Intelligent, compassionate, and ruthless, Schultz is an interesting mix.

Foxx gets us to root for Django, but there is a tentativeness in his performance, almost as if he can't bring himself to immerse himself fully in slave mentality.  He's far more convincing in the later scenes, when Django has transformed from cowering slave to self-assured gunfighter.

Leonardo DiCaprio has a meaty role as Calvin Candie, a plantation owner whose favored sport is pitting two strong slaves against each other in a fight literally to the death. Samuel L. Jackson plays Candie's elderly slave and partner in slave mistreatment.  Bruce Dern, Jonah Hill, Dennis Christopher, Russ Tamblyn, Tom Wopat, Franco Nero, James Russo, and Tom Savini all show up in small roles, and Don Johnson has a sizable part as plantation owner Big Daddy.

Special features on the two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include featurettes on the spaghetti Western tradition, production designer Michael Riva, the picture's costume designs, and the soundtrack.",1366502400,,2060,5.224924012158055

5260957,1,B00947NAHU,"The reason Quentin Tarantino has had the time to watch so many bad movies is because he doesn't like the written word. Most people of Tarantino's intelligence discover that reading is a higher bandwidth way of finding out about the world than watching straight-to-video dreck. But the auteur's learning disability has left him defensively proud that he's ill-informed about everything other than movies.

Tarantino is always infuriating. If he could get away from his adolescent revenge violent fantasies he clearly has a knowledge of film history and has the money to hire fine movie technicians. But this film is a complete waste of time and money. Films I enjoyed tend to have violent scenes in them but they do not glorify violence. I felt dirty watching this film and am embarrassed I stayed until the end. There is a weak story here with cruelty and violence beyond the pale. For those who can separate fiction from reality, yet have a peculiar bent towards violence, this movie may be manageable. For those without good filters, this is fodder for another Newtown. Sorry I gave Tarantino my money - that I wasted any of it is incidental, that I encouraged him to make more trash is deplorable. I think there is a place for violence, where it adds to the story, in this case the movie was solely about violence. Is there a plot? Yes, but it is secondary; this is about blood and guts - and I don't mean bravery. There is no redeeming aspect to the movie, don' waste your time.

If anyone else had done this movie, it would be savaged for its low quality. I don't know what this movie was supposed to be. The apparent possibilities are: 1. spaghetti western, 2. black exploitation film, 3. overblown gore fest, 4. knockoff of heaven only knows how many other movies. In the end it was some of all. But the acting, except for the good Dr. Schultz, is miserable. Everyone is a caricature.

The settings are all wrong....I mean snow-capped peaks in the South? The firearms are not period correct. You can even see the Italian proof marks on them. No effort was made to put together anything other than a 3 hour endurance test for your bladder. Oscars? What, are you on crack? The best way to watch this film is as part of a Mystery Science Theater 3000. In that way you can at least enjoy the humor.

If you have to watch it wait until it becomes available Netflix or it ends up in the $5 bins at Walmart.",1366329600,5,2407,4.551963048498846
5260958,2,B00947NAHU,"Having read some other reviews that said this was the best movie ever, I would just ask...why? I don't mind the explosions, the fact that a shotgun can spill 5 gallons of blood, or that a pistol can send a person flying 5 feet from being shot (even though Newton would argue, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction...so, the shooter would have to fly back 5 feet too) I don't mind the fact that a free/semi-free slave is more interested in saving his GF than freeing enslaved people. I DO mind the fact that this movie provided ZERO suspense and must see scenes. I am a huge fan of GT movies, but this movie was awful. Maybe it is the controversial aspect of slavery and the stain and horror that it was. Maybe it was the impending 600k lives that were lost, all which this movie does nothing to address other than the sickening overuse of the N word, which boils my skin every time I hear it.

5260965,5,B00947NAHU,"I've had a very tumultuous relationship with Quentin Tarantino's films. At first I loved him, then ""Kill Bill"" came out and since I had very recently gone through a Japanese film bender, had seen every single movie that Tarantino referenced in that movie and it confused me. I didn't know if he was paying homage or just ripping them off, sometimes frame for frame. Long story short I was pissed off at him for YEARS due to my own ignorance. Of course after seeing several interviews I came to realize that I'm an idiot and he just really, really loves film. He loves ALL of them. The hig hbrow, the low brow, everything. It's clear in his mind that a movie should be entertaining above all else. Here's the thing: dude knows his film history, perhaps better than any other director working right now. I don't know how he did it, but he has somehow come up with something very rare. Fun movies. I think I have mental road rash from all the hype that gets synthesized when a new ""blockbuster"" comes out, I watch said movie and I'm pissed off.
He doesn't make blockbusters. He makes matinee style entertainment. Yet somehow, he has managed to make art. (Somebody shoot me for saying that)
Quentin Tarantino has dropped that he's considering retiring. After ""Basterds"" and ""Django"" he indeed could retire and his reputation is guaranteed.
""Django"" oozes life from the very opening frame to the closing credits. There's so much in this film to love
Christoph Waltz is again beyond amazing. His ""dental wagon"" with the tooth on the giant black spring is hilarious and perfect.
I also have to point out his horse ""Fritz"". Fantastic.
Jamie Foxx made possibly the smartest decision of his career by doing this movie I knew he could act, but this was beyond anything he's done before.
Don Johnson knocked it out of the park.
Finally, the real tough question is, who walked away with this movie; Samuel L Jackson or Leonardo Di Caprio?
Both sterling actors and in this film it was like watching a 15 round heavyweight knockout fight. Holy god were they both amazing here.
There's also Jonah Hill, Tom Wopat, etc.
As far as the plot I can't spoil it. Just a great movie. I liked Tarantino, then I HATED him, then I came to my senses, and after ""Basterds"" he was my favorite person on earth and now with ""Django"" I'd consider under the right circumstances taking a bullet for him.

I don't have any issues with violence in movies, or the use of certain words.  Doesnt bother me at all.  I just found this movie quite amateurish.  The title song at the very beginning of the movie reminded me of Charro.  It was laughable at best.  The music in the movie clashed with the movie itself.  The acting was ok.  Leo DeCaprio is always good, he is an excellent actor.  The cinematography was nothing more than a poor man's imitation of Stanley Kubrick.  Even the editing was shoddy.

5260991,4,B00947NAHU,"Combining his style with the elements of the spaghetti western from the 1960's and 70's, Quentin Tarantino's DJANGO UNCHAINED is humorous, violent and powerful. Tarantino pays loving tribute to those films that inspired him from the pop zooms that Sergio Leone began using and that became a key part of the ""style"" of these films, to the grainy look of the film.

Featuring strong performances from the entire cast, DJANGO UNCHAINED may run a bit too long (the middle section of the film drags a bit)but the performances always keep it interesting particularly that of Oscar winner Christoph Waltz who continues to prove himself one of the best actors currently working in films.

SPOILERS:

The plot focuses on Django (Jamie Foxx)a slave separated from his wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington)who ends up assisting bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Chrisoph Waltz)in idenifying and bringing in criminals. Schultz, in turn, offers to help Django find his wife in Mississippi who is the property of Calvin Candie (Leonardo di Caprio). Candie uses his male slaves as Mandingo fighters forcing them to kill their opponents. Schultz and Django use the ruse that they are looking to purchase Mandingo fighters from Candie to gain access to his plantation and free Django's wife.

END OF SPOILERS:

The Blu-ray looks terrific with deep, rich blacks and a transfer that is state of the art. Colors positively pop and detail is exceptionally good and crisp. I didn't note any visible compression artfiacts.

The 5.1 audio mix likewise is top notch. Dialogue remains crisp and clear throughout (regardless of whether one listens to the English, Spanish or French soundtrack)and we get subtitles in English and Spanish.

While the supplements are quite good, they are also quite meager for a film like this. I was hoping for audio commentary of some sort as well as more supplements. What we do get, however, is quite good including a supplement on the production design done by the late J. Michael Riva (who died during production but did manage to do some interviews which are included here). It runs about 13 minutes

We also get a featurette on the stunts for the film (again about 13 minutes), as well as, one on the costume designs for the film. There are also two promos for the Tarantino Blu-ray collection, as well as, the soundtrack album.

We also get a DVD of the movie.

Tarantino does a good job of paying tribute to the westerns of Leone and others in this violent but entertaining western. While the supplements could have been more extensive (I would look for a possible deluxe version down the line with more supplements--I don't have any information on this but given its two Oscars for Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay as well as Tarantino's reputation, it seems likely), this is a nice looking blu-ray.

Recommended.",1366243200,3,2840,4.970464135021097
5260992,5,B00947NAHU,"DJANGO UNCHAINED is Quentin Tarantino's homage to the ""Spaghetti"" Western.  Although I personally prefer the ""traditional"" Western (i.e. those directed by Anthony Mann, Budd Boetticher, Sam Peckinpah, and the like) than the oaters of Sergio Leone, I must admit that (with a few reservations), I enjoyed Tarantino's film immensely.

The story begins in Texas two years before the Civil War.  Christoph Waltz plays Dr. King Schultz, a German-born dentist and bounty hunter who frees Django (Jamie Fox) from his slave trader owners because he is the only one who can identify a trio of outlaws that have a high price on their heads.  The two men work well together and, after Schultz gives Django his freedom, they become partners in the bounty hunting business, with the former dentist also promising to help Django find and free his wife (Kerry Washington).

That search, ultimately, leads the men to Candyland, a brutal Mississippi plantation, owned by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).  Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson, in a fine multi-layered performance), Candie's devious, albeit trusted, house slave, suspects that Schultz and Django are there for cross-purposes, and this leads to a violent climax.

DJANGO UNCHAINED is a handsomely filmed production that won well-deserved Oscars for its original screenplay and also the engaging supporting performance of Christoph Waltz.  The movie is filled with memorable scenes of action, as well as clever dialogue and moments of wry comedy, such as a scene in which a band of masked nightriders, one of whom is Jonah Hill, argue about their ill-fitting masks.  Indeed, several familiar faces (some almost unrecognizable), including Don Johnson and Franco Nero (the original Django) are present in brief roles.

Many of the well-staged action sequences, particularly those in the latter third of the picture, are so ""over-the-top"" that they are almost cartoon-like.  Yet, that is one of the trademarks of the ""Spaghetti"" Western, and since, as previously stated, this is Tarantino's homage to that form, one must accept it.

On the other hand, I do think that the picture could have easily lost fifteen minutes of its running time, particularly in the second half, and the gratuitous violence is, at times, a but too gratuitous.

Finally, I found the character of Django, both as written and as portrayed, to be rather ""unlikable"".  Yes, as a former slave, Django has the right to be angry because of all of the horrible things that have been done to him, so you root for him to save his wife and also defeat the bad guys, but that's not because you ""like"" him.  It's because the bad guys are totally despicable.

I won't be a spoiler, which is why I'm not going into detail here, but there are two moments in the second half of the film in which Django's actions are a total turn-off.  He's supposed to be the ""hero"" of this picture, but the choices he makes in these scenes are definitely not heroic.  Contrasting Waltz's character, there does not appear to be any warmth, compassion or humor in the man.

That said, I liked the movie.  If you are a fan of Westerns (or just good motion pictures) and don't mind the extensive violence, I heartily recommend it.

Extras in the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment include a trio of ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes.

5260997,5,B00947NAHU,"I didn't really know exactly what to expect from Tarantino's latest. I had watched all the trailers and was genuinely excited to see what this film brought to the table. Admittedly, I wasn't expecting much. Unlike nearly everyone else I was not all that impressed by Inglourious Basterds, I never even finished it actually. However, Django Unchained ended up being one of the best movies I have seen in years. Everything in this film comes together in one cohesive piece of storytelling that must be experienced by fans of Tarantino's work and those looking for something a bit different from the normal glut of box office malaise. The movie runs for almost 3 hours and never feels like it. It starts it out with a bang and continues on through never letting up, nor letting your guard down. The script writing is some of the best of recent years and delivers thought provoking moments as well as heart felt ones. Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz deliver fine performances as the male leads. They have what comes across as a genuine respect of one another and the situations they face. Dicaprio also delivers, in my opinion, one of his finest, and unexpected performances, as the leader of a plantation called Candie Land. This is not a film for the faint of heart, nor for those uncomfortable with vehicles relating to the horrors of slavery. I promise, however, that the latter, in the end, will not bother you as you will see soon enough that no bad deed goes unpunished. Aside from the usual, I could comment on the music, the cinematography, humor, and a myriad of other things that I found to be fantastic additions to this film. However, I will offer what I consider to be my highest praise. This is the best stuff Tarantino has done since Pulp Fiction.

5261001,5,B00947NAHU,"Where do I even start? This movie literally blew me away! I loved it. Without a doubt it's my favorite movie of all time. The entire cast was excellent. Jamie Foxx was perfect for this role. I heard Will Smith turned it down, and although I love Will Smith too, I think Foxx was meant to play this role. Django Unchained fits in nicely with Tarantino's other films. But for some reason this one stands apart.

For one, it is not as violent as some of his other movies. It's just the right amount -- not even close to Kill Bill. But there's something very unique about Django. Yes, it's about a slave and he is the hero of the story. But there's something else too. It's how the story was told.

Most people don't ""get it"" or maybe it's just not their thing. However, let's sit down and really think about this. Slavery was a very foreboding period of American history. How could we be based on freedom and equality, while at the same time subjecting people to unspeakable evils? Such a contradiction in morality would not go unchallenged forever. This movie shows just how far we've come in a relatively short period of time.

I grew up in south Georgia. I was exposed to racism. I knew it existed. I knew racist people. And yet, I had no clue just how much progress occurred before I was born. What I experienced was nothing compared to the old days.

This really got me interested in the history of slavery in America. I wanted to know what parts of Django were based on history and what parts were embellished -- which I subsequently did purchasing several books on the subject. It's amazing what a simple romanticized story can inspire.

Django Unchained is filled with vivid colorful characters like the amazing Dr. Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz, who if I am not mistaking won an Academy award for his performance.

The entire film is stimulating. You'll love to love the heroes and you'll love to hate the villains. Good deserves to triumph and evil only warrants justice. Give Django a chance. You'll love it, and even if you don't maybe it'll inspire you to examine our history and see just how far we've come as a species. Let's keep moving forward and stop dividing ourselves up into imaginary groups just to appease our egos.

Sincerely,

5261008,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino has a style that is stylish!  Few can outdo him for over the top blood and guts treatment of a subject matter that is inherently not funny.  He knows how far he can push the limits and gathers together some very fine talent in all aspects of his creation. DJANGO UNCHAINED is certainly one of his finest efforts to date, and that is saying a lot. But a writer/director who can tackle a subject as heinous as our history of slavery and show all aspects of it - as vicious and cruel and inhuman as it was - while at the same time pepper it with outlandish parody and humor is a genius of cinema.

Everyone knows the story of the film by now so a very brief statement is for openers: The time is two years before the Civil War and slavery is big business in America. Former dentist, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz who is actually the star of the film in a brilliant portrayal), buys the freedom of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), and trains him with the intent to make him his deputy bounty hunter. Instead, he is led to the site of Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by the smarmiest of villains Calvin Candie (Leonardo Di Caprio in an astonishingly fine turn out of his usual character), a ruthless plantation owner. How we get to Candyland via taking advantage of bounty hunter murders and money and finally arrive in the gross estate of Candie run by his own black master Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson in a brilliant cameo) in order to free Django's wife in a wily manner may take almost three hours but there is never a portion that is dull or that fails to introduce new highlights to the story.

In addition to the `main characters' this film abounds in spectacular cameos by such fine actors as Don Johnson, Franco Nero, James Remar, Walton Goggins, Dennis Christopher, Ato Essandoh, Sammi Rotibi, Russ Tamblyn (yes, that one!), Bruce Dern, James Russo, Michael Parks, John Jarratt, among many others,  and of course Quentin Tarantino himself. There are scenes such as a gathering of a Western KKK gang with maladaptive hoods that are incredibly hilarious, and scenes of torture and violent blood-gushing shootouts.  It all works and even for the easily offended this is a film that entertains while it reminds us of a period in our history which is unutterably shameful.

5261009,3,B00947NAHU,"Probably would've given the movie four stars if the blu ray had some halfway decent bonus features. For $23 I think we at least deserve a simple ten minute feature with the actors talking about the story, their characters and the experience of working with Tarantino. Instead all we get are three fairly lame mini docs on the stunt work, production and costume design. If we want anything more we have to fall for the production company's blatant extortion attempt by spending an extra seven dollars for the special edition copy at Best Buy. That's offensive to me.

The movie itself is entertaining in the way that a Subway sandwich is a fulfilling meal. It tastes pretty good and puts a smile on your face, but it's easily forgotten and devoid of any real substance. This is just a standard Quentin Tarantino movie with a different setting. Take Kill Bill or Inglourious Basterds and transplant them to the pre-civil war era American South and you've got Django Unchained. No real attempt on Tarantino's part to stretch his limits as a filmmaker or a storyteller. Just more of the same from his previous efforts: dark comedy, ""witty"" dialogue and gratuitous violence working together in the pursuit of fairly shallow, popcorn-movie entertainment. Unfortunately many of his previous films have dark comedy which is funnier, witty dialogue that's wittier and gratuitous violence that's far more creative. If you're a diehard Tarantino fan, you'll probably love it. If you're looking for something more from a director with his kind of talent, then you'll probably be a little disappointed.

I adore this movie because it gives pure empowerment to black people, and works to demolish the ripples of southern slave owners, which, at least because of no reparations, may be the perfect sort of balm to heal the still-wounded side of black culture.  To my understanding of filmmaking and how Quentin Tarantino works, this was the intention, just as Inglorious, everyone got their rocks off getting back at nazis and hilter.

What I didn't realize is that so many black people are not disturbed living in white culture, and feel happy, accepted and integrated, they perceive the Melting Pot and the equality more than ""living in white culture"".  Such a movie as this could possibly pull up old pains that a black person worked hard to overcome.  This is all just a consideration, and I, a white fellow, am just speculating.  One of my black friends said that to him it was just a love story, trying to get the wife back.  That he received it this way was so surprising to me.  He told me Roots was the movie that really gave some kind of recognition and justice to black people, which i haven't seen.

Still, a movie based on the indulgent slaughter of southern slave owners can't be beat.  And back in the days of slavery, a story such as this would have been the legend of the times to black people.  Leonardo is pretty painful to watch, he plays a good villain.",1366070400,2,1440,4.542635658914729

5261027,1,B00947NAHU,"OF course they (Tarantino) didn't cast a dark-skinned black woman in the role as the wife - if they did they would have made a huge comment about how dark skinned black women still live in virtual slavery today.  Lets be clear Django's wife was not originally a house slave b/c she would not have been married to Django.  There was no need to cast a light skinned black woman in this role.  But, because Tarantino is merely a commercial director interested only Hollywood accolades, he went the Beyonce route for the character of Broom Hilda.  I for one am a white person who thinks it's about time black women are treated as beautiful.  Society needs to evolve and let black women be beautiful as they are with natural hair and natural skin.

5261033,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino is one of those filmmakers who looks for trouble.  His films are always over-the-top in all hot-button aspects: violence, language, race.  DJANGO UNCHAINED is perhaps the accumulation of all of these.  It takes place in the pre-Civil War South, with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) freeing a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx).  Schultz is tracking Brittle Brothers, and only Django knows who they look like.  In return for his cooperation, Schultz offers to free Django's wife (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of the evil Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).

This is not a film for everyone.  Of course, you probably know that.  But this isn't even a film for all Tarantino fans.  It pushes the envelope; two of my friends, huge Tarantino fans, were put off.  Even I walked away from my first viewing unsure of what I felt.  I liked the film, of course--but part of me was disgusted, sick.  And after the second--and third--viewings, the latter two didn't diminish, but I was at least able to make up my mind: I was truly awed by this movie.

First off, you have the acting.  Christoph Waltz won his second Best Supporting Actor trophy, and it's easy to see why: he is the shining star in this film.  His Dr. Schultz chews up the scenery much like Hans Landa did in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS--and yet, this isn't merely a retread.  There's a deep-rooted humanity in this character, and Waltz brings that to the surface with perfect subtlety.  In the ""lead"" role (the term is debatable for much of the film), Foxx is solid--he's out-shined, but that's hardly any fault of his own.  In a supporting villainous role, DiCaprio is deliciously evil--he clearly relishes the opportunity to let loose, and though his character isn't as fleshed-out as it could've been, this is easily one of the most despicable Tarantino villains to date (according to Tarantino himself, Candie is the only character he's written that actually got to him).  Washington's supporting role is the most thankless here; she doesn't have much to do, but she gives it her all.  As Candie's right-hand man (who also happens to be a slave), Samuel L. Jackson provides another sparkling performance, second only to Waltz: Stephen, the head house slave, is truly despicable, in many ways as bad (if not worse) than Candie.  And that's not even counting the smaller supporting roles that dot the film: Don Johnson (a highlight of the movie), Jonah Hill, Walton Goggins, James Remar, Franco Nero (the original Django), Bruce Dern, Michael Parks, Tom Savini, Tarantino himself (with a god-awful Australian accent), and still others.

But as with all Tarantino films, it comes down to more than just acting.  DJANGO UNCHAINED also won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and after some thought, it's not hard to see why.  The film is provocative; we have Tarantino's trademark genre mishmash, as well as his whip-cracking dialogue and sense of humor (this film is, despite its horrors, absolutely hilarious at times), but we also have a new edge, an unsettling look into a dark period of American history.  DJANGO pulls no punches; it's gruesomely violent, even for a Tarantino film, and the worst of the violence actually occurs offscreen.  This may not be the definitive dissection of slavery and Southern culture--Tarantino, even at his best, is a pulp filmmaker--but it's nonetheless uncomfortable and thought-provoking.  Some will love it, even as a part of them is disgusted; still others will absolutely despise it.  Either reaction is understandable, and exactly what Tarantino wanted.  But do yourself a favor, and at least give the film a watch.  If it offends you, that's okay--you don't have to watch it a second time.  But maybe, just maybe, while you're being entertained by a fantastic film, you'll also find yourself thinking about history in a new, darker light.",1365984000,5,3858,4.990610328638498

How many other directors have changed the face of movie making? How many have created and defined a new genre of film that transcended above and beyond their signature style? Before Tarantino movies weren't told out of sequence, sequence was everything - story board to film. The reasons for this are obvious but Tarantino broke new ground with ""Reservoir Dogs"" proved lightening can indeed strike twice with ""Pulp Fiction' And cast his style forever in stone with both ""Kill Bill"" and ""Kill Bill 2"" - Django Unchained takes the great shame of slavery as a background much in the way ""Inglorious Basterds"" used the horror of the Nazi Holocaust.

To not see the humor in Tarantino movies is to miss the point, in a recent interview with the late and extraordinary film critic Roger Ebert Mr. Tarantino said ""  To me, the most torturous thing in the world, and this counts for 'Reservoir Dogs' just as much as it does to 'Pulp,' is to watch it with an audience who doesn't know they're supposed to laugh. Because that's a death. Because I'm hearing the laughs in my mind, and there's this dead silence of crickets sounding in the audience, you know?""

I think Tarantino fans do know , at least I would like to think so.

Django offers up a compelling story against an equally compelling background it is a brilliant film. There have been major complaints about the frequent use of the ""N-Word"" but this is part and parcel of how life was during these times and the use of that word is appropriate and real.

I cringe when I read that classic fiction like Tom Sawyer have been re-written to remove such words. It's beyond censorship because no one people have an exclusive when it comes to human suffering - and we can't sugar coat the reality of the horrors of the past by removing verbage that is today, offensive. In doing so we rob future generations of the lessons learned from the countless lives lost in the struggle for human rights and their remaining legacy to teach them.

5261051,5,B00947NAHU,"This is the story of an African man enslaved in the South of the United States, not long before the start of the Civil War and freed by a German dentist turned a bounty hunter, to help him kill white men, who are wanted by the law.

In this movie, a Pollack art pops out to a van Gogh background with the movement of the Fountains of Bellagio, in blood. Quentin Tarantino, the genius behind the screenplays of Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds, and now Django, where the `D' is silent, is the latest in the crescendo of a career that is still flying to greater heights to audiences' delight.

Two years before the Civil War, 1858, in the South, humans, who were forcibly kidnapped from Africa were traded in auction blocks. One such African, named Django (Jamie Foxx), will do anything to find the woman he loves.  Her name is Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Django is freed by a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), who is willing to help Django find his woman. In exchange for Django's help for Schultz to hunt down certain men who are wanted. That is the main artery of the story.

The tributaries of the story make for a wholesome, grotesque, horrific and sometimes stupendously (""Speak English, goddamit!"") funny moments. A case in point is when Spencer `Big Daddy' Bennett (Don Johnson) has a KKK-like group with white hoods over their heads are on their way to capture our hero, Django; they spend a long time struggling with the eye-holes on their hoods to see more clearly. The scene maybe funny, but also acts as a sad metaphor for much of the South struggling a long time with their eye-holes. It would take a long time for the South to synch up with the ""more enlightened area"" of the United States, the North. The good doctor gives a quick astronomy lesson every chance he gets by pointing to the North Star for any freedom-loving person to follow.

The climax of the movie is when Django and the doctor arrive at Calvin Candie's plantation. Candie's  brilliantly played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The scene in which Candie first appears is where two Africans are fighting to death in Candie's livingroom.

I don't see how incredibly (needlessly) violent teenage fantasies are art- and this man calls himself a genius! When Gertrude Stein did that we all rolled our eyes, but QT gets away with it? I see no difference between the man and a silly 12 year old student of mine who started signing his homework and tests ""Quentin"" - both are adolescent boys awash in pubescent fantasy. Only ""Quentin Murphy"" outgrew that phase.
These fantasy adjustment of history films make me visibly wince. Why do we need them? Are we all that stupid that we can't learn from our mistakes, however horrendous they are?

A copy of the shooting script is available free online and is fascinating to follow. Even though I knew it was coming the second and third I saw the movie, the scene where Django says this final goodbye to Schultz remains gut wrenching.
Don't know what the SFX magicians did to the torch fire in the KKK scene, but the effect is a work of art.
The scene of the plantation workers with rifles streaming onto the mansion's mezzanine firing barrages at Django flashed me back to the final scene of Butch Cassidy.

Christoph Waltz is awesome for a newcomer to American films but he has more talent than half of the people that call themselves ""talented"" in Hollywood. Together, with the direction of Tarantino, they put on one hell of a perfomance. DiCaprio throws in a lot of humorous drama and when spun together, they put on a compelling and intellectual shoot em' up and talk it out later film.

5261085,5,B00947NAHU,"I am quite picky about movies. With that said, I found Django to be one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. It is easily my favorite movie from 2012.

It's not easy for a 3 hour movie to keep your attention. When you are sad that it's over after 3 hours, that should tell you how entertaining it is. Not surprised that Tarantino won an Oscar for the screenplay. The characters are captivating, the dialogue is witty, and the story is hilarious, action-packed, and suspenseful.

What I liked about it:
1) Classic Tarantino dialogue. Even if you are not always a Tarantino fan, you will be entertained, unless you are easily offended.
2) Acting is superb. Waltz had a spectacular performance as usual, and his Oscar was well deserved. Jamie Foxx, Leo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Samuel L Jackson, and all the supporting cast were great in their roles.
3) Screenplay and directing were pieces of art. Tarantino is one of the most talented writers and directors out there. There is no one else that does what he does with a pen and camera.

What I didn't like about it:
Not much at all. Can't think of anything bad. Of course, this movie is not for young children.

I preordered this on bluray/DVD as soon as I saw it on Amazon. It's a movie that I can't wait to watch again with friends.",1365120000,4,1298,4.51063829787234

Uniform great acting all around, down to the smallest of the supporting cast.

I've never been a big Jamie Fox fan, but I thought he did a great, understated job in this role.  It was fun seeing Don Johnson on the screen again - wish his character had played a larger part in the course of the film.

But I was especially impressed with Samuel L. Jackson's turn as the treacherous brothel manager - he's been one of my favorite actors for 20 years, but this role was right up there with his performance in Pulp Fiction - actually, IMO better.  I can't believe he was not nominated for Best Supporting Actor for this.  I thought Waltz was excellent as well but I would have given the nod to Mr. Jackson between the two.

All in all, an excellent way to spend 2 hours and 45 minutes - usually I'd consider that a bit long, but in this case it was just right.",1365033600,2,947,4.198895027624309

5261093,5,B00947NAHU,"I've been a big fan of Quentin Tarantino movies for as long as he's been making them.  I always like their style, dialogue and crazy out there stories and action, but I never felt like he had more to say then he did when making this movie.  Finally, he has a historical setting which matches and in many ways excedes his extreme film making style and that alone helps bring to light a part of American history that hasn't been explored nearly enough in film, and when it has, is usually done with kid gloves on.  The most shocking parts of this film in fact are all historically accurate.  From the hotbox, to the Mandingo fighting, whips, and spiked collars, the normal Tarantino stuff (despite how good it is) with guns blazing crazy action and his quick, witty, hilarious, over the top dialogue can't even compete with the realistic/horrific images and that's a big part of what makes this movie so special and important.

Of course it's also one of the most entertaining movies to come out in recent years.  The acting, writing, directing is all spot on, and it has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.  The cinematography is also quite outstanding.  I think people have it wrong when they just call this a blacksploitation/spagetti western genre movie, it's that, but to me it's about a knight saving his princess from the castle and in fact as far as I can tell in this way, is his first real love story.",1365033600,3,1418,4.55511811023622

It would of been so much easier in my opinion if he had left Django somewhere and just asked to purchase the slave that spoke German after talking with Mr Candy for a bit.  But that would of been a terrible story, so I digress.

Anyway, a few other things didn't make sense such as the masked woman whom I am assuming was Zoe Bell as I saw her in the credits. What was the point?  Why was she looking at photos before Django came in and killed them all? Additionally.. why at the end did they send the three other newly purchased slaves to the mines?  Made no sense.

The scenes depicting blood letting were overdone and the human body doesn't hold that many gallons of blood. In fact, I'm not sure Home Depot has that many gallons of red paint.  One of Foxx's quick draws went sideways, but he hit his mark anyway.

And for those who like to call white men ""crackers"", the origin of that slang is in the movie. It actually stems from the overseer that ""cracked"" the whip on the backs of the slaves. Fortunately for most slaves, and contrary to current politically induced misdirection, few if any slaves ever had it quite as bad as what was shown on the silver screen. The (PC ""N"") word was way overused, to the point of actually being boring.

As always I don't get bothered by language in most movies, and Quentin always uses it correctly and meaningfully.  Violence was a bit over the top on some scenes, but in Italian Western they were.

5261104,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino has created a unique quest for reward and justice set in the Wild West and Deep South America.

""Django Unchained"" presents two men who go against the norms of what may be expected of typical bounty hunters from 1858 with German dentist Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and slave Django (Jamie Foxx) becoming a formidable pair.

The narrative has a straightforward flow and a distinctive facet to the plot is Django's search for his wife Broomhilda Von Shaft (Kerry Washington). Dr. Schultz makes easy work of bounty hunting and uses his cool head, good manners and clever business skills to help Django locate his wife.

It is however the ability of both Django and Dr. Schultz to switch off their scene of decency to slip under the guard of plantation owners ""Big Daddy"" (Don Johnson) and the ruthless Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Candie's vicious treatment of slaves can unsettle emotions, which can cause the viewer to sit uneasy, and Django's and Dr. Schultz's ability to disconnect compassion contributes to the ferocity of some scenes.

The film ends with just a few on their feet but the skills Dr. Schultz taught to Django allow for sharper wits to prevail during the most precarious of times.

Still worth owning, though, particularly when Tarentino is building suspense in a scene like only he can do.  It's a time bomb that you know is going to explode, but you just don't know exactly when.  DiCaprio does some of his best work here, playing a layered villain who is a villain nonetheless and one you can't wait to see meet his downfall.  Also, huge props to Samuel L.

With this movie Quenton doesn't let us.  Not only that he adds another to the genres, minus the genuine retro charm of the originals.

I give it 2 stars for the rather interesting first half of the movie.  Until it reached the last half hour I was ready to give it 4 stars.  But excuse me, Samuel Jackson as head butler of a slave plantation?  Breathing in DiCaprio's ear every two seconds at dinner and sounding a lot more like Sanford (of Sanford and Son) than anything representing a realistic portrayal of the era.  Oh yeah, I forgot: realism not on the menu!  But once the movie degenerated into the ""Dusk Till Dawn"" video game massacre (that we've already seen how many billion times in Hollywood movies?), I didn't care.

This movie reminded me of all my favorite Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns from the 60's and 70's.  Personally I never felt like there was a dull moment in the entire movie, between the action and the dark humor you will keep wanting more.

Acting  5/5
The entire cast did a fantastic job with this movie, but I was the most impressed with the job Leonardo Dicaprio had done.  Leo has had a wide range of roles, but not one quite so evil as his character in Django Unchained. I thought it would be hard to hate my favorite actor in a movie, but it didn't take long before I hated Leo's character.

Story  5/5
A very original story line featuring strong characters, dark humor, and a touching revenge/love story.

Effects 5/5
Like most Tarantino movies this film features a lot of blood and killing, but it works in into the movie very well, even adding humor into the fighting scenes.

To be honest its a simple plot, Christoph Waltz is a bounty hunter looking for two murdering brothers and gets help from Jamie Foxx who use to live on their plantation. The terms are if Jamie helps him then Christoph must help Jamie find his wife who he was separated from. I recommend this movie to any Tarantino fan and anyone who enjoys good story telling and cinema.",1363651200,10,877,4.522012578616352
5261123,1,B00947NAHU,"First off, let me say that I previously loved or at least liked (Kill Bill Vol 2 being kinda mediocre ending to the great Kill Bill1 and deathproof being kinda weak) most if not all of Tarantino's films.  Let's face it, he pays homage (or re-imagines) past movies and genres and adds his often witty dialog and violence which in turn garners him acclaim like no other and develops him a hard nosed fanbase who will inevitably defend this movie to the bone, as racist and weak as it is. My problem with this movie is not so much the glorification of racist views and language as much as it is the fact that this is a complete work of fiction which is being treated as if it has historical merit.  If that wasn't bad enough, In an age where many black actors are pigeon holed into either Tyler Perry-esque nonsense or playing slaves I really just find it boring and cliche. Django brought nothing new to the table. The dialog which is often witty was not in many instances, especially for the black characters Jamie Fox and Kerry Washington (who hardly spoke) but was the most well written for Waltz and the charismatic villains DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson....which brings me to my next issue: The movie was sold as Django ""unchained"" but ultimately he was the most boring person in the film and all other roles (mainly the roles of plantation owner or uncle-TOm villain) were far more fleshed out and better written which is sad because as the main, shouldn't Django be the one we pay attention to and root for? I found it very uneasy watching this in a theater full of white people and hearing the jarring responses from the audience mostly disdain when Django (remember, the HERO) was shooting white southerners and then laughter and glee when either Candie or Samuel L's character went on a rant etc. Which to me is akin to watching Schindler's list and rooting for the Nazis. Although Tarantino touched on Nazi's and Jews in Basterds movie, he did it differently. Nazis were no doubt the villains and he made the Basterds very likable and who you were rooting for, he did not get that across in this movie.  There was a certain way he gingerly handled the Jewish plight in Basterds that he did not handle the plight of slavery in in Django. It was very ham-handed and sloppy in terms of character connection and emotion.  If the meat and potatoes of likable dialog all go to the most racist despicable villains in a movie, don't try to fool an audience into thinking this is tale where the black hero gets revenge when it is merely a showcase for your love of writing and fleshing out racist views masked as witty writing.

I wonder if the shoe were on the other foot, e.g. he revisited the holocaust and made a revenge flick parody of that atrocity; if it would be so well received and well liked by critics and the Oscar academy. Now, I can already feel people citing Inglurious Basterds as an example and saying, well he did, but no, the tone of that movie without a doubt painted Nazis in a bad light where I feel Django was like a love letter to southern racism and slavery, often justifying it as 'the way things were' to the effect of even assaulting viewers with the N-word to excessive amounts. This is 2013, we have a black president, but a movie like this will always come along and just slap any major African American achievement or stride for TOTAL equality in the face by glorifying and justifying horrific events during the times of slavery and also becoming so widely popular and glorifying racist words and treatment of a people.  After the movie I felt as if I walked out into a sea of Calvin Candies and it was a terrifying feeling to look around and feel as if I was the only person who had this view. Surely, the reviews and media will further scrutinize and examine this film for what it is right? Well, that did not happen. The Politically correct movement of the late 90's and early 2000's has given way to a new age where now, people revel in a return to the most despicable and fiendish rhetoric and rants just to get famous. I nod to today's 'comedians' where the clever joke writing takes a backseat to shock value (which is often racist) and puts them on the map, garnering attention. Attention in this day and age is not bad or good, it is essential and the more eyes on you means that someone somewhere will offer you money to continue to be controversial.

This is what Tarantion has/is doing at this point.",1363651200,24,4446,4.488257107540173
5261124,4,B00947NAHU,"Django brings a different language to a story we have heard a million times before. Quentin Tarantino is brilliant in his ability to bring humor and clarity to a serious and dramatic story. Quentin's rendition of history makes it relatable to all audiences and not only African Americans.

The leading role is played by Jamie Foxx who is in search of his wife who has been sold by a slave master. He begins this journey with this corky doctor who is also a bounty hunter. The doctor makes him a deal of helping to find his wife if he will work with him. While on this journey they encounter some major slave traders who also have his wife held captive. Django must come up with a plan that will save the woman he loves but also helps him to get out freely as well.

I enjoyed the movie for the most part. There are some scenes that are overly dramatic and the language is rather vulgar. If you are familiar with Tarantino's style then he is at his rarest form. I will say this is one of those movies you will either hate it or love it. Very entertaining from beginning to end. Several fight scenes throughout the movie. This movie is for adult eyes only.",1363478400,5,1154,4.337962962962963

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

 With clever aplomb, Quentin Tarantino has turned the Spaghetti Western on its head and created a vision of the pre-Civil War South and Wild West, much more like it probably was: a landscape replete with the nightmare images of slavery, highlighting a society permeated by racism at every turn. When he decides to be 'serious', Tarantino 'gets it' and proffers up a series of disturbing images, scenes and characters that prove on a certain level, he's read his history.

The opening scene, where a group of male slaves in chains are being transported by the Speck Brothers, introduces us to the brutal world of slavery. One notes the horrible condition these men are in and the sadistic way they're treated by the racist Ace and Dicky Speck. The brutal way in which the slaves take revenge on Dicky, after his horse falls on him after being shot, suggests their actions are an understandable reaction to years of terrible oppression.

Tarantino is hardly finished. There are scenes of slaves on the way to the slave market in shackles, often forced to wear gruesome metal head locks that resemble the kind of restraints one associates with Hannibal Lecter in 'Silence of the Lambs'; a terrifying mob of hooded racist night riders, obvious precursors of the Ku Klux Klan, on their way to take revenge on Tarantino's protagonists, Dr. Schultz and Django; Mandingo fighting where blacks are forced to basically kill one another in the wrestling ring while racist whites bet on the fight for sport; and the copious use of the 'n-word' throughout the film (Tarantino doesn't care about offending modern day sensibilities--he realizes that the overuse of that demeaning word, was commonplace during those times!).

Tarantino is at his best when he comes up with a character like Calvin J. Candie, the racist plantation owner, so winningly played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Candie is not just your average racist brute as are so many of the other characters in the film. Candie represents a racist with intelligence, as he toys with those he lords over, sadistically deriving pleasure through both physical and psychological means. In perhaps the most disturbing scene in the film, he coaxes one of his top Mandingo fighters down from a tree, after the poor, broken man confesses he's no longer able to fight and then sics a pack of savage dogs on him, tearing the man to pieces. Candie also is shown to have much in common with the Nazis in the 20th century, as he pontificates about what he believes to be the genetic inferiority of the black man.

After all this clever scene setting as well as some brilliant writing in his portrait of Candie, why does Tarantino undermine his story by resorting to the same kind of puerile wish fulfillment fantasy, we saw in full relief in his previous effort, 'Inglorious Basterds'? The answer can be found in the examination of Tarantino's two protagonists, Dr. Schultz and Django.

While Christoph Waltz proves to be highly entertaining as Dr. King Schultz, the witty dentist turned bounty hunter, one must recognize that Schultz, personifies Tarantino himself. Not only does Tarantino want to be on the winning side, but he must prove, as a white Italian, that he is entirely sympathetic to black people and is 100% against racism. So here he grafts this 21st century sensibility on to his Schultz character, who is such a friend of black people, that he'll not only make Django his partner but go out of his way and risk his life, to help Django save his wife from the clutches of the very dangerous Calvin J. Candie.

It hardly seems believable that Schulz would be able to save himself in that scene where he appeals to the Marshal's good will. I would imagine that after shooting the sheriff, the Marshal and his posse wouldn't have been in the mood to listen to Schultz's story that he was a bounty hunter, and would have shot them both on the spot. I was unable, however, to suspend my disbelief when it came to Schultz making Django his assistant, and parading around, ensuring all those racist townspeople got their comeuppance. It might have made Tarantino feel good that his white liberal Schultz and super-human racist killer, Django, were so successful, but the reality of the 1858 South, was quite different (Think about John Brown's fate after attempting to start a slave revolt when he raided Harper's Ferry).

If Schultz is a stand-in for today's white liberal, Django represents the flip side: militant black people's wish fulfillment. Spike Lee is completely right that 'Django' trivializes the history of slavery (I wish only he saw the film so he can back up his beliefs with specific detail). When Django kills Candie's sister and Samuel L. Jackson's Uncle Tom, Stephen, and then blows up the plantation, it gives those unfamiliar with American history the wrong impression. Quite the opposite occurred: there was little opportunity for blacks to revolt against the slave master; and when such revolts did occur, they were brutally suppressed.

By indulging himself with these revenge fantasies, Tarantino may be encouraging ignorant young people to resort to violence. Some of these young people may erroneously equate the racist behavior seen in 'Django' with people of today. In our own time, is it right to blame Germans born after World War II, for the crimes committed by their grandparents?

Ultimately, Tarantino succeeds when he transforms the Spaghetti Western into the nightmare reality of a pre-Civil War racist world. But by also accepting the stock conventions of that genre, with all of its attendant juvenile trappings (e.g. one bloodbath after another), coupled with his need to be on the 'winning side' and indulging in revenge fantasies, Tarantino ends up appealing to the baser instincts of those who deny over 150 years of progress and hark back to an age that no longer exists.",1363305600,16,5918,4.9188376753507015

5261128,4,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained starts as Dr. King Schultz (Oscar-winning Christoph Waltz), a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter, frees a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) in a very bloody way. Then the doctor and Django form a bounty-hunting duo, and plan to rescue Djangos wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a sadistic plantation owner Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).

The 165-minute film is overlong and the story does not really convince, but Tarantinos new film benefits from the strong performances from the leads. As in the directors previous film, Christoph Waltz dominates the films earlier part, but as the film progresses, the focus shifts slowly from his character to Jamie Foxxs Django transforming into a deadly gunslinger.

The name of Django is something familiar to fans of so-called spaghetti westerns including the 1966 movie Django directed by Sergio Corbucci and starring Franco Nero (who briefly appears in Unchained). More recently Tarantino himself appeared in a Japanese western movie Sukiyaki Western Django. All these trivia facts (and many other references to other films) may prove cineaste and filmmaker Tarantinos love of the genre, though I wish he could have spent more time in fleshing out Kerry Washingtons character.

Though the film is not as revolutionary as the same directors trend-setting ""Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino's blood-soaked new film is entertaining.",1362873600,3,1418,5.586046511627907
5261129,4,B00947NAHU,"L'enfant terrible, Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds), has specialized integrating his encyclopedic knowledge of exploitive movies into reinvented, genre films stocked with top actors and highlighted by dialogue enriched scenes.  The ultimate revenge tale in the guise of a slavery drama morphed into a western, Django Unchained is a highly entertaining adventure with a heavy dose of violence.

It is the pre-Civil War South where cruel plantation owners treat slaves inhumanely, and guns rule the landscape.  A former dentist, Dr Schultz (Christoph Waltz), is a bounty hunter and seeks his quarry by enlisting the aid of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx).  It seems bounty hunting is a very lucrative profession, and it facilitates Django's freedom and a means to search for and rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), from a wealthy slave owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). As Schultz and Django devise a plan to win Hildy's freedom, Candie, who relies on the counsel of his slave-confident, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), begins to suspect a ruse and with time running out, it leads to an explosive, bloody end.

Although his films tend to function and be appreciated for their parts rather than the whole, there are, of course, the Tarantino trademarks.  He knows how to build a scene, and part of the fun is the delicious interplay among the key characters.  As in most of his films, his characters are put in situations where there is an inevitability, a destiny if you will as the tension and looming threat of violence gets unbearable at times particularly in the climactic dinner scene.  He also has a couple of scenes early on which are meant to fool the audience in which things appear one way but are really a clever misdirection.

Foxx is quite the stud as the determined former slave, and DiCaprio is cast convincingly against type. Yet it is Waltz who shines here, and he makes the most of a role written for him.

As he has done in all his previous films, Tarantino has resurrected former stars and character actors in numerous supporting roles.  Part of the fun is trying to recognize a face under heavy makeup.  Try identifying Michael Parks, Tom Savini, Robert Carradine, Bruce Dern, Russ Tamblyn, Don Stroud, Franco Nero (star of the original titled film), Don Johnson, Dennis Christopher, or James Remar.

The film is heavily influenced by spaghetti westerns with the long stares and moody musical score.  The action scenes are brutal and at times over the top; when has it not been so in a Tarantino film? One day perhaps, he should make a more intimate, gentle film to prove his versatility (like David Lynch demonstrated in The Straight Story).

At 165 minutes, the film could use a bit leaner running time, but it is good fun if you aren't put off by the  periodic, graphic violence.  Tarantino may be a film geek with a nasty streak, but he definitely knows how to put together engaging, crowd pleasers, even if much of the material is cleverly recycled from older, obscure films.  He has devised a crackerjack piece of entertainment, and while he says he wants to make a very limited amount of films in his career, if they continue to be as popular and well written as this and his previous work, we may have to wait a couple years or more for the next one.  For his fans, it will be worth the wait.",1362873600,4,3370,4.829565217391305
5261130,4,B00947NAHU,"Why you shouldn't see it:

 If you've seen Inglourious Basterds and thought once was enough, you're not likely to find much worth reviewing here. This is another of Quentin Tarantino's fantasy revenge flicks, of the sub-genre that rails on systemic injustices.

Beyond that, there are a number of pretty obvious reasons that will probably jump out at you right off the bat, even if you haven't seen the movie. Most of these reasons boil down to whether or not you are comfortable with confronting humanity's occasionally (or frequently, if it's the deep south in the 1850's) ugly nature. This is a movie that makes white Americans uncomfortable with being white Americans in much the same way that Basterds probably made German non-Jews uncomfortable with being German non-Jews.

This film unabashedly displays outrageous racism and almost cartoonish violence (frequently using the high visual contrast of bright red blood spattering on bright white set pieces). Two things that, like it or not, are prevalent recurrences in the way mankind has conducted itself through the years. If you like to close your eyes, cover your ears, and sing ""The Song That Never Ends"" when you're confronted with either of these things, because you like to think happy thoughts about the good ways in which people treat each other, this movie is not for you, and you will likely find it a tremendous waste of your time. Unless you really like singing that particular song, I guess.

Why you should see it:

It should be noted, however, that the way that Django and Basterds make an individual want to check his cultural baggage at the door is wholly unrelated to the way in which movies like Amistad and Schindler's List do the same thing. While the two Spielberg movies make you take a magnifying glass to our past somewhat against your will, the two Tarantino movies are more like your charismatic buddy who comes along and says, ""Hey, check this out.""

Django takes American slavery, shines a bright light on it, and hands it a microphone so that it has the opportunity to show what it's about. In a way that possibly only Tarantino can do it, the movie takes a dark subject matter and turns it so ridiculous that the audience can't help but have fun with it. Everyone in the theater found a measure of satisfaction each and every time a slaver died, regardless of the colors involved. The movie also adds a sort of vindication for those of you who saw Basterds and would have rooted for Colonel Hans Landa if not for your disparate stances on the right of Jewish people to remain living. Pretty much the same character seems to travel back in time to strangely play a more (his name is Dr. King) or less (he's a white German) proto civil rights advocate whom you can really get behind and cheer along.

There are a couple enjoyable moments that sort of jarringly take you out of the main thread of the story with their surprising cameos and/or humorous observations on otherwise revolting situations. I'm not necessarily a fan of Jamie Foxx or Christoph Waltz, as I find the former unmemorable and the latter both lacking in range and somewhat creepy in the one role that he has settled into. But in this movie, Foxx does a good job of taking his dynamic role and morphing the character throughout the course of his story arc, and Waltz is more fun when he's ""on your side"" (which, ironically, is the side that kills people like you if you're white). I will say, however, that the acting highlight of the movie for me is Leonardo DiCaprio going largely against his type of controlled and almost closed characters in other movies to boisterous and cartoonishly evil in this one.

In Short:

I had originally started writing this post by going on a long rant about Quentin Tarantino when I realized I hadn't really said anything about the movie itself. And maybe that's the point. Most of you already have a pretty good idea whether or not you enjoy Tarantino movies. I ended up giving this one an 8 out of 10, and I recommend it as a good watch.

Exceptions to the recommendation:
- if you're someone who knows for sure that you just don't appreciate QT's work (which probably means that you just don't appreciate film and the history thereof (and may God have mercy on your soul));
- if you're one of those aforementioned people who sometimes struggles with harsh realities;
- if you're someone who sometimes struggles with revenge fantasies;
- if you hate seeing Quentin Tarantino try (active word) to act;
- if you're a white person who sometimes forgets to apply your filter and uncontrollably repeats things that you think are funny;
- or, by extension, if you're an impressionable young child... hold off for a bit, and I'll explain when you're older.",1362873600,,4741,4.727602905569007
5261131,5,B00947NAHU,"I knew going in to Django Unchained that I was in for a Tarantino movie and all that entails. I knew thered be clever dialogue, over-acting, Samuel L. Jackson, an awesome mish-mosh soundtrack, revenge, a cameo by the writer/director, and oceans of blood. I wasn't disappointed.

Jamie Foxx channeled a simmering intensity coupled with dead pan smart a$$ ala Clint Eastwood, Leonardo DiCaprio and Don Johnson were over-the-top bad guys, Samuel L. was, well, his usual self, and Christoph Waltz steals the show as a German bounty hunter. Unfortunately, the beautiful Kerry Washington is under written, but there are really no strong female characters in this movie at all.

The film is nearly three hours and is probably about thirty minutes too long, but it still moves quickly enough that you aren't squirming in your seat. Additionally, in the best western tradition, there are breathtaking shots of scenery to balance out the trademark explosions of blood and guts. It gets a bit intense with a few scenes, but again, you're watching a Tarantino flick, not the latest from Nancy Meyers.

Aside  Im surprised so many took time to review this movie and rail about how silly and unbelievable it was. I didn't see a based on a true story line in the opening credits.

5261133,4,B00947NAHU,"""Django Unchained, along with his predecessor Inglourious Basterds, incorporates the ultra-violent, rebellious/anarchic, and ""hero of our times"" kind of concept that have been prevalent in Roman and Greek mythology- someone who stood for something. In addition, it pays nods to classic westerns and exploitation cinema of the '60s and '70s from Sergio Leone (as obvious as the Ennio Moricone name in the opening credits), Clint Eastwood (The Outlaw Josey Wales and Dirty Harry come into mind), Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch and Straw Dogs both have a vigilante's drive), and films like Shaft signifying Black struggle. Slavery being the main issue here is treated in a rather uneven way but because this film is fictional by all means and the ""hero"" representation that is Django elevates the film into steering unexpected territory. Don't expect coming in seeing Roots or The Help which deal with similar issues but don't contain the graphic idealism that is encrypted in Django. It isn't fair to say about what is good and what's bad compared to his other works but it certainly made me surprised and the dialogue, while tiring to a certain point, maintains its witty banter and the film altogether works like a very dark comedy that is funny yet disturbing at the same time. In terms of violence, this isn't as worse or any different from Kick-Ass or Afro Samurai which all lean on exploitation and sensationalism to the highest order- this holds at least some historical context. On other grounds, the performances were stellar especially from Foxx, DiCaprio, and Waltz and the editing, cinematography, and ""some"" of the choice of music (aside from the uneven hip-hop) are exceptional to what it is trying to be.""",1362873600,,1717,5.049295774647887

5261136,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino makes movies for me. Or more acutely he makes movies for people like me, people who love old movies especially the more dubious genre fare. So few people understand our love of these movies, which is why it is so easy to feel that Tarantino makes movies for the individual and not the masses, but he has established a very loyal fan base and has manage to achieve a success. All the while doing it his way and never compromising, making his success all the more extraordinary.  He has been tearing up the establishment for three decades now, truly an iconoclast.
 Django Unchained, his loving tribute to the Italian westerns and the blaxplotation western hybrids that starred Fred Williamson and Jim Brown, is no exception. In fact it is exceptional in it's own brilliant, original, often very funny, lurid way that only Tarantino could manage to pull off.
 This is Tarantino's most brutally violent movie, it is bound to turn some people off just on that, it is sure to offend (I'm looking at you, Spike Lee) and pushes the boundaries of good taste and entertainment. Yet, it manages to convey the cruelty and evils of slavery better than just about any movie I have ever seen.  This button pushing issue seems to be better left alone by our cultural mentality, but along with Spielberg's Lincoln, `tis is the season.
 At times as wickedly comical as Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles, but never mocking and never loosing sight of the seriousness of it`s vicarious subject matter.. It's cool, it's thrilling, it's thought provoking and instantly quotable, in other words, it is just what we've come to expect from the maverick director, who also wrote the original screenplay.
 Tarantino's take on the west, or more specifically the spaghetti western,  is unlike anything we've seen before. Like some of his other films, it plays fast and loose with historical accuracy, but a lot of productions have done that in the past, still few as blatant as Tarantino`s reimaging.
 Told in a more straight forward and linear fashion than is usual for Tarantino, perhaps the untimely death of his regular editor Sally Menke had something to do with this, this marks his first film without her knowledgeable and distinct editing style. It as much of a mystery and full of surprises as any other of his movies, for quite a while I was happy to be uncertain of where the film was heading.
 Always entertaining, always fresh, vivid and original. Tarantino has taken the best the genre has had to offer and added his usual clever dialogue, keen photography (by Robert Richardson) and a liberal dose of interesting music all on an epic scale few movies today even approach.
 It's not unusual for a new Tarantino to be as full of an experience as Django Unchained is. Yet, it never is never anything other than a welcome refreshment among so many drab movie going experiences. It is extravagant and exaggerated, realistic and absurd all at once.
 Working with a splendid cast headed by a stoic and coolly powerful Jamie Foxx in a role said to have been written for Will Smith, but Foxx will make you glad of his casting. He is everything a gun slinging bad ass need to be, and has as much charisma as the star of Wild Wild West  does on his best day.
 However, as with most of Tarantino's films, it is the supporting cast that really sizzles. It is so fantastic in fact that it is hard to tell just who manages to steal the show. The Austrian actor Christoph Waltz, who deservedly won an Academy Award for QT's masterful loose historical epic Inglorious Basterds, is a delight as Dr. King Shultz, a wily German born dentist turned bounty hunter. Tarantino could easily spend the rest of his career just writing roles for this hugely talented and charismatic actor. It also great for Waltz, who with films like dismal the Green Hornet and Paul W.S. Anderson's misguided interoperation of the Three Musketeers, hasn't been having the best of luck finding a role worthy of his vast talent in Hollywood productions.
 Much has been made of Leonardo Di Caprio's villainous turn here, and rightly so. as Calvin J. Candie, a cocky, self-centered plantation owner, this is Leo as we've never seen him before. He is vile and lovably so, this is Di Caprio's sharp turn into character roles, which I hope to see him in more of.
 Samuel L. Jackson, marking his fifth collaboration with Tarantino, sixth if you count the Tarantino penned True Romance. As Steven, a superbly written villain who thinks he's smarter than everyone else. As blinded by hate and as bigoted towards his own race as anyone else in this movie. Jackson gives a finely tuned and somewhat tricky performance depth and credibility.
 Also good is Don Johnson, looking like Colonel Sanders, as a hot tempered southern dandy. Johnson is starting to make a surprising move into smartly chosen supporting roles.
 A string of colorful cameos also add to the pleasure of the movie, especially for fans of  the genre and other cult film oddities. there is the original star of Django himself Franco Nero providing ""friendly participation"".  Also a very funny Jonah Hill, as well as Bruce Dern, James Russo, Tom Wopat, Don Stroud, Lee Horsley, Michael Parks, John Jarret, Russ Tamblyn, his daughter Amber, Tom Savini, Zoe Bell and even a badly miscast Tarantino, himself adding to the fun. James Remar, a cult favorite actor, plays two small roles.
 Tarantino's finely tuned use of music should also be singled out. He has always had a good ear, the music mostly recycled from old movies also, has been as colorful as his writing and smartly placed as his fine casting. Here we get everything and everyone from Tupac to Johnny Cash, as well as lots of beautiful Ennio Morricone tunes and other spaghetti western themes cheekily used through out. This is one soundtrack album worth listening to.
 As a movie I couldn't have been more pleased and entertained by Django Unchained. Even when challenged, uncomfortable and feeling a little bit of white guilt, at a mammoth running time of two hours and forty-five minutes, I would happily had some more. I left the film pleased,  smiling, and like most of Tarantino's oeuvre, I can't wait to see it again.

5261137,5,B00947NAHU,"I went to the movies to watch this and what an excellent movie experience!  As usual, Tarantino puts as much into the music as he does the movie.  Waltz is his usual academy award winning self.  Tarantino continues with his unique camera angles and comedic outbreaks intermingled with extreme violence and historical spots.  My favorite is the KKK (well, preKKK since they were officially not called that during that time) scene with Don Johnson.  This is worth watching.  However, if you are interested in the more, sugar coated history like Gone with the Wind, then this is not your film.  Expect the bloody violence that Tarantino is known for.  Not only do I own the soundtrack, I look forward to buying this film when it is released next month.  Django is sure to become another Tarantino classic.",1362096000,3,802,4.795620437956204

Less than a decade before the Civil War, Django (a slave portrayed by Jamie Foxx) is being escorted, in chains, by his masters, the Speck brothers. They are traveling through a remote, wooded area when they encounter someone unexpected. Their unexpected company is former dentist, Dr. King Schultz. Schultz (portrayed by Christoph Waltz) is looking for a slave formerly owned by men he wishes to find. The slave, it turns out, is Django. The Specks have no intention of surrendering Django to the doctor and make that point very clear. The doctor then kills one Speck brother and leaves the other alive but seriously wounded. Schultz (Waltz) then informs Django that if he can identify the men he's searching for, whom Schultz is hunting in hopes of securing a bounty, and aid in their capture, Schultz will grant Django his freedom and give him $75 and a horse. Schultz also reveals that he despises slavery as a concept. Once the men Schultz was after are found and dealt with, Schultz tells Django that, as he has never given anyone their freedom before, he feels a certain responsibility. The two men become colleagues, hunting fugitives for money. In addition, the former dentist offers to help Django find the one thing he really wants: his wife Broomhilda. Broomhilda (also a slave, portrayed by Kerry Washington) was named by her original owners who were German, like Schultz. She was left scarred by her owners, who were also Django's, and then the two were auctioned separately. After a few inquiries, they learn that Broomhilda is now in the possession of well-known plantation owner and Francophile Calvin Candie and residing with Candie on the plantation counter-intuitively referred to as Candie Land.

While some people worship Tarantino's body of work, generally speaking, I can take it or leave it. I didn't like Pulp Fiction, or Reservoir Dogs, thought Inglorious Basterds was decent but overrated, but loved Jackie Brown. Jamie Foxx, on the other hand, has proved his skill time and time and again and, while not every film he's appeared in could be considered quality, the fault rarely, if ever, lies with him. As for Waltz, it is refreshing to see him portray a character with redeeming qualities and he does so very well. DiCaprio, contrastingly, tends to play characters that are, or are at least meant to be, likable. Despite being well-mannered, Calvin Candie is anything but. Even so, his performance is masterful. Critics who dislike this film have come at it from both sides. Some take issue with the film for not depicting slavery seriously. Others see the depiction of Caucasians as villains as the continuation of some sort of disturbing trend. Of course, the fact that Christoph Waltz portrays one of the protagonists would seem to contradict that but, why let logic interfere with an argument? As for what I think, those who suffer typically deserve it and slave masters are shown as vicious because, more often than not, they were. I liked this film and I can't imagine why those who can see this film with an apolitical eye wouldn't.",1361664000,3,3248,4.871609403254973
5261145,5,B00947NAHU,"The film is a classic Tarantino film.  It has its share of vulgar language, violence, and a lack of political correctness.  Hopefully you've seen his films before so you know what to expect.  Christoph Waltz makes this movie.  He is simply amazing and if you enjoy him in this and haven't seen Inglorious Bastards you really need to check it out as well.

The downside of this movie is the length.  It is very long and there is a long drawn out set of sequences before getting to Leo that probably could have been trimmed down.  Saving that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it all.  This was the kind of movie where I was glad to see if keep going, but I could see where the runtime could bother some people.",1361404800,3,703,4.312977099236641
5261146,5,B00947NAHU,"I have to admit - when I went to see Django Unchained I was one of those people who thought it was going to be 'Roots'-like because of all of the critics' reviews.  When I saw Spike Lee trashing it when he hadn't even seen it thought - I had to go see it just to see what in the world all the fuss was about.  Even though I've seen and loved all of Tarantino's movies - even the movie 'Curdled' which is an ultra-gory Tarantino-produced film - I wasn't expecting Django to be anything like his other movies.

I was pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained during the almost three-hour movie.  There was never a dull moment, and while I agree with some other critics that the female presence was practically nil, you have to put into perspective that he was making a classic Spaghetti Western in the style of the original 'Django', and they often didn't have a strong female presence.

The story was lively and engaging - kudos to Tarantino for the excellent writing - and the cinematography was crisp and well-detailed.  Tarantino didn't overdo it with goriness or action sequences in my opinion, and because the acting was top-notch across the board, it was so easy for the audience to get into the movie and stay there through the end.

As to Spike's criticism - see the film before you open your big yap - it is not insulting to our ancestors - it is a piece of entertainment set in the time of slavery, that appropriately uses period costumes, sociology of the time and yes - language including the 'N' word to set the scenes.

This is a film that gives me hope that one day we can distance ourselves as people of color from the stigmas and negative connotations of our histories.  Since we people of color can't seem to make movies that get us out of that 'slave mentality', I suppose we're at the mercy of others to do that for us - thankfully Tarantino has taken us a step in that direction.",1361318400,5,1907,4.425714285714286
5261147,3,B00947NAHU,"I realize that I'm going to be in the minority when I say this, but DJANGO UNCHAINED is essentially two movies locked into one.  The first 75 minutes tell a highly entertaining tale of a quest, in which Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and the eponymous Django (Jamie Foxx) assume the role of bounty-hunters in search of Django's enslaved spouse Hilde (Kerry Washington).  The story is tightly constructed, with intertextual nods to 1960s spaghetti westerns, late John Ford - perhaps even a nod to Mel Brooks' BLAZING SADDLES.  The interplay between the two protagonists is well sketched in, with Schultz gradually helping Django acquire self-confidence as well as discovering a unrivaled talent as a shooter.  There are some extremely funny lines delivered absolutely deadpan by the actors, with notable cameos from Don Johnson as a ruthless plantation owner.

With Leonardo DiCaprio's entrance as Calvin Candie into the action, however, the film falls apart. The two protagonists find Hilde, and try to forge a deal with Candie for Hildy's release; however their plans are discovered.  The rest of the film tells an increasingly ludicrous tale as Django emerges triumphant in a series of bloodbaths.  The story becomes not only historically inaccurate, but it is actually demeans the characters it purports to support - i.e. the African-Americans.  Tarantino suggests that they have to assume the kind of superhuman traits associated with white comic-book characters, rather than develop identities of their own.

DJANGO UNCHAINED is worth watching, if only for the two central performances.",1361318400,7,1590,5.328
5261148,5,B00947NAHU,"This was by far my favorite movie of 2012, which is saying a lot when there were so many other greats (check out Dark Knight Rises, Lawless, The Avengers, Ted). I've NEVER paid to see a movie twice in theaters, yet I did for this one. Movies are different, so I won't say it's the best movie of 2012, but it was definitely the most entertaining. Nearly 3 hours long and there's not one boring moment through the entire thing, which is a remarkable feat in my opinion. Most movies that long have to have slow parts to develop the story or characters, which isn't bad. Yet 'Django Unchained' was able to do that effortlessly without skipping a beat. It's FULL of action, adventure, & comedy- even with the true base story on romance.

I initially heard some complaints of the use of the 'N' word, but that's just something I found more surprising about this movie. That the massive use of the word didn't bother me (it usually does). The movie just takes you back into the time and place & desensitizes you to the word, like it's just any other normal curse word. It probably also helped that Jamie Fox & Samuel Jackson used the word just as much as anyone else. As well, the violence & gore is almost comical at times. It's a MOVIE. A GREAT ONE.

I'm not even a big Tarantino fan, but this is his best since Pulp Fiction in my opinion. I can't say I was surprised it was going to be good either. I was already excited for it, and knew it'd be good with great actors like Jamie Foxx & Leonardo DiCaprio in it... I just didn't realize how good :)",1361232000,6,1543,4.298969072164948
5261149,5,B00947NAHU,"Django Unchained is a movie everyone should see. It truly has something for everyone, and works well on several different levels. This review is a guide through these different levels and generally for the film itself.

Level One: This is an action film. On this level, if you're looking for action, fights, flights, gunfights, well, certainly this is a film you should watch. Would a Tarrantino film be a Tarrantino film without action?

Level Two: This is a Western. The movie is set during 1858 through 1859. The locales are the western states and Mississippi. The sets are convincing, the characters are believable. Tarrantino has created a brilliant script and story. Basically, the general population of the United States is depicted as ignorant, bigoted, racists, which this reviewer believes is not far off the mark.

Level Three: This is a historical film. By far the most controversial aspect of this film. There is generous use of the n-word, which to ears of 2013 is offensive, but for 1858 through 1859 was commonplace. Inconvenient truth. Tarrantinos depiction of the conditions for slavery are barbaric, brutal, and painful to witness. Slavery was, however, a barbaric and brutal system, and poisoned all who came into contact with it. Another inconvenient truth was the character depicted by Samuel Jackson who played the House Servant. There were also slaves who lived in the slave masters house and were essentially the slave masters personal servant and resident yes-man. The House Servant was reviled at the time by the slaves working in the fields, and modernly ridiculed by such figures as Malcolm X, and  rightfully so, as traitors. By far most of the controversy around the film have pertained to these elements, and the controversy has come from every quarter. This can only mean that the movie has touched a deep chord in our collective consciousness and the wounds from slavery and/or the Civil Rights Era have not been completely healed.

Level Four: This is a Road movie. Like Two-Lane Blacktop, like Easy Rider, like Vanishing Point, like any one of the many On-the-Road movies with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, this movie shows a journey with two protagonists, through the desolate and decrepit streets of insignificant western town, to the muggy, swampy, Mississippi plantations, and all of the adventures encountered along the way. This is by far the most unique aspect of the film. Tarrantino is the master of non-linear story-telling. This movie, however, is amazingly LINEAR, the simple telling of a story, from start to end, with a minimum of flashbacks.

Level Five: This is a mythological movie. Djangos quest is to locate and free his wife, named Brunnhilde, a slave raised learning to speak German. As Schultz explains the most famous German legend is that of Siegfried, a hero who killed a dragon and braved a ring of fire to free his Brunnhilde.

Level Six: This is a fantasy. Just as Inglorious Basterds climaxes with Hitler and his associates being blown up in a movie theater, Django Unchained ends with the plantation  and the House Servant  blown to bits. This reviewer is not aware, of course, of such an occurrence ever happening as historical fact  ...  but we can all dream.

If youve followed Tarrantinos career, he has matured as a movie maker with this film. The Tarrantino shtick found in previous films are present here, but underplayed. This reviewer believes Pulp Fiction is still his masterpiece, but this movie is a close second. But make no mistake, Django Unchained is at times a difficult film to watch. That difficulty arises in viewing the stark realities of the slave system in shocking detail. But as this review has attempted to show, this movie can be watched on any one of the many levels contained in the story. It certainly deserves five stars.",1361145600,5,3814,4.960815047021944
5261150,5,B00947NAHU,"Just from a anecdotal point of view, I saw RESERVIOR DOGS at The Chicago Film Festival in 1992, and ever since, I've been in love with the work of Quentin Tarantino. I can recall standing in line to see all of his early films (including TRUE ROMANCE and NATURAL BORN KILLERS, despite Tarantino's ire over Stone's changes to the film), but aside from JACKIE BROWN (which I still believe is easily Tarantino's weakest work), I have not been as instantly attracted to his films of late as of his earlier films. But then, I realized that this may be part of Tarantino's genius: To subvert his own fans' expectations of what his films should, would and could be. He had suddenly gone from Pop Noir Auteur to Grindhouse Reinventor, and like the films for the beginning of his career, he would also spawn a host of imitators with his work in the second part of his career. But as these charlatans would prove, nobody does Quentin Tarantino quite like Quentin Tarantino. And again, this holds true with his Western Revenge Epic/Love Story/History Revision DJANGO UNCHAINED, which is his newest masterpiece.

The film begins in Texas two years before the start of The Civil War. In the film's opening sequence, slave Django (Jamie Foxx) is being led by his newest ""owners"" until they happen upon traveling dentist Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz, who made his big splash in Tarantino's previous outing INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS) who is, in a way, looking for Django, without knowing it. It also so happens that Schultz is a bounty hunter, and Django can identify the three men Schultz is looking for. The two become partners and friends as Schultz sees Django's natural gunfighting skills, and after collecting many bounties, they begin an epic heroic quest to save Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from her bondage to Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a genuine Southern dandy plantation owner of ""Candie Land"". Unfortunately, Calvin's most trusted house slave (a decidedly aged Samuel L. Jackson) sees something beyond the roles Schultz and Django are playing in order to secure the freedom of Broomhilda, and this is where things really begin to enter into bloody revenge territory.

As always, Tarantino's dialogue and long monologues drip off the actors' tongues like the sweetest honey, even if much of the dialogue is peppered throughout with the unfortunate slang of the time period. While much of the generous use of the N-word is obviously more reflective of racial attitudes and the language of the time, but most importantly, it's never used merely for shock. But equally impressive is how assured Tarantino has become behind the camera. The long break between JACKIE BROWN and the KILL BILL films showed a director much more confident in his visual storytelling skills as well as his writing and he continues to improve with each subsequent film. Scenes like the dinner sequence at Candie Land and the following ""phrenology"" monologue give the same amount of tension and menace as the opening scene of BASTERDS. And the bravura third act is as energetic and tense and explosively violent as anything Tarantino has done.

Also, as Tarantino is usually excellent in doing, he assembles a top-notch cast packed with astounding performances. Jamie Foxx, an actor I more often see as an impediment to a film, does some terrific work here as the steely-eyed Django, letting his actions speak much louder than his words (although lines like ""I like the way you die, boy"" are handled with deftness and gravity). Washington seems sadly a little underused here, particularly from a filmmaker who has made the current portion of his career writing primarily about strong women, but in Tarantino's defense, this is much less about sexual politics than some of his more recent films, and more about racial ones and this being a ""man's world"" again speaks to the time. Jackson is incredible once again as Stephen, a man who sees beyond his master's greed and is fiercely intelligent and loyal, and seems to be the only man that Candie might consider something of a confidant. DiCaprio gives one of the great performances of his career here. He plays Candie as a genuine bon vivant; a man who lives with the assuredness of his superiority of everyone he lives with, and everyone exists merely for his entertainment. Being a wealthy white male in the South in this period gives him that, but DiCaprio plays that to the hilt, and is clearly greatly enjoying the opportunity to play a Tarantino villain. But yet again, it is Waltz, as he so clearly did in BASTERDS (and earning an incredibly well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for that film) who also walks away with this film. The character of King Schultz is so clearly defined from his opening which shows his vast intellect, his charm, his humor and his speed with a firearm, but also as a man who despises slavery despite being forced to work within its confines belies a deeper heart than is clearly displayed. It's a testament to a great actor who you can't take your eyes off or your ears away from when he's onscreen and is one of the great supporting performances of this year.

And again, we see a number of bit players to fill out this cast, such as Don Johnson, the great Walton Goggins, Tarantino regular Michael Parks, Russ and Amber Tamblyn, M.C. Gainey, Bruce Dern, Dennis Christopher, James Remar (playing two roles here), James Russo, Tom Wopat and of course Franco Nero, the Italian actor who played the original Django (bearing no resemblance to this film, but Tarantino clearly being a fan of his work). Tarantino's use of music in his soundtrack is, as always, brilliant. The film seems to be meandering at some points as it shows some of the beautiful vistas of the South, but this speaks clearly to the epic sensibilities of the film. The violence of the film, like in most of his films, is at first sudden and brutal, but then, as also with the KILL BILL films and BASTERDS, becomes more gleefully bloody and absurdly comical as the film reaches its crimson-drenched climax. Make no mistake: This is not a film for the faint of heart, but then, none of Tarantino's films are.

DJANGO UNCHAINED is yet another massively entertaining shot to the head from one of the great writer/directors of this generation.

A very well made and directed film, one of Tarrantino's best I'd venture to say, alongside Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds.  He is very keen on dialogue, and there's some great dialogue in this film, plus his love for spaghetti westerns definitely shows in this film.  I will likely buy this on day one!  To any of you Tarrantino fans out there or that like a really well made film and don't mind gore and racial stuff & a bit of brutality, then I highly recommend this film.

Besides, the main character, Django, is neither compelling nor sympathetic. He is too violent to be a hero; a slave by heart and a villain by deeds, he has no moral principles and kills defenceless women and unarmed people. Compare Django to Clint Eastwood's character from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Who would you prefer to meet in a dark alley?

Tarantino proves one more time that he is a master of great short novels, but he is unable to create an all-of-a-piece feature film. If The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is the 5 star standard of spaghetti-westerns, Django Unchained deserves only 3.",1360713600,5,712,4.51937984496124
5261154,5,B00947NAHU,"Tarantino's latest film takes us further into his ""white guilt revenge"" trend, with Django Unchained. To Tarantino's credit, instead of making a heavy handed repeat lesson of ""slavery bad, tolerance good"", it's simply a gratuitous revenge flick where Django will kill any whitey that's in his way between him and his woman, and there's a lot to this film that makes it great. Hell I'd say Django Unchained & Cabin in the Woods were easily the most entertaining movies of 2012, and considering Django's almost 3 hour running time, that's impressive.

So it starts out where King Schultz, a bounty hunter, finds and frees Django since he holds vital information for the next target, and after Django's freed King decides to hire Django as a partner. King was played well by Christopher Waltz, who leads the show for the first half of Django Unchained. They take out a few bounties, and Django slowly grows accustomed to freedom and ""killin white folk for money"". The whole first half feels a lot like a spaghetti western, where they travel from town to town chasing bounties, and their friendship is shown well as Jamie Foxx & Christopher Waltz play off each other well.

After King is satisfied with catching a good amount of bounties with Django, he helps his assistant find his estranged wife, whom is located at Calvin Candie's plantation. They meet up with Candie during a mandingo fight, and tell him a story they weaved where they're both mandingo fans and want to purchase one of his for a large sum of money. So because of the ridiculous amount of money offered, Candie takes them to his plantation, where you see a lot of interesting things develop. First off, King becomes more and more cold footed about how Candie mistreats his slaves, he swallows the mandingo's killing each other, but it's like he realizes he's going into the heart of darkness and is struggling to contain his revulsion. In turn, this is where you see Django start to lead the show, as he's accustomed to the cruelty, he knows how to handle himself. And because he plays his character of an Uncle Tom so well, Candie is literally amazed and lets Django go on pushing the Candie employees and slaves around. There's a lot of character development in their short ride to Candieland.

finally when they arrive, Django meets a rival Uncle Tom, Stephen, who is played by the hilarious Samuel L. Jackson, who instantly attempts to put Django in his place in front of the other slaves to establish his dominance. Stephen is fascinating because he seems like the real power behind Candieland, as Samuel L. Jackson himself put it: the Dick Cheney of Candieland. We see him running it when Candie's gone, telling Candie the what's-what behind their mystery guests, and is generally keeping everyone in line whilst Calvin enjoys the easy life of being 'Massa'. Just the way Stephie leans on Calvin's chair at dinner and nods his head to everything Calvin says is hilariously symbolic of their relationship.

And speaking of their relationship, they totally parallel off of King and Django's relationship as basically black and white partners of the era. King and Candie are the overtly friendly white guys, trading nothing but smiles between each other and talking pleasantries, while Django and Stephen are quietly assessing their situation and coldly sizing each other up as black rivals.

Eventually things go south for King & Django in Candieland, and the irony of it all is because of King's nature to dive into situations under a ruse. Candie would've probably sold Hilda for cheap to King, and it would make sense since he would want a German speaking slave. But since King decided to set up an elaborate ruse, things go bad, and Django has to shoot his way out of Candieland in one of the most over-the-top bloodbaths I've seen since Kill Bill Vol. 1. Similar to Cabin in the Woods ""let's get this party started"" scene, my face lit up with glee and was completely mesmerized by the carnage on screen.

So nearing the end of the film the story starts to drag out a little with the Australians escorting the slaves to the Winn Dickey Mining company, which is apparently worse than death according to Stephen. Even though the story's noticeably starting to sag everything is so well done that it's really hard to fault, and some of the film's best moments happen in the last 20 minutes, so really it's more of an observation than a complaint.

So this movie was really f***ing entertaining the whole way through, the music choices were superb, the acting was well done, and the film hit all the right marks regarding tone. When it was comedic people were laughing, when it was suspenseful people were quiet, etc. The cinematography was also gorgeous, one scene that sticks out the most for me is near the end when the villains are walking together in the dark, Tarantino undoubtedly knows his s*** when it comes to making a fun movie, and I appreciate that it simply wants to entertain rather than tell you a message.

Oh speaking of that let's talk about the racism, lets just say Tarantino doesn't pull any punches, but as he's argued it's all accurate of the time (well maybe except mandingo fighting). The slaves don't look like polished supermodels, the N word is used liberally, and ultimately the film just turns slavery on it's head and shows you one slave taking revenge to save his wife. Another thing to note is the violence, when it's against blacks its very realistic and sober, but when it's against the whites it's really over the top and hilarious.

I admit I felt burned out of Tarantino when I went into this, since I think he hasn't made a really great film since Jackie Brown (although Inglorious Bastards had some really high points), but this I would say is one of his better films, and definitely stands out against all of the Tarantino-imitation directors out there.",1360627200,2,5865,4.764763779527559

5261156,3,B00947NAHU,"Tarantino probably had run into some sort of dilemma while writing the script of this film.
He could have written a reboot of Spaghetti Western e.g. ""My Name is Nobody"".
Or a Post-Noir Western e.g. ""Duel in the Sun"" or ""Johnny Guitar"".
Audacious as always, he threw in the untouchable subject matter of American slavery which
became the major ingredient that changed the flavor of this film.

The result is an overlong, brilliant, daring, funny in parts, catsup-flying violence and mundane
in others which resulted a not-very-satisfying Tarantino film.

Due to the aforementioned slavery subject, the title character Django played by Jamie Foxx
had to remain as a solemn slave turned unlikely super gunslinger instead of an over-the-top Tarantino
character we grew to expect or love.  This in turn robbed the viewers of a strong protagonist to
root for.

Instead  the standouts are Leonardo DiCaprio, Christopher Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson.
Christopher Waltz lifted the first part of the film with his engaging acting and the Tarantino dialogue.
The strongest part belonged to DiCaprio's southern plantation sequence with Leo giving his meanest
and strongest performance to date.
Samuel Jackson also gave a strong and funny 'uncle tom' performance.
Some of the sequences were overlong/overdone e.g. the clan raid and other many forgettable sequences should
have been trimmed.

The film lasted about 2hr 30 mins which would be better ended at the standoff after the mayhem
at the plantation mansion.
Being Tarantino, he didn't want the film to end(it's too early!).
He added on the last stretch with his own bloated cameo which broke the momentum of the film and
followed by the hero/heroine 'riding off into sunset' after the final (yawn) major destruction.

This film had received some negative responses from the African American circles including Spike Lee
after its release.
This is understandable since it is a painful subject and uncomfortable to watch.
However, Tarantino should be applauded for putting the unsavory chapter in the American history on the
big screen for the current and future generations to come.",1360540800,6,2122,5.223529411764706

Good...sounds like a nice night.  Oh, but don't forget...

Rampant brutality?  Check.  Murder and mayhem?  Check.  Buckets of blood?  Check.  Strings of nasty racial epithets?  Check.

Yes, like it or not, they're both Tarantino.  I like him; in fact, ever since I first saw RESERVOIR DOGS--when I had realized this was a real Hollywood star in the making--I have caught every movie he's directed or written.  It's just that I'm beginning to see the pattern, and I'm wondering if he's gotten caught up in himself.

And so, what about ""Django""?  Well, I particularly enjoyed the first half, where the pacing and plot really sizzled.  But it was during the second half when I began wondering if he isn't getting a bit predictable, substituting blood and offal for substance.  Of late, in fact, it's been one of the main concerns I have with Tarantino's ""direction""--and I mean that in both senses.

Perhaps ""predictable,"" alone, is the wrong word, but...to invent an oxymoron for this director...I think Tarantino's becoming guilty of ""predictable shock.""

As an example I bring up the ""n-word,"" which is a word I can't even spell out in this review, but it is used as freely in this movie as oxygen.  And yes, I know the whole notion of slavery is repulsive and the director wants to shock us, but one begins to wonder why Tarantino revels in this aspect SO much.  It's OVERDONE...much like the use of swear words by a precocious teenager when out of sight of the parents.

And it's not just racial epithets...it's anything he can do to stun the audience.

I don't want to come off as a grumpy old man, but I'm wondering what Tarantino is wasting his considerable talent this way.  There are so many great scenes that he creates when he tries.

In ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Christoph Weitz's interrogation of the Frenchman in his house absolutely terrifies the viewer though its subtle undertone of menace; in ""Kill Bill II"" David Carradine's monologue about Superman's lack of a mask is wonderful not only because of its intelligence, but also in how it allows him to parade his superior position over the protagonist.

And who can forget Samuel Jackson's and John Travolta's offbeat conversation about French Burger Kings--as well as the grand history of the Bruce Willis' wristwatch--in ""Pulp Fiction,"" and the magnificent opening scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"" between mobsters arguing with each other about what Madonna meant by her expression ""Like a Virgin""?

And all of these great scenes--and others--are done without violence.

Tarantino can MAKE stars as well as re-awaken fading actors careers.  He has developed a genre of playful innovation, like the use of anime in ""Kill Bill"" to tell the horrible story of one assassin's upbringing;  the use of editing to skip the ENTIRE robbery that is at the very HEART of ""Reservoir Dogs""; the anachronistic style of telling stories that skip here and there in time (used so well in ""Pulp Fiction"" and the two ""Kill Bills,"" particularly).

The thing that bothers me about ""Django"" is the joy in the vile, especially in a time where guns are such a prevalent force in America.  It's constant: it's in the use of language, it's in the hateful killing.  And, more than ever now, he's reveling in the ecstasy of violence, gouts of blood, and wholesale slaughter.

As Tarantino is rumored to be directing ""Kill Bill 3,"" not much is going to change---not very soon, at least.  I do love this man's talent, but I feel has not yet displayed the maturity that defines a great director; an ability to do more than just continue one particular kind of film.

I look forward to the day he is more than this generation's Sam Peckinpah.  I hope I get to see what he is capable of BEYOND the merely titillating, and defines himself not as a giggly boy, but as a man.",1360281600,7,6086,6.063157894736842
5261158,4,B00947NAHU,"""My name is Django. The D is silent.""

King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) slowly rides his dentist's wagon toward two slave traders and their recent purchases, a line of black men all bound together with shackles, bare-chested in the cold Texas night. The outwardly affable Schultz is looking for a particular slave purchased at a specific plantation. The two slave traders aren't very receptive to their visitor, but Schultz is convinced the slave is in their possession. After some `negotiation', Schultz soon meets Django (Jamie Foxx). Schultz is a bounty hunter desperate to find the Brittle brothers, three sadistic plantation workers with a price on their head. Schultz doesn't know what they look like and Django does. They make an agreement; if Django helps Schultz, the bounty hunter will help his new friend find his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who has been purchased by another ruthless plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). But there are many obstacles, including an old slave (Samuel L. Jackson) who is very devoted to Candie.

So begins ""Django Unchained"", the new film from writer/director Quentin Tarantino. And from the moment the film begins, there is no mistaking this film as anything but a Tarantino film. Over the top dialogue and violence, amusing character interactions, a mish-mash of filmmaking genres and actors at the top of their game are all in evidence in the masterful director's newest film.

Tarantino's well-publicized beginnings - working at a video store and devouring every film there - have inspired and/or shaped every film he has made. Some of these films include Blaxploitation titles about slaves who fight back against their oppressive masters and these provide the inspiration for ""Django"".

Some of these films were made by filmmakers with small budgets and less talent. Others were made on the cheap to capitalize on a specific audience. Some of these films are remembered today because of the actors involved. Some; because of the outrageous, over-the-top action. But most of these are, let's face it, terrible films.

The beauty of Tarantino's films is that he takes inspiration from these bad films and filters it through his far superior filmmaking skills and larger budgets. He's giving Five Star treatment to B or C grade material. When he does this, he elevates it while still retaining the feel and style of the originals, creating films that are unique and extremely watchable.

From the moment the film begins, you recognize all of the familiar hallmarks of Tarantino's style. Schultz often uses verbal dexterity to momentarily confuse the people he is dealing with, giving him the upper hand. Tarantino is a skilled writer and his dialogue is usually great, revealing unique and interesting things about his characters. If anything, the writer occasionally suffers from a lack of editing and his dialogue goes on for too long and for no other reason than to show how great his writing is. On the flip side, he also frequently features characters who are largely silent, but still manage to get their ideas across. Uma Thurman's The Bride is a great example of this. Hell-bent on revenge, she has heard everything before making her much more interested in results. Django is very similar. Extremely quiet and introspective, he spends a lot of time standing by, watching, as Schultz talks his way into and out of various situations. Most of the characters in ""Django"" can be traced back through Tarantino's other films. And even though we have seen the ancestors of these characters before, the director does a great job of making these characters exciting and memorable.

One of the hallmarks of Tarantino's previous works is less evident here. In the past, Tarantino has cast some of the actors who made his inspirational films so memorable as the leads in his films, giving them a significant showcase to reinvigorate their careers. John Travolta, Pam Grier, Robert Forster, David Carradine, to name a few, got jumpstarts from their appearances in Tarantino's works. Lately, as the budgets of his films continue to increase, and his films become more important to the production company, he has been leaning more heavily on A-List talent. Look at ""Jackie Brown"" -  Pam Grier and Robert Forster are the stars; Robert DeNiro, Bridget Fonda and Samuel L. Jackson are the co-stars. In ""Django"", the balance has shifted. Some interesting actors pop-up in small roles - Don Johnson, Russ Tamblyn, and M.C. Gainey - but these moments don't have the impact of someone like Grier starring in a film. The thrill of rediscovering a good actor is one aspect of what makes some of Tarantino's films so great.

Jamie Foxx is very good. From the moment he introduces himself - ""The D is silent"" - you get what he and Tarantino are trying to do. Foxx is playing The Black Man with No Name, based on a character made famous by Clint Eastwood in his early westerns. This is a grittier, bloodier, Tarantino-ized version of the character, but the inspiration is clear. Even when Django is standing still, observing, a subtle facial expression or change in body language helps build his character and illustrate the feelings he has difficulty expressing.

Christoph Waltz is very good as King Schultz, the bounty hunter who decides traveling with a black man, in the South, before the Civil War, is the best and easiest way to track his prey. Perhaps the best thing about his character is that he doesn't seem to care what others think. If they voice an objection, he spins a tale to convince them otherwise or spins a tale to distract them until he can physically persuade them. Schultz can't physically overpower his adversaries, and they frequently beat him to the draw, but once he starts speaking, he uses words to beat them. You get the sense Tarantino had a lot of fun writing and creating this character.

Tarantino is a very good writer and each of his films is filled with great dialogue. If anything, they sometimes have too much dialogue and we spend too much time sitting, watching: a single conversation between characters that really does nothing but show how clever the writer is. In Schultz, Tarantino is able to show off his skill, but uses his talents to create an interesting, memorable character.

They soon learn Django's wife, Broomhilda, was purchased by Candie (DiCaprio), a plantation owner who likes to pit his male slaves against one another in Mandingo-style fighting. Mandingo fighting is something that was featured in some of those films Tarantino loved to watch and this is his opportunity to combine two of his very different influences. There is no evidence this type of thing happened in this era, but it is the crazy type of genre-busting Tarantino did so well.

DiCaprio clearly relishes playing a villain and he does it well. Candie is quiet and subtle, but no less menacing because of it. When he describes how he treats someone, or expects someone to act, it is clear that despite his tone, if his instructions aren't followed, people will die. And we quickly learn he has an entire squadron of hired guns ready and willing to fight and die for their boss.

Samuel L. Jackson plays Stephen, Calvin's long-time, trusted slave who doles out punishment to the other slaves, gives orders to Candie's hired guns and basically oversees all of the plantation operations.

When the group arrives at the plantation, the learn Broomhilda has been put in the Hot Box, at Stephen's directions, to teach her some manners. Django stays cool, barely, but stares at Stephen with confusion, unable to comprehend how one black person could willingly put another black person in this situation. Throughout, Stephen shows allegiance to no one but Calvin and his sister, afraid to upset the order.

Waltz and DiCaprio are earning a lot of praise for their performances, but Jackson deserves as much praise. His performance is mesmerizing because you find yourself asking how this slave ended up in this place, ready and willing to dole out punishment and because Stephen is frequently put in his place by Candie, when he has overstepped his bounds or his owner disagrees. Candice seems to treat the older slave as a child, giving him a proverbial slap on the hand. And Stephen quickly laughs these moments off all too aware that if Candie's mood were to change, he could end up in a Mandingo fight against someone twenty years younger and one hundred pounds heavier.

The most interesting thing about Broomhilda, Kerry Washington's character, is that she grew up with German plantation owners, receiving a German name and learning their language. She uses this knowledge throughout, giving her a way to communicate in secret.

Many notable people take on small roles, adding flavor to the film, giving the viewer small surprises throughout. Some of them are so brief you might not catch them.

""Django"" is an accomplished film made by a filmmaker working at the height of his talents. But Tarantino has a tendency to go on too long. In ""Django"", part of the ending seems superfluous and gives the end a bit of an anti-climactic feeling. It almost becomes ""too much"", shifting the balance to the wrong side. Almost.

Catch ""Django"" and revel in the delights only a filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino can unleash upon you.",1360281600,4,9296,4.969755469755469
5261159,5,B00947NAHU,"This is an admirable adventure film and it probably reflect a deep change in American culture concerning the Blacks, African Americans. So far the great authors and playwrights dealing with the Blacks only or practically only showed the villainous hardships of slavery. This film surely shows a lot of that, but with a different eye than in Toni Morrison's Beloved or many other novels. It shows slavery as the most cruel and absurd social system ever invented but once again from a new point of view, that of a black man who gets out of slavery by accident and gets in business with a German immigrant and shares with him the profession of bounty hunter. That means he can ride a horse and kill white people, provided it is under the authority of his white associate and under the sanctimonious authority of a court-ordered mission, that of catching some fugitive criminals dead or alive.

This black man has a vengeance to fulfill since his wife has been sold away to another planter, one of the worst in Mississippi. I will not deflower the film and tell you the details. This black man, Django, wants to find his wife and free her and in the end, of course, he will succeed, but what an adventure.

The new element in this film is that beyond slavery, and we are just before the Civil War, some Blacks are recapturing their desire to be free beyond their fate of obedience. That fate is explained by the planter as being the result of some kind of a ""malformation"" of the skull. It is of course the result of nothing but the Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSS) they have been through in the daily suffering imposed onto them mostly for the pure and simple pleasure of the white planters and their white associates who are all shown over and over again as nothing but sadist dullards.

We are here in a postcolonial approach that is only possible because the Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, also called Post Traumatic Slavery Syndrome is finding some kind of a solution, some healing procedure, some way of stepping over it and moving on. This has been a slow and long procedure and the Civil Rights movement, Martin Luther King, and now Barack Obama, and many others before and in-between, have been instrumental in that evolution. Blacks or African Americans are finally finding their self-respect, their self-freedom, their self-pride back and they can finally decolonialize their own souls, their own minds, as the CNN wrote so rightly on November 22, 2012. And when one's mind is free of any colonial heritage the sky is the limit and the White House is the first step to that sky.

Of course the film is unrealistic, the weapons are as effective as missile throwers if not even rockets launched by some drone from the sky. Of course there is too much blood. But it is the first time some of the cruelty of these slave-owners is finally shown, alluded to and defused into absolute punishment. To be free in your soul you must be convinced your torturers have been punished, even those who were silent if not consenting witnesses. That means you have to finally remember and reconcile with and recommit yourself to the future and no longer remain enslaved to the past. That means forgiving the descendants of your torturers and that means the descendants of your torturers have to finally step over their belief you are inferior, which makes them superior without having to prove it.

That's why this film is great. It is really the beginning of the end, maybe even the beginning of the day after the end.

5261160,5,B00947NAHU,"One thing you have to say about Quentin Tarantin is, his movies have a freshness and spunk that no other filmmaker today possesses.  I can only imagine this is due to the countless old A, B, C and D grade movies this guy has been watching his entire lifetime.

In Django Unchained, you can feel Tarantino's love for classic movies and style pouring out of every scene.  It is like he's taken all the movies he has loved from the exploitation, western, and B grade genres from decades gone by, thrown them all up in the air together, and out of this mix has come a movie that feels as fresh as a drop of dew, and fascinating from start to finish.

I suppose the first thing that came to mind when watching Django Unchained, is how truly amazing a filmmaker Quentin Tarantino must be if only for one fact (among others) - he has made an almost 3 hour long movie, that to me felt like a 90 minute Friday-night popcorn movie.  How can a filmmaker achieve this?  I can only think of a handful of movies in history, that are upwards of 3+ hours long that completely absorbed me from the first minute, and I could count those films on one hand (think movies of the stature of The Godfather for example.)  An enormously difficult feat to achieve, yet in Django Unchained, Tarantino strings together one fascinating set-piece scene after the other, totally absorbing the viewer in his 'world', for almost 3 hours.  I never looked at my watch or took my eyes away from the screen for a second during this movie.  This fact alone, evidences a filmmaker at the absolute peak of his craft.  I can't think of many (if any) other filmmakers out there today that could achieve such a difficult feat with the effortlessness that Tarantino displays in Django Unchained.

I won't bore the reader with the description of the plot - there is plenty of info/press out there.  Needless to say, not residing in the USA, I don't have any personal feelings or bias on the subject of slavery that I'm sure many other writers here from the USA (and other countries) do.  Accordingly, I was able to simply look at this movie on its merits, without personally being impacted by the potentially offensive or political ramifications of the message Tarantino is attempting to convey here - positive, and negative.  What I will say is that the film has a quality that makes me 'feel' like I was part of this time in history - I was living the experience with the cast on the screen, as the hours flew by.  Jamie Foxx was excellent as the star of the film, but of course he doesn't have as much 'meat' in his role as the other two major players.  It is Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Waltz that steal the show here.  They are both such powerful actors and I was truly absorbed by their depictions of two men with opposing ideals on the subject of slavery.

I think Tarantino's films have been (mostly) hits and only minor misses in his career.  I'd personally put Django Unchained in my top 3 or 4 Tarantino films, behind only Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, and perhaps the first volume of Kill Bill, which I also found exceptionally clever, entertaining and 'fresh' - such a different movie-going experience from the millions of other mass-produced movies brought out of Hollywood every other day.

Nothing more I can say.  It is a 3 hour long movie that simply sails by !  As noted above I couldn't believe by the end of it I'd been sitting in the theatre for over 3 hours (including the previews).  A fascinating film from start to finish.  I have a feeling it won't win the Best Picture gong this year but, I've seen many of the other nominees and, Django Unchained deserves to go 'close' in my opinion.  I just don't think Academy Voters vote for a movie like this.  A film tackling without restraint, the subject of slavery with violence smattered all through it?  Not a chance.  A shame though.  It'd be great if a movie like this that takes such risks and walks the tightrope was duly rewarded for it.  Irrespective of this, 'Django' is a great way to spend an evening at the movies.

5261165,3,B00947NAHU,"I am not sure why so many people are reaving about this film as if it is the masterpiece to end of masterpieces.  It is a fair film (lower end of the spectrum) at best.  It is a cross between a spaghetti-western and a 70s exploitation film.  Okay, lets start with the bad and work our way to the good.  Tarantino's trademark is trying for ""shock value"" in films and, the truth is, this style is way past its prime.  Sure it worked in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but how about trying something new?  This film could have had WAY more impact had he not required the actors to drop the N-bomb so many times.  Sure, it is relevant to the time period, but WE GET IT! How about moving on with the story and stop bashing us over the head with it?  Next, the plot and story line was so predictable that it was sad.  Did anyone see anything stellar or new here?  There is better story-telling on prime time TV than in this movie (admitting that made me just a little sick to my stomach).  As a matter of fact, the theme and plot of the story is the same as for every 80s video game: We are off to save the princess!  Really?  This is the best Tarantino can come up with?  Hell, even Mario Bros did it better (I'm sorry Mario, but the princess is in another castle).  Next, all the raving about the ""massive violence"" is misplaced.  Where was this violence? Again, you can see more graphic stuff on NETWORK TV.  If you are going to push the envelope, then push the envelope! CSI is worse/grittier than this film (as far as violence goes). Lastly, (at least for this review) making fun of the KKK (who certainly deserve to be made fun of) has already been done FAR better in the film Oh Brother, Where Art Thou.  This was a total rip-off of that scene.  Again, how about having an original idea, Tarantino?

Okay, now on to the good.  Jamie Foxx was BRILLIANT in this film.  His acting was a masterpiece to witness and will keep the viewer riveted (and luckily overlooking the rampant flaws with the rest of the film).  Sam Jackson...well, what can I say?  Another brilliant actor.  Need I say more?  The portrayal of Dr Shultz was a fine piece of work in this mishmash of a film.  Overall, it is easy to see how the individual actors saved a substandard film and apparently did such a good job that many other reviewers are overlooking the overall failure of this film.  The absolute best part of this film is the development of the relationship between Shultz and Django.  This is the real story of the film.  This is the ONLY story worth remembering from this film.  By the time the film came to an end, I felt my time was wasted with so much superfluous nonsense.  Funny, that is just how DiCaprio's character felt (but I am not going to spoil this film for those who have not seen it yet).  Is this film Tarantino's worst?  No.  Is it his best?  No.  Is it a middle of the road western that has already been done by far better directors?  I am afraid so.",1359331200,11,2953,4.282608695652174

5261168,4,B00947NAHU,"""Django Unchained"" is Quentin Tarantino's homage to the spaghetti Westerns he grew up with.  It is a classic revenge tale packaged for modern Western political sensibilities:  A runaway slave partners with a German bounty hunter to rescue the slave's wife from the clutches of an evil plantation owner who is despicably violent and worse has really bad teeth.  It's a film that ought to be satisfying to watch, and indeed it is.  And it ought to be a film in which violence feels good, and it does but not without leaving a sour taste in the viewer's mouth (in light of all the recent mass shootings in America).

I think the film does not implode into senseless violence mainly because of the romanticism and chivalry of the German bounty hunter, played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz, who played the villain bone-chillingly brilliantly in Tarantino's ""Inglorious Basterds.""  Waltz, who has made a small fortune for himself shooting down violent despicable men in the most violently despicable manner (he kills a sheriff in front of the townspeople who elected him, and he guns down a farmer in front of the farmer's son) decides to help Django rescue his wife Bromhilda because the name conjures up for him the legend of Siegfried, and he's determined to help this black Siegfried rescued his beloved from the hell in which she's imprisoned.  That's why when he ultimately dies defending his romantic and chivalrous notions of justice and honor it feels gratuitous and unworthy.

There's something raw and exciting about Tarantino's film-making, but perhaps his film-making is too raw and exciting.  He perhaps lacks the intellectual capacity, rigour, and discipline to turn his films into something more refined and everlasting.  That's certainly the problem with his latest creation.",1359072000,,1787,5.109965635738831
5261169,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino has said publicly that he wants to retire after his tenth film. He is looking to leave behind a strong filmography that shows no weakness or slump at the end. His eighth entry (counting the Kill Bill volumes separately) into this abstract Decalogue is Django Unchained, and it may be his greatest achievement since Pulp Fiction.

Django Unchained is the finest American slavery period bounty hunter Western ever made, but clearly that doesn't mean much. As preposterous as that description is, that's what is so great about a Tarantino film; he digs deep into a traditional genre and develops it into something distinctive. The same can be said about his Holocaust revisionist historical war film, Inglorious Basterds. The title character, Django (Jamie Foxx), is a slave with a horrific past who through a chain of auspicious events becomes partnered with a slavery opposed ex-dentist and current bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). This partnership is sealed with an agreement that Schultz will help Django find and free his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from an infamous Southern plantation.

Django Unchained is void of any superfluous substance. From the opening scene of dialogue where Django and Schultz are introduced all the way to the final ""showdown,"" Django Unchained has momentum and remains in stride. Tarantino should win his second Original Screenplay Oscar since no other film that can be nominated for this category combines such compelling dialogue with such a spirited and ambitions story. The film unfolds in a series of distinct acts. Furthermore, Tarantino takes his flair for the irregular timeline to a more subtle place by interjecting small contextual flashbacks at key points to reveal critical or entertaining pieces of background that enhance an approaching scene. You may never look at the Ku Klux Klan, or Don Johnson for that matter, the same way again.

The cast is impeccable and is sprinkled with familiar faces beyond the leads, but the leads are all excellent. Christoph Waltz gives Tarantino another Oscar worthy performance as the film's moral compass, Dr. Schultz. Schultz's character also works to deepen and broaden Foxx's turn as Django. Django has a goal, but lacks direction and Schultz literally provides that for him, which gives Foxx some real dimension and power. However, the film's crown jewel is found in the film's closing acts when Leonardo DiCaprio appears as Calvin Candie, owner of the massive and legendary plantation known as Candyland. DiCaprio's performance is a sneaky one, and while initially campy, it becomes very real all too quickly. His character shows a severe authenticity as a symbol for the evils of supposed ""gentlemen"" during a deeply deranged time in American history. As fun as Django Unchained is to watch, it is still a Quentin Tarantino movie, which implies vulgarity and violence. It delivers on both of those qualities to excess, which is a good thing in this case. As part of the Western genre, a lot of justice is sought out against a lot of bad people, and a six-shooter is basically the only tool. The balance between good acting, strong writing, unpredictable circumstances, and sudden bursts of violence creates a suspenseful tone that could not otherwise be achieved. Django Unchained is a front-runner for one of the year's best films as well as a front-runner for one of Tarantino's best films. If this is any indication of what the nearly 50-year-old director has left in him, it is hard to imagine him walking away after stepping behind a camera only two more times. A

5261170,5,B00947NAHU,"Quentin Tarantino's long, whimsical, stylish and stylistically multi-genre spaghetti western, comedy and southern plantation slavery drama  is, of course, also a tribute to the original Django (1966 with Franco Nero) as well as Eastwood's High Plains Drifter (the ride into town, with locals stopping in their tracks gawking, beautiful woman peering from a window, the Fistful of Dollars-type background score, etc.) Oh yes: Shaft is in there somewhere too.

5261171,5,B00947NAHU,"Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Django Unchained"" is a mixture of history, moralizing, violence, and parody. The movie is lengthy, at nearly three hours, but moves quickly. The acting,scenery, costuming, and musical score each add a great deal to the film.

The movie is set in Texas, Mississippi, and the west in 1858, two years before the Civil War. The overarching theme of the movie, the evil of slavery, is brought home from the opening scenes, in which two slave traders lead a coffle of bound slaves through the woods to be sold. The primary character Django Freeman (Jimmie Foxx) is a slave in the coffle rescued by a flamboyant German bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), because of his ability to recognize a group of former overseers who are wanted by the law dead or alive. Django and Schultz become companions.  Django quickly becomes highly skilled with firearms.  He agrees to help Schultz with bounty hunting in exchange for Schultz'assistance in finding and freeing his wife, Broomhilda, (Kerry Washington).

There are many humorous, violent, and colorful scenes before the pair arrive in Meridian, Missippi to learn that Broomhilda is at a large plantation called Candieland owned by Calvin Candie (Leonard DiCaprio), the mercurial arch-villian of the film. Candie is a patron of a vicious gladiatorial-like combat called mandingo in which slaves wrestle to the death. (There is no historical evidence that mandingo fighting took place in the Old South.) Schultz and Django develop an elaborate scheme to find and free Broomhilda under the ruse that Django is a free black slaveholder (there were some in the South) who seeks to buy a slave for mandingo fighting and to pay top dollar.

As the story develops, Tarantino shows a great deal about the brutality of plantation life at Candieland, with characters including the Uncle-Tom slave Stephen (Samuel Jackson) and Candie's widowed sister Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwillie (Laura Cayouette) who displays a great degree of smoldering sexual frustration.  The tension builds gradually through the extended plantation scenes until the film explodes in a large cascade of violence and death and destruction, with the triumph of Django over the slaveholder tormentors.

The movie is an eclectic melange of history and echoes of B-grade westerns. Each component of this film, from the depiction of slavery to the language, violence, and use of earlier films, can and has been subjected to extended discussion and reflection. I found that the movie worked well.  ""Django Unchained"" held my attention throughout and made me think about what I had seen long after it ended. Tarantino has imaginatively blended his sources together to create a riveting, entertaining movie with superb performances by Waltz, DiCaprio, and Jackson. I lost an initial skepticism about this movie.  The more I thought about it, the better I liked it.

5261172,5,B00947NAHU,"Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave, procured by bounty hunter Dr King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) in 1858 Texas to help him track down three criminal brothers with a substantial reward on their heads, dead or alive. In the course of this bounty hunting work Schultz and Django become friends and so Schultz proposes that he help Django rescue his wife (Kerry Washington) who has been sold to the vile Calvin Candy (Leonardo DiCaprio). This brings them into the heart of Mississippi slave country and the ever more repulsive realities of slavery.

Quentin Tarantino has sometimes been accused of making gratuitously violent movies. Here, given the realities of US slavery, he could be accused of being overly restrained. It is a nice touch that the most sympathetic and moral white character in the movie, King Schultz, is a bounty hunter who kills for a living: compared to the supposedly refined ""plantocracy"" of the South, Schultz is a paragon of human decency revolted by the crass pretensions and horrific brutality of the slavers.

As is Tarantino's won't the film is interspersed with a series of spectacular, and spectacularly bloody, shoot outs filmed in stunning locations. Between the killings there is heaps of literate and often very funny dialogue delivered through note-perfect performances by Foxx, Washington, DiCaprio, Waltz and, most particularly, Samuel L Jackson as the terrifying and malevolent Stephen, the chief ""houseboy"" of DiCaprio's Candyland.

Foxx's Django describes himself at one point in the movie as ""1 in 10,000"" prepared to fight for his freedom and that of those his loves. However it would be more precise to say he was ""1 in 20"": Django is a fictional precursor of the 200,000 black troops who fought against the Confederacy and thereby ensured that slavery abolition became the central purpose of the American Civil War and with that four million slaves obtain freedom.

Still Django Unchained is an extraordinary and exhilarating work of cinema. Time will tell but it may well prove to be a classic.",1358899200,4,2033,5.096096096096096
5261173,5,B00947NAHU,"To the surprise of no one, Django Unchained is an essentially Tarantino love letter to a genre that's been left sadly underutilized over recent decades. It's every bit a straightforward action / revenge picture, with debts owed to the dozens of Leone & company spaghetti westerns that populated theaters in the sixties and seventies. The central plot is thread-bare - several of Pulp Fiction's competing storylines have quite a bit more depth - but surprisingly never really feels like it lingers or oversteps its bounds, even as the runtime approaches three hours. Eyes-forward escapism is the message of the day, and Django scratches that itch with vigor. It's a tale that, despite an egregious body count and a comical amount of gory debauchery, doesn't take itself too seriously and is inexplicably able to draw hearty laughs from moments that would have been downright chilling in another director's hands. The key role players are almost unanimously entertaining; DiCaprio as the smarmy, loathsome plantation owner, Jackson as his savvy right-hand man, Foxx as the blunt instrument of justice... they all play one note, but it's flawlessly tuned. The real show-stealer, once again, is Christoph Waltz, whose grinning, man-of-the-world bounty hunter fuels the majority of the fire. Although his role is a polar opposite to the slimy Nazi turncoat he portrayed in Inglourious Basterds, it's no less memorable and the picture sags noticeably when he isn't on the screen. Tarantino has turned in smarter efforts, carved deeper characters and written sharper dialog, but he's rarely been this indulgently entertaining. I loved the experience, especially in a theaterful of similarly-humored moviegoers, and can't wait to ingest the subtleties on my own when it's released for home viewing.",1358726400,9,1790,5.328621908127208

5261176,5,B00947NAHU,"After becoming Martin Scorsese's mole and making great American classics with Scorsese (2004's The Aviator, 2006's The Departed, and, as some people agree, 2002's Gangs of New York and 2010's Shutter Island), Leonardo DiCaprio has gone on to work with another Hollywood great, the man inspired by DiCaprio's mole in Scorsese: Quinton Tarantino.

The outcome is Django Unchained, which unites DiCaprio and Tarantino in a much-awaited collaboration, along with a powerful ensemble cast supporting both DiCaprio and Tarantino: Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz (making his sophomore collaboration with Tarantino three years after Inglorious Basterds), Samuel L. Jackson (marking Jackson's fourth collaboration with Tarantino, following Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and Kill Bill: Volume 2), Kerry Washington, Don Johnson, and, for a cameo appearance, Franco Nero (for those of you unfamiliar with Nero, Nero is the man who played the head villain in both Die Hard 2 and Force Ten From Navarone). The story stars Foxx as Django, a slave in Texas who, many years ago, was sold apart from his wife, Broomhilda (Washington). Broomhilda has gone on to a Southern plantation in Mississippi, owned and controlled by an infamous and cruel slave owner named Calvin J. Candie (DiCaprio). The minute that Django is rescued by a German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Waltz), he seizes control of the opportunity to rescue Broomhilda. Before reaching that point, however, Django and Dr. Schultz are going to go through Hell and back. And they may (knowingly) never escape up against the cruel and manipulative, yet brilliantly smart tactics used against them by Calvin J. Candie and his fellow slave owners.

For the two and a half hours given to us by Tarantino, we find ourselves on a wild trip back through time. For having shot Django Unchained between 2011-2012, Tarantino gives the film a perfect look and atmosphere of the year 1858 (when the picture takes place). The buildings, the streets of dirt, the clothes...everything looks impeccably like it is 1858. The plantations in Tennessee (used for Don Johnson's character of ""Big Daddy"") and Mississippi (used for Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin J. Candie character) are beautiful and look not only old-fashioned, but also just as you would expect for Southern plantations to look like (trust me-I'm a Southerner!)

The adventure that all of Tarantino's characters go through in Django Unchained are pretty fun as well, and they have great humor to them. Who could ever forget Don Johnson leading a team of men who have trouble with the sheets used by the Ku Klux Klan, or a slave referring to a slave owner as ""snowball"" and getting away with it?!!?!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!!?!?!?!?! All of the actors execute both the comedy and the suspense impeccably. Leonardo DiCaprio shines in one of his first performances as a villain (and the villain whom Tarantino claims he had the most trouble bringing to life on the big screen, compared to every other villain character he has ever created). DiCaprio and Tarantino, together, bring to life an honest portrayal of the cruelty of many slave owners (next to those who provided an education for their slaves and never even beat them).

In spite of all of the good, there will be many people upset by Django Unchained. Spike Lee is one of them (while his criticism is understandable, please remember that Mr. Lee has not actually seen the picture--and says that he is not going to, saying that seeing the picture would be disrespectful to his ancestors who were all slaves). You have Tarantino's constant use of the ""N"" word--which is honest to the picture, of course, but always brings an uncomfortable feeling when it is used by a non-African American director. Much of the cruelty inflicted upon the slave characters in Django Unchained is very brutal, and a ""little bit too much."" Entertainment? The picture itself is, but a few scenes are a bit too harsh for entertainment.

Regardless, Tarantino does not glorify the ""N"" word, but instead uses it to give an honest depiction of what things were like back in the south in 1858. They say that ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder""--and both Jamie Foxx and Samuel L. Jackson have come out and said that they understand Tarantino's material for what it is as a picture, and for what it is not: a picture glorifying racism. Next to this, many of the slave characters of Django Unchained, when in peril, find happy endings. And the end is happy as well.

Django Unchained is not for everyone. Regardless, if you are a fan of Tarantino, DiCaprio, and/or western pictures, you will most likely find yourselves in for a great treat.",1358640000,9,4657,5.018111254851229
5261177,5,B00947NAHU,"""Django Unchained"" is awesome.  Admittedly, I am a Tarantino fan.  All of his movies have such a diverse and interesting cast of characters and such witty and interesting dialog that if one walks away from any of his films not entertained, somehow I think they may have either missed the point or they simply don't like Tarantino's style.  ""Django Unchained"" had everything... acts of justice and revenge, a beautiful and poignant love story, self sacrifice and laugh out loud humor.  Every emotion one could possibly have is intricately woven into the story of a former slave, who by chance, is rescued by and partnered with a benevolent German former dentist turned bounty hunter (lol) who ultimately helps his new companion buy his wife's (who speaks German, by the way) freedom from an artificially genteel, sociopathic plantation owner who is aided by a self hating, emotionally misdirected house slave.  How's that for cinematic range - LOL!!

Oh... and let's not overlook the fact that the main character is an African American man / hero who has loved, yearned and never forgotten about his African American wife who's rescue, it would seem, had always been his priority.  Sadly, one does not often see, even in today's cinema, two Black Americans cast in such a moving and evolved light (Thank You, Quentin!).  Every actor in this movie did an outstanding job -- -- and, in my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio's interpretation of his character (plantation owner Monsieur Calvin Candie) in ""Django Unchained"" is the best he's done since ""Romeo & Juliet"" and ""The Quick & The Dead"".  Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Christoph Waltz and Sam Jackson were fantastic...  Heck, even Don Johnson did a fantastic job!

A note of caution:  like many Tarantino films (*think ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Kill Bill Volume I"" and ""From Dusk Til Dawn""), the graphic violence in ""Django Unchained"" is high.  That is the one aspect of his movies that I've always had a difficult time with, but the plots, unique and quirky characters, awesome acting and ingenious dialog more than make up for it.

I believe this movie is one of the best, if not the best film Quentin Tarantino has done in his career and that's really saying something since his other movies aren't too shabby!  When it is released for download / dvd I will be purchasing it.

Loved this movie!!!",1358553600,7,2338,4.910941475826972
5261178,1,B00947NAHU,"I agree with Mr. Spike Lee that ""Django Unchained"" is disrespectful to our ancestors.  It causes me to want to spark a conversation about slavery; but more specifically, slavery in outer space. I tried to watch the movie; however about twenty-five minutes into it, I had to say enough's enough's enough. I couldn't sit there watching actors make a mockery of slavery. Slavery was and is too evil, too dark, too horrifying, too demonic to make light of it. Lots of people, Black people, mind you, said they loved the movie...LOVED IT. So, I wanted to watch it for two reasons: (1) To see if I would love it, like everybody else; and (2) To ferret out subliminal messages. But hey, I couldn't do it...I couldn't watch the whole of Django; it was too comical. I want to know, ""What the hell is funny about the KKK?"" They are the worst of the worst gang of terrorists. They are the androids that BURN THE CROSS, steal, kill, and murder innocent Black men, women, and children; all while calling themselves Christians...Is that Laughable?...Loveable? No, that is cruel-hearted, that is inhumane.

The movie was meant to be enjoyed only by the elk of those who want to laugh at the sight of violence and bloodshed, and who believe the Ku Klux Klan were bumbling nincompoops. As for me, I found myself weeping. I found myself remembering a vision I had on Azusa Street back in March 1994...a vision so horrible, that the deciphering of it catapulted me into spiritual bipolar. In the vision, I saw Black people in chains of bondage and God was making war to free us. God wanted us to realize that we are still under bondage and need to do something to help Him free us. We need to strive for freedom/manumission. Over the years, as I continued to decipher that vision, God taught me something more horrifying than the actual act of enslavement; He taught me about the WHO DID IT?...Jehovah/Zeus, Noah, Shem, Japheth, Abraham/Isaac/Jacob!! God showed me in a vision that if the heirs of those spirits make it up to Mars, they will enslave the Black man, again.

Did you see the taskmaster reading from the Bible while he brutally lashed Broomhilda? He read: ""And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered (Gen. 9:2).""

That's the mindset of the heirs of Shem and Japheth-- they believe Jehovah has delivered the Black man (whom they call Ham) into their hands for enslavement.  Those same heirs want us to have so much fear and dread of them that we will not call the Shemitic and Japhetic White man into God's/Aten divine justice chamber where they will have to answer for the sorcery they employ to help them fulfill Noah's prophesy that gives them dominion and rest as long as they keep Ham in bondage. But that's a little deep; let's talk about Broomhilda.

""What's her name?"" asked Dr. King.

""Broomhilda.""

""What?  Broomhilda!""

""Yes, Broomhilda von Shaft,"" Django answered.

Why the hullabaloo about Broomhilda?  Her name is a derivative of ""Brunhilda,"" which means ""READY FOR BATTLE.""
Who's ready for battle?...the writer of Django?...the director and producer of Django?...Dr. King Schultz, the heroic leader?...Django/Shaft and Broomhilda themselves?...the audience who watched Django and just ""Loved It!?""...Or, is it the people who bombed the moon that are ""READY FOR BATTLE!"" against the enslaved and against The Aten, the God of the enslaved?

No author/script writer/poet writes of his or her own volition, he or she is directed by the ""Muses!""  I submit to you that the whole of the subliminal message in ""Django Unchained"" (with its strategic release date on 25 December 2012, on the Day of The Lord), comes from the Muses, the spirits of Shem and Japheth.  They sent us a mind-blowing, bloody visualization depicting their readiness to enslave us again, this time on the planet Mars; and the message to God is that, to accomplish their task, they are ""READY FOR BATTLE.""

Now, it's my job to scour the WWW to find Detective Shaft so that I might warn him it is time to gather all the ""in-plain-sight"" clues left by the Muses of Mars...either Ham goes back into captivity...or Shem and Japheth go...but captivity is not over (Rev. 13:10).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spiritual-Bipolar-God-is-the-Peace-in-Your-Heart-that-Calms-the-Voices-Above-Your-Head/dp/0615560660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spiritual Bipolar: God is the Peace in Your Heart that Calms the Voices Above Your Head</a>",1358553600,15,4616,4.990885416666667

5261183,5,B00947NAHU,"I have to give Quentin Tarantino credit.  He not only directs great movies but he writes them as well.  This may be my favorite of his, which is saying a lot.  All of his work has a great deal of blood and violence in it so I assume anyone considering watching his work goes into it knowing this fact.  If you don't know that, then that is the only reason why you may not want to see this.  However, this film has so much more going on in it than blood and violence, that it will be a loss to miss it. And really, how could you make a movie about one of the most cruel and violent practices, slavery, without using a lot of blood and violence in turn?

One thing which will astound you is that there is a great deal of humor in this as well.  I almost bust a gut when the KKK riders discover that one of their riders' wives made the hoods wrong.  They can barely see through the hoods as they ride! That scene could have been straight out of Mel Brooks's BLAZING SADDLES.

The acting talent here is also just astonishing.  There are so many great performances and they just keep coming. So let me mention the top one right off the bat.  That is none other than Samuel L. Jackson playing the complete Uncle Tom to his master, Mr. Candy, played by Leonardo DiCaprio.  The only way I finally identified Jackson was through his voice as physically he is unrecognizable. He is the stooped over, grouchy, servile major domo to his lord and master.  DiCaprio, who has been a heartthrob for the ladies for years, must have loved playing the villainous slave owner and master.  Although he has tackled unheroic parts in the past, this is the first time he has been an out and out villain of the film.  He is ably supported by Walter Goggin of JUSTIFIED and THE SHIELD who is more used to playing the bad guy.

Christoph Waltz plays the bounty hunter who takes Jamie Foxx, Django, on as his partner in bounty hunting.  After they've made a great deal of money, they proceed to try to get Django's wife back.  She is currently owned by Candy (DiCaprio). Both Waltz and Foxx are excellent and Waltz is up for another supporting Oscar.  He previously won the supporting Oscar for Tarantino's movie before this one. I'm frankly surprised Jackson is not up for the supporting Oscar.

I've seen both this and LINCOLN and would have a hard time picking best film, director, etc., from these two in competition.  However, as lead actor, I believe Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln still remains unbeatable.

5261184,5,B00947NAHU,"Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a well spoken bounty hunter who acquires Django (Jamie Foxx) to find and kill some men who are wanted, ""dead or alive."" Dr. Schultz isn't too keen on the ""live"" part.

The film divides itself into two parts. After the bounty hunting episodes are through, our duo conceive a plan to rescue the wife of Django (Kerry Washington) by purchasing her from Candie Land plantation. Dr. Schultz has no stomach for slavery or slave owners. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't enter the film until the second part.

Like Tarantino films it incorporates humor. The bag over the head scene was reminiscent of something we might have seen in ""Blazing Saddles."" The flashbacks are minimal and not confusing. There is of course the over the top climatic ending and plenty of blood.

I have to question the use of the MF bomb several times in this picture. The first know usage of the word is the 1930s. It is speculated the phrase originated during slavery as a way to describe white owners who would take black mothers as comfort women. The phrase would of had a specific meaning and not used in the generic sense that Samuel L. Jackson tossed about.

5261185,4,B00947NAHU,"We are all intimately familiar with Tarantino's bag of tricks (splicing together all of his favorite generic bits/tropes from all of his favorite genre films, juxtaposing extreme violence with humor, underscoring and amplifying everything with sly musical selections) and we have all learned how to react to what Tarantino does, so, if you're a fan, this film will satisfy you in the way that each of Tarantino's previous films have satisfied you, and if you are still uncertain about how you feel about Tarantino this one isn't going to sway you one way or the other. Everyone knows by now that Tarantino films are all about revenge and the only real question is who will be the one seeking revenge and how cool will they look while settling their score. Maybe the one surprise with Django Unchained is that Tarantino doesn't do as much icon building with Django (Jamie Foxx) as he usually does with his leads. For most of the film, Django remains the strong silent type simply doing what Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) tells him to do, and he expresses himself only with strong looks of confusion (early on) or disapproval (in the latter half). But then western heroes are never talkers. They talk with their gun, and, of course, in Tarantino films, they talk with the soundtrack which is probably the most exciting thing about Django Unchained. The soundtrack is a strange mix of traditional cowboy balladry, classic Ennio Morricone theme music, classic folk (Ritchie Havens), and hard-edged hip hop (2pac). Thats how Tarantino turns Django into a legend, not with incredible acts of courage but with incredible musical selections. So its odd that Tarantino won an original screenplay Golden Globe for this film because this one is much less dialogue-driven than any of his previous films. Since all of the characters are generic types (by design) and since they all hold generic attitudes (by design), there is not a lot of need for words in this film, so the memorable bits are not really the verbal exchanges between characters but the musical interludes that place the central character on a plane, a level of intensity, of righteousness, that no one else has access to. The most fitting award for a film like this would be soundtrack or sound design or mix tape award. Its the soundtrack more than the stars that breathes life into the genre. Its the soundtrack that makes it all seem both old and new, both corny and cool, both iconographic and iconoclastic at the same time. I think what we ultimately have here is a cool exploitation picture that examines the mechanisms of cool. And thats pretty cool. The thing that I most appreciate about Tarantino is that you can tell he has a great time making his films and as you watch his films you can't help but smile at how much fun you are having watching them.",1358121600,6,2817,4.786447638603696

Judge this movie for what it is, not for individual PERCEPTIONS (or misconceptions).
THAT SAID, EVERYTHING about this MOVIE is BRILLIANT. The Entire cast (EVERYONE). ESPECIALLY, LEONARDO DICAPRIO.  HONORABLE MENTION, CRISTOPH WALTZ--STELLAR, and SAMUEL L. JACKSON.  JAMIE FOXX, who excels at everything he does, plays a restrained character (much of the time). And, let's not forget beautiful KERRY WASHINGTON in an effecting, nuanced performance. The screenplay is excellent and the soundtrack couldn't be better. The cinematography is exquisite. The violence is mostly blood splatter stuff (not chopped off body parts or cannibalism)--MOST of it is gunfight stuff. There's lots of that, but that's the DJANGO GENRE. As in Tarantino's Quirky PERSONNA, there is abundant LEVITY (HUMOR).

5261188,5,B00947NAHU,"How Quentin Tarantino takes his love of crappy B movies and distills out the essential best from usually low budget exploitation dross and cross pollinates genres to come up with something singular and unique is one of the more interesting phenomena in recent movie history.  Love him or hate him, his movies are their own thing and all of this obsession for spaghetti Westerns and Chop-socky martial arts films etc. would be for nought if he wasn't also a superb filmmaker.  All of this is on display, for good or ill, in Django Unchained.  Yes, it is over-the-top bloody to the point of parody.  It is also funny as hell.  And finally, it is one of the more honest depictions of the sheer brutality of slavery ever put on a film, and a perfectly raised middle finger to the romantic fantasy of Gone With the Wind and the decades of whitewashed history of that loathesome institution.

Thank heavens Tarantino and Christoph Waltz found each other.  He is absolutely wonderful here and Quentin has a fine actor who obviously relishes delivering Tarantino's delicious dialogue. It was one of those fortuitous meetings of talent that bring to mind Ford & Wayne and Scorcese & Deniro, a perfect blend of author and actor.  Sam Jackson is equally fine as always as a vehicle for whatever Tarantino needs from him.  Jamie Foxx plays well as Django, and Leonardo DiCaprio is up to the task as a vile slave master couching his own brutality in the trappings of wealth, privilege and overly fine manners. The character puts the lie to all that antebellum Southern plantation finery built upon a lie and the most detestable social construct imaginable.

But, that is the sober underpinnings to a typical Tarantino outing of politically incorrect dialogue and action, near cartoonish violence, and hilariously imagined situations and characters.  This isn't history, but with all the incongruous dialogue and attitudes for the period, it somehow hits a truth often missed in more period centered films.

Tarantino's films aren't for everyone.  The violence is excessively bloody, which will offput many.  I found it so overly bloody that it is obviously movie violence taken to the nth degree, and thus manifestly make-believe.  But, I don't know how that would apply to or effect impressionable minds (a discussion we will have for a long time).

I have always gone to Tarantino's movies expecting to dislike them and he always seems to win me over with the unexpected humor and the bravado and sheer inventiveness of the enterprise.  For a filmmaker with a reputation for violent action, I've never seen one who more effectively employs the closeup as a technique.  He loves to get right up in his actors faces as they deliver his wonderful lines.  And in every movie he will throw in something so unexpectedly funny as the scene here of Big Daddy's night riders bitching about the holes cut in the sacks they're wearing over their heads not allowing them to see where they're going.  That and many other non sequiters and assorted cleverness strewn through his films keeps me coming back.",1357862400,37,3081,4.888461538461539
5261189,5,B00947NAHU,"THis might be close to a run on review only because im a huge fan of tarantino's work, you simply cannot find another MAIN STREAM director that can get so close to a NC-17 rating while still slipping under the R rating.
Now to the actual movie.

IM NOT A FAN OF WESTERNS of any type, the style, the dialogue just bores me to death. With that said, this movie changed my perspective on how movies should be done. The dialogue is simply amazing, it seamlessly flows from one line to another and you simply cant wait for the next line to come up. Written phenominally (sorry no spell check). The characters themselves are great and very memorable, sly fox king shulze always wearing a smile but watch out if your a wanted man, especially if your son is farming with you ;). Calvington is actually my favorite out of all the characters, why, not too sure. It might be his tone of voice, his accent or maybe just how certain words slip off the tongue. Django is a statue true to his core, solid foundation.

Now this movie not only enlightens on what the olden days were, not exact but very similar minus the graphics and over the top gun fights. What i found very intriguing was the way tarantino used the degrading ""N"" word. He used the actual ""ER"" version very little while the ""gga"" version was througout and to me this was a very slick move on his part, almost throwin up in all these ""hoods"" and ""ghettos"" (not only them but also them little cliques in school wanting to be cool) faces to show that when they use this word, thats how degrading it was back then and surely the same these days, in my eyes anyway. So i really liked that.

Tarantino is a monster with movies. Every one of his movies to me is like another GTA title from rockstar, you know your getting top shelf, a+ quality everytime, you might not be fond of the story line /setting / actors / dialogue but the overall movie is hard to deny of worhtyness compared to the s*** we get fed every week from holly wood.

The soundtrack is simply amazing. A wide mix of every genre. Another sign of a great director using every outlet possible and not sticking to one page.
His cameo is patiently awated by someone like me that knows in his movie, there will at least be a 2 min clip of him doing somehting idiotic or being killed. In this case, well i won't spoil it. but i do think his first line in the movie was one of the funniest... Jango - ""Hey white boy..... HEY WHITE BOY""... Tarantino - ""Shut up BLACK"". simple but effective and hilarious by all means when you have an open mind just as he did when making this film..

5261190,3,B00947NAHU,"This film had some gruesome amazing action, it has some good dialogues, it doesn't have any defining moments like Death Proof or Kill Bill did. I feel Tarantino has changed something over the course of his last two films, I think he has started the subject matter of recreating period a tad too seriously. Foxx is amazing, Waltz is very good too but the film overall felt a little blase in the end because I was expecting to watch the film I waited for all year.

Django is not a bad film, it just tries too hard to be good at whatever it is trying to insinuate.  Samuel Jackson was annoying and Leonardo's character truly made me uncomfortable. A lot of talk of black and white which is always a welcome discussion but overall, Django Unchained will probably not be in my top 10 films of the year. Way many better films.",1357689600,2,821,4.394736842105263
5261191,5,B00947NAHU,"As an avid fan of Quentin Tarantino, there's a level of quality that I expect from each film that he makes. I expect to connect with his characters, but not necessarily like any of them. I expect to see a film that satisfies the film geek in me. More than anything, I expect to see a film that entertains throughout the prerequisite bloated running time.

""Django Unchained"" is nearly three hours long. But it never feels that long, it entertains and surprises every step along the way. When I first checked my watch, we were already two hours into the film. All of Tarantino's films are usually about this long. Tarantino has been having fun with fictionalizing historical periods lately. This started with 2009's ""Inglourious Basterds"", which was easily one of the best films of that year. My eighty-something year old grandmother, who lived through the time that the film depicted - World War II - said that if events actually happened as they did in that film, that we would be living in a better world today. I think that's a pretty high compliment, especially since my grandmother is not Tarantino's target audience. He was able to design a great story - not an idealistic view of that time period, but still a pretty fascinating one.

""Django"" is about slavery...a taboo subject in any film, a strangely popular one, recently, as the same time period is explored in ""Lincoln"". It's about Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is bought and then freed by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz, one-upping himself from the fantastic performance he gave in ""Basterds""), a dentist turned bounty hunter. White supremacist slave owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) bought and enslaved his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), and Django and Schultz are out to correct the grave injustice done to both of them, and this doesn't mean just capturing and killing Candie, but many others who are responsible for the trauma experienced by Broomhilda.

Christoph Waltz has got to be one of the finest living actors in Hollywood. He's incredibly charismatic, but he cares about his character, first and foremost. As the prime antagonist in ""Basterds"", he was positively horrifying. In this film, he's the hero, but at the same time, he's anything but that. He brings humor and depth to a character that wouldn't have worked this well otherwise. Jamie Foxx does a good job as well, but I don't necessarily see him winning anything this Oscar season.

I'm half-tempted to call ""Django"" Quentin Tarantino's superhero movie. Django is by no means that, he's an oppressed figure with no real ""super powers"", however he's a kick-ass guy who the audience roots for from the very beginning. He even has his own theme song! We don't know how he appears to be more literate than other slaves, and he is somehow always able to outsmart those around him.

""Django"" shows Tarantino having slightly more respect for genre than he ever has. It's a western revenge epic, first and foremost. It's also kind of a comedy, with some of the most clever dialogue I've heard in a film in 2012. It's also a romance, displaying the forbidden love between Django and his wife. But it's first and foremost a western, and Tarantino sticks to that.

This film isn't perfect, however. One thing I expect from Tarantino is well-developed strong female characters. We don't have that in ""Django"". I was hoping that Kerry Washington, who is also badass protagonist Olivia Pope in ABC's ""Scandal"", would be smart and strong-willed enough to get herself out of the problems which are out of her hands. I was hoping for Tarantino to give her some snappy dialogue, to show that her character is, like Django, superior to all of the other slaves around her. She isn't. She just kind of stands there and whimpers. She's helpless, and I wasn't expecting that from Tarantino, who has written some of the best female protagonists in film.

Other than this, ""Django Unchained"" is a masterful film. It takes alot for a nearly three hour long film to be engaging the entire way through, and it is. It's wickedly funny, and at the same time, extremely dramatic. With its graphic violence and filthy mouth, it isn't for the faint of heart. All of the actors here, especially DiCaprio, seem to be having tons of fun here, and it shows. Tarantino loves to fictionalize history, and if such films are as good as ""Django Unchained"", I think he should keep doing it. It's a vision of history that only Tarantino can bring us.

Grade: A-",1357603200,213,4471,4.8125
5261192,5,B00947NAHU,"My whole brain starts in the 80's, so for me this film is more likely to send me backwards to study the various influences that led up to a film like this. Adversely, your enjoyment of it is not strictly hinged on how many of it's winks and nods (to other films, genres, etc.) you can pick up on. It appears that several other reviewers have already laid out a laundry list of past films whereby we can view and see the roots of all the stylistic hallmarks in Django. It was much easier for me to diagnose influence with a film like ""Drive"" which utilized somewhat younger points of reference (Halloween, Apocalypse Now, Cape Fear, etc.)

That being said, for the purpose of my review I will only compare this to Tarantino's past work. This is my first time to fall in love with one of his movies for reasons that don't include wild collages of plot twists. For my taste, Inglorious Basterds was too jarring in the way it constantly shifted from a boring crawl to ultra-violence, and I just didn't follow the plot as well as any of his other movies. Django, however, is very strait-forward and perhaps the first movie he made that does not rely on the same ADD hodge-podge of mini-plots. He still works with an ensemble cast, one of his other hallmarks, but they seem to be presented in a fairly linear fashion. This was the reason I didn't initially care for Jackie Brown. It seemed like a normal movie when I expected a movie made by a weirdo. So, it's sort of odd that this is supposedly part of a revisionist trilogy, which includes the very non-strait-forward plot style of Inglorious Basterds. Make of it what you will, but I see a lot of similarities between Django and Jackie Brown, in terms of the focused plot design and the way it takes an old genre and embellishes it in a way that is both familiar and entirely new.

Although this film feels like Tarantino's least self-referential film yet, it's not all ""worship and tribute"" when compared to Kill Bill. To the contrary, it shines a vivid light on his eye for detail. Many may say that this is the same bloodfest as Kill Bill, but it's not. Bill 1 & 2 were infamous for the blood shooting across the room, but this is not an arbitrary style element. It is an element which is pertinent, because it's depicting slice wounds from swords, primarily. Seriously, watch the blood style in Django; the blood explodes visually with sounds resembling sacks of water bursting open. Both this and Kill Bill are fairly loyal genre films, and many people just see blood or whatever, but Tarantino does very detailed work. Even when he is exaggerating the exact intensity of the blood, he's doing it with a controlled style.

I went into this movie expecting what my friend called ""the most violent thing I've ever seen,"" and ""more violent than Drive."" I didn't really think it was the most violent, but moreso surprisingly consistent to Tarantino's other films. It is my understanding that the test audiences had a visceral reaction which led the director to trim down the mandingo scene, the dog attack scene, and maybe one or two other scenes. I'm glad, because as it stands, it narrowly avoided being indulgent. Had the camera held perfectly still at one angle, like Drive, then the violence would have been less bearable. I don't think I would like the director's cut, because if the violence against the slaves goes too far, then the viewer feels more numb towards the violence executed by the slaves out of revenge. On that note, I could have handled seeing at least another minute or two of Django whipping the slave master, no matter if it was merely a wink to ""Roots"" or not.

My wife went into the movie expecting the violence to go too far, but she left feeling like it was a good movie. I think the humor was very important to strike the right balance. Tarantino's humor has always been a major asset to his films, and this is no exception. My wife even said she thinks my mom might watch it; I'm not so sure about that (a bit squeamish), but I think my dad and my brother will like it. This is a great film, that goes to a lot of length (no pun intended) to tow the line between all of it's elements, from comedy, to history, to gore...every element has a deliberate and carefully calculated execution. I would watch this as an HBO series. Every single actor delivers an absolutely stellar performance.",1357603200,10,4366,4.543837357052096
5261193,5,B00947NAHU,"A film like this is difficult to define so perhaps the way I should talk about it is to just make some points and observations.  It is clear to me that Tarantino's view of the world is not the run of the mill.  He has an enquiring mind which informs how he approaches film making and the intellectual and visual stimuli he employs in his films. He makes you think about conclusions which you had drawn about certain things and makes you ask yourself whether you were lazy in the first place to have drawn them.
This movie is about a German bounty hunter in search of his ""subjects"" and who enlists the help of a slave, Django (whom he frees at his first meeting) and who is his constant companion throughout the movie on that search.  Django, the freed man, is also in search.  He is in search for his German speaking slave wife/woman of his dreams who was cruelly separated from him. I shall not go into the long climax of the movie save to say that the violence is quite spectacular (some might say gratuitous - but that is the point) and strangely beautiful in a visual sense.
Calvin Candie, an unbelievably malevolent plantation owner, played by Leonardo di Caprio is clearly the star of this movie whilst Christoph Waltz plays Dr. King Schultz (a retired dentist) who is the bounty hunter.  They are both Academy Award winners and their performances are breathtaking. Jamie Foxx who plays Django is someone you instinctively support throughout the movie and delivers a performance that also will not escape Oscar attention.
It could be said that the overall premise of this movie is unlikely but I don't think that that is really the point. This movie, I think even more than Inglorious Basterds (Tarantino's great film that garnered Christoph his well deserved Oscar - one of the best acting performances I have ever seen!), leaves you with images that haunt in a way that is well nigh inexplicable save to say that they captivated when they first occurred even if you had no idea they would.  It will never be to everyone's taste but then, this is Tarantino we are talking about!",1357603200,8,2086,4.609164420485175

Django Unchained is supposedly a very loose reworking Sergio Corbucci's spaghetti western Django. I believe it has a closer affiliation to the exploitation cult film Mandingo (1975) about a slave taught to fight other slaves  this movie for its time was somewhat an outrageous product, a film that Mr Tarantino has praised, while by and large the critics' have rejected the film with extreme disapproval.

The lead actor is played by Foxx, who plays the Django, a slave who is in a chain gang, across their path comes one Dr King Schultz, a German who is well-groomed and rather unconventional in his ways, he claims to be a travelling dentist; Schultz carriage is a small wagon with a huge model of a molar tooth on the top. Our Shultz, after some initial reluctance from the slavers, buys Django and promises him his freedom in return for a favour: he needs Django to help him track three white fugitives that have a bounty on their heads.

As the narrative progress, we find that Django proves himself a good assistant and a talented shot. Through some back story, we find that Django was married and his wife speaks the German language and she was named Br&uuml;nnhilde, unfortunately, her current owners mishear her name and call her ""Broomhilda"". Due to her predilection for running away, she is branded on the face and forced to work as a ""comfort"" girl. As mutual respect sets in between the eccentric German and Django, it is agreed that that will rescue his wife Br&uuml;nnhilde.

Through the story, we meet inept KKK posse the characters are somewhat reminiscent of the KKK in Blazing Saddles. We then meet with Candie (played rather eloquently by DiCaprio) the owner of Candyland Plantation his evil is only matched by his apparent need to sound and look charming. Django needs all his guile to pretend to be that of the most hated of things, a ""Mandingo"", a fighter-promoter his double dealing is only matched to Stephen's domestic bondage to his master and his family, aptly played Samuel Jackson.

There are moments of pure brilliant direction mastery of the rather over the top violence and I feel the overuse of the N-word, was not needed. At two hours and 45 Django is a long film - undoubtedly, this film better than Tarantinos WW2 film Inglourious Basterds. The relationship between Schultz and Django is well managed and their friendship really looks convincing and their resulting comedic episodes are well done. Well, worth a four-star rating  with flaws.

5261196,4,B00947NAHU,"Tarantino's ""Django Unchained"" is a journey into the heart of darkness, filled with blood, gore, and great performances from all the cast. Jamie Foxx stars as Django, a slave turned free by a bounty hunter named Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz. Doc Schultz and Django go looking for some bad men, so Schultz can kill them and collect the bounty. After the deed is done, Schultz helps Django find the slave-owner who owns Django's wife. The film unfolds from there, and I will let the viewer learn for himself/herself as to what happens.

I will say this: the movie is incredibly violent, probably the most violent Tarantino film since Reservoir Dogs, and Kill Bill Vol. 1. As a Tarantino fan, I consider both Kill Bills to be one film, so I will say taking that into account, Django Unchained is as violent as Reservoir Dogs. The performances in this movie are excellent. DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson, as the plantation owner Calvin Candie and his servant Steven, are the best in my opinion.

The film is an homage to violent Spaghetti Western movies from the 60s and 70s. If you're a fan of Spaghetti Westerns, you will probably enjoy the movie. There are close-ups of some of the characters that will remind Western fans of the ""close-ups"" Sergio Leone used in the Fistful of Dollars trilogy. While many of Tarantino's movies are told in a non-linear narrative structure, meaning the film isn't necessarily presented as a beginning-middle-end, ""Django Unchained"" is told in a very straight-forward way. The film follows a path of beginning to middle to end.

The film isn't perfect however. I think the set-up to Django searching for his wife takes a little too long to develop. Also, most of the secondary characters aren't well developed. We don't understand why Steven is so loyal to Candie. We don't know much about Django's wife, either.

5261197,4,B00947NAHU,"Django unchained is similar to Inglorious in that it retains the entertaining if unashamedly ignorant nature of the latter. However, where it falls short of Inglorious is in its reliance on just 4, static, characters to drive a ""single"" plot (Basterds had two divergent plots and although many of its characters were static, it had a lot more of them. Though some may argue that there were one too many) , something which, considering the length of the movie, wears a bit thin towards the end. Despite this, all the characters are well done and are very well acted with Samuel L Jackson's character proving to be the most interesting of the four (his style reminded me a bit of Grima from the Two Towers).",1357516800,6,705,4.648

5261199,3,B00947NAHU,"Silent letters are stupid and I don't really like Jamie Fox, but such nuisances are beside the point. It's the plot of Django Unchained, a historic epic of sorts in which Fox plays a negro slave turned contract killer, that's the problem. The first half or so actually presents an interesting plotline as we travel with Django, led by fellow bounty hunter King Schultz; Christoph Waltz as the movie's coolest character; to a ""MISSISSIPPI"" plantation to free his (Django's) estranged wife. The final stretch is where everything sort of falls apart. Quentin Tarantino may be one of the best movie-makers pop cinema has to offer, yes, but this one suffers from what seems to be a simple case of artistic overindulgence. That final stretch, which begins with a ridiculous shoot-out, comes across as an unnecessary tack-on to what, though nowhere near his Inglourious Basterds magnum opus, could've been an enjoyable movie.

A dinner scene involving a head slave named Stephen and a secret being revealed unravels too conveniently; there isn't enough reason given for Stephen's sudden plot-turning suspicion; but there are moments of genuine tension there. You wonder, if only for a minute or two, whether or not the protagonists will make it out alive. That's it though. There is no real tension or suspense anywhere else in the movie, which also lacks in the way of humor. Brutal violence breaks itself for chuckle time, and sometimes that works; a scene involving a blind lynch mob on horseback nears hilarity; but the movie's many comedy attempts too often fall flat. Quentin Tarantino composed the words, but the general dialogue is missing his signature zing. There's not really any cleverness or grand irony here. Nothing wows, at-least not in a positive sense. It's just a slightly engaging slave story that goes on for too long.

I'm going to be bold and say this about this Antebellum Opus. This is Tarantino's Best movie and finest movie. Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown following close. From the writing, to the photography, to the actors, to the story, and the music, Tarantino did not disappoint. He is the best American Director out there who doesn't follow Hollywood guidelines and churn out drivel every year. The man can write as one can see from his early Screenplay of True Romance and bubble gum chewing dialogue in Pulp Fiction. Some would say he got too indulgent, too wordy, too long of monologues, such as in Kill Bill Vol. 2, Death Proof, and Inglorious Basterds. The man knows how to write tense scenes that make you hold your breath, chew your nails then have it burst with visceral violence. The running time of this movie, clocks in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, it goes by at a fine pace. Unlike the tad draggy Inglorious Basterds. We all know his movies are homages to what he loves of certain movies and actors. I feel his direction has become tighter and his collaboration with DOP Robert Richardson shows what he wants in a scene. Sadly his long time editor and collaborator Sally Menke passed and was a great editor and knew how to piece a scene together. All Tarantino fans might notice the different cuts of this film where it did feel a little choppy and some of the subtleness she brought that was inherent in all of her other work on Tarantino movies was not there. Then there is the music, Tarantino knows how to match scenes with music. This movie has a vast array of Spaghetti Western instrumental to 1960s songs to modern day rap. Another director that comes to mind that does this well is Wes Anderson (Second best director working that doesn't make a movie for the sake of making it)  One of my favorite scenes in DU is the one where Jamie Foxx is pleading with Big John not to whip his wife and then a cut of them running away, the color pallet is grainy and an almost washed out feel. Because it's a flash back scene. How he cut this scene with the music, it's heart breaking. A beautiful scene indeed. He gets 100% out of his actors, it's great seeing Di Caprio as Calvin Candie, playing a despicable human being, pushes the role to a level where it doesn't reach absurdity or over the top, he does indeed steal the movie. Same goes with Samuel L. Jackson playing his loyal house slave Stephen who has more power than one would think,and Christoph Waltz as the German mentor/ bounty hunter who as the only white man treats Django as an equal and does not consider him lower than he. And Kerry Washington as Broomhilda, Django's wife, she is so beautiful, I could not believe how Angelic she looked in one scene. I was in awe. After a second viewing-- I mean come on every Tarantino film deserves a second viewing in the theater--- Jamie Foxx did a very fine job with his character/ role. So nuanced, low key in the beginning, then he ramps it up in the second half. Foxx was the right actor for this role. I have heard Tarantino had a 3 hour cut and had to be trimmed, do hope for the DVD we get these scenes. I hear it goes more in character development with Django and Broomhilda, and scenes with Stephen  & Candie . Some will say the violence is very gratuitous even for Tarantino. Could it be a dig at critics when they said Inglorious Basterds didn't have enough action? A self wink to Quentin who maybe thought well ok they want action I'll give them lots of bullets and buckets of blood. In my opinion, this is an homage to Spaghetti Westerns. They did have outrageous shootouts. This does too. Tarantino delivered everything I hoped for. That is why I am saying this is his best film to date.",1357171200,5,3774,4.427338129496403

The acting is award worthy across the board. The music is beautiful, clever, and odd (in a very good way). However I must worn the faint of heart, Quentin Tarantino is an artist and his favorite medium is gore. So if your not down with blood, be warned. However blood and gore are not his only specialties. Quentin Tarantino certainly stretches his dialogue muscles throughout the entire film. Each scene is filled to the brim with an expansive and cleverly used vocabulary. The director and actors have also managed to keep a perfect balance between the gruesome and scarring history behind slavery and an extremely new and hilarious take on the dark time period. The film truly hits you hard with rough images, but repays you with an extraordinary sense of well timed humor. And if the movie doesn't repay in comedy, it repays with some of the most awesome, intense, kick-ass, and gruesome shoot outs you've ever experienced. I've watched the movie twice now and the three HUGE shoot outs in the film never cease to get me all pumped up. It's almost impossible to not stand up in your seat fist pumping and yelling, ""Get those white guys!"" and I'm caucasian myself. There is so much more to be said, however I will leave you to experience the rest. This is every film aficionado's dream. If you love an Oscar worthy film that makes you feel like a cheering football super fan every time a gun is on screen, this is your movie. I also strongly recommend checking out Quentin Tarantino's other work. It's all outstanding if not better than Django Unchained. I honestly hope you enjoy the film and fall in love like I have.",1357084800,5,1777,4.591194968553459
5261210,4,B00947NAHU,"****1/2
When watching a Quentin Tarantino film, there are a lot of familiar elements to be expected: An inventive pastiche of genres (often delivered with tongue firmly in cheek). Excessive, cartoonish violence. The use of iconic actors in often unexpected roles. Scenes full of clever, tense dialog that often end up exploding in brutality. And, if you look carefully, hidden beneath all the flash and stunts and gore, moments of genuine emotional resonance.

By all this criteria, ""Django Unchained"" is typical Tarantino. What makes the film unique among his cannon, and so controversial, is its subject matter. After all, is there any more subject more taboo in modern America than race? And does anything stir up more complex and unresolved feelings among the races than by bringing up our country's shameful history of slavery?

First and foremost, this film is extremely entertaining. I often get bored or impatient during long films, but not once during it's almost three hour running time did I check the time. It's thrilling, it's funny, it's clever, it's visually interesting and emotionally engaging. The story itself is really fairly straightforward: a bounty hunter (Christopher Waltz) frees a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), makes him his partner, and then agrees to help him free his slave wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio). It's not the plot, but the characters that make the film so fresh and engaging. Django, although the titular character, is probably the least interesting in the film. He's strong and stoic in the tradition of Clint Eastwood, and it is great fun watching him dole out justice, but he doesn't get any of the good dialogue. Dr. King Schultz, Django's mentor, probably carries the first half of the film. He's charming, verbose, calculating, and equally capable of great compassion and ruthless violence, depending on which he seems to think the situation calls for.

The film's second half belongs to the dual villains of DiCaprio's Calvin Candie, a ruthless psychopath masquerading as a southern gentleman, and his house slave/Svengali Steven (Samuel L Jackson). The juxtaposition of the two despicable characters together drive home a subtle point: that slavery wasn't just about race, but about the dark, ruthless nature of human beings to want to control, dominate and subjugate other human beings. As entitled and evil as Candie is, Steven is just as willing to go to abhorrent lengths to maintain the status quo, because the status quo has afforded him as much power and control over others as he could possibly be allowed in his position.",1357084800,11,2624,5.169411764705882
5261211,4,B00947NAHU,"German Bounty Hunter/Dentist played by Christopher Waltz (who we last saw in Inglorious Basterds) tries to buy Django (Jamie Foxx) from a slaver. The reason? Django can identify three brothers who Waltz is hunting for a bounty. Waltz lets Django know that if he goes with him and points out his bounty, he will free Django and pay him for his trouble.

Django agrees to Waltz's offer and Waltz can only get him from the slavers in dramatic fashion (reminicent of Gene Wilder in Blazing Saddles). After that Django becomes Waltz's right hand man in the trade and also turns into a quick draw sharpshooter himself. Waltz seems to take a real liking to Django and agrees to help Django find his wife who was sold off to a separate plantation owner.

The movie is loaded with a lot of nods to other famous westerns and at least two more nods to Blazing Saddles (think Cleavon Little when he first rides into town and remember the hooded bad guys later in the film). The film does go over the top with some of the action scenes (think the battle in the club at the end of Kill Bill). And even Samuel Jackson with bad makeup and one of his poorer acting performances fails to distract from the fun of the movie.

What really makes this film a winner is Waltz. He is a similar character to his role in Inglorious Basterds (remember one of the most likable bad guys ever) only this time he is a good guy. Foxx is ok but his performance pales in comparison to the one he gave in Collateral. The film runs over 2 hours but it never seems to get borring. Of all the Quentin Tarrantino films I have seen this one is about equal to the first Kill Bill film, but a far cry from either Pulp Fiction or Inglorious Basterds. I give it just under four stars.",1357084800,3,1740,4.3476923076923075
5261212,5,B00947NAHU,"Some friends and I saw this tonight, and I was pleasantly surprised. I loved it. I've seen it twice so far. Definitely one of my favorite Tarantino movies. It was very entertaining. Filled with action, comedy, gore, history, suspense, and interesting characters. It had beautiful scenery, a great storyline and great sets. Jamie Foxx stars as Django, a slave who is recently saved and freed by a German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz. Schultz needs Django's help to hunt down the Brittle brothers. In exchange, Schultz will help Django find Calvin Candie, the man who bought his wife, Broomhilda. This was probably the coolest western movie I've seen in years. It had a great revenge theme. If you are offended by slavery and the 'n' word, you might not like it, but I would definitely recommend DJANGO UNCHAINED!!!

5261213,3,B00947NAHU,"Classic Tarantino. Outstanding example of Tarantino movie making technical abilities with an interesting story for a Tarantino vehicle, holding the audience attention for the movie length.

Why three stars?  The  horrifying depiction of southern whites makes the racial overtones of Django the 21st Century's equivalent to ""Birth of a Nation"" which at the time was considered a technical marvel and interesting story.  ""Birth of a Nation"" depicted the Klu Klux Klan as a positive force when confronting ""uppity"" and dangerous blacks, the film maker earning revenue from then 1912 racial prejudices (receiving critical praise from then President Woodrow Wilson). So too Django generates revenue from the one acceptable racial prejudice in 2012, prejudice against whites (I wonder if our current President has the same critical praise for Django Unchained as his predecessor felt for Birth of a Nation?).  The character Django is depicted in the movie as a hero only to blacks as he kills American whites male and female.

Django is an exhibition of fashionable Hollywood hatred of America delivered brilliantly by Tarantino.

The only good white man is a German.  In Inglorious Bastards there are good Germans and there are bad Germans, Germans who are not Nazi and Germans who are Nazi.  No such distinction is depicted by Django.  All southern whites are bad and deserve to die (and they all do die in classic Tarantino style).

In Inglorious Bastards Germans choose to be Nazi. In Django, southerners as a group and culture exhibit the racial preference of oppressing and harm blacks, an inbred desire.  Such a depiction of southern whites is blatantly racist.

The tragedy of Django is the propaganda of the movie, especially given the politics of 2012.  Just as depicting blacks in ""Birth of a Nation"" as bad and the Klu Klux Khan good, so depicting southern whites as bad and a white killing black as a good ""hero"" ruins and makes trivial an otherwise good Tarantino movie.

1/6/2013

An additional thought:  If Tarantino intended Django Unchained as a 21st Century version of Blazing Saddles, then Tarantino failed. Mel Brooks depicted in Blazing Saddles as foolish and silly anyone holding prejudice of any type (including English attitudes toward the Irish).

Tarantino's message in Django Unchained appears to be the only good pre Civil War white southerner was a dead white southerner, certainly not the joke presented in Blazing Saddles.  Hopefully Tarantino was not intending pre Civil War white southerners as a metaphor for white America today, though depicting the only good white as a German (presumably without Nazi tendencies) I believe the metaphor was intended.

Amazingly, individuals in the movie industry associated with producing Blazing Saddles recently stated the movie with its irreverent depictions of prejudice could not be produced today.  Yet we now have Django Unchained generating revenue from the 21st Century's one acceptable prejudice, condemning American Caucasians.

2/17/2013

The morality of ""Django Unchained"" and ""Birth of a Nation"" is no different than the moral justification of Christopher Dorner actions. Killing the innocent is justified by the 21st Century's one acceptable prejudice, condemning American Caucasians.

5261214,5,B00947NAHU,"I will start by saying this movie is very different from Tarantino's previous works. As far as I know, this is his first film that follows the traditional chronological order. Additionally, we follow Django around most of the film, similar to how we follow the Bride in the Kill Bill series. This is different from, say, Pulp Fiction or Inglourious Basterds. While I prefer the more epic storytelling style better, that didn't hold me back from loving this film. The writing in this film doesn't disappoint. It meets the high standard Tarantino has set with his previous films. There really wasn't a dull moment in this film. This film was very dark at times, from a vicious Mandingo fight (in my opinion, the most brutal scene), to a man getting ripped apart by bloodthirsty dogs. However, a very healthy dose of humor made it easier to watch. There were scenes where I couldn't believe my eyes, and there were other scenes where I was in tears from laughter, and neither side seemed to outweigh the other. Jamie Foxx was good in this, however, Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio really stole the show. I really liked Waltz's character as a German bounty hunter better than his portrayal as ""The Jew Hunter"" in Inglourious Basterds. It was also clever how they stuck in the original Django in the bar scene. One actor that I wish I could have seen more of was Walton Goggins as Billy Crash. I have always said he is a great actor and I loved his character on The Shield, I just wish we got to see more of his character in this work. There were some interesting musical cues to say the least. I love the soundtrack, especially the ""Django"" theme. Even the hip-hop worked for such a historical setting, which was hilariously awesome, and maybe even a first for cinema. Django Unchained is anything but predictable, and I absolutely loved the last 30 minutes of the film.

I don't have a lot of complaints about this film, but I do have a few that are worth discussing. First and foremost: there are a few pacing issues in Django Unchained, most prominently near the climax of the film. Some scenes seemed a bit too long, and some were too short. However, these pacing issues weren't enough to hinder the film's flow. Secondly, I thought Quentin Tarantino's appearance in this film should have been omitted. His performance was poor, to say the least. Maybe I've watched one too many interviews with him, but I wasn't buying his fake southern accent. Pulp Fiction Tarantino: Yes. Django Unchained Tarantino: No. I guess that's what you get from a director that always has cameos in his films: either a hit or miss.

Django Unchained is one of the best films I've seen this year, if not, the best. It's right up there with Looper, and I am already anticipating Django's Blu-Ray release. Django Unchained is a bloody, brutal, hilarious, and bold film that throws us into America's dark past of slavery and adds a dash of fantasy to it to make a phenomenal Western (or Southern, as QT insists it is?). Of all of Quentin Tarantino's films, I'd say this is one that is the most straightforward and easiest to follow, which may be a good entry film for QT newbies to start at. All in all, this is a highly recommended film that I consider to be classic Tarantino.",1356912000,4,3258,4.625215889464594
5261215,4,B00947NAHU,"***This review may contain spoilers***

  The title of my review references Peter Jackson's utterly unhinged zombie infestation cult horror classic.  In ""Dead Alive"", the unlikely hero decimates zombie hordes until the screen literally floods with blood.  In a way, ""Django Unchained"" (hereafter ""Django"") reflects ""Dead Alive""'s ""go nuts with killing until you stop being scared and disgusted and just have to laugh"" sensibility.  As Django (Jamie Foxx) ascends from slave to bounty hunter to talented gunslinger to determined avenger and savior, the viewer is inundated with so many killings, humiliating tortures, mutilations, and explosions, he/she may stop being disgusted and overwhelmed, and simply laugh at the brutal inanity of it all.  I think that was director Quentin Tarantino's intentional satiric objective.

  Reviewer M. Oleson also alludes to ""Blazing Saddles"" as one of ""Django""'s inspirations, and I think he is correct.  However, satirizing the West's violent ignorance and flimsy attempts at justice were, I believe, Tarantino's secondary targets.  Even the abominably shameful institution of pre-Civil War slavery and the unscrupulous but dense Southerners who strained to uphold it is a secondary, easy-bullseye for ""Django""'s satire.  As other posters here have mentioned, Tarantino, as he has done before, is slyly satirizing our near-sexual fetish for and obsession with and gradual desensitization to violence in general.

  Many people are shot in ""Django"".  The lucky ones die quickly with little blood.  The unlucky ones realistically scream with pain as blood erupts from them like geysers.  Initially, the audience may recoil or cheer in response, depending on whether the character shot ""deserves"" it or not.  But eventually, poetic justice does prevail in ""Django"" and we laughingly and apparently appropriately cheer as decadent, immoral Southern plantation society is literally blasted to smithereens.  But will we necessarily respect ourselves the following morning?

  No matter how you feel later, I think ""Django"" viewers will be entertainingly uplifted, not only by Django's composed, steely determination to avenge his bondage and to be reunited with his abused but beautiful and equally resilient wife Brunhilde (Hildy) (Kerry Washington), but also by the unflappable reasoning and eloquence of Django's own deliverer, the deceptively unassuming Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). But even Django's reprehensible villains are also humoroulsy captivating, such as the unctuously effete but vicious pseudo-Francophile Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), the slimy ""Candieland"" (ho ho!) plantation owner who holds Hildy in thrall, and especially the obsequious but treacherous Candieland slave retainer, played by the endlessly versatile Samuel L. Jackson. Of course, they suffer shocking deaths, but Candie and Stephen come so skillfully close to being such cartoonish heavies, again we permit ourselves to cheer and laugh when they die.

  Tarantino in a sense has it both ways with the violence.  We are allowed to enjoy the violence when a villain buys it, but we do shudder with loathing when the ""good guys"" suffer.  When Hildy is locked naked in a hot box for some perceived slight, or Django is hung upside down naked with castration imminent, I'm sure almost no viewer will laugh.  So there's our ambivalence towards violence and death - are they cathartic or poisonous? If violence's victims are faceless zombies as in ""Dead Alive"" or foolish Southern whites (who cant even make KKK masks with periperhal vision) as in ""Django"", we laugh with relief.  If violence's victims are the geeky hero in ""Dead Alive"" or suave slave-turned-avenger Django or wily, rational bounty hunter Dr. Schwartz, we cry with despair.  Especially in light of recent serial killings, this evocation of violence's dual nature merits further debate.",1356912000,5,3878,5.5536626916524705
5261216,5,B00947NAHU,"...because this brand new QT masterpiece has a lot of elements of the 1975 blaxploitation-Western 'Boss N*****', in which he wrote the screenplay and co-produced. DJANGO UNCHAINED brings this rare and forgotten subgenre back to life in a big-budgeted way with Jamie Foxx in the title role as a slave in pre-Civil War Texas rescued and trained by Dr. Schultz, a flamboyant German bounty hunter (Waltz steals the entire show once again). Together the odd duo go on a mission to save Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of plantation entrepreneur Calvin Candie (brilliantly mean and villainous Di Caprio) and his Uncle Tom/Ruckus house servant Stephen (hilariously over-the-top Sam Jackson).

I thought the film worked up until the character played by Christopher Waltz (who was great in this) was killed then the story meanders and falls apart. Other things that bothered me. The sequence where they played the Jim Croce song ""I got a name""......why in the hell did Tarantino pick this song? I understand the Morricone cues scattered throughout the film as well as the opening theme which was ripped from the 1966 movie Django, and somewhat the rap songs since it is a blaxplotation film to some degree. But the Jim Croce selection from 1973 brings up images (for me anyway) of gas stations,18-wheelers,and bell bottoms. Also the huge shootout I had issues with. How many white henchmen were on this plantation? 25? 50? I was thinking to myself ""where were these people when they came up on the plantation?"" And then Django is magically protected from dozens of bullets by a cabinet??? The character played by Samuel L Jackson, a slave, yells at the white people to ""Stop shooting!""........and they actually listen to him????? Django would have been killed on site,not saved by a slave then sent off to a mine to break down rocks. Perhaps I am being too critical and should have just allowed myself to enjoy the film for what it is. And about my previous issue with all the white southerners that were shot. I guess in most Tarantino films you have unrealistic mass killings. In Inglorious Basterds you have the Nazi who is in the tower and shoots a hundred or so soldiers. In Kill Bill you have Uma who slices and dices about 20 or so Ninjas in a scene. I will close with this. Django Unchained in this day of mindless 3-D action movies, remakes, and dime a dozen romantic comedies is a breath of fresh air. And the first half of the movie is great.

Django Unchained is the most fun I had at the theater in 2012.  The dialog is perfect, the pacing is fantastic, and the characters are insane.

But I guess all that wouldn't fit on the poster.

  Django has everything you'd want in a movie, action, humor, suspense, drama, and even some romance, all washed down with gallons of blood. Did I mention some beautiful western vistas? it's got those too. And there are plenty of refernces to some of the geat westerns of the past, some of them only visual so pay attention. There is the trade mark Tarantino dialogue as well.

 I'm sure other reviewers will talk about racial-political implications and social commentary and such. I'm not that smart. I just thought this was a fast paced and satisfying film for movie fans from beginning to end. Leonardo Di Caprio makes for a great villain, keeping himself just this side of over-the-top.

5261221,5,B00947NAHU,"It's been almost 24 hours since I saw Quentin Tarantino's latest effort, and I still have mixed feelings. The first thing that you should know is that he is probably my favorite director. While his movies don't quite reach the heights of David Lynch's Mulholland Dr., he is responsible for more movies in my Top 20 than any other director. His movies have a unique feel and I love spending time in his worlds.

If you have somehow never seen a Tarantino movie, I should mention that they are not for everyone. All feature a significant amount of violence, although the majority of the situations are so ludicrous that you aren't meant to take things seriously. I would say that every Tarantino movie is, at heart, a comedy, but his brand of comedy is darker than most. It doesn't matter whether you usually don't like war, Westerns, crime, or kung fu movies, because Tarantino creates a genre of his own. Like Monty Python, the humor is extremely silly, but works because of its underlying intelligence.

It's necessary for you to understand the love and respect I have for Tarantino's work in order to appreciate the significance of my eventual rating.

Let's get to Django Unchained.

Settings include Texas, Mississippi, and Tennessee, and the opening scene takes place in 1858 (two years before the Civil War). It's clear from the start that this isn't going to be a conventional story. Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a bounty hunter posing as a dentist. We see him free Django (Jamie Foxx) from slavers, while giving the remaining captives their freedom and the ability to decide their own fate. Schultz enters into an agreement with Django, and the two spend the remainder of the year together as bounty hunters. Schultz ultimately discovers that Django is seeking his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), and decides to help him. That involves searching every plantation until they find her.

The plot is of little consequence in Django Unchained. Like every other Tarantino movie, this is more about style. If you are looking for plot holes or deep meaning, you have chosen the wrong director. I know that many people will be offended by the subject matter, the violence, and the foul language, but I'm almost certain that Tarantino merely intends to entertain and provide as much fun as possible along the way. I obviously detest the thought of slavery, and people being whipped or murdered, but it wasn't really on my mind as I watched the movie. The tongue-in-cheek tone allowed me to separate the hideous events from any semblance of reality.

The main reason I like Tarantino's work so much is because it is creative, and contains some of the best dialogue you'll ever hear. Those elements are present in Django Unchained, and some scenes and conversations work wonderfully. The bulk of the good scenes involve Christoph Waltz, who is essentially playing Hans Landa. Expect flowery dialogue delivered in a very deliberate way. He can talk his way out of almost any situation and he's full of surprises. If you can't imagine a scene involving the Ku Klux Klan being funny, Tarantino somehow pulls it off.

Foxx does a reasonable job as Django, but I can't help thinking what Will Smith might have done with the role. DiCaprio plays Calvin Candie, who owns a plantation and seemingly has no scruples whatsoever. He's probably the best character in the movie with the exception of Schultz. It's always good to see Samuel L. Jackson working with Tarantino, and his performance as Stephen was strong. He plays a complicated character who is difficult to like.

Despite all the familiar elements, Django Unchained often struggles to reach the level of Tarantino's best movies. Tarantino is a master at selecting the right music for a particular scene, but he misses the mark this time. There's nothing to match Bang Bang (Kill Bill), Across 110th Street (Jackie Brown), Cat People (Inglourious Basterds), Stuck in the Middle (Reservoir Dogs), or Dick Dale's Misirlou (Pulp Fiction). I can't think of any meaningful music from Django Unchained, despite the inevitable inclusion of something from Ennio Morricone.

I don't have a thorough understanding of the role of an editor, but I have to wonder how much the absence of Sally Menke hurt the movie. It's the first time Tarantino has made a movie without her, and at 165 minutes, Django Unchained is his longest to date. Would Menke have turned it into a more cohesive story?

I cared about Butch Coolidge, Jackie Brown, The Bride, and Shosanna Dreyfus, but I was never really invested in Django's quest to find his wife. Perhaps it would have worked better if I had been shown something of their history together?

Do you remember the opening scene from Inglourious Basterds in which Hans Landa talks to a French farmer? That's one of the best scenes that Tarantino has ever written and it works because he builds tension throughout. In Django Unchained, the tension is less intense and some of the scenes feel rushed and end prematurely. This is especially true in a scene with DiCaprio, Foxx and Waltz near the end of the movie. In fact, the ending as a whole seems entirely too predictable for something penned by Tarantino.

Tarantino is still playful, clever, creative, funny, and unpredictable, for the most part, but something is slightly off this time. I would say that Django Unchained is his second-weakest film behind Death Proof, but it still might end up as my favorite from 2012 when I have seen it a few times. If you are a Tarantino fan, it's a must-see and an eventual must-own, but it's a bit of a mess if I am honest.

5261222,5,B00947NAHU,"I admit that I was at first reluctant to watch ""Django Unchained"" because I was unsure if I was going to be able to handle all of the movie scenes. However, I instantly changed my mind when one of my younger sisters treated me to the film on Christmas day.  The film was better than I imagined and includes some of the following characters pivotal to the plot: Kerry Washington as the emotionally tough slave Brumhilda, meanwhile Jamie Foxx and Christopher Waltz brilliantly play a strong tag team via the roles of Django and Dr. King Schulz.  Leonardo Dicaprio plays a wealthy plantation owner by the name of Calvin Candie while Samuel Jackson plays his crafty assistant Stephen. Dicaprio and Jackson play evil men, but in all fairness, both men also performed their roles in a superb fashion. Quentin Tarantino also makes an appearance in ""Django Unchained."" ""Django Unchained"" is a good movie for those who like unconventional western films.",1356739200,4,944,4.89375
5261223,5,B00947NAHU,"Django was unchained, but Samuel L. Jackson was ""off the chain."" It is very easy to see why Samuel L. Jackson is one of the hardest working actors in the industry. He delivers every time. Mr. Jackson played the role of Stephen; Calvin Candie's trusted house slave, and took the ""Uncle Tom"" character to a whole new level in this movie. In fact, he may have stolen the show. I literally held my stomach and laughed out loud several times while watching Django. And, I wasn't the only one who was nearly falling out of the chair with laughter. There were so many funny scenes in this movie. Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) bounty hunting techniques; the conversation between Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) regarding Django (Jamie Fox) being allowed to stay in the big house; the hooded head ""wardrobe malfunction"" with Big Daddy (Don Johnson) and his crew; and Broomhilda's (Kerri Washington) ability to empty a glass of water while fainting were just a few of the many funny scenes in this movie.

The entire cast was outstanding. Kudos to the cast for taking on a sensitive subject matter such as slavery and creating a movie that was poignant, thought provoking, dramatic, and hilariously funny.  In fact, I am not sure what genre this movie actually falls under. Although there were some gruesome scenes in the movie; that were difficult to watch, they do reflect many of the African American experiences during (and after) slavery. Only Quentin Tarantino could come up with such a poignant, yet hilariously funny movie.",1356739200,5,1555,4.908745247148289
