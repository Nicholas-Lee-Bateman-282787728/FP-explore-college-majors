8485114,1,B005SHMLJI,"This thing is hilarious. Whether you think Milton ""Free to Choose"" Friedman was the lowest form of reptilian a**hole, or just a dried-up, hate-filled miser in a jackal-eat-jackal world, don't look here for anything remotely like an objective, intelligent take on his world-view or theories, or the current state of world economics.

This is basically an extended Lexus/American Express/Merrill Lynch commercial with a few after-thought, sound-bite ""interviews"" with 20-somethings mindlessly spouting the Chicken-Little mantra about the demise of America's Social Security system that was being pushed by the investment sector during its attack on the American middle class in the early 2000's.

If you enjoy watching pampered, trust-fund Euro-trash 30-somethings pontificate on the perils of government activity that doesn't exclusively benefit their class, to the detriment of the other 99% of the world, while being served glass after glass of wine by fawning waiters in a frou-frou ""upscale"" restaurant setting, then this is for you.",1417305600,,1036,5.67741935483871
8485115,5,B005SHMLJI,This video should be seen by everyone who wants to know how the economy of the world works.  It is suitable for young and well as old and really tells it how it is without being preachy.  We've shared this video and everyone has quite appreciated the opportunity of watching it.  Definitely recommend it.,1370476800,,304,4.592592592592593
8485116,5,B005SHMLJI,"This is a well-done documentary that reinforces important economic truths.  It would a great basis for a group discussion, particularly if the participants have varying views.",1342396800,2,175,5.730769230769231
8485117,5,B005SHMLJI,"This is an excellent look back, 30 years on, at Milton Friedman's great documentary, 'Free to Choose.' In it host and narrator, Johan Norberg of The Cato Institute includes special focus on the incompatibility with freedom that results from spinning the spirit of the U.S. Declaration of Independence embodied in the words ""men are created equal"" into the notion that government ought to try to create equality among men. I only logged in to Amazon to place the DVD in my cart after thoroughly enjoying an airing of the 1-hour show tonight by a local PBS station, and I decided to post a quick review. Bottom line is, I loved it. I found it positively inspiring.",1339372800,2,662,4.7155172413793105
8485118,5,B005SHMLJI,"This is a nice revisit of Milton Friedman's ""Free To Choose."" Johan Norberg narrated the video. What I like about this video is that Johan took on the reason why some people want ""equality of opportunity"" and some want ""equality of outcome."" Johan added his viewpoint when talking about his home country, Sweden, to show the ""equality of outcome"" side.

However, my suggestion for Free To Choose Media is to go deeper and revisit each of ""Free To Choose"" episode (Inflation, Who Protect Worker, etc.).",1329436800,,501,4.894117647058824
8485119,5,B005SHMLJI,"This is an update on Friedman's award-winning ""Free to Choose"" series<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Free-To-Choose-The-Updated-and-Revised-Television-Series/dp/B001DEH9G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Free To Choose: The Updated and Revised Television Series</a>, by the same producer who convinced Friedman to do that series 30 years ago.  It includes chunks of the original, followed by host Norberg following in Friedman's footsteps and talking to some of the same people now.  But it is not just a rehash of the original; it also adds some interesting new material concerning MF's influences on Chile and China, as well as a critical look at Sweden's choices regarding government involvement.

This is definitely done from a ""pro free market"" perspective; you need to understand that going in.  But it is a very interesting, globe-trotting look at some of the key issues in the ""larger vs. smaller government"" debate that is going on in this country, without all the shrillness. And it provides some very strong arguments in favor of individual choice. As an Economics professor, I'm happy to recommend this video to those who want to hear logical arguments based both on sound theory and on facts taken from the experiences of people and countries around the world.

Another reviewer suggested watching the original ""Free to Choose"" series, and I recommend that too, certainly.  But for those who don't have the 10 hours to spend, this one-hour video will give you the core ideas...and just may whet your appetite to watch the original.

Folks who like this might want to check out other videos by the Free to Choose Network.  And they also have the original ""Free to Choose"" videos online there; you can watch them for free.  (""Free to Watch""?)",1321142400,6,1786,5.442028985507246
8485120,1,B005SHMLJI,"This was played last night on my local PBS station.

What it was described as was a look at Milton Friedman's beliefs after the 2008 financial crisis.

What it actually is a fanboy rehash of Friedman's Free to Choose series with a cute Swedish guy trying to sell you on Friedman's role as the engineer of freedom across the galaxy by the Free to Choose Media group.

This guy was so gushing about Friedman I was ready to buy him a poster as well as a stuffed unicorn and a pink cell phone.

Whether or not you agree with Friedman, he is one of the most influential economists of the 20th century and Free to Choose (which btw ran on PUBLIC TELEVISION, not commercial) was very important. He deserves a serious look at his works and its effects both good and bad especially after the 2008 crisis where pretty much all of the major players were Friedman disciples.

This is not this work.

If you're interested in Friedman, get the Free to Choose series. If you're looking for a serious take on his works 30 years later, you'll have to wait for it.

A real disservice to a serious economist.",1320364800,2,1089,4.415
