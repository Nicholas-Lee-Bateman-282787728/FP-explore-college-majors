574195,4,6303126723,"Nothing like the original Cisco Kid tv series back in the 1950's, but an enjoyable farce. I did enjoy it, but the original with Duncan Reynaldo & Leo Carillo is 1000 times better",1388448000,,178,4.424242424242424
574196,5,6303126723,"I loved this movie and it's depiction of The Cisco Kid, but could never find it on DVD.  I was so glad when it finally became available.for my collection.",1384041600,3,154,4.310344827586207
574197,1,6303126723,"For $20, I was not expecting this to be a DVD copy. The picture quality was too dark. I thought I was buying a NEW Dvd",1361059200,,118,3.576923076923077
574198,1,6303126723,"Hey, I bought this because as a collector it was the only CISCO KID sound feature I didn't have in my video library. I like Smits as an actor and a good friend story-boarded the first 25 minutes of the film. As CISCO it just doesn't work for me. Why do film makers insist on reinventing everything?! As a film, the first 25 minutes are good, but that's no reason to recommend this CISCO to anyone. When Laser discs were the way to collect films, I had it. When I got rid of Laser when DVD took over, I always figured it would be released in this format sooner or later. Nope...never happened. So, I acquired a VHS copy from one of Amazon's ""partners"" and burnt it to DVD for my archives. It was an excellent copy of an ordinary and ultimately disappointing made for TV feature. What can I say. Loved the price and dealer service but can only ""sell"" the movie to die hard collectors. 'Nuff said.",1335484800,4,894,4.295857988165681

7839285,5,6303126723,"Luis Valdez's version of the Cisco Kid is set during Mexico's war of resistance against French intervention. It is colorful, fun, and elegant, a throwback to the old romantic films made by Gilbert Roland and Cesar Romero. Both Jimmy Smits and Cheech Marin are very good in their roles.",1503792000,,285,4.836734693877551
