8508550,3,B0071POG1Q,another good quality dvd but an appalling film ..... not even the great Frederick Stafford can save this one .,1378339200,,110,4.55
8508551,1,B0071POG1Q,"i don't know how many versions of this movie are floating around.  i know there is Synapse version which is short, this version and a japanese uncut version and maybe a few others.  this version is full-screen taken from a bad print.  the color is off and even at 91 minutes, it's edited.  oddly enough, there is a wide-screen, unedited 99 minute version in a boxed set called ""nightmare worlds.""  the movie itself is an italian flick from 1976, and if you're into italian horror movies, you know what you're in for.  bad acting, bad dialogue, nice scenery and ample nudity with good-looking actresses.  anyway, if you're interested in this werewolf movie, skip this version and go for the ""nighmare worlds"" compilation.  there is no comparison to the quality difference.",1356652800,,771,4.876923076923077
