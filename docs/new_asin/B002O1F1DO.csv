8375887,5,B002O1F1DO,"A must for my friend's wedding gift. The first one went over great in a gift basket earlier this month! It seems to be the perfect gift for either hard to shop for geeks or anybody who needs their mind expanded! So many great things to think about. This was one of the best episodes of The Universe. (I will have one when people start living on the moon or some other planet).

This is the show that opened the conversation of ""Sex on Planet Earth"" and beyond as a good thing, of its nature, (instead of degrading it). Sex in Space got me and millions of people thinking about Earth's place in a much bigger universe ... and I will go anywhere in a 2Suit (yes it even has Vanna Bonta flying in zero gravity -- she brought the stars and heavens right to my heart, made the cosmos real).

The CGI is awesome. The DVD is BluRay and the HD is great. This episode has the right mix of science and humanity.",1308700800,2,901,4.172413793103448
