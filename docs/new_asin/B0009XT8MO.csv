2334920,5,B0009XT8MO,"You may or may not have known about the old, old TV series Lights Out, but it is a series for people who take to heart the Night Gallery and Twilight Zone series. But Lights Out was much older, and it can be more compared with Night Gallery than the Twilight Zone. I read somewhere that it was actually based on a radio show and when it was converted into a TV series during a time when not too many Americans had TVs in their homes, a total of 156 episodes were broadcasted to an unwary audience and much of it was lost. The portion which is not lost did play on the Sci-Fi channel for a while, but I would really, really appreciate it if someone out there brought this creative, moody and atmospheric TV series to a DVD format for devoted collectors like me. Thank you.

Two episodes from Lights Out was included in this multi feature DVD titl, ""Lights Out and Other Supernatural Tales.""",1136073600,16,889,4.323353293413174

8069834,5,B0009XT8MO,great old series BUT it had 4 Seasons with 160 episodes.  with the 8 volumes released at 4 episodes per volume it will take quite sometime to collect all the series.  that said........enjoy what we can get. always up to the mercy of whoever is producing the series on DVD.,1430697600,3,272,4.42
8069835,5,B0009XT8MO,"These shows were done before Twilight Zone,and Outer Limits,its so much fun to watch these,and see how the shows that came later grew into what they were,and they have a lot of good stories,you might watch Sci fi Theatre as well.",1387929600,4,229,4.609756097560975
8069836,3,B0009XT8MO,"I was browsing through Youtube when I came across an obscure show titled ""Lights Out"" and I quite enjoyed some of the episodes so when I saw this DVD being offered at such a low price, I decided to purchase it. Originally, ""Lights Out"" was a popular radio program which focused on stories of the supernatural and eventually the series was adapted for television.

This DVD contains two episodes from ""Lights Out"" (1949), two episodes from another iconic TV series titled ""The Veil"" (1958), and finally, an episode from another show, ""Witchcraft"" (1961). The latter two shows were short-lived but I must confess I thought ""The Veil"" was interesting, and I loved Boris Karloff's introductions, and one of the reasons I purchased this DVD is because it contains an intriguing episode from ""The Veil"" titled Jack the Ripper. Here is the episode listing for this DVD:

From ""Lights Out"":
The Passage Beyond
The Man with the Watch

From ""The Veil"":
Jack the Ripper
The Return of Madame Vernoy

From ""Witchcraft"":
The Doll in Brambles

The total running time is 2 hours and 16 minutes, audio is in English, and the aspect ratio is 1.33. For the price, it is certainly a steal for fans of vintage horror.",1369094400,4,1196,4.758454106280193

8069839,3,B0009XT8MO,"In its earliest days, television was considered to be radio with pictures, and many of the first tv shows were adapted from popular radio shows of the day.  Like those radio shows, tv programs were mostly live performances.  Visionaries like Desi Arnez produced all his shows on film thus preserving quality archives for posterity, but the live broadcasts were lost in the wind unless someone happened to film the show by setting up a camera in front of the monitor screen.  This was called a kinescope and was of poor quality as one would expect.  The microphone was leaned against the tv speaker and a bit of the picture was lost in assuring that the monitor itself was not in the frame.  Lights Out was a very popular show on radio from 1934-1947. Each week it told of tales of horror or strangeness.  In 1946 NBC TV aired four episodes of Lights Out in four specials that were well received by critics. They began broadcast of the show as a regular weekly series on 7/19/1949 with episode #005 'Edna Warren'.  The last episode was #160 'The Hollow Man' 9/29/1952.
There are only a few episodes known to have been preserved via kinescopes and 14 of these are presented in four Alpha Video volumes.

  In Lights Out, volume one, Alpha Video includes only two episodes, #096 and #103  (the other twelve episodes are on volumes 2-4).  To round out the disk there are two episodes of The Veil and a pilot for Witchcraft.  The Veil (1958)  Was an excellent and stylish series produced by Hal Roach Studios, hosted by and starring Boris Karloff.  It told true stories of the supernatural along the lines of One Step Beyond.  There were ten episodes filmed and presented to the studios but unfortunately no one bought it, and its sale is reputed to have been the only thing that would have saved Hal Roach Studios from bankruptcy.  Image Entertainment presents all ten episodes of The Veil crisp and sharp in a two disk set. Witchcraft (1961) is an obscure black and white TV pilot narrated by Franchot Tone for an unproduced spooky/horror series.  Neither Witchcraft nor The Veil were picked up probably because public interest was shifting away from ghosts and witches that were so popular in the 1950's and turning toward science fiction or fantastic horror in the 1960's with shows like The Twilight Zone or later, Boris Karloff's Thriller.",1218412800,11,2758,4.782700421940929
8069840,1,B0009XT8MO,"I got the movie...very excited...then I put it in the DVD player and it was Jack Benny,  I contacted Amazon...they didn't seem concerned, told me to buy and pay for a new one!!! and then send it back at my expense and they would then probably refund me!  I wrote back and said I was concerned that the other ones would also be Jack Benny and have they checked the dvd's??  They have NEVER replied.  I order a lot from Amazon and am sorely disappointed in their lack of customer service/interest...",1168473600,15,497,4.428571428571429
