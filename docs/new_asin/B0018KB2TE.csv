3417606,5,B0018KB2TE,"This well-done classic 1932 whodunit is a gem.  From the beginning you know that Jenny Wren will be murdered.  She loves men - rich men.  They have taken care of her, affording her a luxurious life style - a mutually agreed arrangement, but while courting another man back east, unexpected tragedy strikes causing her to reevaluate her life.

She decides it is time to get out of the game and cash in her chips.  She confronts four of her rich men after a dinner party with her demands, assuring them she will not reveal their dirty little secrets, as long as they pay.  But before the stormy night is over, her confidence is shaken when she sees a phantom face. . . .

3417607,5,B0018KB2TE,"Sex ... Murder ... Horror ... Mystery ... Perversion.  ""The Phantom of Crestwood"" is a pre-Code gem that blends all these ingredients and more into a rich, savory stew that has steadily developed a small but very enthusiastic cult following.

Jenny Wren, a hard-hearted serial adulteress, has recently driven a young man to suicide. Now she is pressuring one of her wealthy ex-lovers, a man who happens to be the uncle of her own sister's fianc, into throwing her a lavish party at his family's isolated estate along the coast.  Her plan is to blackmail a quartet of past admirers into giving her enough money to ensure her comfort for the rest of her life.  Secretly followed to Crestwood by a mysterious man who's been tailing her for days, Jenny finds herself repeatedly confronted by the ghostly face of the suicide victim.  Then, in the middle of a dark and stormy night, Jenny is murdered, just before the road to Crestwood is buried in an avalanche of mud.  Suspicion will naturally fall on the man who has been shadowing Jenny; can he identify the real murderer before the police can make their way to the estate and arrest him?

If the plot sounds like a little like that of an old-fashioned serial, with every chapter ending in a cliffhanger, it's because ""The Phantom of Crestwood"" began as a radio serial without an ending.  The listening public was invited to send in solutions to the mystery as part of a contest, and then to see the motion picture and compare their endings with that of the screenwriter.  Running a brisk 77 minutes, the film's pace is brisk and exciting, and there are plenty of hidden passages, secret identities, and strange characters to maintain interest.  There's even two subtle hints of lesbianism (which was not too unusual in the pre-Code years): Jenny was planning to run away with her dour maid, Carter, whose grief over Jenny's death seems oddly exaggerated; and one of the other characters is an imperious, domineering old spinster whose father ""wanted a son and raised me as one.""

""The Phantom of Crestwood"" is superbly cast.  Karen Morley, a talented actress who was later blacklisted during the McCarthy era, gives the best performance of her career as the amoral Jenny; her body language is just as jaded and flippant as her speech.  Ricardo Cortez (who had recently played Sam Spade in the first sound production of ""The Maltese Falcon"" and who served as Greta Garbo's leading man in her first American film) scores as Jenny's mysterious stalker, and there's a nice early performance by future Warner Brothers star Anita Louise as Jenny's younger sister.  Several silent stars - including Aileen Pringle, H. B. Warner, and Pauline Frederick - impress in key supporting roles, and rising stars and character actors like Mary Duncan, Gavin Gordon, George E. Stone, Sam Hardy, and Richard ""Skeets"" Gallagher also stand out.

Among the crew, J. Walter Ruben's able direction is right on the money, both in intimate scenes and those involving large numbers of actors and bit players, and Max Steiner contributes a typically fine musical score.  Special mention must be made of Henry Gerrard's remarkable cinematography: there are several flashback scenes, in which the camera draws away from the present action and spins around crazily before stopping and then moving into scenes which took place in the past.  This clever framing device adds much to the dramatic atmosphere of the film.

I've been a particular fan of ""The Phantom of Crestwood"" since I first saw it late one night on TNT more than 30 years ago.  I own the laserdisc and recently added the Warner Archives DVD to my library.  I was hoping that some restoration might have been done on the video master for the DVD, but it appears that didn't happen.  Overall, the picture and sound are adequate; the occasional little flaws in the picture don't detract significantly from the movie's many pleasures.  There are no extras included.  I'm just grateful to have this film available on DVD, and I'm pleased to be able to recommend it to you.",1361664000,15,4050,4.854651162790698
3417608,4,B0018KB2TE,I love this type of 30s/40s haunted-creepy-house mystery. Good cast fun story with all the hoped for and expected ingredients. Exceent quality and packaging. This one stays in my collection.,1356825600,9,190,5.366666666666666
3417609,4,B0018KB2TE,"If you're not a huge Karen Morley fan you will be at the end of this juicy pre-code old dark house thriller. Morley's a high-class femme fatale who lures all her blackmailed clients to a sugar daddy's house for a big final shake down before she disappears out of the country - naturally things don't go well. Meanwhile Ricardo Cortez and his gang show up, and Cortez needs to solve her murder or take the blame. Lots of twists and turns and a final shot that prefigures Casablanca!! Too bad about the slightly squeezed image, but still worth it for Morley, the atmospheric camera work (including unusual whiplash flashbacks), fog-enshrouded cliff-side climaxes, secret panels, poison darts, you know... the works!.",1355788800,7,714,4.958333333333333
3417610,5,B0018KB2TE,"I REMEMBERED THIS FILM FROM MY TEEN YEARS.  IT WOULD OFTEN BE SHOWCASED ON OUR LOCAL MICHIGAN CREATURE FEATURE WEEKEND.  I KNEW NOTHING OF THE STARS OR PRODUCERS THEN.  I WAS ALWAYS STRUCK BY THE WAY THINGS WERE PRESENTED TO THE VIEWER.  I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY,, BUT THE WAY A BOYFRIEND DECIDES TO END THE RELATIONSHIP, WELL, THE MEMORY OF IT STAYED WITH ME ALL THESE YEARS. I ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE NAME OF THE MOVIE, AS BACK THEN ONE COULD NOT FREEZE FRAME, OR REPEAT, AND THE COMERCIALS WERE SO LONG.  HONESTLY, THE PACKET GIVES AWAY TOO MUCH.  WHO KILLED JENNY WREN. {AND A WREN IS A LITTLE, OBNOXIOUS BIRD}. THIS UNIQUE MASTER OF CEREMONIES,,, TRIES TO EXPLAIN HOW A RADIO IDEA, IS NOW BEING BROUGHT TO PICTURES.  AFTER-ALL... MOST PEOPLE KNEW THE STORY.  THE FLASH FORWARD OR BACK, DEPENDING?  IS SO UNEXPECTED, AND SO ENJOYED.
  AS A TEEN THIS WAS SPOOKEY.  I LOVED SECRET PASSAGES, INTO, OUT OF WALLS.  SPOOKEY OLD HOUSES WERE MADE FOR A FILM PLOT. PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE ""COLOR"" OF BLACK AND WHITE.  JENNY IS SO OVER BLOND,,, AND SHE KEEPS BRUSHING IT,, A NICE IRRITATING TOUCH.  KAREN MORELY IN THE OPENING SCENES, IS AWSOME IN THE OUTFIT, AND THE WAY SHE CARRIES IT.  WATCH JEAN HARLOW, A YEAR LATER IN ""DINNER AT EIGHT"", OBSERVE THE SAUNTERING WALK.  MORLEY IS SPECTACULAR IN THAT OPENING SCENE IN THE BANK, LATER, ONE CAN SEE SHE IS WEARING NO BRA.
  I MUST MENTION ALL THE CREEPY PEOPLE IN THE FILM.  NASTY WIVES.  WIERD MEN.  THE MEN SEEM AT TIMES TO BE ACTING AS THROUGH A GELLATIN MOLD SETTING UP QUICK.  WHEN THE MEN START TO TALK, TO EXPLAIN, ETC. FOR ME?????? GIVE HER THE MONEY, OR GO TO YOUR ROOM.  WHO CARES?  NO SYMPATHY TO THE MEN.  THE WIVES OF SAME ARE HARDLY A BREATH OF AIR.  SPOOKEY LADIES ALL.
  NOT A B. MOVIE.  SELZNICK?  ONE CAN SEE THE MASTER TO COME.  THIS IS A GOOD FILM,,,TIGHT IN ITS PACING AND TONE.  WOULD THAT, COULD THAT: SELZNICK HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND THIS TOUCH OF MIRTH IN SOME OF HIS HEAVEN OVER AND OVER DONE FILMS.  THE WESTERN HE DID AND RE DID,,,AND RE EDITED, OVER AND OVER,,, WITH JENNIFFER JONES,,, SEE I CAN NOT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE MOVIE, LILLIAN GISH CAME OUT OF RETIREMENT TO PLAY A PART IN THE FILM,,,,""DUELL IN THE SUN"" AND I THINK?  1947?? SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED ""SCHUCKS??""  AT THE BOX OFFICE IT DIED.  THE FILM HE DID WITH ROCK HUDSON AND WITH JENNIFER ,,,,, THE HEMINGWAY RE-MAKE, AGAIN I CAN NOT REMEMBER OH! ""A FAREWELL TO ARMS"".  I WAS A LITTLE BOY ON VACATION WITH MY PARENTS AND WE WENT TO SEE ""A FAREWELL,, ETC... HUDSON HAD BLUE HAIR, AND JENNIFER WAS SUFFERING ,,,,, A BOY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND,,, ANYMORE THAN AN ADULT.  THE WORLD LOVED HEMINGWAY.  I DON'T KNOW WHY.  EVERYONE WAS SUFFERING ,,, IF THEY LIVED?  IMPOTENT. SUICIDE.
  I SHOWED ""PHANTOM OF CRESTWOOD TO MY 5TH GRADE STUDENTS, AND SOME SEEMED TO FALL ASLEEP, BUT! NOT ALL.  SOME STAYED BEHIND AND ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FILM.  WHY WAS JENNY THAT WAY.  WHY DID SHE HAVE TO DIE.  WHY WAS SHE SHUT-OUT BY THE OTHER PEOPLE. MY POINT IS: THIS IS NOT A, ""B."" MOVIE.  AS WITH ALL ART; LOOK AT IT AND DECIDE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.
  THE MIRACLE? THAT IT SURVIVES TO BE SEEN AND CHERISHED BY ALL.  THAT IS WHY THEY CALL IT ART.  SOMEONE WILL SEE THIS FILM AND BE FOREVER HAUNTED BY CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE STORY.  THE ADIRRONDACK SCENE, DONE ALMOST AS;  SOMEONE READING A TELEPHONE BOOK. SO UNDERPLAYED, UNEXPECTED, SO YOUNG AND FOOLISH.  TODAY WE HAVE TELEVISION SHOWS ABOUT MISSING PEOPLE AS ENTERTAINMENT, NOT AS TRAGEDY.  THIS FILM HAS A CERTAIN INNOCENCE ABOUT IT.  YET THE ACTORS ARE ALWAYS THERE!  BELIEVING IN WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  AFTER IT IS OVER ,,,, NO WAIT,, LET THE VIEWER DECIDE.  ........  FOR ME?  GET THE POPCORN, BRING THE NEICES AND NEPHEWS........OOOPS THE ROAD HOME JUST GOT WASHED AWAY.  COOL.",1337904000,12,3769,4.45
3417611,5,B0018KB2TE,"""You don't believe in ghosts do ya?""

""No, but I'm afraid of 'em!""

This fun little ""B"" mystery made by RKO in the early 1930's had a deliberate tie-in with radio and enough talent behind and in front of the camera to make it a late night gem when viewed today. Looking to secure a built in audience for the mystery, someone came up with the nifty idea of finishing off a radio show at the movies. NBC broadcast The Phantom for six weeks, but listeners didn't get to hear the conclusion. A contest with many prizes encouraged fans to submit their own ending to the mystery. Winners didn't have to come close to the film's solution to win, it was simply a gimmick to get people into theaters, which it did, to the tune of more than $100,00 in profits for RKO. Former silent star Ricardo Cortez had the male lead, with Karen Morley and Anita Louise brightening the proceedings quite nicely.

Writer Bartlett Cormack and director J. Walter Ruben didn't really offer anything new, but a young David O. Selznick and Merian C. Cooper gave it a polished look, and the attractive cast did the rest. While it doesn't have machine gun pizazz, the ""B"" mystery is told with a touch of ""A"" class by all involved, and it's a lot of fun. Morley was borrowed from MGM for an added dash of elegance, but Anita Louise is equally chic and even more adorable in her role as Morley's daughter. The story begins on radio, with the announcer talking about the contest, and inviting listeners to now watch along, as the mystery of who killed the two people is finally solved. What follows has that same sense of fun old mystery shows from radio had, so fans of that medium will no doubt enjoy this one. The two people who had already been murdered on radio are named, but I will not mention them here in case viewers want to turn the sound down during the first two minutes of the announcement portion, which comes immediately, and watch the entire mystery. It doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film if you know, however.

Jenny Wren (Karen Morley) has been living off her favors for too long, and when one of her admirers takes it all too seriously, and commits suicide, she decides to get out. She coerces four of them to meet her at a ranch party so she can extort money from each and sail out at high tide, leaving her old life behind. Her lovely daughter Esther (Anita Louise) is engaged to the son of one of these men and they come along. Also present is Jenny's faithful maid, Carter (Hilda Vaughn). Following Jenny for an unknown reason is Gary Curtis (Ricardo Cortez). It isn't long, of course, before someone gets a dart to the neck--yeah, you read correctly. Afraid it will be pinned on him, Curtis and his gang attempt to solve it before the police can make it through the storm and get the chance. Power outages, a secret passageway from the cliffs by the sea to the house, a dead man's pin, a death mask, and another murder, not to mention an attempted one, keep viewers entertained. It seems much better onscreen than it does on paper, thanks to a polished production.

Pauline Frederick, H.B. Warner, Mary Duncan, Sam Hardy, and Tom Douglas join Cortez, Morley, and Louise for what is a very fun ""B"" mystery with an added interest for old radio fans to enjoy. This is available in Australia on region four, but is worth tracking down a copy in any form for ""B"" mystery fans, especially those who are also in love with old radio. Great late at night, with a big bowl of popcorn.",1278979200,12,3479,4.455259026687598
3417612,5,B0018KB2TE,"Very good early 30's creepy mansion murder mystery.  A professional 'other woman' decides to blackmail a group of her former paramours, but another sin from her past follows her and she is murdered.  Who did it?  A professional thief, who came to rob the mansion where all the suspects are gathered decides to solve the murder before it is pinned on him and his crew.  Atmospheric and, for the era, very polished and well done with good performances.  The Warner Archives DVD-R release is very good quality.  Highly recommended.",1434758400,,528,4.876404494382022

3417620,5,B0018KB2TE,I enjoy the old films as the plots are interesting and I don't have to have bad language or raw sex scenes to enjoy the plot.  Also the don't all look alike.
