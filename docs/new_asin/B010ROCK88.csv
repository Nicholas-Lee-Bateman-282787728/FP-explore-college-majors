7316340,5,B010ROCK88,"I saw this movie for the first time a few nights ago and it is terrific! One of the most underrated movies ever made. Everything about it was pure class......especially its style. Excellent soundtrack also. This is one of Nicolas Cage's best performances who has always been an excellent and misunderstood actor and the equally great and underrated Sam Rockwell is just as good. The real surprise is newcomer Alison Lohivan who rounds out this incredible trio of characters. This really is a flat out fantastic film. If you like Ocean`s Eleven and Catch me if you can, this will be another movie you`ll love. Buy it!",1447113600,2,616,4.766355140186916

I had it on DVD but wanted this on Blu-ray, because I'm watching it on a 7 foot diagonal screen at ten feet away. I can honestly see how a couple of Cage's cons in this could work, and I am hard to fool that way! Very believable in that respect.",1508630400,,315,3.921875
