8056480,3,B000922EN0,"this would be quite a collection of avant-garde animation if the cartoons listed on the back cover were actually contained on the DVD. Besides the title cartoon (which is the My Favorite Fairy Tales version and is accurately represented on the label), the titles given are: The 51st Dragon (Gerald McBoing-Boing), Children of the Sun (1961 John & Faith Hubley), Moonbird (1959 John & Faith Hubley), Phenomena (??), A Short Vision (1956 BFI), Pleased to Eat You (a Novetoon and the only one that is really on the DVD), and Marcello, I'm So Bored (1966 John Milius). Can you imagine finding all these rare gems on a dollar DVD? Moonbird is even pictured on the back label but not contained on the disk.
I don't know what happened but what's actually here are the usual shorts you'd find, mostly Fleischer. Ants in the Plants, Bunny Mooning, Cobweb Hotel, Fire Cheese (Gabby), Play Safe, Pleased to Eat You (black & white), and Boy Meets Dog (Walter Lantz). These are good cartoons to have if you don't already and probably better for small children to view. But what deceptive labeling. Like this list is the template at Digiview Productions and they forgot to finish overwriting before it went to print. LOL
Anyway, I'm glad to have this sort of strange 9 minute version of The Wizard of Oz on DVD. On VHS, it was released in SLP mode and this is an improvement.",1442793600,,1361,4.651452282157677
8056481,3,B000922EN0,"Don't be fooled by this cover.  This is not a cartoon with the likenesses of the '39 version.  A very short sort of anime looking version of The Wizard of Oz.  Not bad I guess, but not great by any means.  However, the rest of the content is quite nice.  Nothing to do with The Wizard of Oz, but nice vintage cartoons.  2 Little Audrey toons, 2 Betty Boop toons, 2 Raggedy Ann toons and a Walt Disney toon called Susie the Little Blue Coupe.
So just be warned that the cover doesn't match the content.",1256342400,,501,4.166666666666667
8056482,5,B000922EN0,Purchased for my daughter who loves anything related to Wizard of Oz and she truly enjoyed this cartoon version ..,1195257600,,114,4.75
8056483,1,B000922EN0,"Except for the first cartoon, The Wizard Of Oz, the rest of these are classic Max Fleischer Color Classic Cartoons.  But instead of buying this cheap un-restored disc, I would steer you to VCI's ""DANCING ON THE MOON"" DVD which features almost every Max Fleischer Color Classic Cartoon in restored prints (some from 35mm).",1148860800,2,321,4.944444444444445
