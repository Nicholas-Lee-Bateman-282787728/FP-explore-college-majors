8568387,4,B00BH417PA,Better than average western takes place in Canada.  Indians treated better than in other westerns.  Still pretty dated though with Caucasians playing Indians and not always well.  Very young Rita Moreno is very pretty in a limited role.,1424822400,,236,5.157894736842105

8568389,4,B00BH417PA,"If you love the old Western plot and style this will be one for your collection. The action, love, landscape are well worth the view!",1395964800,,133,4.36
8568390,5,B00BH417PA,"A good western both the leading actor's who are brothers after one of the brother's
get's into a gunfight they both cross into Canada an join the North West Mounted Police
And help into trying to stop the Sioux from going to war against the white settlers.
This movie is in colour plenty of action well worth watching it only goes for 75mins but still
enyoyable.",1388448000,,362,4.5
8568391,4,B00BH417PA,This was good western movie about the northwest mounted police of canada. The actors performances were good and I would recommend it to western fans.,1371513600,3,149,5.0
8568392,5,B00BH417PA,"This a personal 5 stars, if that makes sense!. One of my favourite films as a young boy, and not seen for many years, this doesn.t let me down. An action packed ""Western"" set among the Mounties with James Craig as ""good"" brother outlaw and Keith Larsen as ""bad"" brother worse outlaw, escaping from law back in the U.S.A. The rest of the cast are not that remarkable but Morris Ankrum is fine and unbilled Riley Hill is there too. The print is fine but the original colour was never that good anyway, so this is the best we will get (and it is perfectly watchable). So, recomended to all western fans, and if you have never seen it you should be in for a pleasurable view. Good luck (Shame about the price, but nobody twisted my arm!!)",1366502400,6,734,4.326086956521739
8568393,5,B00BH417PA,"Two brothers escapes a posse and head into Canada, While taking a break two Indians appear one of the brothers shoots one
and kills him. They both join the Mounted Police, in the meantime one of the brothers turns bad. Very good  and rare, action and colour. Stars James Craig, and young Rita Moreno. On time delivery from Amazon.",1364515200,4,330,4.593220338983051
