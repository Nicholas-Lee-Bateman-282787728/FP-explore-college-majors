8371121,1,B002ISQ53S,Did not like. Did not even finish watching. Description did not indicate it was a documentary. Not worth $4.99,1517184000,,110,4.842105263157895

8371124,5,B002ISQ53S,"So the play on words for the title caught me off guard for a little bit, but as the documentary progressed it was obvious the issues were CLEARCUT!  I respect the right of the Clemons Family Foundation to have changed the requirements to access funding for the full ride college tuition ticket. A friend of mine who lived near there told me many families were moving into Philomath just to gain access to the free ride.  Something was going to change one way or the other.
  I'm left wondering when most Oregonians are going to realize that it was timber that built Oregon towns, Oregon jobs, Oregon roads, and Oregon Schools, not to mention access to the National Forest System and the Great Oregon Coast. It was timber dollars that gave rise to successful men, families and charitable organizations that still support their communities to this day.  The Story of Philomath could well be the same story for Oregon City, Tillamook, Springfield, Eugene, Roseburg, Medford, Klamath Falls, Bend, Pendelton, and John Day to name a few. I am not really interested what everyone's political views are on this subject, but at least be honest about Oregon's HISTORY!
  I would highly recommend this documentary. It dealt with the issues fairly. Time well spent.",1425513600,5,1253,4.882075471698113
8371125,5,B002ISQ53S,"I grew up in Roseburg and worked in Klamath Falls and have seen first hand the pluses and minuses of the timber barons and their impact on the local logging communities.  As in the case in Philomath the first generation timber entrepreneurs, the Fords and Wendts, like the Clemens, often tried to give back to the communities.  Not so  much the second generation, who, like Lawther in this movie, grew up with a sense of entitlement.  Its hard to believe this guy actually says on camera that God guided him to deny scholarships set up by his uncle because the school board refused to fire the school superintendent when he asked them to.  This documentary is very well done.  It never screams, it never shows bias.  Both sides are presented fully and fairly and the advocates make their case in their own words.  There is no narration.  But the story is compelling and dramatic.  This is worth watching no matter where you are from or what side of the political spectrum you support.  A must see for Oregonians who grew up, like I did, in timber country.",1421280000,3,1055,4.588235294117647
8371126,5,B002ISQ53S,"A remarkable movie showing how stubborn pride plus personal resentment can tear a community apart. Peter Richardson followed this with another even more remarkable documentary,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Die-in-Oregon/dp/B005TZFZBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Die in Oregon</a>.
