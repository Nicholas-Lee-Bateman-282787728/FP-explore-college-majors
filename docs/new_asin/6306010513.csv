1109281,2,6306010513,"Snow day is an OK movie. But adults may find it a bit boring. It is by the way a nickelodeon movie, so it aims at younger viewers. Despite it is only 89 mins, 84 mins for the features and 5 minutes for the credit, the movie feels a bit long. Not enough Chevy Chase, so the funny moments are limited as well. The younger actors' give excellent performances. The DVD's picture quality is OK and the 5.1 Dolby Digital has very limited activities. It worths to be watched once not to keep. Just rent this one.",983577600,6,505,4.216494845360825
1109282,4,6306010513,"You may have been looking at all of the reviews for this movie and getting mixed messages.  First of all, it is a story about a group of kids trying to seek revenge because of the ""Snow Plow Man"" who has ruined every first snow day with no snow day to follow. (He ruined it by plowing the roads and making it so the kids could go to school after each snow day.) The older brother of one of the kids is trying to find a way to tell a popular girl that he likes her.  The plot is that simple.  The plot is not ""meshed"" it is just like any other movie, there is more than one thing going on, but it would only confuse you if you are an easily confused person (after all it was intended for a younger audience, and they get it!).  There is no harsh or ""adult"" language used in the film, to my knowledge, and I have seen it twice.  I liked the movie, and thought that it was fun, go ahead and buy it, if you have kids, or if you are just looking for a cute film with a clear message "" anything can happen, when you really try""",980121600,6,1021,3.889423076923077
1109283,2,6306010513,"This movie isn't exactly what I would call great. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, just below average.
Firstly, you can't tell who the main character is because the plots are all put together so badly you can hardly tell which is the main plot. And not many of the characters are likeable either. For example, the ""snowplow man"" is a complete jerk, and you have to dislike Hal (the older brother) in some way because he left his younger sister alone just so he could find the most popular girl in school. (whom he later rejects.)
Secondly, I really think that if this was supposed to be a kids movie, they could have cut out the cuss words in the movie...this is a kids movie, not an adult movie! Parents may have questioned taking their children to it.
Thirdly, the content of the movie itself was not done well. All the jokes the actors made were corny and old, some of the characters were played horribly, and the plots were boring and did not offer us engaging characters to really follow throughout the movie.
Overall? I think this movie could have been much better. I didn't enjoy it much, and depending on your tastes, you may or may not like this movie. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps.",978652800,,1212,4.415178571428571
1109284,2,6306010513,"Is this what we've come to accept as a good picture? Have we swallowed Hollywood's drivel so faithfully that they can pawn this off on us as a decent effort? As my caption suggests, I was literally insulted by the ""plots"" on this film.
The premise is great. I lived for snow days when I was young. And it was the premise that got me out to see it. Well, that and Chevy Chase. But Chase hasn't done a watchable film since ""Christmas Vacation"". I keep hoping he'll break whatever slump he's in, and this movie WAS better than his other recent efforts.
But the weakness of ""Snowday"" is not in the acting. I mean, the acting is not stellar by any standard, but you don't really expect it to be in this kind of film. You just want to be entertained. However, in order to entertain, a film  - ANY film, including low-ball comedies like this - must have 1) a discernible protagonist, 2) a shred of believability, and 3) likeable characters. ""Snowday"" is lacking in the above categories.
The ""protagonist"" is an adolescent boy who only wants to date the most popular girl in school. In doing so he shuns his adorable little sister and his best friends. He pursues the popular girl, and against the odds, she falls for him and even makes the move to kiss him.
Sound good? Here are a few problems. First, this popular girl is an absolute sweetheart. She's been mistreated and ignored by a jerk boyfriend for too long. You feel bad for her. You really like her. As a result, you WANT them to end up together. But of course, they don't. After the kiss, in a moment of clarity, our hero realizes that he is in love with his quite unattractive, redheaded lifelong pal. The writers made the fatal flaw in this plot line of making us LIKE the popular girl. She had no flaws and you feel bad for her, so as a result you're actually MAD at the hero when he rejects her.
Also, there are many storylines that just aren't woven together well. We're not sure who the main character is supposed to be (it doesn't seem to be the narrator - the adolescent older brother - since his story is in the background). The problem is that they did not focus enough on the ""fun"" aspect of this film, the snow day itself. They spent too much time on this kid trying to get this popular girl (whom he then rejects) and that had NOTHING to do with a snow day, other than the mantra he kept repeating, ""Anything can happen on a snow day..."" It could have been any day of the week.
I suppose kids will like it, but even kids should have the basic elements of a good story presented to them.",974246400,4,2551,4.314583333333333
1109285,5,6306010513,"When I went to see this movie, I thought I was wasting my money and my time but I was wrong. ""Snow Day"" isn't only a movie for kids, is for adults too. Starring Chevy Chase as a weatherman that one day discovers the snow is coming. His children want a snow day because they don't go to school.  But there is a problem: the snowplowman (Chris Elliott). This time the kids will get fight against the snowplowman to have more days of fun with the snow. The romantic part appears when the son of the weatherman (Mark Webber) declares to his love interest. His childhood friend (Schuyler Fisk) falls in love with him but he doesn't know it. Is a great movie for the whole family. Rent ""Snow Day"" today and you'll enjoy so much. Probably you'll buy it too. A five stars movie, with good actors and a lot of great song that make you buy the soundtrack.",974073600,,845,4.28125
1109286,4,6306010513,"This is a fun family movie to watch.  It reminded me of when I was a kid and wanted that all to needed, school is out, due to snow.  The portrayal of the sitting at the kitchen table to hear that your school is closed is brought to the screen all to well.  I rented the movie, and will buy this movie for many years of family fun.  A definte add to any family collection.  The producers of this movie (Nick-O-Lodien) pulled off a Disney frame of film that is all too good.  The DVD version off this movie has the extras that will surprise you.",973555200,,543,4.0754716981132075

This is a great winter movie to snuggle in with and watch with the whole family.",971740800,,345,4.532258064516129

1109289,1,6306010513,"This is by far the worst movie I saw all year! I really like kids movies and all of the other movies releases by Nick Studios, but this one was BAD!! It had a very stupid, uninteresting plot and characters that you don't care about what happens to them. The best thing about the movie is the single ""Another Dumb Blonde"" in the movie by Hoku. I don't understand how so many people saw this movie at theatres. Skip this one and go for Flintstones 2 or Toy Story 2 for recent GREAT kids or family movies.",971222400,,502,4.185567010309279

1109347,4,6306010513,"I thought this was a pretty entertaining movie, it isn't the greatest movie ever made, but I was never bored while watching it, don't wish I hadn't watched it, and if a movie achieves those things then I think it's worth recommending.  It does some faults, but they are overshadowed by being entertained.  Chevy Chase was a bit underutilised as the main character's dad who is also a TV weatherman, and surely they could have come up with something a bit more original than riding a sled out of control, which was done way better the first time in Christmas Vacation.  Snow Day revolves around kids getting a bonus day off of school due to heavy snow fall, we follow two storylines with the lead kid of each being siblings.  The older kid, the brother has had a crush on the older hot chick of the school (Emmanuelle Chriqui) who doesn't even know his name, and learns she has just broken up with her boyfriend.  He along with every other male kid in the town is determined to ask her out (likely because she likes to wear t-shirts in the cold with no bra so they assume if they date her they'll get some action, the actress was 25 when the film came out in 2000), but knows it's got to be done right, he's in possession of a whale ankle bracelet of hers, that he hopes to use to help him.  He has a best friend gal pal who will act as his wingman.  Meanwhile his younger sister along with her friends who had hoped he would join her, plans to stop the ""evil"" snowplowman from clearing the snow from the roads, so that tomorrow will also have to be a snowday.

These kids definitely get up to a lot of stuff that would have them face criminal charges if this was real life.  Such as vandalism, major theft, harassment of a guy just doing his job, amongst others.  The parents especially the mother of the two main characters is one of those afraid of discipline types, when her youngest kid runs outside when she's on an important call with an even more important one happening moments soon, she resorts to please come inside.  If I'd done that when I was that kids age, I would have been spoken to in a tone that left me with no uncertainty that I was in trouble and really big trouble if I didn't come back inside.  Chevy Chase's character as well, I would think the ice-sculpture stuff would get enough complaints he'd get taken off the air, and when we finally meet the object of his hatred Chad (John Schneider - Bo in Dukes of Hazard) the reason for the turning of opinion of the crowd seemed a bit weak.

I didn't really get why the principal was being constantly snowballed, they really needed something added to justify this, maybe he unfairly punished all kids for something only one kid did or something like that.  It just lacked a motivation element.

As I said though, Snow Day has it's faults which is why I didn't rate it five stars, but it still is definitely entertaining enough to watch it more than once.",1483142400,,2924,4.378927911275416

Younger kids will marvel at the freedom these kids experienced, in the age of bubble-wrapped children and helicopter parents.

This is for kids, but has a young adult or teen feel to it as well, which is confusing. Should of stayed in the kid genre, and not flipped story-lines, so much!

You see 5 pine trees (not just the two pictured on the DVD cover) and the stream running between them.  I don't care if it is a simulated scene or not as discussed in other reviews, I think it perfectly sets the mood of a wintery scene with snow constantly falling.  I really like the fact that it has both a track of natural sounds with running water/wind and a music track with new age guitar type music (no Christmas carols, so the music track is good anytime of year.)

1109553,3,6306010513,"Okay, how did Chevy Chase agree to do this film?  Why wasn't it funnier with him in it?  I think the Law and Order episode he guest-starred in was funnier than this.  Why did Zena Grey, the person we arguably see the most of, show up ninth in the cast list (at least on the film's wikipedia page)?  How much restraint did Chris Elliott have to use to keep this film kid-friendly?  All these questions remain unanswered.  But for all its faults and unanswered questions, this film can be fun to watch on...well, a snow day.  Zena Grey and her band of mischievous but determined children seek to extend an unexpected snow day by preventing the ""evil"" snow plow driver (Chris Elliott with a crow) from clearing the streets and keeping those big yellow busses from getting through.  Meanwhile, Gray's older brother and the film's narrator, a ""duel role"" played by Mark Webber, tries to get the girl of his dreams, played by Emmanuelle Chriqui, with the aide of his best friend, played by Schuyler Fisk, who is love-struck herself.  This film has some laughs, especially when Chris Elliott is at his hammiest behind the wheel of his snowplow.  Some things seem off (i.e. the principal being pelted with snowballs no matter where he is...literally), but it's a kids' movie, so I'll let stuff like that go for the most part...I do wonder why the schools closed when the snow could easily be walked through for the most part.  The only tall piles that appeared were made by the snowplow.  I'm from New York and I've gone to school in worse conditions than this.  Also, how did the kids have that, seemingly high-tech snow fort all set up and well-stocked?  The snowstorm was pretty unexpected...not a lot of time to prepare.  But in the end, if you and your kids are stuck at home during a snowstorm, go ahead and pop this DVD into your player.",1403308800,,1836,4.588957055214724

-- This Living Art video, ""Snow Day,"" is truly ambient in that the one scene (shown on back cover of box) is constant; it does not change locations or camera angles.  The scene is a pleasant one (a few evergreens backed by tall, bare deciduous trees near a babbling brook) and creates an unassuming presence.  The film loops continuously, and (thankfully) fairly smoothly.  You can choose between nature sounds or music, or a combination of the two -- options always welcomed in these types of videos.

-- The snow is digitally-generated, but is tastefully rendered, and does at least -appear- to be random as it floats down.

==================================

Miss:

-- I felt that the music (light jazz/rock/hip-hop) did not compliment the scene of snow falling at all, what with busy guitar strumming, acoustic piano hammering, and soul-less drum machine snare, handclaps, and percussion.  So I opt for the pure nature sound setting of the running brook.

==================================

This DVD is ideal if you only need a quiet visual background to set the mood for a certain room at a party.  For such settings, it works rather well, and performs the function of moving art.  The more I play it, the more I like it.  Just turn it on and let it go...  The snow keeps falling, and all's right with the world...",1229644800,4,1327,4.887892376681615

2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

Some reviewer said this was a movie for fans of The Adnventures of Pete & Pete. That's a giant LOAD!!!! The Adventures of Pete & Pete is my all time favorite show, and I recently read this movie was meant to be a Pete & Pete movie. But this film came about when Nickelodeon had lost it's mind and tried to appeal to teenage audiences. Oh sure you could say it has the elements of the show, but hardly any. The soundtrack for this movie sucks compaired to what Pete & Pete gave us. What is the deal with that song ""Another Dumb Blonde"" by Hoku? It has nothing to do with the movie whatsoever, yet they have it as the main song and it's just a terrible song. Pete & Pete was like an alternative rock show, this movie is a commercialized mess. I can't believe some actors from Pete & Pete would even participate in this. The narration is nothing like the show, for starters it's just narration, no cut to the protagonist looking at the camera. The child actors are worthless, they have none of the charms of stars Michael Maronna (Big Pete) and Danny Tamberelli (Little Pete) or any of the kid actors that appeared on the show over the seasons. Chevy Chase just needs to stop trying to make movies, he lost his funny long ago. Only blowholes like this movie. They need to make a REAL Pete & Pete movie.",1184371200,,1460,4.195729537366548

But for those of you who are big fans of the television series The Adventures of Pete and Pete, this really is a must see. This film was originally conceived and written to be a P&P motion picture, and many of the elements are still there... You just have to be a big enough fan to spot them :) Big Pete's signature narration is present through the character of Hal Brandston, and Natalie Brandston seems to be doing the job of taking on the International Adult Conspiracy (although, admittedly, she is no Little Pete). Many actors from P&P are present (Iggy Pop, Chris Elliott, and Damian Young), and some characters as well. Wayne Pardue became Wayne Alworth, and Bill Korn became... Well, Bill Korn. Gone is the signature soundtrack of bands such Polaris or Apples in Stereo, and watered down is the surrealism and trash talking (although Hal does call someone a ""blow hole"")... But if you take it like it is, you just might have a blast pointing out what has been kept in tact :)",1149206400,,1066,4.557291666666667

1109796,3,6306010513,"This movie was originaly released in 2000 but I only just got the chance to see it now, six years later. I can't believe how young Josh Peck was back then. It hasn't really been that long and he currently looks like he's ready to graduate from high school! Then again with his acting career sky-rocketing he probably should, if he hasn't already. They were also lucky enough to get (gasp!) Chevy Chase and Chris Elliott! I love Chase because of the National Lampoon's Vacation movies. The main reason I'm writing this however is because of the minds behind it. It was co-written and co-produced by Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi, the same ones responsible for The Adventures Of Pete & Pete, which would explain it's dark legend based humor (i.e. Snowplow Man, evil killer of snow days everywhere), and kids in charge/ adults left in the dust (snow?) nature. Infact I wouldn't be surprised if this started out as a planned series, perhaps The Adventures Of Hal & Nat, (they were the main characters), with ""Snow Day"" being the first episode. Which reminds me, two Pete & Pete actors returned for Snow Day. Iggy Pop (Mr. Mecklenburg) is now Mr. Zellweger the owner of the ice skating rink and Damian Young (Bus Driver Stu Benedict) is Principal Weaver, who is consantly being attacked with snowballs. I have found many other Pete & Pete overtones in Snow Day as well. How many can you find? Surprisingly I only gave this three stars while I scored Pete & Pete a perfect five. Snow Day is pretty good but not as good as I thought it would be. It's good for a deep snowy day if you want to stay inside. Grab a hot coco make yourself comfortable and enjoy. You're sure to get a good laugh. (Update 1/17/07) Here's irony for you, I just found out that this was originaly planned to be the Pete & Pete movie. I suppose this would explain the show's overtones through out the movie.",1139616000,2,1874,4.530973451327434
1109817,3,6306010513,"I saw snow day a few years ago as soon as it came out and even at that young age the movie made me say unrealistic and i mean so unrealistic that it should be titled unrealistic snow day. To me snow day was a really good movie for a good period of its running time but things hit rock bottom at a certain part. This movie follows many other predictable story lines from other teen movies before it. Its basically a guy who is a loser in school and has been in love with the most popular girl in school since grade school but there's a bump in the road that will not surprise anybody. And what is the bump you ask how about his best friend is a girl he also grew up with so i don't think i have to explain, actually if you have seen (can't hardly wait) then you have seen this except this is the kiddy version and there are too many movies like cant hardly wait so why would we want another one. Its very confusing watching this cause the popular girl is actually not evil she is very nice and this kid works hard the entire movie to get her to notice him and even better get her to fall in love with him and then sorry i don't wanna give it all away. This is a very good movie for your children to watch but most likely they'll be shouting unreal at the end cause it has a change that is common in a movie like this and trust me it wasn't needed at all it would have been a better movie without it. If you want something good from Nickelodeon then pick up some of there old classics cause this is one of their movies you can wait for to be televised. I give it 3 stars because it is very intertaining until the end.",1134086400,,1615,3.9723076923076923

You're looking for a fun family flick that can for once lay off the football-in-the-crotch jokes and less overt adult references we assume the kids don't catch.  (I for one give the little lads a little more credit.)  The movie's simple, creative, even smart, dealing with the challenges and pain of early adolescence in an honest but responsible way.

1109821,5,6306010513,"If you are wondering what the pro and con of a Snow Day are. Then here they are. The pro is you get a day off from school. The con is that you will have to go back 2 to school at the end of the year to make up for the Snow Day(s). But suppose if you worked a job (other than being a teacher or other staff member at a school), I'm not sure on how it would be worked if they had to close for a snow day to. In Snow Day there are kids, teenagers and adults who are rivals for what they want. The kids want to enjoy the snow day, but their rival is the evial snowplowman (Chris Elliot). There's a high school student named Hal (Mark Webber) who has now a new girlfreind that seems to don't know that he lives. And he has to go up against her ex-boyfriend (David Paetkau) to win her. While his dad Tom Brandson (Chevy Chase) who wants to wear pants while he does the wheather but his boss (Pam Grier) that tells him to get the rating of his rival and she will let him wear pants on the air.
My thoughts on Snow Day are, that if you like movies with people going up against rivals and enjoyed Snow Day, I reccomend you to watch Max Keeble's Big Move. Watching Chevy Chase playing a whatherman who wears costumes on air reminds me of Max Keeble's dad. Because Max's dad had to wear costumes to work at times. My Suggestions: Parents if your kids want to watch a film, I reccomend you to know what the rating is. And toi watch the film ahead of time and decide to let your kids watch a film that doesn't have a G rating (like this). Snow Day is a good movie to watch if you like movies in which characters go up against thier ""rivals"" to get what they want like this and Max Keeble's Big Move. Or if you have a kid that like Nicolden's films I also reccomend you to let your kids watch this. Or this is a good movie to watch, if you are a fan of a actor or actress that is in this film. So if it is any of the above reasons, I strongly reccomed you to watch this movie. Even if it is not a snow day.",1042070400,,1992,3.8968058968058967

Steal is fun and benifial! Steal a Snowmobile from a bully to escape! Steal a plow truck and drive through a city! THese things are fun and theres nothing wrong with them. Nothing will happen to you either! Oh, I forgot, steal peoples pets too! Lets say you want a car to stop for you. Don't call out, simply lay in the road and wait for them to stop on a nice snow packed road! Are we having fun yet? Well make sure after you steal a plow truck to naturaly get your friends to tie up the driver! Want to change a song at an ice skating rink? No problem! Decieve the owner into leaving for a second then lock him out of his own business! then your are free to change the music to what ever you want! Problem solved! Need to tell something to someone? Simple wait for a news person to have an accident and then get infront of the camera and you can talk away! this is great! Hey kids, don't like your principal at school? wait till he is not looking and throw snow balls at him for a whole day! want to watch tv in your snow fort? Go for it! electricity is fun!

One reason why i was so involved was because of the young starlet who plays the crush of one of the main characters.  She was stunning, but i did notice something that parents might want to consider:
 While at her window, this young lady is in nothing but her Pj's, which consist of a white, spaghetti string tank top...no bra underneath.

People who usually are at school or work are playing in the snow on a regular business day when all businesses are closed. Snow makes here a lot of things enjoyable. I wish it had been available in my country earlier - now I had to hurry the availability by entering an international order. And the reason why no fifth star is that international orderers should be aware that the player has to be capable of playing back enforced region 1, that means it has to be manually switchable between regions if bought at a region other than region 1. That is a bad issue and I'm in fact collecting names to object the limitation and to support the 1948 United Nations Human Rights Declaration article XIX.
