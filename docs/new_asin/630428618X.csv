7867617,5,630428618X,"Chris Rock Bring The Pain, is absoultely, most definetly the best ever stand up show ever done, and that is not a hyperbole (exageration for those not so knowledgable as I)
At the end of it you will be shouting ""GIMME SOME MORE"" as it keeps on hitting you hard with the best laughs possible, right up to the end.
Once you watch this, you will be changed for life, and will be repeating the jokes everywhere and to everyone and all the time!

7867618,5,630428618X,This is one of the best stand up acts I have ever seen. It would make Richard Pryor proud. Chris Rock uses intelligent wit and plent of punch in this awesome performance. I never thought he was so funny. When I was in the USA I watched his show a couple of times but this certainly takes the cake. He has got my respect big time!!!,997228800,,331,4.03030303030303
7867619,5,630428618X,"I have never laughed so hard in my life... I laughed so hard I thought I was going to hurt myself. Every time I watch this I laugh out loud--even when I'm alone! You know, usually, once you know the jokes, things stop being so funny, but this NEVER stops being funny. You find yourself quoting Chris Rock in certain conversations, even making the facial expressions and the accent. His intelligent, and yet hilarious commentaries are always SO relevant with what's going on in the world. Chris Rock is the new funniest man alive! See also, Bigger and Blacker (now available). It's not quite as funny as this one, but still the same...  (Warning, for those of you not familiar: he does use 4-letter words, so if that offends you, then don't watch. However, he really knows *how* to use them, so you might get an education ;o)",969580800,8,824,4.5675675675675675
7867620,5,630428618X,"Not being a fan of Chris Rock's brand of comedy, I initially watched this with an understandably less-than-enthusiastic attitude.  However, after the first few minutes, I couldn't stop laughing at his annoyingly high-pitched  and rough-sounding delivery, in addition to his raw and honest assessment  of the world we live in today.  He works the crowd like Eddie Murphy did in  the early 80s, and hits on such controversial topics as O.J. Simpson, crack  cocaine, religion, education, politics, and what has to be one of the  funniest bits ever, capital punishment vs. the Tossed Salad Man.  One word  of warning, though: it's definitely raw, filled with every four-letter  expletive in the dictionary spoken many times over, but if you can handle  it, this is one of the most satisfyingly funny stand-up routines ever.",951004800,22,819,5.128787878787879
7867621,5,630428618X,"I never was a Chris Rock fan until I saw ""Bring the Pain"" on HBO.  Every opportunity I get to watch it I anxioulsy take.  ""Saturday Night Live"" never gave just deserts to Chris's style of comedy.  And he has yet to be duplicated.  I find myself actually quoting his sayings and takes on life because...oh, it is so true.  END",902793600,2,325,4.262295081967213
