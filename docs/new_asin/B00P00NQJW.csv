8685939,4,B00P00NQJW,"I bought this for the Fairbanks version, which is quite good as silent films go.  The added bonus of the 1916 version is a curio, much lower budget with generic/canned classical music for the soundtrack.  Passable for a silent film, and interesting to see how early filmmakers interpreted the same source material.  The double-feature is definitely worth getting if you are a Dumas/Musketeers/silent fan.",1487721600,,404,5.28125
