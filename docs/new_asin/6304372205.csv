8324532,5,6304372205,"Settle in with your kids, because you'll enjoy this one as much as they do.  This appeals to a wide range of ages in children, and the animation sequence holds the attention of even preschoolers.  The main focus, though, is on the issues dealt with by pre-teens struggling through junior-high.  Make no mistake --- these are good kids trying to deal with ""tough"" situations --- but you won't find drugs or sex in this video series.  Instead, in a humourous and occasionally sobering way, Drea and her friends deal with peer pressure, sagging self-esteem, honoring committments, and even ethics in politics.  In this particular episode, Drea is trying, along with a handful of her friends, to save the school's extracurricular activities, which have been cut from the budget.  When their first few attempts at fund raisers are a bust, Drea stumbles on the perfect solution ---she vows to solve the clues in a radio contest, and donate the winnings to the school.  The whole family joins in to help, along with Matt and Rebecca, the two youngsters that Drea often babysits.  And don't count on a predictable ending --- in these videos, the kids learn that disappointment is a part of life that we have to learn to handle.  Let's just say, there's sometimes a ""twist"" put on the story, so stay tuned for the very end.  All of the videos in the series are great.  They stress good character, help kids realize they aren't the only ones dealing with certain problems, and even quote some bits of wisdom from the Bible (but don't back off --- these are anything but preachy!).  The only thing you might want to do before watching one of these is to make sure you have quick access to the rest of the series, because your kids won't want to wait!",1012608000,4,1739,4.647058823529412
