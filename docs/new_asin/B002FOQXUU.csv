3923734,3,B002FOQXUU,"Magikano is another of a long line of anime titles Funimation picked up from ADV Films that has been repackaged and assembled into a complete collection release.  The show's a pretty wild ride that covers the teenage lifestyle, spell casting, a bit of comedy with sheer wackiness.  While properties like this are difficult to neatly classify, there is no denying their unique flair and enthusiasm.  But before I get ahead of myself, let's take a look at the cold hard facts, shall we?

Magikano The Complete Series comes in at a runtime of 325 minutes and contains 13 episodes spanning two discs. The discs come packaged in a standard-sized plastic clamshell DVD case.

The show wears an appropriate TV 14 rating due to some slapstick, clothed fan service, over-the-top antics, silly gags and a hint of supernatural tones.

Language options are typical sub and dub, which means the viewer has the choice of running either the original Japanese dialog track (stereo) or an English dub (Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround) and the option of displaying English subtitles beneath either dialog choice.

Extras include textless songs, and a host of upcoming Funimation anime previews.

The story, which comes off much cleaner in action than in pixels, goes something like this:  Regular humdrum schoolboy Haruo meets a young witch named Ayumi Mamiya on his way to school one day.  Upon discovering the fact that she is capable of casting powerful spells, Haruo hardly has time to recover before realizing that he too is capable of using magic.  What's more, not only is he capable but Ayumi needs to teach him how to unlock his secret gifts and quick if the hex that's been placed upon her as a child is to be broken.

Rather than go all Yoda on him, Ayumi decides the way to proceed would be to pose as a live-in maid in effort to wear down his resistance through seduction (I seem to recall not requiring much more than the simple maid outfit in and of itself to get the job done at his age).

Even more shocking is that Haruo seems to come from a long line of practitioners himself including his own trio of younger sisters.  They just so happen to posses a magical hammer that is capable of erasing the memory of whoever it is used upon which leads both Haruo and the viewer into wondering how many times in the past he had discovered his family secret only to have his mind erased immediately after.

Like you may have figured, the show works off the idea of tension between Ayumi and Haruo's sisters, which, in addition to the usual-cattiness that is expected of competing girls of this age, is compounded by all of their ability to use magic.  In the end it comes down to Ayumi stooping to the lowest of levels (drugs, magic spells, sexual innuendos, underwear fashion shows) in effort to get Haruo's mojo working.

As much as I would like to tell you that the formula succeeds, the truth of the matter is that Magikano certainly isn't one of Gonzo's shining achievements in anime.  The lead characters' cuteness is severely compromised by the simple fact that Ayumi is a cunning, self-absorbed dominatrix rather than a cute-teen witch on a mission.

The show's pacing is equally lackluster with many episodes that crawl along with little overall plot advancement or justification for that matter.  Again this flaw could be more forgivable (or at the very least, less glaring) had Gonzo developed a cast of characters that the viewer actually cares about (an essential in this kind of anime).

As it stands however, prepare for terribly tired clich archetypes: Extremely naive lead male, dominating & manipulative lead female, overprotective family, weird secondary characters and so on.

The visuals aren't too shabby with a colorful pallet and some slick CG spell-casting sequences that add a nice dimension to the whole witch angle.  The second positive aspect to report is the commendable job by the English-voice cast (and writers) who did what they could to integrate some wit to an otherwise dry situation.

In all this is a franchise probably best avoided by those seeking a deeper meaning in the prose of their anime.  However if you are the type of viewer who found enjoyment in titles such as Seto no Hanayome, Galaxy Angel Rune or Maburaho, this may be something worth looking into.  Some of the gags work pretty well and Funimation has put out a nice full collection box set for little more than the asking price of the individual volumes.",1252540800,8,4446,4.779084967320261

3923750,5,B002FOQXUU,"I would rate the anime 4 stars but because I bought it used and it exceeded my expectations I had to give it 5.. There was no description when I bought it, so it was a shot in the dark to purchase it. I'm glad I did though because there was barely any damage on it and the DVD discs had no scratches at all. The anime itself was a lot of slapstick and ecchi-type humor. Slapstick humor isn't really my kind of humor, but the humor in this did make me giggle a bit. I'd recommend it to someone who enjoyed series' you don't really need to get all that into and also likes ecchi-ish humor.",1432339200,,587,4.0256410256410255

3923753,4,B002FOQXUU,"Animation was good, it wasn't great but I didn't expect that from this anime. The harem aspect was fairly boring, but at the same time it wasn't so terrible that it affected the story. It had good character developmen,  but I feel the creators could've done a little more to draw you in to make a connection with one of the character.  Like all decent harem animes the main protagonist didn't favor one over the others, I think the best one that did that was Sekirei (he loved them all and cared for each of them). The story progression was good as well, it didn't move to fast nor did it move to slow creating a dislike of the progression. With it being a S.A.V.E. product its a good anime at a great price. To me that makes it worth adding to the collection.",1426723200,,760,4.270833333333333

3923774,2,B002FOQXUU,"From the item description this had some potential. In the end, however, it turned out to be deeply annoying. The plot starts and ends in the last two episodes. Whilst the idea is clever two episodes can't sustain a whole series. The English version of the soundtrack features four of the most irritating female voices ever heard on a DVD. When the four geese are cackling at the same time the effect is to irritate to the extreme. This was a disappointment and it goes to charity without any regrets.",1384300800,,500,4.566666666666666

I think that's what made it so interesting for me to watch each character develop from the Enlightened Warrior of Spirituality to the 3 younger sisters to the Class President to the Spoiled Rich Eldest daughter of the Magical World.

3923785,4,B002FOQXUU,"If you read the editorial review, that's pretty much the series in a nutshell. The series never really grabbed me or got me truly involved with any of the characters, and the last episode was disappointing, at least to me. Lots of innuendo, some good laughs, distinctly NOT for younger viewers, the innuendo is pretty heavy handed.",1356393600,,331,4.824561403508772
3923786,5,B002FOQXUU,"I enjoyed this collection very much. I heard about it in a review so i decided to get. I'm glad i did. I was very pleased with the plot, characters & the voice overs. This series to me was in my top 10. I hope they continue this series.",1355702400,,236,3.836734693877551
3923787,4,B002FOQXUU,"Haruo has always believed that he was an average kid with an average life. That is far from true. He first realizes this when the new girl at school comes to live at his house with him and his 3 sisters. Ayumi, the new girl, is a witch. His 3 sisters are witches as well. They have been keeping many secrets from him. Ayumi has come to try to get him to lift a curse on her. That's pretty much the story line.

This anime is a lot of fun. It's short(13 episodes), but a series of this caliber doesn't really need more than that. This is a typical harem/ecchi series. 1 guy, half-a-dozen cute girls. It's mainly focused on the comedy aspect. There is a story line, but it really isn't important, and it doesn't get going till the end. Even without a good story, the comedy and fun characters make this s reasonably enjoyable series to watch once or twice. I have seen plenty of better harem anime series, but Magikano is fun and worth the few bucks it costs.",1354665600,2,957,4.258241758241758
3923788,3,B002FOQXUU,"A decent little series worth the price it so cheap but i definatley wouldnt pay over 20$ tops for though. The 3 sisters fighting Ayumi over their big brother is pretty funny, wich is basicly what the whole shows about.
  This is basically a comedy nothing more nothing less so if ya want a cheap laugh id recomend geting it. On the other hand if you are wanting anything more avoid like the plauge.
  I will hafta agree with what 1 poster said about the last 2 episodes they really shoulda left them out. 1 of the worse endings in any anime ive seen to date, and ive seen alot. Nothing to do with what was going on thru the whole show. They really ruined the showed on a whole. I'm a believer that no matter the show they benifit if theirs a plot to go along with the story. Sad to say u just cant throw a story in the last 2 episodes of the show and make it work like they tried to do with this 1.
  So if ya want a cheap laugh check it out, if your lookin for more avoid. Just keep in mind that the last 2 episodes are worth avoidin so watch those if u don't mind a stupid ending other wise avoid them.",1354579200,,1104,3.9728506787330318
3923789,4,B002FOQXUU,"The show was great up until the very very end of the series (both very's are implied, not a mess up). If the ending were different, I would probably give it a 5 star rating, but that was like ""What were you thinking?!"" I still prefer this ending over Neon Genesis Evangelion's ending, that one just made no sense,, this one made sense, but it was an annoying ending.",1353369600,,366,4.318840579710145

3923791,2,B002FOQXUU,"I personally thought that this series was to mumbled together. It had a weak storyline,stupid and very annoying characters,and it just didn't jive together. The animation was good,but I think that the writers should have tried to come up with a more compelling storyline. I am only giving this series a 2.1 out of 5 stars do to lack of storyline and annoying/creepy characters (one sister in particular has a strange ""obsession"" with her older brother)...",1350950400,2,455,5.0
3923792,3,B002FOQXUU,"First, this is an older anime that is presented in 4:3 format, so it won't fill the screen like newer animes.  Along with some other artistic elements, the series felt dated with a very heavy reliance on formulas.

All that being said, for the price on Amazon, I found this to be a reasonably enjoyable series.  The English dubbing was not all that bad and the story, while reasonably typical, was not completely formula based.  At least it had a few minor twists.

If you don't expect too much from it, it makes for a pleasurable distraction and I did find it refreshing that some of the English dialog was reasonably ""blunt"", as you might expect of actual conversations.  Plus there were definitely enough seriously funny moments to make it worth while.  I did not, however, find it to be all that 'ecchi', but it is not for kids.",1339977600,,832,4.543624161073826

I'm sure there are enough plot synopsis posted that i don't need to explain what's going on here.  Watch this if you want an anime that's good mindless fun.  It had a decent number of laugh out loud moments and even a memorable character here and there.  It's certainly not a top tier anime, but i wouldn't cross it off my list completely.  For 20 bucks, if I didn't have much else on my list to watch, i would give it a shot.

For similar anime, see Tenchi GXP, Negima, Demon King Daimao, and My Bride is a Mermaid (which is great but the localization sucks).",1313366400,,691,4.269230769230769

3923799,3,B002FOQXUU,"I'm not sure what edition the other reviewer had , but my copy was dubbed.
 Okay now for my review. The clueless Haruo lives with his three sisters who are witches , along comes Ayumi, another witch, who needs to unlock Haruo's hidden power to lift a curse placed on her.
 Ayumi moves in with them which leads to lots of comic moments. The screaming matches between the girls are great with insults flying everywhere. This banter back and forth is one of the high points of the show and at times is almost hilarious.
  The problem I have is the feeling that something was missing. I wasn't drawn in eagerly waiting to see what was going to happen next. Don't get me wrong, the episodes up to the last 2 episodes were watchable. They just didn't have that wow factor.
 If I could give this show 2 ratings , I would give the episodes prior to the last 2 episodes a 4 star rating and for the last 2 episodes I'd give a 0 and a punch in the face to whoever thought up an ending like that.
 I'm serious, this has the worst ending of all the anime I've seen so far. It totally ruined the show for me. It stunk , I mean 'fire the writer' stinky.
 So in a nutshell , episodes 1 thru 10 pretty good , episodes 11 and 12 don't even bother watching, which is a disappointment , the show deserved a lot better ending than that.",1285027200,32,1315,4.153543307086614
3923800,4,B002FOQXUU,"Keeping it short, it's a comedy magic type anime in the modern world with witches hiding out among the populace posing as normal people. While this may bring to mind Potter films, this one is definitely not for children. Fan service, language and, in some cases, content may not appeal to parents. For adults I would say it's worth it being a S.A.V.E. edition. It's not the best I have seen but it's at least average and maybe a little above. There is some thought in the storyline which is one of it's saving graces.

3923801,3,B002FOQXUU,"Magikano is a 13 episode harem anime, with a fair amount of (clothed) fanservice thrown in for good measure.  While I must admit that the harem genre is not my most favorite of genres, I will watch it if it seems like it would be interesting enough.

Magikano started out cute enough.  Right away we get introduced to Haruo Yoshikawa.  He is the typical clueless/naive cliche lead male character that is the standard of the harem genre.  He is relatively happy with his average life, lives with his three sisters, & doesn't really know what goes on in the world around him.  In his defense, in regards to his cluelessness, his sisters are constantly whacking him on the head with magical hammers to make him not remember stuff.  It is sort of funny @ first, but gets old after awhile as it is a reoccurring theme.  Unbeknownst to Haruo, his three sisters are witches (as are quite a few of the other cast members) & they try to keep him from discovering the family secret (that they are magic users), hence the magical hammer of forgetfulness.  I do not belive that it was ever revealed as to why they do not want him to know the family secret.  The sisters seem to be surprised about some information that they find out about Haruo towards the end of the series.  The sisters, outside of being witches, appear to be normal enough- with the exception of Maika.  Maika is Haruo's oldest sister & it would seem that she has feelings for her brother that go beyond sisterly over-protection.

We then get introduced to Ayumi Mamiya.  She is a witch who comes from the magic realm to find Haruo & that is when all mayhem breaks loose.  Haruo is apparently the only person able to lift the curse that was placed upon her as a child.  In order to awaken Haruo's dormant powers (& to lift the curse), she resorts to many crazy schemes that include becoming a maid to the Yoshikawa household, using various potions, spell casting, seduction & wearing an enchanted/cursed pair of panties. Her schemes are always thwarted by Haruo's sisters &/or a combination of other members of the cast that also have a ""thing"" for Haruo.

Magikano was an ok series overall.  Not the best I've ever seen, but by no means the worst.  The episodes, pretty much up until the last one anyway, seem kind of repetitive.  For the most part, it just seemed like the same scenarios/situations kept being played out, but with different locations & sometimes adding/introducing a new character.  After a while I almost wished that I would get whacked on the head by a magical hammer, but by then it was almost over.  The ending was like the rest of the series, just ok, nothing spectacular.  I will admit that I did get a few good laughs while watching Magikano.  If you are a fan of harem anime, fanservice, or slap stick comedy- by all means check it out.  If not, I would suggest passing on this one.",1281830400,,2867,4.531128404669261
3923802,3,B002FOQXUU,"Back in 2003, mangaka Takeaki Momose (""Miami Guns"", ""RahXephon"") released his manga series ""Magikano"" which was published on ""Magazine Z"" from Kodansha.  The manga would eventually receive a 13-episode anime series courtesy of Tokyo Kids and was broadcast on Animax in 2005 and now the complete series is available on DVD courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.

The series is directed by Seiji Kishi  (""Ragnarok the Animation"", ""Galaxy Angel Rune"", ""Yugo the Negotiator"" and ""Tentai Senshi Sunred"") and would feature a screenplay by Hideki Mitsui (""Mahoujin Guru Guru"", ""Sol Bianca: The LEgacy"", ""Tenchi in Tokyo"", etc.).  Character design is by Takashi Kobayashi (""Angel Tales"", ""Battle Skipper"", ""Hand Maid Mai"", ""Kasho no Tsuki"") and music by Katsuyuki Harada (""Galaxy Angel Rune"", ""Hime-sama Goyojin"").

The series revolves around a teenager named Haruo Yoshikawa.  Your average junior high school teenager who has never missed a day of school and lives with his three sisters Maika, Chikaki and Fuyuno.  What he doesn't know is that his sisters are witches and do whatever the can to protect their brother and not catch on that they are a magical family.  Each day his sisters use magic, they use a memory erasing hammer on him, so he doesn't remember a thing.  It's also interesting to note that the eldest sister Maika, has a brother complex (almost like an attraction) and very protective of any girl trying to get near her brother.

Meanwhile, a blonde girl named Ayumi is a witch who has been cursed when she was a child and tends to get into mischief.  So, in order to lift the curse, her father sends her out to Earth where she must befriend Haruo, the only person that can lift the curse from her.  So, in order to become close to him, she decides to become a maid at their home and moves into their house.  But how Ayumi wants to get close to Haruo is by using her body in anyway she can to attract him to her and get close to him enough to seduce him and unlift the curse.

Needless to say, the three sisters are not so happy about this and it causes chaos and the sisters will do whatever it takes to prevent ANY woman or person from taking advantage or getting close to Haruo.  Add a few more characters (who also want to be close to Haruo) and ""Magikano"" becomes a hilarious and fun harem anime series of witches who vow for Haruo's attention, while behind the scenes...someone possibly sinister is keep their eyes closely on Haruo.

The main characters of ""Magikano"" are:

THE YOSHIKAWA FAMILY

  * Haruo Yoshikawa - The main protagonist who is kind-hearted and a bit naive.  Because his sisters tend to use the memory erasing hammer on him, he rarely knows of any magical hijinks going around.
  * Maika Yoshikawa - The eldest sister who is overprotective towards Haruo.  Almost like an attraction, she wants Haruo all to herself and doesn't want any other woman close to him.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Magikano"" is featured in 4:3 standard definition.  For an anime that appeared in 2005, it doesn't have that digital vibrant color as some anime released around the same time or now.  But for the most part, where it succeeds is that each scene is not minimal and does feature a lot of focus on the animation of the characters and some scenes with really good background painting.  Character designs and capturing expressions of anger, confusion and happiness is well done.  And the zany nature of the series works well with the overall animation.  If anything, picture quality is quite clear and I didn't see any blemishes or any scratches.  Nor did I see any compression artifacts.  So, picture quality is good.

The audio is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Surround sound and Japanese stereo.  For the most part, I chose to listen to the anime series with stereo on all channels.  So, audio would be much more immersive during the action sequences.  In terms of audio, the English dub has a more teenage approach to the dialogue and although not profane, when the women get upset they yell ""bitch"" and has a more sexual curve than its Japanese counterpart.  In the Japanese counterpart, it fits the junior high school theme much more with the voices.  But because of the dialogue and of course, the women showing off their panties or trying to use sex as a way to get to Haruo, personally I found  it more sensible to watch it in English, so they seem like high schoolers than junior high students.

Subtitles are in English only.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Magikano - The Complete Series"" comes with the textless opening and ending themes and FUNimation Entertainment trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Magikano - The Complete Series"" is definitely a series that is a mixed bag.  During the earlier episodes, although hilarious and fun, the series doesn't necessarily hook you because there are so many characters and typically, you would want to see some major character development with those characters.  Granted, there are only 13-episodes in the series, so things had to speed along quickly in order to have everyone introduced.

By the second half of the series, that is when things start to become more enjoyable because it tends to focus more on Haruo and Ayumi than the other characters.  It seems the first half was to setup everyone somehow wanting to be around Haruo but the second half focuses more on Ayumi's feelings towards Haruo and that her ambition to lift the curse is being replaced by actual love for him.

But part of the problem with this harem anime series is that you have many people who like Haruo.  A typical theme of harem anime but in other harem anime, series tend to take place when the male protagonist is either a college student or a young adult.  In the case of ""Magikano"", the characters are supposed to be junior high students and the anime series wants to retain its sexual vibe.

The series tends to have a more grown up theme with the girls trying to use their bodies to attract Haruo.  I can understand if they were older teenagers in high school but not junior high.  Especially during episode 10 when Ayumi is trying to rid of her cat panties and wanted to get any reaction from Haruo so she can rid of them.  The cat spirit in the panties talking about situations down there and of course, Haruo's younger sisters then talking about lingerie and panties.  So, the  fan service may seem inappropriate for some viewers.

But for a harem anime series, it's funny and hilarious at times as the girls are at each other's necks in trying to get Haruo's attention and being the kind of guy he is, naive and not sexually active, it tends to go over his head at times.  Does it rank high up there to other harem anime series such as ""Love Hina"", ""Aoi Yori Aoishi"", ""Tenchi Muyo"" or ""Ranma 1/2'?  Not really because those series had may episodes to flesh out character development.  With only 13-episodes, the viewer is quickly introduced to characters in each episode and one can only imagine how much we are missing in terms of what was featured in the manga series.

But I was entertained and I did enjoy ""Magikano - The Complete Series"" for its humor and wackiness.  If you are looking for a harem anime series, you may want to give ""Magikano - The Complete Series"" a chance.",1255996800,,11257,4.558220889555223

It's totally random, with forgetfulness and magic and throwaway gags crammed in. It was quite difficult fo me to go through it. It just feels cheap, with a washed out quality to the art and boring designs. Though I like Japanese voice acting, the main guy's voice and charater was annoying.
