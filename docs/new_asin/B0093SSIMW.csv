8535346,4,B0093SSIMW,"I decided to watch this film because of my longtime interest in the Eastern Front. The theme is more a detective story than a war story and it is about a Spanish sergeant who is called to solve a mystery crime committed among the ranks of the Blue Division - the all volunteer force that General Franco dispatched to Russia to help Hitler's army conquer Leningrad and pay back the German support he had received himself during the brutal Spanish Civil War of 1936-39. The film's plot reveals that the wounds of that civil war were not healed while the Spanish nationalist soldiers fought in Russia, and that there were some old feuds remaining which were paid in blood. Although neither the casting nor the acting are superb, there is a Russian roulette game scene in this film which I think is the most powerful of its kind.",1406073600,,825,4.581081081081081
8535347,1,B0093SSIMW,"Horrendous ! The movie left me speechless after which I couldn't stop ranting about this major disappointment, a waste of time really.

The plot is thin, don't expect anyhing thrilling not even a shiver.
Free-masons playing the Russian roulette, Michael Cimino's style. Don't expect anything close to the history of this unique Spanish division serving within the Wehrmacht. Nothing about the phalangists either. No plot, no story, nothing historic either.

Nazi flags of all size adorn just every building, room or office on the set. Waffen-ss recruiting posters are placated here and there as a bonus. (???)

The main character, formerly a police inspector is now a butcher in the division's kitchen slaughterhouse. A ranker only, he is seconded by an NCO he calls ""Sir !"", and needs to report to superior officers who quickly forget they conveyed an enquiry.

Shame and stupor",1395100800,,879,5.125874125874126
8535348,4,B0093SSIMW,"I liked this quite unique and well made Spanish film, although it was ultimately less brilliant than what suggested by some of web reviews I read before buying it. Below, some more of my impressions, with limited SPOILERS.

This is, I believe, the first movie ever made about the Blue Division (Division Espanola de Voluntarios or Division Azul), also known as 250 Infantry Division of Wehrmacht. This 18.000 men strong unit was created by order of Franco in June 1941 and fought on Eastern front on German side from end of September 1941 to its withdrawal by Franco in October 1943. Even after that, no less than 3.000 Spanish volunteers refused to obey and formed a smaller unit, called Legion Espanola de Voluntarios, but mostly known as Blue Legion - there were even new volunteers who came to join them! In March 1944 Franco ordered all remaining Spanish volunteers to return to Spain under pain of drastic sanctions and most of them obeyed, but about 500 remained.

Those die hard veterans regrouped mostly in two Spanish companies of Waffen SS, attached succesively to SS divisions ""Wallonien"" and ""Nordland"". Some small groups and individuals served also after March 1944 in Wehrmacht units, including the elite Brandenburg division. A group of about 50 Spanish volunteers serving in Waffen SS commanded by Hauptsturmfuhrer Miguel Ezquerra fought even to the bitter end in Berlin battle in April-May 1945. In all during the World War II the victorious Red Army made prisoner 372 Spanish volunteers, most of them in 1945 - they were all send to gulag concentration camps in all kind of unpleasant places. 286 survivors were finally released in 1954.

""Frozen silence"" takes place integrally in a couple of days in February 1943, when the Blue Division was still a powerful unit, fighting along Germans on Leningrad front - this is why on the cover of the DVD you can read ""Leningrad 1943. The bloodiest siege in history"". Although no dates are given, the last day is clearly 10 February, because it shows the beginning of a massive Soviet counter-offensive, operation ""Polar Star"" which attempted to break the siege of Leningrad (it failed). It was during this campaign that Blue Division fought at Krasny Bor (10-13 February 1943) its greatest battle. All furious attacks by Soviet armor and infantry were ultimately repulsed and Red Army suffered horrible losses for no territorial gain at all - but hundreds of Spanish volunteers also died. It seems that it was after this battle that Hitler was heard to say ""Spaniards are the only tough Latins I know""...

Now, returning to the film itself, it is important to precise that this is NOT REALLY A WAR MOVIE. War is of course the always present background, a tank rolls by from time to time, some mortar shells land here and there occasionally and yes, there is the very short battle sequence at the very end, but other than that no fighting is shown. In fact, it is a war time thriller focused on a criminal mystery, but also seizing this occasion to show a gallery of characters composing the Blue Division and showing the daily life of Spanish volunteers on Eastern Front.

The criminal mystery begins with the discovery (in the first minute of the film) of the frozen corpse of a Spanish volunteer, who was clearly murdered (his throat was cut wide open). On the chest of the dead man somebody cut a message in perfectly ortographed Spanish ""Be careful, God watches you"". Puzzled and concerned by the possibility that there is a deranged killer on the lose amongst soldiers, the commander of the Division gives the task of investigating this grizzly murder to a certain Arturo Andrade, an experienced and gifted police inspector in his earlier life, who now serves (for reasons which will not be fully disclosed) as Private 2nd class in Blue Division.

That covers the first two minutes of the film and about the rest I will say just that the criminal mystery is indeed well thought and it is not possible to fully understand what is going on until the masks are dropped in the final moments of the film. The identity of the perpetrator is very well concealed and he seems for a long time so terrifying, elusive and clever as John Doe from ""Seven""...

The strong point of this film is in the climate of deep mystery, which at one moment seems to touch almost to the supernatural (but do not panic, this is NOT a horror film or a ghost story) and by moments reminded me strongly of ""The name of the rose"" with the lone investigator (and his sidekick) digging deeper and deeper in some very, very sinister secrets amongst a quite unique community of men (however no killing book is involved here)...

The images of the Eastern Front and of the daily life of Spanish soldiers are very well done. There is also a very powerful and absolutely nightmarish (and I am certain totally unrealistic) scene in which some soldiers play Russian roulette in front of a large crow of gamblers...

However, the ending of the film left me unsatisfied as some questions remained totally not-answered. Also, the way the investigator finally finds the solution has ""deus ex machina"" written all over it...

But still, I am quite glad that I bought and watched this extremely unusual and well made film. Recommended more as a thriller than as a war film, but nevertheless recommended. Its memory will certainly stay with you for some time...",1373328000,,5381,4.795037756202805
8535349,3,B0093SSIMW,"The films premise is certainly unique. Set in the winter of 1943, Frozen Silence (Silencio en la nieve) opens with one of the most bizarre scenes you will ever see. Soldiers of the Blue Division, Spanish volunteers serving in the German Army, on the Russian front discover a herd of horses frozen to death in a snow-covered lake. Among them, they find a dead body of a soldier, into whose body mysterious words have been carved.

A serious-minded private Arturo Andrade (Juan Diego Botto), formerly a police officer back in his country, is given the task of investigating this strange murder with his immediate superior, easy-going Sgt. Espinosa (Carmelo Gmez), but, while the Russian armies are getting ready to attack, the incongruous duo continue their murder investigation to uncover some unsavory secrets.

The Spanish/Lithuanian thriller is directed and produced by Gerardo Herrero, one of the executive producers of Oscar-winning Argentine film The Secret in Their Eyes, a crime drama whose story unfolds against the backdrop of extremely difficult conditions like Frozen Silence. Sadly, Frozen Silence suffers from heavy-handed direction of Herrero, who attempts to cover so much ground in the short running time. The cast is unanimously excellent, and the muted photography effective, but the mystery is not intriguing enough and story lacks a true emotional pull.

Frozen Silence is very ambitious in its subject matter and scope, but only succeeds partially. Interesting as it is, the films complicated story with this historical background needs more time and budget.",1361664000,2,1579,5.333333333333333
8535350,5,B0093SSIMW,"Just before Christmas, I came across this Spanish film from Gerardo Herrero, adapted from one of Ignacio del Valle's books. The action takes place on the Russian front in 1943 within the Azul division made up of 18000 Spanish volunteers, mostly supporters of Franco, whom the Spanish dictator had sent out as a display of his commitment to the fight against communism and to reciprocate the support that he had received from Hitler during the Spanish Civil War between 1936 and 1939.

One fine frozen morning, one of their patrols discovers the body of a Spanish soldier whose throat has been cut with a cryptic sentence carved out on his chest. The Spanish command selects Arturo Andrade, a Spanish soldier who happens to be a police inspector, to investigate this crime, believing that the murder might be inspired by Communists. Other similar murders will follow and, when Andrade gets to the bottom of it, the truth is rather surprising.

Despite being in Spanish (with English subtitles), I very much enjoyed this film, one of the bets thrillers that I have been given to see in a very long time. The suspense is quite breath taking. The atmosphere - a mixture of suspicion and despair, including between supposed German and Spanish allies - is very well captured. The whole film ""feels and sounds"" realistic and it is easy to imagine how it could have been inspired by a true story. You empathize with the main character (or at least I did) who is no super hero but just an ordinary soldier who, because of his qualifications as a civilian, gets handed a rather impossible task.

There are some rather superb scenes and fantastic pictures, including one of horses that have frozen to death in a lake, where the first body is discovered. An air raid from Russian aircraft and a ground assault by the Red Army against elements of the Azul Division are also among the best scenes, although there are about half a dozen others that I can think about. There is no ""happy ending"" here, something which is hardly surprising given the context. Early 1943 (probably in January), that is about the time when the Russians counter-attacked and trapped the German 6th Army at Stalingrad. I will however stop here to avoid any spoilers.

Well worth five stars",1357603200,,2251,4.778920308483291
