8306773,4,B001GQXS9C,"I will still give this DVD a 4 star rating, however i am very disappointed about the lenght of the film. I consider it to be deception stating that a film runtime is 240 minutes and in reality it's half that time...i have no complaints about the knockouts, they were as stated devastating, a very good DVD!!! bad product description...",1325030400,,335,4.6
8306774,3,B001GQXS9C,"It's great to have 35 knockouts on one dvd but that's all you get.  There's not a single special feature on here.

How much more would it have cost to get a 90 second interview with the fighters to hear how they set up the particular knockout?  Or make a compilation of veteran fighters telling you who they thinks hits the hardest, who they've hit the hardest and still didn't knockout, etc...

The dvd is barely over an hour long so it's not like they ran out of space on the disc.

With all this being said if you only want to buy one recent ufc dvd you're better off going with either this one or the greatest comebacks or the soon to be released best of 2008 (the latter two are available on blu ray)",1235692800,2,705,4.154411764705882
