901762,2,6304609361,If you are looking for something you can watch with your whole family including younger children this is NOT it. The story line was OK but there was at least 3 unnecessary and rough kissing scenes with the younger sister and Billy's friend. I don't know why they think we have to see this in movies. Besides that the story was OK but not nearly as good as the first one.,1324771200,,370,4.225352112676056
901763,4,6304609361,"It was worth watching, and being a disabled Veteran, I can relate. It takes awhile to get used to the regular world again. I really enjoyed the story line. LS",1272931200,2,158,4.3
901764,2,6304609361,"I am a HUGE Wilson Rawls fan. There was no attempt to make a quality video here. The cuts throughout the video were grade-school at the least. If someone would have just taken the time to edit and make sure the sound was right, this would have been a pretty good video. Mr. Rawls is howling from his grave!",1167868800,,306,4.203389830508475
901765,5,6304609361,I bought this movie for my granddaughter who had read the book with her class at school. We bought the first movie and she wanted to see the second one as well. This movie takes up a few years after the first ends. The boy is now an adult and is coming back from war with only one of his legs. He has some issues with God and why things are happening to him. It tells a good story about human beings and how friendships can help anyone. I highly recommend both movies to all families.,1142467200,4,484,4.052083333333333
901766,1,6304609361,"The storyline was weak, the acting was worse.

I hadn't seen part 1 since I was a kid, I ordered both the original and part 2.  We watched the original Sunday and my wife an I enjoyed it.  We watched Part 2 on Wednesday, and both were rolling our eyes throughout.

The actor portraying Billy did a poor job.  It is obvious that he is not a dog person, or was over acting.

The story line left a lot of holes, kind of like reading the back cover of a book instead of reading the book. Not many exciting moments throughout.

Overall the acting was overdone and no character really captured you attention.

Overall it was a feeble attempt to capture the basics of the first movie that clearly missed the mark.",1135209600,13,706,4.295454545454546
901767,3,6304609361,"I personally don't quite appreciate this movie merely because:- (1) I don't think raccoon hunting is fun. It's in fact cruel. When the grandpa spoke about unfairness in lives, he should also mention about the poor raccoons who were due to be shot by human beings. (2) Unless I have overlooked/missed out something, I can't feel Billy's love to his childhood dogs - did he ever go to visit their graves since his return?
Therefore, as an animal lover, I give the 3 stars to the dogs.",1028419200,2,482,4.551724137931035
901768,4,6304609361,"Ok, some people may completely disagree that this is better than Part I  but I can't stand the first one. Its WAY to sad and depressing, not to say  it isn't worth seeing if you havn't seen it yet. ""Where the Red Fern  Grows 2"" is years after the first one  and Billy is now returning home  after fighting in World War II. His grandpa (Wilford Brimley) suprises him  with two red-bone hounds just like the ones he had when he was a boy. At  first he doesn't accept them but finally takes them to train them to track  down racoons. Has a little bit of humor and is to a point more mature than  the first. Even though you won't be able to hold back  tears at the end,  you will treasure this classic later on and come back to see it again and  again. A must-have.",965088000,28,761,4.0675675675675675
901769,2,6304609361,"Nearly everything about this film pales in comparison to the original!  From the technical aspects-cinematography, editing, sound, ect.-to the writing and overall acting, it makes you want to pop the first film in the  DVD player and watch it yet again. One of the criteria for judging a movie  such as this is how easily and naturally it causes the tears to flow.  With  part 1, I was in tears with no difficulty at all.  The drama was so real  and spontaneous.  But with the second film you get the feeling they are  trying to grab your eyeballs to squeeze every little tear out of them.  This makes for very strained proceedings indeed. Everything considered,  Wilford Brimley and Doug McKeon DO manage to rise slightly above the  material and keep this film from getting a one-star rating but I still  think you're better off sticking with the original.",951609600,5,857,4.70945945945946
