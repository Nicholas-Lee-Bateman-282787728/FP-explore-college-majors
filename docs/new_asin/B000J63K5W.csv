8149311,5,B000J63K5W,"America is the most incarcerated country in the world.  We have more prisons and jails than anywhere else.  When looking closely at crime in our country, there isn't any simple explanation for our problematic legal system.  `The Injustice System in America' attempts to do that though and reveals disturbing information about a judicial process that is badly damaged.

First examined in this documentary is demographics concerning who is in our prisons.  Statistics show that African-American and Hispanic populations in prisons outweigh the Caucasian numbers.  Several culprits are to be found here including racial profiling and harassment, unfair treatment, and discriminatory law practices.  Relevance is also placed on the fact that more costly and experienced legal representation will better the chances of someone avoiding little if any time in prison.  Other factors shown to have an influence are police, jurors, prosecutors, and judges, depending on their racial make-up also.

Further along in the program, disparities in the sentencing process are analyzed and that reveals even more flaws in our justice system.  Compounding this is the fact that some states have what is referred to as `pro-crime' budgets for jails, prisons, and other legal measures.  Unfortunately, this takes away needed funds from such things as education, teen programs, and rehabilitation services just to name a few.

I found `The Injustice System in America' to be an above average documentary and the material shown is interesting and informative.  Interviews from lawyers, retired police officers, and other legal experts add insightful information about our decaying criminal justice system along with suggestions on how to fix the problems.  This is worth watching and I recommend it to everyone.",1177891200,3,1790,5.509157509157509
