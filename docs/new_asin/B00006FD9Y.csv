1747775,3,B00006FD9Y,"I'm frequently impressed at how well French filmmakers capture the tumultuous emotions of adolescence. While most American films try for ""popcorn pulp"" treatments of teenage life - light, cliched situations played out by kids who seem to have been cast for how well they'd grace the cover of Seventeen or YM Magazines rather than for any acting talent - Girls Can't Swim (or Les Filles Ne Savent Pas Nager, as the French call it) offers serious explorations of the minds and passions of its two fifteen-year-old protagonists, played with intense passion and sincerity by its stars. The basic premise is nothing new: Gwen and Lise have grown up best of friends, and Lise and her family spend every summer vacation at the beach town where Gwen lives. But this summer, Gwen is less inclined to spend time with Lise as she is with the local boys, who are eager to take advantage in her newfound interest in sex. Lise, whose estranged father has recently died, begins replacing Gwen as favorite in the eyes of Gwen's unemployed father. And the intimate friendship they have treasured all their lives unravels with each new conflict.
Visually, the movie is absolutely beautiful. The acting by the two stars is superb, and the characters they play are beautifully developed - fully believable adolescents. Isild Le Besco deftly captures the desperation behind Gwen's freewheeling and promiscuous experimentations with sex, and Karen Alyx infuses Lise with an almost dangerous, introverted fire, remeniscent of Melanie Lynskey in Heavenly Creatures. Many of the supporting roles were very well-played too, especially Sandrine Blancke as Lise's older sister Vivianne and Pascal Elso as Gwen's father Alain. And unlike the vast majority of cinema I've seen, this film makes a marked distinction between sex and nudity. Yes, the girls get naked from time to time; yet, with the exception of one important scene which functions as a major turning point in the story, nearly none of the nudity is involved in the sex. The love/hate duality of the relationships among the various characters within the film is honest and believable, and the ""disfunctional""-ness of the two families (and their self-destructive attempts to escape from their own lives) is well-calculated.
I can forgive all but one of the film's flaws (lack of any male characters even half as well-defined as the female ones, weak dialogue, lack of narrative coherence, etc.) on account of its strengths. But there is one I cannot forgive. At the climax of the story, a catastrophic event occurs that threatens to destroy the friendship permanently, and the film ends there. There is no aftermath, no resolution of any kind. It merely cuts off at the climax. The effect is tantamount to ending Empire Strikes Back the moment Darth Vader drops his famous bombshell about Luke Skywalker's true pedigree. All the more so because not only do you never find out what this does to the two girls and their futures, you never find out if the catastrophe that happened was purely an accident, as it seems on the surface, or if Lise had been planning it. It's one of those violations of dramatic structure that can't go by unnoticed or unobjected-to.
I'd say rent before you buy it, and judge for yourself if the powerful performances it has going for it make it worth buying despite the fact it's missing its third act.",1033257600,82,3362,4.962765957446808

This movie should be shown at film schools and kindergartens around the world.

7967807,4,B00006FD9Y,"This movie is a typical French film; with down and out parents and depressed kids and great scenery.
In this film we see two young girls who have vacationed together every summer at the beach.
But you have to pay close attention as the film follows one girls story then back tracts to follow the other girl and what she was doing at the same time, until her story catches up with where the first girls story left off.
The girls do not have a happy life until they get together and then things get strained and by the end of the film their relationship will change forever.",1298332800,,572,4.305555555555555
7967808,3,B00006FD9Y,"We begin with Gwen (Isild Le Besco), a 15 or 16-year-old girl living in a precarious situation - financially and emotionally, with regards both to her parents and her string of boyfriends - in a small, heavily tourist-dependent fishing village in Brittany.  She eagerly awaits the arrival of her friend Lise, who visits every summer during the holidays, but Lise doesn't seem to be coming this year because of problems of her own.  Gwen's father has been mostly absent, but comes home from his latest fishing expedition and decides to sell his boat - and livelihood - while her mother gets a job; now she has him to contend with as she tries to maintain a string of boys and grows increasingly frustrated.  Perhaps it is Lise she is really in love with, but the film doesn't go there....cut to the friend (Karen Alyx), in wealthier, more comfortable but no less emotionally uncertain circumstances, also faced with a serious parental problem, not able to go away for the summer, but eventually deciding she must.

The first and second parts of Anne-Sophie Birot's debut feature, each focusing on the separate travails of the two protaganists, are pretty good; Gwen and Lise are troubled but fairly typical teenagers, uncertain about sex and their futures, unable to deal with family pressures, kept going by memories of idyllic summers spent together.  Le Besco and Alyx, both a few years older than their characters, are both terrific and very convincing, and the rest of the cast, particularly Pascal Elso as Gwen's drunken and potentially abusive (but nonetheless warm and loving - no simpleton characterizations here) father, are quite solid as well.  When the two girls finally meet, in a beautifully edited scene that brings together many of the themes (fathers, writing, sexual uncertainty), I really thought this was going to turn into something special.  Unfortunately, the anger and tears that occupy much of the late part of the film often seem forced and unrealistic, and they build up to a resolution that is both contrived and unnecessary - not a ""Hollywood"" ending, exactly, but a deliberate heightening of drama that is probably supposed to come off as very emotional but just seemed stupid to me.  We can guess that the girls are going to have problems together, from what we've seen of their separate early-summer days apart - we don't need the over-the-top behavior and deliberate shocks that we're given.

Despite the problematic last act, the film still has plenty of merit in the acting, the feel for the landscape and culture of a sleepy seaside coastal town, and the gorgeous photography (by Nathalie Durand).  And for most of it's length, it certainly feels more realistic and compelling than the majority of teen dramas one gets in America.  All in all, an ambivalent feeling for me.",1257724800,,2809,4.942675159235669
7967809,2,B00006FD9Y,"This movie epitomizes the sub-genre of ""French films"".  Which is to say it engenders every tired stereotype of what makes some French films either unwatchable or unenjoyable (the other type of films from France or by French directors, including Jean-Pierre Juinet/Luc Besson/ etc, who have a good sense of pacing and action and frenetic mood).

To explain my statement about stereotypical French films, the movies in question consistently consist of stilted arthouse drama with unlikable characters who do not have much use for the concept of understatement or indoor voice, whose lives are always immersed in melodrama, whether or not circumstances warrant it.  These films also do not seem to place much value in pacing, and indeed regard a slow and plodding progression as an indication of depth and thought, even if such elements are not evident.  Something else that seems troubling about this kind of French film (if not the culture itself) is the seemingly nonchalant attitude about physical coercion in sexual encounters.  In more than one interview, Gerard Depardieu has cavalierly waxed nostalgic about participating in gang rapes during his teen years.  Correspondingly, this film has more than one occasion of where a teenage girl is assaulted, and in each case the matter is regarded with minor (if any) attention at best.

There is also the inveterately disfunctional interactions between all parties in this film, as is so common.  As it turns out, hardly of the characters are particularly likable or sympathetic.  The father was conveyed as a marginally sympathetic character at the end, until his encounter with Lise.  One thing I will give the French credit for is that they do not feel compelled towards using formulaic, predictable happy endings.

Aside from this, the title has an apt metaphor in the plot that has been mentioned in other reviews.  However, I was not very impressed with the film, for the plodding execution and other reasons listed.  I didn't think the movie was completely terrible, but I also think it wasn't very strong (barely 2 stars).  Additionally, both the film's synopsis and several other sources are guilty of misleading descriptions regarding the so-called erotic/sensual nature of the girls' relationship.  If this is why you are renting it, you will be very disappointed.  Otherwise, if you are an unremitting Francophile or praiser of foreign films, you will find some excuse to laud this film, if for no other reason than your need to.",1176854400,4,2491,5.128712871287129
7967810,3,B00006FD9Y,"This is one of the better films I,ve seen from France. Romance was a good film with awful dialog, this films' dialog was some what better. The story was good although tragic. As with all French films, I think there is a problem in the translation and the dialog always sounds so stupid, at least in subtitles. Maybe dubbed versions are better, I don,t know as I haven't checked them out. This film is worth a look, as it has a good storyline and not as artsy as you might think.

7967812,2,B00006FD9Y,"I don't remember seeing Isild Le Besco in any other films, but she does look a bit familiar.  If I have seen her elsewhere, it must have been in a role that she performed with much greater insight and finesse than Gwen from 'Girl's Can't Swim', or I definitely would remember.  I'm still not sure what the title actually means... something about young women struggling to find their way... blah blah blah... but, it actually wasn't a terrible film.  Nevertheless, Le Besco's performance is one of the most irritating I've seen in years.  I was reminded of Dorothy Parker's cutting remark when critiquing a Katherine Hepburn film: 'She runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.'

Le Besco was either shown with an extremely obnoxous smile plastered on her face, or she was smacking her friends or family in a 'hissy fit of rage'.  These tantrums always ended with Gwen running off to the sea with all the grace of a three-legged moose.  What made LeBesco's performance stand out even more was the fact that everyone else's performances were nearly flawless.

This film was recommended to me after purchasing 'L'Effrontee', a truly marvelous picture.  While watching the first 30 minutes of 'Girl's Can't Swim' I could see that I was not the only person who admired 'L'Effontee's' subtle brilliance.  Obviously the director and/or screenwriter of 'Girl's Cant' Swim' intended on building upon the other film's message, but as a lark, they subtracted all of its poignance and sensitivity.

I give the film 2 out of 5 because, despite its flaws, it is still superior to the vast majority of 'toejam' that hollywood produces each year.",1105660800,9,1628,4.86231884057971
7967813,4,B00006FD9Y,"A French coming-of-age art film that I rented while on vacation.  Despite rave reviews all over the packaging, this story of two moody teenage girls growing apart as sexuality enters their lives seemed pretty slow and predictable, even a bit tedious.  Jet lag set in and we gave up two-thirds of the way through the film, and took it back the next day. In all fairness, this is probably a fine film if you're in the mood for Serious Art, but I found it a bit dreary.",1036108800,16,466,4.344827586206897
