2604429,2,B000GBD6OU,"The Blu-Ray version of the Castellani ""Romeo and Juliet"": this is one of the greatest movies of all time. Castellani was surely not a Visconti nor a Rosselini, but his ""Romeo and Juliet"" is absolute perfection. However, this Blu-Ray incarnation is a disaster. The glorious cinematography (Robert Krasker) is disgraced by a white-washed remastering. The ball scene is completely distorted. The colours that were once a magnificent succession of Renaissance paintings now appear irritatingly blurred. And - alas ! - there is more: subtitles are frequently a gross distortion of the original text - e.g.: in the DVD version the master of ceremonies at the Capulet's ball announces that ""... the musicians of Saint Jerome will now play..."" In the Blu-ray captions read ...""the musicians of CENTER ROME will now play..."". Ghastly. Also, many dialogues are not transcribed, and one frequently bumps into an ""a"" or a ""the"" in capital letters in the middle of a sentence. The whole transcription is absolutely amateurish. Therefore, keep your precious DVD of this masterwork and forget this third-rate Blu-Ray.",1343865600,8,1102,5.267045454545454
2604430,5,B000GBD6OU,"This is a review of the Renato Castellani film, ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1954).
I must admit that I purchased this blu-ray with misgivings. Laurence Harvey
as Romeo? I remembered him as Colonel Travis in John Wayne's ""The Alamo""--not a
good omen that he would be able to pull off the role, which is light years removed
from that of the worthy Texan. But surprise, surprise! He does just fine. He is over
fifteen years younger in ""Romeo,"" really hardly resembling the Laurence Harvey
I remembered, and most importantly, he is young enough to be credible as Juliet's
lover (sorry, Leslie Howard). But what about the two Leonards, you say. As to Whiting,
he certainly looks the part, and I have fond memories of Zefferelli's version. As
to DiCaprio's ""Romeo,"" I refuse to watch it, mired as it is in the current trend
to update the story to so-called ""modern"" times, where the audience is presumably deemed
too moronic to apprehend universal truths in a historical setting different from
our own day.

As to Juliet, Castellani's Susan Shentall does fine also. She is suitably attractive, as is
Olivia Hussey in Zefferelli's version. I cannot really say I prefer one over the
other, though it has been a while since I have seen the Zefferelli film. Hopefully,
a blu-ray treatment is in the offing. Norma Shearer we can summarily dispatch as a
competitor, for the same reason--age--that we dismissed Leslie Howard: this is a work
that cries out for really young lovers. The Juliet of Leonard Di, is, of course, not
in the running for the same reason I have disqualified her colleague--the abiding idiocy
of filming the play as a contemporary drama. Now, I have no problem with a film
like ""West Side Story,"" which basically has many of the same plot elements; but it
does not literally use the same title and pretend to be ""Romeo and Juliet.""

Why do I prefer Castellani's film over Zefferelli's? They are both gorgeously filmed,
in Italian locales peculiar to Shakespeare's story. One reason is not Zeferelli's fault: in his version,the actor who portrays Friar Laurence, Milo O'Shea, is inextricably linked in my mind with Jane Fonda and ""Barbarella"" (there now, that ""guilty pleasure"" is duly admitted).
I simply can't watch the film without thinking of that. Mervyn Johns, on the other
hand, seems magnificent as the somewhat addled, but well-intentioned friar. I do admit
that it's hard not to think of him as Bob Cratchit opposite Alastair Sim's Scrooge
in the 1951 version of Dickens' ""Christmas Carol"" (also available on a VCI blu-ray).

The most important reason to prefer the Castellani version is the music. Its music
is period specific, of a type which actually could have been played at the time of the
story. Is it memorable? Not particularly, but in the context of the film, it serves
its purpose well. The music of Zefferelli's ""R & J,"" however, has one lush theme, a leitmotif
if you will, which dominates the movie in much the same manner as ""Lara's Theme""
dominates David Lean's ""Doctor Zhivago."" Indeed, that is all I remember of the music.
This theme is, in fact, a kind of cue, which is supposed to tell us when we should be
stirred by the passion of the lovers or by some turn in the plot. It is all so very
mechanical, so very insulting to the intelligence of the viewer, and ultimately, as
a Grammophone reviewer once remarked, ""so very tiresome."" Even beautiful music, repeated
to the point of tedium, loses it effect. The music in the Castellani film at least
has the merit that it does not wear out its welcome.

How is the picture quality on this release? Is it perfect? No. Is it good enough that
it would be churlish to complain and nitpick about picture quality? Yes. That said,
the only real negative which struck me about the visuals was the appearance, for a few
seconds, of what appeared suspiciously like telephone lines, as Romeo approached the crypt
where Juliet, under the influence of the potion given by Friar Laurence, is feigning death.
This was probably unavoidable, or at least traceable to the original source material, not
due to some deterioration in the film stock. Caveat: all of the foregoing remarks are
made after having viewed this release on a 42"" LCD television. I make no representations
as to how it may look on a larger screen, though I suspect it will be fine.

To sum up, if you want a film version of Shakespeare's play, not a film of a theatrical production, with very satisfactory principals, great supporting players (Mervyn Johns, Sebastian Cabot, Bill Travers, Flora Robson and, last but not least, John Gielgud), set in a locale which is both geographically and historically accurate, this is the version for you. Picture and audio quality are fine. The true Shakespeare aficionado will, of course, want
the Zefferelli if and when it becomes available on blu ray as well as a worthy film
of a stage production. How spoiled we have become in this electronic age!",1332374400,4,4920,4.783529411764706
2604431,4,B000GBD6OU,"Of the several different cinematic adaptations of ROMEO & JULIET that are out there, this version has always been my personal favorite since I first saw it in the early 1970s. Not the best, mind you, hence 4 stars instead of 5. The Franco Zefferelli production has that distinction but if you've never seen this one, then you should definitely give it a try now that VCI has given us such a gorgeous looking anamorphic transfer. For years I have had the old MGM VHS tape which I will now gladly donate to the local thrift store where there are still customers who use VHS. There's no need to go into the story since everyone knows that, so I'll focus on what it is about this particular adaptation that I enjoy so much.

First are the locations. The film was shot on location in Verona and other Italian cities in such a way as to resemble Renaissance paintings thanks to the skill of legendary cinematographer Robert Krasker (THE THIRD MAN) who shows here that he can use color the way he used black and white in that classic film. Second is the score by Roman Vlad which is written in the style of music of the period. A galliard which serves as a motif throughout the movie is memorable and effective. Last but not least are the performances. Laurence Harvey, 25 at the time, gives the best line readings of any screen Romeo I have ever heard. Some find his Romeo too effiminate but that will always be a matter of personal opinion. Susan Shentall is not the ideal Juliet but she is more than adequate and her death scene manages to be quite moving. Add character players Flora Robson, Bill Travers, Mervyn Johns and Sebastian Cabot to the mix and their characters spring to life.

Italian director Renato Castellani creates an ideal balance in his movie with a theatrical staging that flows cinematically. The style of dialogue delivery is old school Shakespeare which will seem overly mannered to today's younger ears but you can understand every word and, after all, it is a play. My one complaint, which has to do with the DVD only, is that the English subtitles (handy in Shakespeare) are out of sync after the first 30 minutes appearing a few seconds before the characters speak their lines and then disappearing too quickly which is disconcerting for those of us who use them. Nevertheless it is great to finally have this R & J on DVD and Blu-Ray where it will now reach a new audience who can see it for themselves and make their own comparisons with other versions. This release is part of a new series from VCI of classic Rank Organisation films and about time too!",1304294400,9,2579,4.556034482758621
2604432,5,B000GBD6OU,"Apart from the fact that no admirer of Laurence Harvey would want to miss his captivating performance as young Romeo, this is a movie for adults-the passion between the two lovers, as it slowly grows, is very different from the tepid teenage performances of other ""Romeo and Juliet"" versions, or rather, it makes them appear tepid.

I had not ""sensed"" Shakespeare's heart in this story until I saw Castellani's mesmerizing film; each lush frame to be indulged and enjoyed like sips of fine aged cognac. Unlike other versions which are mainly a treat for the eyes, this one is a real treat for eyes, ears, mind, and emotions.",1172016000,7,624,4.777777777777778
8130416,3,B000GBD6OU,"I can't think why this 1954 version of ""Romeo And Juliet"" is so ""under the radar"", so to speak. I had never heard of it until I saw it listed in several movie catalogues. Perhaps it is overshadowed by Franco Zefferilli's more famous 1968 movie version? Like Zefferilli, director Renato Castellani obviously adores Shakespeare. And, like Zefferelli, Castellani shot it on location in Italy. It is all very ""Shakespeare reverent."" This is a visually sumptuous film, gorgeously photographed by Robert Kraskner. Kraskner, in fact, deserves most of the praise. His cinematography is the main highlight of the film. The costumes by Leonor Fini are excellent. It's very pretty and Shakespeare ""appropriate."" (i.e. Romeo and  other male characters wear ""tights""). John Giegud as ""The Chorus"" actually appears as William Shakespeare himself. I'll give this version extra bonus points for that.
  Laurence Harvey, eight years away from his most famous role in ""The Manchurian Candidate"", is a handsome Romeo, with curly brown hair and blue eyes. Harvey looks good ""in tights"" and looks properly besotted by blonde Susan Shentall as Juliet. If you haven't heard of Shentall, there's probably good reason. She apparently retired from acting after ""Juliet"" and nobody missed her. The supporting cast, featuring Flora Robson (""Wuthering Heights"", ""Fire Over England"", ""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland"") as Juliet's nurse and Sebastian Cabot (""Family Affair"") as Capulet, is much better.
  So, between the gorgeous cinematography, handsome Harvey and pretty Shentall, there's a lot of nice ""eye candy"" going on. And Shakespeare lovers are mad for the ""beautiful poetry of his language."" But this version did not hold my interests. I tried, twice. I got to the part where Romeo is banished after killing Tybalt, and just couldn't make it through the rest of the film. Part of this, I'm sure, comes from the fact that, while I love theatre, I do not regard Shakespeare as ""The Greatest Playwright Of All Time."" He was a playwright who wrote some excellent plays, some bad ones, and some over-rated ones. ""Romeo and Juliet"" is neither good nor bad, neither here nor there, in my opinion. I much prefer the grit and pulsating rhythms of Jerome Robbins' brilliant ""Romeo And Juliet"" re-imagining ""West Side Story"" to the rhythms of Shakespeare's iambic pentameter verse. I can relate to ""West Side Story"", which makes more sense to me in every conceivable way than any version of ""Romeo and Juliet"". But Shakespeare fans will likely give this version a higher rating than my three stars. This version is, after all, gorgeous to  look at.",1463875200,,2618,5.148235294117647
8130417,5,B000GBD6OU,"Romeo and Juliet has been filmed countless times. This one is my favourite, despite the leads having been played by two remarkably lackluster 'stars'. Susan Shentall (Juliet), who retired from films after this, looks the perfect part of Juliet, although perhaps more Van Eyck than Botticelli. Laurence Harvey left a huge body of film work upon his death, and Romeo was certainly not one of his more remarkable achievements, but again, he looks the part. Why is this my favourite version? The supporting cast is superb. John Gielgud (Chorus), Flora Robson (the Nurse),, Mervyn Johns (the Friar), Norman Wooland (Paris), Sebastian Cabot (Lord Capulet), and Bill Travers (Benvoglio), all were outstanding, The sets and costumes, nd the music, too, were superb,as well..",1463529600,,766,5.286885245901639

She watched the 1954 version this year in high school, but never watched the 1968 version. So I watched this one and she watched the 60s version. Both are great adaptations.

8130423,4,B000GBD6OU,"We watched this play for my high schooler's english class, so we wanted a version that was close to actual play, yet entertaining enough to keep the high schooler""s attention, even though the old english is difficult to understand. But, the actions, acting, and expressions helped to get across what was going on in each scene. I have not read the play since I was in high school, but I think that they left out some of the lessor scenes, probably to keep it to about 2 hours. I did notice that the BBC version is 3 hours, which makes me think that it is the complete version. But, I do not think that our teens would not be able to sit through 3 hours of it. I did shed a tear at the end. So, I feel that it did the job.",1368662400,,721,4.048951048951049

The players are not as old as in the 1930s version w/Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard, nor as young as with Olivia Hussey.  However, the beauty of the production and its music score are stunning.  The court dances are eerie (strange) but beautiful.  I had seen it as a child and it haunted me for years.  I am pleased to recommend it.",1357948800,,422,4.5
