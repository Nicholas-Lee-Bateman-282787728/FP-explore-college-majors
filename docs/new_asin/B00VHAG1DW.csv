7090446,5,B00VHAG1DW,"What a wonderful Blu-ray edition of the final Alexei German's masterpiece! The film comes with a small but thoughtfully made booklet with some excellent photographs from the set. It includes Director's statement, an essay by German's son, himself a filmmaker Alexey German, Jr., and a very nice short overview of German's body of work written by Aliza Ma, a film curator at Museum of the Moving Image (where the first North American screening of the film took place).
There is one factual error in the article. It states that the film had a ""higly anticipated premiere at Cannes in May of 2013"". In fact German vowed not to send his film to Cannes due to the extremely negative and unfair reception his ""Khrustalev, my car!"" has previously received there and by which the director felt deeply thraumatized. The premiere of ""Hard to be a god"" took place in Festival internazionale del film di Roma in 2013.
The bonus features include trailer of the film and, most importantly, an extremely valuable behind-the-scene TV documentary by Pyotr Shepotinnik    122  85 /Today Germans blood pressure is 122/85. The film includes conversations with Alexei German filmed on the Lenfilms set of Hard to be a god during the production, the directors interactions with Leonid Yarmolnik (Rumata) and Svetlana Karmalita (director's wife, assistant and scriptwriter), and offers a glimpse of what the film would look like if it was shot in color. The documentary also includes many excerpts from German's other films, even fragments of the rarely seen in Russia tinted version of ""Ivan Lapshin"". This is a tiny taste of the great thngs that might one day become available, if we don't skimp on this current offering! :) I highly recommend both the film and the Blu-ray.
Now I cant wait to see what Arrow comes up with for their much anticipated UK Blu-ray edition to top the Kino!",1435968000,7,1864,4.907936507936508
7090447,1,B00VHAG1DW,"The Middle Ages in Europe were not quite this dirty!  At their worst after the fall of Rome, and in the absolute worst of places, what you see in this movie is no where near a representation of life in the Middle Ages.  Post Apocalyptic world maybe, but not the Middle Ages.  Do not see this movie for a feel of live in the Middle Ages.
So if you are not looking for a historical period piece maybe you are in the move for a fast moving adventure.  In this movie, the chickens are the fastest moving creatures.  Maybe a deep drama.  Well the hole for the latrine is pretty deep, but deep thought, forget it.  I can't think of a single reason to see this move that will not leave you disappointed.

7090453,1,B00VHAG1DW,"I really don't know where to start.  I read the book before watching the movie.  As it is said, the movie is never as good as the book. Here there is very little relationship between the two.  The book is a little disjointed because it is a translation.  The version I read was the second translation into English and supposedly is better than the first translation.

Someone wrote that this was one of the filthiest movies made and that is probably true.  B&W was the right shoice and the scenery, costumes, and props really convey this.

All of the peripheral actions take away from the story and what the book is trying to tell. I understand German is trying to portray a disgusting, backwards world however the constant nose blowing, spitting, vomiting....not in the book and unwarranted.  Aside from telling us that these Dons are scientists who have traveled back in time, it tells nothing of why they are on Arkanar and what their rules of being on the planer are - why are they considered gods ?

Rumata is portrayed as a drunken rambler in the movie.  The impression you get from the book is that he is an observer who plays by the rules and his prolonged presence on the planet and observation of this delayed society has caused him to become somewhat callous and question his interactions with those around him and question his own humanity....For example, his relationships with his servants and Kira.

The end of the movie is not even close to the ending of the book.  In the book you are able to tell if Rumata has been saved or not.

Cinematographically the movie accomplishes its' goal, but, I beleive, falls very short of what the Strugatsly brothers wished to present as a study in human nature.",1491955200,,1713,4.6138613861386135

I found the book dense, and only the translators' notes made clear how this satirized the Soviet system, while having to pass through that system's censorship. As a novel, that forced subtlety onto it, far beyond the demands of dramaturgy. (Not being sent to the gulags counts as a demand, I should think.)

Cast in black and white, this displays contrasts color might obscure. It does nothing, however, to mask the squalor of the common folk (think Soviet narrative again). Then, for me, this never reaches the threshold I thought it might not: the subtle separation, as thin as the layer between oil and water, between the observing narrator and the observed. That divide sits tissue-thin throughout the book, until the end. I don't think I can fault the medium or its usage. The book, though, maintained the inner-vs-outer personality divide that I found so worth following, Be it the fault of me or of the movie, I never caught that thread so necessary for making sense of the whole.

So, in the end, I never found the delicate divisions the book led me to expect. Lacking that, I found squalor and brutality. I'm sure I saw those as expected. I felt myself compelled to find more, though, and did not. I'll try again, but don't have my hopes up.

7090459,5,B00VHAG1DW,"One of the most entrancing cinematic experiences in my memory, most certainly. German's final film is absolutely a masterwork, and a worthwhile homage to one of the greatest science fiction stories ever written. Filled from end to end with unbelievable design work and photographic composition, as well as serving as a prime example of the kind of film that compels deep engagement with a sense of utterly alien strangeness (a hallmark of similar talents like Tarkovsky, who with 'Stalker' found his own deserved success with a similarly-spirited adaptation of a work by the genius Strugatsky Brothers). Of course, Yarmolnik is great in the starring role as a distant-future Earth scientist living in an oppressive medieval society on an alien planet, struggling between his ethics and his morals, and striking the perfect balance between sadness and humor.

For the same reasons that make it great, 'Hard to Be a God' will be easily misunderstood by many and entirely off-putting to those with any need for familiar, stated context or 'simple' narrative. This is something that I feel is mostly due to its being completely dedicated to a whirlwind, uncompromising sort of 'in medias res' storytelling. Beyond a short epigram explaining the basics at the start of the film, very little is given to the viewer in terms of context, so I wouldn't recommend for folks who aren't in for a mind-bender. If you're interested in something beyond categorization, built on a genius science fiction story with considerate, timeless themes, then consider this one well worth your time. Certainly for fans of literary science fiction, too, as this one shows just how far a good sci-fi story can go in capturing deep, resonant human themes. I've never seen anything like it, with perhaps some of Tarkovsky's films being the only others coming close. Fans of his work will definitely have a good time here.

That's appropriately referencing a work from the late Middle Ages which is where German has set this masterpiece. I've never witnessed, or more precisely, been so immersed in a parallel world reeking of such stench. My attraction repulsion impulse was mercilessly exposed to the extent that I doubt I've endured such experience in a theatre. At home while comfortably lounging, the pause button could spare me. The narrative seems of little relevance as the cast of grotesques relentlessly parade their perversions seemingly with little need of story. The cinematography is astonishing. The soundtrack left to disgorge the multitude of slobberings, suckings, squelchings of the miserable claustrophobic interiors. Heads, arms, fingers almost poke through the camera in extreme closeup. The camera feasts on the textures of hair, skin, and props peculiar to the imagined period. When on occasion the lead characters escape these confines to wander aimlessly through the murky outside, the camera casts an elevated view over these deplorable events, reminding me of some of Salgado's most memorable black and white images.

7090465,5,B00VHAG1DW,"Like Mad Max: Fury Road, HTBAG can be confusing or disorienting if you don't have a little background about the story. This film version of HTBAG, from 2013, has a narrator in the beginning to set the stage, but even for someone who's seen the other film version, and read the book, German's version is deliberately a challenging viewing experience. To tackle this version (2013), I'd recommend reading the source novel and even seeing the first filmed attempt (the one with a cameo by Werner Herzog). German's version is pretty cinematically amazing: it's beautiful by being relentlessly grotesque; it has long, orchestrated scenes that are incredible to behold; and it does a good job at capturing the other-worldliness that the story is about. The first time you see German's version, it's pretty must just an overwhelming visual and sound design experience; on a second viewing you can begin to understand better what's going on. The whole thing is pretty impressive filmmaking, and like nothing I'd ever quite seen before. Even though it's subtitled, there isn't that much to read, as much of the story is told visually.

7090469,5,B00VHAG1DW,"I can understand some folks' frustrations with this film.

Essentially you are thrown into this ugly dark age world without even a speck of light that Christianity gave to our own medieval times. You are exposed to incomprehensible foul rituals from the get go. The camera work shoves multiple events in your face constantly. It's in crisp black and white. It's Russian to the bone and subtitled. And it's actually not a semi-medieval fantasy it's science fiction. And it's as intense as a hernia. What's not to love?

Taking his cue from Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev, who throws the viewer into the Russian Middle Ages without concessions, Aleksei German submerges us into a horrific world without beauty and few hints of redemption. I watched this in Blu-ray on a healthy sized screen having carved out the needed three hours to literally wade through this demented and highly personal epic. When I was done I felt like I had crawled through a thousand year old sewer. But wow! What an exceptional experience. There are few people making movies today who can equal the awful and memorable power of this beast. This is by definition not for everybody.

7090473,2,B00VHAG1DW,"This movie was very frustrating to me. If it had been a bad movie - pure and simple - it would not have frustrated me so much. I would have simply dismissed it and moved on with my life. However, there was something beautiful and wonderful about this film. It presents an Un-romanticized version of the Middle Ages with an aesthetic that I found quite compelling. The problem is: the aesthetic of the film went hand in hand with a story that was essentially unintelligible to me. I do understand the basic plot line: Don Rumata is a human on another planet that is stuck in the Middle Ages and he is searching for Budakh. Even with that understanding many of the scenes in the film made no sense to me. The dialogue was extremely cryptic, I often had no idea what any of the characters were talking about, who they were, where they were, or how the scenes fit together.

If the filmmakers had condescended to their audience just enough to make this movie actually intelligible I think it could have been one of the greatest movies ever made. I would have gladly sat through three hours of mire and filth and digressions that lead nowhere if the filmmakers had made it possible for me to understand what I was watching. I do not demand a lot from a movie. I am fine with a minimal plot. I do not need car chases and sword battles to keep me interested in a movie. I am fine with digressions. And that is something I thought this film actually did brilliantly: there is a lot happening that has nothing to do with the actual plot and it gives it a very intersting feel. I am fine with slow black and white films with little dialogue and strange characters. I am fine with all of that. I just need to know what is happening! Otherwise, my experience is not that different from sitting in a room and having random lights flashed into my eyes.

I get frustrated with the split between popular culture and high art in our culture. I am not sure if that has always existed. It seems to me that in past ages great artists did not feel the need to make their work unintelligible to the masses. People loved Sophocles and Shakespeare, their work was intelligible and profound, and people liked it. It did not consciously erect a barrier between itself and the hoi polloi. I do not know why we have this idea that great art has to be difficult and unappealing to the majority of the population. Perhaps it is a reaction against capitalism and the Hollywood machine. Whatever it is, I find it frustrating, because it is very difficult for me to find movies I like. Popular movies are often boring to me. I cannot watch a five minute chase scene without wanting to tear my hair out. But art house movies are often just as boring for a different reason. I wish we could agree on a middle ground. Yes, by all means, make movies that focus more on emotional depth, characterization, and philosophical profundity rather than special effects and action. But make them interesting and understandable! Please! Interesting and intelligible are both valid aesthetic categories (I might even include entertaining on that list at the risk of being labelled a Philistine). Can we agree?",1438819200,16,3161,4.53415061295972
7090474,2,B00VHAG1DW,"This is truly a SINGULAR work. It's grotesque. It's brutal. It's a fully enveloping world that might even surpass Blade Runner, The Dark Crystal or the City of Lost Children for it's depiction of a made-up universe on film. It has an entrentched, ugly, realistic tone that puts it outside of the fantasy and sci-fi filmmaking which it's ""plot"" is loosely based on. This movie is a MASTERPIECE of auteur filmaking. It is sincerely an unparalleled achievement in aesthetics, set design, costuming, art direction and cinematography.

What it isn't, is a masterpiece of ENTERTAINMENT.

Looking at the less then 20 reviews posted already, you have to imagine that the only people who would already even know about this film are real movie fans and cinefiles, so I would sincerely take the one and two star reviews at FACE VALUE. It's not a case of people ""not getting"" something. This is a movie that might be worth watching once. ONCE. I guarantee you, this film might get a repeat viewing from one person out of every 500 people who see it in their lifetime. It won't be anyone's favorite film, it will be too obscure to be influential in any way. It's too long and repetitive to be entertaining. There's zero humor, little suspense and it's too distancing and alien to be absorbing. It is a real slog.

It is a visually stunning and densely packed piece of film. It's a film you could be impressed with, a film to respect, a film to admire for the director's long-term dedication to the project and his uncompromising vision. But that doesn't make it a masterpiece or a classic. I very much doubt ANY of the people who give this movie 5 stars or even 4 will EVER watch it again. It will be a DVD hanging out on the shelf of their huge video collection - a badge of honor for sitting thru such a long, tedius, mucky film. To put it into perspective for those in the know - I've managed to sit thru Tarkovsky's ""Stalker"" three times - and Hard to be God is even more confusing, slowly paced and tedious than THAT!

I noticed multiple reviews of people saying it took them days to finish it. It's generally a physically exhausting and repulsive film to sit thru. It's something a viewer won't be able to get around - To simply sit and enjoy what they're watching.  With a long running time, an obscure and confusing narrative that lacks any momentum and many patches of boredom, the only reason I rate this two stars is for it's technical and artistic achievements.

1. Could have been five stars, but three hours of basically the same difficult to understand scenes and story was exhausting. A bit of editing (like half) and you would never have known since everything was redundant from dialogue to action to mud.
2. The science is really bad, but in this case it makes no difference because it doesn't play into the story. The science is someone is sent from Earth to bring order to another planet that basically is identical to middle ages Europe from pigeons to horses to buildings to inhabitants. If the state/condition of this other planet is suppose to have some metaphorical meaning - I missed it.
3. As far as the God angle - having control over others lives - I had a hard time finding that message in this film. Maybe it was attention span, or translations, or scene overload?
Positives:
1. The camera work was unique in that practically every scene is claustrophobically close in.
2. The sets and props (buildings, clothing, swords, etc.) were amongst the best I've ever seen in a period film. Very nastily real. The conditions were beyond the worst imaginable even for the extreme poverty and slum enclaves of Bangladesh, India, Mexico, Brazil.
3. Not a black & white film, but gray and gray. Everything is gray from mud to people to buildings and it all works to convey information and mood.
4. The conveyance of delusion, psychosis, schizophrenia from bizarre behaviors to nonsensical language permeate every scene along with 
5. Disgusting beyond belief fecal, snot, saliva spitting/sharing, mud sharing, body gouging scenes even imaginable (""Centipede"" and ""Game of Thrones"" are tame, comparatively).
6. Many of the cast were selected and made up to convey a freak show setting; not sure if one could legally film such characterization in the U.S. today, but intended, I think, to show the decay of civilization.

7090479,2,B00VHAG1DW,"Hard to be a God is a dystopian movie.  It purports to be set on another planet with a history like our own but stuck in a period centuries before the Renaissance,  in the middle of the Middle Ages.  But that is absurd.  The film has nothing to do with that era in history, with the Medieval period, of which it would seem to be virtually ignorant.  It is instead a vision of a life and a world of unremitting cruelty and filth.  It is in fact a product of what might be called a gnostic imagination in which creation is the work of an evil god or demiurge.  I don't mean that the movie explicitly states that viewpoint, but it nonetheless envisions it.  Matter in every respect is corrupt, people are ugly and contemptible, and the world is horrendous. What the movie lacks is any sort of spiritual alternative.

Hence it wallows in mud, dirt, filth, blood, intestines, feces, unrelenting fog or rain, and cruelty.  I don't think I have ever seen a movie in which cruelty, violence, destruction are all that concern it.  It is a world and a film obsessed with stench.  Smells, stinks appear to have an almost magical force in its world.  The body is displayed unforgivingly as always or nearly always suffering, deformed, corrupt, diseased, putrid, vulnerable.  It is infected with larvae, insects, and unnamed illnesses of all the excretory tracts.  Snot, too, has a curiously constant presence.  Ears are cut off, noses ripped.  It is a film inspired, it would seem, mainly by disgustin humanity, in the human body, in corporeality, of course, but in all material presence.  The ""earth"" this film depicts is as noisome as the people who inhabit it.

Underlying it, I suspect, is not the Middle Ages but World War Two when atrocities by both sides were common on the so-called Eastern Front.  'Atrocity' is a key word.  Hard to be a God is about an atrocious world.  But its ruminations, in the dialogue, about God are sophomoric.  They sound like someone who has just begun to read Nietzsche or the more extreme moments in Dostoevsky.  This is perhaps more evident in its near plotlessness.  The narrative matters no more than characters do since everyone in it behaves in exactly the same ways.  There is no difference among The Grays, The Blacks, The Red Headed and so on.  None of the warring tribes differs from any of the others.  All its people are equally apt to resemble one another.  They are all equally and unqualifiedly awful.  Atrocity in this film is in essence always anonymous.  But in life, though it may seem so, it never is.

Some of the film, at moments, therefore begins to resemble The Three Stooges.  I mean by that strange analogy to imply only that violence is done, happens for its own sake, without motive or reason.  The world is the function of an insane plan or an as crazy chance, take your pick, that leads inevitably to violence.  And, like the Stooges, the people in the film are deliberately grotesques, not human beings but freak show caricatures.  In this way, at least, Hard to Be a God's vision resembles Bela Tarr's.  It takes pleasure in its bleakness, its inhumanism, its nihilism, and its disgust.

The Middle Ages (though not that era alone) would have called this contemptus mundi, contempt of the world.  But that view was meant to be a corrective to the world's attractions and pleasures in the light of the death that inevitably would come.  Feel contempt for the world in order to be saved not by the world, through one's delight and joy in it, but from it and thereby find paradise.  But in works like Hard to Be a God that contempt is more nearly the only source of its art.  It is neither profound theology or philosophy, which is, as expounded in the movie, naive at best.  Contempt is not to be seen as a means but as an end.  It is a film that wallows in that contempt, that shows it without cessation for two and a half hours.  It is a vision of an intense and compelling sort, no doubt, but it is one that I reject because of its obvious limitations.  In its singleness of concentration it leaves out too much and thereby becomes monotonous very quickly.  There is something not just physically appalling but morally ugly in a movie which is disgusted by everything except itself.

A side note:  early in the film and again more lengthily at the end, what is ostensibly an antique instrument plays a riff that sounds like a sax playing a solo in a jazz club late at night, all smoky room and clinking glasses.  It sounds nothing like medieval music.  What is it doing in this movie?",1437004800,11,4542,4.5594059405940595

Like no film you have ever seen this one will be a chore to watch but whom delivers such succulent squalor amid muck and mire you have to respect their efforts. Toss down the coin and ready oneself to venture into a world never known before. Think the middle ages w/o color, extra nasty and mean. Expect a lot of wooden collars tethered to chains is more the common fashion of their culture.

It's generally just painful to watch.
You can tell just by the camera work that it's the worst kind of ""art film"", made by a typical arts person who shouldn't touch other people's work with a ten foot pole lest he pollutes it. Or, as they say in Russia, perhaps write ""for the drawer"".

8710181,1,B00VHAG1DW,"I'm a fan of dark, arty, and/or medieval films, and this was recommended to me after I praised Valhalla Rising (one of my favorites), so I went into this expecting to enjoy it. Instead, this film ranks as my biggest waste of time and money for as along as I can remember. Again, I'm fine with experimental films, and I love gritty, realistic portrayals of ancient/medieval life (see also Valhalla Rising, which I mentioned earlier), not to mention dark humor.

The problem with this film, though, is that it literally has no plot. Seriously. Oh, I know the synopsis SAYS it has a plot, but that's a trick. In reality, this is basically just a seemingly endless series of scenes depicting mud and snot, with a poor attempt at dark humor thrown in. There's very little dialog or character development. In fact, the synopsis presented in the film's advertisement isn't even remotely depicted in the actual film. If you watched this film without reading the synopsis, you'd have no real idea that there are scientists on an alien world, and just think you're watching some pretentious film student's attempt at reminding you how really gross medieval life was.

Put another way, one does not get the impression that there's a point behind any of this, nor is there really any discernible consistent symbolism. I'm fine with experimental films, as I said, but in my view, shock value purely for the sake of shock value, with no other point driving it, is a waste of time. Worse, it actually amounts to a form of artistic bullying. Watching this film made me angry, but not in a way that was even remotely enlightening or instructive. I generally don't like to speak negatively of other people's art but in this case, as much as I hate to say it, I honestly didn't see anything redeemable.",1512691200,2,1783,4.711538461538462

8710186,3,B00VHAG1DW,"One of the more frustrating films you'll ever see, HARD TO BE A GOD is a Russian-language depiction of Dark Ages filth and inhumanity that refuses to conform to anything so traditional as character and plot. Director German creates a tableau of mankind at its most base, locating the story on another planet than Earth, but he makes no attempt to differentiate it from Earth of the worst medieval, pre-industrial time. Visiting this world to study it, Earth scientist/researcher Don Rumata is treated like a lord by the rabble of his village. Yet the Don himself still has to live in the same fetid conditions as everyone else, and clearly it is driving him insane. (By ""fetid,"" in comparison, this film makes the settings of MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL and JABBERWOCKY look positively antiseptic.) While this premise might sound interesting, the dialogue is so fractured and confusing, the story unraveling so slowly and obliquely, the entire exercise only serves to make the viewer agitated. Visually striking, the film creates a disturbingly claustrophobic atmosphere; sweat and spit and snot and feces and faces and fingers and hanging corpses of both human and animal crowd the frame for attention. HTBAG might just turn out to be one of the most infuriating three hours at the movies you'll ever spend.",1498521600,,1312,4.995433789954338
