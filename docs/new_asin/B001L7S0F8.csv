3681725,5,B001L7S0F8,"On the contrary of many vocalists who actually span the billboard and try to be faithful to certain rules of the changelling market, Janis Joplin emerged from the low depths of her not so beloved Texas to become the most legendary rock female singer the world still remembers, despite of the fact four decades had elapsed.

Her irreverent attitude on the stage, as well as her unavoidable compromise of thinking and acting in the same direction made of her a true icon for that generation so tired of being deceived and betrayed.

Janis Joplin's inextinguishable energy, untamed display of unlimited passion for she was doing were perhaps the key clues to understand why she gave herself in every concert the one thousand percent.

This DVD captures her essence as human being with her untiring devotion for being listened through the heartrending lyrics that certainly revealed the supreme necessity of being loved, appreciated and respected as human being.

During more than five generations, her image has crossed the frontiers of the fashionable singers to become a cult icon, such prominent figures of the past in jazz such as Billie Holliday or Edith Piaff in the French song book.

Janis a singer who lived and died according and for the blues.",1313107200,9,1251,4.966507177033493
3681726,4,B001L7S0F8,"This is some outstanding live footage of Janis performing with her last two bands, after she had left the Big Brother & the Holding Company Band.
This dvd includes interviews with Dick Cavett, and live performances. These are some of the last filmed Janis Joplin performances, before her untimely, early death.

This dvd continues the life of Janis, after she left the Big Brother & The Holding Company. So, this dvd takes up from where the dvd ""Big Brother & the Holding Company with Janis"" ends. Both are great dvd's.

The performances in this dvd are as follows:

The Kozmic Blues Band: (This band included trumpets & a saxaphone player).
""To Love Somebody""
""Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)""

The Full Tilt Boogie Band: (This is a more traditional  blues-rock band without horns):
""Move Over""
""Get It While You Can""
""Half Moon""
""My Baby""

The ""Full Tilt Boogie Band"" is the band that Janis recorded her big hit ""Me and Bobbie McGee"" with.

The performances are outstanding, you get to see Janis in a different way than she is in the Big Brother & The Holding Company with Janis Joplin dvd. Plus, Janis gives great interviews, she is very candid, funny, and sincere. You get the feeling, she really wanted to find a man to love, but couldn't. Anyway, this is a great dvd, especially for serious Janis fans, and I do recommend it. Thanks!!!! (Oh by the way, the one I have has dvd sleeve notes in Portuguese, but that really doesn't cause a problem). Thanks!!!",1241654400,32,1460,4.657587548638133

8317497,3,B001L7S0F8,"Janis Joplin's three Dick Cavett appearances. Janis' performance is brilliant. However, this is a crappy south american made bootleg DVD. It looks like they copied it off youtube. The picture is cut off at the bottom. Sound is good but however they mastered it, it doesn't fit correctly on a TV screen. Save your money and watch it for free on YouTube.",1425859200,,352,4.693548387096774

8317499,2,B001L7S0F8,A bit of a let down. Quite a bit on the generic side. I would not recommend this TimeLife rip off. It belongs on the shelves of your local Dollar Store.,1391212800,,152,3.935483870967742
8317500,4,B001L7S0F8,"Bought this DVD for my Janis collection. Picture quality is not perfect, plus the subtitles are not removable, so they take away from the product quality. But loved not having to buy the Cavett DVD boxed set to get just the Janis programs. I'd say buy only if you're a hard core Janis fan like me....",1380672000,,300,4.375
8317501,1,B001L7S0F8,There is nothing new here.  Just a poor quality rehash of Dick Cavett interviews which you can get from buying Dick Cavett interviews DVD.  Very disappointing.  Waste of money.,1380585600,3,176,5.0
