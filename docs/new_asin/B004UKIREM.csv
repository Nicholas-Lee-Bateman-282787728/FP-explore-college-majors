8617703,1,B004UKIREM,"Buyer beware... DVD is good quality but made in China.  If you are learning Japanese or speak no Japanese and need subtitles, DO NOT GET THIS DVD... because the English subtitles seem to be done by a Chinese native speaker using Chinese subtitles.  As a result, the English subtitles are impossible.  90% of Japanese names are rendered in Chinese and the subtitles are grammatically structured like Chinese.  Other Japanese DVDs from this SELLER have good subtitles... although some Japanese TV Series have good subtitles, I have experienced one Series where the final episode was as bad as this DVD and made no sense whatever... so it is a bit of a ""crap shoot""... Obviously... there is no product QA done by the Chinese Manufacturer.... leading me to believe that they are ripping off the content... and don't really care about quality...  surprisingly the DVDs are packaged very professionally and the video quality is excellent... so if you are fluent in Japanese, they are a good buy.  But if you need subtitles, buyer beware...",1321574400,,1033,4.942196531791907
