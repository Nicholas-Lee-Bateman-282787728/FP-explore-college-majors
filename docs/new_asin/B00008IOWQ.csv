8593823,5,B00008IOWQ,"We are a family of six, ranging in ages from 2 to 43, who loves sharing music together, all kinds of music.  We have all watched the video, listened to the CD, and attended the musical performances of the Laughing Pizza threesome numerous times.  It is always a thoroughly enjoyable experience for all of us.
This is one of the few family entertainment groups out there who can keep our little ones, teens, and adults all interested and singing along. And there is so much more to come from them. I highly recommend this for all families and especially suggest a trip to one of their performances. They are a magical team and lots of fun to watch.",1047859200,2,647,4.47457627118644
