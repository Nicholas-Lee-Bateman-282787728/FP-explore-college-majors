3037181,4,B000Z27H7M,"I'm so happy to have stumbled onto this film.

It's not much of a story.  An elderly man wants to donate his large home to the Russian Orthodox Church so that it may be used as a monastery.  He wants to do this so that he has done something 'enduring' with his life.  Meanwhile the Church has sent a couple nuns to check the place out before agreeing to accept the property.  They point out some expensive repairs that need to be made (leaky roof, inadequate furnace).  It's all quite reasonable.

But this old fellow is such a defeatist about everything.  He is admirably open and honest, but he has such an ""all is lost"" attitude.  Although he inadvertantly brings cheer to those of us watching him, I don't think he himself smiled once during the entire film.  He's quite a character.

Although the film is marketed as collision between strong personalities, no anger is ever expressed.  Both the nun and the old man are always civil with each other.  Indeed they seem to have a fondness for each other.

I felt happier after watching this gentle film.  That alone is worth at least 4 stars.",1285977600,,1094,4.510204081632653

3037183,5,B000Z27H7M,"This is one of those rare documentary films that surely took an unexpected twist -- deftly captured by an obviously very sensitive and insightful film producer.  It probably did start out as a documentary about an eccentric old fellow donating a dilapidated Danish manor house to a ""foreign"" church, but it became something very different.

The real dilapidated house is Mr. Vig's noble old soul.  An academic and former cleric, in a way, he lost much of his faith along the way. One suspects his less than happy relations with others, especially women, in his earlier years had something to do with that.  With the help of a determined nun, pious, strong willed, tenacious, and sensible, Mr. Vig realizes a dream of establishing a Monastery, and the dream becomes a reality and his own pathway to salvation.

In his struggle with a nun, himself, his past, and his own doubts, he finds faith, and lives faith again.  The scene of him and the nun walking in a holy procession around their embryonic convent is a powerful expression of Mr. Vig's spiritual rebirth.  Yes, the two protagonists argue, endure each other, work together, come to love one another dearly, and in the end, they walk together in faith.

Through a denomination itself only recovering from decades of suffering, the soul of a fine old fellow, whose faith had been sorely diminished over time, was given a breath of life again -- just like his crumbling house which is now priceless in a sense because it has been transformed into something incomparably more valuable than an investment property. It is a remarkable story of spiritual rebirth against the odds.

What a wonderful story, and a wonderful surprise it must have been for the film makers.  And to think, it was a documentary.  What does carefully scripted drama have that real life doesn't easily best?",1210723200,7,1833,4.842948717948718
3037184,2,B000Z27H7M,"I am not exactly sure about the point of this documentary, about the establishing of a Russian monastery in Denmark by an older, and very eccentric, landowner. The film itself, as a work of documentation, I feel leaves much to be desired. It is incomplete. Perhaps other viewers will find this to be part of its charm. For me, I felt it was part of its annoyance.

In the end it was a study of a man who has always played it safe and never risked loving anyone, raised by an abusive father and submissive but loving mother. His obsession with outward physical traits (noses and ears) kept him from dating, and so he was a priest (RC Protestant?) and a librarian. In spite of his general dislike of humanity, he still wants to establish some sort of permanent tribute in the world with the founding of a monastery. That said, even almost against himself it seems, he still gives the nuns this amazing castle and to his credit his dream was fulfilled.

In the end I was left feeling very sorry for him (may his memory be eternal), loving the strong-willed but correct Mother Amvrosia and praying to God that I would live my life a little nicer and thoughtfully. I am also left wondering what it is exactly that turns a person into a misanthrope. Small degrees of turning away from love, I suppose.

As a note, a reader thought I was too judgemental here, so I want to post my reply here for you in case you do not read the comments section: ""It is nice to see interest, either way, since it is a film worth watching. However, I am not sure where you read me passing judgment upon Mr. Vig. If I am not mistaken, and correct me where I am wrong, eveything I wrote is exactly what he says in the film about himself. If it is wrong to accurately summarize the content of a film in my own review of the film, including my reaction to it, then i guess i misunderstand the point of reviewing anything. Should I gloss over the main character traits of the main character in the story? Perhaps you feel uncomfrotable viewing with honesty the tortured life of Mr. Vig. Perhaps not. Only God knows his end, and that is only between the two of them, but we can only go with what the film, and he himself, presents to us. This ambiguity toward love and care on Mr. Vig's part, even his resistance to it, is what is haunting to me and what serves as a warning, not any sort of stone casting. May his memory be eternal.""",1209859200,12,2403,4.323725055432372
3037185,3,B000Z27H7M,"Director Pernille Rose Gronkjaer's ""The Monastery"" is a curious film.  Ostensibly, it's the story of the conflict between an octogenarian (Mr. Vig) whose dream of transforming his castle into a monastery turns stale when the dream meets reality in the form of Sister Ambrosija.  But the documentary is too impressionistic to let the viewer enter into the conflict on more than a superficial level.  While we learn a bit about Mr. Vig, Sister Ambrosija remains a total mystery.  We know nothing about her background nor her dreams.  She's Vig's bete noire, but an almost totally anonymous one.  We also come to know almost nothing about the documentary's ""star,"" the castle itself.  Although we accompany Mr. Vig through various parts of the huge structure--the basement, the attic, a couple of rooms--we never get a good feel for the castle as a whole.  So both human and architectural characters are underdeveloped.

Okay.  So perhaps we have to look for a less ostensible, deeper point to the film.  Could director Gronkjaer's purpose be to suggest that even our most fondly held dreams fall short when we try to achieve them?  Is the point that many of us, like Mr. Vig, are capable of sacrifice only up to a certain point, and that beyond that we'll cling tenaciously to physical and emotional possessions?  Is the film trying to suggest that institutionalized religion (in this case Russian Orthodoxy) is necessarily hierarchical and bound to rankle individualists/loners like Mr. Vig?  I dunno.  The film is no more clear in a presentation of a deep, underlying theme than in its portrait of Mr. Vig and Sister Ambrosija.

Ultimately, then, what we have in ""The Monastery"" is a sketch of an eccentric curmudgeon whose hope to found a spiritual retreat spirals into conflict.  By the end of the film, Mr. Vig is petulantly shouting at Sister Ambrosija:  ""You ruin everything!"", and Sister Ambrosija patronizingly, mockingly replying:  ""Why are you crying, Mr. Vig?""  But, not surprisingly, the intensity of their dislike for one another is unexpected and contextless.  One moment they're mildly annoying one another, and the next they're screaming at one another.

The packaging and ""plot"" description seem to hint at ""romance"" which is so horribly misguided for this film.  It's really a lovely character study of a very old hermetic man who has hardly ever had to collaborate or even care about anyone else in his life, but he has this vision of starting a monastery and simply does whatever it takes to make it happen - despite his age and ignorance.  In this way it's very much like a Herzog film without the soundtrack and the drama.  I really grew quite fond of Mr. Vig as the film went on and was charmed by watching him simply rummaging through the building, attempting the impossible, whether it be moving a rug or fixing a boiler.  This may not sound very exciting (which is obviously not he point of this film) but it was quite charming, sweetly amusing, and really heartwarming in the best way - never pushing for ""drama"" but simply letting a real-life story unfold.

While the closing statement by the nun certainly strikes a spiritual message, the rest of the documentary drags, was minimally religious, and therefore, was not fulfilling.

The standout in this film is the Russian Orthodox nun.  It was beautiful to see the clarity, wisdom, joyfulness, strength, discipline and bravery that a person of God has.

As an Orthodox Christian, I wanted more Orthodoxy.  Bricks, leaks and financial issues can only go so far...what was most important is what was taking place within Mr. Vig spiritually.  What made him want to do this?  That question, the most important one, the one that could have given this film spiritual depth, was never answered.",1386892800,2,1153,4.927461139896373
8234608,5,B000Z27H7M,"The Monastery, Mr Vig and the Nun is a superb documentary by Pernille Rose Gronkjaer,which depicts a lonely old man who's never been loved or known love,a retired parish priest, lecturer and theologian,about to donate his broken down castle to the Russian Orthodox Church to make a monastery,before he shuffles off this mortal coil. The film recalls another documentary Grey Gardens,of a house in need of repair for its eccentric denizens. As there, there seems an agreement among the film- maker,subjects and audience to act as if the presence of the camera does not alter the recorded event. The director is gently in the background,asking one or two questions, of the deeply eccentric Dane,who is stubborn with his neck beard and awkward gait. The film shows how direct cinema attempts to directly capture reality,by questioning the nature of reality with cinema. Mr Vig,a Scrooge-like figure out of Hans Christian Andersen,in meeting Sister Amvrosia,a headstrong nun,realizes charity and good will are not simple,as the heating system and the roof are totally overhauled and repaired to meet Sister Ambrosia's exacting demands for the nuns who must live in the monastery. Mr Vig was close to his father,and is a perfectionist about people's noses!

Mr Vig in his eighties has worked on this project for 40 years for the old castle keep deep in the Danish woods. His noble gesture is not the end, but the place needs work and lots of it. There is a battle of wills between Mr Vig and Sister Amvrosia,despite the evident affection and love. Heartwarming without being sentimental. Filmed during 6 years. Sister Amvrosija, a powerful nun who's not afraid to lay the hammer down. Together, they live in the castle and work to make it a place suitable for worship. The pair squabbles about the extent of the damage and bickers over the cost of the repairs. They sound like a married couple, except Sister Amvrosija is married to Jesus and Mr. Vig is married to solitude. But they are charming people full of character and good intentions. Shot on a handheld video camera, it peeks into every corner of the castle and shows just how massive such a place is for an old man. The camera stays on the people long enough to give us a sense not only of what they are doing, but exactly how and why they are doing it. There is no narration, just dialogue from the people and the occasional question from the director to dig deeper into their motivations. The story moves visually and Grnkjr does very well to let the situation tell the story. The image and sound are both adequate for the film, but neither has a lot to do.

Gronkjaer's cinematography is pleasing, with beautiful sunsets and tranquil snowscapes. This is a wonderful little film, a delightful portrait of two very different characters, and in some ways a meditation on the nature of faith and desire. The relationship between Ambrosija and Vig is difficult, touching, messy. The Monastery is a source of conflict, of shared dreams, a place of misunderstanding and frustrated destinies. A testament, a monument,to God's work here on Earth.",1379030400,,3095,4.88212927756654

It still managed to capture the emotional experience of the main character with him  being frustrated in dealing with the nun and losing control over the situation as well as the loss of the the control of his expectations and his original good intentions.

I got into sharing his frustration, but it seemed as if something was missing as all circumstances couldn't have been captured due to reality of life, and was slow moving for the same reason.
