4674732,5,B005FISBV2,"The sixth Season of DEXTER is now two episodes old and the changes in the writing and casting are remarkable. Dexter's on is now two years old and is gaining in significance to his father's thought processes.  There are some interesting suggestions that this season will explore the opposite side of dark - the world of faith and 'religion' will be part of the running stories.  Already there is a new 'team' of fellow travelers in the serial killing industry in the characters played by Edward James Olmos and Colin Hanks.  Lt. Maria LaGuerta (Lauren Vlez), now divorced from Sgt. Angel Batista (David Zayas), has become a Captain, Dexter' sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) has a falling out with Quinn (Desmond Harrington) and becomes the new Lieutenant, taking LaGuerta's old spot, and Dexter (Michael C. Hall), though a bit more thoughtful than in previous seasons, continues to perform his serial rituals, aided by his ghost father's (James Remar) guidance.

There are enough subplots established in these first two episodes to make for another fascinating season.  Dexter returns, just a bit different, but still challenging our senses!  Stay tuned. Grady Harp, October 11",1318204800,23,1178,5.141361256544503

4674791,3,B005FISBV2,"Watch out for spoilers.

Alas, the implausibility chickens come home to roost with a vengeance in this season.  Indeed, Dexter has spanned the arch from high drama to melodrama all the way to gripping soap opera chock full of cliff-hanging moments that remind one of the silent westerns with the damsel tied to the train tracks while we see the smokestack puffing in the distance.  This became clear by having to bring a friend up to date on the plot twists of the episodes I saw that she missed; you hear them spoken and they are sillier than heck and make you laugh out loud.

This season Dex is up against the Doomsday Killer (DDK, played with wooden rigidity by Edward James Olmos), a religious fanatic determined to bring about End Times by enacting just the right biblical tableaux all of which involve pageantry but especially lots of retributive gore.

By now the implausibilities have multiplied into impossibilities.  Why are his victims suddenly unable to speak just because Dex inserts a small cotton wad into their mouths?  Why is that taped band around the forehead so loose it jiggles for some victims and has others straining just to keep it from falling off?  Why does Dex often skip the band entirely and get so close to his victims face for his final tte--tte that one wonder why an angry serial killer with nothing left to lose doesnt bit his nose off?  How can Dex make his bodies merge into the Atlantic Ocean when they are weighted down with rocks and will sink to the bottom of wherever he dumps them and not be carried off by the Gulf Stream?  And worst of all, the haunting memory of the MPD's crack detectives looking for an in-house Bay Harbor Butcher -- a serial killer who uses a boat to dump his victims in the Bay -- and pinning them on Sgt. James Doakes, who does not own a boat while Dexter does (and Dexter docks his in one of the areas from which the BHB is known to operate).  Oops.

And how does DDK stage the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse  with parts of a corpse strung together with mannequin parts to be the riders  on a downtown Miami street without being noticed?  Where he did get the horses?  How did he do this unnoticed?  Where could he keep them for a couple days?  How does he let them loose without anyone noticing until its all done?  How does he get away?  Only one of these questions is answered explicitly: (A: He stole them from a stable.)  We learn that the DDK hides out in an abandoned church in a suburb of Miami 16 miles from town but when we see the church it is surrounded by an active family park which presumably helps answer another question: carefree Floridians were too busy playing Frisbee to notice, and no wonder nobody else ever went into the church  no bathrooms.

Then theres the great scene where Dexter presumptively frees DDKs assistant, the good-hearted Travis Marshall whom Dex tried to put back onto the righteous path, causing the rift with DDK that led to Travis current predicament.  Travis is shackled to a chain slipped through a grate in the church floor.  The shackles consist of chain wrapped tightly around his wrists secured by padlocks.  No matter.  Dex shoves a table in his direction, Travis pulls some chain over it, Dex swings a mighty axe and splits the chain  which of course leaves the shackled wrists that cant be freed by axe.  No matter.  Travis fiddles a Houdini split-second behind the table and poof! hes free.  But that means he had the keys all along.  What!?! Take it again from the top, but not in this heart-clenching series.

And sister Debra?  After she shoots and kills some scum-bag she is ordered into mandatory PTSD-prevention psychotherapy where she discovers, mirabile dictu!, that she has been making s***ty choices in men all her life because they are unlike the man she really truly romantically loves, her adoptive brother Dexter.  So, heart in hand Deb goes on the hunt for the escaped DDK who just happens to be on Dexs killing slab at the abandoned church in the family park, and she comes in just as Dex does the deed.  How will this affect things, you wonder?  Stay tuned for Season 7: the choo-choo train cometh.",1459468800,,4140,4.568521031207599

4674853,5,B005FISBV2,"In this season, the concept of God is explored in context to Dexter's serial killing/super-villain fighting.  Dexter, as we well know is an atheist with no ability to connect with the rest of humanity.  Everything he does is an act, the act of a sociopath.

This series explores the hand of God in violence, and perhaps, evil.  There is a new super-villian, ""DDK"" or Doomsday Killers.  These are Dr. Gellar (Edward James Olmos) and his top student  Travis Marshall (Colin Hanks).  The relationship between the pair ends up having an interesting twist and that twist continues the excellent, suspense filled writing that makes up the series.  While the DDK is clearly carrying out murder based on religious fanaticism, the series explores other aspects of faith as it closes out the plotline with the Trinity Killer.

We know that the Trinity Killer was also religious, but his religion was really a mask for Trinity's serial killing ways.  We also meet Brother Sam (Mos Def) who is a repentant convict who is initially suspected to be a killer, but turns out to have a genuine faith and a genuine repentance.  Frankly, I was hoping that this reverend would turn out to be killed as the character grated on me at first, but as usual, the writing and character development is quite good and Brother Sam's death at the hands of one of his trusted associates is genuinely sad.

The final scene of the series gives an excellent seasonal cliffhanger.",1430956800,,1444,4.801619433198381

When I try to explain the series to people who have never seen it, I describe him as a loveable mild-mannered vigilante-type serial killer who is very protective over those he cares about.

4675086,3,B005FISBV2,"Showtime has always been the crassest and most obnoxious of all the premium cable channels, which isn't saying much, because they all are. Same with the major studios. I must have wasted a week of my life sitting through FBI warnings and useless promos.

I'm pretty late watching Dexter, so I'm surprised I've gotten through six seasons without running into any spoilers, Even the one Showtime put front and center on this boxed set. I found this to be the weakest and most implausible season of Dexter yet, but the last ten seconds of the finale totally blew me out of the water. Showtime did not spoil it for me. Here's how:

I learned years ago never to watch episode recaps that are frequently run before the show. This is because if an element or a character from a previous show returns, which is usually supposed to be a surprise, the recap will hint at it by including a clip of something from past episodes that is relevant, so the viewers with short-attention spans will remember and not get confused should a particular character or conflict return unexpectedly. As a writer, these clips often get my brain working, and I'll frequently find myself subconsciously trying to figure out , for example, why events from season 4 could possibly still be relevant in season 6. Sometimes I guess right, spoiling it for myself. Either way, it takes the thrill out of any dramatic development. This is why I avoid movie trailers, recaps of past episodes for ANY tv show, and most importantly, the desperate, insulting, hastily constructed dreck that pollutes the pre-menu content of just about any DVD or Blu-Ray (as a side note, I find it insufferably annoying that after close to twenty years of DVDs, the studios finally eased up on the ""hey this is a DVD you're watching!"" crap that went along with the heinous self promotion of the material and/or studio. Now just about every time I put in a Blu-Ray, there it is again: ""Blu-Ray technology! You're watching high definition!!!!"" Please. Yes I know it's high def. But so is TV and everything else. I've come to believe that people who work in advertising are just one rung above serial killers (Mr. Morgan not included) and pedophiles on the ladder of humanity)

SHOWTIME COULD NOT RUIN THE ENTIRE SEASON FOR ME BECAUSE I SIMPLY REFUSE TO WATCH THE CRAP THEY THINK THEY'RE MAKING YOU WATCH. I'll load the DVD, but leave the TV off until I'm sure the menu has started to cycle. Sometimes I'll switch the input, mute it, or simply leave the room to grab a beer or something.

Just because a disc opens with a bunch of garbage that you can't skip, scan through, or sometimes even stop doesn't mean you have to be a prisoner on your own couch and sit through it.",1400716800,,2713,4.634095634095634

4675122,5,B005FISBV2,Another great season of Dexter. Pins and needles! I was on edge the whole time. If you haven't seen it you must.,1394236800,,112,4.136363636363637
4675123,3,B005FISBV2,"I was very amazed on how fast the item shipped, there was only one day between when I placed the order and when the order was delivered.

Upon ""unboxing"" this item, I was a little disappointed, as the item I purchased was listed as new, was actually shrinkwraped and in a shape that is clearly recognizable as used, there were scuff marks on the casing and the paper inserts on the DVD cases them selfs had been shifted around (Looks that way to me). Fortunately, the DVDs are functionally, they are readable from my laptop, PS3, and my native home Blu-Ray/DVD player.

This season is probably the best season of Dexter I've ever seen (yet, I'm watching the series in order), as Dexter gets ready to enroll his son Harrison into his Catholic pre-school, he is faced with a question ""What do you believe in?"", from the way I see it, this is what the season revolves around this time. With the arrival of a new killer, acting out the Book of Revelations, and spreading the word that the end is near. Accordingly, this killer is named the Doomsday Killer, as Dexter searches for the killer, he find help from Travis Marshall, former student of Mr. Gellar, and now his apprentice, they plan to end the world, and start a new one, and leave everyone to suffer to what is ""Hell on Earth""

NOTE: I'm an avid watcher of big TV series, Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, etc.... and there is a plot twist in Season 6 that even I didn't see coming, and I can usually predict a lot of things in TV shows.

There is a massive spoiler in the 2 minute preview of the shows that appear on SHOWTIME, and there is a preview from the LAST SECONDS OF SEASON 6, if you can I would recommend watching this TV series on Netflix to not only avoid spoilers, but save money.

All in all, I did watch enjoy Season 6, and the package that came was less then exceptional, but functional. I would by from this seller again, but not any DVDs.",1394150400,,1922,4.372549019607843

AMAZON should be able to see if you have fully watched an episode or not so they can refund your money for something you haven't seen. Just my opinion.

The whining and cloying and constant drama of a homicide lieutenant such as this, I don't care about the writers giving her an F-bomb in every line. I'm sorry. but not only is she obnoxius, she has no talent in the acting area. Maybe something else behind the camera, but not in front. Please, not that! The next time that I see her in anything... well, I don't want to even think about it. On the other hand, these Dexter yokels (casting people) can't find anything further for the nanny who played Catherine of Aragon so sweepingly in the Tudors. Are you kidding me? In a story that makes Dexter look like John, Jean and Judy... Hey genius, give her Deb's job.

4675226,3,B005FISBV2,"The story and the acting are outstanding enough to earn five stars. A realistic story about a serial killer who channels his ""dark passenger"" for constructive and even heroic purposes is more than enough to hold anybody's interest. They also have first-rate actors (e.g. John Lithgow as the Trinity killer, and Edward James Olmos in Season 6).

 I must, however, demote it two steps because of Showtime's disrespect for customers. The DVD locks out your player's control, and will not allow you to stop, switch to disc menu, or fast forward through Showtime's advertising. If I wanted to watch advertising, I would watch commercial television and not pay for a DVD.

Is a two step demotion really in order? As a quality professional, I know that a problem that a customer remembers can absolutely ruin the customer's perception of an otherwise top-rate product--sort of like finding a dead insect in a gourmet meal at a five-star restaurant. This is the situation here.

My solution is simply to put the DVD into the player several minutes before I plan to watch it. [...] adds that pressing Stop, Stop, and Play (or ""Stop"" three times followed by Play) will circumvent the problem, but maybe not for all DVD players. What is really needed is a DVD player that will simply ignore the disk's programming to deal with this issue.",1386720000,,1327,4.832599118942731

4675276,3,B005FISBV2,"This is probably the most formulaic of Dexter's 8 season run, and while still enjoyable on an episode-to-episode basis, the overall story of this season is somewhat weak and unsatisfying.  The Trinity Killer is a tough act to follow, and introducing another ""gimmick"" killer this soon after Trinity was a bad idea.  Trinity was psychologically grounded, realistic, unpredictable, unstable, and terrifying.  The Doomsday Killer however felt like a contrived attempt to go back to the ice-truck killer story line (down to the exact sort of music and camerawork every time Dexter came upon the next tableau).  This killer's convoluted plan and crime scene was just a little too far fetched.  Besides, there was absolutely no suspense because the audience, unlike the religious doomsday killer, knew 100% that butchering a few dozen Miami citizens would NOT lead to the end of the world.  His ultimately thread was without any bite whatsoever.

Moreover, I just don't buy that Dexter got this invested in spiritual exploration. I could see his friendship with Brother Sam being realistic enough, because Dexter does want to lose his Dark Passenger and be a normal human being. and Sam represents the opportunity for real and persisting redemption.  I could see Dexter connecting to him.  I suppose its possible Dexter, as a person who can't appreciate some of the ""soft"" beliefs humans in the world use, might be intrigued by this external belief system if he thought it could lead him to redemption, but I don't know - even if there was potential for the idea it just wasn't executed very well.

My biggest gripe, however, is that the show just stopped advancing.  As long as you know that Deb gets promoted to Sgt., and you see the last 2 minutes of the season, then you know everything you need to know to understand season 7.  Although Dexter has always been more isolated from episode to episode than a lot of other premium cable series, I think at 6 seasons the audience wants the show to start addressing the central conflicts of the show (will Dexter get found out / will we see some ACTUAL AND PERMANENT change in Dexter).  Well, there is woefully little of that this season.

I will say that Deb was a more likable and relatable character than ever before in this season, and I genuinely did enjoy her arc.  All and all, this is the weakest season of the show, mostly because it tries to copy-cat elements of past seasons that were successful rather than try to push the show towards a satisfying ending.  It feels contrived at times, and while still enjoyable, this show is absolutely not necessary viewing anymore.",1380499200,2,2622,4.832214765100671

Deb is a hard -nosed, no nonsense detective, she would have a highly developed sense of morality and I can tell you as someone who was adopted with an adopted sister, you don't fall in love with your sister after it's revealed that she was really adopted, if you're a normal person. Hello, Deb is supposed to be the NORMAL sibling in this relationship...right? You expect weird and abnormal behavior from Dexter, he's a psychopath after all, but I mean COME ON! Besides that disgusting and illogical plot twist, I thought the writing and directing was weak in season 6. I felt none of the suspense or creepiness that typified the earlier seasons, which I LOVED. Colin Hanks is a good actor, but he lacks the gravitas to carry off the complex emotions that were needed to bring off the DDK killer, I just didn't buy it.

I get that Dexter is a Showtime show and that you might like other Showtime shows ( there are some I think would be interesting, but not to buy on dvds now), but that they made it impossible to skip to the show you bought and want to watch makes me mad and not want to buy/watch any of their other programs.

There's plenty of comments about the way the DVDs are formatted - it's horrible, and I don't feel the need to elaborate any more on that, except to say it was a huge error.

Overall, we decided there's something just missing in the entire season.  The characters seem stiff, the writing doesn't flow the same previous shows have, and we suspected some changes in the writing/production.  On checking with IMDB there has been a big change with writers on the show, some new blood in, a lot of original writers out.  And for this reason, maybe, we can see a difference in the ""feel"" of the production.  There's also a couple of new directors too for this season, also why maybe the camera angles and the small nuances that we have come to take for granted as a part of the character of the series as much as the acting.  We tried buying into the new ""baddies"" but can't.  The ""Intern"" gets as much screen time as Angel Batista and Masuka!  And there's not been much suspense at all.

We would say that if this had been the first series of Dexter, we're not sure it would have had such a great following.  Instead of buying this season, we wish we'd just borrowed it from someone.  It's not one we will watch again, and will be happy to lend this to someone else.

""Dexter"" is pretty gory and definitely R rated, but I love the show and the bits of humor that are thrown in!",1370131200,,571,3.982456140350877

4675410,5,B005FISBV2,"As Dexter tries to balance his life of being a single parent with channeling his dark passenger, he begins to feel the overwhelming stress and becomes a little reckless. Despite warnings of caution by his late father Harry, Dexter plunges ahead to find and destroy the Doomsday Killers, who try to bring about the end of the world by re-enacting literally the tableaus found in the Book of Revelation..
I have been hooked on Dexter since I received Season 1 as a gift this past summer and have been devouring each seaon to catch up to the finale of Season 8. I have been pulled in by each of the characters and their strengths and weaknesses. I now see Dexter's dark passenger taking on a bigger role, as Michael c. Hall demonstrates so well in his acting and facial expressions. I worry about Deborah, going forward, how she handles the challenges she faces.
I have recommended Dexter to everyone I know, but it is not for the squeamish!!",1370131200,,939,4.595238095238095

Completely ruined the season for me.  Thanks Showtime.  Besides, this really was kind of a lame season anyways.  My least favorite so far.  Maybe I'm just getting tired of the story.  I really did like this show a LOT before.",1369958400,2,366,4.388059701492537
4675415,4,B005FISBV2,"The way it was written and presented clashes with how most of the previous seasons were staged. Without spoiling anything, too much of the season's primary story arc is right in your face, and it massively deflates what could have been a much stronger story otherwise. Put simply, they show too much and they tell too much, and far too soon. The viewer is privy to information that they shouldn't be for the sake of a cheap fake-out later on in the season.

Not my favorite season, but it's still a great run regardless. The best part is definitely how the season ended.",1369958400,,570,4.533980582524272

4675423,5,B005FISBV2,"Dexter season six was in my viewpoint much better then season four and five because I enjoyed the storyline for this whole season of Dexter.  People have said this is the religious season of Dexter and that he is looking for answers to many questions that he is pondering.  But as normal for me I will give you guys and ladies highlights and a few spoilers of the season six.  Season starts off with a bang with Dexter killing people, then is called to a crime scene and they have to open up the victim to see what is inside his stomache(buy the season to see for yourselves).  Debs personal life gets in way of her work after she is offered a promotion to boss.  Musuka gets a helper for this season and he proves to be up to no good (have to buy the season to see what I mean).  The cops get a lead on the religious killers going on the book of revlations and refer to as doomsday killers, Dexter ask God for a favor for his son.  Dexter starts to figure out the names of the killers and tries to hunt them down, Sam gives Dexter advice on how to let go of the darkness within his heart and try to forgive.  Dexter listens to the advice of Sam and forgives himself for the death of his brother Rudy.  Sam leaves Dexter his Bible and Dexter starts to read it looking for answers, then he finds a lead and goes to an old church to find the killers.  Deb making headway in theorpy and Dexter figures out the next victim of the killers, as season goes on Dexter fixes out Travis is working alone and the other killer is already dead.  Travis tries to send in a follower to do God's will, then Travis tries to kill Dexter in a religious mannor called the Lake of Fire but of course he survies.  Travis comes up with a final plan to do the sacrifice unless Dexter stops him,  he of course finds Travis and they fight then Dexter takes Travis to the church and choices to do what he does best to bad people, only one thing goes horribly wrong(you have to buy the season six DVD set to find out).  But speaking bluntly it's a hell of a cliffhanger my mouth dropped open.  What did it for me was all the religious stuff because I am Catholic and enjoy many aspects of the Bible and it's teachings.  Also forget about the bad reviews because of the intro on the DVD set if you truly love the show Dexter watch this season with an open mind and you will be blown away as much as I was and still enjoy every season of Dexter even the ones I gave four star ratings to because you have to look at the season as a whole not just each episode.  I was very pleased with this season can't wait to buy season seven when I have some extra money.",1369094400,,2627,4.1196078431372545
4675424,4,B005FISBV2,"I have no idea why I love this series!  he is a blood splatter analyst with Miami PD and his sister is the trash-mouthed but very effective Homocide Lt.  She catches the bad guys but if the justice system doesn't properly deal with them, he re-catches and kills them.  There is no reason for this to have become so addictive, but somehow it did.  There were some terrible twists to the story in last year's season and I am concerned about how they will tie up the storylines...but I just can't stop watching!
Now, about the DVDs themselves:  I took the set to a friend's house so he could see what I have been talking about.  Neither of the first 2 (out of 4) would play on his machine.  DVD #3 did play, though, and he says he understands my fascination with the series.
I brought them home with me, thinking I would have to return at least the ones that wouldn't play - but decided to test them at home and they worked perfectly.  So, I guess the moral of the story is that not all DVD players are equal.
If you have never seen the show, I would recommend you watch it at least once (it's on Showtime, Netfix, and probably Hulu) to see how you can like a serial killer!!",1369008000,,1172,4.2242152466367715
4675425,5,B005FISBV2,"After reading all of the reviews about the 2 minute ""Showtime Promo"" at the beginning and making sure not to read any spoilers, I ordered the season six Blu-ray. I figured that I would somehow avoid it when it popped up. As it turned out, my luck had changed. There was ""NO"" promo, nothing. It just went straight to the menu. I didn't look for spec features or anything I just watched every minute of every episode. I thank everyone for warning me and especially thank those that complained enough to the powers that be. It worked. I got to watch the season. After the final scene I almost called 911 because I actually had an extremely serious panic attack, anxiety attack or even a minor heart attack. Not to mention the fact that I needed to change drawers. Thanks for making it so I could actually enjoy the season finale. Tomorrow night I begin watching season 7 and have not read anything about it so nothing can spoil it for me. Season six truly was the return of Dexter, worth 5 times what I paid for it. Now with the anticipation of the season 7 1st episode raising my blood pressure, I am wondering how I am going to deal with the end of season 7 and then the end of season 8 which will be the end of Dexter. No show or movie has ever gotten to me like this and I hope one day there will be something to being as well written, acted and produced. One can dream, right? I am glad that I do not have Showtime right now because I like being able to just watch it when I want, as many times as I want. Michael C Hall is one of the few that have taken chances with their career choices, from Kissing men to killing them. Like Christopher Meloni, running around a prison naked kissing and well, uhem guys to arresting them as Stabler and saving the world as an animated Green Lantern. Then there's Jake G.

How a father and blood spatter analyst can become a (bad guy) serial killer has created a most interesting character portrayal. The series grabs your attention and will not let go.

This is a creepy story about a serial killer, so if you are not interested in violence or crime shows, this is not the show for you.  I think the acting is very solid, and although I can't take the bloody scenes, I enjoy this series very much.

We had a problem with the first set sent to us not playing properly, but the replacement that Amazon sent works fine.  I think they may be using cheaper disks these days, because we've been having problems with several other DVDs lately, too.",1365552000,,737,4.228571428571429

4675492,3,B005FISBV2,"I should start off by saying that this is a great season of Dexter in which we get to see a lot of development out of all of the characters. I particularly like the dynamic between good and evil, how Dexter deals with light and dark and how Dexter struggles to contend with things that seem to be higher than himself. It's an interesting season that definitely shouldn't be missed for any Dexter fans.
SO now on to the DVD review itself. I have been a huge fan of Dexter since season one. It always feels great to get the latest season and add it to my shelf like Dexter adds slides to his box. However I have noticed a trend with the DVD box sets that is just too big to ignore. The quality. Don't get me wrong, I am not a guy that has to have HD picture or even Blu Ray for everything, I am perfectly content with a good old fashioned regular DVD but this season's picture quality is quite frankly atrocious. It's pixelated and dark to the point that I can't even tell what some smaller objects even are. I don't know who did a quality check on this but they need to seriously find a new job. The plastic is cheap and flimsier than it has ever been and that's saying quite a bit because they have always used the smaller cases for each season but this is the first time I have had one just break one use.  The special features are sub par but really they have never had interesting features on their DVDs. I wish I could say that this was the fault of the 3rd party vendor I bought it from on Amazon but unfortunately the season was SEALED when I got it so there was no way for the 3rd party vendor to tamper with it unless they are just seriously good at making it look factory sealed,which I doubt. I am seriously surprised that anyone from Showtime, CBS DVD or Paramount had the gumption to put their name on this poorly executed box set and quite frankly they should be ashamed for such a serious slip in quality.
I am just hoping that in the future they will decide to put a bit more time and effort in to giving me a quality product instead of just shoving the DVD out there and trying to rip me off.",1365206400,,2108,4.1414634146341465

It was very disappointing, since I am a big Dexter fan and was really looking forward to having the sixth season. I don't know how the DVD's were produced, but it was a very poor work, probably a copy from a faulty master.

Also, I hate those individuals who complain about how evil he is and what a murderer he is.  Well of course he's a murderer and a murderer you would want on your side when someone does something wrong to one of your loved ones; unless you would have the balls and intelligence to do it yourself.....No, I didn't think so!!

I think we Dexter-ites (Dexter-philes?) would hate to see him go to jail, or even get caught, but we know it's going to have to end, sometime, somehow.",1364169600,,469,4.295454545454546

Like I said, Dexter gets a big thumbs up from me, I love the show.  This DVD set leaves much to be desired.  So disappointing to watch the end scenes of THIS season in an ad at the beginning of the DVDs.  An ad that cannot be skipped, cannot be forwarded through.
I had been warned about it so I tried my best to turn on the DVD, mute the TV and turn away or go in the other room for a while until it was ""safe"" to look.  What a hassle when you just want to watch the show! And it didn't quite work for me. I glanced at the TV too soon one time.  Giant spoiler!

I turned the volume down and walked away for a few minutes until the ad was over!! If had not of been for the other reviews, the ending would have been spoiled for me as well, and I HATE spoilers!!

I would say that Colin Hanks is the major fault with this season (his father can act, he definitely cannot).  But more than that the story line is forced and trite, like the authors were desperate to integrate religion.

Overall the season was interesting and engaging with some pretty good character development on the part of Dexter and Debra.

The overall plot arc for the season was solid as well, but I will say that this season isn't getting 5 stars from me because I really disliked the actor who plays the season's serial killer (not Edward James Olmos, he was great). I haven't had a chance to look up who he is but I really didn't care for him at all.

4675790,3,B005FISBV2,"While the first five seasons were nail-biting and thought-provoking at every turn, season six is an unqualified letdown in many ways.

The twist that occurs shortly after the half-way point is so obvious and predictable that even a viewer unacquainted with crime dramas could see it coming miles away. The chief antagonist is hardly interesting (Dexter without rules, with several lengthy psycho-babble terms applied to his dossier), and the gore and viscera that are displayed make it look like the creators wanted to distract viewers from the poor writing and utter lack of introspection. This tactic was ultimately doomed to failure, as Dexter wastes an entire episode extending a storyline that played itself out in the early days of season five. We would have been better entertained (and the world of the show would have been better served) if the bulk of the episode was focused on Debra and her new responsibilities and revelations that she was forced to come to terms with during season five's climax.

The side characters have become more of a sideshow. Quinn becomes a bumbling alcoholic, Angel Batista returns to clobbering anyone who looks at him the wrong way, and LaGuerta and Matthews are largely absent for the most part. With the dullest villain imaginable, this leaves little for fans of any character (although Masuka always delivers on the black/sick/filthy comedy front). The early scenes with Dexter's school reunion and his disposal of a serial killer who has entered Geriatric Land are entertaining, and leads to perhaps the most profound epiphany that Dexter learns regarding Harrison, his late-night hobby and himself.

Overall, however, this season went off the rails, and was a disappointing cul-de-sac after five seasons of psychological introspection.",1358726400,,1783,5.249122807017544

4675806,5,B005FISBV2,"I've always loved crime stories, so this show is right up my alley.  (I also worked in a correctional center as a nurse. for 8 yrs. in the Forensics Unit where I saw many of the horrible murderers that some of deep down secretly wish we had a Dexter roaming around).  Dexter has never failed to entertain me since season one. No, we've never seen him cut up a body, but we see time and time where he makes a cut on his victim's face to have just enough blood to put it a vial and hide behind his air conditioner in his apt.  If you don't know Dexter, I'll give you a very short look into his life.  As a child he witneseses the brutal murder of his own Mother.  The cop who finds him crying in a puddle of his Mom's blood adopts him into his family.  He has a sister.  She later becomes a tough cop and Dexter becomes an expert on blood analysis from murder scenes and works for the same police department.  He's had murderous thoughts since his Mother's death.  When he sees some much of the scum of the earth getting away with murder, he decides to step in and do justice on his own without mercy.  The writer's of this show have done a wonderful job of taking us through a journey of ""they got what they deserved"", all the way with us cheering on the likeable murderer.  There are some very serious changes in Dexter's life and that keeps us wanting more and more of Dexter.",1358294400,,1377,4.178030303030303

4675810,4,B005FISBV2,"First, Showtime's use of promos and unwillingness to avoid spoilers is inexcusable.  I recently caught up with this series on DVD (since I'm not a Showtime subscriber), but before I even started, I saw the Season 7 promos on another channel that revealed the big twist at the end of Season 6.  If there was any doubt remaining in my mind, seeing the cover of the Season 7 DVD only confirmed what I had already had spoiled.

And it's really too bad because entertainment-wise, I found this to be one of the better overall seasons of Dexter...similar to the excellent Season 4 in many ways (guest star serial killer pursued, Dexter lets him get away several times struggling with his own issues, finally takes care of business, but then an absolute shocker in the last 5 minutes of the season throws the entire series in doubt again).

To the people who say that Season 6 was very lazy in plot at times, I really have no defense to that.  What I would say is that ""leaps of faith"" have ALWAYS been required of the fanbase.  This is not a procedural police drama.  For example, it's not ""The Wire"".  But if you accept Dexter for what it is, it can be the funniest, most creative, and scariest show you'll watch, often within the course of a single episode.

I thought that Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos were decently compelling guest stars, certainly more compelling than Julia Stiles' performance of Season 5, which I was not a fan of.  And the conclusion sets up a HUGE cliffhanger for Season 7.  But Showtime really needs to cool it with the obsessive promos, ""previously on"", and ""next time on"" bits, which might help casual fans, but also tend to spoil much of the plot.",1358208000,,1677,4.538205980066445

In this day and age, it is easy to find any film or TV show for free online -- so why penalize paying customers by making them watch a commercial?  And not just once -- the commercial is on every disc and will play every time you insert the DVD. (The whole concept of commercials is that they fund free entertainment such as network TV. In this case, you pay for the entertainment and then get to listen to Showtime beg for your subscription dollar.)  Plus, including a spoiler in the commercial borders on PR-suicide.

Character development also was very good, with Quinn being lost, La Guerta tied to Matthews, Debra as Lieutnatn, Dexter taking care of Harrison, Batista and his sister. Only Vince Masuka I think did not get enough screen time. The new guy from Chicago was also a good addition to the cast.

Anyway, I could not miss any show that had Bill Adama in its cast!",1357430400,,449,4.6

4675960,4,B005FISBV2,"One of these days Showtime will get it right when it comes to new Blu-ray releases for ""Dexter"". The sixth season of ""Dexter"", as with the previous ones, may have a formula but that formula allows the writers/directors/producers and actors to continue to develop the characters in new and interesting directions for the show.

There are marked changes for Dexter Morgan, his sister and his co-workers face some changes (a particularly big change that signals a change in direction for the series in season seven)with the latest season. Featuring Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos, the acting from regulars to the guest stars continue to be terrific.

SPOILERS:

With the sixth season Dexter faces the Doomsday Killers (Olmos and Hanks)two men who are trying to bring about the end of the world by recreating key moments from the book of Relevations. Along the way, Deb Morgan finds herself unexpectantly promoted and dropped right in the middle of a scandal involving a high ranking officer.

END OF SPOILERS:

The sixth season starts off really good (although, if you're sharp you'll be able to spot the twist in this season by the third episode)but by the last third the show comes across as a pale imitation of previous seasons with twists and turns that indicate, perhaps, that the writers were running out of ideas. What keeps the rest of the season fun to watch are the performances from the regulars as well as the guest stars all of whom are top notch. The premise for this season is exceptional it's just that the execution is a bit shakey. Still, for fans of ""Dexter"", the show will still be essential viewing.

The Blu-ray transfer looks great with a sharp, detailed and colorful look to the show. The blacks are rock solid throughout so if you're looking to buy the Blu-ray the advantage is the nicely done transfer for the series.

The lossless audio likewise sounds terrific.

Where Showtime continues to fail is in the area of special features. Some people could care less about special features but they do matter to me. There are no commentary tracks and all the special features are only available via BD-Live. The interviews are pretty decent featuring Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, Lauren Velez, C. S. Lee, Colin Hanks and Desmond Harrington. WHY they don't have any featurettes on the productin of this season, shooting of various episodes, etc. is beyond me. It's cheap and doesn't reflect well on Showtime.

The inclusion of episodes for other shows I probably wouldn't watch isn't all that big a loss (and I really don't consider the special features) but, given that's all that's really included, it would be NICE if it was actually on the Blu-ray disc. I don't uses BD-Live all that much anymore and, to be quite honest, to go on to view the episodes is a pain. Of course, the interviews and episodes (two each) of ""Californication"", ""The Borgias"" and ""House of Lies"" ARE included on the DVD. So, if you want special features and want to pay a little less (and can settle for DVD vs. Blu-ray high def quality), you may want to get the less expensive DVD.

Recommmended even if once again Showtime drops the ball in terms of special features (again) and the season, as a whole, isn't quite as strong as what came before.",1357344000,,3253,4.772241992882562

I'd recommend NOT watching any of the snippets because they show (at least for Dexter) scenes from future episodes.

4675976,4,B005FISBV2,"- Brother Sam: ""If you put your faith in the wrong thing, it can really ef you up."" (except Brother Sam didn't say ""ef"")

DEXTER's Season Six gives you the awesome and gives you the suck. I do feel that this is the weakest season in the series. Not that I'll ever stop tuning in; I'm addicted to this show. Only, I'd never seen Edward James Olmos sleepwalk thru a role before. Even Steven Wright thinks Olmos is too understated.

Catching up with our favorite serial killer: All is well in Dexter Morgan's corner of the world. He's moving on from his wife's bloody murder and from Lumen's abandoning him. He's very much a caring single parent - his kid's two now - and his job as blood spatter analyst at Miami Metro PD is fulfilling. And then there's his hobby... he hasn't given up gratifying his Dark Passenger. But Dexter's got his s*** together. As Season Six opens, he's off to attend his 20-year high school reunion. There, he busts a move to M.C. Hammer and plays flag football. He even gets lucky. But who're we kidding? Dexter is attending his high school reunion to target his next victim. Life is good for the Bay Harbor Butcher.

This is the season wherein Dexter starts exploring religion. The charismatic Mos Def plays Brother Sam, murderous ex-con turned man-of-the-cloth who walks into Dexter's life and befriends him. Dexter is initially skeptical and dismissive and even targets him as a potential kill. But there's something about Brother Sam. Has he really turned a new leaf? Can he teach Dexter about the nature of faith? Mos Def turns in a mesmerizing performance. Even as Dexter seeks religious enlightenment, Miami Metro PD's Homicide Division investigates a series of grotesque killings that immediately assumes biblical connotations. How long before Dexter's spiritual quest collides with the Doomsday Killer's apocalyptic mission?

This show has always been deliberately messy, but, yikes, the creep factor is off the chain this season. It's hard to pin down Colin Hanks' character. He's uneasy in his own skin. He's at war with himself, his reasoning self versus his very own Dark Passenger. However, I found myself wanting to skip ahead whenever the camera shifts to his and Olmos' narrative. Their dialogue is so heavy-handed. They just don't measure up to the show's past villains. Lithgow has set such lofty standards, it's ridiculous. Even Jimmy Smits from Season 3 brought a more commanding presence.

Okay, off the top of my head, the unsatisfying stuff (and there's quite a bit): I didn't like that Louis the intern's arc never really goes anywhere. We have to wait until Season 7 for that to play out. In fact, even the blonde intern's arc pretty much fizzled early in the season. And ***Mild SPOILERS*** now for the rest of this paragraph: I wasn't buying it when the detectives insisted on waiting for Dexter before entering a crime scene. This allowed Dexter to be the first to step into the room in which the Doomsday Killer had drawn Dexter's likeness on a mural painting of the Devil. Needless to say, Dexter promptly made some cosmetic changes. With a hammer.

And it's convenient, isn't it, that Angel Batista's sister had moved in next door to Dexter, this making it easier for Dexter to land a babysitter anytime he had to step out?

And then there's that shift in Dexter and Deb's relationship, predominantly from Deb's perspective. It's a stunning revelation and it's cheapening. It undermines what has been a constant strength of the show: Dexter and Deb as a dysfunctional brother and sister pair who screws up a lot but nevertheless cares deeply for each other. This monumental reveal feels a bit insulting, as if the writers all of a sudden determined that the preexisting family dynamics weren't enough to anchor the show. That, more than anything else, is what's disappointing.

I think whenever religion is introduced as a central theme, there's a concern that the tone may take on a certain heavy-handedness. Again, the scenes between Hanks and Olmos did nothing for me. There's also that telegraphed and pretty played-out plot twist concerning Olmos.

I do like that Deb's arc plants her and the self-promoting LaGuerta more firmly in the spotlight. I love Jennifer Carpenter's rawness, her evocation of a broken but resilient woman. David Zayas is solid as Batista. He projects quiet reserves of strength. The show's weak link,Desmond Harrington's Detective Quinn, continues to be the poster boy for super-bland bad boys. C.S. Lee's lecherous Masuka keeps making me laugh. Michael C. Hall keeps doing the improbable, making his serial killer a lovable character. His inner monologues continue to make for a fascinating listen.

Other folks had already mentioned this, but here it is one more time, just in case... Be aware that each of the 4 discs starts with a 2-minute promo that showcases several Showtime programs. Be aware that you cannot fast forward thru this promo or skip ahead to the menu. About a minute in, this promo reveals the shocking last scene of Season 6's final episode. It's a moment that fans had long been salivating for, and it just about salvages the entire season for me, a season which, by the way, feels more like a set-up for the next season. But now here's me backing down. As critical as I've been, I still love this show, love the cast, love the premise, love the final episode's jaw-dropping closing moment. So, 3.5 out of 5 stars for DEXTER Season 6.

Anyway, the 12 episodes are on 4 discs, with Disc 4 containing these following bonus features:

- Interviews with Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, Lauren Velez, C.S. Lee, Colin Hanks, and Desmond Harrington
- Text Biographies
- Photo Gallery

First I want to say that I was lucky to get this on Instant Video so I didn't have the DVD problem others had where Showtime gave away the ending in the show previews.  But I was thankful to be warned about that ahead of time in case it had happened.  So if you get the DVD, shut off the show previews so you don't have the end spoiled for you because this season is incredible.

I've watched all of the seasons of Dexter up to Season 6 which I just finished.  I don't have Showtime so I always rent the DVDs but couldn't find this one anywhere so ended up buying it and I'm so glad I did because it is one I will want to watch again.  Intense, Exciting, Surprising, Exceptional.

4676112,4,B005FISBV2,"I watched Season 6 as streaming content on Amazon, not as DVDs, so my review only has to do with the content of the show.

I watched the first few seasons of Dexter, but grew tired of the series and some of the characters by Season 4.  The finale of that season hooked me back in (Rita's death).  I loved Season 5 and couldn't resist another season, so I watched 6 all the way through.

This season is still very good.  Dexter's psychological (and spiritual) development continues, and other characters are evolving nicely (particularly Deb, who seems stronger in a leadership role as lieutenant).  The characters' complex relationships with one another is still one of the most engaging aspects of the show.

On the negative side, the episodes felt drawn out, as if the writers were simply trying to take an idea and stretch it out into a full season's worth of content.  I found myself getting bored and restless by season's end.  Nevertheless, the finale is a real doozy (rivals Season 4's finale in terms of ""wow"").

If you are a Dexter fan, you have to watch Season 6.  It may leave you with some mixed feelings about some of the story lines, but there's no doubt that Dexter is still one of the best shows on television.",1356566400,,1226,4.552511415525114

4676192,5,B005FISBV2,Ok. Im a huge fan of this show.  I bought season 5 first....had to keep going until I have them all. Got season 2 here.....just ordered seasons 1 and 4 yesterday....4 shipped supposed to get it soon. Anyway.....I watch this show in a different style than everybody else. Because in my opinion every episode can stand on its own.  Whether its just one victim he gets....or its his complicated life.  I watch it that style. Ill watch say an episode from season 5...then watch one from another season.  Ok....on to my point.....they probaly did that to preview season 7.  There are ways around it.  Ill write another review to tell you how.  Im personaly looking forward to getting this set.  Once I see it Ill review it. I promise. But please no more complaints....even though they are beyond justified.,1355961600,,801,4.712230215827338

4676210,2,B005FISBV2,"(Spoiler) Well after Season 5, I was really sad to see Lumin go but I was happy for her.  In this season every disk has a giant Showtime add you have to sit through on every disk which is really annoying.  I thought the benefit of buying the show on DVD over renting is that you would be spared of that but with this season it is not the case.  Also in the preview they show the ending of this season which I also really hate.  Yes, on disk one they show you Dexter stabbing the main Jesus freak in a church and his sister catching him.  This made watching the whole season a lot more dull than it already was.  The word god and Jesus are said so many times you can make a drinking game out of it.  I felt like the season was not well written.  Maybe I would have not cared as much if Seasons 4 and 5 were not so amazing but they were and this one kinda bit.  (Spoiler) The big bad is a skinny white boy (Tom Hanks's son) who seems too wooden to me a crazed killer to me.  I really felt he was miscast.  Maybe that was the point, to have someone who did not seem like a killer to be one but I still did not like the style of acting he brought to the role. His big plan is to make art out of dead people that will bring about the rapture.  It does not make a lot of sense.  I love the idea of a killer that makes art from dead people but strapping a bunch of body parts to horses to look the the horsemen of the apocalypse is not the same as them actually showing up. Honestly you can just play the scenes between the main characters and skip the whole plot line with the bad guy and move on to season 7.  Nothing in this season really matters save the end witch actually you see at the start.",1355616000,,1692,3.8950437317784257

The plot of Season 6 starts out with so much potential and truly reels you in only to get bogged down in poorly written plot points and predictable resolutions half way through. For a show whose past season have made me gasp, Season 6 made me ask, ""Really? How has this show become so predictable? None of this makes sense.""

While there were things to enjoy overall (the work of Edward James Olmos is always interesting even when he's constrained by weak material) but I found myself feeling increasingly annoyed with (a) a weak villain, (b) the mildly icky Dexter-Deb incest theme, and (c) the total implausibility of how Dexter manages to just 'take off and leave' day or night without anyone raising questions or holding him to account.

For those of you who do not know what this means, think of the best possible picture you can get from a dvd and then think of smearing your tv screen with vaseline and watching it.

This is such a travesty, and an assault on people who like the series.  I'm beginning to think ROLLING STONE was right when they said ""UOP killed the DVD""  -- at least in instances like this where it's so misused.  My advice is to NOT buy this set but rather wait to rent it from Netflix or get it from your local library.

4676345,4,B005FISBV2,"I am soooo conflicted. I was so mad at Dexter (the character, that is) at the end of Season 4. Then in Season 5, they resolved nothing!!! Then I found out they had renewed it to Season 8! I was like, what the heck. How long can this possibly go on? Dexter has got to get caught sometime. Well, this season kind of redeemed itself.

My problem is still that Dexter does not seem to be following his ""code"" anymore. He is not going after killers who fell through the cracks. He is purposely messing up police investigations and crime scenes just so he can get to the killer first! The big issue is... what happens when the killer just disappears? I guess the cops just forget they'd been working on the case for months and move onto the next one, right? And no closure for any victims. That's how it all happened before.

Well, despite that, something about this show was fascinating enough that I watched all 12 episodes in 2 days, even though Dexter's technique made me furious. Even though I hate unnecessary sex and language (and this show really overdoes it), I am addicted to this show. (Showtime: just because you CAN do it doesn't mean you HAVE to.) The thing I liked best about this season was that Dexter finally seemed to be finding a new path in life. Not that it went that well. I'm not religious myself, but it sure was an interesting direction for the show and the character!

Like I said, I am so conflicted. Sometimes I love this show, and sometimes it just infuriates me. I've been borrowing it from the library and I keep changing my mind about whether I want my own copies. (Maybe this will be the one set I can buy the complete collection of all at once.) One thing is for sure: after the way this season ended, we at least know Season 7 will have a purpose.

P.S. After reading some other reviews, I sure am glad I am in the habit of sticking the DVD in my player while I leave the room to get my dinner. I cannot believe they put a spoiler to the ending in their shameful Showtime promotion! (I was already irritated with their un-fast-forward-able previews from previous seasons, so luckily I didn't accidentally see it on any of the discs.) And the ending was a surprise.

I like the secondary characters,especially foul mouthed Deborah, and Matsuka(sic).

The plot does the normal twists and turns, with Dex tracking a pair of killers who see the end of the world coming according to the bible and act out scenes from the text as a warning to all--ending to that seems illogical to me, but OK.

Best part of season is the end--it is a shocker, and I wonder how it resolves itself this new season!

I will say that this was the season that 'Dexter' officially jumped the shark.  There are some glimmers of interesting character dynamics, and even an unexpected twist, but overall the plot is overwrought, the acting is hamfisted (everyone has this 'here we go again' tone to their delivery) and the whole show have become tired and predictable.  Yeah, we get it, LaGuerta is evil, Deb is nosey, Joey is a drunk, Batista is a goody-good, etc.  We've seen this stuff played out over and over.  Why are we watching a makeout session between two new characters, and even then, its just an intern and a babysitter?  Fluff stuff.  I'd prefer my 'Dexter' in 90 minute doses a la 'Sherlock'.

Well, the writers for season 6 have managed all of the above and more. I was very pleased with season 6 and as usual was left wanting more.

That's not the only problem with the authoring.  Unlike some (but not all) of the other seasons, you cannot skip through the recap and opening credits by using the skip forward button.  Instead of taking you to the actual beginning of the episode, it jumps you 5-10 minutes into it.

Worst DVD authoring in the history of DVD authoring.

4676454,1,B005FISBV2,"I am in total agreement with other reviewers who were angry about Showtime's HORRIBLE promotional montage at the start of each and every disc in this 4-DVD set. I am not a fan of network montages to begin with (they're just tacky and overly-obvious and as a consumer I don't get much out of them) but usually you can skip past them and get to the menu of the show you're watching, no biggie.

Not this time.

For some reason, Showtime and/or the DVD manufacturers decided to bake the Showtime promo into their menu in such a way that there is no way to skip it -- you can't fast-forward, you can't skip to ""next"", you can't go to Menu, and you can't even hit ""stop"" and then start again to get to the Menu functions.  That sucks.  As a consumer THE VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY LAST THING I WANT IS NO CONTROL OVER MY VIEWING EXPERIENCE.

I had planned to give this a DVD a decent review, the four or five stars it deserved on content alone. But then I saw that other customers had blasted it for the DVD menu, and since the real reason I wanted to review this disc was because I wanted to complain about the forced montage viewing, I realized that an ""unfair"" one-star review was more appropriate: this is a protest vote. If DVD sales are impacted by these low, negative reviews, and if that's what it takes to get Showtime's attention, so be it.

Dear Showtime: if you have a good product -- a well-written, well-produced, well-acted show -- then people will buy it. But if you treat customers like babies and force them to watch lame promotional videos that NO ONE WANTS TO SEE, then you will alienate your fans. I am a fan. I like DVDs, not downloads. But if in the future every Showtime series has a forced-viewing feature like this, you will lose my business. Just saying. (Axton)",1352764800,3,1780,4.378787878787879

4676603,4,B005FISBV2,"This season Dexter's serial killer is obsessed with bringing on the end of the world.
His methodology is to create events from the Book of Revelation thereby causing the end of the world.
This season is pregnant with questions of faith, God and forgiveness.  The result is a dark forbidding story striped of almost all comedic overtones.
The light-hearted ""oh my god, this shouldn't be funny but it is"" comedy series is gone.

The replacement is a dramatic series with philosophic overtones allowing for more character interactions and developments.
Debra is moving from a plot device to a real character with her own issues.
Angel is less likable as a bully quashing his little sister's romance.
Quinn is spiraling downward toward his total destruction.
LaGuerta is slipping from a political backstabber into a full blown criminal willing to do anything for a promotion or an advantage.
Brother Sam, who finds God in prison, goes from Dexter's potential target to showing Dexter to true faith and forgiveness.
His influence may be Dexter's redemption and expel the ""dark passenger"".
Brother Sam's real Christian faith is the counter to the Doomsday Killer's mistaken ideas that can make faith toxic.

Dexter always has excellent casting and acting.  Season six continues that with no false notes.  Even the smallest parts are believable and look right.
Overall, while seasons five and six go in a different direction from seasons one to four the series is worth watching with interesting characters and fresh stories.
This is why the series is in its' seventh season.

Showtime put a commercial on each of the DVDs in this set.  My machine was forced to play the commercial each time I started a DVD.
Additionally, it is the same commercial on each DVD in the set.  You will be forced to watch the commercial a minimum of four times.  It feels as if I watched it a thousand times.",1351296000,,1881,4.889937106918239

Series aside, the DVD collection is what one should expect.  I wanted more behind the scenes and extras, and perhaps it's on the BluRay, but there's very little on the DVD besides the shows themselves.

A note to Showtime/CBS.  Can we get an option to Play All and have it skip the openings and Previous on Dexter?  That'd be really nice.",1349827200,,471,4.626506024096385
4676752,2,B005FISBV2,"Easily the worst season.

Enough red herrings to keep a fishmonger busy indefinitely, the season chronicles the hunt for DDK or ""The Doomsday Killer"".

Tom Hanks' son Colin is wonderful as a religious nerd psychopath Travis Marshall, who resembles many of the players on the PGA tour and is linked to a doomsday prophet professor from the University of Tallahassee.

The early episodes are spot on, fun and freaky and setting the tone nicely while introducing an ex-con who got religion, excellently portrayed by rapper Mos Def.

Unfortunately, this effective set-up unravels with the unbelievably absurd promotion of Deb Morgan to lieutenant (a foul-mouthed, grossly unprofessional loose cannon with not enough years under her country and western belt to make such a rank) and an even more unbelievably absurd sexual tension between Ms Morgan and brother Dexter.

Dexter, rather than the meticulous killer we've come to know over the previous 5 seasons, takes a slapdash approach to his work, leaving bodies everywhere it seems.

The cheesy 80s action flick trope of kidnapping the protagonist's son, is trotted out and Dexter whisks a body out of a high rise building's top floor in broad daylight without a soul noticing.

Sloppy, corny and wasting a terrific first few episodes.",1349827200,7,1282,5.164251207729468
4676753,2,B005FISBV2,"The original Dexter killed those that had escaped the legal system, making the best of his dark passenger. This evolved to where there were circumstances where he had to kill the killer to protect his identity or where he delayed in order to learn from another serial killer. That is all gone in this season. Dexter chooses to suppress evidence because he _wants_ get to the killer before the police.

The Colin Hanks character is an inadequate villain, both in what the script gave Hanks to work with and what he brought to it. The character isn't interesting -- he lacks intensity and smarts, and didn't even rise to the level of ""the banality of evil"".

The religious theme - the intended point-counterpoint for the season - is provided with neither the detail nor the conviction needed.

Missing are the clever twists and turns, although there are some wobbles. But mostly it is a tired procedural. I found multiple sections to be tedious. And too many elements that were repeated from earlier season apparently only out of inertia. And the new side plots ranged from insipid to annoying.

Too much of the plot depends on the characters doing stupid things and failing to take normal actions (details would be spoilers).

One of the underlying themes of the series is a highly dysfunctional person fighting to hide it and appear to be absolutely normal, with ""normal"" being counter-pointed by characters who are quirky (short of dysfunctional). This season has the Dexter character being the normal, well-adjusted, emotionally stable, responsible person surrounded by characters who are relentlessly dysfunctional. This might be the basis for a different series (a sitcom?), but it is not ""Dexter"".

""Dexter"" is about being clever and skewed, but this season was just hackneyed.

4676820,5,B005FISBV2,"** it is worth noting based on other reviews, I bought my copy in Australia and did not have any adds at beginning of each disk nor a spoiler showing the ending to the season **

Season four with Trinity and the death of Rita in the final scenes was gripping and high quality TV and set up what should have been an even better season five, but five turned out to be a big dissapointment.
But season six is right back on track and in my opinion the best season yet, at first it is a little daunting considdering the time gap between seasons 5 and 6, alot has changed between but when you considder this show is a 12 episode season and there are 52 weeks in a year and season 4 and 5 were continueous it makes sense to advance forward, do we really expect to be waiting 40 weeks between seasons and have everything exactly the same?

Between seasons dexter has found his balance between being a father and also feeding his dark passanger so is in some fine form
The main storyline of the season is the Doomsday killers and their murders based on the book of revolation and overall the whole season has strong religious undertones but not in a way that its forcing it down our throats nor being disrespectful to those who are religious, and the way Dexter disects his own thoughts and feelings and questions the merit of religion is intriguing and entertaining.

The doomsday killings are gory yet artistic and very twisted and for me a real highlight for the season, to be living in a city where these types of killings were happening would truely be terrifying.

There are some great twist and turns in this season, if you like your tv to be predictable maybe this season is not for you. and the season ending cliff hanger is truelly a holly s#@t! moment and leaves you desperately wanting to get straight into season 7

As far as the other charactor development goes everyone seems to move forward, Angel and Quin make an interesting and highly entertaining partnership especially with both dealing with major personal set backs and their behavior is certainly not professional, especially Quin who goes completely off the rails.
Debra struggles with her new found responsibility especially having to deal with more politics while having to take a backseat to investigating where she is at home.

4676874,3,B005FISBV2,"Season six of Dexter is getting rather tired.  We are dog tired of the gross, symbolic opening sequence that was amusing the first season or two, but it's been the same, no changes.

The basic formula of the show - where some bad guy in each episode is sleuthed out by Dexter, who eventually tracks him down and kills him in some ironic and justifiable fashion - is all but gone in this season, save the high school reunion scene at the beginning.

That leaves the story arc that spans each season, and is different for each one, and the story arc that spans the series.

Again, NO SPOILERS.

THIS SEASON'S STORY ARC

This season they brought in Edward James Olmos, who was magnificent in the reimagined Battlestar Galactica, but they didn't give him a lot of rope in this plot.  They brought in Tom Hanks' son Colin, who was pretty good as the leading bad guy, but didn't quite save the season.  And a plot about the Apocalypse (the end of days according to the Christian Bible), which done right can be intriguing and creepy, and at times it approached these.  But the plot didn't really hold up, and it kind of fizzled out at the end.

THE SERIES STORY ARC

The story arc spanning the series is the two halves of Dexter's life - home and work - which are not all that separable due to his sister working where he does, and this season, due to a hot new babysitter who is the sister of Batista.  Really?  She can make a living as a sitter?  But she IS hot.  The only possible explanation for Dexter resisting her is that it's not in the script.

Office politics plays a major role in the story for a change, particularly where they involve Debra (Dexter's sister), who is going through a lot of changes in the office, as well as taking up therapy.  She is learning a lot about herself and her relationship with her ""brother"", to whom she is not actually a blood relation.

And in the end, just as the Apocalypse finale sputters and fizzles out, we suddenly realize that it's this other story line that was the real point of this season after all.  Oh there were clues all along, but we did not see it coming.  We have seen cliffhangers in earlier seasons of Dexter resulting in potential changes in the series story arc, and this event may as well.

The question is, will this event be enough to reinvigorate the series?  Because to my way of thinking, season 4 - with Trinity - was the last really compelling series, and seasons five and six have been simply paying the dues.

BOTTOM LINE

Three Stars on Amazon means ""It's OK"".  It had its moments.  Some episides I would say ""I like it"", others not.",1348790400,,2604,4.395397489539749
4676875,4,B005FISBV2,"For starters, I accidentally stuck this review under season 7, so if you saw it there, it's been deleted to correct my mistake.

One thing that REALLY ticked me off, as it did a lot of viewers, was the 2 minutes of ShowTime BS that you have to watch first before you can watch Dexter, which to top it off had enough of Dexter season 6 in it to give away the ending.  Fortunately for me, as dumb luck would have it, I stick in a DVD and then to get to get snacks so that I don't have to sit through the commercials.  So if you buy it, please be aware of that.

On to a short review.

It's kind of hard to give a review for this season without giving away something, so this one will be short. I enjoyed it, but it felt like they changed directors or writers or something. Dexter's dad, whose been dead for some time, is at his side a great deal more this season. Also, what happens with Debra, his sister, seems out of character, but I can't say more without giving away something. The ending was really good though (BUT DO NOT SEE THE PREVIEWS PRIOR TO THE SHOW OR THE ENDING TO THE ENTIRE SEASON WILL BE GIVE AWAY), and you'll definitely go nuts waiting for season 7 to come out, like I am now.

I know that's kind of a mediocre review, but I hope that it helps someone. It is definitely worth watching and the only reason that I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars has to do with things that I can't talk about without giving away parts of the season, but I will say that I just didn't enjoy it as much as other seasons, until the ending.",1348617600,2,1533,4.042904290429043

4676951,5,B005FISBV2,I thought this season of Dexter was quite good.  I think if you are thinking about buying this then you already know what you want.  This season is much better than season 5.,1348185600,,174,4.242424242424242

4676953,3,B005FISBV2,"I have to wonder if my overall enjoyment of the latest season of Dexter was dampened thanks to spoilers that were made available online before this season even made its dvd/Blu-ray debut.  I won't spill the beans on the plot twists that lie in wait for viewers (if there are any out there who don't know what happens at this point), but I suspect that even if they were kept under wraps, it still wouldn't have been enough to keep season six from being the weakest batch of espisodes yet.

Relligion is a major theme as the city of Miami is terrorized by a duo of murderers known as The Doomsday Killers (Edward James Olmos, Colin Hanks) due to their religious zealotry and biblical themed killings.  Olmos and Hanks play teacher and pupil working together to stage murders that serve as tableaus of scenes from the Book of Revelations.  They believe that they are carrying out God's work which in this case is to prepare humanity for the end of the world.  Yet there is never a sense of urgency or fear to the crimes.  There is never a sense of city wide panic that is supposedly being caused by these crimes.  This is a crucial stumbling block since this poltline truly needs to provide an undercurrent of terror and suspense to the season.

Season six also stuffs some filler plotlines into the narrative that never really go anywhere.  Most notably, Dexter tracks down a geriatric former serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy.  In another less than satisfying plot development, Laguerta becomes involved in a political quagmire with her chief.  Again, it doesn't really add a lot to this season.

Still, there is a lot to like about this latest season.  The performances are strong as usual, with the exception of Hanks who feels woefully miscast.  Especially good is Jennifer Carpenter as Debra who has to deal with a lot this season including a breakup with Quinn and a prmotion to Lieutenant which comes with all sorts of political trappings. Mos Def is also exceptional as Brother Sam, a refomred convict who has devoted his life to God and tries to help Dexter come to terms with the darkness within him.  And of course, the season ends with one heck of a twist that sets up what will likely be the producers' end game.

No, season six is not perfect but it is still worth watching.  And it ends by leaving viewers with the hope that the momentum of that final scene will propel the series to a worthy conclusion.  That would make the shortcomings of this season all but forgotten.",1348099200,,2491,4.597285067873303

I was so angry that I hit the mute button and didn't even look at the screen until the coercion was over.  I spent that time (about 30 minutes total) vowing to never subscribe to Showtime, or buy any more DVD's from them (So the commercial was very effective after all).

4677009,2,B005FISBV2,"What is up with these big name shows ruining finales now a days.

Season 5 of Dexter was great, but the final episode was lame.

Season 6 picks up where season 5 left off, but I feel like the show in this season specifically is running on fumes. Most shows have lots of characters for the viewer to sustain interest, but the now, 6 seasons later, each episode, throughout the entire episode is Dexter, Dexter, Dexter. The other characters fall majorly behind in this season with the exception of his sister, but I was not a fan of the direction they decided to go with her. They turn this bad a$$ woman into a feeble little puppy dog who falls in love with....SAY WHAT!?!?!? It seemed very out of her character.

All the other characters and their personal lives do not shine. Theres really nothing to know, show, or even care about them.

Other than that, mostly all of the event of season 6 were very predictable. I easily guessed where they were going with this season by episode 2, but it took them 8 entire episodes to get to the point that I already knew by episode 2. I felt the whole season to be very dragged out, only to be ended with yet another major finale let down.

The only event that made the entire season worth it was the very last 3 seconds of season 6, but at the same time....why was she even there? Maybe they will explain that in season 7, but I'm not anxiously waiting for the next season after watching this one.

I'd recommend watching it for kicks, but it's definitely not on my lists of re-watches.

Hope this helps! =)",1347840000,,1548,4.354166666666667

4677012,4,B005FISBV2,"Dexter's sixth season is not the best season that they have produced. That said, it is still Dexter and that means that it is heads and tails better than anything else on TV.

We do not subscribe to Showtime so it is an annual tradition to buy the latest season every August and view it from beginning to end over a period of two days. This sixth season was no different and as enjoyable as ever. I cannot pretend to be a professional TV critic but I know what I like and this latest season of Dexter is, again, wonderfully sick and twisted. Michael C Hall IS Dexter and his ex wife who plays his ""'sister"" is equally talented. This latest season is a great place to invest your entertainment dollar as the entertainment value is built in. So--- here I sit waiting for next August so I can do it again.

Also- just as an aside- the Amazon price- especially for the Blu Ray version of this latest season is the lowest I've found anywhere. If you have ever been a Dexter fan, this latest season will not disappoint. If you've never been exposed to it----- where have you been?

4677015,4,B005FISBV2,"DEXTER's 6th season employs religion and redemption as its underlying theme, bringing Dexter's own feelings into unfamiliar territory.
This season is marred by inconsistency and the poor choice of casting Colin Hanks as the main villain.  Likewise, the decision to make Deb's love for Dexter more than sisterly seems shock value rather than a plausible storyline.  As for Tom Hanks offspring---Colin's performance lacks true menace or depth.  Edward James Olmos is wasted in his role as Hanks' mentor.  Rapper Mos is surprisingly effective as the ""redeemed"" Brother Sam.  Michael C. Hall as usual is superb, bringing incredible nuance to his complex anti-hero role.  Jennifer Carpenter has a great season as Deb, given marvelous opportunities to display her wide range of abilities.  Her lack of Emmy nominations is baffling.  Fellow cast regulars---Desmond Harrington, Lauren Valez, James Remar, CS Lee, Geoff Pierson and David Zayas---provide excellent support.  The ""return"" of the Icebox and Trinity killings seemed more like detours than necessary plot advancements.
Overall, a good season, not quite as engrossing as previous seasons.  Still looking forward to Season 7 and how the finale will play out.",1347753600,,1209,5.486486486486487
4677016,5,B005FISBV2,"This was an excellent season! Great writing, great acting. The end is so intense. And the fact that they play into a religious atmosphere is very intriguing.",1347753600,,157,4.851851851851852
4677047,5,B005FISBV2,"I have been a huge fan of DEXTER right from the beginning of the very first season.  It is a show that fully pulls you in and has a premise much deeper than the simple description of blood analyst by day/serial killer of those worthy by night.  This show really gets into the mind of Dexter and we get to fully understand how he became the way he, why he does what he does and also understand his reasonings.  DEXTER is one of the best shows out there  and though this season, the sixth, is not totally up to par with the better seasons, it is still better than most television out there.

The blu ray presentation here is amazing as all the seasons are.  The black/white ratio is excellent and colors are bright and vivid and pop.  Skin tone is very realistic and clarity is amazingly precise.  The darker scenes are just as vivid as the beautiful Florida scenery shots.  Add to the almost perfect 1080p video a Dolby Tru-HD 5.1 audio that is sublime and you have the best viewing experience possible.  Dexter's voice overs come out the speakers strong and present.  The rest of the dialogue is crisp and clear as well.  And surround speakers are put to great use here.  There is much action with season 6 and at the right moments all speakers are utilized for utmost effect.

My opinion on season 6 has changed greatly from my opinion after watching it air last season.  Upon first tv viewing I found the season a little lackluster but was totally enthralled by the character Brother Sam played by Mos Def and found the ending an excellent unexpected twist that definitely made the whole season make sense and also sets up season 7 expertly.  Season 6 is primarily about Dexter facing the issue of religion especially in regards to what he wants to teach his son Harrison.  The Doomsday Killer is the evil entity this season and with first viewing it didn't seem fully effective to me.  The first 8 episodes were fine but the next 3 seemed to loose steam before the final explosive excellent episode.  After a reviewing of the season on blu ray I now can honestly say everything about this season was excellent and it was all held together as always by the presence and superb acting of Michael C. Hall as Dexter.  The entire reason this season seems a little subpar is the casting.  DEXTER has always cast the perfect people from Jimmy Smits to John Lithgow.  Edward James Olmos and Colin Hanks just don't cut it here and the entire season is brought down a bit from it.  The story line of religion is a good one and it is handled well here as we see Dexter struggle with it.  Mos Def as Brother Sam brought a superb depth but the growing horror and suspense in the later episodes here totally lacked in true intensity due to Colin Hanks just not being able to handle the characterization he was given.  Luckily, Michael C. hall runs the show and each episode still rings true due to him.  Season 6 also has added emotional depth and intensity due to the welcome development of Debra, Dexter's sister played superbly by Jennifer Carpenter.  She has always been a major player in the show but this seasons her role becomes eve more complex and imoportant.

Bottom line, DEXTER is such a great show that each season will have much discussion of how it held up to the others.  Season 6, though not the best, is still great and is a must own for DEXTER fans.  And the blu ray is definitely the way to see it.  Highly recommended.",1347753600,,3428,4.463022508038585

 The silly unbelievable mistakes Dexter makes through out the season ; his running off to Nebraska;  the weird incest thing; to the freaky Dallas like "" it was a dream or hallucination episode"".

It's as if this seasons writers were starting from scratch and had not seen any of the previous episodes.
They had no insight at all into the serial killer/ perfectionist, attention to detail traits we have come to expect from Dexter.  Perhaps the writers are trying to give Dexter a more humane appearing psyche.  Dudes, it's not working.  And the whole Deb going into breakdown mode is lame as you can go.

Bring back Lumen for Dexter, give him his balls back.  Drop the weak spine-ed wish-washy Debbie and reintroduce the strong willed Harry's daughter Deborah we used to know.  The one who understood what was going on behind the plastic curtain.  My final suggestion, make the whole of season 6 including Deb's discovery the nightmare it really was and bring back the cool, collected, methodical Dexter we've come to love.",1347753600,,1054,4.832402234636872

I got burned on this same sort of advertising when they were promoting season 5 on TV when they showed how Season 4 ended (right after i purchased the Season 4 DVD).  My wife and I got the same canned response from Showtime about how it isn't their fault, which just goes to show you that they take no pride in the products they sell to us.  Maybe i should just call them up and ask them to tell me what happens in Season 7 so i don't have to worry about avoiding anything Dexter related until it comes out next year on video.

So somehow you imagine that you can achieve this goal by forcing purchasers of these DVDs to watch a 3 minute commercial for your various programs every time they run one of the disks.

Well, Showtime Networks, I have news for you. This tactic isn't gaining you a lot of fans. And telling folks it's actually Paramount who's responsible for how these DVDs are put together is disingenuous at best. (You may need to look up that big word. But it should not make you feel good about yourselves.)

Oh, yes, and it really was rather careless of you to include a major spoiler in the Dexter trailer. Now I suppose some viewers will be content to know what is going to happen and watch the 13 episodes out of curiosity for how the story gets from Point A to Point B. But most of them having watched seasons of Dexter before will already anticipate most of that trajectory.

I am peppering Showtime Corporate with e-mails, phone calls and written letters untill SHOWTIME gives my money back. I'm not holding Amazon responsible.

4677462,3,B005FISBV2,". . . if I am going to watch the next season. Get some adults to write the next shows. I was a Dexter fan from the beginning but had a problem when Rita came into the picture. Dexter as a family man? Anyway, I stuck it out and rate the other seasons 4.5 and 5 stars (glad to see her go). However, Season 6 is a contrived mess. When your whole show depends on the title character surviving by being picked up more than 5 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean by a random boat when he is going under and about to drown . . . Really?  Burning gasoline in a nice circle in the middle of the ocean . . . Really? This season is filled with this sort of fantasy writing to advance the plot. Showtime is lucky they haven't been sued by the producers of Fight Club and The Sopranos for stealing their story ideas. On the other hand, Brother Sam was one of the best characters ever to appear in this show. He would have been great to keep around for seasons to come. It was nice to see Dexter talk to a real person instead of the dead people in his mind. Sam would have given this show a much needed genuine character who demonstrated the possibility of redeeming oneself regardless of your past. No, kill him off. I was torn between 2 and 3 stars, about 2.5. Some reviewers gave this 1 star and complained about the beginning promo that spoiled the whole season. Maybe they bought bootlegs. I always skip the ads and did so with these discs by simply pushing the Skip button. I didn't know about the spoiler until I started to write this. One last thing. The carriers for the set I have will not hold the discs in place so they come loose even when you close the case.

Deb promoted to LT, maybe in small town usa but miami homicide, really  don't treat the viewer as a moron

dexter new libido for random sex, come on that just developed where
debs developing lust for dexter and her therapist saying its ok,  what is the therapist from the psycic hotline or jersey shore
letting dester go into crime scene first and no one hears him hammer the face off the wall,  again the viewer is not a moron
quinn becomes drunk shows up late, high and unshowered and keep his job,  really  in miami pd, really, no one notices it????
colin hanks acting is awful,  and unlike other killers here we just have a nut job no serial killer phscyo,  the series would have been better if tooth fairy was the killer for the series

The LONG Showtime promo at the beginning of each disc (the same one by the way, repeated) with an imposed inability to skip it is despicable.  That being said, Season 6 is not that bad but what limits the show from being great is the supporting cast.  Their characters are bland, predictable and developed and manipulated to fit a given storyline.  Further, (opinion only) they are just not good actors, or perhaps it's because Michael C. Hall is so good that he makes them look bad.  All of them, Jennifer Carpenter included, would be better at home on a daytime soap opera.

There are some real surprises this season, and the murders are extremely more disturbing(reminds me of the Ice Truck Killings). The guest cast fit right in with our Miami Metro Homicide Boys and Girls and thumbs up to casting Edward James Olmos and Collin Hanks-what a brilliant match up!

The scenes with Harry and Dexter  are especially good with some being quite humorous.  I could go on but I wouldn't want to spoil the excitement that awaits you. I've read the reviews about the DVD collection and how the previews spoil the ending.

If you don't have Showtime and haven't bought the DVD collection, or rented from Netflix yet but want to see Dexter S#6 without spoilers, do what I did.

Thank you for reaching out to us.

Paramount Home Entertainment is responsible for the manufacture and distribution of our Original Series DVDs. We are working together to remove that preview from future prints of the ""Dexter"" Season Six DVD.

We take your comments very seriously and have passed them on to the appropriate individuals within our organization.

Why in the world would you put the last 15 seconds of season 6 on the trailer of the season 6 blu-ray release? Not only that, but you can't even skip the trailer at all on every single disc? I get that you are trying to advertise, but why ruin the entire season for someone who has yet to watch that season? Please fix this for people who have not bought it yet. EPIC FAIL!",1346112000,4,1303,4.647826086956521
4677515,5,B005FISBV2,"This season of Dexter I thought was really good. Dexter is on top of his game as a forensic specialist and he cleans up multiple serial killer cases with his own hands, literally. I especially like the Doomsday Killer and the intense tableaus that were set up to depict the end of times at each step of the prophecy. Having a religious serial killer made Dexter question his beliefs and also his dark passenger that drives him. For me this is one of the best Dexter Seasons and the story lines and plots were well done.

The thing I didn't like was that every single disk had a two minute Showtime commercial that started the disk. You were locked from skipping it, fast forwarding it or going to the disk menu to start an episode. If that was not bad enough, it is on every disk and if you ejected a disk and later reinstalled it you had to watch it again. Now here is the really bad part! This ad included the ending of Dexter Season Six in the ad and it shows you the closing scene of the season. Brilliant, just brilliant! That was one of the most shocking scenes and now it is ruined.

I enjoyed the season and it is worth buying and watching. It is outstanding! It is a 5 star season.

The way the disks are made it is a 1 star set of disks.

I am tired of buying disks that start off with commercials for movies, ads, anti-cigarette smoking ads, and Blue-ray ads. Some disks that you buy also include a plea to donate money to save old films. Didn't you make enough money off them to restore them yourself? Lately some of the disks will not even let you skip, speed forward or go to the menu. I paid for the disk and I don't want to pay for ads! They are ruining the entertainment factor of something that I am buying. Get rid of them.

If you buy this DVD set, do not watch the 2 minute intro to avoid this massive spoiler!",1346112000,,1831,4.175637393767706

First and foremost, the killing duo of Edward James Olmos and Colin Hanks absolutely put me to sleep.  The dullest murderous duo ever.  For a show that has created some of the most fascinating psychopaths in the history of television/movies, this pairing, and the accompanying writing, were shockingly bad.  Neither of the actors scared me in the least.  Not for one moment did either of them seem believable as a killer.  Colin Hanks in particular.  It was embarrassing to watch him try so hard and so unsuccessfully to be a convincing bad guy.  He simply pouted a lot, like a petulant little boy.  Who on earth was responsible for that casting?  And there was no consistency to his character.  He was ridiculously wishy-washy.  And even after the ""twist"" was revealed, and the wishy-washiness made at least a small bit of sense, that didn't change the fact that all of the preceding episodes were deadly dull.

The whole over-arching religion theme of the season was incredibly heavy-handed, ridiculously smack-you-in-the-face.  A theme should play out naturally and subtlely in a story.  It shouldn't be clunkily imposed on every last facet.

I understand that a show must keep changing (and hopefully evolving), but the whole (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Debra in love with Dexter idea was ridiculous.  That is the sort of idea that a dying show uses (unsuccessfully) to create shock and drama.

I also agree with numerous other reviewers about the ads for other shows, as well as for the next season of Dexter, that you can't forward past.  And yes, especially the fact that the very last (shocking?) seconds of Season 6 are shown in a preview for Season 7.  Truly unbelievable.",1346112000,4,1880,4.851735015772871
4677527,5,B005FISBV2,"It seems strange to be fascinated with a show about a serial killer who kills serial killer but there is something addicting about DEXTER. The show keeps going on and on and the writers keep coming up with more serial killers and more scenarios for Dexter. Dexter is always one step of his pals at Miami Metro when he conducts his own investigation. Dexter could be the Sherlock Holmes of Miami if his obsession didn't have a macabre tone.

Rocky relationships are always at the heart of Dexter. LaGuerta and Batista, Debra and Quinn, and Dexter and everyone. The relationships are so intertwined and involved. It's hard to imagine how Miami Metro ever solves a crime. Season 6 seems creepier and more gruesome that any others. Dexter is evolving and beginning to be curious about religion and faith as he enrolls Harrison in a Catholic pre-school. It's perfect timing as Miami's newest serial killings appear to be religious in nature and based on the Book of Revelation and the Apocalypse.

Edward James Olmos as Professor James Gellar and his dedicated student Travis Marshall played by Colin Hanks are this seasons diabolical killers. They become known as the Doomsday Killers (aka DDK). Things are more serious as these killers think they are following the word of God. One of the creepiest murders is related to the Four Men of the Apocalyse. You have to see it to believe what the writers have come up with on this one.

Dexter's mptivations and religious ambiguity are tested when he meets Brother Sam played by Def Mos. Brother Sam is a reformed ex-convict and drug addict who has seemed to have found God. Could be be the Doomsday Killer or has he really repented and switched to a life of doing good?  A lot of questions are raised in this season's episodes.
Even Debra begins to question her exact feelings for her adopted brother Dexter.

In pure Dexter classic form, this season is full of surprising plot twists and our Dexter continues to survive near fatal escapades and still stay ahead of his Miami Metro coworkers. Miami must be one dangerous city with all the serial killers running around every year. There also must a lot of open cases in Miami as Dexter finds and disposes of the killers just as Miami Metro is steps away. The killers are never found so do the good people of Miami live in fear? Fortunately, DEXTER is a writer's fantasy and the show just keeps us addicted to the story.",1346025600,4,2411,4.690307328605201

The writers are phoning it in and don't give a damn about the finished product. Showtime doesn't seem to care either, long as people are tuning in. The voice-overs are ridiculous. Dexter is no more the witty killer, he is a lame one who only tells you what you are already seeing. And on top of that he's gone completely retarded.

And apparently Dexter is supposed to be the first one at a crime scene, before cops or anyone else: they actually WAIT for him to show up before entering a crime scene! When this NEVER happened before in the show--NEVER! And why do they do it this time? Because the writers need him to destroy evidence that could lead back to him.

On top of that, the writers pull an incest plot out of their ass based on one throwaway line from the pilot. SO they are going to ruin a main reveal by putting two characters in bed with each other. Terrific! We've waited 6 years for this character to find out about Dexter and it's going to be shadowed by her sexy feelings for him. Give me a break!

Pathetic writing. And people pay Showtime to watch this shit. Absurd. I swear, a group of random people on the internet could write a better season than these so-called professional writers behind this show.

I loved this show, the first two seasons are some of the best TV you'll ever see. The following seasons 3 and 4 are not great but still good, and season 5 is mediocre, but this season 6, it's terrible. Never was I bored with this show or shaking my head and scream at the TV the way I did with this season.

I have been a loyal purchaser of the Dexter discs since Season 1. We don't have cable TV, and so purchase the series we like. In 6 seasons this is the first time I haven't plowed through a season in a matter of days, simply because the whole ending was ruined. I didn't see the commercial until disc 2. Usually I don't watch them, but happened to this time and really wish I hadn't. To say it's a spoiler is a gross understatement.

As far as the season itself goes, it is a solid 5 stars. Right out of the gate it is more intense that all of Season 5. Don't get me wrong, I liked Season 5 a lot, but it was a lot slower than previous seasons. This season ramped it up several notches. I was engrossed from the first episode.

Wish I could give 5 stars, but sadly, the poor choices of the editing team at Showtime forces me to give a 1 star, in hopes that others will take my advise and either buy the blu-ray  (wish I'd have done that), or to keep the TV off until after the commercial.",1345766400,29,1239,4.107438016528926

4677582,4,B005FISBV2,"After a disappointing fifth season, ""Dexter"" rebounds here with a riveting series of episodes that will keep you wanting more. Season 5 of ""Dexter"" suffered from the mistake of not introducing the main plotline until nearly halfway in (and it really wasn't that compelling a story once it did kick in making for the weakest season yet). I was worried the show would continue on its downward spiral, but thankfully the writers redeem themselves this go-'round. While it doesn't pack the wallop of Seasons 4 or 1, this collection is far superior to Season 3 (with Jimmy Smits) or the lacklustre Season 5 (with Julia Stiles).

Dexter must embrace religion this season by helping track down the Doomsday Killers and befriending ex-convict-turned-preacher Brother Sam. The religious theme allows for some terrific gruesome set pieces as the Doomsday Kills are re-enactments of the Book of Revelations (a group of horses and a greenhouse scene are so particularly creepy they will stay with the viewer for days). The storyline also allows the writers to use one of the show's more familiar gimmicks against the audience, yet we never feel cheated.

The writers wisely shake things up at Miami Metro, where staleness was setting in. Laguerta and Deb are both promoted, and Quinn and Battista are now partners, which opens up a whole new bunch of plot possibilites. Work and personal pressures take their toll on Deb and she begins seeing a therapist. Quinn jeopardizes his career with a run of destructive behaviour after Deb rejects his marriage proposal. Masuka is still the pervy comic relief, but even he gets to tread new waters as the writers pair him up with a series of new interns. A new officer named Anderson transfers in from Chicago but the character doesn't make much of a splash. Despite these changes, Battista and Laguerta get less screen time this season, as the writers begin to explore the complex relationship between Dexter and Debra. By season's end, each of them make discoveries that will forever alter their respective futures.

Notable guest stars include Ronny Cox (""Deliverance""), Molly Parker (""Swingtown"") and even Rudy/Brian a.k.a The Ice Truck Killer makes a surprise return. If you were disappointed with Season 5 as I was, don't let that deter you from getting this--it's miles better.

4677583,3,B005FISBV2,"Some spoilers!

I really love Dexter and, like many other reviewers, have been a fan since the first season. I think that seasons 1-5 are all rated 5-stars and that the entire cast is great, especially MC Hall, who displays some of the most intense acting chops of any actor, ever. The writing of the previous 5 seasons has painted a vivid picture of Dexter and his fellow characters, and we know them well. The various antagonists have always been written brilliantly and the actors chosen have been outstanding in their roles (I'm talking to you, Trinity!).

I didn't feel quite as strongly in love with Season 6. While I agree that the show's regular cast members maintained their 10-star acting performances (J Carpenter!!), and I loved the Brother Sam storyline and Quinn's meltdown, I thought that there were two problems with this season:

1. Writing quality. What the HECK was this season about, really? Was it about Dexter and God? Dexter and the Doomsday Killer? Dexter trying to exorcise everyone of their Dark Passengers, like some quixotic archangel? Dexter going crazy (hello, Rudy, I missed you)? Dexter skipping work and being too busy to spend time with his son? Dexter the Amateur, making mistakes left and right (having poison gas reaction, still attempt to get bad guy -or- oops, someone took my son!)? Why was Dex sometimes written as a bit of an airhead, instead of being focused and precise? Was it an attempt to show his personal battle of Good v Evil? If so, I had too many ""wait, what?"" moments (random Midwest bathroom sex with a stranger) to fully appreciate that particular storyline.

And the most creepy and eyeroll-inducing aspect of the season... Deb tacitly being given permission to be in love with Dexter, regardless of their lifelong brother/sister relationship, by her one-note shrink. Ugh. I hope that was just a momentary lapse that will be ignored (like Rita's kids) in Season 7.

2. Colin Hanks was, to me, a confusing choice of an actor for such a major role on the show. I think I understand the premise behind the choice; namely, they wanted an actor who was able to look innocent and gullible so that he could ultimately have the audience bamboozled. Instead, this audience-member was bamboozled by the fact that they chose an actor who couldn't live up to the role and reputation of a Dexter foe. In other words, I thought young Hanks was a dud. Sorry, but I have to agree with other reviewers who've said the same thing. I also think that Edward James Olmos was under-used.

In all, I think that this season was ""okay"", but hope the writers stop trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to the characters - especially Dexter, who should be developed as a better, and more intense, main character instead of going backwards. However, as usual, I still can't wait for the next season to start!",1345507200,7,2841,4.752535496957404
4677584,3,B005FISBV2,"As a huge fan of Dexter (but someone who doesn't get Showtime) I purchase the seasons right when they come out and avoid reading anything about the new season to avoid spoilers. In my opinion this is a tough item to rate...Showtime deserves a 0 for forcing viewers to watch ads(without the ability to fast forward; although annoying I ""get"" this on a rental but find it despicable when I've paid for the season disc) on EACH disc AND for putting a major spoiler on said ads, although a previous reviewer noted this may have been resolved.

Relative to other seasons, I think Season 6 earns a 2.5 because of the major deviations from previous character development, an increased reliance on suspending reality (e.g., that a unit would wait for a blood splatter analyst before entering a crime scene and then have that analyst be the only one clearing the scene for an extended period of time) and a relative lack of suspense that served as an undertone for the other seasons and kept me up all night watching back-to-back episodes because I NEEDED to see what happened next. I found the new Deborah development ""icky"", without basis, and completely unnecessary.  (It also shatters the previously laid foundation that Dex and Deborah's relationship is not only healthy but perhaps the most healthy either of them have ever had.) Finally, I'm annoyed that they started so many potentially interesting subplots that were never developed (e.g., hand, issue with commissioner). It just seemed all over the place.

THAT SAID, it's Dexter! And without the comparison to the quality of other seasons the episodes themselves were highly entertaining and I'd give it a 5. I suppose when you've been as exceptional as Dexter has been for 5 seasons, the only place to go may be down.

Some of the old characters are shuffled around in different roles that to me make the show still interesting. My wife and I are real Dexter fans and we can hardly wait until the new season is released. It is one of our favorite shows and so far for us this season has not disappointed us.

Dexter returns to his High School for a reunion. He has some interesting experiences and he is also looking for a little payback to a guy that married Dexter's high school sweetheart that he was afraid to talk to. His secret first love that was unknown to everyone.

I enjoyed this first episode and to me they all got better from here on! I recommend it to you.

Please note that this show has graphic violence an adult themes.",1345420800,,1135,4.416267942583732
4677621,4,B005FISBV2,"By far, one of the best programs ever conceived. Many other series have waned in creativity after the first season but Dexter is still going strong in its sixth season. There are a lot of (unexplained) references though to previous seasons. If you've never seen Dexter before, I recommend starting with Season 1. It will be worth the effort. There is strong continuity between the seasons. It's like watching a very long story. The season ends with a surprise (of course!).

Cons:

The DVD has an obnoxious, loud and very long ad right after the FBI warning and you can't skip it. It's on every disc in the package. If you pause long enough for the screen saver to kick in or accidentally hit 'stop' then you must sit through another viewing of this ad. When I went to the Bio section of the last disc, I clicked menu to get back to the other bio's. It went back to the beginning again and Oh,boy! another viewing of the ad. I can understand having the ad but does it really have to be on ALL of the discs? Very annoying.

I would have given this 5 stars but for the ad.",1345420800,2,1070,4.313432835820896

The only problem is that showtime decided to spoil the ending to the season in the unskippable preview at the start of the DVD. How anyone with a brain decided this was a good plan is beyond me. The only logical conclusion is that no one at showtime possesses any brain whatsoever.

Here's a note about your fans, Showtime. Not all of them subscribe to your channel. So, putting the finale in the preview of the content I *just* bought along with other shows they may or may not care about and making it unskippable is beyond stupid.

I should've read the reviews, since many people seem to have noticed this as well. But, I didn't think I needed to since I was already convinced I was going to buy this product.

I won't be buying any more of these products. Six stars for the season, one star for this release of it.

4677623,4,B005FISBV2,"I do consider myself liberally religious, even so, this season was almost as good as the rest. Dexter learning about religion both the good and the bad sides of it I felt was a nice touch. The only time this season angered me was when the Doomsday killer acted holier-than thou, which admittedly was throughout the whole season. I for one enjoyed the other storylines as well, it gave me a break from the excessive darkness of the season's main storyline. Now I really want to read the book series to find out how the creators strayed from them, but I still like the show either way. Bottom line: if you're deeply religious, this season may offend you, but if you got through the first five seasons without a problem, you still may be in for some surprises, hope you have a strong stomache, enjoy!",1345334400,,797,4.503448275862069
4677624,2,B005FISBV2,"My husband and I are both huge fans of Dexter.  We pre-ordered the DVDs for this season as soon as we were able.

Unfortunately, we were not able to enjoy this season.  When you insert each of the 4 DVDs in this box set, you are forced to watch a 2 minute ad for Showtime.  You are not able to skip the ad on any of the DVDs, and are forced to sit through it as it displays a number of Showtime shows.  It even includes an ad for the sixth season of Dexter...

The ad for Dexter is only about 6 seconds long.  Interestingly, the marketing team at Showtime thought it would be nice to show THE LAST SIX SECONDS OF THE SEASON YOU'RE ABOUT TO WATCH!  It ruined the entire season before we even got a chance to watch it.  I have sent a letter to Showtime iterating this blatant oversight.  I will update this review if/when I receive a response from them.

Update 9/2:
I received a response from Showtime.  They thanked me for informing them of the error, but did not apologize.  They then said that Showtime is not responsible for DVDs, and that I should contact Paramount.  They did not provide contact information.

I found a contact for customer relations at Paramount, and sent an email to them.  I didn't hear anything for a few days, so I emailed them again.  At this point, they forwarded my email to the VP of legal and customer relations.

He responded immediately and asked for a good time to have a conversation over the phone.  He was very apologetic about the situation.  He informed me that Paramount is not in fact responsible for the content of the DVDs, and that they just manufacture them.  The actual content, including the promotions, are provided to them by Showtime.  So it was incorrect of Showtime to forward my comments to Paramount.  He said that he couldn't offer me a refund, but said if I wanted to pick another Showtime or Paramount TV show, he would be happy to send me a complementary season on DVD.  Within a few days, I received a copy of the latest season of CSI on DVD.

While speaking on the phone, he also mentioned that Showtime has been, and is still showing the offending promotion in other places beside the DVDs.  Apparently it's been showing for several months.  He mentioned that now that there have been so many complaints, they're trying to pull it from circulation.  He said that there has also been talk of a second run of the DVDs without the promotional material, but that they have not received the content from Showtime yet.

Overall, I'm extremely disappointed in Showtime's obvious attempt to pass the buck.  After ruining the show for countless fans, they not only refuse to apologize, but they refuse to even take responsibility for this whole fiasco.  On the other hand, I'm very impressed with Paramount's response to the situation.  Despite not being directly responsible for the content of the DVDs, I am happy that they apologized, and did what they could to make amends.  As a result, I'm adding one star to the review.",1345334400,595,2979,4.5187265917602994

4677676,5,B005FISBV2,"My wife and I began watching Dexter Season 6 as soon as it arrived a few days ago and finished watching it last night.

Unfortunately, Showtime/CBS Video includes a long advertisement for Showtime on each disc that includes various clips from shows that will be on during the upcoming Fall 2012 season.

You cannot fast forward through them, hit the menu option, or anything else. You are forced to watch the entire ad to get to the menu on each of the three discs. So, we watched the trailer waiting for the menu option on disc one.

With that said, the clip that Showtime/CBS chose to use for Dexter in this ad happens to be the final 15 seconds of Season 6.

That's correct, they show the closing scene of season 6 on the Dexter: Season 6 DVD. Amazing!

We won't ruin it for you here, but the clip that they use not only is the closing scene of Season 6, it sets up Season 7.

Shame on Showtime/CBS Video for ruining Season 6 for first time viewers. We waited an entire year for the release and learned exactly how the season would end thanks to a pre-menu ad before we even watched the first episode.

Not everyone buys various seasons to watch a second time. We do not have Showtime and rely on the DVD releases to watch Dexter each year.

We hope this helps other potential buyers. DO NOT WATCH THE PRE-AD IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SEASON 6. Mute the volume and walk out of the room for about four minutes and the menu will be on when you return.",1345334400,16,1447,4.274725274725275

This season is no different.  Is it my favorite season?  To hard to say after just watching it but I can say I can't understand any fans of Dexter, which you pretty much would be if your buying Season 6, not enjoying it.  This is a show that I love with actors that are great and writing that is always edge of your seat and smart.  I love each season and can't understand anyone giving this season lower than a 4 out of 5 ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of the show.  You pretty much know what you are in for.

Anyway, I highly recommend it and would say if your in no hurry to buy it, definitely wait until it goes down to $24.99 which is what I got it at the day before it came off pre-order.  I'm glad I bought it when I did as I see just a couple days later it's back up to $37!

Bottom line, if you like Dexter, you will like season 6!

It is very frustrating to be spoiled by the disc itself before I even get to watch the first episode. Considering that this is a commercial that offers incentives to subscribe to Showtime, they are acknowledging the fact that they know that some people will be watching this for the first time. There are so many other clips that they could have used instead. I find this to be pretty baffling.

The biggest issue I had with this release was the fact that at the beginning of every new disk you HAD to watch the Showtime advertisement.

4677680,5,B005FISBV2,"This sixth season counts twelve episodes, which is fitting since it is based on the Christian Apocalypse, in fact not the one in John's Book of Revelation, but another reconstructed version widely enriched with the numerous apocalypses that exist or existed in the Levant and even the Middle East traditions,  going back to the Zoroastrians and the Babylonians, hence to the old apocalyptic visions we can find in old Sumerian documents (clay tablets)  and Zoroastrian stories that are as old as the Sanskrit Vedas, if not even older. But altogether we remain within the vast tradition of the three originally-if-not-still-Semitic religions.

It is a fad today, and has been for quite a while, to integrate the Apocalypse in TV series. I can just quote the most famous ones like ""Supernatural"" in the USA (WB TV) and ""Being Human"" in Great Britain (BBC). And of course we have to think of the secular vision or rewriting of it in the long series of ""Terminator"" and the ""Sarah Connors chronicles."" But ""Supernatural"" is seen from the point of view of the monster hunters who try to prevent the coming of the apocalypse that is programmed in an inescapable way, and yet, there is always a way out when there is a way in. On the other hand ""Being Human"" is the apocalypse seen from the point of view of vampires and it is again the attempt to stop it by blocking the taking over of the earth by the Old Ones (the vampires from the original millennia of humanity). This sixth season of ""Dexter"" takes the apocalypse from the point of view of a deranged, fundamentalist Christian zealot who thinks that by enacting the prediction you could bring the end of the world. Dexter is thus the one who is trying to stop the criminal and that is not easy.

If you consider the apocalypse and all the religious bull that goes along with it in the minds of all latter night (not to speak of days) prophets, read my lips to see who I mean, is undrinkable, just avoid this season. If on the other side you are only interested in serial killers and catching them, what's more if you believe in one serial killer being able to catch all the serial killers and pass them to the other side of the transatlantic Gulf Stream back to Europe where they probably or obviously belong, then welcome to this season.

But there is a lot more than that.

The series this season definitely defends the idea that you have to believe in some kind of higher force behind the universe. It ridicules the fundamentalist zealots of the three originally-if-not-still-Semite religions for sure. But it states very clearly these people are dangerous.

In the same way it ridicules the fundamentalist zealots of the evolutionary theory that can only impose their stuff with harsh and purely rhetorical attacks on the creationist point of view, hence the zealot fundamentalist originally-if-not-still-Semite beliefs. Rhetoric is not an argument and certainly not evidence or proof of anything. It is nothing but play on words and superficial semantic jingling juggling. In fact there is no proof of any sort on either side.

On one hand the question ""Who created the universe?"" and the answer ""God."" will bring the next question: ""Who created God?"" And there is no end in that direction except the crazy science fiction of Ron L. Hubbard and Scientology that we are nothing but the rejects of an extra-terrestrial civilization that existed zillion, zillion, zillion, zillion, zillion years ago. And then ""Who created these extra-terrestrials?""

On the other hand if you are on the side of evolution and science, nothing comes from nothing. We can say the beginning of the universe we know is a famous ""big bang"" but then since nothing comes from nothing (Lavoisier among others in the 18th century) that ""big bang"" came from something, there was something before that ""big bang"". Then what was it and where did that come from? Evolution is a theory that perfectly explains life, in fact not only vegetal and animal life but also mineral and cosmic life, the way we know it and over a very long period of time, knowing that what we see at the outer limits of the visible universe (with modern technology) is what it was billions of years ago and we have no way to know what it is today, except through speculation and reconstruction.

In the same way this season uses a lot of symbols in the most irritating way, especially the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. It is written somewhere: ""I am the alpha and the omega"" but it is in fact slightly more than that: ""I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."" (Bible, Revelation 1:8, Standard American Version). The first part states that there was no time before the beginning, and states that there will be no time after the end. That led Saint Augustine to considering that eternity, before the creation and after the end of this world is timelessness. But then how can the past ""was"", the present ""is"" and the future ""is to come"" not be seen as contradictory, except if you play on words and consider that verbal tenses refer to time and hence there is no past and no future before and after the creation and the end of it. ""Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity."" (Bible, Ecclesiastes, 1:2, Standard American Version) Just as if the eclipse of the last episode was the end of the world. How nave!

As entertainment this season is great, even maybe greater than the previous ones because there is a fairly tighter unity of the twelve episodes and a fairly ugly fight for power at the head of the Miami Metro Police Department. But as for the ideology and the ideas it transports and even bombards onto you it is slightly nave and definitely over-powerful. We are not supposed to think about all those theories and political or ideological ideas, but at the very same time it is unfair to crush the audience with such heavy-weight hammers and expect the audience to say thank you and not be in anyway influenced by it. Luckily the classification of the season is -18, ""suitable only for persons of 18 years and over"" and ""not to be supplied to anyone under that age,"" but even so how can we assume that over 18 year olf people can be un-influenced by such heavy at least graphic arguments.

In fact it is not the apocalypse per se that is at stake here but the exclusive reference to the three originally-if-not-still-Semite religions. ""Supernatural"" is careful to refer to a lot of religions and other beliefs. ""Being Human"" is careful to refer to a lot of theories that have nothing to do with the three afore-mentioned religions. But this season of ""Dexter"" is extremely narrowly targeting that particular vision in the three afore-said religions. At least the Buddhist can have a great laugh at it. But is it so for everyone else?

Everything is off kilter in this season. The writing is stale and predictable. My best advice to anyone considering this purchase is: Don't do it.

If you feel you must watch it, find it at the library, or buy it by the episode. Had I bought it by the episode on streaming - I would have given up by episode four and not purchased anymore. On the strength of the last five seasons I purchased the entire season - BIG mistake.

This season of Dexter is from an alternative dimension of time and space where quality writing and original plots have gone extinct.

***SPOILER ALERT***

Characters are doing uncharacteristic things with little, no, or entirely inadequate motivation. Laguarta, was once a multidimensional character, who was smart, sexy, and ambitious - now she's morphed into a one-dimensional B*** who exists solely to give Deb a hard time.. Didn't we already see that in season one?

Deb does her best impression of Doogie Howser in the shows' most absurd move of making her the lieutenant. Her promotion to detective stretched the credibility of the show given her tender age, lieutenant is ridiculous

And speaking of age, Welcome to Miami Florida, where there are no women over 30... Well, at least not on Dexter. The post-pubescent women on the show have all been shipped off, no explanation for the Nannie, who has been replaced with Batista's 18 year old anorexic sister who appeared out of nowhere, contributes nothing to the show and takes up far too much screen time with her flying saucer eyes.

When Nick confesses on the beach to Brother Sam's murder, he laughs maniacally and taunts Dexter - The entire scene as with each episode is steeped in melodrama and felt more like an episode of Law and Order SVU...

The show used to have a tongue in cheek humor in regards to sex. What was once humorous has degraded into old fashioned sexism and over-used clichs. Seriously, since when did anyone laugh at Masuka's jokes? He was a creep and his creepy humor was used to show how others perceived him and differentiated their integrity from his vulgar wit - a subtlety that flew over the heads of the new writers.

The actors all seem to be on autopilot as if they are sleep walking through their lines - They can't even act excited to be stuck with all these bad lines.

The show got itself stuck in a desperate cycle of having a guest start serial killer, unable to break free and try something new, the show circles through this now all too familiar ground. So the show goes for some shock value and guts all of its integrity by bringing back Brian.

Not content to try and quicken this dying show with its former glory of the ice-truck killer coming back as Dexter's imaginary friend, they must instantly double dip this quickening with the left overs from the Trinity story line.

So... on a road trip, Dexter grabs a quicky with a 7-11 cashier (what?! Dexter, whose been with two women in his whole life?!) Debra goes all emo and falls in love with Dexter?! Did this season's writers even watch the previous five seasons? None of the characters would act this strange if they all dropped acid and went to a rave.

4677684,4,B005FISBV2,"Dexter is one of the few shows I actually buy on DVD (or Blu-Ray this year).  The idea of the character is unique among the genre, and the first seasons carried it off so well, better in many ways than the books, which is also a unique quality.  There is always some significant suspension of disbelief (how many times do people get to sneak into Dexter's house before he gets an alarm?  Even the cliff hanger:  Dexter would never have been so careless to allow it to happen, except when it's convenient to the story.  Dexter only works two hours a day, stays up all night, and is fine.)

Season six is different.  There is a continual darkness to it that wasn't there before, which I think happens because we don't have the lighter side:  no Rita, no Cody, no Astor.  Only we have a weaker villain, so the general darkness is mismatched to the weak bad guy, and some too easy resolutions to conflict.  Edward James Olmos could have been put to better use, and there are many opportunities to make the storyline tense that just zipped by.  We also had the focus on Debra's problems, and less on the other characters than we have seen in the past, including adding a new detective with very little character development.  In fact, we find the characters uniformly not liking the new guy in one episode, and then the theme disappears.

On the other hand, the cliff hanger means that next season has to be really different.  Unless it was a dream.  Deb as LT with LaGuerta as the boss with no one to intervene.

The biggest problem with the sixth season is that the new showrunners have absolutely no idea how to write their characters, so these characters end of acting completely OUT of character.  The worst of this is in the characterization of Dexter himself.  This builds up more and more as the season plods through one ridicuolous storyline after another, finally culminating in probably the dumbest ""cliffhanger"" ending EVER filmed.  I will not give away the ending in case anyone else wants to watch this wretched season for themselves, but suffice to say that the writers obviously had an intended final scene and were determined to have that scene, even if it meant throwing out every shred of common sense and believablity, as well as all characterization that had been built up in prior seasons.

The acting performances are good, considering that the cast had so much nonsense to work with.  Jennifer Carpenter deserves special kudos for enduring her contrived storyline with her ex-husband, which can only be the result of someone in the writer's room REALLY hating her guts!

I really love Dexter and, like many other reviewers, have been a fan since the first season.  I think that seasons 1-5 are all rated 5-stars and that the entire cast is great, especially MC Hall, who displays some of the most intense acting chops of any actor, ever.  The writing of the previous 5 seasons has painted a vivid picture of Dexter and his fellow characters, and we know them well.  The various antagonists have always been written brilliantly and the actors chosen have been outstanding in their roles (I'm talking to you, Trinity!).

I didn't feel quite as strongly in love with Season 6.  While I agree that the show's regular cast members maintained their 10-star acting performances (J Carpenter!!), and I loved the Brother Sam storyline and Quinn's meltdown, I thought that there were two problems with this season:

1. Writing quality.  What the HECK was this season about, really?  Was it about Dexter and God?  Dexter and the Doomsday Killer?  Dexter trying to exorcise everyone of their Dark Passengers, like some quixotic archangel?  Dexter going crazy (hello, Rudy, I missed you)?  Dexter skipping work and being too busy to spend time with his son?  Dexter the Amateur, making mistakes left and right (having poison gas reaction, still attempt to get bad guy -or- oops, someone took my son!)?  Why was Dex sometimes written as a bit of an airhead, instead of being focused and precise?  Was it an attempt to show his personal battle of Good v Evil?  If so, I had too many ""wait, what?"" moments (random Midwest bathroom sex with a stranger) to fully appreciate that particular storyline.

And the most creepy and eyeroll-inducing aspect of the season... Deb tacitly being given permission to be in love with Dexter, regardless of their lifelong brother/sister relationship, by her one-note shrink.  Ugh.  I hope that was just a momentary lapse that will be ignored (like Rita's kids) in Season 7.

2. Colin Hanks was, to me, a confusing choice of an actor for such a major role on the show.  I think I understand the premise behind the choice; namely, they wanted an actor who was able to look innocent and gullible so that he could ultimately have the audience bamboozled.  Instead, this audience-member was bamboozled by the fact that they chose an actor who couldn't live up to the role and reputation of a Dexter foe.  In other words, I thought young Hanks was a dud.  Sorry, but I have to agree with other reviewers who've said the same thing.  I also think that Edward James Olmos was under-used.

In all, I think that this season was ""okay"", but hope the writers stop trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to the characters - especially Dexter, who should be developed as a better, and more intense, main character instead of going backwards.  However, as usual, I still can't wait for the next season to start!",1343952000,30,2863,4.752535496957404

This is one of my favorite villians, such a sick and twisted character. I know he seems weak compared to the ones in the past, but he takes the crime scenes to another level of spectator fascination. Having a serial killer who believes he is working on God's behalf was an inevitable plot; I know some fans were disappointed, but I think the whole series has religious undertones waiting to explode into more discussion. Spoiler alert, Deb thinks she's in love with Dexter. Hopefully, her walking in on him killing someone kills this crush. I don't want her to hook up with her stepbrother (although off screen they did hook up). Such a wild show! I love Dexter. He's such a lovable character despite his fatal flaw.

This makes the episodes more suspensful.  I don't think the ""Dexter as a father"" storyline is working.  Dexter is never around for Harrison, even when he has time off. Always gone without any real explanation to anyone is too suspicious.  Frankly, Harrison should be completely attached to the babysister and calling her mommy by now. She has no time for anything else in her life, when does she go to class for whatever she's studing. Dexter is usually better about covering his tracks as well.  Miami homicide can catch everyone else's slip ups but not Dexter's?  He seemed to be running around like a loose cannon, never getting caught by a video camera, hanging out with DDK, checking into hotels, renting cars, using his own cell phone even to call police to his own crime scene, looking up stuff about suspects and victums on his computer AT WORK! These are all things that get the smartest crimminals caught.  I was really sick when they started with the storyline about Deb having suppressed feelings for her brother.  Please!

Nevertheless, we have to sit thru countless episodes of countless characters who NEVER let up preaching God's word to Dexter! The plot meanders all the way to ""Nebraska."" A completely USELESS episode that made me think the writers came up with it LONG after they'd finished writing the others & possibly just needed an EXTRA episode (a #12 perhaps?)

i was going to write in this review that i was starting to lose interest in this series and this was probably the last season i would be tuning in for.  however, i just finished the last episode and the final cliffhanger was exactly what i had been waiting to happen since season 4 or so!  finally, they get to it.  i consider this a good thing though it also points to the flaw i found in this series which is the pacing of dexter's evolution overall.  on the one had people are going places in dexters world (ie debra being promoted) and as another reviewer mentions dexter is forced to confront faith, etc.  however, one thing really wears on me.  the random new serial killer that miami metro has to deal with and is killed after exactly and not before 12 episodes theme is starting to become its own cliche.  instead of a natural progression of events its starting to feel like some of the episodes and events are thrown in to help pace for the final plot twists.  its as if the shows writers have dexter's calculated methodology for how he kills as their guide for how they write seasons.  i understand it logically but emotionally after seeing the same formula several times now it kinda grates on me here.  i can't say any of the episodes in this season are flat out bad per se but just not that memorable.  as others have mentioned the first two seasons i thought were really strong (and are my favorite), the next few i enjoyed cause i was hooked, here i just wished they would have sped things along a bit.  while i would go back and watch seasons 1 and 2 again (and have already re-watched 1) i don't plan on re-watching this one.  still, more enjoyable then most of television.  i hold dexter to a high standard ;)",1341792000,,1745,4.375776397515528

The new bad guys mix it up. Dexter is evolving and learning more about himself and how Harry's code serves him and his Dark Passenger.  The other characters are also evolving and we have a real interest in them because the writers are careful to keep them true. This season challenges Dexter as a father and human.  It's natural that he questions a higher power at work. He IS human after all and seeks answers as his life has moves forward.  I was feeling that Rita was a manipulator and not a soul mate.  Poor Dexter thought the Jimmy Smitts' character was a soul mate in friend form, but he was betrayed. Lumen was a soul mate of sorts but got past her ""need"" and needed the light of hope again. We watch to see how Dexter moves forward to get a real life and make a life for his son.

Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos do a great job of acting, the story arcs and plot lines are smooth and consistent throughout the show, subplots are well developed with other characters keeping much more relevant and interesting stories than in some of the other seasons, and the themes and motifs of religion are a refreshing change and transition from the fatherhood/family ones that were beginning to grow rather stale. Additionally, there are lots of interesting character developments that occur, as well as underlying plots that should transition into later seasons well (should all of the stories continued to be developed in later seasons-- I hope they will, as this is something that producers hinted at during the commentary/special features on this season).

A. Tie between Seasons 4 & 6 (Trinity Killer & Doomsday Killer),

B. Season 2 (Bay Harbor Butcher) ***Most narrow gap between the remaining seasons in terms of favoritism is between Seasons 2&5

4677744,5,B005FISBV2,"We got the premiere movie package for True Blood, but I was hunting through Showtime on Monday and found all of Season 6's episodes of Dexter. I normally have to wait until the DVD comes out. After reading some of the negativity here, I was prepared to not like this season as much. Not the case, it was gripping and I finished all of the episodes in three nights, and now I'm ready for Season 7. Now to convince my husband to keep the premium channels for fall.

While Travis Marshall wasn't nearly as compelling as Trinity, the show has done well at creating the super-villain. The only one I was never really happy with was Miguel Prada (Jimmy Smits) in Season 3, and I feel that they drastically underused Jonny Lee Miller as Jordan Chase. I wish he had been a bigger part of Season 5. We got to see Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos from the start and Colin throughout the entire series.

Religion is a HUGE part of the season and runs straight through. And it actually makes sense for Dexter to be struggling with religion and redemption at this point in his life as he tries to be a better person for his son. For those squeamish about religion being tied in, they're going to be offended right off the bat because there are some disturbing scenes. Also, this season definitely had more gore than I've remembered from before .

***Spoiler***
As far as Debra's development, I think Jennifer Carpenter did amazing work this season, but then I've always liked her take on Deb. Yes, her revelation about Dexter created some squeamish moments simply because he is absolutely clueless to what is going on in her head, but moments between these two have always been my favorite part of the show. They've never been the best at communication, something that is discussed this season. But, they have gone through a lot together and have always been there for each other. And no, there is no biological tie, so if that's where the show is headed, well, I go down that road because I want to see what happens with these characters. I think the last moments of the finale may diminish some of those feelings ha! It has to be difficult for the actors considering their own history together, and to the reviewer that brought up their marriage and divorce, well that's just tacky.

*Highlights: Dexter's joy ride to Nebraska and seeing an old, familiar face alongside him, and Mos Def as Brother Sam.",1339545600,7,2393,4.571095571095571
4677745,2,B005FISBV2,"I'll start off by saying that I was at least entertained by a good portion of the season.  It's not that this is boring or doesn't hold your interest; what the problem is that the characters are changing into people that are just not likeable like they were.

Some of the mistakes Dexter makes this season are ridiculous.  I know he gets into jams and that is what keeps the show interesting, but I am just not caring about his character as he time after time goes into situations completely wrecklessly.  ""I am a very neat monster.""  What happened to that?  Dexter stopped being a ""neat monster"" in season 4 when he hung out with Arthur Mitchell in broad daylight and called his cell phone and whatnot, but this season it becomes noticably absurd how much Dexter wants to get caught.

And he's not the only character that is being ruined.  Deb hits one out of left field toward the end - I mean seriously, it is completely absurd.  Plot twists that have no business ruining a good show just spring up out of nowhere.  The cliffhanger at the end of the season was completely wasted.  It should have happened last season or at least under different circumstances.  This is a mild spoiler, but Dexter uses AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE as a kill room.  WHAT!?  Send that man to jail, he deserves it for being a horse's arse!

The writing took a nose dive.  It really disappoints me, too, because I have every season of Dexter on blu ray, but I can't get this one because it will just make me angry.  Or sad.  Or horny, for some odd reason.  No, not horny.  Just the first two.  I would say go ahead and watch it, but don't buy it.",1339200000,13,1620,4.351170568561873
4677786,2,B005FISBV2,"I just finished watching Season 6 and at the end of the day, I got to say I was pretty disappointed.  To give a little context, I can't say I'm a die hard Dexter fan, but I do very much like this series, mostly because I like the character Dexter with all his complexities and demons, Michael C Hall puts a very good spin on his Antihero.  But this season, the whole Doomsday murders were a bit of a turnoff, possibly cause the crazy religious convictions of a delusional mind are bit tired, possibly because it was portrayed in such a way that just didn't make them or its main antagonist played by Colin Hanks interesting.  I'm not sure what the writers were thinking, but if the idea was to turn everything left off from season 5 on its head, the execution was poorly implemented...now on to the specifics (if you haven't seen this Season specifically, detailed spoilers follow, however, you can skip over the spoilers to the conclusion section that is spoiler free)

**SPOILER ALERT**

First off, I maybe amongst the few that really liked Dexter and Lumen together.  That dynamic struck me in a way few series have been able to pull off, I felt he met his soul mate, more so than Rita since as close as they were, there was still a side to him she would NEVER understand, so it was obvious in season 5 just how strongly he felt about Lumen because she saw him for what he was - a serial killer - and she was cool with it.  But in season 6, I might have caught 1 single passing reference to her, that was it and maybe 1 regarding Rita, I cant remember for sure, but it almost seems like that slate has been permanently wiped from existence.  Also, aside from Harrison (his biological son), wheres the ongoing dynamic with Astor and Cody?  They were also no where to be found in this season with little to no context as to how or what they are presently doing.  Dexter reconciling his personal/ family life with his life as a serial killer is the cornerstone of the entire show, but this season, aside from Deb, they were MIA.  For example, imagine an entire season of sopranos, where its just Tony Soprano doing his gangster thing after Carmilla dies, Anthony and Meadow are gone to live at their grandparents and he doesn't make one passing reference to them the entire season...kind of boring since the entire show was predicated on the contrasting aspects of the two different lives he lives - family man, gangster family man...the same can be said of Dexter.

...and Deb, WTF?  Did anybody else find it just a little bit weird shes all of a sudden figured out she's in love with him?  Even if they aren't biological brother and sister, it still struck me as completely weird because theres no redeeming qualities between them, they have ZERO screen chemistry, which probably makes sense why their real life marriage didn't work out.  IDK, but if the show continues in that direction, cause the cat is out of the bag at the end of the season, I'm not sure if I want to continue watching and just chalk it up to 5 great seasons, however I'm not as black and white as I sound, I'll at least give it my best shot...point being though, I just don't like the possibility of that pairing at all.

Moving on, I have my complaints, but I don't want to make it sound like the season was a complete failure.  I personally thought a high note was Mos Def as Brother Sam.  Now there's a relationship that could have and should have been cultivated deeper, it would have added an interesting dynamic and possible conclusion since the longer Brother Sam was around, you could sense his influence - toward the light - growing, even though Dexter openly rejected it, it did give him pause in his internal dialog.  For once, Dexter had a real life person - rather than his dead dad - try to instill a different ideology where the Dad ultimately failed, to which the dad admits eventually.

As for the main antagonists, the doomsday killers - Travis Marshall (Colin Hanks) and Professor Gellar (Edward James Olmos) - there really isn't much to say other than I particularly didn't like Hanks squirrely type of acting, I actually found him to be annoying.  But aside from that, any interesting or redeeming significance this duo was trying to accomplish or the lore to which inspired their actions were lost in a contrived ""this dudes a nutjob"" story line that you end up questioning your boredom tolerance after the second or third episode of the season.  The religious spin has been done before, it certainly has been done better, but unfortunately this aspect along with the flat, uninspired writing were the seasons biggest failures IMO.

The final thing I want to touch on is when is it going to be a successful day for Miami Metro Homicide?  There has been 6 seasons now where the Department has been nothing more than a complete dog and pony show since Dexter is the one who always gets to the bad guy first while the rest of the department gets to piss in the wind at the end of the day.  There have been tons of close calls over the years and different characters have had their suspicions about Dexter, but that seems to be about as far the show is willing to go.  Time to change that.  Hopefully the big reveal at the end really is as big as it should be...

**CONCLUSION (no spoilers)**

Dexter is a fun show to watch, with its interesting characters and tight writing with its twists and turns, but certainly isn't the last bastion of good television.  I hope for the sake of a show I've really come to enjoy over the last few years that it can be saved and theres still tons of room to make changes.  I certainly understand not every season can be its best, there are bumps in every road, however there always comes a time when you're fresh out of ideas and its time to hang up your hat and end it while you're still on top of your game (looking at you simpsons).  Unfortunately, season 6 would not be my best choice to go out on and it would have probably been the better decision to skip over the filler and jump right into what would be a conclusion arch.

Honestly, I would recommend you skip watching the season and catch the important stuff in the recap, since 90% of season 6 is utterly devoid of anything you probably like about ""Dexter"".  Also pretty sure the recap will probably harp on the big reveal, which was the very last 5 seconds of episode 12.",1338854400,17,6362,4.460742018981881
4677787,5,B005FISBV2,"Okay, apparently I'm not your typical Dexter fan. It seems the more a lot of viewers were loving Dexter the more I was losing interest, I fell in love with season one Dexter Morgan. You remember him right, the cold, calculating mystery man who could appreciate the ""artisty"" of another killers works? This is a return to that while still that the character has evolved emotionally. Okay to explain my love of season six I have to explain what I feel were the failures of seasons 3,4 and somewhat 5. I liked season 2 a lot.  It was a bit taudry, soap opera like but the stuff with Doakes was priceless and kept my attention all the way through and Lila did make a pretty good foil, and it was fun to have Dexter leaning the pleasures of sex. By season three everyone seems to agree was the weakest, a fairly weak villain in Jimmy Schmidt and that skinner killer that was just boring as all get out with what had to be the worst final episode execution by Dexter, it's like the writers over did it with filler and forgot they had a season to wrap up. Then season four which I must admit left me cold, I never gave a crap about Dexter as a family man so the Lithgow plot didn't do it for me and Rita just seemed to prove to be more of an obstical for the Dexter I fell for in season one rather than his guiding light. Then you have season five which had its high points but was dragged down by the Dexter step daughter plotline, the LaGuerta/Batista plotline that went nowhere and served only to pad the story out to 13 episodes.

  Now you have season six, Dexter's a free man, no one to get in his way, no one (Rita) to explain himself to. We see he's an emotinal indivisual without the scenes being over the top, he loves his son, it's more than obvious and it's the most rewarding (for me) relationship Dexter's had. The religious overtones work perfectly for me, althoug I'm not religious I find faith an interesting subject, I found Brother Sam one of the best characters to be introduced in the Dexter series. This is the first time since the Ice Truck killer that I actually found the big baddie of any interest. Finally, the cops aren't continously on Dexter's arse, that got old around season three. Plus the inner monologue's as sharp as it's been since season one, whereas for atleast the last three seasons Dex's inner thoughts were a bland as a boiled potato. Everything's been sharpened up, the characters (old and new), the cases, the subplots and overall moodiness of the series. Oh my god even Deb's plot is good, she's not the annoying little sister that needs her boyfriends approval in this season, she has her insecurities but they're understandable. This season's got 5 stars from me.",1338508800,31,2704,4.445564516129032

4677789,1,B005FISBV2,"If Michael C. Hall and the rest of the cast and production team have any conscience, then Season 7 of Dexter will be one episode that is two minutes long.  That episode will begin with all living characters sitting in a room, looking apologetically at the camera.

Dexter will be standing with the characters.  Dexter will walk around the room, shooting each of the characters in the head.  Dexter will then turn to the camera, say ""I am sorry for Season 6"" and then shoot himself.

The credits will then begin to roll, but the credits will only say ""We Are Sorry.""

This is the worst season of anything, ever.  No show has ever dropped off the deep end so precipitously.  This makes season 6 of 24 look like The Godfather.

This is worse than Highlander 2, worse than Police Academy 7, worse than Friday the 13th: Jason in Space.

When you are watching the show and actually feeling ashamed for the writers, you know they have lost the plot.  They had literally no respect for the character traits that had been carefully crafted in the previous seasons.  Dexter just does what he feels like at the moment and gets away with it because he is now both really stupid and really lucky.

Laguerta is detestable.  Deb is mega-detestable.  Quinn is unwatchable.  I seriously wanted every character to die by the end of the season.

The only decent thing in the entire rotten exercise was Edward James Olmos, who stepped aboard this sinking ship way too late.  And he is the element most people were complaining about.  His calm delivery is the only thing that kept any of this cesspool even temporarily watchable.

On the other hand, Tom Hanks' kid was brutal, and he is the one garnering praise from what I can tell.  Are you kidding me?  Watch for his stellar ""Sybil-inspired"" performance after the ""big reveal.""

I will watch the first two minutes of Season 7 and if it is anything other than my recommended plotline, I am turning the TV off immediately.  I don't see how the people involved can live with themselves if they film anything other than my suggestion.",1337644800,25,2062,4.601648351648351

 But the issue with this series & the 5th is their are too many holes in the plot. I'm still wondering why Quinn has not pursued Dexter with his suspicions, especially after the detective been found murdered after investigating Dexter & its never even brought up in this season, like nothing happened, shows laziness on the writer behalf. The increased risk taking by Dexter seems to ruin the plot, seems the writers are just lazy, can't be bothered finding an original twist.

 But part from it being the worst season so far (1st & 4th being the stand outs), it is still Dexter & one of the top ten series of the 21st century, its still fantastic viewing television, just sack a couple of writers please & don't ruin Dexter & its place in history as one of the best.

There are just far too many plot holes, inconsistencies, and non-sensical acts here to even consider watching it (really, Miami metro was waiting for a blood spatter analyst before entering a crime scene...not only that, they let him investigate the scene before they entered.  While alone in that crime scene, no one from Miami Metro heard him pounding away at the wall with a hammer?).  My suspension of disbelief can only take so much.

If you have never seen Dexter, I recommend that you watch the first episode of season one. When you do, you will be addicted to a serial killer with morals. My husband was not initially ""interested"" in such a thing. However he now, wants to see what the writers can come up with next...they continue to wow us.
Poor Dexter, its getting harder and harder for him to play his part, the rules keep changing...",1335398400,,530,4.363636363636363
4677794,3,B005FISBV2,"The killer was definitely interesting to me.  In a way, his own inner good vs. evil was almost more interesting then Dexter's.  This might almost be my favorite season so far, except for one thing.

The writers seem to have forgotten what Dexter said at the very beginning of the show.  HE HAS NO REAL INTEREST IN SEX!  It started last season with that whole thing last season with Lumen, which made no sense at all.  (He says he has no interest in sex, She is so traumatized by what happened to her that she sleeps in a closet and cowers in a corner with her hands over her ears when she hears people having sex.  Then we are supposed to believe that killing someone together is enough to overcome all that and get them to fall into bed together? Really?) Now, this season, we see him getting BJ's at a high school reunion and a random quickie while on a road trip.  I get that Showtime has to have its gratuitous sex scenes for its audiences, but they could have done it with the other characters (remember all they did with Quinn and his gf in season 4?) without changing something that always made Dexter Dexter.  Yes, I know he and Rita obviously had sex.  After all, We have Harrison, but that was part of his cover as a husband.  Now Rita is gone, so why force something on him that he already feels no need for?  I'm sure I'll buy this season, but this time, mostly because of the deeper exploration of Light vs Dark in religion.  Much more of that pointless character change in Dexter next season, and I'm through with the show.",1333756800,5,1537,4.3321678321678325

4677836,5,B005FISBV2,"Its around mostly the 5th season that most really successful cable series kinda dip and fall. As for Dexter season 6 which I just finished; I say its really only just began. Not only does this season continue to have excellent performances(Mos Def, Colin Hanks), but continues to blow your mind and having yourself wonder; Who? What? Where?

I really enjoyed the 'Fight Club'esque episode where Dex hangs out with his brother Brian in a trip of crazy antics.
Best Quote Ever, from Brian - ""Ahhh, Deb, the one that got away"".

I'm not going to give anything away of course, but just so you know; this season is very Religious in a lot of aspects, and it makes Dexter think about his own faith and beliefs. This time around its the Dooms Day Killers and of course its up to Dex and the cast of Miami Metro to solve it. Big changes for a lot of characters are happening, Batista, Quinn and especially Deb are going through hard times as well in their personal lives.

Always a show that makes you want the next episode right away, and the ending? Oh my God! Dexter as a series continues to keep you coming back for more.",1332028800,16,1117,4.412621359223301

4677838,2,B005FISBV2,"Every one and every thing will eventually let you down, and for me, Dexter did that in spades with Season 6.  Dexter is one of the few shows I eagerly look forward to, but that is tempered now.  Its strengths are its ability to imbue empathy for a serial killer and challenge your assumptions but season 6 challenges nothing.  It evokes little but boredom.  It is predictable and heavy handed.  I have no need or want to own this season, despite having all the previous years.  I KNOW if you haven't seen this yet, you will side-step this review.  I can only suggest you be patient and rent it from the library or borrow it from a friend.  Season Six of Dexter is regrettable.  As frustratingly bad as the sixth season of LOST.  Perhaps HBO has it right in ending a lot of their shows in 5 years.

Let's hope for the best for season 7 and 8 (confirmed).",1329868800,29,853,4.30188679245283
4677839,3,B005FISBV2,"Dexter hasn't reached the Weeds of really great series' gone down hill, but this is the worst season so far.  I liked the light/dark religious thing and the idea of him having some humanity.

The writing is the main thing that bothered me:
  -The main thing that bothered me was that I feel like the writers forgot that the detectives didn't know Gellar was dead and they kept focusing there search on Travis instead of Gellar.
- There usually isn't a bunch of holes in regarding 'why hasn't dexter been caught,' but there were a ton in this season and he took much bigger risks then he should have(there had to be cameras, which he was never worried about)
- They had a bunch of side plots that never panned out to be anything:  The hand, Deb's crush, Matthews getting fired,etc.  Its cool to have some cliff hanger, but they didn't even try to wrap these up. They shouldn't have introduced the side plots if they weren't going to have the time to wrap them up.",1328140800,25,962,4.4375
4677840,3,B005FISBV2,"The sixth season of dexter is probably my least favorite season so far.

The sixth season focuses on religion. We see Dexter facing religion for the first time. I found this interaction to be boring and uneventful. Dexter's religion is the code and his interaction with new character Brother Sam seems to fake and unrealistic. Dexter just doesn't get religion and he has no reason too. The fact the season subtly displays a change in Dexter and how he interacts with religion and the code seems out of character.

The main villains in this season are the doomsday killers, religious zealots who believe that the world is coming to an end. Edward Olmos is pretty convicing and acts decently (but all I could think of is Jaime Escalante). Colin Hanks delivers a pretty boring performance as Professor Geller's (Olmos) assistant.

There were a few episodes in the season that I just didn't like and were probably unnecessary (""Nebraska"").

(possible spoiler ahead but doing my best not to reveal anything)
In the end the big surprise of the season isn't that much of a surprise at all. It wasn't a big wow moment as in previous seasons. It has been done before. Although one could go back in the season and see all the interesting things the director did to make the surprise work, it doesn't change the fact that I just didn't care about the surprise in the first place.

The ending though will change everything for Dexter and whats to come. The last 30 seconds of the season really makes me wonder whats to come. I will definitely continue to watch, but this season just didn't do it for me.",1326672000,22,1591,4.647686832740214
4677841,3,B005FISBV2,"I've given you a full couple weeks to be ready for this. I'm going to talk about the recently ended season of Dexter. There will be spoilers. Oh yes, there will be spoilers. As a primer, you may want to look at what I've already said of this season, here.

As far as seasons of Dexter go, this the sixth season I feel was middling. But I think even a middling season of Dexter is still a strong contender for your TV viewing time. Thinking back on this season it feels a lot happened, but not a whole lot of much importance. The big bad was interesting, and there was some intriguing development going on outside of the main arc, but a lot of the rest of what happened either hasn't come to fruition yet or is all sound and fury.

So lets start by looking over some of the key B plots, then we can end big by looking at the big bad and the finale.

LaGuerta, as always, is looking out for LaGuerta. She and Angel have divorced in between seasons, their marriage may have been as legitimate as a Kardashian's, once it stopped paying off for her it was time to call it quits. In typical fashion, she was able to blackmail her way into a promotion to captain. Just as things seemed to be coming up all LaGuerta her maneuverings were stymied a touch as Deborah was promoted into her vacated position rather than Angel as she had planned. The only really important things to take away from this is Deb is now LT and LaGuerta is a hardcore manipulative bitch. Both of things will continue to effect the season and onward.

Quinn and Deb are still a thing. For about an episode anyway. Then he has to ruin it all by doing something as silly as propose. They break up and she becomes his boss. Quinn being the rational adult he is handles it quite well as step by self destructive step he fills his life with booze and whores. Being the consummate professional these habits never effect his work life, except for every time we see him, all culminating to Angel nearly getting killed.

Masuka continues to be your comic relief. And now he's got college students. It's a surprise to no one that he offers his intern position to the class sexpot. Neither should his advances on her be much of a surprise. What may have been surprising is her reciprocation. Also that she stole a key piece of old evidence, namely the mannequin hand from the Ice Truck Killer case. Sexpot is let go, and Masuka drafts Louis to fill her shoes, and cover up her theft, a task which he conveniently proves to be very adept at.

That's when the Louis thread slowly starts to get a little weird. He starts to date Angel's sister Jamie the uber-sitter, good on `im, we learn he's developing a Serial Killer video game, oh and he has the mannequin hand. Dexter berates him for wasting his life creating such a sick piece of software. Dexter's words have something of an effect on Louis, but I'm not sure if I've decided what exactly he's playing at. He shelves the game, devotes himself to working for the department, and anonymously mails the hand to Dexter, but not before drawing deliberate palm lines on it. This is actually one of the items I'm curious to see handled next season, as Dexter never has a chance to see the hand before the events of the finale. I don't have much of a clue as to what it's supposed to mean, and I am left to wonder if Louis' change of heart stems from him being suspicious of Dexter.

Dexter finds religion. Well, not in the way you're thinking, but religion permeated this season in an odd way. Dexter decides he should enroll his son Harrison in a Catholic preschool. This plan hit a minor speed bump when the school finds Dexter is completely without faith, but our favorite vigilante is able to overcome such minor details. Dexter makes a new friend in reformed criminal turned man of god Brother Sam. Brother Sam was a brief source of light and hope to Dexter, who encouraged him to find the good in himself. What light he kindled was exterminated when Sam came to an untimely end. Things never end well for friends of Dexter. And of course there was the overtly old testament nature of the Doomsday Killer, our big bad, but we're not quite there yet.

Deborah, after involvement in a shootout, seeks some mandated counseling. She does her time, but discovers herself unraveling and issues pouring out of her into her therapist. May be that after all she's been through she needs some therapy. Her big breakthrough might not be what you'd expect. Turns out she's in love with her adoptive brother. Makes a sort of sense, really, everyone she's ever been with has either been very much like Dexter or very much not Dexter. Also keep in mind he is her adopted brother. So it's okay to think this is hot.

The Doomsday Killer. As far as big bad's go, this season's was one of the more interesting. And likely the most insane, though not at first glance, and Doomsday evolved in unexpected ways. In the beginning we had a duo of religious zealots working to bring the end of the world by reenacting biblical passages in gruesome tableaux. Honestly, the dynamic between master and pupil was different at first as we've never been shown a team of killers but seemed a little uninspired. They seemed a little wooden. I can't tell you if that was by design or not.

Then we had the student questioning his master, and the righteousness of their cause. Things started getting a little more interesting here as you could see that Travis was losing faith in Gellar and it was only a matter of time before he defied his dark master. Dexter was more than willing to help. In Travis, Dexter saw a chance he never had in himself. If Dexter could kill Gellar while Travis was still innocent, he could rid Travis of his Dark Passenger in a way Dexter could never be rid of his.

But, in one of this show's greatest twists, we see Travis is a one-winged angel, and is quite insane. Gellar has been dead for some time, by Travis' hand, and Travis has been single-handedly working to bring about the doomsday since day one.

In the final moments of the season Travis ends, of course, on Dexter's table as the show delivers on a promise made several times over several seasons. Deborah walks in on him in the midst of a kill, and as they see each other the season ends with us having to wait nine months to see what unfolds.

As Dexter seasons go, I'd rate this the 3rd best, of 6.
3 out of 5 justifiable homicides",1326067200,24,6397,4.43404255319149
4677842,3,B005FISBV2,"Season 6 was off to a roaring start and a slithering delicious time.  Some very unique plot twists.  I particularly loved the duality of the DK and the eventual revelation of his true identity.  Still there were some plot turns left hanging (the delivery of Lewis' present to Dexter), which is not unusual for this show as it seems to make a habit of occasionally taking the viewer down a dead end story line (why was Quinn being investigated by IAD in Season 3?).  Loved seeing Rudy, aka Brian Moser, back in town!  The conclusion, however, was a huge disappointment.  I am sooooooo sick and tired of all the Harrison crap -- that stupid brat should have been crucified by DK, a la Russell Crowe's son in Gladiator.  One satisfying bonus -- Debra kept her pants on for most of the season -- no small feat -- she ""undressed"" her mind and emotions instead.  Hope I didn't give away any of the plot to those sensitive souls who read reviews first and watch the show second or never.",1324944000,7,980,4.466292134831461
4677843,1,B005FISBV2,"Dexter Season 6 was boring. This will be the first season that I will not purchase. The episodes were just all over the place- choppy and sloppy. In Season 6, Debra's personality is watered down, Dexter's character does not grow at all- he continues to interfere with investigations, which almost get him, and his family killed (same storyline as always). Maria is promoted, so she is rarely seen. Quinn has a melt down when Debra turns down his proposal. The doomsday killer- Colin Hanks, is a religious sociopath who is delusional.",1324166400,28,533,4.868131868131868
4677844,5,B005FISBV2,"UPDATE: This review is about the show itself, not the hackjob that Showtime did to the DVDs/Blu-rays, giving away the ending in the first two minutes.

Finally, Dexter has to to confront religion.  Remember season 1, episode 1, where Dexter was murdering his first victim (that we saw), who was praying for help, and Dexter said, ""That never helped anyone.""?  Well, that same Dexter, the same serial killer, now has a son about to go off to school, and he has to make some major decisions in his life.  Will he raise his son as a religious, Catholic boy?  Does Dexter himself need to further explore his own faith and beliefs?  Dexter truly becomes interested in religion in this season.  What does it mean?  Why do people worship a God?  And why should Dexter, a serial killer, have any kind of faith in a higher power?  These are all questions that Dexter explores this season with the aid of his growing son, his sister, Brother Sam, and the major storyline (Doomsday Killer).

I watch a lot of true crime television, and I know that there are and have been plenty of serial killers who led normal lives on the side and shocked people when they were eventually discovered.  I am always curious as to the emotions that go through their head and what drives them, and Dexter kind of gives us a glimpse into that.  While of course the show is highly overdramatized for the sake of entertainment, there are flashes of real raw emotion from Dexter that makes me shudder and think, ""there's a serial killer.""

Like I said, this season is obviously focused on religion.  Dexter develops an odd bond and curiosity/suspicion with Brother Sam, a murderer/drug addict turned priest.  Brother Sam claims that God helped him ""ease his dark passenger,"" I guess you'd say, and Dexter becomes extremely interested in whether or not this is possible for himself.  Also, Dexter's sister, Debra (played by Jennifer Carpenter), is AMAZING this season.  She finally decides to open up to people, and her emotions are so raw, intense, and real.  Debra seriously wants to learn more about Dexter and become closer to him, and that is a recurring theme throughout the season.

The main killer in this season is the Doomsday Killer, who especially targets women based on biblical text.  This is another method that forces Dexter to confront his feelings on faith and religion.  He even bluntly asks Batista, completely serious, why he believes in religion.  Dexter never really thought of these things before, but now with a son, he feels societal and fatherly pressure to make changes.

Next season, please!",1323561600,148,2586,4.798642533936651
