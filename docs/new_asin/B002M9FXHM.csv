3952050,4,B002M9FXHM,If you like the trinity series of movies this will be an enjoyable film. It brings the duo into a more modern setting.,1261612800,,118,4.173913043478261
3952051,3,B002M9FXHM,The reason for the 3 star rating is that this DVD has been drastically cut. At the price this DVD costs it should at least be the entire movie. I have this movie on VHS and it runs 1:48 vs. 1:30 on this DVD. This is a great movie and I think it's a shame to pay this much money thinking you are getting the full movie version. 18 minutes is a lot of cutting in my book.,1258761600,10,369,3.7435897435897436

8373652,2,B002M9FXHM,"This review pertains to the Amazon Instant version:

As some reviewers already stated this movie is cut.  Some further research shows that, unfortunately, there isn't a complete cut out there.  This film was released in different versions for different countries.  That said, this cut seems to skip plot points, and it also seems to be the shortest all together.  This DVD features an 86 minute cut.  IMDB lists the original US cut as 105 minutes long, whereas the Italian cut featured 120 minutes.  This is a fun movie, but the missing parts are obvious.

Also note the image format is actually in the correct 2.35:1 ratio, but it's not 16:9 enhanced, so the image shows up as a smaller box on HD televisions.",1339286400,2,710,4.715447154471545
8373653,5,B002M9FXHM,Finally a region 0 dvd that actually plays in a region 1 television dvd! For Bud Spencer Terence Hill fans; this is the best non-western the two have ever made.,1278288000,,160,4.366666666666666
8373654,1,B002M9FXHM,"""Piu forte, ragazzi"" -  Plane Crazy  (1972) stars Bud Spencer and
Terence Hill, mixed up in a loosely connected series of events in
the smaller cities and jungles of El Salvador, often piloting a
series of single engine propeller small aircraft.

The outstanding professional quality here, is not so much the
filming, and the airplane footage both from the air looking down,
and of various airplane stunts, but the special audio effects from
start to finish,  such as for body to body combats and in hundreds
of scenes, turning the action which is often dull, even more
interesting, and comical.  There is a nice widescreen on the DVD.

Action, suspense and excitement are all here, ranging from
break-neck speed chases in small city towns, to blows exchanged
between the protagonists and rival cliques out to torch his shack
and shatter their airplane operation, various gunplay etc.

The comical aspect seems astoundingly shy in this particular movie,
although there are a series of slapstick moments, such as the usual
animal scenes (exotic birds, and wild animals) or Spencer drinking
while piloting an aircraft ambulance during a thunderstorm, while
transporting the wounded to a hospital, or various emergency
landing scenarios at airstrips, driving away in a police car, etc.

Theres also a lack of propriety or social etiquette when
communicating with airport radar personnel, and in various
situations, to raise eyebrows.

There is a  toughness as well, from the conflicts shown, but also
the script showing one of Bud Spencer's gang passing away from
natural causes on board an airplane, later erecting a tombstone in
his honor, and visiting it while wearing pastel colored clothes.

Finally, to improve this picture, in 2010, almost 40 years later,
perhaps the 1970's violin muzac could be whittled down, even more
comedy which could have worked wonders, and a better grip on the
story, which is  sparse, not surprising as Spencer and Hill
released  2 movies per year, every single year for 15 years.",1271548800,,2073,5.0825958702064895
8373655,1,B002M9FXHM,"I got this movie because it was special to me and my Father you see we are both pilots and it was a movie we used to watch many time together till my father pass away a few years ago when I saw it on DVD I had to have it.
