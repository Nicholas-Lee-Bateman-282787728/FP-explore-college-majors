8310715,5,B001IBCS3M,"Another amazing entry from PBS's Nova series.  For many people the subject of dinosaurs conjures up visions of some steaming Mesozoic swamp with huge cold blooded lizards thundering about in a chaotic and aimless attempt to survive another day.  Arctic Dinosaurs gives you another possible side to their story.  For some time now paleontologist have been finding dinosaur fossils in polar regions of the earth, in southern Australia, Antarctica and now the far northern slope of Alaska.  In this Nova episode the focus is on two expeditions to northern Alaska with specialist from all over the world, Canada, US, UK, Australia and South Africa, contributing to the research.  A chance finding in a remote area of Alaska's North Slope led to the excavation of a work cave that gave scientist, what appeared to be, easy access to fossils encased in the permafrost.  Flooding and the fragile nature of the fossils made the ""dig"" anything but simple.  The findings led to some startling ""new"" theories on dinosaur metabolism.  Since the early days of dinosaur research there has been an ongoing debate on whether dinosaurs were ""cold-blooded"" or ""warm-blooded"" with important points being presented by both sides.  In 1978 American paleontologist Robert Bakker published an article in Scientific American titled ""Dinosaur Renaissance"" in which he focused on his new view of dinosaurs.  Bakker went on to publish his classic book ""The Dinosaur Heresies"" in 1986. While Bakker was not consulted for ""Arctic Dinosaurs"" many of these same ideas are presented.  Using state of the art CG effects Nova gives you an up close look at these polar dinosaurs and the world they lived in.  Present day north-slope Alaska rests at about 70 degrees north but in Cretaceous times may have been as far north as 85 degrees, well north of the Arctic Circle.  While the climate was warmer at that time the animals still would have had to deal with months of total darkness, sub-zero temperatures and food shortages.  How did they cope with these conditions?  Did they fast or hibernate or maybe migrate to southern climes?  Nova gives you the latest findings and theories on this controversy as well a thoughts on the KT extinction event.  All presented in this beautifully filmed, informative, peek at the polar ""terrible lizards"".

8310716,4,B001IBCS3M,"""Arctic Dinosaurs"" is a fascinating NOVA-PBS documentary about fossil finds of dinosaurs in northern Alaska, a region relatively close to the North Pole. Indeed, it was even closer during the so-called Age of the Reptiles. How could dinosaurs, large and supposedly cold-blooded, thrive under such conditions?

Painstaking research seems to suggest that the Alaskan climate during the Cretaceous wasn't Arctic, but temperate. It resembled that of the Alaskan panhandle. However, this still means that the winters were cold and forbidding. Add to this the ""Arctic night"". For various reasons, palaeontologists believe that the surprising diversity of dinosaur species found in the North Slope didn't migrate further south, but stayed put.

This opens up a lot of intriguing questions about dinosaur biology. Were they really cold-blooded, like crocodiles or lizards? Or were they actually warm-blooded? Birds, after all, are warm-blooded - and they descend from dinosaurs. Personally, I've always been fond of the idea that dinos were warm-blooded, furry and multi-coloured, so the idea of giraffe-like hadrosaurs living under the northern lights has an intrinsic appeal, LOL. (NOVA doesn't discuss their colour, though.)

""Arctic Dinosaurs"" ends with the obvious follow-up question: if dinosaurs were warm-blooded (or something close to it), why didn't they survive the climate change after the asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous? The scientists interviewed on the show suggest that the climate had began to change for the worse already before the asteroid impact. Climate change was the favoured explanation for dinosaur extinction about 30 years ago, so it's interesting to see that theory stage a little come back. In a dramatic finish, the narrator suggests that perhaps the Alaskan dinosaurs might have been the last of their kind...

Definitively worth watching if you are interested in dinosaurs, or Alaska.",1375833600,,1923,5.530612244897959
8310717,5,B001IBCS3M,"Nova documentaries have always been first rate.  I don't think I've ever seen a Nova documentary I didn't like.  This documenatary on Arctic dinosaurs is no exception.  This documentary takes us above the arctic circle to examine curious fosils scientists have found there.  We see reconstructions and animations of the fosils and discussions on the finds.  How did they live?  What did they eat?  How did they survive the polar winters?  These are some of the many intriguing questions asked.  There are several plausible sounding answers, but no one knows for sure whether they are correct.  The most intriguing suggestion is that the current theory as to how the dinosaurs became extinct has been precluded.  If the arctic dinosaurs could survive polar winters, then surely they would have been able to survive an asteroid or meteor crashing into earth and the resulting debris blocking out the sun for a while.  So how did the dinosaurs become extinct?",1277078400,4,956,5.019108280254777
8310718,5,B001IBCS3M,"Fossil evidence shows that dinosaurs lived near the North Pole.  This is a shocker given that it was assumed they were cold-blooded and need warmer environments.  Few, if not no, reptiles live up there nowadays.
Though this work is designed for an educated audience, I think little children will love it, as they do most dinosaur-related stuff.  This would be something that could be shown when a junior high or high school biology class is winding down for the holidays.
The computer graphics were amazing.  They made dull bones truly come to life.  I was amazed at how experts could look a bones that looked like rocks and say, ""Oh yeah, that's a leg bone of X species.""
In this work, they blased through rock with dynamite.  I found that shocking as I would assume that could break fossils, rather than expose them.  You know how Bart and Homer Simpson love seing things explode?  I wonder if the documentary makers purposely included that footage to lure in that Simpson demoographic.  Later, they do show the fine sweeping that I associate with digs.
The work is not diverse in terms of interviewees.  Beside one South African woman of South Asian descent, everyone else is a majority male.  Some say the pool of anthropologists is very diverse, but maybe that hasn't happened for paleontologists (sp?) yet.  The work was diverse in terms of university location.  One man from a Melbourne institution spoke with an American accent and I found that surprising.
I love the way this work examined theories and put numerous factors on the table.  This work questions the meteor-as-killer theory and some people may want to view this work just to hear that discussion.  The work said, ""Maybe there are degrees of cold-bloodedness and warm-bloodedness"" and that really made a light in my head turn on.  Still, some viewers may be disappointed at how many theories are presented with not much conclusion.  This may feel like teasing to some.",1237593600,5,1939,4.844984802431611
