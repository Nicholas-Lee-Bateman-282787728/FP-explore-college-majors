8155972,5,B000KF0GUO,"The movie We Are Marshall was Fantastic and sad, sad, sad!!!. I was on my way home from work and listening to my car radio, when it was announced that the plane carrying thr Marshall football plans, plus everyone on the plane had died! It was heart breaking.

8155973,5,B000KF0GUO,I attend this university and LOVE the story told by those so involved with the pain of loss and the triumphant return of a great football program!!  Very well done!,1399852800,,164,4.466666666666667
8155974,5,B000KF0GUO,This DVD tells what actually happened. It has interviews with the actual head coach and others who were there. No Hollywood hype or fiction.,1389916800,2,140,4.875
8155975,5,B000KF0GUO,This is very good. It clears everything up that was left up in the air. We had a student from this town on the team and he was on the plane. The coach who came on to bring the team back to life had a heart for football and he was very patient with all the new players.,1382400000,2,268,3.6379310344827585
8155976,3,B000KF0GUO,"If you already have a copy of Ashes to Glory then don't bother with this one. The only added thing is a few scenes from the movie ""We Are Marshall"" and if you've seen that movie then you don't need to see scenes of it in this. Ashes to Glory is much the better documentary.",1377043200,7,273,3.981818181818182
8155977,5,B000KF0GUO,"This movie is about how the Marshall University rebuilt their football team. It is an informational DVD, not a movie. VERY worth watching.",1353628800,,138,5.043478260869565
8155978,5,B000KF0GUO,I bought this movie because one of the priests at my church was the chaplain for the Marshall football team when this happened. The priest passed away this past year and I was hoping to see him in the movie and I wasn't disappointed. Of course he was much younger then but to see him brought me great joy. Another great purchase and I'll be shopping again.,1348617600,,356,4.3283582089552235
8155979,5,B000KF0GUO,I wanted this DVD because I graduated from Marshall and was there during this time frame and the DVD brought back soooo many memories.  Excellent service.,1329868800,2,154,4.923076923076923
8155980,5,B000KF0GUO,"Ahes To Glory is a wonderful documentary of the return of the Marshall University Football Team.  It is accurate in description of all that happened to that team and the painful grief of all of us who lived in Huntington, had been students there and was a fan of of Marshall Football.",1299456000,7,284,4.461538461538462
