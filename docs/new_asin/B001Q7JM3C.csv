3762789,5,B001Q7JM3C,"This DVD is well produced and presented. It gives the on going history to people who have survived for over 4 millennia. As a heritage, no place to ever really call home except for Israel. This is a fascinating look into God's chosen people. Let every Christian remember that it is from their history that we owe our spiritual heritage. This DVD would make a great starting point for Bible studies or classroom discussions. I highly recommend it!",1385683200,5,446,4.730769230769231

3762792,5,B001Q7JM3C,A great PBS special on the history of Jewish people.  Adisc well worth owning. I just wish it was available on Blu-ray.,1317600000,3,119,4.409090909090909
3762793,1,B001Q7JM3C,First they say Jews have been around 4000 years. Then they say 3000 years. Try 5771 years and counting folks. There are so many mistakes that I'm shocked this is not made to blur the lines of truth in order to fill people's heads with lies to further make Jews into something they are not. Lie after lie. So many inaccuracies I cannot stand it! NO this is not a good film to educate people about the Jews.,1264636800,8,405,4.205128205128205
3762794,5,B001Q7JM3C,"""The Jewish People: A Story of Survival"" is a perfect documentary for religious young adult and adult educational programs.

Writer, director Andrew Goldberg's sixty minute production features a number of well-known contributors, including Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Elie Wiesel; author Fran Lebowitz, Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, and archaeologist William Dever.

3762814,4,B001Q7JM3C,"This hourlong 2009 documentary is a typical class act from PBS. It features interviews with leading Jewish public intellectuals (Alan Dershowitz, Elie Wiesel, etc.) in addition to commentary from religious scholars from various public universities. The videography is high-gloss, featuring some nice footage of Israel past and present, and the map graphics are well done.

Beginning with the Torah or Old Testament, the film tells the story of the Jewish people's survival from Moses through the present day, focusing with special emphasis on anti-semitic movements and the emergence of the modern state of Israel as inspired by Theodore Herzl, the Hungarian rabbi who founded Zionism. Christianity and Islam are treated respectfully as outgrowths of Judaism. A lot of excellent material is squeezed into the short running time of this ambitious and mature production.

The only downside is that the documentary's visual style is flat and sleep-inducing. Unlike the History Channel and National Geographic, PBS has yet to evolve beyond the ""static photography"" approach to documentary filmmaking. With a sonorous narration, this film consists largely of still photography and artwork, occasionally sprinkled with good archival and modern-day footage. Other than the map graphics, digital effects are nowhere to be seen, and there is no effort at theatrical recreation of historical events. In summary, while it's an excellent documentary for adults and serious students, it's not a film for high school kids and younger. Like most PBS programs, this one is too mature and adult for youths, limiting its general usefulness for religious education.",1398470400,23,1646,5.527777777777778
