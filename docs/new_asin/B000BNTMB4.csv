8089582,4,B000BNTMB4,"As a UFC fan, this event had some good fights.  I bought it while I was away from home and t.v so I started collecting all of the UFC's.  It became just another DVD to the collection.",1349222400,,183,3.918918918918919
8089583,5,B000BNTMB4,This is not one of the best UFC cards but pretty close. A lot of the fights are one sided but you get some big names and fun beatdowns.,1208736000,,135,3.689655172413793
8089584,5,B000BNTMB4,"As far as MMA goes UFC constantly puts on great shows with few exceptions and is argueably the premire organization in the world because of it.  UFC 54 starts out strong with the prelim bout between James Irvin vs. Terry Martin and finishes strong with the main event between Liddell vs. Horn.  There are a lot of great finishes and just some really solid matches across the entire card.  My only gripe with the DVD is it isn't exactly full of content outside of the fights.  It goes from the tale of the tape straight to the fights without the leading up to it like the DVDs past.  That really is a minor flaw when considered how truly great the fights are overall.  To someone not familiar with the sport of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) but is interested in learning, I would recommend checking this one out with at least a rental.  The fights deserve 5 stars the content 2 maybe even less.",1143331200,,888,4.411042944785276
8089585,5,B000BNTMB4,"Wow, what a sweet knee ""no name guy #1"" delivered to ""no name guy #2"" in that preliminary fight, ha!  It was mostly luck, but it was still one of the most shattering flying knees I've seen in mixed martial arts.

The action continues with Diego Sanchez in his pay-per-view event debut, Tim Sylvia v. Tra Telligman and an unbelievable fight between Frank Trigg and George St. Pierre.  I was actually looking forward to this fight more than the main event.  Let's just say that St. Pierre is something else and I think Matt Hughes would be in trouble if they were to meet up again.

The Couture fight is a good one, as usual.  I always enjoy watching ""The Natural"" do his thing.  This guy is the Jerry Rice of MMA at 42 and he continues to impress.

Not to give too much away, but the main event is a bit lackluster.  The fight lasts a while, but it's not all that competitive.  It's exciting as hell to watch, because you know that Lidell has that ""one punch"" threat and Horn is a submission magician, but things fall into a pattern early and the flow doesn't stray far from that pattern through to the end.

This is a great set of fights!",1141084800,2,1138,4.295774647887324
8089586,3,B000BNTMB4,"UFC 54 is packed with high caliber, action packed fights.  It seems to feature a little of everything; two of the most brutal knockouts ever, battles that go the distance, one extremely dominating performance in a fight you would assume would be more even, etc.  Basically, there isn't one boring fight in the whole event.

The problem with this DVD is that literally everything but the fights is completely cut out.  The blurbs on each fighter before the match where their skills and previous fights are talked about (along with a quick word from the fighter on how they see the match going) are gone.  I've always found this to be a great way to get some pre-match background on the fighter, and even a way to get a sense of their personality & attitude in some cases. So are the interviews with Joe Rogan afterwards, the announcements of the fighters before the bought, etc.  Granted at the end of the day the fight itself is what you want to see, but what is the point of cutting everything else out?  I just hope this isn't a trend with the UFC DVD's going forward, that would be disappointing.

Nevertheless, this is still a must own.",1140220800,2,1140,4.5268292682926825
8089587,4,B000BNTMB4,"I really enjoyed this event. Lidell and Horn put on a great show. Diego Sanchez busts his cherry in the Octagon, and St. Pierre takes on Frank Trigg (WOW!). The one glaring problem with this is not the fights at all... they were EXCELLENT. The problem is that everything that was not fighting was cut out. No talking in between rounds, between fights, nothing. You only see Rogan at the very beginning of the DVD and before and after the main event. The DVD goes from 'the tale of the tape' directly to Bruce Buffer announcing the fighters (thats right... no fighter intros). After round one it immediately skips to round 2, then to round 3 etc. From the decision of the fight it jumps immediately to 'the tale of the tape' for the next fight. Some people will not mind this, but as a fan I am very bothered by this... listening to the announcers is extremely educational and they give TONS of information about what is going on in the sport.

Anyway, buy this DVD... it really is another must have.",1139443200,9,999,4.459016393442623
