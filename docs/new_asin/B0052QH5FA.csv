8454117,5,B0052QH5FA,I remember watching these on TV during the Mary Higgins Clark Suspense and Murder Hour back in the late 90's early 2000's only to have each and every one of these movies interrupted in the middle of the movie never to finish and being so frustrated that no one carried them or if they did the price was in the hundreds of dollars and their only form of payment was credit card. So glad I found these for my mom's MHC Collection!,1381190400,2,428,4.2317073170731705
8454118,1,B0052QH5FA,"I am a 55 year old retired woman who has medical issues and spends lots of time in the house so I decided to treat myself to a $41 boxed set of movies.  Instead I got a box of dvds that said they would not play on my dvd player because they are made to play in another country.  When I asked the buyer to please help, they just informed me that I should have read the entire description closer and it specified such. I was so heart broken that this is the first vendor in amazon that wasn't willing to help an elderly person living on extremely low funds.  I entrusted my money to this company and they took total advantage of me.  I advise everyone not to buy anything from them because when you have a problem as I did with the bad merchandise they sell, they will not help you and don't care.  They just want your money.  I am a christian and I don't understand this way of thinking.",1344297600,2,886,4.092485549132948
