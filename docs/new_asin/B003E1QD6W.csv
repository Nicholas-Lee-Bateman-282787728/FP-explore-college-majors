I was really excited about the second disc because I thought it would be band interviews and history, and there's a little bit of that and also some very interesting technical talk about how they get their sound (If you love J.P. you're in luck because he gets plenty of face time) but it's mostly fans gushing over how great Clutch is. And Clutch are great but it's just not that entertaining. The one cool thing about disc two is has footage from some VERY early Clutch shows (as in the second Clutch show). It's definitely worth the price, I bought mine direct from the band and got a giant sticker autographed by the band!!!",1273536000,9,714,4.542635658914729
4112623,4,B003E1QD6W,"The concert disk is great, not as good as Full Fathom Five but still worth the purchase price.  The second disk is pretty weak.  I am a huge Clutch fan and was hoping for a little more from the second disk.  I watched it once and don't see watching again anytime soon. I think that you can find better interviews with the band members on youtube.  The few fan interviews they have from the shows are really bad.  It almost seems like the second disk was an after thought and thrown together with whatever footage they had at the time.",1273449600,10,534,4.3

8395144,4,B003E1QD6W,"Clutch's second DVD release Live At The 9:30 brings together a concert and a full length documentary both primarily celebrating the legacy of the band's 1995 self titled second studio album.

The live show; Live At The 9:30, features the band live Washington DC in 2009 after the release of Strange Cousins From The West playing a show that centres around playing the entire of their self title album from beginning to end. There are a few tracks either side too, such as 'Struck Down,' 'Minotaur,' and 'The Regulators.'

The sound mix and visuals are pretty decent for a band of Clutch's size, obviously not up to the same standards as millionaire band's would be able put out, but still professional and everything you really need.

Clutch have always been an amazing live band and so as you can expect there is a lot to be said for the performance, the live versions of songs like 'Rock N Roll Outlaw,' 'Animal Farm,' and 'I Have The Body Of John Wilkes Booth,' are bursting with energy and attitude.

The documentary; Fortune Tellers Make A Killing Nowadays, clocks in at around 110 minutes and largely consists of interviews from the band, their crew members and many of their fans who are largely either saying what a great band Clutch are or why they love the Self Titled album so much. This is mixed with some making-of footage from Strange Cousins From The West and it is all framed with lots of footage of various roads and cityscapes overlaid with setlists to the tune of live recordings in the tour, including many songs not in the main concert film.

This documentary really should be good, but is just kind of a little too laid back, it doesn't really achieve anything in particular and takes a long time to not really say anything in particular either, it definitely could have been better but is still worth at least one viewing.

Overall, Live At The 9:30 is a pretty interesting DVD that Clutch fans should definitely consider buying.",1311552000,,1952,4.6763848396501455
8395145,1,B003E1QD6W,"The acoustic/blues version(s) of Basket of Eggs, Regulator, and now Tight Like That are terrible. They sound like Eric Clapton's ""Leyla"" or the horrible remake of ""Hotel California"" on the radio.

I felt physically ill when they played them as a medley for their encore. Like my heroes had been killed,but worse, they killed themselves. I have loved Clutch for decades and given them a VERY wide lee-way as far as the wussy blues crap goes, but this is the final straw.

It's bad enough that they make sucky whiney blues songs, but now they have actually tainted the memory of three AMAZING songs... it's like a double minus.",1306281600,,625,4.724770642201835
8395146,5,B003E1QD6W,if you are a clutch fan then this is awesome! the self titled album in it's entirety is played here! the movie is pretty entertaining as well!,1302393600,,142,4.296296296296297
8395147,2,B003E1QD6W,"The behind-the scenes documentary is great.

However, the audio mix on the performance dvd is sub-par and is not acceptable for a commercial audio release.",1292025600,,155,5.2
8395148,5,B003E1QD6W,"Clutch are one of the best rock/blues bands in the world and this DVD shows just how good they are live. I whent to see them a few weeks before this show was recorded and I cant wait to see them again, this DVD will fill the time until they come back to the UK. great musicians playing great music.",1277942400,3,298,3.9833333333333334
