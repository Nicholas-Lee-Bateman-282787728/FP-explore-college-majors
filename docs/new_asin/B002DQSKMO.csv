8365888,3,B002DQSKMO,"As the title suggests, if you plan to order the complete series, Don't buy this particular title. The entire DVD is taken from the series itself. You can imagine my frustration when I looked at the episode list on both packages and realized I'd bought essentially the same thing. Guess I should have researched better before buying, but hope this saves someone else the waste of money.",1313280000,7,385,4.7611940298507465
