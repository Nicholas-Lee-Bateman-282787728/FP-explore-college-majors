7923565,4,B00004U3VJ,"This video is great, because it explains a greatly illustrated explanation of why and how Vegeta became a super saiyan. Its great to see Android 19 freaked out by Vegeta's incredible power. Vegeta trained long and hard for this moment and none of the Z Fighters can believe it either. I would by this video only to see Vegeta go super saiyan.",979603200,,342,4.532258064516129
7923566,4,B00004U3VJ,The animation is cool and Vegeta looks good as a super saiyan. Android 19's voice is bad but you only hear it for a little while. The episodes are good especially the first one.,974851200,,177,4.235294117647059
7923567,5,B00004U3VJ,"In the first episode, the battle between Vegeta & android 19 continues. I like this episode because Vegeta makes the android think that  he he has a shot then, Vegeta rips his arms off and blows him away. This  really scares 20, so he runs away. In the next episode, the Z fighters go  after 20 in the mountains but can't find him. He surprises Piccolo &  takes some of his energy. Plua, the episode contains the return of my  favorite character Future Trunks. As he flies to where the others are he  notices 19's head. Trunks gets a chill when he disovers that the androids  aren't the same ones that are from the future. Meanwhile a battle between  Piccolo & 20 starts. It didn't last long as Piccolo rips 20's arm off,  & because of the arrival of Bulma, 20 made another escape. Bulma tells  them that 20 is none other than Dr. Gero! And she tells them the location of  his secret lab. In the last episode, Trunks arrives to tell everyone the  horrible news. That more androids are on the way! So they will try to stop  Dr. Gero by trying to beat them to the lab & destroy androids 17 &  18. But will they beat him there?",965952000,2,1124,4.240566037735849
7923568,5,B00004U3VJ,"I enjoyed this tape for several reasons. There is a nice fight between  Vegeta and android #19. Vegeta does something very cool to 19, but I won't  say what because it will ruin it. In this tape, Trunks returns and tells  another grim and puzzling story. I like this video because it keeps you  thinking on how trunks arrival 3 years before the androids arrival has  created, THREE NEW ONES.",965779200,,391,4.5285714285714285
7923569,5,B00004U3VJ,"*Dr. Gero* is one of the best DBZ tapes released. Trunks has returned and  we learn a few of the many secrets of the evil scientist, Dr. Gero. The  fight between Vegeta and #19 was amazing and ended well. Also, the fight  between Piccolo and #20 was awesome, but I'm not saying how it ended. This  is a must have tape if you want to stay up to date on everything that is  happening in the series.",965260800,,396,4.090909090909091
7923570,5,B00004U3VJ,"Vegeta kicks the bejesus out of android 19, I thought these guys were supposed to be tough. he bluffs to android 20 making him think that 19 hadn't stolen much energy from him, 20 probably could've beaten vegeta. but  he's a wuss and flys away, krillin give vegeta a senzu bean and vegeta flys  off to get 20. and the remaining z fighters go to help him. while they are  looking for 20 he manages to steal alot of piccolo's energy, but gohan save  piccolo and vegeta and the rest of the z fighters surround 20. after a  senzu bean piccolo wants to get a piece of 20, and beat him pretty badly.  trunks comes back and say that these aren't the droids he'd been fighting.  and bulma says that that android is dr. gero. dr.gero says that he will  release androids 17 and 18, Oh no. These are the androids trunks was  talking about. gero run off on foot and the z fighters chase after him to  try and find his lab before he releases the 2 new androids. goku is back at  home and the medicine the trunks gave him isn't working yet. will the z  warriors last against the new batch of androids, we'll find out on august  15th. damn this suspence!",964569600,6,1139,4.241860465116279
7923571,5,B00004U3VJ,"This is a great continuation to the previous tape, Invasion. Vegetta and  his new powers are no match for the androids. He overpowers android #19 and  scares #20 off. Vegetta and the others follow and find him while Goku is  trying to recover from the heart virus. Future Trunks also makes an  appearance near the end. He tells the others that the androids that they  were fighting were not the ones in his future, which are even more  powerful. At then end, the fighters try to reach Dr. Gero's lab before the  other two androids are activated. There is also a startling discovery made  about the connection between android #20 and Dr. Gero. Like the previous  tape, this is one that should not be missed.",962928000,,706,4.584
7923572,4,B00004U3VJ,"make no mistake the android saga is absolutely wonderfull, excelent battles and very nice story anfolding. The only problem is that it is amerikan nice try with the uncut versions but dialogs aand voices need lots  of work (that poor vegeta. Absolutely recomended 4 stars only becouse 5 go  to the japanise",962841600,2,306,4.865384615384615
