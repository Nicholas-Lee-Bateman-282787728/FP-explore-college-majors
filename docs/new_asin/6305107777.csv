989677,4,6305107777,"This is one of those videos I do when I want to stretch and tone rather than pump up my heart rate.  Its extremely convenient as it consists of three separate programs which are each about 20 minutes long.
Program one consists mainly of sun salutations and warrior poses.  Program Two concentrates on arm and leg stretches and balancing poses.  Program Three focuses on breathing and relaxation which are great to do to induce sleep or relieve stress. I mainly practise Programs one and Program Two.
For me, this tape is great to do when you don't want to go the whole nine yards and do a full 60 minutes, although obviously you can do all three programs if so desired.  The point is, this tape is great for a moderate workout.  Jennifer Kries is a great instructor, this is the yoga leg of her 'Method' triangle of Pilates, dance and yoga techniques to keep one and all in pretty good shape.  Her style is straightfoward and compelling; her good-natured encouragement and bright smile forces you to keep trying.
If you are a yoga beginner, it may take a while to fully understand each pose, especially the sun salutations and warrior positions.  I whole heartedly recommend Jennifer Kries companion book to this tape and all her other Method tapes entitled:  'Pilate Plus Method' which provides adequate photos and step by step instruction and explanation on all the poses---then the minimal amount of instruction employed on this tape will be appreciated and keep the flow moving as it is so intended.",1035331200,3,1503,4.753846153846154
989678,5,6305107777,"What a great tape! I love that the workouts are only 20 minutes long, a perfect length for giving yourself a good stretch every day -- esepcially if you're training in other disciplines, like weight training & cardio. Most other yoga videos are at least double the length, and I find that hard for me to fit into my workout schedule. But twenty minutes is no problem! And, a little yoga every day gets you results much faster than a lot of yoga every so often.
I came to this tape after having done Ali MacGraw's Yoga Mind & Body for a few months and did not find these workouts terribly challenging. But I wasn't looking to push myself as much as I was seeking the benefits of a daily yoga practice, so this tape suited me well.
I don't feel Jennifer Kries rushes thru the poses at all. I mean, she has to move things along, each routine is only twenty minutes. I was grateful she fit a good variety of poses into each workout, and to do this she obviously couldn't have us holding poses for any considerable length of time. So, this isn't a ""sit down and s-t-r-e-t-c-h"" tape, but more of a ""get going & feel the flow"" tape. If that's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed!
I also liked that the emphasis wasn't new-agey but more athletic -- yet graceful & gentle all the same. Jennifer shows some poses that beginners might consider challenging, but she offers MANY modifications and is constantly reminding you to stay within your comfort zone, and just trust that with repetiton, things'll get easier.
A+ for this wonderful tape!!",1023321600,2,1547,4.5088967971530245
989679,3,6305107777,"I am not too familiar with yoga and I bought this video because first I wanted to learn yoga and second I like almost all Firm tapes, especially those with Jennifer Kries as the instructor. I was a bit disappointed with  the exercises though. If you want to buy it for learning yoga, it is better  to choose another video, one that is especially for beginners and if you  want to buy it only for flexibility, then choose another one that  concentrates more on flexibility and stretching.",960336000,,487,4.563218390804598
989680,3,6305107777,"What can you say, Jennifer is Jennifer.  Always in control and always doing something well.  I have had this tape for some time and bought it when I was just beginning to experiment with Yoga.  So I started doing it  when I didn't know any better.  I have to agree with the other reviewers  that while this is a mid level tape it's not necessarily for the beginner.  Only if you don't mind not keeping up or just plain getting lost in a pose.  There are several poses where you can not see your TV and have to rely on  Jennifer's instructions.  I literally had to stop and memorize the poses  because I could not figure out what she wanted us to do from just listening  to her instructions.  Now that I have been doing this for awhile it seems a  breeze.  But as everyone likes to tell you, don't sweat it.  Go at your own  pace and do the bits and pieces you want to do.  Now that I have experience  it's the type of tape I put on when I want a quick yoga session, and no  annoying distractions between movements about my spiritual self.",957139200,6,1038,4.1725888324873095
989681,5,6305107777,"I found this video very good,jennifer Kries does a good job in instructing you,and keeping you motivated. I only started yoga a few weeks ago,without even being able to touch my toes,but now i can almost bend myself in  half!  Her video was VERY helpful,and i suggest that if you really want to  learn yoga quickly,then you should get this tape!",956534400,2,345,4.622950819672131
989682,5,6305107777,"This is one of my favorite yoga videos -- I have Bryan Kest 1-3, Yoga Zone Intro to Yoga, Yoga Zone Flex & Tone, and HAD Denise Austin's yoga tape but she talked too much.
I recommend other Method tapes such as: Target  Specifics, Precision Toning & Precision Sculpting. I only have the  tapes where Jennifer instructs -- I think she is very good and can keep up  with her.
You feel fantastic after completing Precision Yoga -- very  stretched & relaxed.",945388800,6,454,4.5
989683,4,6305107777,"This was a good video to use if you are already taking yoga classes.  it is not for early beginners, nor is it extremely advanced.  it's just about mid-level & good to use as a fill-in to your regular yoga classes.",936921600,,214,4.195121951219512
989794,5,6305107777,I've been using this video for several years. I took yoga classes after work for about a year. I really enjoyed the technique of my instructor. I spent a lot of time searching for an instructor that was as effective as she was. This video was as close as I've found.,1315526400,,266,4.235294117647059
989795,5,6305107777,My wife and I have used this DVD when we are not interested in a taxing yoga program. I highly recommend it.,1294444800,,108,3.9545454545454546
989796,5,6305107777,"I knew yoga from before but never practiced it. I have this tape and i love it.
You start it and follow it  for 60 minutes and you come out of it feeling relaxed and energized.

If you are good at yoga, then you can try to strech as much as she does.

I did this workout for 3 weeks, and I noticed my flexibility came back.
She explains the poses well and tell you what not to do as well.

I would definitely recommend it.",1269216000,,422,3.872093023255814
989797,5,6305107777,"Jennifer has a voice that lulls you and directs you at the same time.  She's very descriptive of the poses and what you should be concentrating on while attempting the positions.
The quick pace keeps it challenging during the sun salutations.
I love this yoga routine... especially the wind down at the end.",1235606400,,307,4.7924528301886795
989798,5,6305107777,This DVD is my favorite!  The mood music is very pleasant and relaxing; the routines not too challenging (although the instructor does introduce more difficult poses for the more adept).  A classic.,1143504000,,198,5.15625
989799,4,6305107777,"I've been working out for almost two years; mainly I stick to Tae Bo, but I enjoy yoga as well.  I find that it's especially helpful for flexibility, and I often find myself incorporating different yoga exercises into my warm-up/stretching routine, prior to doing Tae Bo.

""The Method Precision Yoga,"" featuring Jennifer Kries, is a great introduction to yoga for newbies.  Jennifer explains and demonstrates the poses very well, and she illustrates different levels of the same pose so that novices don't get frustrated and the more advanced students don't become bored.  The workout is divided into three segments, each roughly 20 minutes in length: Strength & Vitality, Flexibility & Balance, and Serenity.  I love each of the first two, especially Flexibility & Balance, but hardly ever do the Serenity portion.  Jennifer walks you through such poses as Warrior I and II, the Sun Salutation, Downward Facing Dog, The Cat, Child's Pose, etc. - mostly your standard yoga fare.

I own a number of yoga DVDs, and ""The Method Precision Yoga"" is invigorating without becoming impossible, like some of the ones that I've bought and hardly ever used.  More advanced yogis might want to stick with another series, perhaps the longer Rodney Yee ones (sometimes I swear Rodney gets a little help courtesy of Adobe Premiere - no one should be able to do some of those moves!).  However, ""The Method Precision Yoga"" is great for newbies and moderate-level students, and very useful if you just want a great stretching routine (some of the twists are awesome).  I'm knocking one star off for its short running time, though - I've seen a number of more interactive DVDs with twice the number of segments.",1117497600,8,1693,4.950530035335689
989800,5,6305107777,Jennifer is such an wonderful instructor.. i have recommend her tapes to bother strangers in target and friends. the yoga breathing leaves me calm and focused every time. Thanks !,1085961600,,179,5.0
989801,4,6305107777,"This is a nice addition to my collection, but is not my favorite DVD. Jennifer does not allow enough rest or even a pause between poses, so you never have time to make the mind and body connection. The routine very good through. Her sun salutation is fun and easy to follow. She holds the poses for a perfect amount of time. The ending meditation is very nice, except the camera does not show her hand position when she's explaining the breathing technique. If you're only buying 1 DVD I would suggest Yoga for Urban Living instead.
Check my other reviews on Amazon for some great yoga DVDs!",1074038400,3,591,4.481481481481482
989802,5,6305107777,"I have done some yoga and do lots of earobics, weights etc but this yoga tape is a perfect workout- she explains it and demonstrates so well- perfect pace-whether you are learning the tape or becoming more experienced it still works. Where yu can do all the postures at first doesn't matter either-as long as you do it to the best of your ability you'll get lots out of it",1054252800,5,372,4.328571428571428
989803,5,6305107777,"With a series of exercise tapes called ""The Method"", Jennifer Kries leads this 60 minute workout that is segmented into three 20 minute workouts.  I consider myself new to yoga, having worked to Kathy Smith lately.  I enjoy this video tape much more.  The moves are quick and not particularly agonizing.  Jennifer is good at cueing.
There is minimal distraction here as she works alone and the camera follows well.  The forms are not very difficult and its easy to see that with some practice, they can be done with precision.  Breathing correctly is the key also, as one can tend to hold the breath during more difficult moves.
Her first segment is titled Strength and Vitality which concentrates developing abdominal strength.
Segment 2 is Flexibility and Range of Movement and the focus is on the major muscles and joints such as hip, shoulders, pelvis, and spine.
The last is Segment 3 called Serenity and Peace of Mind.  The focus here is on relaxing the mind and body through breating exercises.
This is an excellent tape, it moves quickly and is effective....  MzRizz",1047168000,,1074,4.830601092896175

7885295,5,6305107777,"This is a great yoga practice to start on. It's broken into 3 20-minute parts, so if you're started out, you can build up your endurance to the full hour. Great explanations, and I always feel good doing this routine.

7885298,4,6305107777,"Not for the beginner.  I enjoyed this DVD.  A very good workout.  Easy to follow if you have some basic understanding of yoga poses.  Her directions were done so well you didn't even have to be watching the TV.  Challenging.  Started this tape on New Year's eve & will see how well I progress by Easter.  Not a work out I will tire of easily.  The 1st section could have been deleted, but the other 3 are great.",1389484800,,411,4.17948717948718

7885300,5,6305107777,"I had this yoga tape back in 2002 on VHS and I loved it then. I think I did it every day. I can't believe I found it again 10 years later on Amazon, I'm very excited.

I love that it is split into sections by the type of series, you can do one or all depending on your mood. Jennifer is also wonderful at narrating. She is very soothing and helpful at making sure you can follow her easily.",1356998400,,390,3.875
7885301,5,6305107777,"I got this VHS several years ago as a gift. I used it till it broke and got it again for myself. This is the tape I liked to do at the end of a frazzling day just to ring myself out and feel grounded again. I couldn't tell you how many calories you'll burn, or how advanced this tape is, but I can tell you you'll feel 100% better after doing it. After my second tape disappeared, I couldn't find it anywhere for a while. Since then I've done yoga elsewhere, but I was so happy to find my old friend again:)",1352160000,,507,3.9320388349514563
7885302,5,6305107777,"I had this on VHS years ago and have been looking for a reasonably priced dvd format. It's my favorite because it is broken down into three different 20 minute workouts (strength, flexibility and balance, serenity), so you can do one or all three at a time (flexibility and balance is my favorite). It is well paced and easy to follow. I would recommend this video for the beginner to intermediate yoga practitioner. I've tried 15 - 20 other yoga videos and I always come back to this one!",1344384000,,489,4.50561797752809

When I was 17 I took a couple of months to memorize much of this after watching other videos from the library( I mofified things I couln't do-don't be afraid to do that). This is deeply a complete routine made to teach your body, mind and energy to heal itself, physically, mentally, and spiritually. I'm 27 and teach yoga now and still highly recommend. Oh and the end is just as impotant (one of the reviewers say they skip that part)- trust me yoga is not a physical exercise alone, and remeber to breathe :)",1320364800,,569,4.277777777777778
