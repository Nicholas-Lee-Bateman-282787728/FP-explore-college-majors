8045127,3,B00076ONUA,"Satire of a costly and no-where-to-take policy of abstince-only imposed on young people in the USA is the only real stuff hypocrisy of such a practice demonstrated worldwide already.

Surely boring.",1243555200,,198,5.387096774193548
8045128,3,B00076ONUA,"the characters differences of opinion are expressed in non-sequitor emotional outbursts rather than thought-out points. sex is only talked about as an abstract concept so they're not really saying anything about it. oh yeah and i almost forgot the reason i rented it in the first place, i thought it would be funny, and it really isn't. ""backdoor. frontdoor. sidedoor."" is the only bit that made me laugh.",1176422400,,405,4.970588235294118
8045129,4,B00076ONUA,"In the midst of my promise to watch as many Oscar-nomiated films before the Academy Awards on February 25, 2007, I watched this little gem. What is it about high school movies that makes them so compelling? This movie is a very entertaining farce on the abstince-only sex education. Peer pressured to sign a pledge card to remain virginal until marriage, one girl finds a voice to question the scare tactics and the validity of abstinence-only sex education. Anyone with an IQ greater than 10 can see that in a realistic society, abstinence-only education is doomed to fail. This is totally not what I expected from a movie from MTV.",1170892800,,633,4.763636363636364

8045131,4,B00076ONUA,It's a great educational movie on how abstinance programs don't work. MTV has done a great job.,1121990400,,95,4.647058823529412
