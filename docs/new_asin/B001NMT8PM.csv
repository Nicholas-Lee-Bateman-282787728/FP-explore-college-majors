8327424,5,B001NMT8PM,"Tidbits of Terror:  The Films of John Lewis
In an office, far, far away, John Lewis plans films designed to make the most rabid Indy fans cringe with delight.
In another time, and another place, the beautiful (she knows it) and deranged Leiluna (Jamie Lea) gleefully lures sailors and innocent victims to their deaths while witnessing delightfully evil stories.  Lewis presents ""The Phone Call"" in which a drug dealer meets his death in a gruesome fashion with some social commentary thrown in for good measure.  Want a ""Permanent Job""?  Tom, the only one of four who is employed, is aloof from his friends and `dies' during a routine visit.  I think one of the three unemployed game players has a little Star Wars fetish though.  ""The Tracker"" is a mystifying story about revenge, and the spirit world.  Comic books really do come true in ""The Incredible Comic Book Murder"" as the Skunk Ape claims another victim in the swamps.  Does life imitate art?

This is a great collection of shorts seemingly inspired by Elivira, Cain, and Madame Xanadu.  Her hosting skills include a cynical attitude, a sense of humor, and a healthy self image.  The constant barrage of bodies being dropped off is amusing, and even as the dead sailor hits on her, it maintains a fascinating appeal.

Overall, another great entry from Creature Productions.
