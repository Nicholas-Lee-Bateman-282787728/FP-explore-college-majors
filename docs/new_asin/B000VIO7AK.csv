8219038,5,B000VIO7AK,"orig came out in VHS, the quality isn't HD for sure but the material is very funny and Tom's magical skills are great!",1399593600,,118,4.173913043478261
8219039,5,B000VIO7AK,"I'm not quite sure why someone would find Tom Mullica ""aw-fully boring.""  Granted, magic may not be everyone's taste but the inability to not understand or appreciate the literally thousands of hours of practice and expertise that goes with such a performance, not to mention the final result, perhaps speaks volumes.  Video quality aside - this was shot in the late 70's - this is the single remaining record of Tom performing at his legendary Tom  Foolery Magic Bar in Atlanta.  There were hundreds of like venues in those days from New York and Chicago to California.  Hardly a ""sleazy"" club, the shows were consistently sold out and attracted show business elite as well as fans of the genre.  I witnessed more than 9 shows over the span of years the club was open and aside from a very infrequent overindulgent patron (it was a bar, after all) the audiences understood they were watching a genius at the top if his game.  Great sleight of hand, off the cuff  repartee and comedy.... Everyone had a great time.  If you are a fan of close up magic, Tom is among the best and although you probably couldn't get away with some of the cigarette routines today, this is a thoroughly enjoyable performance that makes one wish it were longer.",1390262400,,1239,4.646788990825688
8219040,1,B000VIO7AK,"Gave up after 20 minutes -- lewd, asinine patter along with silly, boring card and cigarette tricks -- wonder if the boozed-up ""audience"" in the sleazy, bar-like setting got paid to stay awake and laugh at this Tom-Foolery?  Only wish I could get a refund, but of course I had to open the DVD in order to be severely underwhelmed by its contents. Of the hundreds of DVDs I've bought from Amazon over the years, this is the worst of the lot.  Hope this review helps others save their cash for more worthy items.",1365638400,,510,4.414893617021277
8219041,5,B000VIO7AK,"Expert Close-Up Magician and Bar Entertainer Tom Mullica is without a doubt the best in the world!! This DVD is superb, comical, amazing, bizarre, and extraordinarily entertaining for all your family members!

He is well missed in the Magic Community and definitely a true legend in his unique domain of unusual magic routines; which have never been replicated by any! I highly recommend this DVD, trusted seller and great shipment! Trust me, you will treasure this DVD for years to come...

8219042,5,B000VIO7AK,I've seen Tom on TV many times and met him after a show in Vegas a few years back.  He is truly the most entertaining magician I have seen (and I have seen them all); who else would eat burning cigarettes but Tom!,946598400,,213,3.953488372093023
