4526596,3,B0051ZH6FG,"Emilia is a young lawyer from a prominent New York City family.  Her father was a judge and her mother is genuinely devoted to her daughters and their families.  From the very start of her promising career (Emilia is an Ivy League School Graduate), Emilia chooses to get involved with her married boss.  There is very little that we know about his character and professional abilities, other that he is a partner in the law firm they both work at and he is handome middle-aged , well-to-do man.  Eventially, the two end up getting married together to a great resentment of Jack's ex-wife and even his young son.  But in spite of initial passion between the two, Emilia's youth and cleverness, there is a tension in this young marriage because, as we slowly learn it, Jack and Emilia have lost their newly born daughter Isabella to SIDS and that event seems to spiral everything down.  In her grief over the loss of her daughter, Emilia takes no prisoners and she lashes out on anyone around her: her immediate family, husband and her friends.

This movie is an inetresting exploration about marriage and parental grief.  But, it is not by any means a match to a movie ""Rabbit Hole"" that seems much more genuine in its raw emotion.",1307404800,12,1230,4.635944700460829

4526598,2,B0051ZH6FG,"In this film Lisa Kudrow was the star!  This was the most believable role in the movie.  Every aspect of this role was portrayed truly real -- or how should she have acted being replaced by a still younger and really not so admiring person (Portman)?  Her change for a moment toward the end when she tries to help Portman is again a wonderful demonstration of her capacity to portray emotion and understanding in spite of being dumped.  We should see more of Kudrow in many more movies ..

Portman played, as she did in Black Swan, the perverbial helpless soul, despite personal issues, wanting to please all and suffering throughout.  The role portrayed a youngish and immature female ...we have 2011 -- are women still doing that? Whoops..  Cohen's best line was at the end telling her it's too late to fix it...

Natalie Portman should be allowed stronger roles... ""V"" was still her best to date",1307232000,7,898,4.639240506329114
4526599,3,B0051ZH6FG,"This movie will be enjoyed by most women. Most men will not enjoy it. Natalie Portman gives a great acting performance. The movie is kind of ""slow and dull"" in parts and there is no action.",1307145600,,189,4.277777777777778
4526600,4,B0051ZH6FG,"I'm sick of dramas that portray family life with the same Hollywood cliches. In that respect,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Woman/dp/B004O26LAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Woman</a>&nbsp;is a relief. Natalie Portman plays a young lawyer who has an affair with and eventually marries an older partner. She inherits his son William, who is somewhat difficult to get along with to say the least. What I really appreciate is that the movie doesn't shy away from presenting a messy, complicated - and realistic - family life. None of the characters are perfect, but none of them are wholly evil either. There are no villains or heros. Natalie Portman's acting is spot on, with a mix of emotional wreck and sassiness. Charlie Tahan also does a great job with William as the aloof but lovable child. I don't usually go for these types of dramas, but this one is executed well enough to make it worth checking out.",1306368000,5,970,5.473333333333334

4526602,4,B0051ZH6FG,"Natalie Portman gives a powerful performance as this woman, whose husband was married before and has a stepson with  whom she clashes now and then.  His mother doesn't help either.  And then there's the fact that Portman has suffered a horrible loss along with her husband which I will not spoil here.  Complications abound in this emotional and well-acted story.",1306108800,2,363,5.0
4526603,5,B0051ZH6FG,"Can you love someone's son after you lost your daughter?  Emilia's (Portman) relationship with her husbands son is strained after the death of thier 3 day old daughter.  To make matters worse his ex wife (Kudrow) is doing her best to turn the son against her.  This is a very heartbreaking movie to watch and it is a little difficult to make it through.  Much more devastating then ""Rabbit Hole"".  Portman is incredible in this and actually should have won the Oscar for this and not ""Black Swan"" (though she did deserve it).  Although this is a very hard movie to get through it is entirely worth it and you will be glad you watched it.  This is not a typical Hollywood movie and that's why it is so good.  Very heart-wrenching and moving.  It will make you examine your life to decide what is important.  When you watch this make sure you don't have plans after, it will bring you down, though the ending is a little uplifting.  I really enjoyed this movie, much more then I thought I would.  I give it an A.

Would I watch again? - I might, but it would be tough.

4526604,5,B0051ZH6FG,"THE OTHER WOMAN is a film that is a bit difficult to watch both because of the thematic material and because of the uneven quality of the film itself. Based on the novel LOVE AND OTHER IMPOSSIBLE PURSUITS by Ayelet Waldman (the original release of this film in 2009 used this title) and adapted for the screen by writer/director Don Roos, the story deals with SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome), divorce, step-parenting, the legal vagaries that surround divorce and remarriage, and loss. One of the reasons the film didn't make it on first theater release is that it was advertised as 'A comedy/drama that details the story of a woman's difficult relationship with her stepson.' Yes, that is a small part of the story, but this film is hardly a comedy and in fact it seems to have difficulty in deciding just what the main story is!

The opening credits begin with images of an infant girl but as soon as the action begins we are introduced to Emilia (Natalie Portman) and her husband Jack (Scott Cohen) and son William (Charlie Tahan) There is an undefined tension that is soon explained through flashbacks: Emilia fell in love with Jack who was married to OB/GYN physician Carolyne (Lisa Kudrow) and the love affair quickly developed into Jack's divorcing Carolyne and marrying Emilia. The newlyweds promptly had a baby girl who lived only three days, leaving Emilia in a prolonged state of grieving and denial. Carolyne is a controlling viper and makes the couple's life miserable, refusing complete visitation privileges with William, creating a toxic relationship between Emilia and her 'stepson' William. Emilia's friends (Lauren Ambrose and Anthony Rapp) try to make Emilia's life easier but the friction between Emilia and William as well as the constant interference by Carolyne eventually lead to a collapse in Emilia's and Jack's relationship. Some 'truths' come out about the death of Jack an Emilia's daughter and the response to those statements changes everyone in the story - including Emilia's divorced mother and father. Lessons in how to forgive and how to love complete the story.

Natalie Portman proves her acting chops in this difficult, multidimensional role and her performance is enhanced by that of Charlie Tahan as the young William. The rest of the cast is not of the same caliber, failing to make us care about their characters enough to find their significance in this rocky script. Though there are many flaws in the film making it seem to drag on too long (almost two hours), the opportunity to see the gradual growth of the acting career of Natalie Portman is reason enough to watch this little New York relationship drama.

If you are brave enough to engage with the content, you are guaranteed to be rewarded with an amazing experience, as this movie pulls together so many elements of the human experience, and does it in a manner that never feels artificial or trite. For me this was this most rewarding cinematic experience in a long time, even though I found it difficult to watch at times, such was the affect it had on me emotionally. Portman has been impressing me quite a bit of late, and for my mind, this is her best work to date, and in the process she has set the bar high for others that follow. I've never been much of a fan of Lisa Kudrow (other than in Friends), and was admittedly disappointed to see her cast in this, but she turned out to be outstanding in her part as the bitter and hateful ex-wife. I could go on, and on, about the cast, as I really can't think of any movie where I was impressed with every single performance, but this is one where I was.

Do yourself a favor, buy a box of tissues, and a comfortable place to sit, because this is a journey that will enrich your life, and not merely take up some space in it.",1424044800,,1374,4.200757575757576

4526657,4,B0051ZH6FG,"Director Don Roos (Happy Endings) and actress Natalie Portman (Black Swan) turn to Ayelet Waldman's novel for a fresh take on the other-woman melodrama.

In adapting Love and Other Impossible Pursuits, Roos starts after the affair and the marriage between 2 well-heeled New Yorkers, but there's no happily ever after for Emilia (Natalie Portman), a legal associate, and Jack (Scott Cohen), an attorney, because their baby succumbed to sudden infant death syndrome.

Through an extended flashback, Roos fills in their story. Now their lives revolve around his sensitive 8-year-old son, William (Charlie Tahan), with his chilly ex-wife, Carolyne (Lisa Kudrow). If Emilia has trouble dealing with the loss, William has no such qualms, and can't understand her inability to move on. Then again, every time Emilia thinks she's made a breakthrough with the lad, something goes wrong, leading him to declare, ""You're not sophisticated like me and my mom.""

Fortunately, Emilia has her mother (Debra Monk), sister (Elizabeth Marvel), and friends (Lauren Ambrose & Anthony Rapp) for support, though they're no match for Carolyne, whose resentment of Emilia would be more understandable if the screenplay didn't make her so unlikable--but she does get to reveal a flicker of humanity towards the end.

Still, this is Portman's show, and she's very good in depicting the various stages of Emilia's grief, particularly in her scenes with Tahan. If ""The Other Woman"" lacks the director's customary humor, that adds to the sweetness of the resolution.",1390780800,,1537,5.338842975206612
4526658,5,B0051ZH6FG,"Yes ... it's a hard subject. .. But after the opening credits WHICH MUST NOT BE MISSED ... and the scene behind it ... it becomes
twice wonderful, despite the subject matter... which comes much later in the story. I watched, as ( wordless ) Natalie Portman portrayed a woman holding and touching her newborn ..... with such love... and such subtle emotion - the intensity and beauty of the moment brought back the feelings of love I felt with my own child, at such a moment - 48 years ago. Of course I cried. I sobbed, actually, from the sheer beauty of the emotions I felt, watching Portman show yet another facet of the gem of an actress that she is - and the movie had not begun. I'm a big fan of this young woman who never fails to produce a marvelous piece of acting. Whether she is in a comedy, a romance,a thriller .....she is always true to the role she has taken... and adds something wonderful. Yes .. the
movie eventually continues to tell the story of SIDS and the effect on a young woman with a family she has married into.. But it's
worth the subject to see such lyrical acting. I think it made the entire movie easier to watch .... that one moment in time says it all.",1388707200,,1183,4.262222222222222
4526659,4,B0051ZH6FG,I enjoyed Portman's work in this movie. It was an excellent insight into how people can only see things from their own perspective and rarely take the time to look at their situation from an outsider's point of view. Adult situations that could be confusing for children.,1385683200,3,271,4.787234042553192
4526660,2,B0051ZH6FG,"The shots of Central Park are the best part of the movie.  Unfortunately that's not enough reason to sit through the whole thing....maybe just fast forward to the Woolman Skating Rink with the trees just turning Autumn colors in the background.

Natalie Portman is beautiful but her character is so unsympathetic that I had a hard time feeling anything for her.  She's New York hip, a lawyer, Harvard grad, has a smart mouth and wears beautiful clothes. And she's Mother Teresa compared to the Lisa Kudrow character but that's not saying much. Kudrow's character, as awful as she is, is at least funny.  She has that arrow sharp way of delivering a line that stikes me as hilarious even when she's really being mean. And she's a relief from self-pitying, mopey Portman.

For me, it's essntial to like a character if I'm going to watch a whole film about them.  Maybe this character is really a great person but the film doesn't show it.  All we see is a spoiled, superficial, rich girl who only thinks of herself.  Some people may identify with her or be impressed by her but I wasn't.  I shut the film off after about an hour.  Maybe it got better at the end but I'll never know or care.",1378339200,,1188,4.509345794392523

4526665,2,B0051ZH6FG,"This movie was a major disappointment. As a big fan of Natalie Portman, I was pretty hopeful. I considered this movie an hour and 42 minutes that I will never get back because it was dull, unrealistic, and not at all what I had expected. I was expecting a movie about a man who is happily married and constantly cheats on his wife with some hopeful mistress, then the movie would turn into some sort of twisted thriller. You know, your average deranged Lifetime movie. But no, the movie was basically the story of a woman easily transitioning her life to be married to a recently divorced married man that she was having an affair with, and somehow they all live happily ever after. Because it always works out that way, right? The married man always leaves his wife for his mistress and they both ride off into the sunset, right? Nope, definitely not even close. The unrealistic plot of this movie was ridiculous. Where was the conflict? The only thing that seemed to REALLY go wrong was that the main character lost her newborn baby, and what the hell does that have to do with being the other woman? The title has almost NOTHING whatsoever to do with the plot! I was looking for some serious drama and a possible life-or-death situation between the married guy, his wife, and his mistress, and there was almost 0% of that. And then they tried to throw a ""curve"" at us when the main character (Natalie Portman) is convinced that she killed her baby by accidentally smothering her. This part just ticked me off because it was almost towards the end of the movie, and I really didn't see the point in throwing that part in there. It was completely pointless. Seriously? After all the time you're just now telling your husband you think you might have killed the baby? Wow.

All in all, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Not only was it one of the most boring movies I have ever seen, but it almost gives the impression that going after a married man works out for everyone in the end. Since when has having an affair ever been a good thing? Really? Unless you have an hour and a half to kill, and you've run out of phone apps and cards to play with, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It's a serious waste of time. That is all.",1373673600,5,2227,4.418491484184915

4526671,1,B0051ZH6FG,"This was probably one of the worst movies I have seen this year.  As depressing as its themes, it was so bad, it actually made me laugh several times.  The themes of the movie are heavy, but the way in which the themes are handled is so far from real life and real people, that it's hard to find this movie depressing.  I must also admit that I had to give up on the movie at a certain point, because I could not take a single more second, so my review is somewhat limited to what I actually could bear to watch.

First of all, the divorce between the male lead and his wife and his remarriage all seem to happen within a few short months.  Umm, yeah.  A partner in a law firm and a doctor wife: extremely doubtful even under amicable terms -- and this was no friendly parting.

Second, as with most Hollywood films, the romantic relationship is given short shrift.  We have no idea why these people are in love.  Lust?  Yes - it's the typical young girl/older man with power dynamic.  But we are never shown how these people came to love each other.  The relationship is completely unbelievable.

Third, the relationship between the stepchild and the woman who broke up his parents' marriage is patently absurd.  The somewhat older child, who is maybe 10 years old, seems to instantly bond with Portman after a putting up a weak and quick-lived resistance.  He even seems to side with her against the ex-wife at certain points.  Again, completely unrealistic.

In addition, the ex-wife is portrayed as a cold bitch, when she is probably the only sympathetic character in the whole movie.  However, even her character is completely unrealistic.  She has an extremely sharp tongue towards Portman, obviously justifiably so, and yet is willing to go out of her way to help her in the end.

The way Portman's parents embrace the husband she stole from another woman is yet another in a long line of absurdities.  In fact, no one in the whole movie seems to have a problem with the 20 something Portman having an affair with a 40 something partner in the law firm and causing the breakup of his marriage.  No judgments except from the ex-wife, who is portrayed as in the wrong somehow.

This is yet another movie inexplicably written by human beings, who have no idea what real human turmoil, emotions, relationships, or experiences are like.  A computer would have done a better job at depicting the characters and situations involved in this film.",1357603200,16,2445,4.593533487297922
4526672,3,B0051ZH6FG,"This was a slice of life that isn't generally shown in the movies. That makes it interesting, but I didn't think it was very well done because you could see the acting. Things felt scripted, neat, and formulaic. The attention paid to serious issues was scant when they are actually pretty deep things that deserved exploration. It felt very much like a surface treatment.

I thought Kudrow's character was written a bit unrealistically, but she did an excellent job with what she was given.

If you are interested in seeing a realistic view of what it might be like to be the other woman, this could be it. I didn't find it particularly entertaining, enlightening or moving, but it was okay. Different strokes for different folks.",1353542400,5,730,4.785714285714286

The new couple struggle with the loss of thier three day old baby, his high maintenance son, and a less than co operative ex-wife. Scott Cohen takes of the role of Jack, a high power NY lawyer.

And the rest of the movie is all about dealing with the tragedy.  But it's endearing.  You feel for Natalie Portman's character.  You feel for the rest of the family.

4526676,3,B0051ZH6FG,"I love Natalie Portman and was unaware that she had done this movie until I saw it on amazon.  It's a heavier-toned movie; a baby dies and there is a step-son who you feel bad for one minute, then dislike the next.  I feel there are good performances by all; with the exception of Lisa Kudrow who was excellent.  I very much enjoy seeing her in roles so far from Phoebe (like Wonderland) and I feel she did a phenomenal job as the jilted ex-wife.  That being said, I feel this movie was just ok.  Maybe I need to watch it more, I don't know, but it was only $4 so I don't regret adding this to my library.  If you are interested, it's cheaper than renting and who knows, you might love it!",1337904000,,689,4.104477611940299

4526679,4,B0051ZH6FG,"I came across this movie by accident and I almost didn't watch it when I saw that it was considered a comedy/drama.  That is incorrect.  This movie is not a comedy.  It acutally dealt with some very serious issues.  There is no humor in infidelity, divorce, dysfunctional relationships,and most of all, the death of a child.  This movie has all of that and than some.  I won't give a review of what it was about, others have already done that.  But I will say that it's a very real movie, filled with some intense emotions that a few time had me on the verge of tears.  I think for those of us who have lost a child, this movie hits home and heart.  My nephew only lived for one day, 26 years ago, and as she floated her waffer in the water after the memorial walk, I wished that I was there to float one for Anthony.",1319500800,7,817,4.1528662420382165
4526680,4,B0051ZH6FG,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

This movie from 2009 was filmed prior to Black Swan and, unfortunately, not released in many theaters, if at all. It's a well-written drama. SPOILER ALERT!!! The kid William is so hard to like, because he's an uptight, snooty little son-of-a-b---- just like his b---- mother. Emilia tries hard to love him, but he just pushes her away. I wish there had been a scene or a montage of William and Emilia getting closer and finally William breaking out of his mother's control and loving Emilia. Example: a scene of William crying in his room and Emilia coming in and taking him in her arms and rocking him would have worked. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! Could have had the relationship between Emilia and William develop further, but that's just me talking. Ms. Portman was excellent as usual. I really liked the scenes where she tries so hard to love William and acted maternal & loving around him. sweet. too bad he was such a stuck-up little b------ throughout the film. SPOILER!!! Even William's response to Emma's sincere ""I love you"" seemed cold and distant. SPOILER OVER!!! I HATED the scenes where he hugs his dad and only wants him and not Emilia. so disgusting. However, see it for Ms. Portman. Rated R.",1318896000,,1251,4.6863636363636365

4526682,5,B0051ZH6FG,"The Other Woman starring Natalie Portman really caught me by surprise. I have never really been a fan of Portman until The Black Swan but she gives another amazing performance in this romantic drama. Portman's character is sullen, selfish, and depressed ever since the death of her 3-day old baby girl. There are some really beautiful moments in this film. Lisa Kudrow also stars in this film, I felt her performance was a bit over-the-top until the final scene she has with Portman. The Other Woman is highly underrated film, definitely worth checking out. Enjoy!",1317945600,,564,4.947368421052632

4526686,4,B0051ZH6FG,"No plot discussion here. Only high level message reviews from me.

Not a love story but a life story. So much of what we create in life is great mythology. This story hits on some of that.  Including the age old question...where do babies go when they die and is there a heaven or hell? I love Natalie Portman and each time I see her in a role I wonder where she pulls this range of anger from. This film is a great story about anger and guilt and creating new life, bonds, and family ties.  It is about truth and forgiveness.

Lisa Cudrow is amazingly hateful in this movie so you know she plays her role as the scorned ex-wife to the hilt. It is a lovely ensemble piece and although it doesn't dive deeply into the emotional reasons behind all of the anger, it does reveal enough of the back story to help the audience understand that the guilt we harbor over our action(s) or the anger the drives us can sometimes cause the life journey we are on to come to a painfully slow and screeching halt.  Life cannot continue on its course until the tracks are cleared to move forward. In the end, love has not so much to do with it as the other matters of truth and forgiveness.  That is the secret of this movie.  The nugget you get to take if you are paying attention to what is not being said.  Enjoy.",1311638400,4,1300,4.192771084337349

4526688,5,B0051ZH6FG,"I loved this movie.  It's an intelligent movie, well written, excellently directed and the performarces are flawless.  Very real, in part, it ends the myth that the wife is always the good one and the one who is always right.  It shows that the love of an affair can be real, and at the end of the movie, they have a fresh start but not out of infidelity, which in my opinion is the right way to start a relationship.

It caught my attention the fact that Love is by far a bigger and stronger bond between a man and a woman than children.  They fell in love, they lost their daughter, they grieved the loss.  They struggled, got separated.  But, then they started all over again, because they still loved each other.  Love is the strongest bond and force in our lives.",1310256000,,768,4.321678321678322

4526691,5,B0051ZH6FG,"Natalie Portman showed another level of her range with her performance in ""The Other Womam,"" a movie about the dramas of ex-spouses, learning to live with step-children and getting over past tragedies. The story takes quite a few good twists along the way, especially when a few new characters enter play and shed some new light on an old subject, which helps clean up some messes and tie up the movie nicely.",1309132800,,409,4.694444444444445

I was expecting a movie that was so-so about infidelity - heck, I thought Natalie might be the wife that was wronged... anyhoo - I was absolutely off base.  This movie is nothing like I expected and I am so glad I gave it a chance.  The interplay of the actors and the richness of the story were wonderful! It showed real relationships, real emotions, and real problems.  Not another Hollywood ""cookie cutter"" formula screenplay, this was real life and sometimes bad things happen and things don't always turn out rosey.  I'm sure many people will skip this movie because it's not a ""feel good, happy ending"" kind of flick, but if you want to see a moving story give it a try.",1307491200,4,766,4.482014388489208
