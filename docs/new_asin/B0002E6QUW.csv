8182469,5,B0002E6QUW,"This is probably the greatest movie ever made.  It all takes place in a small redneck community where two groups of kids are battling for the the Saline County Decatholon.  A midget named ""BAD"" tries to spoil the competition by getting the town to bet illegally against the competition.  The big winner is Billy who struggles to overcome a mysterious knee injury as well as ""The Captain"" who tells a lovely and inspiring story that involves treating people with respect, friendship, and bravey.  Also, Greg learns the values of the boombox and how to socialize with the young ladies.  Best movie ever next to ""Point Break.""",1119916800,3,623,4.839622641509434
8182470,5,B0002E6QUW,"To put it simply this movie blew me away! It's about an epic
journy a group of friends share in order to bring pride to their towns name and each other, but don't be fooled it is not an easy journey. Along the way they have to battle evil corparations, rival towns, and they even have to test each others friendships. I found this movie to be very exciting and was on the edge of my seat most of the time, and somehow amongst all the excitment some humor was approeriately added in. Not only was this movie exciting and funny, but it will leave you wondering what will happen to the little marines next.",1052092800,2,603,4.252173913043478

8182472,1,B0002E6QUW,"This movie by far was the worst piece of filmmaking to ever project itself on screen. The acting in the first movie was exceptionally accurate, depicting the lives of small-town Arkansans. In the second film however, the stomach-churning excuses for performances delivered by this group of actors is enough to make even the most knavish of moviegoers severely question the poor judgements of these so-called ""professional"" directors. The movie appears to be shot by a thrice-pawned home-video camera, and the styles of the clothes make the audience feel as if they were at Mullet Fest '92, not to mention the scenery is clearly pine trees drawn onto a cardboard refrigerator box. In the last twenty minutes of the movie, the words "" Don't do drugs "" are used in what seems to be every other sentence emitted from Stephen Baker's mouth. The themes of the movie are stated obviously and unambiguously, creating an unintended but biting insult to the intelligence of the audience. This movie serves a better purpose as kindling rather than an avenue for entertainment.",995500800,,1065,5.022598870056497
