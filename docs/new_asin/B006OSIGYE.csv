8502186,5,B006OSIGYE,"This video of tai-chi for Kids is the best purchase ever!!
The way in which is done is easy to follow and very educational.  I have seen an
amazing response from children and a lot of interest even from adults!!
I have done it many times with my child and her friends.  I can see the difference
with them in calmness and focus, don't we all want that for our children?!
It is worth far what the price is, it is priceless!",1338595200,5,421,4.121951219512195
