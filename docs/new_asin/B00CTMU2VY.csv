8586108,1,B00CTMU2VY,"Looking for an exciting thriller? A couple of hours of entertainment? You won't find it here.  This film was a complete waste of running time and my lifespan.  The family isn't even likable, so it's impossible to find sympathy for them.  Well, perhaps the little daughter, although her character is the usual ""I'm an adult and wrote what I think a kid her age would act like"" caricature. (Hint: most kids quit calling their mothers ""mommy"" by her age, and they don't have the reedy, near-baby talk voices, folks).  The dad never loses his arrogant, swaggering bully persona AND he never apologizes to his family for what he has put them through.  The wife has ONE confrontation with her husband, but it's all about her, not her kids, who are losing all their friends and their hopes for their own futures.  The son seems to grow a backbone for all of five minutes, then oh-so-sweetly-should-warm-your heart-but-doesn't gives in to love and loyalty and meekly follows his parents.  A real teen would have more of a confrontation, and act a hell of a lot more upset about the opportunities he will now never get, including a good college education.

Sizemore's character accepts his family's love as his due, and never apologizes for what he put his wife and family through.  He just makes excuses.  Given that he's already an accomplice to multiple murders and slew of other felony crimes, there is no way you'll feel an ounce of sympathy for him.  His wife is a woodenly (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is wasted here) played arm trophy who, I suspect, would willingly sacrifice her kids for her husband.

Forest Whitaker is the only character for whom I could muster a grain of compassion.  He has the thankless task of trying to save their ignorant, worthless, arrogant behinds, and is never thanked by the kids or the wife, and the husband grudgingly shakes his hand.  What a waste. (have I said that yet?)

Don't waste your time here.  Action? Nothing approaching the thriller that this film claims to be. Emotion? Nothing that will jerk your heartstrings.  Verdict: Simply Awfu",1488844800,,2079,4.811267605633803
8586109,4,B00CTMU2VY,"While not my normal genre, this movie was a startling surprise.
The message alone was moving, and though at times, the actors could have pulled the scenes together a bit better, I think they did a great job.
The story itself was good, though it seemed to me that some parts may have been left out, whether on purpose, or not, the story was still clear and intense.
Only down side I could see was that the opening credits seemed to go on forever, but the opening music was great!
Would highly recommend this movie for anyone swaying between good and evil, belief and ambiguity, or even anyone needing confirmation in hope and humanity.",1239235200,3,634,4.5701754385964914
8586110,4,B00CTMU2VY,"Plot:  The premise and thought behind the story are great. A solid message to deliver.

Acting: The acting lacks the ability to engage, but is not bad overall. To be expected with unknown talent.

Directing/Editing:  Would appear that the director/editor has been severely influenced by the Hollywood-popular-rubberstamp products of the late '80s early '90s.  The potency of the film's message tends to get lost sometimes in the rough transitions and limited camera handling.

Overall: Film has a great message, unfortunately it is one that will be rarely heard.  Films like this tend to speak to one demographic, the Christian family types.  The tremendous value of the message will be limited to the 'choir.'  If only those on Hollywood would dare to make such a film that challenges all that they embrace.

Reccomendation:  Definately check it out, and if you are outside the demographic mentioned above, I challenge you to buy and share this film.",1236816000,3,951,5.1103896103896105
