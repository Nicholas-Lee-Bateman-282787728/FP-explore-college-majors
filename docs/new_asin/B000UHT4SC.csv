My grandfather is Fred Baker and we had VHS versions of this but we have all watched them so many times that they barely work, not to mention how hard it is to find a VCR these days! It brought tears to my eyes this morning to get to hear my grandpa's voice again! Thank you!!",1447459200,,329,4.0
8354741,4,B000UHT4SC,"Documentary about what was really a bigger and closer attack on America than Pearl Harbor but was for some reason kind of buried by the government at the time and ignored by history teachers since.  Must watch if you want to say you know anything at all about World War II.  Not the action of a plotted movie, but good concrete information and lots of authentic footage.",1243555200,,370,4.507462686567164
