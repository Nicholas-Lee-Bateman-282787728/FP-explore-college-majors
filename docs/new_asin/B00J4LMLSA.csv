6333374,2,B00J4LMLSA,"There were a lot of production companies involved in the making of this flick and I had to ask myself: Why would anyone bother spendind so much time, money and effort to make a movie without so much as one original idea going for it?

Here's the scoop. Man, his son, and new wife visit their second home in a very rural area. It seems the home had been broken into by some squatters. Next thing you know, the son has been abducted and the ""squatters"" proceed to assault and try to kill the two adults.

This is unbelievable. You can sit and watch scene after scene and know, immediately, where they ripped each scene from. There's ""Ils/Them"", ""The Shining."" ""Mamma,"" and many more. And the basic premise for the plot makes no real sense. The idea is that these marauders steal this kid, as well well as a young girl in the opening grizzly assault to give them family. Okay. Maybe the first girl because her and her family have been in the house a long time where there was time to observe them and see the familial disquiet. But this new family has just arrived. There is no way for them to know what the family situation is like. And of course each killer wears a mask. Why? They're out to kill everyone. Who cares if they're seen or not? But all the methods and near escapes are hackneyed to the enth degree.

But this is actually more frustrating in that it was actually made rather well. The acting is provided by a troop of veterans. (Though I can't see why Steven McHattie took the gig. Unless he really needed the paycheck). He' gets killed the second time you see him. It's shot and directed well and even the music score is good. So, again, why jump through hoops to make a film so utterly unoriginal?

Unless you need to see every horror movie ever made I'd give this stinker wide berth.",1419033600,,1797,4.37125748502994

6333376,1,B00J4LMLSA,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS

How many times have I seen this exact same movie? ""Torment's"" biggest failure is that it brings NOTHING new and good to the genre, but repeats all that is bad with these types of film. Characters we don't care about, seemingly invincible mutant killers who somehow move like Navy Seals despite being deformed and wearing masks with extremely limited vision, and protagonists who repeatedly separate, drop weapons as soon as they pick them up, and leave the killers alive when they could have ended them once and for all. You have a problem with your movie when I find myself wishing all the characters would die ASAP so the movie could end. Highlights included: the woman- I don't even care what her name is- finally gets an okay weapon, a flare gun, and then begins to wander aimlessly in the woods, periodically firing the flare gun in the air to have about three seconds of poor visibility but to be sure anyone who wants her dead and who are within ten miles know exactly where she is. Highlight two: As mentioned elsewhere, the plastic bag the stupid father could have bitten through in a millisecond but almost suffocates him, and Highlight three: The ""seen this a million times and it was stupid every time"" ending where the police leave the extremely dangerous mutants either unguarded in ambulances or unsecured with one cop in the back of a cop car. Very funny part when the officer stops when someone throws a rock at her window, does not call for backup, leaves killer in back seat, and casually exits car with not a care in the world despite the pile of bodies and lack of information about what the threat really is. Sad, sad excuse for a ""horror"" movie.",1418428800,,1690,4.633333333333334

WOW, I have regretted renting or having seen a few movies in the past across the board not giving no particular place. But this one here just move itself to the top of my list as regrets. I could not get into it, and I am a big fan of the ""You're Next"" and alike movies. There was nothing that I like about it. It was not original in nothing. I kept waiting for the suspense to pick up something that wasn't predictable to happen, but it didn't. Perhaps it did doing the two times I fell asleep watching it.

6333395,1,B00J4LMLSA,"Lousy home invasion thriller finds a husband, son and new step-mom being terrorized by violent squatters wearing animal masks.  It's hard to ignore the superficial similarities to You're Next but the movies couldn't be more different in tone (You're Next is playful while Torment is dreary) and quality (none of the suspense sequences in Torment generate suspense).

The killers are given a shaky motive that is never sufficiently developed, so they end up being generic and completely interchangeable--I couldn't even tell you how many killers there were.  The members of the family we are supposed to be rooting for are all annoyingly stupid (another big difference from You're Next, which hard a smart heroine and intelligent villains with a clear purpose).  Katherine Isabelle as the step-mom is meant to be the heroine but the movie has her doing dumb things pretty much right up until the end--she doesn't manage to outsmart even one of animal masked characters, which is a pretty good indicator of how terrible the script is.

Torment is boring and beyond Katharine Isabelle (American Mary; Hannibal) the acting is pretty lousy.  Unless you are a huge fan of home invasion films or Katharine Isabelle this is not a movie you want to waste your time on.  Watch You're Next again instead.",1404086400,3,1293,5.014018691588785

For crying out loud, it opens with a set piece where a killer massacres a family using secateurs. How often do you see people killing each other with secateurs in the movies these days? Seriously, not at all.
Honestly, though, it's a movie that tries for a lot and comes out strong in all categories. Nothing mind blowing here, nothing you haven't seen beforeexcept perhaps the secateursbut if you want a freak out scare, it'll do the job.",1403913600,2,590,4.628571428571429

In my opinion, this film is very good. However saying that doesn't mean it is Oscar worthy. It is a fun saturday night film that is intense, creepy and sometimes very violent. Katherine does an amazing job as the worried stepmother and makes some actual smart decisions (which is rare in home invasion films except for You're Next) The only complain is one actor: The child(Peter Chacula or something) He is SO DAMN ANNOYING. Literally the whole time it's NO BRING BACK MOMMY NO YOU CAN'T TOUCH THIS. I was ready to shut it off the whole entire time. What makes up for this is the masks. Those almost made me shart my pants. Gives me goosebumps thinking about it. All in all, this is a very good horror film and the ending will make your Jaw drop.

6333399,4,B00J4LMLSA,"What a surprise! About friggin' time! First, if you at all, like me, balk at movies that have a kid in the protag or attached to the protag seat, as they usually PG13ify movies, don't worry about that here. While the initial set up had me worried, the kid goes missing soon into the film (its in the synopsis so not a spoiler). From that point forward, the movie is definitely maturely themed.

There were effective horror visuals, primarily attached to the antagonists, who wore hooded costumes. The look was menacing. The setting also contributed to the atmosphere well. It had a bit of a haunted feel to it.

The story is not fleshed out much. Its a basic survival film. Not much in the psychological department. The film title immediately brought to mind the Japanese films, Tormented, then Shock Labyrinth, and even Black Rat. The latter 2 due to the cover of Torment, not so much the title. Its purely a coincidence. There is no thematic or other connection to the previously mentioned Japanese ones.

Torment was like The Strangers but much more twisted,twisted in a good way of course.

It has a great veteran horror cast such as Katharine Isabelle and Stephen McHattie.

A newly wedded couple Sara and Cory  move to their house in the country along with Cory's son from a previous marriage,Liam. Liam has 4 large homemade stuffed dolls a Bunny a Monkey a Cat and Mr mouse these dolls will play apart in the plot early on.

Unbeknownst to the Sara,Cory and Liam there is a family of cult members living in the house and they have some twisted things in store for this newly formed family. Its creepy and very tense at times.

Sure there's nothing new in the plot, and the victims do stupid things, but that's a staple of this genre.  Torment was entertaining from start to the end. Basically a newly wed couple and the spoilt brat from the dad's first marriage have moved into the dad's former home.  The brat whose biological mother died years ago, treats his dad's new hot young wife (Katherine Isabelle) like a piece of dirt even though she's done nothing wrong towards him. Surely the brat should appreciate what a feat is was for his dad to score someone younger and way out of his league, and if he wrecks that, his dad's not likely to ever forget that every time he goes to bed alone. You should never be hoping the kid character in a film dies, but you sort of are with this one.

8648107,2,B00J4LMLSA,"Well, i've seen this before, only done better.
The kid, Liam, almost made me turn this movie off, his attitude, his voice, everything made me angry. For some reason the writers decided to write him as all upset about getting a new mom, which is fine! i understand that, but they treated it like she was just plopped in the car for the road trip to the cabin. I understand kids not being okay with a new mom, but it just seemed like she came out of the blue, from how the kid was treating her. Speaking of the new mom, she's played by Katharine Isabelle, so at least the movie had that going for it. You immediately meet this kid, liam's stuffed animals, which play a pretty big part. The script needed work, i know whenever i'm running in the forest from certain doom and murderers chasing me, i take a break to talk about liam, because that's important, to stop running and talk about things that could be talked about later. Honestly with some things they stopped running to talk about made me almost wish they just recited their grocery lists, this is how stupid the dialogue was at some points.
The whole reveal and twist was kind of interesting, but not enough for me to justify changing my rating. Be prepared to hear a lot of yelling out the names ""LIAM! CORY!"".

8648110,4,B00J4LMLSA,"This is a nicely done home invasion psychological torment type of horror film. It deals with the brutality of a sadistic family invading the wholesome life of another family. I've always been a fan of these type of movies. Home invasion is a scary thought. It's a scary idea because they invade your peaceful area. They invade the spot that supposed to be safe, your home is supposed to be your protection, your shield. Your home is supposed to keep your family safe and calm. What happens when a group of individuals decide to break in? Not just to kill you, but to torment you. Not just too quickly savagely brutalize you, but to play with you. To sadistically entertain themselves.

This is a film that I actually enjoyed. I am a huge fan as I have said of home invasion horror films and this one plays out like that. Masked killers, maniacs, sadistic individuals wanting to get their kicks off by haunting and torturing others.

This is directed by Actor | Producer | Director Jordan Barker. I actually think Barker has got a visionary talent in capturing the story on screen as it unfolds for the viewer. I became a fan of Barker after seeing his movie The Marsh. I think The Marsh is a very underrated horror film.

I think Torment had a great quick story. A great premise and a great psychological horror reality that dug deep into the heart of the tension of fear and I think that's what Torment does. I think that Barker has a way with his movies that end up shinning in a fear induced reality.

This Canadian horror thriller to me in my opinion, leaves a lasting impression.

I think the best way to describe this film is very quick, very sound, very dark, very mysterious, and sadistic which all weaves around a very short film.

It being short is also its plus, because it all unfolds rather fast and very vivid.
