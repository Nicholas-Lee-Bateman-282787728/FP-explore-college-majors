For me, the content is extroardinary. He starts with an unbroke horse and teaches his Round Pen technique. Then he covers riding the unbroke horse for the first time and many problems that may arise. He also covers leg cues, teaching leads, obstacles, control, attitudes, as well as many pointers for the more finished horse. I furiously took notes and feel much more confident in my ""horse knowledge"".  These tapes are for all horse enthusiasts. The depth of these videos would greatly benefit both green and seasoned riders and also other horse trainers.",1167782400,2,701,4.890756302521009
