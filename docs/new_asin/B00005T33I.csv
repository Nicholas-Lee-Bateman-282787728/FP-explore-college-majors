7953488,5,B00005T33I,"I bought this tape and the elastic bands. I found that I got a better workout substituting a couple of hand weights for the elastic and did not have to worry about the elastic breaking. The music and the video is a little cheesy, but it is a nice workout to fit in a busy schedule. It does focus entirely on the upper body, primarily the arms, so it is not going to tone your waist. I recommend alternating this workout with others that work the lower body as well.",1136419200,,465,4.177777777777778
7953489,5,B00005T33I,"What a surprise this tape is.  Probably the most enjoyable and fun workout I've ever seen.  And I've seen just about all of them.  Primarily upper body toning and strengthening, and you can adjust the amount of resistance as you get stronger - a real plus. This video gets special kudos for injecting a spirit and sense of humor that is totally lacking in most other videos.  It makes it watchable over and over, something I have a hard time with many other workouts.  The exercises fit the music perfectly.  Richard, you've struck gold! I haven't seen a better match of music and exercise and I've seen hundreds of tapes over the years. Please, we need more like these!",1102464000,3,670,4.588235294117647
7953490,3,B00005T33I,"I did find this video very cheesy, the fake smiles the dancing but I tried it anyway. I'm not out of shape by any means and I was dripping when I got done. It doesn't really work your muscles it's more of a cardio to get your heart pumping and it does! I just really can't stand Richard Simmons though, but I will use the tape when I need a quick thorough workout. Try it who knows you might like it everyone is different!",1030147200,,422,4.035714285714286
7953491,2,B00005T33I,"Many people have said they think the Richard Simmons tapes are too quick and too hard to follow. I have found this true of Broadway Sweat. I like Broadway music and thought this would be a good place to vary my workout. But the tape is CHEESY. The action takes place on a theatre stage with some very colorful characters. Again plenty of stiff and goofy smiling dancers sashay their way to ""Can We Dance?"" from The King and I, ""June is Busting Out All Over"" and other assorted (and lesser known) Broadway songs. I found the steps VERY hard to keep up with. It is more of a dance tape than a work out. I don't like the Tone Up tape at all (I got them as a package set). Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1028246400,3,707,4.093525179856115
7953492,2,B00005T33I,"The TONE UP ON BROADWAY videotape suggests it is A Complete Toning.  Well, it isn't complete toning.  Complete implies total body and this only tones the arms.
Apparently it was shot in 2000, Richard Simmons seems to have lost 20 pounds after the workout, because the cover of the tape is quite different!  Not only does he look like he lost 20 pounds, he turned back the clock 20 years!
The setting is Broadway, dark, theatrical, and black clothes.  The workout is to be done with a CORD that stretches, but it certainly cannot give you much of a workout!
It is a short video, with no aerobics, and no workout!  Skip it! .....MzRizz",1017446400,5,633,4.517543859649122
