8511001,1,B0076LAI5I,Why Woody Harrelson (or the producers/directors) made this I doubt even he knows. Terrible movie and a waste of the 3D techniques.,1393372800,2,130,4.954545454545454
8511002,1,B0076LAI5I,"This film is actually 2007's ""THE GRAND"" (see the IMDB website)!! Such a bad film, I guess that's why they re-named it LOSER... because it is!!!! It was like watching a reality show with the subjects being poker players. I guess if you watch the poker tournaments on TV, then this film is for you? Otherwise, I didn't find the film funny. It couldn't even be saved by 3D... if you want to call it that?!
As once again, this is another 2D film with an ATTEMPT to process it (or convert) into 3D... it failed! The 3D falls flat... just like the film itself!!!
Save your money!!",1342656000,12,575,4.333333333333333
