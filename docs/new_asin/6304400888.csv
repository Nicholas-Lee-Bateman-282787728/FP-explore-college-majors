860870,4,6304400888,"If you have an all-region DVD player, this is available on DVD from Amazon's UK site.

Just go to the bottom of the page and click on ""United Kingdom"", then search for product code B0000CAPWE.

It is on the DVD as half of a double feature, ""Spookable Fun & Boo To You Too"".

If you don't have an all-region DVD player, get one. They do not cost any more than a regular player anymore. There are lots of good things being published in the UK that are not available here in the U.S.
