195801,2,157523730X,"Ok, being that this was filmed in my hometown, I had to rent it.  With that out of the way, it's kinda like a traffic accident, you know you should not slow down to take a look, but something inside you makes you  want to look, such is Uncle Sam.  Being a B-Movie buff, I've seen bad, and  this is BAD with a capital B.  If you're looking for great acting, lot's of  horror and great gore effects, you'd be better off renting ""Sorrority  Babes at the Slime Ball Bowl-A-Rama"" (which I DO recommend).  This  movie is a great plot gone wrong. It's not scary, the gore is terrible, and  the acting is right out of your fourth grade Christmas play.  In fact it  takes 45 minutes before the gore even starts. I'm sorry but if I rent a  horror movie,I like things to get a little bloody before I'm ready to pop  in ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"". But!!!! There is one  redeeming quality about this movie, if you and a group of friends are bored  on a Friday night and you want to watch a horror movie and add a little  dialog of your own, then this is the movie for you, because this movie  screams for audience intervention! Believe me, I wanted this movie to be a  B-movie bonanza, but sadly it's a B-movie BOMB!.  The movie box reads  ""Uncle Sam Wants You.....Dead..."" It should read ""Uncle Sam  Wants You and Your Video Rental Money!""  Take Care! Haunted Mansion",914544000,,1362,4.317460317460317

195807,3,157523730X,"Somewhere in Kuwait during the Gulf War, a military unit uncovers and inspects an American helicopter that was accidentally shot down as a result of friendly fire. During the inspection, they find Master Sergeant Sam Harper's extra crispy, burnt, dying body, who springs to life and during his last breaths, kills a sergeant and major out of revenge before dying.

Weeks later, days before July 4th weekend, Sam's body is shipped back to the US to his family's home in Twin Rivers, New Jersey. His wife, Louise receives the casket containing his remains but upon discovering there's new room in her house for it, allows his sister, Sally to keep it who lives with her patriotic son, Jody. In addition to being pro-American, he also looked up to Sam as a role model, not knowing that Sam was a degenerative alcoholic who abused his wife and sister. And Jody absolutely hates it when anyone says anything negative about Sam, America, or war.

At midnight on July 4th, some degenerative teens are creeping around the graveyard, find an American flag and light it on fire. Some of the flames from the fire touch on Sam's empty grave, triggering Sam's corpse from within the casket to resurrect. Sam moves through the night and first kills some teenage kid in an Uncle Sam outfit and takes the outfit before.

The following afternoon on Independence Day at the town's local 4th of July picnic, Sam goes on a killing spree, killing anyone that crosses his path or who he sees as unpatriotic. With the body count quickly rising, young Jody learns the truth about who his uncle Sam (no pun intended) really was and his views of him change immediately. Because Jody has some sort of weird trance over Sam, he's aided by Sam's former commander, Jed to put down the sadistic, zombified Uncle Sam

Overall: There have been horror movies made about Christmas, Halloween, Thanksgiving, New Years Eve, and now...Independence Day. I'd been wanting to see Uncle Sam to see what it was like so I gave it a watch this 4th of July. It's an okay film but it's not horribly bad. I suppose some better plotting could've gone into the movie. You're telling me that a man's only purpose--who fried to death over accidental gunfire in the war; for coming back to life is to kill off some people in a small town that you feel don't appreciate the country?? I don't buy it. Perhaps the biggest plot hole of all that I want answered in this movie is why there kids are in school in July? Aren't schools out for the summer in July? And you can't possibly tell me that all those kids in there are part of summer school class. Also the first half of the film is spent with I'll give this film props for making the Uncle Sam villain in this look like a creep both masked and unmasked. I'm not sure if the director meant for this film to be serious or not because if he did, it turned out to be extremely comical as I highly doubt anyone that's ever watched this movie and will ever watch this movie, will take it seriously. Somehow despite the bunch load of flaws contained in this movie, I still found myself enjoying it to an extent. I'm not sure if it's because I have a knack for bad-good horror films or if I just love old school horror movies no matter how bad they are. Overall, I guess you could give this a watch to see if it fits your standards. If you want to give this a watch, I recommend renting this from Amazon first to see if it'll meet your expectations and go from there. I guess I've found my yearly Independence Day horror movie to watch",1435968000,2,3525,4.485981308411215
195808,2,157523730X,"Its a pretty familiar refrain from me, but I wish Larry Cohen had directed Uncle Sam instead of simply writing it. There is a very subversive film to be made from his script that undercuts the faux-patriotism of blindly following your countrys government, no matter how morally questionable its actions. Cohens script also tries to graft on a critique of how the military might appeal to angry, violent young men and how the military sees them as useful assets in times of war. Both issues make for intriguing subtexts, but it seems like one too many elements for director William Lustig to wrangle into a coherent whole.

The rest of my review is on my site: http://obsessivemovienerd.com/2014/05/12/the-cohen-case-files-uncle-sam-1996/",1430611200,,737,5.299145299145299
195809,3,157523730X,"Disappointingly violent but nonetheless creative film from the celluloid-engulfed pen of Larry Cohen tells the pointed but not entirely serious story of a combat soldier returned home in a coffin--but old Sam may not be ready to take that final plunge into the stomach of the Earth, leading to much confusion, much madness, and much murder (some killings of which are not entirely unjustified here, considering the story's content).
Actual veterans may be slightly offended by it, and others may think that the film is simply too low in scale for their tastes, but essentially this is both a dark and funny movie (with a few gory after-kills and some brief female nudity thrown in) that could only have been dreamed up by the minds of both Cohen and director William Lustig. But I do agree with others that, on the whole, the film is disappointing. I have to confess that Lustig's ""Maniac"" was simply too anti-story for my taste, and while Cohen's script is more interested in narrative possibilities (a speech made by the Isaac Hayes character near the beginning is quite poignant really), this time there is simply a falling out of potential as the storyline progresses, as the movie continues to degenerate into a kind of slasher-movie-cum-revenge-story that is toying with the possibility of losing audience sympathy by the time it reaches its (rather predictable) conclusion. Larry Cohen may actually be weakening as a film writer, but he is far better than most mainstream screenwriters, even when he is at his most aloof--or rushed.
Again, though, what makes the disc a keeper for me (and almost made me consider boosting the star count up to four) is the wonderful audio commentary track, which features Lustig, Cohen, and a couple of other guys who worked on the movie. They talk and talk (and at one point Cohen even does a swell impression of Humphrey Bogart--catch Cohen's intros to the TRAILERS FROM HELL series if you haven't already done so) and give many, many insights into the movie business and what it's like to produce a low-budget, cost-effective genre picture these days (as you may have predicted troops, the results ain't pretty, but at least there is a light of hope for aspiring and committed moviemakers who are serious about learning the requirements of these markets). Anyway, it is a great audio commentary recording for a movie that probably didn't deserve one this good.
Also, Blue Underground's treatment is typically immaculate and stylized, offering great insert artwork and DVD cover art, terrific trailer galleries, and a very nice widescreen picture and digital sound transfer. It's very difficult to complain about their work, even though ""Uncle Sam"" was not the hidden gem that I was hoping it would be. C-",1422057600,,2747,4.973913043478261

I had high expectations for this film, but I was a little disappointed.  Where I was expecting scares and fright, I only got the occasional good zombie make-up and some pretty good acting...considering the plot was weak overall.  There wasn't much motivation for the villain and the victims weren't really all that personal to the killer.  But, the saving graces for the movie were Isaac Hayes and P.J. Soles.  Isaac stole the show and I don't regret purchasing it.  It's a great flick for the 4th of July and to get drunk by!  The ending by far was the best part of the movie.

Contrary to some reviews, the acting is quite good (especially for a straight to video movie). This movie also has several sub-plots which is a rarity for horror.
The movie starts off a bit slow but quickly picks up the pace. There are some entertaining and creative ways Uncle Sam kills his victims. I won't spoil the movie and tell you, but you won't be disappointed.
All in all an excellent flick and I would definitely recommend it for your DVD collection.
I purchased a used copy on DVD and the movie looked and ran like it was brand new.

Get some popcorn and turn out the lights.....this movie will definitely become a classic in due time.",1254096000,,836,4.428571428571429
195825,5,157523730X,"Back in 1997, well into Sid's journey through the world of b, we were cruising through the local small town Blockbuster when we cam across an interesting video (that's right, VHS). The holographic cover caught our attention as picture of Uncle Sam turned into a hideous looking zombie by moving it from left to right. This is something right up our alley. We loved it a year prior from the Jack Frost cover and decided we must view this patriotic b horror knowing there would be plenty of laughs to be had. Fast forward 12 years down the line and Sid decided there was no better time then the present to take a second look. Luckily we enjoyed it even more then the first view. Of course it came with a little Thursday additive but still was really enjoyable causing plenty of laughs.

The premise for this one revolves around a Desert Storm vet named Sam. He winds up getting killed during combat and is shipped back home for a proper funeral. His nephew is a dead ringer for Troy from The Final Sacrifice and takes part in plenty of pro-war propaganda, which was just too b. He hangs around his uncle Sam's casket with delusions of granger until July 4th. This is the date Uncle Sam rises from the dead to start tearing up the unpatriotic townspeople. It just fantastic! Sid's favorite part had to be the peeping Tom watching a girl get ready to shower while standing 2 floors high on stilts. Uncle Sam winds up loping his head off and stealing his costume which actually looked pretty creepy.

Uncle Sam was an absolute hit for Sid. It brought us back to some great times when life was so much more simple providing us with plenty of glory day banter. Anytime we have the chance to revisit an old favorite we just have to act on it. Anything prior to 2000 is typically the golden age for Sid and will always be revered as the greatest times ever. For the stuffy horror fan this one will probably be a complete waste. If you're looking for legitimate scares then steer clear of this one. However if you're in the market for an evening of brainless horror laughs then this was is a 5 star event. Sid enjoyed this one years ago and loved it even more now.",1253059200,,2154,4.409547738693467

Entertaining and gory if funny horror comedy from director William Lusting ( ""Maniac"", ""Vigilantee"") and writer Larry Cohen (""The Stuff"", ""It's Alive"") combines a witty and gruesome little tale about a bloody 4th of July.

195828,5,157523730X,"A movie that actually has that line in it is already deserving of at least three stars.  Uncle Sam is one entertaining film.  Notice I say ""entertaining"" and not ""scary"".  A few of the one star reviewers apparently expected this to be scary, but all you have to do is merely look at the coverbox of this film, and anyone with common sense knows that this isn't meant to be taken seriously.  Uncle Sam is directed by Blue Underground founder, Bill Lustig.  Lustig directed Maniac Cop, which this film is very similar to.  B movie legend Larry Cohen wrote the script.  Sam was ""killed"" by friendly fire in the Gulf war, and once his body is shipped home, he decides he isn't gonna rest in peace.  Sam is a hardcore patriot(and psychotic and child molester), and blames his ""death"" on Un-American Americans(he indirectly refers to hippies and draft dodgers as ""cowards"").  Once out of the coffin, he dons an Uncle Sam outfit and wreaks havoc at his hometown's annual 4th of July celebration.  His targets include the draft dodging schoolteacher, the cop moving in on his wife, a couple of flag burning punks, a tax cheater, and a guy who makes a mockery of the national anthem.  As ridiculous as this plot sounds, and as easy as it may be to lump this film into the category of silly horror flicks like Leprechaun and Jack Frost, Uncle Sam seems to have a little more class.  Though it's not meant to be taken seriously, it's not trying to be outright comedy like the aforementioned films.  The style is more in the vein of an 80s slasher flick without taking itself as seriously as one.  Bill Lustig knows the genre.  He may not have directed many films, but he's extremely immersed in the horror/exploitation genre.  He's made his own contributions in the early 80s, and of course he runs Blue Underground.  Before the end credits he even has a dedication to Lucio Fulci(this film was made right about the time of his death in 96).  Plus, with Cohen on board as the writer, we have a real dynamite combination.  That's not saying the movie is perfect.  There's a blind, crippled kid who shows up about an hour into the film possessing a psychic ability and a strange bond to Sam which is never fully explained.  All in all this character is completely pointless and does nothing at all for the movie.  Genre fans will be pleased to see Bo Hopkins, PJ Soles and Robert Forster in small roles.  You eventually get a good look at Sam's face in the last ten minutes or so of the film and I must say he does look kinda creepy.  Definitely one you should see.

195832,4,157523730X,"After his helicopter is shot down by ""friendly fire"" in Kuwait, the charred remains of Desert Storm hero Sam Harper (David ""Shark"" Frahlich) are recovered by a reconnaissance team and shipped off to his Midwestern hometown back in the States.  His sister Sally (Leslie Neale) and his widow Louise (Anne Tremko) are actually relieved to learn that the abusive Sam is dead, because in life he was a fanatical right-winger whose legendary heroics actually stemmed from his propensity for being domineering and downright sadistic.  In fact, the only person in town who seems to mourn Sam's demise is his nephew, Jody (Christopher Ogden), who has long worshipped his uncle as the epitome of bravery and manhood.
Sam's burned and apparently mummified body arrives home in a sealed casket a scant day or two before the 4th of July, and when some of the town's juvenile delinquents perform a disrespectful flag-burning ritual at the fallen war hero's freshly dug grave, not even Death can restrain Sam's patriotic indignation.  Sam rises from his coffin, appropriates an Uncle Sam costume, and celebrates Independence Day by meting out fatal punishments to the town's hoodlums, crooked politicians, draft dodgers, and anybody else he considers to be un-American.  When young Jody discovers who's behind the wave of killings, the lad realizes that his uncle may not be so worthy of admiration after all, and he and a few of his friends set out to thwart the activities of the flag-waving fiend.  But will Jody and his buddies be able to stop Uncle Sam before it's too late?
On the surface, 1997's UNCLE SAM seems to hearken back to the early 1980s and the heyday of the slasher-flick.  Following the basic formula of the popular films from that era--films such as HALLOWEEN (1978) and FRIDAY THE 13th (1980)--UNCLE SAM centers around a mentally unbalanced individual who inexplicably rises from the grave to become a serial-killing juggernaut, and only a few innocents are able to learn the killer's identity and ultimately halt his murderous spree.  The unique variation in this film is that, instead of eliminating promiscuous teens (the typical slasher-flick victims), the unctuous Uncle Sam is picking off anybody who pooh-poohs old glory, hot dogs, baseball, apple pie, or any other icon of the American way of life.
But if viewed as straight horror, UNCLE SAM will read as a rather goofy film.  There is actually much more going on here than just a bunch of gratuitous bloodletting.  Scripted by indie auteur Larry Cohen--well known for penning and directing way-above-average exploitation genre flicks such as IT'S ALIVE! (1974), GOD TOLD ME TO (1976), and Q: THE WINGED SERPENT (1982)--and directed by Cohen's sometimes-collaborator William Lustig (1988's MANIAC COP and sequels), UNCLE SAM is actually a dark Juvenalian satire of cultural phenomena like blind patriotism, patriotic demagoguery, the romanticizing of war, and misguided hero worship.  Although the satirical aspects are more blatant here than in THE STUFF (1985)--Cohen's top-notch feature-length mockery of consumer excess and the smarmy advertising industry that spurs it on--UNCLE SAM still cogently and humorously delivers its message and is therefore a lot of fun to watch.  It has also been argued that UNCLE SAM is gently spoofing the slasher sub-genre itself.  While it's obvious that this is not the primary theme, it would be difficult to deny that the film does offer a few playful jabs at other holiday-themed slasher flicks.
The acting in the film is above par, especially for a low-budget horror film.  (Watch for lots of well-known faces, including Timothy Bottoms, Isaac Hayes, and the cute P.J. Soles of HALLOWEEN fame.)  The cinematography is excellent, the attention to color (especially the reds, whites, and blues), the use of shadows and contrast, and the skillful framing in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio at times breathtakingly beautiful.  And Lustig's direction is tight but not overbearing, and he keeps the plot moving along at a natural but exciting pace.
In many ways, UNCLE SAM is a family-friendly slasher flick.  That's not to say that it's suitable viewing for the pre-teen Disney crowd, but the characteristics typical of the genre have been toned down.  Some of the killings carried out by the titular character actually take place offscreen and are therefore merely implied, and even the murders that do occur within the camera frame are not nearly as bloody nor as gruesome as the genre norm.  And unlike many horror films of recent decades, the T&A factor is practically non-existent, with only one scene offering a very brief flash of female nudity.  For a genre-loving family with children aged 13 or older, screening this film as part of the 4th-of-July celebration could become a fun annual tradition.
The new DVD treatment of UNCLE SAM from Blue Underground is superb.  The digital transfer is nearly perfect, with nary a discernable filmic or digital artifact.  The sound quality is also wonderful, with viewers given two versions of Dolby from which to choose.  And there is lots of cool bonus material, too, including two feature commentaries, the original theatrical trailer, and more.
UNCLE SAM may not be to every viewers taste, but most genre fans who enjoy dark satire will want to give the disc a spin.  And fans of Larry Cohen will certainly want to add this one to their DVD collections.",1088985600,16,5398,5.081447963800905
195833,5,157523730X,"this is one of my new favorite horror flicks!! its more of a SLASHER flick than a ZOMBIE flick(the slasher is the zombie) this movie is a breath of fresh air in my opinion!!! it plays like a ""HALLOWEEN"" ""FRIDAY the 13th"" or a ""NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET"" on the 4th of july but then it has its own unique creative bite to it, wich makes it just as good if not better than those masterpieces!!! in the 80s this flick would have been a box office smash instead of going straight to video!! if some big name like WES CRAVEN was involved it would have been a hit!?!? ""UNCLE SAM"" makes ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER"" look like a freakin walk in the park!!! much better in so many different ways!!!! way scarier/more creative directing/better make up & special effects/acting isn't so bad. the only thing about the movie that rubbed me the wrong way was the stupid kid in the wheel chair!!! the movie could have done without him!!! they could have come up with a much better way for the kid to find out who his uncle was & you all will understand what i mean when you watch it for your self!!! anyway it doesn't ruin the movie by no means! so hurry up & get this refreshing new slasher/zombie classic!! done up 80s style!!!!!

It's not a war-mongers movie, nor a pacifists, either.  Just don't mess with the flag when crazy Uncle Sam's around.

195837,5,157523730X,"Sam Harper went to the Persian Gulf War with a wife in the States and a belly full of hate. His chopper crashed in the desert, a victim of friendly fire, and it took three years to find his body. Now Harper is back home in a metal coffin with a wife who no longer wants to remember him and a nephew who thinks his uncle's sacrifice is the height of honor. Sam's hatred of those who besmirch American values is enough to bring him back to life, and now his hometown of Twin Falls is about to pay a heavy price when this soldier awakens to settle some scores. During the course of Harper's bloody rampage, his nephew Jody learns that a love of death is a poor substitute for love of one's country. Everything reaches a head at the July 4th celebration when bodies start to fall like rain. This is the fundamental plot of William Lustig's bloody 1997 horror film ""Uncle Sam."" Starring a cast of notables including Bo Hopkins, Isaac Hayes, Robert Forster, and Timothy Bottoms, Lustig's homage to misguided patriotism delivers on several levels while failing on several more.
One thing that works here is the gore, with a nasty looking broken leg, an impalement with an American flag, TWO guys on fire, a beheading, and a hatchet in the head. I also liked the look of Sam Harper as a desiccated zombie who dispatches anyone he considers unpatriotic. Although we don't see Harper for most of the movie because he's dressed in a cheesy Uncle Sam outfit, look for the scene where a dead Harper pins medals on his bare chest. The sound effects in this scene and when Sam walks are unsettling, as he squelches and crackles with every step. I think most gorehounds will like a lot of what they see in terms of special effects in this movie. Throw in Isaac Hayes as a one-legged aging war veteran who feels guilty about glorifying war, Timothy Bottoms as a draft-dodging teacher, and Bo Hopkins as a sleazy Army sergeant and you have B movie gold.
Unfortunately, ""Uncle Sam"" founders with laughable dialogue and plot holes you could sail the British Navy through. I should vacillate here and mention that a pathetic and fragmented script may go either way. If you don't like to laugh at movies unless they are comedies, then the failings of Lustig's film will bother you. However, if you are like me and occasionally find cheesy dialogue funny, ""Uncle Sam"" may fit the bill. I laughed repeatedly as this movie lurched and shuddered to its conclusion. Allow me to make a few comments on some of the more implausible scenes and interactions in this movie. I will only mention a few, but anyone with a sharp eye could easily list more:
How does Sam Harper get out of his casket? I understand that Jody undid one of the latches the first time he messed with it, but later we see two latches when Jody and Jed Crawley check to see if Harper is still in his coffin. Besides, Sergeant Twining told us in the beginning of the film that the coffin is 'sealed.' Doesn't this mean there are more than a couple of easily turned latches keeping the casket closed?
I have never, ever, witnessed a gunnysack race where the sacks cover the entire person's body. As if that is not enough, the racecourse goes through the woods where roots, huge fallen logs, and steep hills challenge the contestants. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't think of jumping through a forest in a gunnysack, let alone allow my kids to do so. But they are doing it here, and you can hear people grunting and yelling in pain when they fall down. This scene is so ridiculous you cannot help but laugh at it.
What's up with Barry? Is he Strangelove's kid? Barry appears late in the film; a blind, wheelchair bound youth permanently scarred in a fireworks accident the previous year. Apparently, Barry is psychic, as he always knows what's going to happen with Sam Harper before anyone else does. Not only that, but Crawley and Jody haul him along when they return to the house where Harper's casket lies. Why take a kid in a wheelchair into a potentially life threatening situation? Incredibly, they always leave Barry sitting outside alone when they run around the house or go to fetch a weapon to use against Sam. Barry's in a wheelchair, for goodness sake! How will he defend himself if confronted by Uncle Sam? The capper occurs when Crawley positions himself outside the house with a cannon (!) waiting for Jody to lure Sam outside. Crawley growls ""I can't fire with that kid in the way,"" and Barry replies, ""Go ahead and fire. He'll get out of the way!"" WHAT? How do you know that, Barry? Oh, I forgot. He's psychic. Barry may well be one of the creepiest characters in film history.
I could go on forever with the bloopers and blunders in nearly every scene of this movie. I'm being a little harsh, but overall I really liked ""Uncle Sam."" I can't help it; this movie is just too funny to hate. I watched the ""Special Edition"" widescreen DVD version, which includes a trailer and a commentary with Isaac Hayes and William Lustig. I listened to a good portion of this commentary, and Bill Lustig is almost childlike with joy over ""Uncle Sam."" His enthusiasm for filmmaking is infectious. Give ""Uncle Sam"" a chance; it's great, cheesy fun.",1059004800,2,5192,4.559957173447537

The movie starts well but soon desends into snorsville. It takes a long half hour defore something finally happens, some of the deaths are quite good and some are quite dull.

Some great moments to watch for:

 - The *blind* kid telling Isaac Hayes'  character where to fire the cannon

The director is deciding to push the idea, with absolutely zero subtlety whatsoever, that the only injustice of the first Gulf War is that a few Americans just so happened to die by American hands. That's what made the war a problem. That was what the liberals of the time were upset about. No mention of the falsified testimony in front of congress that led to the first Gulf War, no mention of the fact that Saddam Hussein had been an extremely useful instrument of American foreign policy until the powers-that-be decided he wasn't.

No, it's this trivial minutiae that warrants a film.

This movie tries to hold American symbolism up against America, and the result is an absolutely despicable attempt at parody.
