6994296,1,B00SXFIHIG,"I love this series and have seen various episodes of Season Three on the local PBS station. However, I am giving Series Three Part One only one star because there are only 8 episodes (not the full 15 episodes) in this collection. Moreover, the price is considerably higher than the Season One and Season Two collections, which contained 10 episodes each. I placed an order for Series Three Part One, but will cancel that order now that I understand that it does not contain all of the episodes and the price seems unfair.",1453766400,44,521,4.612903225806452
6994297,1,B00SXFIHIG,"I am only posting a negative review for how they are now selling this series. Obviously I haven't seen this season as it has not been released yet. I have purchased and viewed the first two seasons. The are fantastic and excellent. Couldn't wait for season 3 but I will not spend my money on an already overpriced product, for just a partial season. Part One. Seriously ?? .. What a HUGE rip-off. $35.00 for a partial season. No Way. Imagine if no one purchased this and they were forced to reconsider their marketing values. Father Brown is an excellent person, excellent show, excellent writing, directing, acting, ....it is just EXCELLENT. So let's rip-off the people with a partial season and over price the product.",1452384000,18,720,4.768

6994299,5,B00SXFIHIG,Maintains the same high production standards as the first two seasons... well done!,1434672000,,83,5.461538461538462
6994300,4,B00SXFIHIG,"Just finished watching the set.  Again the story lines were great with humor and mystery.
All the actors are great, but after Father Brown, Mrs. M. is my favorite.
Now the question is there a Part Two for Season Three.",1433808000,17,218,4.45
6994301,5,B00SXFIHIG,"It's the late 1950's. The Cold War is in full swing, and in this season it even makes itself felt in sleepy Kembleford, Father Brown's village. What the Season 3.1 episodes show is that oddness and murder find their way to Father Brown no matter where he is.

""A Good Man. An Even Better Detective""

At first viewing, I got the impression that there was less humor in series 3.1, compared to prior series. But I think that's because there are some different themes at work this year. On second viewing, I realized there is still a lot of humor, it's just that there's some heavier stuff going on, too. Mrs. McCarthy has never been my favorite character. She tends to be gossipy and parochial. In this series her judgmental side isn't pretty, but it also adds drama. Lady Felicia has more screen time this season, in both comedy and drama, and her character has become more two-dimensional. Overall, a very satisfying series.

In any case, the new Father Brown mystery series are cozies with an amateur sleuth. PG and definitely not police procedurals.

""Father Brown"" Series 3 originally aired in January 2015 with a total of 15 episodes. The 3.1 set has the first 8 of those episodes. The 8 episodes total 356 minutes of mysteries.

The 3.1 DVD set presents the episodes in 16:9 anamorphic and 5.1 Dolby Digital. English subtitles are available. There is no DVD bonus content.

1. ""The Man in the Shadows"" Sid Carter, Lady Felicia's chauffeur and Father Brown's friend, is going fishing when he sees a masked man trussing up a body in rope and stones, ready to toss it into the nearby river. The killer gives chase and Sid gets away by the skin of his teeth. The police recover the body before it can be thrown into the river. Then some curious things happen. The newspaper reports that the man drowned, the police warn Sid off for asking questions and the masked man makes another try at Sid. All of which make Father Brown twitch with curiosity.
2. ""The Curse of Amenhotep"" Prologue: 1928 Egypt and Sir Raleigh Beresford discovers the sarcophagus of Amenhotep. His wife reads the inscription on its cover: ""He who disturbs the appointed of the Gods, shall suffer their wroth."" After which a cave-in kills Sir Raleigh's wife.
Back to the 1950's and Beresford's curator is giving Father Brown, Lady Felicia and Mrs. McCarthy a tea-time tour of the Lord's Egyptian collection. This doesn't include Amenhotep's sarcophagus, because it's been unopened and in storage for 26 years after the death of his lady. Unexpectedly, the bellowing Lord turns up in the middle of the tour, introducing his new wife of two weeks, the vivacious Caterina. Beresford decides to open the sarcophagus. Will he unleash the Egyptian curse a second time?
3. ""The Invisible Man"" Once a year, the circus comes to town. Father Brown is enjoying it, and when he sees Nicholas and Laura, he reminds them of their 2nd pre-marriage counseling session the next day. Then follows an odd encounter. The clown, Mr. Smythe, reminds Laura that she promised to marry him the last time they were in town. And ""The Wonderous Welkin"", a hypnotist, also thinks Laura promised herself to him. What Laura thought was a joke was deadly serious to the circus performers. Deadly, as in to the death.
4. ""The Sign of the Broken Sword""  A new memorial is being dedicated to the Kembleford men of the 3rd Army who died at Dunkirk. Father Brown is on hand for the luncheon held on the army base. He admires the broken sword on display. It belonged to Colonel Sinclair: ""When he ran out of bullets, he used his sword. It broke on German bones."" There is something off about the story of Sinclair's bravery, and the very drunken Major David Rawlings threatens to be the one to speak it. If someone doesn't get to him first.
5. ""The Last Man"" It's cricket! The cricket pitch has a clubhouse with the sign ""Hamblesten CC"" over it. As the team practicing is the Kembleford team, Father Brown asks his dear friend, Professor Jane Milton, why the different name. Jane explains, ""These acres were once the site of a boundary dispute between Lord Hemblesten and Lord Montague.""
Felicia continues, ""Generations of in-fighting got quite tedious. So they reached a gentlemen's agreement. An annual cricket match. The winning side claiming ownership for the following year."" Unfortunately, there is some small print in the binding agreement. Any side that wins 10 annual matches in a row, gets the land permanently, and Hamblesten has already won 9 times in a row. But is a cricket pitch something to kill for?
This is a great episode, and the ending is pure Father Brown, all heart and faith.
6. ""The Upcott Fraternity"" Father Brown arrives at the Upcott Seminary, his alma mater, to take the confessions of the seminarians. First he sees his good friend, the Rector, Father Palfreyman. Father Brown commiserates over the seminary's foray into the news. A recent inquest determined ""death by misadventure"" for seminarian Douglas Kitchen. He drowned on a retreat in Italy. Thomas Potts was on that trip, and something is bothering him. As he tells two other seminarians, ""I've been having these nightmares again. This is reparation. We've stepped away from God."" And then he flings himself from a tower roof to his death. Or does he?
7. ""The Kembleford Boggart"" Father Brown is playing chess with Aggie, a traveller on her annual return to the Kembleford region. They're interrupted by Mrs. McCarthy and Jeremiah Moxley. A chalice has been stolen from the church altar and Jeremiah claims he saw Aggie's son, Alfons, in the churchyard: ""The bearded, brutish fellow. I'll swear on the cross."" But he would, wouldn't he, if he had an ulterior motive.
8. ""The Lair of the Libertines"" It is a hilarious beginning. Lady Felicia, Mrs. McCarthy and Father Brown are squashed into the back seat of a cab. They were at a choir competition and are on their way home, complaining all the way about the cab and its driver. When Lady Felicia says, ""I've got a good mind to get out and walk,"" the driver obliges by dumping them at the side of the road.
""Where are we?"" turns into a hike over the hills until they're overjoyed to see The Cuba Hotel. Food and drink, yes, but the phone is out and all guests arrive by taxi. This means they'll have to stay overnight, which Madame Chania, their hostess, thinks is humorous. She eyes Father Brown: ""It might be fun watching his halo slip."" Oh boy. They've wound up at a weekend reserved for international playboys, with all shapes and sizes of hedonism. More than Mrs. McCarthy can imagine.
This is an off-the-wall, funny and quirky, episode. Except for the murders.

If I were to pick, I think I like Season Two the best, so far, of the Father Brown mysteries. But 3.1 is still a lot of good mystery enjoyment.

If you missed the 1st two series, you missed some good mysteries:

These have some humor, a nice change of the characterization of the ongoing archenemy, and NC and her driver are a hoot.  Getting part 2 of Season 3 this week and Season 4 is preordered.  I hope there will be at least 8 seasons.

6994346,5,B00SXFIHIG,"I must confess that I have always been a fan of this series. It is well written and well acted. For fans of British mysteries, they will instantly recognize this genre. Season Three lacks some of the lighthearted comedy present in the first two seasons, and opts for a grittier, Earthier, and more realistic tone. I miss the lighter repartee of the first two seasons, but I also enjoyed the deeper stories of Season Three.

I love this series but separating seasons into parts isn't necessary.  I don't understand why the cost of this season is so much higher than previous seasons.
