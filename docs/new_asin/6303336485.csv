625561,5,6303336485,"I just watched this movie for a study in my history class, and was completely captivated. I thought it was going to be a boring
school movie, but was amazed to find otherwise. After the film ended, I was heartbroken because I wanted to watch it again. Fortunately, I know that it is available on video so I might purchase it in the near future. RACE TO FREEDOM is a superbly acted, well dramatized historical film that displays the horror
of slavery with great intelligence. This film is well scripted
and well laid out. The ending, though being very fairy-taleish
is extremely happy and when it ended, our class clapped. Hehe, and when Solomon shot the bounty hunter (from 'Cowboys Don't Cry'), our class cheered. An excellent film.",1067472000,39,733,4.734375
625562,5,6303336485,This video is an excellent addition to anyone's library. It follows the journeys of four runaway slaves to the promised land in Canada. The filming is beautiful and the story heartrending and powerful. Shows the difference that human beings can make by helping one another against the odds. I would definitely recommend this movie.,1000944000,25,331,5.148148148148148
625563,4,6303336485,"This is a film demonstrating the frustrating experiences and heroic attempts of abolitionists and fugitive slaves.  It is a great introduction to the subject for younger viewers.  Some scenes are graphic in violence (true to life).  Other sequences are little more than stereotypical vehicles for a storybook happy ending. The cruelty of slavery is minimized, yet the terror of attempted escape is portrayed intensely. The streamlined representation of the Underground Railroad is romantacized and not enough credit is given to the initiative of the runaways themselves.  As a film it is engaging. As a representation of history it needs a clarifying introduction.",998179200,33,664,5.480392156862745
625564,5,6303336485,"This movie explain what it was like in those days and how they plan to escape to freedom.  And what they had to go through in search of freedom.
This movie is sad and also has joy and happiness,when they found freedom.
I have watch this movie and enjoyed it very much and it teaches the youngest today about what slavery was like and how today we should love one another, no matter what colour we are...... One movie to be watched!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",984528000,8,461,4.621951219512195
625595,5,6303336485,THIS ONE OF MY GREAT MOVIES AND THANK YOU,1405036800,,41,3.6666666666666665
625596,5,6303336485,This video effectively demonstrates the horror & ignorance of a time in U.S. History that should never be forgotten. Excellent acting and story line. I would highly recommend this video for any who may want to take a glimpse at the issue of slavery in South and the role that the Underground Railroad and its conductors played in U.S. history.,1403827200,,343,4.733333333333333
625597,5,6303336485,"We use this movie when studying the Civil War. Perfect for grades 5 and up.  No bad language, no nudity, or other such nonsense that most movies have.",1402272000,,150,4.357142857142857
625598,5,6303336485,A must see movie. The movie shows life before the civil rights act. This is a true story. Buy the movie.,1389484800,,104,4.0
625599,5,6303336485,Great movie.  Have used it every year for almost 20 years as a resource for the Underground Railroad unit in SS.  Kids love it!,1386547200,,127,4.25
625600,5,6303336485,Great movie about the under ground railroad.  I would love to know what other movies you have with similar teachings.,1381708800,,117,4.85
625601,5,6303336485,I've used this movie for the past 10 years as an introduction to the Underground Railroad for fifth and sixth graders.  It is such a fabulous teaching tool in that it builds context that we can reference throughout the unit when studying primary sources and other historical fiction works.,1362700800,,289,4.8979591836734695
625602,5,6303336485,"I got this to show a high school American Literature class in another country, and it really captured their attention. It's a very sad but true depiction of the underground railroad and I highly recommend it for any teacher who wants to show and not just tell the story of slavery in America and the people who stood up against it. This gripping story follows 4 runaway slaves on their journey north to freedom and shows the obstacles they met along the way and who survived the journey despite being followed. It's a very well done movie and I've already watched it at least 3 times and still am not tired of seeing it.",1354924800,,620,4.447368421052632
625603,5,6303336485,"I have viewed many documentary films on African American history and culture and only hear about the Underground Railroad in passing. This is a very good educational documentary that details the path and roots that slaves took to reach freedom as well as the role the white abolitionists' played in helping.
This is all new film footage for me and I now understand who the black woman everyone called Moses. There is a lot of good stuff in this DVD and I fully recommend you purchase it. I never know that the final destination was Canada I always thought the salves sort freedom in the Northern States.",1351123200,,603,4.644859813084112
625604,5,6303336485,"I am a retired 5th grade Social Studies teacher with a passion for our American History--good and bad! This film was a ""must see"" every year. The students were hooked from the first action and they loved the reality of the cause, the plot, the cast, and the suspense surrounding the exciting escape to freedom. There are some very memorable lines especially when one runaway tries to ""train"" a member of the underground RR how to be a slave owner regarding never look your slave directly in the eye. Since our class time was 45 minutes, the natural break in the movie at the end of day 1 showing was the pitchfork scene. I'll not say more so as to not ruin the action for you! At that point, the movie was cut off to be completed the next day. You could hear them all the way down the hall because they didn't want it to end!! My students learned so much from this film! Any time you can touch another person through his emotions is a giant step in building a memory. History truly comes alive and makes the viewer appreciate the history of how we were, both black and white. As I taught my students, I impressed upon them the reason we study history...so that we will NOT repeat the mistakes of the past. My original VHS tape is worn out and I am ordering a DVD copy in spite of the fact that I am retired from teaching and won't be using it in the same way.",1334188800,2,1359,4.230769230769231
625605,3,6303336485,The content of the DVD itself was as so many African-Americans.  It is a reminder of the struggle of those before us.  The Dvd arrived in bad conidition.  The cover was cracked and subsequently the Dvd was permanently scratched. It was truly a disappointment.  It caused me not to order from Amazon for a while.,1333843200,,311,4.6
625606,5,6303336485,"i love this dvd, if you love black history, then you will love this dvd...it make  me extemely proud to be a black woman, i love my ancestors...and bless those non black for sacificing their lives for us, they are certainly an angel of god though the blood of jesus.....",1329091200,,270,4.4
625607,5,6303336485,"This movie tells the story of 4 slaves who attempt to escape to freedom on the Underground Railroad.  This movie  represents the horrors of slavery accurately and appropriately without being overly violent. It displays  the incredible  courage necessary for those attempting to escape and the aid given by many different people on the Underground Railroad. It is very school appropriate as it has no bad language.  This movie is very exciting and has several cliffhangers. ""Race for Freedom""  has proved to be an excellent resource for us to use in our Underground Railroad Unit for 4th graders.",1309910400,,595,5.082474226804123
625608,5,6303336485,"THIS FILM I RECOMMEND TO TEACHERS.  I'M 62 YEARS OLD AND THIS FILM TAUGHT ME THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T KNOW PEOPLE FROM THE NORTH CAME TO PLANTATIONS TO ASK SLAVES IF THEY WANTED TO GO NORTH.  AND I WAY THEY WENT NORTH WASN'T THE WAY I THOUGHT IT WAS

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM",1297555200,,285,4.053571428571429
625609,5,6303336485,I have used this film for years in my 8th Grade US History class.  It teaches about the Underground Railroad and slavery in an enjoyable way the students like. They hate for class to end when we are at an exciting part.,1284163200,,219,4.214285714285714
625610,5,6303336485,"I teach adult basic education part time. We have made an extensive study this year of "" The Underground Railroad"". We used this film as a culminating activity. People from other classes were able to join us for the film . The people who did the study over a 6 week period , understood and appreciated the film  greatly -knowing the circumstances and people in the film. It was an excellent learning and review tool. One of the students even bought a copy to be used in his church bible study. I was happy with the purchase and will use it at another time with a different group of students.",1274832000,,590,4.363636363636363
625611,5,6303336485,"I bumped into this movie several years ago as I was trying to find some type of Social Studies related video to show my 4th grade students. I previewed the movie, which is not rated, which at first made me a little nervous, but I was not disappointed with the actors or the development of the storyline. I most appreciated that in this movie it takes you through every aspect of the emotional yet life changing feelings of four runaway slaves fight for freedom. It is the most captivating portrayal of slavery in this country and of the ""Underground Railroad"" for me since seeing ""Roots"" when I was a child. I promised my students that we would watch this life-changing movie, and that is what I plan to do before the last day of school this year. It won't disappoint I promise and it is a great conversational starter. I would recommend this video for parents and 4th or 5th grade teachers. What a powerful way to end the school year or introduce such an emotionally sensitive topic that's apart of our American history!",1273536000,,1021,4.554347826086956
625612,3,6303336485,"A previous reviewer said it was good for class study.  I agree.  This movie gives an elementary introduction to the fugitive slave law of 1850, the Underground Railroad, and the slave catchers hired to return fugitives.  There are some serious problems: mainly the audio is terrible. Considering how bad it is I am stretcheing ti to give three stars to this video.  This problem has been discussed by previous reviewers, and if I had read them before buying it I might have not spent the money.  Eith my fvolume turned as high as possible I still missed half the dialogue.
If you can get this for a couple of dollars it is worth the price.  The story is fair, the quality of the disk is terrible.",1262908800,7,696,4.484126984126984
625613,4,6303336485,"I plan using this video for my African American Literature Course especially for the literary period from 1820-1870.  I hope this will give students an opportuntity to understand the Underground Railroad movement.  The video is informative and creates a good mood for student understanding.  I enjoyed the video immensely, found it to be informative, illustrative of the period and educational.  I would highly recommend this video.",1259280000,,432,5.5
625614,5,6303336485,"If it is just for adults, I would probably rate it a 3.5 but if you're a teacher, it is worth your while.

Teach 8th grade.  Easy to understand.  Horrific enough in the early part of the movie without needing to rate it R.  Little known but the students thoroughly enjoy it and it's better than a documentary.  Low budget but goood acting.",1225411200,,339,4.317460317460317
625635,3,6303336485,"Race to Freedom is worth watching as an introduction to the underground railroad leading up to the Civil War.  Some of the characters intertwined in the story are actual historical figures who played roles in the underground railroad.  The technical quality of the sound on the copy I recieved was not very good, but all in all it is worth watching.",1210204800,2,349,4.704918032786885
625636,4,6303336485,"Until watching this movie, I hadn't given much thought to the fact that whites were very much a part of helping slaves with the Underground Railroad. I liked how the female character had gained favor with her master only to turn around and break camp with her handsome field hand. Both she and the field hand wanted to get married.

Then came the suspense! Oh boy! Once the massah found out his little peach pie of a black girl had jumped ship, he sent the hound dogs after them.

The ending, while not expected, was quite refreshing and uplifting. I gave it four stars instead of five because it could have been a little longer. Nonetheless, this is a Must-see.",1207699200,,662,4.508333333333334
625637,4,6303336485,"I used this movie in my U.S. History class as we were discussing Slavery, the Underground Railroad and the events leading up to the Civil War.  It gives a great depiction of what slaves would go through to get away from the everyday struggle of being a slave.  Very interesting and engaging for students to easily follow along.",1179014400,5,327,4.620689655172414

625639,4,6303336485,"I used this movie in my history classroom to dramatize the reality of what slaves were faced with daily, their courageous spirits and the courage of the people who helped them. I thought the movie did a great job of impacting the students. They liked it very much.",1175126400,,264,4.520833333333333
625640,5,6303336485,The movie has a good story line on the sufferings on some of the unfortunate early settlers in the United States.  It has a good moral on the sympathetic and humane action by some fellow humans that are more fortunate in helping those that are not.  The movie has a good balance between dialogue and action with not too much violence.,1162080000,6,334,4.459016393442623
625641,5,6303336485,"This was a wonderful historically accurate representation of slavery and the operation of the Underground Railroad!  I watched this with my 11 year old son.  It kept us on the edge of our seats.  My son said, ""Mama, I did not know that slaves were treated this badly.""",1156550400,7,268,4.541666666666667
625642,5,6303336485,"An ""edge of your seat"" movie, where you actually feel as if you are fleeing with the characters.  A must have for any DVD Library.",1142121600,2,130,4.2
625643,5,6303336485,The movie took me inside the Underground Railroad and showed how people of all walks of life were involved in assisting African-Americans in helping them cross into Canada.,1074297600,9,172,5.178571428571429
7843613,3,6303336485,"Unfortunately, I had read in a review that this was an okay movie for kids. One review even complained this movie was sugar coated with everything working out nicely, so I had hoped this would be a good movie to share with my children to teach them a bit more about the underground railroad.  We didn't make it very far into the movie, however, until my children were trying to make sense of the beautiful woman that was being...taken advantage of.  There was also a badly beaten man with a swollen face at the very beginning that was just too much for young viewers. We discontinued the movie briefly after the beginning.  I know these were realities and I know this may be a great and powerful movie, but it is not a movie for children as suggested in other reviews.",1496534400,,768,4.432624113475177

7843615,5,6303336485,"A wonderful way to introduce the subjects of slavery and the Underground Railroad to students.  I showed it to my 8th graders yearly.  They were more tuned in because it told a story rather than many ""dry"" historical videos.",1453248000,,224,4.717948717948718
