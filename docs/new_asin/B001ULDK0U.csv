3803051,5,B001ULDK0U,"The most charming collection of children's stories that we have ever seen.  Although I think the target audience is supposed to be for older children, my 2 and 4 year olds love the books and the videos. I do too.",1253664000,3,212,4.3

8344340,5,B001ULDK0U,"These stories are Soooooo sweet- and adults can enjoy them too.  Just the right length to fill in time as needed.  Can watch one or several, and not like needing to watch a whole movie if you are trying to get the kids to bed, etc.",1411084800,,231,4.0
8344341,5,B001ULDK0U,I used to watch these stories with my now-almost-20-year-old! These are the cutest stories that kids and parents can enjoy over and over!,1399766400,,137,5.0
8344342,3,B001ULDK0U,"If you grew up with the stories of Mouse and Mole, you'll enjoy their adventures on DVD.  The Mole is capricious, the Mouse is practical.  Kids will enjoy watching these cute stories.

Even though they are still pictures, the movie is done such that it almost appears as if there is actual movement.  Done very clever this way.

Artwork is great.

8344343,5,B001ULDK0U,"How is it possible for a friendship between two fictional, animated characters to touch a grown woman so deeply? I honestly feel a little silly tearing up watching a children's cartoon. But this is an uncommonly warm and delightful production. As another reviewer said, sweet media breeds sweet children. I don't hesitate to show these animated 5 minute shorts to my 2 1/2 year old. She loves them, as do I. The stories are simple, fun, and beautifully illustrated, with perfect voices and music. The program moves at a slow enough pace to not be jarring to small children, yet keeps their interest. Perfect for the very young and the young at heart!",1376006400,,650,4.761061946902655
8344344,5,B001ULDK0U,My youngest Granddaughter and I watched this on VCR over and over and over again when she was a child.  If we went on a trip we ALWAYS took it with us.  It is a wonderful little story with so many wonderful life lessons.  She is a big girl now preparing for college  and the first time she comes to visit from college I plan for us to watch it together again.  Then I will put it away for her children.,1373155200,,402,3.9135802469135803
8344345,5,B001ULDK0U,"I highly recommend this and the second volume as well. I want to watch this as much if not more than my kids, it's so calming and my husband and I often discuss who is the mouse and who is the mole in our family.",1361664000,,212,3.7333333333333334
8344346,2,B001ULDK0U,"I purchased these Volume 1 & 2 and am not certain that they are really licensed copies. They Quality is OK but they the appear that they were ripped from the video tape at a fairly low scan rate. Thus while I had looked for these a long time I am only partially satisfied. The VHS set was not great, but these appear even worse. I have only watched this on a computer screen and might appear better on a TV Screen which treats the Video a little different than a laptop does.",1277251200,2,475,4.118279569892473
8344347,5,B001ULDK0U,"I love this show!! I am so glad to find it on DVD, couldn't find it anywhere else. Worth the cost to upgrade from my fuzzy VHS, the picture is so clear and the colors so bright! Your kids will loves these cute stories!",1264291200,3,218,3.977272727272727
