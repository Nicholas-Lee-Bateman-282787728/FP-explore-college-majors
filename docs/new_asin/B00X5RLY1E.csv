7158545,4,B00X5RLY1E,"The 80s Who with drummer Kenney Jones is not fondly remembered by most Who fans. I've been a fan since I got Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bouncy from my Dad's collection at age 3 (1973). I listened to it incessantly (no Barney or Blue's Clues back then, I listed to real music!) and every other Who album since then. Face Dances and It's Hard came out when I was about 12, and I saw the Who's ""farewell"" tour on TV in 1982. Since this was the only Who around in my formative tween years, those 2 albums, and the '82 tour, hold a special place in my heart. The only problem is. . . until the CD remixes came out more recently, and until this DVD, the sound of the Who in those years seemed anemic compared to the Who of old. Thin, too processed, and on the generally terrible Who's Last live album, absolutely disgusting. I think a lot of people wrote off the band because they just sounded weak, tinny, brittle, and unengaging. Kenney gets maligned for not being Keith Moon. It's true that his playing with the Who was pretty stiff, which is odd because with the Small Faces and Faces, Kenney was loose, funky, explosive, and one of the most Keith Moon-like drummers out there. By the 80s, he got more metronomic, and his fills were often just on the snare or simple runs across toms from top to bottom (I'm a drummer, I should point out, so I pay attention more than most!). It did not help that he was generally mixed very low, sapping the power of the group.

This DVD, along with the remixed Face Dances and It's Hard, go a long way towards rehabilitating our view of early 80s Who. The Shea Stadium show is energetic, forceful, and, importantly, really full-sounding in this new mix. Pete's guitar growls and keens as it should; Entwistle's bass is not yet the over-processed mess it would be in 1989 and later, and sounds full and clear through those Sunn amps; Kenney's drums are louder and hit harder, and Tim Gorman's keyboards are mixed low, as they should be, giving support without coming to the forefront. Picture quality is good for the time period, if not up to modern standards.

I love the stage set of the huge WHO letters with the group under the ""H"". That in itself became iconic after the '82 Toronto show was put on TV for pay per view. Roger's silver suit is pretty damn cool looking even today, and Entwistle looks sharp in his suit rather than dated as his clothes often were. Pete looks a bit bored in Baba O'Riley, but the rest of the time he's animated and plays fantastically, ripping off some great solos on his Schecter Tele-syle guitars. The mix really brings out his playing, as it should. It's great fun to see Roger play a Fender Esquire during a couple tunes too--most people don't realize he was originally a lead guitarist in the Detours!

One of the best tunes? The criminally underrated ""Cry If You Want"", from It's Hard, an LP that got great reviews when it came out in '82, subsequently fell from fans', and the band's, favor, but is now being re-examined and is considered to be pretty strong by many, including me. ""Cry"" just kicks ass and you can see the glimmer of what The Who could have done next if they'd gotten past this uncertain period and really dug in. Alas, it was not to be.

At least we now have this excellent show preserved with superb sound, to enjoy repeatedly. Any Who fan will be pleased with this release.",1435881600,29,3363,4.4281098546042

7158547,5,B00X5RLY1E,"A most have for Who fans.  Captures the live 82 Who far better then Toronto from this tour.  Who sound man Bob Pridden really mixed the instruments and vocals to sound more like the concerts back then.  This is the rough Who sound fans have wanted:).

7158548,4,B00X5RLY1E,"This was advertised by Amazon to be in widescreen format...i was disappointed that this production did not fill up the entire screen of my HDTV and was not in widescreen format (I hate when any video has those black bars on the screen)...Most concerts I own do fill up the entire screen...Also, one reviewer referred to the ""enthusiastic"" audience...Usually fan reaction doesn't leave much of an impression on me either way but in this video I've never seen such a subdued audience...there was virtually no sound in between tracks and after each song!  This may be a result of the SBD or soundboard recording format...The actual music did sound fine though and I would still recommend this video to anyone who is a fan of The Who, grew up in the seventies or eighties, or is simply curious about The Who's music...a very good sampling of their music and fun onstage interactions between musicians...",1435708800,2,899,4.837662337662338
7158549,5,B00X5RLY1E,"I was at this 2nd night show down by the stage. David johansen went on first, then the clash. Amazing nobody got hurt out front, you could not move, when the crowd moved, you moved. The clash set is out on cd from this show.
I saw the who a lot from '78 on, right after moon died. This show was a real good one, it was the last time they would go out to promote a new album of new material.
Great show, great dvd at a great price.",1435708800,,430,3.7888888888888888
7158550,5,B00X5RLY1E,"To make a long story short, this DVD is a fantastic snapshot of The Who in 1982. The band has more energy, for the most part, here than they did on the Toronto 1982 video release. Only on ""Baba O'Riley"" does Pete look bored. For much of the rest of the show, Pete plays with a vicious conviction. ""Young Man Blues,"" most of ""Long Live Rock,"" part of ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" and some of the then-recent songs find Pete playing with wonderful intensity. Also, Jones sounds fiery at times here, and although there should be more shots of Entwistle (RIP), his bass guitar is prominently featured in the stereo mix. I like how the DVD producers didn't let Tim Gorman's keyboards overpower Pete's guitar. Pete's Schecter Telecasters burn and scream through the mix on Shea compared to Toronto. Several bonus tracks are featured from the first night at Shea (the DVD's main program is Night 2). It's nice to have the bonus songs, but the stage lighting is much more amateurish looking and way too many stage/camera crew members clutter the back and sides of the stage compared to what is seen on the second night.

I'm still a fan of the Toronto 1982 show, even with its flaws. That was the first time (on TV) I had ever seen The Who. But Shea is even better. Sure, Pete's hair is a mess and his clothes are more New Wave than his (better) clothes at Shepperton 1978 and Kilburn 1977, and they should have included ""Athena"" on this DVD, but the sound of the band, for the most part, is spot-on in this new DVD.",1435276800,36,1504,4.449275362318841
7158551,5,B00X5RLY1E,I was as all 3 shows.  Incredible to see that many people there.  Awesome music.  It was the first time I saw  them and been a huge fan ever since going to as many shows as I can both in the U.S. and the U.K.  can't wait to watch the DVD at home.,1435276800,,246,3.5660377358490565
7158552,4,B00X5RLY1E,Great concert.  They really should have called it quits after this tour.  Roger's voice is shot.  Just saw them at the United Center in Chicago.  Not bad but this show makes me happy they recorded it.,1434499200,2,200,4.472222222222222

7158554,5,B00X5RLY1E,"This is a must for fans of The Who early 80s era. Pete Townshend is at his best here on their 1982 tour. Highlights include great versions of ""Naked Eye"", ""Tattoo"", ""Sister Disco"",""5:15"", and many others. The sound mix seems better than the Toronto show most are familiar with. If you love The Who in this era like me you will love this concert!",1453420800,,345,4.40625
7158555,5,B00X5RLY1E,A true Who fans delight . Good to see them perform - so many years ago.,1453161600,,71,3.5
7158556,5,B00X5RLY1E,"This DVD is such a wonderful surprise. I have always loved the Toronto show from 82' (I have it on old VHS and on DVD) - this makes such a nice compliment to it. At Shea they were a little less polished, but Daltry is sounding as powerful as ever (he's a golden God!!), Townshend always projecting soulful emotion and the rest of the band kicking ass...no this is not The Who at their zenith circa 1969-73... but a great document of a band in transition to adulthood. 82' was when I first discovered The Who so this is a special time in their career for me. I found the sound quality and video of this DVD much better than expected. $11 on DVD??? - thats a free ticket and time machine back to Shea Stadium 1982! If you are a Who fan, get this, you won't be disappointed. Don't over think it - just enjoy!",1452211200,3,805,4.166666666666667
7158557,2,B00X5RLY1E,"I like this band or I wouldn't have bought the disc. I just didn't find the performance exciting at all. It is true that many of the songs were performed only on this tour, but there's a reason for that. They weren't good enough to stay in later shows. They billed it as thier retirement tour, and they do seem tired to me.",1452038400,2,323,4.142857142857143
7158558,3,B00X5RLY1E,"Great sound and production values, you couldn't ask for a better version of a video for this show. I just felt the bands performance doesn't warrant anything better than a 3. its kind of lackluster and going thru the motions. Its great hearing them play some songs off their current album of the time, but they are a far cry from their days with Keith Moon. At least this dvd is low priced!",1449100800,,390,4.3561643835616435
7158559,5,B00X5RLY1E,"Everyone always complains that  the Keith Moon era of The Who was the only one that mattered. And though I agree that that version of the original Who was the kick-ass best. I really did dig the Kenney Jones era too. They still wanted to play and record and didn't believe they should end their career because one member of their band decided to party himself to death. Kenney Jones was a great drummer in his own right, with The Small Faces, and The Faces, later on. And  he was a friend of The Who. So get this dvd to experience the 2nd great era of The Who. It does KICK-ASS.",1448582400,3,578,4.198198198198198
7158560,3,B00X5RLY1E,"I was interested in getting this DVD because the Shea concert had one of the better setlists for the Who's 1982 tour, including Athena which was played during a small portion of the tour. I've read that The Who doesn't think much of Athena and doesn't really like playing it live, but it was lame to not even include it as a bonus track as I was looking forward to it.

I've heard a lot of criticism of the Toronto concert, but after viewing this DVD, I much prefer the Toronto concert on DVD. Their Toronto performance is much better, more energetic than credited and they didn't leave out a rarity such as Love Ain't For Keeping. The Toronto concert was clearly intended as a video document, but the Shea concert is wet and dreary with substandard sound and lighting.

Also, although you have to take into account that it was the 80's, Daltrey's Shea outfit was about the worst from that tour. He looks like Ellen Degeneres' twin brother with that silver suit, though I guess we should be happy that he didn't wear the yellow-black stripe ""Sting"" shirt. One other annoyance is the use of camera tricks for the Shea DVD mainly whenever Pete goes into windmill mode. Overall, not a bad performance despite the bootleg quality, but also not the best live Who available on video. The 1982 Toronto and 1981 Rockpalast are the best live documents of that era although the Shea concert has some good moments including ""I'm One/Punk and the Godfather"". Grade:C",1447977600,4,1454,4.631782945736434
7158561,5,B00X5RLY1E,"I was told by a friend not to buy this; the audio was lousy he said. I ignored him and bought it anyhow. Sounds pretty good to me. It was 1982 and it is in a HUGE stadium and it's not recorded straight from the FOH board. It's a bit raw. Well, I like raw. The band sounds great. Roger was close to top of his game back then, Entwistle was...well...Entwistle. Pete (IMO) was playing guitar as well as he ever has during this time period and say what you will but...Kenny Jones is and was a very solid drummer. No, he's not Keith Moon, but he played quite nicely (sorry all you haters). Very good DVD, glad to have it in my collection!",1447632000,,633,4.112903225806452

7158565,5,B00X5RLY1E,"Saw this tour at the LA Coliseum with opening act The Clash.  As The Who had announced this was their farewell tour, it seemed to be a passing of the torch.  The show was excellent, a great night of rock.  When the pay-for-view Toronto show was finally released on DVD, I had high expectations, but both the video and especially the sound quality, were lacking.  This really makes up for it.  An outstanding performance and DVD release.  There are moments (""Drowned"" for example) where the fire and passion of the playing rivals that of 1970's Isle of Wight show.  It's interesting that the two most recent Who albums at the time, It's Hard and Face Dances, while technically top notch, lacked the enthusiasm of earlier Who releases.  Yet on stage these songs really came alive (""It's Hard"", ""Eminence Front"", ""Cry If You Want"", etc.).  Highly recommended!",1444262400,3,856,4.808219178082192

7158567,1,B00X5RLY1E,"First, I have not watched the DVD / Blueray, however I did them on the 82 tour in Boulder. They also played with John Cougar and Jethro Tull. I will say this, Cougar was ok but I did not go to see him. Tull is one of my favorite bands, The Who I had seen back in 71-73 era just after Who's Next came out and they were everything a great rock band should be.. Lastly, this show in 82 was a complete disappointment. It is one that I have chalked up as a none event. I don't know why because as I remember everyone played great, great sound, great seat but when I left the concert I said to myself..so what.",1443398400,,604,3.959016393442623

It's really just a straight forward concert video, but this is pretty much all there is from that era. Minimal credits - no mention of the opening bands, David Johansen and The Clash...this really was a major event when it happened -- well over 50,000 in the stadium and probably twice that outside. The Who's performance was good, but the loss of Keith Moon, which was only 4 years prior, really showed. I feel it's certainly worth getting, for the historical significance, and the fact that it's the only live video I believe of many of the tracks.

7158574,5,B00X5RLY1E,"Wow! This Who Concert is fantastic. I remember when The Who were touring with Kenny Jones as their new drummer but I could not get tickets to this show. But after all these years I am able to see it on DVD. They played a lot of songs including from two of my favorite Who Albums: It' s Hard & Face Dances.

I' ve always liked Kenny Jones as the Who's drummer because he sounds very sharp and distinct. Very focused and his tone is clear. I liked how he handled the mini drum solo of Won' t Get Fooled Again that Keith Moon is famous for. Jones drumed across his kit left and right hitting them right on with ease but solid. Not Keith Moon's version but effective and true to the spirit of the original version.

From the begining of the show Kenny Jones was fearless. Fantastic performance by him on the drums covering the It' s Hard & Face Dances songs along with the Who classics. This is a great show. I will watch it again and again.

Who classics like Substitue, I Can' t Explain, Sister Disco, Drowned are highlights of the show. Oh yes and let's not forget Won' t Get Fooled Again. Newer songs: Emminence Front, Cry If You Want, & The Quiet One are standouts.

I was dissappointed when I saw that Kenny Jones was no longer with The Who after Face Dances. I was looking forward to more recordings from this lineup.",1440720000,5,1320,4.268

7158577,5,B00X5RLY1E,"Seeing a band like The Who in concert is more than experiencing an iconic group in action. Its a moment in musical history. The Who  Live at Shea Stadium 1982 captures one of those moments right on the cusp of a chasm opening up between the members. You might even think this performance had a special intensity to it, giving an edge otherwise missing from their normal shows.

Rough for the folks in the band, but we the audience reap the benefit.

The Who are known for more than just their music. Its their energy, bravado, and rebellion that cemented them in the spotlight all those years ago. While the years may have passed on by, they never pulled back.

During this show you can see lead singer Roger Daltreys microphone twirling skills in full swing (pun intended). He could knock a beer can off an amp at 20 feet. Lead guitarist Pete Townshends hurricane guitar action is also there in all its glory. (P.S. When watching this, picture the fact that years later, Townshend impales his hand on the whammy bar during one of those legendary moments.) The last remaining original member, John Entwistle, otherwise known as Thunderfingers or The Ox, does what he does best, which is stand like a statue while playing the bass faster than most people play guitar.

Seeing those three front and center is a special thing, proving once again internal chaos cannot stop harmony.

The ghost of Keith Moon is surely felt during some of their classic tracks, like Pinball Wizard and Wont Get Fooled Again. While watching the show, you are reminded also about how many of their song intros are woven into your brain, a tightly woven piece of the musical fabric of our time. Baba ORiley, Eminence Front, and the previously mentioned Wont Get Fooled Again were all iconic long before some of them were clipped to the title sequences of the popular CSI TV franchise. Within seconds of each song starting you know the joyful tune about to come crashing in.

Its actually when Eminence Front comes on about eight songs in where I felt the group really begins to hit their stride. Opening up shows can always be tough, and the bigger they are, the more difficult to feel your groove with the audience. But it was that song when the gears all began to slide into place.

Another interesting thing to watch is the balance between Daltrey and Townshend. On stage, the power bounces back and forth between them, and in my opinion Townshends voice is on point more of the show than Daltreys (which Daltrey admits to feeling rough later in the show). But behind the scenes, it really was Townshends creative vision and musical poetry that fueled the group. Maybe that was another part of the reason the band was on the edge of a hiatus right as they plowed through one of their most historic performances.

A crisply captured piece of history, the hair, fashion, and entire flavor of the concert takes you right back to the early 80s. Townshend could easily be mistaken for a groupie for Flock of Seagulls, while Daltrey struts and sweats his way through the entire show in a shiny white power suit. The man is all business.

For longtime fans of The Who (of which I consider myself one, seeing them three times live), The Who  Live at Shea Stadium 1982 is a rare treat. You hear their hits, new materials of the time, and some great reminders of their blues influences. Its a great mixture of musical ingredients coming together inside one of the most legendary bands in rock and roll history.",1440374400,4,3478,4.639024390243902
7158578,5,B00X5RLY1E,"The Shea Stadium shows are probably the most fondly remembered of the band's 1982 farewell tour, and with good reason: they are excellent shows. I mentioned in my review for the closing show in Toronto that the band sounded largely lethargic and uninspired for most of this tour, mainly due to Kenny Jones' drumming becoming increasingly by the numbers and Pete's lack of involvement as well as addiction issues overtaking his ability to sound focused and inspired while playing. Neither factor was an issue at Shea; Kenny is on fire during this show, and Pete plays great throughout the night.

There are many highlights during this great Blu-Ray release of the second night, including an intense ""Eminence Front"" with Pete killing it on the intro, a nice run of ""Quadrophenia"" tracks, the by then very rare ""Tattoo,"" and a killer encore featuring ""Naked Eye,"" ""Young Man Blues,"" and a great cover of ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" among others. The ""It's Hard"" tracks sound great in a live setting here. The sound and picture are both great.

""Live at Shea Stadium"" isn't quite the beast of ""Live at Leeds"" or even ""Live at the Royal Albert Hall,"" but it's a solid, inspired show from an interesting if inconsistent period for the band.",1440374400,,1235,4.820754716981132

Pete is definitely on for the latter half of the show, and as always not nearly enough shots of John. Sound is quite good. And I don't see any of the grainy pics that some are complaining about.

7158594,3,B00X5RLY1E,"This is a decent but not a great live recording.  I don't think The Who were ever less than good live and sometimes they were quite stunning (as they were when I saw the at The Valley in 1974).  For a variety of reasons, this isn't one of their best, but it's well recorded and a good record of the band at this time, if not much more.

There are some great songs on this album, and it's always a pleasure to see The Who perform their classics, but even those are a little lacklustre at times.  As others have noted, Kenney Jones is a great drummer but didn't quite gel with The Who so that magnificent, driving rocket behind them, which Moon provided before his death and Zak Starkey has provided more recently, is missing.  Even the great, great Who songs don't quite blaze as they should.  Also, some of the material from around this time isn't that great in my view, so there are some pretty ordinary passages.

This is certainly no Live At Leeds, and in some ways it's a little sad to see such a great band running into the doldrums slightly.  As a Who fan of 50 years standing I'm glad to have this, but it's not one I'll be playing that often, I suspect.  If you're looking for a really fine Who performance on DVD, I'd recommend Quadrophenia Live In London&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Who-Quadrophenia-Live-In-London-Blu-ray-2014-Region-Free/dp/B00JOWHT2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Who: Quadrophenia - Live In London [Blu-ray] [2014] [Region Free</a>].  Obviously, it's very different: there's no Entwhistle and Townshend and Daltrey are 30 years older, but as a live performance it's superb and miles (and miles and miles) ahead of this.  Only a qualified recommendation from me for this one, I'm afraid.",1436572800,2,1769,5.023972602739726

seven stars!!
eight stars!!!

I threw Live at Leeds in the garbage after I watched this: I'll now give you one common and one iconoclastic reason for doing so.

1. All of the songs that COUNT are HERE (and yeah, ""Cry If You Want"" counts). I don't give a f--- what Lester Bangs would have said, a 'concert' by these guys without Who's Next and Quadrophenia ain't a Who concert.

2. Despite his one-of-a-kind, utterly breathtaking talent, I can't help thinking that Keith viewed music as a device to fund his decadence instead of a way to reach and provide happiness to others. Kenney (and especially Zak) showed a reverence for the music and a respect for the audience that Keith never did.

An alpha and an omega - the first thing to show someone hearing about The Who for the first time, and the final thing that any lifelong fan needs to purchase to make a collection complete.",1436572800,5,890,4.509316770186335
7158596,3,B00X5RLY1E,"I remember this tour fondly. I saw it come through Birmingham Alabama and remember it sounding better than most anything that came through there. Daltrey's vocal on ""Love Reign O'er Me"" echoing in the BJCC may have been the sweetest sound ever heard there. Sadly these recordings do not reflect that. They are largely soundboard recordings and overly cleaned and compressed. It was Shea Stadium and raining. Combine that with their early 80's cleaned up haircuts and shaves and this could never be the Who as we want to remember them. A grown-up Who is what we have. Didn't taste good to them either...that is why this was the last major gasp from them. Still, it's the Who...which means it is solid and I am glad I have it.",1436572800,4,724,4.62015503875969

7158599,5,B00X5RLY1E,"I have fond memories of seeing The Who in Boulder on this tour.  This blu-ray brings it all back.  The set list isn't the same, but that's fine by me.  Not all the songs from ""It's Hard"" have aged that well, and in places, like ""Sister Disco,"" I wish Tim Gorman's keyboards were louder in the mix, but overall the show is great.  As one reviewer pointed out, Townsend looks bored during the first part of ""Baba O'Reilly,"" but by the end he's ripping into it, and he doesn't slow down for the rest of the show.  Stand out cuts include the very rare ""Tatoo,"" a blistering ""Drowned"" with Townsend on lead vocals, and an equally intense ""The Punk and the Godfather.""  The encore includes a rockin' ""Young Man Blues"" and two Beatles cuts.  Pick this one up!",1436227200,8,752,4.405797101449275

However, Pete's playing and the mix so you hear it, is excellent.  The mix is not as good for his guitar in this Toronto.

7158601,4,B00X5RLY1E,"Even though they lost Keith Moon a few years earlier, The Who were at their creative peak in 1982. Within a two-year stretch, Pete Townshend wrote two solo albums and most of two Who albums. It's Hard may not have been their best album, but it has a couple of excellent songs (""Eminence Front"" and ""Dangerous"") which they performed on this over two-hour concert. They weren't resting on their laurels yet. They dusted off ""Tattoo"" and even tried ""A Man Is A Man"" and ""Cry If You Want"". But, my favorites are ""Sister Disco"" and another searing version of ""Drowned"".

The video is standard 4:3 ratio and is from videotape source. There isn't any crowd sound. They clearly had no intention of releasing this video (preferring the home video called ""Who Rocks America"" recorded later on the last two nights of this ""Farewell"" tour in Toronto, Canada). But, this is a must have for any self-respecting Who fan.

7158602,5,B00X5RLY1E,"I think this a very good recording of a great concert. It's easy to remember the Who post-Moon as being a shell, but watching this reminded me that this wasn't true. Keith is missed but, since Kenny (as he has himself said) couldn't play like Keith, it's fine that he doesn't try. So now you only have three performing geniuses to divide your attention among. And they're in great form; Pete drives the band with his (still-underrated) guitar, and with great energy, particularly since at the beginning he didn't look like he wanted to be there. Roger in some ways was at his peak, vocally, and as a performer as well. And John stood nearly motionless to the side, except that his fingers were a blur. And therein lies my one big criticism of the editing; there were so many times the focus of the video was on Roger, or Pete, or both, when the main source of the SOUND was coming from the far end of the stage! There are times during the Who's songs that John should be THE primary focus, so that you could see what you were hearing. No, he didn't jump, he didn't do any theatrics, but played the most amazing things, filling the holes that otherwise would exist in the sound. All that said, this was truly exciting to watch, capturing some songs the later incarnations no longer perform, with the musicianship and energy you'd expect from the world's greatest live band.",1435881600,15,1372,4.536290322580645

8715041,4,B00X5RLY1E,"OK, if you're a Who fan, you already are in the camp of ""they should have quit when Keith died"" or ""Kenney was ok"".  I think Kenney's a little stiff in this performance, but he's rocking the kit pretty hard on lots of the songs.

The picture and sound isn't Blu-ray quality.  This was video-taped over 30 years ago, so it's understandable.  Everything seems to have a yellow-ish hue to it. The sound is passable.

So this is somewhat of a historical show, but the band does seem a little bored at times.  But quite a few numbers are really impressive, and it's interesting to me that they put in a lot of energy on the 'newer' songs like ""Dangerous"", ""Eminence Front"" and ""It's Hard"".  ""Cry If You Want"" is absolutely amazing.  Pete's guitar playing throughout the show is excellent, I always thought this period was a high point in his career.

My favorite part of the show is the encore.  ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is part of that, and it's pretty ragged, but FUN.

So until the '82 Toronto show gets a 'proper' Blu-Ray treatment, this is the best out there of the Kenny Jones era in this format.",1480204800,,1099,4.417910447761194

8715048,2,B00X5RLY1E,"Sadly, I was greatly disappointed with The Who: Live At Shea Stadium 1982 [Blu-ray]. Honestly, I read some of the 5-Star reviews prior to my purchase and I have to wonder if those people even watched the same Blu-ray I did?

Before I start, here is some advice for any Band, Group, Singer, or Performer thinking about putting together a concert Video. Watch ""Queen: Live At Wembley Stadium"" first as a reference Video! Probably the best covered concert I have ever viewed and considering the date of the concert, 1986, the video and sound are as good as anything produced today.

With that said, Live At Shea Stadium is just the opposite.

First the Technical Details. For a Blu-ray, the image and sound are crap. I really wish there was a certification process for something to be labeled ""Blu-ray"". The ""video"" on this disk is no better than VHS quality. In fact, I've seen VHS videos with much better quality.

The Audio is also horrid. I have a very respectable sound system and this video sounds like the entire concert was recorded in just the Mid-range and the Highs and Lows were clipped. There was very little Bass (especially when you had one of the best bass guitarists- John Entwistle  on stage). The whole thing sounds muffled. I was even doubting if there is actually an LFE (Low-frequency effects) channel on the disk. As for the ""Highs"", I think my tweeters got the night off.

What also ruins it, is that they didn't even have (or they excluded) the crowd audio. Every time they ended a song it sounded like The Who was playing at an empty stadium. Same is true when they would play one of their fan favorite classics, i.e. ""My Generation"". Usually you would hear a ""roar"" from the fans. This is the song they want. It's a classic. What do you hear on the video? Que the crickets.

I was fortunate to see The Who on that same tour at Oakland Coliseum on October 23, 1982. I remember a bright lit stage, an array of colored lights, and colorful graphic side panels. Either The Who didn't have the money for set design at this venue, or the recording or post processing screwed it up.

The video color is also very poor and the image is very dark. Maybe due to the fact it was recorded on Video Tape and not Filmed.

Now the Production Details: I'm not sure if it's due to the emergence of MTV at the time, but when I want to watch a concert, I want to WATCH A CONCERT! Leave the damn special effects out of it. The rapid zoom-in-zoom-out, exposure over exposure, and trailing-image video effects are very annoying.

I'm not sure how many cameras they used, but it probably wasn't more than four.

As for the ""energy"" of the performers, I'm not sure if was due to the poor quality of the audio track or what. But you almost get the feeling The Who phoned this one in. And of course Roger Daltrey is wearing his Shoulder Pad Blazer (a staple of the 80's) which I am sure lowers the energy (far from the open-shirted Roger during the '73 tour)

One positive. The Song set was very good. It had all of my favorites and then some:

1) Substitute
2) I Can't Explain
3) Dangerous
4) Sister Disco
5) The Quiet One
6) It's Hard
7) Eminence Front
8) Behind Blue Eyes
9) Baba O Riley
10) I'm One
11) The Punk And The Godfather
12) Drowned
13) Tattoo
14) Cry If You Want
15) Who Are You
16) Pinball Wizard
17) See Me Feel Me
18) Love Reign O'er Me
19) Long Live Rock
20) Won't Get Fooled Again
21) Young Man Blues
22) Naked Eye
23) I Saw Her Standing There
24) Summertime Blues
25) Twist And Shout

Yes, sad to say this is not the video I was hoping for. I am sure there has to be quality film of The Who sitting somewhere just waiting for the right person to produce a reference disk. Unfortunately, this isn't it.",1456617600,13,3719,4.355491329479769
