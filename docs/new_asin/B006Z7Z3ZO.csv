5040013,5,B006Z7Z3ZO,Watching Dark Shadows Fan Favorites brought back great memories when I started watching the series when I was in 7th grade..I could hardly wait to get home and watch it. Anyone who is a Dark Shadows Fan I highly suggest you get this. Well worth watching :),1345593600,,256,4.468085106382978
5040014,1,B006Z7Z3ZO,"It was great fun to watch!  A real TEASER; Makes you want more!

5040015,2,B006Z7Z3ZO,"There were many more episodes, in my opinion, better than these with the exception of Barnabas introducing himself to Elizabeth, which was indeed pivotal. The other choices had me trying to remember, ""What the heck happened next?"" I find the format very jarring, and the commentary was not that good, either. Save your money people, and buy the DVD sets of the episodes.",1339977600,,370,4.888888888888889
5040016,2,B006Z7Z3ZO,I'm sorry to say being a long time DS viewrer I was very disappointed in the selections chosen for this Fan Favorites video! I could name at least 10 other episodes that would have been more interesting! I cannot recommend this!,1339632000,,228,4.585365853658536
5040017,4,B006Z7Z3ZO,Dark Shadows is just as addicting as I remembered it to be. Now instead of playing hookey from school I can watch the dvd's when I want!,1339632000,,136,4.074074074074074
5040018,5,B006Z7Z3ZO,"This is a very satisfying collection of 9 of the most memorable Dark Shadows episodes, encompassing almost all of the different eras of the show (or should I say some of the most pivotal plot points in the ongoing story?). We start in black and white, when Barnabas introduces himself to Elizabeth Stoddard as her English ""cousin"" (very suave move). His manners so charm the Collins matriarch that discrepancies in his story are forever overlooked. Everyone is instead worried over the disappearance of the threatening Willy Loomis, little realizing he's already become the vampire's minion. We quickly move to color, sitting in on a very 1960s-style mod seance that shockingly transports the governess Victoria Winters back to 1795, to solve the mystery of Barnabas' ghostly sister Sara. There follows our first meeting with Angelique, the witch who bedevils Barnabas across time, played perfectly by one of TV's best-ever ice queens, the blonde beauty Lara Parker.

Jumping ahead, Dr. Hoffman figures out that Quentin Collins is a werewolf, and as Julia and Barnabas become cohorts at solving the mysteries of Collinwood, they travel to Parallel Time, where familiar faces act out a version of Rebecca (with Grayson Hall excelling in the Mrs. Danvers role), and to the future where Collinwood lies in ruins, and Caroline and Quentin have gone insane. A very young Kate Jackson appears as the mysterious ghost Daphne, another governess with a secret, enlivening the show's later years.

Through all, we see the famous Collinwood set, the medieval staircase that frames so much of the action, and you can watch each numbered episode with informative introductions by Kathryn Leigh Scott, who played Maggie Evans through all her perils in past, present, future and parallel time. The show takes itself so seriously, you're instantly immersed in its dream-like world, and you almost don't mind not having the cliffhangers add up; you still get a full picture of what made the first ever gothic soap opera so appealing, and so enduring.",1338076800,45,2033,5.138972809667674
5040019,4,B006Z7Z3ZO,"I had a blast watching these nine episodes, which are better pick than the uneven&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-Best-of-Barnabas/dp/B006Z7Z3PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows: Best of Barnabas</a>. There is a werewolf, ghosts, a witch, demon possession, time travel and a parallel timeline in this collection. The first three episodes are my favorites, where Barnabas introduces himself as a cousin to the Collins family; during a freaky sance Victoria Winters travels back to the year 1795; and the witch Angelique tries to hurt Barnabas. The video resolution is better than the previous collection. Make sure to look for a few Dark Shadows famous bloopers/mistakes, as the actors flub their lines and you can clearly see the microphone boom shadow in several scenes. The Fan Favorites DVD should satisfy most Dark Shadows fans and introduce the series to a new generation.",1337731200,29,940,6.022388059701493
5040020,5,B006Z7Z3ZO,"To coincide with the long-awaited release of ""Dark Shadows"" in theatres in May, 2012 MPI Video is releasing three collections the month before on April 12th. This set called ""Fan Favorites"" runs about 180 minutes and since the original ABC daytime soap ran for thirty minutes each day I would believe we will see about six episodes on this disc. This set and ""The Best of Barnabas"" are obviously aimed at people who only have a remote interest in the original daytime serial and they are priced very reasonably.

 This reasonably priced single-disc DVD will feature 9 episodes with brand new introductions.

 However, on April 12th if your a major fan of ""Dark Shadows"" and of classic vintage soaps like me look for ""Dark Shadows-The Complete Collection"" that will feature every single episode of the series along with a slew of bonus features. Personally, I am in Heaven and cannot wait for that set!",1327190400,38,901,4.8311688311688314
5040021,5,B006Z7Z3ZO,"A very good compilation of 9 episodes from different eras of the show. As I cannot afford the complete series set (and what DS fan wouldn't want it?)

If you are not familiar with the show, the continuity won't make much sense, but if you remember the show from back in the day, you'll rekindle fond memories.",1415059200,,337,4.365079365079365

5040026,3,B006Z7Z3ZO,"These episodes are really the fan favorites??

I agree with the episode showing the seance that sent Vicki back in time.

But here are some episodes that I think should have been put on this DVD:

1) The episode where Barnabas shoots Angelique and she places the vampire curse on him
2) The episode where Edward Collins finds Barnabas in his coffin in the Old House cellar
3) The episode where everyone flees Collinwood and Quentin is alone at the top of the steps laughing
4) The episode where Adam is brought to life
5) The episode where Barnabas is walled up in the cellar of the Old House by Rev Trask
6) The episode where Trask is walled up in the cellar of the Old House by Barnabas to get his revenge
7) The final episode of the series",1402444800,2,742,4.285714285714286

5040045,4,B006Z7Z3ZO,"It's always a very bold step when a company releases a DVD of a show with the phrases ""Fan Favourites"" and ""The Greatest Episodes"" splashed over the front cover.  It's especially difficult when the show is DARK SHADOWS, the legendary gothic daytime soap opera which notched up over 1,000 episodes during its original 1966-71 run on ABC.  To whittle the series down to 9 key episodes would be an unenviable task, but one which MPI has done in a very thoughtful way.

For in DARK SHADOWS, as the fans know, the story and its characters frequently leapt backwards, forwards and even sideways in time, creating a seemingly never-ending multitude of dramatic possibilities.  This collection spotlights episodes from many of the show's eras (including the original leap back to 1795); and most of the popular characters, including Barnabas, Dr Julia Hoffman, Quentin, Maggie/Josette, Angelique, Reverend Trask, Daphne Harridge and Victoria Winters.

Episodes:

#212 - After having been freed from his chained coffin, Barnabas (Jonathan Frid) returns to Collinwood where he finds the Old House in ruins and swears his plan of redemption to the portrait of Josette.

#365 - The Collins family resolve to hold a sance in a bid to contact the ghost of little Sarah Collins (Sharon Smyth), Barnabas' younger sister, who has already appeared to Maggie (Kathryn Leigh Scott) and David (David Henesy).  The sance comes to its shocking conclusion when Victoria (Alexandra Moltke) disappears only to somehow find herself swept back in time to 1795.

#371 - In 1795-era Collinwood, Barnabas is almost killed by vengeful former lover and witch Angelique (Lara Parker), when she casts a spell to choke Barnabas with an invisible handkerchief.  *This episode is incorrectly-labelled as being #370 on the DVD case.

#699 - Back in regular time, Dr Julia Hoffman (Grayson Hall) and Barnabas must race against time to help Chris Jennings (Don Briscoe), who is under a werewolf curse.

#725 - Once more backwards in time (1897 to be exact), Barnabas is again caught up in the web of evil surrounding Quentin Collins (David Selby) and young Jamison Collins (Henesy), who appears to be possessed by Quentin's spirit.

#1024 - In 1970 Parallel Time, the familiar Collinwood characters re-enact a variation of ""Rebecca"", with Alexis Stokes (Lara Parker), the ""twin sister"" of Quentin's former wife Angelique, sabotaging new bride Maggie Collins' marriage by tricking her into wearing one of Angelique's gowns during a costume ball.

#1065 - Barnabas and Julia travel ahead in time to the year 1995, where they find Collinwood to be a decrepit wreck with only an insane Carolyn (Nancy Barrett) and Quentin remaining.

#1102 - Determined to stop whatever horrors which occurred in 1995, Barnabas and Julia return to 1970 where they must protect David from his premature death.  The ghost of Daphne Harridge (Kate Jackson) is the key to his salvation.  Meanwhile, Maggie becomes the target of a mystery vampire.

#1115 - Using the alias of an obscure Collins family relative, Julia follows Barnabas back to 1840, where she must stop him from seducing the lovely Roxanne Drew (Donna Wandrey).

Each episode comes with an optional introduction from Kathryn Leigh Scott, so newer viewers won't find themselves struggling to identify the characters and the stories' shifts in time.  Sure, DARK SHADOWS fans could have suggested some other important plot points (Angelique's ""Dream Curse"", Josette's final moments on Widows' Hill, Laura Collins revealed as the ""Fire Phoenix"" and maybe even the very first episode), but for what is covered in this DVD, MPI have done a remarkable job.

Just don't be surprised if you find yourself buying some of the larger DARK SHADOWS collections - this show is like a bag of potato chips... you cannot stop once you've started!",1357862400,12,3827,5.110754414125201

I would rush home, grab a snack and curl up to watch all the thrilling events that would befall the residents of Collinsport!  Barnabas was my favorite villian/hero, able to win your heart and frighten you at the same time.  Angelique, Quentin and so many memorable characters came out of Dark Shadows.  They grew on us and we wanted to know more about who they were and who they were becoming as the show continued to air till 1971.  I highly recommend checking out Dark Shadows.  Yes, there are the occasional bloopers here and there but, it was filmed live, so mistakes were bound to happen.

You're just throwing us into the middle of the drama without explaining how it all started, & without showing us any resolution to any of them; why would you do that to us?!"" So overall, although every episode was wonderful, presenting them to us without context, without any of the proceeding or succeeding episodes, causes the viewer to be left with both a confused & unfulfilled feeling. It would have been better if they would have included whole story arcs, giving the viewer actual stories, actual plots, to enjoy.",1438905600,,766,4.639705882352941
