7125633,5,B00W7AHJ0U,Great movie! Very similar to the 2010 film they did and a great gift idea!,1448236800,2,74,4.0
7125634,2,B00W7AHJ0U,A cheaply and quickly put together video by the NHL claims they have extended views into the locker room ...it was about 5 minutes after the Cup victory with no interviews.  It was just basically a collage of goals being scored without explanation of where series stood at any one time.  Very little behind the scenes or historical references,1448150400,4,342,4.779661016949152

Tried it in multiple players and does the same thing on each of them.",1445040000,,247,4.276595744680851

7125645,5,B00W7AHJ0U,How else can I rate this but excellent!  I'm glad that the 2013 film was included on the blu ray.  Now I have all 3 Championship films.  It was a poor decision to release the 2013 on digital only.,1443312000,,196,3.9743589743589745
7125646,5,B00W7AHJ0U,Hard to go wrong with the CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS!!! Little more locker room celebration and parade coverage would have been good though.,1443139200,,132,5.333333333333333

7125648,5,B00W7AHJ0U,"The 2010 bluray was decent....the downloadable 2013 video was complete garbage. They righted a wrong with this one. Excellent audio and video quality here and loaded with content. For those of you lucky enough not to waste your time on the 2013 video, it's included in the Extras on this one along with a ton of other stuff. Must have for all Hawk fans.",1442534400,8,353,4.53125

7125658,3,B00W7AHJ0U,"Disappointing that it is a region A disk which means you cannot watch it outside north America. Why this is not region free just amazes me. My own fault for buying it but then I had 17 seconds in blu ray which works fine so never thought to look.

Come on NHL....have some love for folks in Europe.",1440633600,6,298,4.137931034482759

7125662,5,B00W7AHJ0U,"This is definitely the best made of the 3 championship videos.  seems like they just get better each time they do it.  and a BIG BONUS for blu-ray: it includes the FULL 2013 Championship video that was absurdly released as an online/download only video in 2013.  (for clarification, this is NOT the ""17 Seconds"" video).  I personally wrote the NHL customer service a scathing complaint about how ridiculous it was that it wasn't offered as a DVD/blu-ray.  2 years later, I'm pleasantly surprised by this unexpected extra.  die hard Hawks fans are already buying this so this review isn't for you.  if you're on the fence for this one, grab the blu-ray while you can cuz it's a 2-for-1 special (literally) and it's not going to be around forever",1439942400,11,744,4.72093023255814

8712407,5,B00W7AHJ0U,"Excellent quality Blu-Ray, great video and audio. It's hard to determine what Hawks team is better: 2013 or 2015. The 2013 Championship video was well-done all around and included some amazing moments. The 2015 team against Anaheim really got the job done. Memories I'll cherish for a lifetime.
