8498656,3,B006ID5PK8,"I'm glad to know I wasn't the only person disappointed with this DVD set by one of my favorite draughtsmen, Anthony Ryder. I don't know if he teaches his classes the way he did on the video, but I doubt it.  The production was terrible and I attempted to watch it several times over a year and sadly bored. The introduction was a bit flashy, but I felt that when Anthony began teaching, he was not fully engaged or perhaps had ""stage fright"" at being recorded.  I will keep my books if I want to learn from him! (I sold the video on Amazon, and hoped that the buyer found a way to learn despite my poor experience).",1412035200,4,615,4.203389830508475

8498658,2,B006ID5PK8,"I purchased the 2-DVD set almost a year ago and had really high hopes since i also have his book. But unfortunately, the DVD's production quality really interferes with whatever instruction is being given.  The lighting on the drawing paper is so bright that it washes out the contrast between the drawing and the paper. The camera angles also either crop some of the actual drawing process or do not represent the relationship between the model and the what Tony sees as he draws.  There is no question that he is the master of draftsmanship, but the issues mentioned greatly detracted from the overall quality.  If I had been able to see a decent preview in advance, i would not have purchased it.",1354147200,18,699,4.666666666666667
