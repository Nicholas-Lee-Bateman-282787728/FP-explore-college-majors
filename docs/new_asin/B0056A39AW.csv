8459313,5,B0056A39AW,"This is absolute gold. If you are in any way interested in kettlebell sport, and don't have access to a Russian coach, this is a must-have. I received my copy only a few days ago but have already watched every video several times. The depth and precision of the nuances is astounding, and very well thought out. The presentation can seem a bit dry at times, but rest assured - if you are after results in kettlebell sport, such attention to detail is mandatory.",1505001600,,461,4.5
8459314,5,B0056A39AW,"A great method to learn the three competition lift  girevoy sport or kettlebell lifting.
Really deep explanations in understandable English. It will be great a Kettlebell Systema volume II to explain competition training.
I strongly recommend",1464134400,,242,5.722222222222222
8459315,5,B0056A39AW,"Boring at first but turned into a very inspirational video after i became willing to plan a purchase of adjustable kettlebells from a premier national partner of the Canadian Olympic team. teaches drills for each of the phases for jerk, snatch and longcycle. well worth the three digits i was able to afford in Canadian dollars because the techniques taught are for: kettlebell sport, strategies included for competition. I'm interested in buying more DVDs under the Shihan label now. this needs to be on amazon.ca",1451433600,,514,5.0588235294117645
8459316,5,B0056A39AW,"This is the best kettlebell DVD I've ever seen. The instructions are very clear. The three competition lifts are explained and then seperated in phases. For each phase Kanygin shows drills with increasing difficulty that allow to practice parts of the lifts. Kanygin's approach is therefore to let you practice each phase of the lift seperately and only when you mastered the drills you can put them together and practice the full lifts. I like this apporach better then just starting with a very light bell and the full lifts from the start. It allows to practice details and parts of the lifts even slowly which is not possible when just doing the full lifts.
In addition to these very detailed instructions to the lifts Kanygin also gives training plans for beginners and intermediates. The latter practice already the full lifts and add drills to work on specific weaknesses. He also discusses some specific strategies for competitions.
All in all I am really glad to have purchased this DVD set. For everyone who is interested in girevoy sport or just in how to lift kettlebells in an effective manner this is the right choice.",1414108800,2,1132,4.84020618556701
8459317,5,B0056A39AW,"In this DVD set, Dennis Kanygin teaches the lifts required for kettlebell sport (also known as Giveroy Sport), the jerk, the snatch, and the long cycle (clean and jerk).  Coach Kanygin is an engineer by training; his instruction reflects this by being very precise, methodical, using a step-by-step approach.

The emphasis of this style of kettlebell lifting is performance; the kettlebell's trajectory is made as efficient as possible, using as much of the body as possible to help perform the movement.  Practitioners of the so called ""hard-style"" method of kettlebell training can still benefit from this instruction by learning how to make certain portions of the movements more efficient, especially with regard to the snatch and the clean.

I own many kettlebell DVDs.  Kettlebell Systema provides the most thorough examination of these lifts of any video instruction that I know of.  Although it does provide some guidance on programming, it is not a kettlebell workout DVD; while it does provide excellent and methodical instruction on how to perform the lifts, it does not contain any segments where you work out with the instructor.  I happen to like this approach, but if you want to be lead through a workout, you will need some other DVD too.",1398988800,5,1255,5.063106796116505
8459318,5,B0056A39AW,"5 hours of training on three exercises. If this is the kind of detailed instruction you are looking for to improve your KB form, this is a great investment. The teaching is well done, and with great clarity.",1384560000,4,207,4.473684210526316
8459319,5,B0056A39AW,"This is a great training dvd, that covers the sport of Kettlebells. It is broken up into small drills, that when put together give you the proper execution of each lift.",1378771200,2,169,4.483870967741935
8459320,5,B0056A39AW,"I was introduced to kettlebells through Crossfit 3 years ago and have since purchased books by Pavel and pursued the many resources on the internet available for improving one's knowledge of kettlebell lifting technique.

Unfortunately there is a lot of misinformation out there and it is easy to waste time and money on hucksters who know more about marketing than kettlebells.

This DVD is the real deal--for a few dollars you have a reliable guide to effective and safe technique that you can learn from for months. Thorough, clear and detailed explanations with lots of drills to reinforce correct technique. It is all you need. I wish I had found out about Denys Kanygin a long time ago.",1373414400,2,692,4.8559322033898304
8459321,5,B0056A39AW,"Thorough, clear and informative.

I have watched many tutorial on
