7863627,5,6304107021,"I bought this because I am a huge fan of the Monkees, and Davy Jones of the Monkees voices the Artful Dodger! Davy came to the United States as a teenager to play the Artful Dodger on Broadway, so I love hearing him in that role. Just to be clear, the songs in this movie are not the well known songs from the Broadway musical; but Davy does sing one song ""Man About Town"" as the Dodger. There are a few minor concerns for parents; characters calling each other ""jackass""; the visible shadow of Bill Sykes body hanging; and Nancy's murder is clear but you don't see it happen. Also, Bill's dog seems to enjoy being kicked. All these are very mild compared to what kids watch nowadays. I just wanted to let viewers know what they are in for. Dickens does have some dark subject matter, but it's a great story. As long as you can get past a toad that eats bananas befriending Oliver, you will enjoy this version of the classic tale.",1425168000,,930,4.32

7863629,5,6304107021,"Love watching Oliver Twist in animated form, great for the whole family, great songs to sing along too. Being an orphan, picking pockets, getting caught and having a happy ending is the best. Easy for the kids to understand. Enjoyable for the whole family. highly recommend",1392508800,2,273,4.956521739130435
7863630,2,6304107021,Purchased to be enjoyed with 10 year old grandchild. I was disappointed but didn't say anything until she asked if we could watch something else. We had to agree... our expectations were too ambitious for this Twist.,1388016000,,216,4.864864864864865
7863631,5,6304107021,"This is an excellent adaptation that leaves out some of the more sinister elements/overtones.  There are no bawdy barroom scenes.  Levity is provided by the addition of several animals.  Oliver has a pet toad named Squeakers, Fagin has a parrot that ""parrots"" back Fagin's words (even when it gets him in trouble), there are a few more birds in the thieves abode and a cat.  Naturally the cat scraps with Bill Sike's dog Bullseye, providing a comedic break.

Other than being somewhat disappointed/annoyed by the lack of ""color"" in Fagin's voice, I found this thoroughly entertaining.  It follows the book quite well for a 90 min. version.  It is for the young set, grades K-1 to 5-6.

It will be more palatable to many families than the G rated Broadway film, Oliver Twist,  The Musical.  The latter is more touching, heartbreaking, and real for some sensitive youngsters.  It is over the top wonderful for all... except ages 0-7 or 8.

Addl Note---My copy says 1973 on the back.",1300492800,,980,4.767857142857143
