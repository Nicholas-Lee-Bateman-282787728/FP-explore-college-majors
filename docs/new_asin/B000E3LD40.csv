8105186,4,B000E3LD40,"I just did this workout today for the first time.  It is really fun.  The first half I caught onto fairly quickly.  The second half was a bit trickier.  But that's great because I love the challenge and it doesn't get as boring.  It's about a 50 min step workout with a quick stretch and core workout.  You will want an exercise ball for the core section.  I like Ann Marie's personality.  She is really mellow.  I am used to Seasun and Cathe workouts, so I didn't feel the cardio level was challenging enough.  I used 2 steps and it did help make it more challenging, but not quite enough for me.  Maybe once I have the workout down a little better,  I can add a little higher impact moves.  Check out Collagevideo for a minute preview.  The main reason I gave this 4 stars is because the visual seemed a bit jumpy and is a little annoying.  Maybe it's just my player, but I don't have the problem with anything else I own.",1359936000,,924,4.2298850574712645
8105187,5,B000E3LD40,"Update: I'm so sad to see this isn't available anymore! I still do this work out to this day - in fact this morning. It's been over 10 years! It's a great addition to my library, adding variety to my routine. I still love step even though it's out of fashion now.  Thanks, Ann Marie for a great work out vid!

Yes it is hard. It took me 4-5 times doing the video to catch on. But that's what you want: if you catch on right away, be prepared to be bored with that video soon. I consider myself intermediate and I love this video. It comes in two parts (the second part starts with an L-step routine). Tackle the first part only. Have your DVD remote handy and just keep rewinding the steps until you get them. You'll still be getting a great workout. After a few times doing this, you'll have it. Then try the same with part 2. Decent music, fun moves, advanced workout, and the instructor has a low annoyance factor. An absolute staple in my collection.",1224633600,,954,4.265193370165746
8105188,4,B000E3LD40,"I like this DVD. It has a concise instructor, good modifications, and a very lengthy step program (over 40 minute of step).  The choreography is fun and interesting, but be careful, this is advanced.
I workout to different aerobic DVD's and step happens to be my favorite (at home) because I can get a good workout and keep my heartrate up.  I would consider myself an intermediate stepper based on the amount of time I step each week (over 2 hours) and the length of time (more that 3 years).
I found this difficult, but, I appreciate a DVD that is a challenge.  It gives me something to work toward and a feeling of accomplishment when I complete it correctly.
You will like this one if, like me, you like a challenge and to step for over 1/2 hour.",1209340800,,750,4.381294964028777
8105189,3,B000E3LD40,"I found this video very hard to follow and I consider myself an experienced stepper as I've been doing it for 15 years.  As one of the reviews commented, she adds A LOT of spins and pivots, so you need to be an advanced stepper to keep up ... especially since you are trying to see her step while your back is turned away from the TV. (And you are not behind the instructor as in a class setting.)  Some of her moves are off beat which is hard to follow if you are a rhythmic person like I am.",1144886400,6,493,3.92
8105190,5,B000E3LD40,"I always like buying new workouts because I don't want to get bored.  I hadn't heard of this instructor before but thought I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did.  She's good.  It's a step workout (my favourite) and it's non-stop.  She won't even slow down to teach you the moves.  You therefore should be experienced in step aerobics so you aren't left behind.  She includes spins and pivots to make it interesting and she has great cuing whether it be with her hand or verbal.  After you've sweated your head off, there is a ab workout done on a stability ball.  This is a great dvd to have in your workout collection.  I love it.",1143849600,,630,4.271186440677966
