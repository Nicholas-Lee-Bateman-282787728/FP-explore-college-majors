8171686,1,B000MTA2MA,Well I have to say I wish I could have seen this performance on dvd. The cd is great. However this was a non-starter . I figured this would be problematic since nothing was in English on the credits & looked cheap:what little  I could see. CD would not play after pressing concert or any other extras. Motorhead is a favorite band of mine . Too bad this lineup dosn't have better quality visual footage than this . I recommend avoiding this label entirely,1455062400,,455,4.416666666666667
8171687,4,B000MTA2MA,"not the best motorhead dvd, but a good one",1430611200,,42,3.7777777777777777
8171688,3,B000MTA2MA,"This is just a DVD version of the VHS tape and not the best quality either.  Is a much darker picture than the VHS.  Still it, unlike my VHS tape' is not worn out and stretched in places.",1425686400,,187,3.8947368421052633
8171689,5,B000MTA2MA,Essential for any Moorhead collection. This is a GREAT concert!,1423958400,,63,5.4
8171690,5,B000MTA2MA,"This is an absolute top-notch performance!! The menus are in Portuguese, but the concert itself is all English. Sound quality is excellent, with a full, but gritty two-guitar sound. The band starts off mainly with their slow- tempo material, but the second half, beginning with ""Ace Of Spades"", is almost all fast and furious! Most of those are played faster than the studio versions. This DVD proves that Motorhead are the Ramones' evil brothers, especially in the second half!",1359849600,2,478,5.063291139240507
8171691,5,B000MTA2MA,No Doubt -This Is The One That Most Motorhead Fans Don't Know About- There Is Not One Soft Spot In This Concert- The Band Is Spot-On And Lemmy's Singing Is The Best I Ever Heard Him Sing Live-Besides The Hammersmith Concert.  I Bought This As Am Import When It First Came Out In 1985- It's Been My Go To Concert When I Want To Rock Some Motorhead Live In Concert-I've Turned On Many A Friends To This Live Show And All Agree That The Show Kicks Ass And Is Top Dog.,1309305600,2,464,4.0989010989010985
8171692,4,B000MTA2MA,"I purchased this DVD at a national chain store in 2008 for nostalgic reasons. It didn't disappoint (except for the sound glitch during ""Killed by Death""; I returned it but the new DVD had the exact same glitch so it's likely in the entire pressing). The energy is great and the execution flawless. If you are a Motorhead fan, you will enjoy this!",1284508800,2,346,4.507936507936508
