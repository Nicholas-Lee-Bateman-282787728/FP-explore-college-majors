3867165,4,B0027FG1J0,DVD was in very good shape and of good quality. Just wished it had more actual footage. Good purchase for the price though.,1284940800,3,123,4.391304347826087
3867166,5,B0027FG1J0,"Insightful and compelling story about a long overlooked group of WWII heroes. The filmmakers did a wonderful job of compiling hundreds of pieces of historical and anecdotal information to cobble together a coherent and eye-opening story about the bravery and heroics of this group of men who fought battles on two fronts, at home and abroad. Several first-hand accounts are shown through interviews of the men. Very educational.",1256860800,10,428,5.3088235294117645
3867167,5,B0027FG1J0,"There's a certain irony to this film and others of its ilk where we find Afro-American soldiers going to war in other countries in the name of democracy, freedom and equality when they themselves did not enjoy or benefit from the same in their own country at the time.  And yet there is in this recount of the 761st tank batallion a heart-wrenching and, at the same time, awe-inspiring commentary on tenacity, teamwork and the extraordinary resilience of the human spirit. A viewing of the 761st Black Battalion will almost certainly have an impact on your views about WW II but, more important, it will certainly have a significant impact on your life view and your personal interpretation of the philosophical saw about 'man's inhumanity toward man'.",1253145600,13,752,4.921259842519685
3867168,5,B0027FG1J0,"Moving, surprising, and informative.  Something of a black history buff, I was stunned to see this documentary and learn so much about something that I knew absolutely nothing about.  There is a lot of information that one can find regarding World War II that shows how heroic our army was, but very little of it has focused on African American or other soldiers of color.  This movie covers specific details about one of three black tank division lost in the back pages of history that many, many people (especially younger people) never learn about in school.  My thanks to the producers for giving this story a chance to be known.

The personal interviews really bring this movie to life. The emotions that the soldier share are so ""in your face"", so ""right there"" for all to see, that viewers can't help but feel as if you are right there talking with the guys.  Heroes by any definition, they come across so matter of fact that they could easily be your neighbor or relative sitting in your living room talking about the past.

If you haven't already, buy it and view it.  You will learn a lot and be glad that you did.",1252368000,14,1124,4.52970297029703
3867169,5,B0027FG1J0,This film is a must see for all Americans. The film delivers the goods on a story that needed to be shared. The soldiers of the 761st before their death shared a moving history. This is the best documentary of the year.,1252108800,7,219,4.238095238095238
3867170,5,B0027FG1J0,"Powerful!  Many know the story of the famed Tuskegee Airmen,  but not that of the 761st Tank Battalion.  I viewed this documentary with a group of old friends.  We were absolutely riveted to the story.  There was no discussion during its airing, except for some visceral reactions and expressions of amazement from time-to-time. Revelations and lessons to be shared............",1251072000,7,377,5.322033898305085
3867171,5,B0027FG1J0,"This documentary is touching, infuriating and inspiring.  I never knew the story of the 761st Tank Battalion.  I cannot believe I never knew.  And neither will you.  You have to check this movie and share it with everyone.  The story must be told over and over again... Pete Chatmon does a wonderful job of telling it.",1243641600,4,318,4.607142857142857

8354656,5,B0027FG1J0,A great documentary about the unheralded bravery and commitment of the African American soldier in Wold War II. These men suffered untold hardship in combat in addition to the rampant racism that was present in some parts of our country  and yet served with honor and distinction asking nothing in return except respect!,1429401600,2,320,5.037735849056604
8354657,5,B0027FG1J0,AFTER all these years of no credit for help to win the war the black man credit is long over due. BACK in the day film maker would skip over the black troops and not even call out their units.the time has come to give credit,1393200000,2,224,3.891304347826087
8354658,5,B0027FG1J0,I never knew about the Black Tankers only the Tuskegee Airman. Why this place we call land of the free and home of the brave involved the accompolishments of the White American soldier is so baffling. Thank you so much for sharing with me the great efforts made by the Black Tankers and how significant their efforts were in helping win the wars and liberate so many civilians.,1356307200,4,377,4.5588235294117645
