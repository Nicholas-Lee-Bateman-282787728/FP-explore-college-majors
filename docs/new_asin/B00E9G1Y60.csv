8602971,5,B00E9G1Y60,"I am an adult beginner, with no previous experience of ballet. I have practiced with Finiss Absolute Beginner DVDs for about a year, and the improvement in strength and balance that I have been seeing as a result of that have given me the motivation to try his Basic Ballet Movement Skills collection.

This first DVD of the series introduces the viewer to three basic steps: Pas de Bourre, Glissade, and Chasse. Each step is taught with different variations of movements that precede and complete the step, and at a different speed. For each step, there is a verbal instruction, followed by a slow, to-a-count demonstration to music, and finally a complete demonstration in real time. As I have come to expect from Finiss videos, the DVD is packed with information, pleasing aesthetically, and features Finiss signature thorough-going instruction.

One thing that really stood out for me was that, even as Finis is teaching these specific steps, all of his instruction was geared, and pedagogically shrewdly paced, to enable movement: there is never a simple static position-memorization, but each exercise, building on the one before, leads to a more and more fluid movement across the floor. Even when Finis instructs you in the steps, what he really teaches is DANCING!

Aside from the impeccable description, I found it very helpful that Finis pointed out, and Antonio demonstrated, the most common mistakes that people make when performing these movements. I found myself nodding silently, as I thought of the falling-over pas de bourre-s and wobbly glissades that I myself saw--and committed!--in the past. It was helpful to see these mistakes enacted and analyzed, to understand the correct movement better. I also appreciated the fact that Finis explicitly reflected on the difference between Antonios professional ability/physique and those of the amateur viewer: his tips on adjusting the position and movement to account for a less-than-perfect turnout were extremely helpful.

In contrast with the red series, there is a marked progress in the level of skill. This DVD really takes you on the next level. Finis delves into the proper use of the arms, head, and breathingand, doing what he says achieves remarkable things to secure the balance and fluidity of movement. He also explains and expects improvement in musicality: mere moving to beat is no longer sufficient; the musical score is syncopated, and so the movement must be.

Finally, and almost imperceptibly, Finis is expanding the viewers ballet vocabulary (we are introduced to tombe, assemble, difference between dessous and dessus, etc.), and he even begins to speak about the characteristic features of different ballet schools (e.g., Balanchines emphasis on quickness of movement, proper articulation of the feet, and engaged, on the attack quality of dance). This linguistic and cultural elements may appear as not important for the actuality of working out; but Finis recognizes (I think rightly so) that for many adult learners of ballet, the culture and language of the art can never be separated from the movement.

So, as before, I am astounded by the breadth, depth, and intentionality of Finiss teaching. I see myself returning to this DVD again and againnot only for practice, but for referenceand I strongly recommend it to others.",1481414400,11,3319,5.205992509363296

8602973,5,B00E9G1Y60,"I am so glad I discovered this video which shows you how to do pas de bourres, glissades and chasss. The exercises are first explained in detail by Finis Jhung and then are demonstrated masterfully and elegantly by Antonio Carmena, soloist with New York City Ballet. I was particularly pleased to notice how the pace of a step changes from slow to moderate and then quickly in dance tempo just as it is done on stage. The glissadewhich is tricky for beginnersis explained in clearly with allowances made for the beginner who does not have perfect turn-out and a tight fifth position. However, you can still move beautifully if you apply the concepts taught and just use what you have. In addition, I loved how the DVD has three modes of playing: full class, specific exercises and only workout mode. Scott Killians music is lovely and makes me feel like Im doing little dances. I strongly recommend this DVD to both adult beginners and young dancers who want to learn how to do these steps correctly so that they will not pick up bad habits. I cannot say enough good things about this DVD!Ileana L. Ray, Brooklyn, NY",1462320000,2,1116,4.641414141414141
8602974,5,B00E9G1Y60,"I began ballet training as an adult 4 years ago after seeing a stage production of Billy Elliot, which touched me so deeply because I too wanted to dance when I was a young boy and was prevented from doing so.  I have learned SO MUCH from Finis Jhung's DVD's thus far, which have helped me in my classes, and will continue to purchase and study them. Thank you, Finis, you're amazing!",1460505600,2,384,4.333333333333333
8602975,5,B00E9G1Y60,"As an adult beginner I have difficulty translating what I have learned and done at the barre to center work. I purchased this DVD to help me between adult ballet classes to smooth out my technique and give me greater confidence. I could not be more pleased with the results. Finis is a great teacher!

I will soon be looking for Basic Ballet Movement Skills, Lessons 2 and 3!",1456704000,6,375,4.434782608695652
