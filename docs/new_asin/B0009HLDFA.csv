8060848,5,B0009HLDFA,"I have watched six of the Lupin movies now. This is my favorite year when it goes to Japanese animation, it's just so right looking. This is the most comical movie out of all of them thus far. Inspector Zenigata has more of the spotlight then usual, which was actually quite entertaining. Great movie!",1504828800,,301,4.592592592592593

8060850,5,B0009HLDFA,"Crisis in Tokyo, released in summer 1998, was the 10th Lupin made for TV movie following Walther P-38. Walter P-38 or Island of Assassins is most definitely not my favorite Lupin move with its dark tone and higher level of violence. It was co-directed by Toshiya Shinohara and Hiroyuki Yano. Shinohara returns to direct Crisis in Tokyo so I was a little worried we might get more of the same but Crisis is absolutely one of my favorite Lupin movies.

Crisis has a much brighter and lighter tone with the emphasis on the main characters. Fans of Inspector Zenigata will be absolutely delighted by his appearance. Not only is he in the film a significant amount of time but he is both hilarious and highly effective in his pursuit of Lupin. Zenigata is no bumbling fool. We even get some moments of sensitivity between him and his partner Maria. Jigen and Goemon are helping Lupin as always and the two have never been more uproarious. Lupin movies should always be character driven and this one more than any I can think of nails it and that even includes the wonderful Castle of Cagliostro.

The entire film takes place in Tokyo and it has the most Japanese feel of any Lupin film I can recall. We get scenes in both Lupins and Zenigatas very Japanese apartments. You really get a feel for Japanese culture in this film. Ive still never understood how the very French Arsene Lupin could have an entirely Japanese grandson. If the film has one failing its the plot which is about as forgettable and pointless as one can imagine and here is where it falls behind Castle of Cagliostro which remains the all-time great Lupin film. The fact is the film is such a blast I didn't even care whether the plot was great. The animation is fairly decent for a made for TV movie but really excelled at some of the action scenes. In fact Crisis in Tokyo has some of the best action of any Lupin film.

Ive reviewed a lot of Lupin films and besides Castle of Cagliostro I spend a lot of time criticizing but this is one of the few Lupin films where I have almost nothing negative to say. We even get a shower scene with Fujiko which is something Hayao Miyazaki would never have done. If you're trying to sift through the sea of good but often disappointing Lupin films this is one of the gems.",1438732800,,2278,4.471153846153846
8060851,5,B0009HLDFA,Lupins movies are always a great story line. This one is defiantly one of the better dubbed ones and good picture quality.,1389052800,,122,4.590909090909091
8060852,5,B0009HLDFA,"My previous review stated that there were scratches on the DVD.  While that is still true, the DVD plays perfectly and I am very happy with my purchase.  Because I love Lupin so much I will definitely purchase a used DVD from this company again.",1360281600,,245,4.4222222222222225
8060853,4,B0009HLDFA,"This Lupin III movie is very good. Just what every Lupin III special and movies has, good story, good music, good action-comedy scenes and etc. But even though, I don't think this is a good Lupin III movie for newcomers because the animation is not the best and there are other Lupin III specials that are better than this one.

 As always, the english version sucks because it's made from funimation, so the japanese version is more original and the voices fits the characters. The menu is OK, no big deal.",1250035200,,507,4.56043956043956
8060854,5,B0009HLDFA,"I loved every minute of it. Zenigata gets the spotlight that he deserves in this one. Tokyo Crisis has in my opinion the best ""guest"" character of all the specials. For non-Zenigata fans there's also plenty of the other characters too, and it provides all the fast-past action you almost expect from Lupin the 3rd. The music--smooth, slick and in-your-face. It even has introspective moments which you might not expect from Lupin the 3rd. And of course, it's hilarious. What can I say? Buy it!",1185926400,,493,4.811764705882353
8060855,4,B0009HLDFA,Well this one was kind of old school animation but if you can get over that and the occasional weakness in the plot it has lots of intrigue and action and stuff. Not quite as funny as some of the other Lupin movies but thats just my opinion. No nudity was a plus.,1169078400,,263,3.981132075471698
8060856,5,B0009HLDFA,"This is what Lupin is all about: good action, great comedy, a nice plot, and wonderful characters all are presented in this movie. Crisis in Tokyo is heavy on comedy, but it also has pleanty of action. Character designs are wonderful Fujiko looks stunning. The Animation is well done and the backgrounds look great.",1141084800,,315,4.851851851851852
8060857,5,B0009HLDFA,"This is what Lupin is all about: good action, great comedy, a nice plot, and wonderful characters, all of which are present in Crisis in Tokyo, and then some.

Crisis in Tokyo is heavy on the comedy, but it also has plenty of action. Character designs are wonderful here; Fujiko looks absolutely stunning. Animation is also well done, and backgrounds look good.

In this special, Lupin is after two items called the Tatsumi and Inui of Yoshinobu, which are two photographic plates that are supposed to point out the location of the a rumored treasure of massive proportions. With Goemon and Fujiko no where in sight, Lupin has to count on Jigen for help, but Jigen is not being much helpful, as he has a bad toothache that lowers his skills as a sharpshooter.

The Tatsumi and Inui of Yoshinobu are in the possession of a man called Michael Suzuki, who's also the owner of the upcoming Aquatower Hotel and Theme Park, where much of the events unfold. He is also the main villain of this special, and has a lot in store for the Lupin crew.

Fujiko shows up and invites Lupin and Jigen to a bar to catch up on old times. As it turns out, she is also after the Tatsumi and Inui, and she has Goemon on her side this time. The scene in which this happens is my favorite scene: not only does it have a wonderful atmosphere and outstanding background music (which can be found on the Lupin the Third Jazz CD), but seeing all four character just sitting down, enjoying a drink, and conversing is really something else! Jigen's conversation with Goemon in regards to Goemon's reason for teaming up with the dubious Fujiko is especially hilarious. Goemon has gotten his sword stolen for him to be put on display at the Aquatower Hotel, and as such, has been rendered somewhat useless, though not entirely, and so he teamed up with Fujiko in hopes of retrieving it.

Thus, plans are made, and events unfold with some very interesting results and many unexpected turns.

A new character is introduced in this special by the name of Maria! She is not on Lupin's side this time, but on Zenigata's, which is a nice touch. Maria is a great character with a wonderful and touching back-story that has much to do with the final outcome, but I won't spoil it for you.

This special is just plain entertaining! From the music, to the characters, to the animation, to the action, to the comedy, and many more wonderful elements, it would be a crime not to see it!

So save yourself from the wrath of Zenigata (whom we see much more of in this special) and get yourself a copy of Crisis in Tokyo! You will certainly not regret it!",1126051200,7,2608,4.498942917547569
