4599271,5,B0058KGHX6,"Simply outstanding!  This is the most complete presentation on slavery I've ever seen. It is the only presentation I've seen that gives a good timeline of historical people and events in conjunction with the political, business, religious, and social mindsets of the people in each time period; and by region of the country, wealth, religion, etc.  It has always amazed me that Americans love to talk about the Civil War, but nobody wants to talk about slavery, a major reason the war occurred.  Most American children are taught in school that slavery happened; we had the Civic War; and Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves.  But the complex political, business, moral, religious, and human issues were glazed over or not mentioned at all.  More US history topics should be presented this way.  The historians, producers, actors, and everyone associated with this production are to be commended.",1319155200,193,893,5.124137931034483
4599272,5,B0058KGHX6,"I purchased this DVD to add to my collection and I originally thought it would be just another overview of the issues and problems associated with slavery in the US.  However, this was a very good teaching video.  The segments are in such a way that you can show in parts or all together.  The segements that have actors acting out the parts go very well with the voice over. You could also mute the sound and decribe the sections for greater teaching.  It covers not only Slavery in America but the islands and how they impacted the slave trade.  This is a great collection to enhance ones library or to introduce the history of slavery to those who lack the understanding of how it all happened.  It is great for teaching in the classroom and individual knowledge.  Not a great subject but a great overview for those who lack the knowledge of this aweful past.",1319155200,313,862,4.487179487179487
4599273,5,B0058KGHX6,"Gives a much needed understanding of the earliest roots of slavery through the Civil War. It should be a part of North American History class.

4599279,5,B0058KGHX6,This has to be a must see documentary that every student and family should see.  It peels back the falsehoods and misrepresentations that have been part of the wrongheaded stereotypes that have riddled much of the fabricated stories and accounts mentioned in far too many American history books and movies.,1496361600,,306,5.12
4599280,5,B0058KGHX6,"this really shows how evil and downright ugly some people can be. With no real reason other than jealousy because you apparently don't measure up, so you try to tear down. Shame on those who choose too hate as opposed to showing love. People don't seem to realize that hate causes your skin to wither up and wrinkle, whereas love and peace will cause your skin to be supple. Research this and see for yourself. Love concurs hate everyday all day.",1494288000,,446,4.518518518518518

4599317,1,B0058KGHX6,Simply terrible. A watered down truth of how slavery really was. The narrator was boring and repetitive. Hidden Colors was more informative. Watching this just pissed me off making it seem as if slavery wasn't that bad and the slaves should have felt grateful and appreciative. Never telling how barbaric it really was. This is what happens when a white man does a documentary on slavery. If I could give this 0 stars I would. Completely terrible.,1445644800,,447,4.818181818181818

4599335,4,B0058KGHX6,"Of the Black, and dark skinned, their journey into freedom, and equality, is slightly more fraught with danger, than that of a 'woman' trying to be equal, and free of the dominance of Husband./// so to speak.  What has transpired, unto today, has lifted natives, through slavery, to a position of being equal to all, without ever returning to the ancestral home grounds, still steeped in millennium old tradition, and advancing to the same heights available to those who once owned them, and brought them to the land of opportunity.  Women have had much the same venture, and also still are working for their true equality.  Other than that, the read was very enjoyable. (smile)  God Bless the USA",1432857600,,697,4.831932773109243

4599377,5,B0058KGHX6,"Interesting and noted there is so much about slavery that has not been disclosed.  Many courageous enslaved men, women and children still have untold stories, as during that time, their stories were suppressed and died with them. That period of history was a holocaust that lasted over 200 years. Separating families and ""breeding"" people like cattle destroys the family structure. Children never experienced the love and affection of their parents because they were sold, never to be seen again.  To thrive in these conditions says a lot for the people who endured torturous conditions and were stripped of their humanity.",1416182400,3,623,5.22

4599391,3,B0058KGHX6,"This is a good introduction to the African American experience from their importation on the ""middle passage"" to the passing of the 15th amendment which gave African Americans the right to vote during reconstruction.  It does a good job of displaying some of the main historical events and at times highlights some events that are not usually covered in a high school or college American history class.  However, the production value has a lot to be desired.  There are many instances where the images on screen have little or nothing to do with what the narrator is talking about.  There are also many instances where the same footage is used in completely different contexts.  At other times the images on screen seem to be seen and only after 5 seconds does the narrator talk about them after they have already gone off the screen. It is also a straight narrative storyline with no interludes of historians giving more detail about particular events or providing context about the different interpretations or controversies that historians disagree about certain historical events. It is a good introduction but by no means does it meet the quality of a PBS/American Experience documentary.",1410134400,,1193,5.035532994923858

Very unemotional in the telling but you will have to be tough not to have tears fall in the listening.  This is what we do to each other with the law to tell us its ok if we are on the white side of that.  Watch it if you can, it will make a vegetarian out of you because you won't be able to stand  having that life/death control over another soul......no matter the species.  I believe items like this need to be shown in high schools so we never make the mistake again.  Given money I am scared we would at anytime for some people.  I can only pray I would be an underground  warrior .  A story that moved me to tears.

As they were no longer property, they were of no economic value to many whites.  They were routinely arrested for little or no cause and sent to hard labor in mines or fields.  Often worked to death.  Having worked for the Tennessee Department of Correction, and knowing it's history, I know these things happened in my state.  Blacks were routinely denied basic rights such as quality education or the right to vote.  Routinely subjected to injustice and violence.  This documentary is an eye opener that I highly recommend.

Hebrew Yisraelites, please do not be deceived by this lying, evil world, but know that Jesus Christ The Messiah/the Son of our Most High father from the tribe of Judah was and is an austere ""Black"" man, who ONLY came and died and will return for his Hebrew Yisraelite family, the Saints/the Elect/Chosen Ones = (matt 1:1-25,3:17,10:34-42,11:19,24:4-5,24)(rev 1:1-2,9-16,13:7-8,22:16)(deut 18:18,28:1-14,15,36,48-50,64,68)(micah 5:2)(heb 2:16,7:14)(john 4:22-24,5:43-47,7:37-38,8:14-18,42,11:49-51,42,14:26-28,8:32)(gen 49:12)(dan 7:9,10:5-6)(luke 1:68-71,3:23-38,21:22)(rev 7:1-4,22:16)(sirach 46:1)(rom 11:26-27)(isa 29:13,42:1,43:10,45:4-5,17)(rom 11:26-27)(col 1:12-16)(1cor 11:3,15:3-8)(2cor 11:3-4)(psa 37:28,148:14,147:19-20)(1john 4:1-3)(exo 20:2)(acts 5:31,13:23)(luke 19:21)(2sam 7:23-24)(isa 43:10)(mark 9:7).

Jesus Christ is the son of the Most High, the sacrifice and the last prophet = (col 1:13-16)(mark 9:7)(luke 2:40-42)(exo 12:1-3). rome fell in 193AD (the dark ages) and their rebirth is the renaissance period in 1453, as they/the illuminati/""white"" man decided to repaint Jesus and all the Yisraelite forefathers/prophets/disciples in their own image  = (rev 1:13-15,13:3)(mala 1:1-4)(matt 15:24,24:11-12)(job 9:24)(1maccabees 3:45-48)(jere 14:2)(dan 7:9,10:5-6)(gen 49:12)(mica 5:2)(heb 7:14)(eccl 46:1)(prov 30:4)(isa 53:8-10)(rom 11:26-27)(luke 1:68-71)(ezek 22:26-27)(2thess 2:3-8).

The romans declared death to anyone who does not worship the image of the beast = (rev 13:15). Hebrew Yisraelites/""Black"" men and women as adults are systematically deceiving their children all day everyday starting at their homes and communities, again at the corrupt, unethical schools and then parents force them to attend the atrocious, rotten churches. However, ""Blacks"" have the audacity to question the children for their ""misbehaving"" in society, but they never taught the children the laws of our Most High father  = (isa 3:5,12)(2esdras 5:8)(prov 1:10-19,22:15)(2king 2:23-24)(gen 9:6)(2cor 4:3-4)(baruch 4:6-8).

Many southerners are quick to talk about the ""illegal alien"" problem and how they are ""draining the economy"", ""taking over our culture"", blah, blah, blah.  But few will acknowledge that the reason for the so-called ""problem"" is...once again...business owners profiting off the backs of poor, uneducated people for their cheap labor.

It was creepy hearing 19th century first hand accounts and political speeches from the DVD that practically mirror some opinions that we hear in the media today.  After over 200 years of totally ignoring the constitution and systematically withholding freedom from so many, I am amazed that many in the south now like to scream ""the constitution"" and ""freedom"" as a rallying cry NOW that it fits their latest agenda.

This fact is hardly ever talked about, it is assumed that white traders just went out and captured innocent victims and took them off to the new world into slavery. Then there is the truth about how the northern industrial magnets wanted more profit so they encouraged the use of free slave labor to get more profits. Such Hypocrites, screaming about the sins of slavery, but then encouraging the use of slaves to make more money. This film also exposed the truth on the KKK and the reconstruction of the south, Black Codes and the Civil Rights movements of the 60's. The truth about the Civil War and the thoughts on its expansion into the new territories of the USA.

4599511,1,B0058KGHX6,"I agree with the commenter Fuva:
""For instance, Hershberger refers to the apparently substantial participation of ""African"" elites in the slave trade as ""Africans"" ""selling their own people"". This reflects the all too common but grossly incorrect view of ""Africans"" as a monolith, and contradicts substantial evidence that ""African"" slave traders were capturing and trading other humans who were BLACK but not necessarily THEIR people (from their ""tribe"", etc.). Analysis of this phenomenon is seriously lacking in this documentary.""

This is true, during the colonial period in the United States, slaves were mostly either Native American or African. (Not enough has been done on Native American slavery, as Native Americans comprised up to 1/3 of all slaves in some cities. But this is another story). These slaves were for the most part obtained via trading, as in Native Americans would sell other Native Americans to Europeans and West Africans would sell other West Africans to Europeans. Most people are somewhat aware of this fact, but this part of history is always told in a very misleading and simplistic way.

Both Native Americans and Africans as wells as Romans, Greeks, individuals in the Bible and individuals in the Koran ""owned"" slaves. However, the type of slavery practiced by these groups was not at all like the brutal Chattel Slavery that was practiced in the Americas. After the discovery of the New World, the demand for labor was so intense that a very different form of slavery was practiced which was Chattel slavery. Where as not only was the slave property of their master, but the master owned the slave children and the children's future children. This was totally different from the slavery practiced in Africa and other parts of the old world. Throughout African history and outside of Africa you had slaves who became generals and held other high ranking positions. For example, The first emperor of the Mali empire was an ""enslaved"" African. Why he was technically a slave, he was the leader of his nation. This could have never happened in the Americas.

Additionally, in Olaudah Equiano's autobiography. He describes the difference between being a slave in West Africa and the Americas. He had two different ""owners"" in West Africa before arriving to the Americas. He stated that his situation became grim only when he got into the hands of Europeans.

Slaves in Africa were basically Prisoners of War from other rival tribes. No one sold their own people. During this time of history there was no concept of race to Africans and Native Americans. Everything was tribal. Tribes at war, would temporarily enslave P.O.W.'s or incorporate them fully into the family. However, this system took a dangerous turn once outsiders begin exploiting it.

It is not out of the ordinary for a slave documentary not to truly address the nature and characteristic of Africa's involvement of the slave trade. However, this documentary seemed to focus heavily on the ""evil African myth"". This myth is played out at the beginning and then forcefully ""crow-barred"" in a latter part of the film. This combined with overemphasizing the ""good master"", caused me not to take this film seriously and question the motive of the film-maker. I can now see why the price is only $4.99, and yet the film is relatively still new. Not only is the film slanted, but the re-enactments reminds of 1980's PBS.

If the point of the film was to showcase White sympathy during slavery, the filmmaker should have focused on the Underground Railroad, The Boston Vigilance Committee, etc... This film is a very incorrect interpretation of history and should not be used in any classroom.

4599512,3,B0058KGHX6,"The Blu-ray and the Dvd are now on one page so my review is showing up twice.

This documentary looks and feels similar to documentaries on slavery done by PBS such as,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slavery-and-the-Making-of-America/dp/B0007IOTJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slavery and the Making of America</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Africans-in-America-America-s-Journey-Through-Slavery/dp/B00004U2MR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Africans in America: America's Journey Through Slavery</a>.

The production level and the scene reenactments also seem on par with documentary seen on PBS. There is no profanity however it is rated TV-14.

There are no special features or extra scenes nor extra information added to this Blu-ray. One would think that the producers of this documentary would have used the extra storage space the blu-ray media offers in order to add the things that a lacking but they did not so you might want to consider the DVD version for under $5.00 instead of paying $15.00 for this Blu-ray.

The problem with this documentary is the content not the presentation.
In the first part of the documentary it talks about the slave trade from Africa. Rather than start at the beginning and give the viewers back ground history on slave trading in Africa such as, the Arab slave trade or that the trans-atlantic slave trade was started by the Portuguese and Spanish empires long before Slaves started coming to America, this documentary says African sold Africans into Slavery then it goes into how the slave were brought to America.

The slave trade was much more complicated than just Africans selling Africans. The documentary failed to mention that the Portuguese and European empires of the time were taking Africans into slavery by force and these Europeans met strong resistance from Africans fighting for their life/freedom. I understand that this is a documentary about slaves in America but not including the background history of slavery and just saying Africans sold Africans to the Europeans who were looking for labor gives off the feeling as if someone just picked up a history book and turned it into a documentary. This does an injustice to a person in search of knowledge on the subject.

Next the documentary jumps to the American colonies. Again rather than give the viewer important details of the first Africans in the Virginia colony the documentary makes it seem like the first Africans came here as slaves. When it talks about the Africans that were indentured servants and who were eventually freed the documentary makes it seem like they were still on some sought of reservation. The documentary fails to go into detail about Anthony Johnson who was one of the first free African. There are so many instances where the documentary is lacking I could go on and on. For anyone who has done research on this topic this dvd will leave u wondering about the intentions of the producer.

Although this documentary feels like it is the history of slavery from the slave masters point of view, it does have a lot of information on slavery that not too many people know about. I would recommend this dvd only if you plan on doing further research on the topic. If this it the only dvd you plan on buying about slavery then you will be doing yourself and other a disservice as there is a lot of information missing from it. If anyone wants to do further research on the subject, States like Virginia and Maryland have Historical archive with documents from slavery time that can be access for free online.

I would also recommend the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-SLAVE-TRADE-THE-STORY-OF-THE-ATLANTIC-SLAVE-TRADE-1440-1870/dp/0684835657/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The SLAVE TRADE: THE STORY OF THE ATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE: 1440 - 1870</a>

Here are just some facts that this documentary fails to mention:

The European slave trade in Africa or Chattel slavery started in 1441. In 1441 Anto Gonalves a captain for Prince Henry of Portugal captured an African on the west coast of Africa. Captain Nuno Tristo and captain Anto Gonalves forced their captive to tell them where his village was; they then raided the village and took ten Africans back to Portugal as slaves. For the next 6/7 years, Nuno Tristo and many others would raid and capture Africans and force them into slavery. The portugees ran into resistance and even Nuno Tristo himself was killed by African protecting their villages and in 1447 Prince Henry halted slave trade but in 1455 the trade started again. This took place almost 200 years before the first African would make it to America against his will.

Here is a quote from King Mvemba a Nzinga of the Kongo back in the 1500's just to show that this was much more than just African selling Africans.

""Each day the traders are kidnapping our people - children of this country, sons of our nobles and vassals, even people of our own family. This corruption and depravity are so widespread that our land is entirely depopulated. We need in this kingdom only priests and schoolteachers, and no merchandise, unless it is wine and flour for Mass. It is our wish that this Kingdom not be a place for the trade or transport of slaves."" Many of our subjects eagerly lust after Portuguese merchandise that your subjects have brought into our domains. To satisfy this inordinate appetite, they seize many of our black free subjects.... They sell them. After having taken these prisoners [to the coast] secretly or at night..... As soon as the captives are in the hands of white men they are branded with a red-hot iron""

Slavery is a very complicated subject because there were so many different parties involved and if someone is making a documentary on the subject he or she needs to at least give the viewer a better understanding of the trade of slaves not just saying Africans sold Africans into slavery.

Ask yourself this, Did the Africans sail to Europe and told the European they were selling Africans as slaves of did European come to Africa and take people into Slavery? Did the Africans build ports for slave trafficking or was it the Europeans? This issue is very complicated and it is very upsetting to see a documentary that just brushes over very important detail. Yes there were people from different nation that sold captives to Europeans but that does not account for all the millions of people taken nor can it be used to justify slavery. When talking about Africa people have the tendency to make Africa out to be one big nation instead of a continent with many nations on it. So instead of saying that Europeans gave guns to kingdom such as Benin to go out and conquer other nations, we get Africans captured Africans and sold them as slaves.

Here is a quote from Virginia Historical Society:

""A Dutch slave trader excanged his cargo of Africans for food in 1619. The Africans became indentured servants, similar in legal position to many poor Englishmen who traded several years labor in exchange for passage to America. The popular conception of a race-based slave system did not fully develop until the 1680's.""

But According to this dvd the first Africans in America were Slaves.

There is just so much more on slavery. what I have mentioned here is just a grain of sand. If you are really into this subject please do some more research about the things mentioned in this bluray.",1333843200,28,7508,5.135135135135135

I do not believe that there are any errors of fact in these 7 films, but if there were omissions, it was not an intention to hide anything, simply a matter of condensing so much history into a prescribed and artificial time parameter, the approximately 45 minute running time for each episode as is the industry norm.

4599517,3,B0058KGHX6,"""Up from Slavery"" consist of seven installments running about 42 minutes each. They cover distinct periods of slavery from the first black indentured servants brought to the Jamestown Colony in 1619 through the 13th Amendment ratified in 1865. But instead of making this history come alive, it merely comes across as a history textbook with visual aids.

I watched all five hours, and more than ninety percent of this is the narrator speaking...blah, blah, blah blah. The information is good, in fact, it is very good. But if you want to hold the viewers' attention--especially a classroom full of 16-year-old's like I teach--you need to liven things up a bit.

For example, in ""Part Four:  Nat Turner's Rebellion,"" why not use some other voice actors? Don't merely recreate scenes of Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner, use voice-overs to express these rebels' own words. Bring in some historians and scholars to offer their insights. Only rarely does someone other than the narrator speak. [And why did Part Four give no mention of David Walker?]

While I found this documentary interesting in terms of the information it provided, it gets low marks for presentation. I have a few other minor quibbles. Several times, the scene on camera did not relate to the topic being discussed. Also, there was one scene about the slave trade and the film footage looked like it was taken from a black-and-white movie from the Thirties. In Part Seven, the narrator was talking about the 13th amendment and the visual was color footage of the White House with tourists and cars driving by. And numerous times the same footage or still image was repeated throughout several of the episodes. It was little things like this that make me believe that this series was put together on a very low budget.

Again, this was a very informative documentary and it cost less than a dollar per hour; it just isn't going to sustain the viewers' attention hour after hour. Bottom line?  I certainly don't feel that I overpaid for this (I purchased it as a two-pack with ""Black History:  A Retrospective""), but I probably won't be showing it to my students. I'll stick with the PBS series ""Slavery and the Making of America"" instead.",1330646400,14,2217,4.864721485411141

Wanted to hear more about Nat Turner. But the biggest disappointment was, I believe, they should had included events leading to the Civil Rights Movement, with Martin Luther King and what is happening today.

4599524,5,B0058KGHX6,"I am of course biased, but there was great care taken in the writing of this documentary, and in the shooting of the original recreations for the film series. Care was also taken to give a balanced portrayal of events -- highlighting the more far-reaching and important events that either represented slavery on the whole or affected later history in their importance -- but condensing nearly 400 years of history into a few hours would be a difficult task for anyone taking on that challenge.  I do not believe that there are any errors of fact in these 7 films, but if there were omissions, it was not an intention to hide anything, simply a matter of condensing so much history into a prescribed and artificial time parameter, the approximately 45 minute running time for each episode as is the industry norm.  I believe strongly that this series, at such a fantastic price, is ideal for educators and students of all levels and appropriate for all ages.",1328140800,14,957,4.724550898203593
4599525,2,B0058KGHX6,"Here, Hershberger provides a decent historical overview of the black experience in America thru the Civil War, chock full of interesting, important and under-known details. However the documentary falters in its over- and under-playing of certain phenomena, and in its advancement of disputable ""facts"".

For instance, Hershberger refers to the apparently substantial participation of ""African"" elites in the slave trade as ""Africans"" ""selling their own people"". This reflects the all too common but grossly incorrect view of ""Africans"" as a monolith, and contradicts substantial evidence that ""African"" slave traders were capturing and trading other humans who were BLACK, but not necessarily THEIR people (from their ""tribe"", etc.). Analysis of this phenomenon is seriously lacking in this documentary.

Hershberger also seems to overplay certain phenomena -- e.g., the ""good master"" -- thereby distorting their significance. Also, there's almost no analysis of the intergenerational and persistent mental, physical and socioeconomic trauma the centuries of brutality and terror have had on black people.

These shortcomings may or may not be attributable to ""Eurocentric"" perspective. And, to be fair, no documentary of so large and complex a topic will be perfect. Nevertheless, I wonder if it underscores the need for more black historians and documentarians to be doing this kind of work.

UPDATE: I reduced my rating to two stars. Since purchasing this DVD, I've become even more convinced of the need for a full, true accounting of American history. For the sake of us ALL. This documentary unfortunately falls shorts.",1325376000,189,1626,5.57085020242915

4599527,3,B0058KGHX6,"What you get for $4 dollars is a documentary that looks and feels similar to documentaries on slavery done by PBS such as,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slavery-and-the-Making-of-America/dp/B0007IOTJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slavery and the Making of America</a>&nbsp;and Africans in America: America's Journey Through Slavery.

The production level and the scene reenactments also seem on par with documentary seen on PBS.There is no profanity however it is rated as TV-14.

The problem with this documentary is the content not the presentation.
In the first part of the documentary it talks about the slave trade from Africa. Rather than start at the beginning and give the viewers back ground history on slave trading in Africa such as, the Arab slave trade or that the trans-atlantic slave trade was started by the Portuguese and Spanish empires long before Slaves started coming to America, this documentary says African sold Africans into Slavery then it goes into how the slave were brought to America.

The slave trade was much more complicated than just Africans selling Africans. The documentary failed to mention that the Portuguese and European empires of the time were taking Africans into slavery by force and these Europeans met strong resistance from Africans fighting for their life/freedom. I understand that this is a documentary about slaves in America but not including the background history of slavery and just saying Africans sold Africans to the Europeans who were looking for labor gives off the feeling as if someone just picked up a history book and turned it into a documentary. This does an injustice to a person in search of knowledge on the subject.

Next the documentary jumps to the American colonies. Again rather than give the viewer important details of the first Africans in the Virginia colony the documentary makes it seem like the first Africans came here as slaves. When it talks about the Africans that were indentured servants and who were eventually freed the documentary makes it seem like they were still on some sought of reservation. The documentary fails to go into detail about Anthony Johnson who was one of the first free African. There are so many instances where the documentary is lacking I could go on and on. For anyone who has done research on this topic this dvd will leave u wondering about the intentions of the producer.

Although this documentary feels like it is the history of slavery from the slave masters point of view, it does have a lot of information on slavery that not too many people know about. For $4 dollars you really can't go wrong. I would recommend this dvd only if you plan on doing further research on the topic. If this it the only dvd you plan on buying about slavery then you will be doing yourself and other a disservice as there is a lot of information missing from it. If anyone wants to do further research on the subject, States like Virginia and Maryland have Historical archive with documents from slavery time that can be access for free online.

I would also recommend the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-SLAVE-TRADE-THE-STORY-OF-THE-ATLANTIC-SLAVE-TRADE-1440-1870/dp/0684835657/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The SLAVE TRADE: THE STORY OF THE ATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE: 1440 - 1870</a>

Here are just some facts that this documentary fails to mention:

The European slave trade in Africa or Chattel slavery started in 1441. In 1441 Anto Gonalves a captain for Prince Henry of Portugal captured an African on the west coast of Africa. Captain Nuno Tristo and captain Anto Gonalves forced their captive to tell them where his village was; they then raided the village and took ten Africans back to Portugal as slaves. For the next 6/7 years, Nuno Tristo and many others would raid and capture Africans and force them into slavery. The portugees ran into resistance and even Nuno Tristo himself was killed by African protecting their villages and in 1447 Prince Henry halted slave trade but in 1455 the trade started again. This took place almost 200 years before the first African would make it to America against his will.

Here is a quote from King Mvemba a Nzinga of the Kongo back in the 1500's just to show that this was much more than just African selling Africans.

""Each day the traders are kidnapping our people - children of this country, sons of our nobles and vassals, even people of our own family. This corruption and depravity are so widespread that our land is entirely depopulated. We need in this kingdom only priests and schoolteachers, and no merchandise, unless it is wine and flour for Mass. It is our wish that this Kingdom not be a place for the trade or transport of slaves."" Many of our subjects eagerly lust after Portuguese merchandise that your subjects have brought into our domains. To satisfy this inordinate appetite, they seize many of our black free subjects.... They sell them. After having taken these prisoners [to the coast] secretly or at night..... As soon as the captives are in the hands of white men they are branded with a red-hot iron""

Slavery is a very complicated subject because there were so many different parties involved and if someone is making a documentary on the subject he or she needs to at least give the viewer a better understanding of the trade of slaves not just saying Africans sold Africans into slavery.

Ask yourself this, Did the Africans sail to Europe and told the European they were selling Africans as slaves of did European come to Africa and take people into Slavery? Did the Africans build ports for slave trafficking or was it the Europeans?  This issue is very complicated and it is very upsetting to see a documentary that just brushes over very important detail. Yes there were people from different nation that sold captives to Europeans but that does not account for all the millions of people taken nor can it be used to justify slavery. When talking about Africa people have the tendency to make Africa out to be one big nation instead of a continent with many nations on it. So instead of saying that Europeans gave guns to kingdom such as Benin to go out and conquer other nations, we get Africans captured Africans and sold them as slaves.

Here is a quote from Virginia Historical Society:

 ""A Dutch slave trader excanged his cargo of Africans for food in 1619. The Africans became indentured servants, similar in legal position to many poor Englishmen who traded several years labor in exchange for passage to America. The popular conception of a race-based slave system did not fully develop until the 1680's.""

But According to this dvd the first Africans in America were Slaves.

There is just so much more on slavery. what I have mentioned here is just a grain of sand. If you are really into this subject please do some more research about the things mentioned in this dvd.",1324252800,108,6955,5.027801911381408
4599528,1,B0058KGHX6,"I bought this from Target; wish I Never saw it. I thought it would be interesting study. But if you want a quick breakdown its nothing more than ""Foxy Liberal Indoctrination"". First DVD focused not on the Slaves story..but entirely on the White Abolitionist that helped the ""poor black Negroe""..and they strongly suggest if not for these ""good white folk"" the argument of ending slavery and the civil war never would have occured. Disgusted by the lies and ommitted stories of Black Bravery, Intelligence, and Sacrifice. I moved to DVD #2 and looked up Nat Turner. Unsurprisingly they Immediately focus on ""White Retribution"" for the revolts and repeatedly mentioned the ghastly slaughter of innocents and ""FreeMen"", comparing number of Whites killed to Blacks...to add insult they described most of the revolters hiding in the bushes in ""Terror"" and described one white man boasting to have killed 10-15 Blacks ""by himself""..sure. On the subject of Denmark Vessey, they Stereotyped him as a Musclebound brute who went crazy..in fact he was a Business Owner, Well-off Free and held in high regard by White Society..the equivalent of Colonel Collin Powell in Intelligence, Ability and Leadership. They also conveniently left out had it not been for a Black ""snitch"" the white Elites of Charleston were hours from meeting their doom and History would have been altered.
