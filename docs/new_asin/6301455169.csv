330627,5,6301455169,"This 2 disc (4 side) compilation features the very first 16 episodes broadcast in 1949 (out of some 187 episodes total, 1949-57), plus ""Message to Abe,"" a 1957 episode. This fact is not noted on the packaging. The episodes are presented in sequence. Though video quality varies from episode to episode, overall it
is quite good, certainly comparable to one's 1950-vintage TV set. The sound, ""digitally remastered in virtual 5.1,"" is quite OK. This is in black-and-white, not color. There are no extra features. Oh, The Lone Ranger gallops around landscape that is  Californian, southern California or the Sierran foothills. At 7 hours, 34 minutes for the 17 shows, this is good value for the money. Happy memories, and ""Hi-yo Silver!""",1070409600,10,734,5.066115702479339

Buena imagen, sonido y por supuesto historia que muestra que el bien siempre debe triunfar sobre el mal, sin que el hroe tenga que matar a los malos. Lamento que esta serie (y ninguna del mismo personaje hasta donde yo se) no tenga subttulos en espaol. Cundo se le ocurrir a alguien producir esta serie y otras ms pensando en el pblico de habla hispana?",1316649600,,490,4.51685393258427
