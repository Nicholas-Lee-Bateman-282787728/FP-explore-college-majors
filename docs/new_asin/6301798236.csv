7815866,5,6301798236,It is a great old movie and brought back a lot of memories from that era. Raquel Welch is always fun to watch. What a comedy.,1363910400,,125,3.8461538461538463
7815867,4,6301798236,"I have always thought Ms Welsh was an underrated, underused actress and this small gem of a film with Bill Cosby is the main piece of evidence of my thesis. While its a true product of the 70's, its humor and charm still seems ring thru. I just wish they would make it into a DVD. She should also be seen in The 3 Musketeers.",1119571200,,325,4.015384615384615
7815868,5,6301798236,"I could spend countless words proclaiming the greatness of this film as one of the great urban street comedies of the 70's but just watch the film and it will speak for itself.
I do want to mention that the director of this cinematic gem also directed a little number called ""Krull"" which is to high fantasy what ""Mother, Jugs, and Speed"" is to the world of high-brow comedy.
Plus it gave us Lysette Anthony.",1057622400,,408,4.453333333333333
7815869,3,6301798236,"I'm a big fan of ""Bullitt,"" but I like this movie a lot too. Just listen to the Brothers Johnson singing in the background, along with Peter Frampton, and other classic singers, and you've gone in a time machine back to the simple, laid-back '70s. This is the story of a group of ambulance drivers, and wild adventures they run into with each call. The cast is terrific, a very good ensemble. Raquel Welch is gorgeous(as always.) Plus, Bill Cosby and Larry Hagman in the same film! That alone is worth looking at... especially if you're an '80s buff like me. Who knew at the time these two would go on to star in two of the biggest shows of the decade- ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Dallas"" respectively. Also starring Harvey Keitel and Bruce Davison. I've liked this movie since was a kid, and it's still lots of fun to watch now. Very good entertainment!",1028246400,,848,4.47741935483871
7815870,4,6301798236,"A very interesting look at a rag-tag bunch of ambulance drivers/paramedics. Great roles for Cosby, Keitel and Welch(to some degree). I really like Bruce Davison in it too. The most interesting thing is how the movie is really funny in parts, but then it takes some serious turns. I remember reading a qoute from Quentin Tarantino about how he was a fan of this. He talked about how cool it is when a movie has you laughing and laughing, and then you're not laughing(like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown). This really is a great little film from a good director-Peter Yates-who brought you such classics as BREAKING AWAY and BULLIT. Cosby is really an interesting movie actor, and if you like him here, I have to highly suggest that you try to see HICKEY AND BOGGS-starring Cosby and Robert Culp(written by Walter Hill). Tarantino also mention HICKEY AND BOGGS-it was one of the films he screened before making JACKIE BROWN. Anyway-just watch MOTHER, JUGS darnit!",999561600,3,976,4.850299401197605
7815871,5,6301798236,"Mother, Jugs and Speed accurately depicts life of 1970s era  Paramedics and Emergency Medical Technicians.  With the addition of Bill Cosby's humor  and the ""look"" of Rachel Welch, this movie is well worth  watching.",966643200,,216,5.264705882352941
7815872,4,6301798236,"this Film really tripped me out.you will never look at an ambulance the same again. Bill Cosby,Raquel Welch(What a Sexy Lady)are funny through out  this film. Larry JR.Hagman is a Trip. Harvey Keitel does really well here.i  never get tired of this film.",965779200,,254,4.883720930232558
7815873,3,6301798236,"Pretty much what you would expect, given the plot--two competing ambulance services chase around the city for patients and profits; the wacky stuff, like occupied gurneys rolling free down city streets and scaring nuns at  crosswalks alternates with the mercifully brief meditative stuff--shortly  after giving his ""There's more to life than this"" speech to  fellow EMT Bill Cosby, Bruce Davison gets blown away by a junkie who wants  drugs from their rig.  Raquel Welch moves her way up from harassed office  secretary (everyone at the station calls her ""Jugs"", nice, huh?)  to EMT, but loses her first patient--bummer!  Harvey Keitel is Raquel's  love interest (rare that the man gets subordinated in that way), and Cosby  underplays nicely as the most professional of the group.  Allen Garfield  does his usual sleazebag routine as the put-upon head of the operation.  Funny in spots--evocative of the time period.  Really stretches the  ""PG"" rating--the board must've been in a giving mood--lots of  rough language, drug and alcohol use, and yes, Larry Hagman's character at  least TRIES to have sex with an OD patient in the back of his vehicle.  Raquel, though, ""comes through"" under a sheet (a lot happens in  the back of those vans!)  Can't give an ""expert"" review--I'm a  librarian!",946425600,2,1291,5.110576923076923
