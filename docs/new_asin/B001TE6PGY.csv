3789254,2,B001TE6PGY,I am very disappointed in Amazon.  There are suppose to be four movies on this DVD but I have only two...Diamond Girl and Loving Evangeline.  When I tried to leave customer feedback for the seller it wouldn't allow me.  Diamond Girl wasn't bad but LE left alot to be desired...I love Linda Howard and have read all her books but this adaption was a total waste.  So if anyone from Amazon bothers to read this review...I would like to know how to get a correct copy of the DVD since I can even leave you feedback.,1289520000,11,512,4.302083333333333
3789255,4,B001TE6PGY,"Who likes to read romance novels like me, will love this movies.
Watch it by yourself or with your spouse on a nice cold day snuggled up on the couch.
If you feel a little bit sad, romances always lift up my spirit again.",1288828800,9,221,4.045454545454546
3789256,4,B001TE6PGY,"Diamond Girl A

This is such an indulgent movie for cheesy romance lovers. There is nothing of substance in it, but if you want an hour and a half of pure trashy fun then this is it. Of course the production isn't all that good the acting is at best ok and the lines aren't great, but it doesn;t detract at all from the goey goodness. It's just good cheap fun.

The Awakening A

The best of the movies IMO, same pretty much as above but I felt that the acting was better and the characters were better. I haven't read the book this was based on so I don;t know how it relates.

At the Midnight Hour C

Ok, not really memoriable or worth watching over and over. Where the over the top characters from Diamond Girl don't take away from the movie, but rather make it feel more indulgent I had a harder time warming up to these characters.

Loving Evangeline F

If you haven't seen it save your eyes and don't, if you buy the set do yourself a favor take a key and ruin the side that this movie is on.

Book to movie I have only read Diamon Girl by Diana Palmer and Loving Evangeline by Linda Howard, DG is nowhere near the movie, but both work in their own right. LE is even less like hte book, and the hero casting and written is so different from anything resembling s LH hero that it really messed my up, Robert in the movie is a nerd.",1279411200,13,1335,4.088122605363985

3789265,4,B001TE6PGY,"I enjoyed this dvd, especially ""Diamond Girl"". I've already watched it a dozen times. The stories are a bit corny, but there's no violence, blood shed or explicit sex. I just enjoy a clean, no swearing,  romantic story with a happy ending. That's my idea of romance in a film. Wish they'd bring back Harlequin Romances  to tv.",1444435200,,326,4.603448275862069

3789282,5,B001TE6PGY,I owned all 3 versions of Harlequin Collector's sets. They are older romance movies but I do enjoy them. Worth the money,1391731200,,120,4.5
3789283,4,B001TE6PGY,They were what I expected. I was pleasantly surprised at the acting because I was afraid that I expected too much. They were typical Harlequin stories without having to read them. The stories contained little sex and foul language which was a pleasant surprise also.,1386028800,,266,4.933333333333334
3789284,5,B001TE6PGY,I enjoyed watching all four features of the Harlequin Movies. I look forward in buying more of Harlequin features to buy.,1379635200,,121,4.809523809523809

3789288,5,B001TE6PGY,"Lots of time the TV doesn't have anything good on and aren't you all just sick of movie remakes???  We are!!!  The movie makers need to make more great and entertaining movies these days.  Wonder if the only good writers worked on 24 and now moved over to the Revenge series.  Anyway, when all gets boring, these movies proved to be great little entertainers.  I will definitely be buying more of these and other movie series as a filler for the so many frequent boring TV times.  We even have Direct TV and they seem to prefer showing movies that are old, or those boring Drama's that have even more boring endings.  We have really enjoyed these movies and Dyan Cannon is a great actress.  If you haven't added Master's Of The Game with Cannon, do so, it is a great one.  Woman of Substance was a nice entertaining series also with Bosley.  Okay, I've yammered enough.  Enjoy these, we have.",1361059200,,892,4.478260869565218

3789290,5,B001TE6PGY,"These movies are remarkably good. One didn't pair the love interest couple well, the girl who fell for the private detective looked awfully young even when they did a makeover she looked 16 years old, but other than that the stories were good and worth watching. Great price too!",1342915200,,279,4.714285714285714
3789291,4,B001TE6PGY,The Harlequin movies are all very good. I enjoy watching them. They are a bit sappy but very good entertainment value for the money!!,1342569600,,133,4.583333333333333
3789292,5,B001TE6PGY,"I enjoy watching Harlequin romance movies because they are PG rated and don't have ""hard core"" sex scenes or profanity.  These four movies are not boring or ""old fashioned,"" just good taste and it's refreshing to not be distracted by profanity and the love scenes leave something to the imagination.  They are modern stories and the mysteries keep you on the edge of your seat.",1326585600,,377,4.7846153846153845
3789293,2,B001TE6PGY,"I'm extremely disappointed in this DVD. It's a collection of 4 movies of which I wanted only 1 but figured the price was right. Upon arrival there was only one DVD in the sealed DVD box and it did not include the one movie that I had originally wanted. I purchased two other of these 4-film collector's sets and they both came with two DVD, just this one was missing a second DVD. I've not investigated as to whether Amazon will send a replacement, but this shouldn't happen.",1295740800,5,475,4.409090909090909
3789294,1,B001TE6PGY,"First of all,  there was only 2 movies on this disk, instead of the 4 they list.  Second the quality of the picture was sub-standard.

3789295,2,B001TE6PGY,i didn't receive the whole volume and the return was good but not the replacement i still didn't receive all the movies.,1289952000,4,120,4.5
3789296,1,B001TE6PGY,"I waited a whole week in anticipation for the weekend when I would get all four of these movies. I truly only wanted one movie of the four but I was willing to get all four. When the package came in the mail I raced to my room and opened the DVD box. Ripping it open with the zeal of a child at Christmas I only saw one DVD. I thought it was strange but I put the DVD in my player.
  When The screen lit up there was only one movie on side A. I felt a sick feeling so I turned it over and found there was only one movie on side B as well. I am MISSING a whole DVD in a package that should not have been opened. I am MISSING the movie that I wanted to see. It wouldn't have been so bad it the DVD that I revieved had the movie on it that I wanted in the first place.
  Ok, yes I would have been a bit perturbed that I was missing the other DVD in the box but I would have the movie I wanted originally. But no. That wasn't the case at all. I went to the returns site and reported it but it will take another week for my movies to come to exchange it and I'm not guaranteed that both DVDs will be in the box this time either.",1289606400,10,1123,3.6666666666666665
