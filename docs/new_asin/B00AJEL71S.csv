5440233,5,B00AJEL71S,"This film is one of the most incredible, beautiful, and heart wrenching works of art I have ever seen. Whether you're into anime or not, anybody should be able to appreciate this fantastic movie. This is a story about love, and familial bonds, and just how strong those forces can be. Don't watch if you aren't prepared to cry like a baby. The animation is stunning. It has that kind of older, hand-drawn feel that we saw a lot of in the 90s, with the high definition that can only come with more recent projects. The soundtrack is fantastic, giving feelings of both elation and devastation when appropriate. The Japanese voice cast is great, and while I can't as of yet speak for the English dub, I will be editing this review with my thoughts on that, as well as the box set itself and the features, when the product is actually released.

A final note that I want to drive home. In a time when piracy is at an all time high, it has become extremely important to support official releases, especially in the American anime market, which in particular suffers from the perils of the information age. So please, don't just stream this online and not bother to support the company. This isn't to say don't watch it online at all, but if you do, and you enjoy it (and I don't see how you couldn't) please be sure to purchase the official release.",1377216000,318,1344,4.463414634146342
5440234,5,B00AJEL71S,"This is an extraordinary film:  gorgeously animated, a flawless mix of computer graphics and hand-drawn images, funny, surprising, and touching without being maudlin.  It is very much a film for parents, both a literal fantasy, and an allegory about the challenges and rewards of raising your children.  It's very hard to find anything bad to say about it.  I presume it will be distributed in the US at some point, but is worth some impatience if you are a fan of the director's previous work (and have a region-free DVD player or BluRay).  I enjoyed The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, but Wolf Children beats it hands down.

We were privileged to see this film in the New People theater in San Francisco, as part of the Japanese Film Festival, so we got superb visuals and sound quality, and an environment allowing the film to receive our full attention.",1375833600,3,855,4.704697986577181
5440235,5,B00AJEL71S,"The director of ""Summer Wars,"" and ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,"" has done it again with another masterpiece in story telling.  Mamoru Hosoda creates a world within our own, much like in his previous movies, and builds drama through character driven story.  It is amazing how much you truly care for these children and their bad-luck-stricken mother just minutes into the film.  Hosoda reaches into his bag of tricks and provides many scenes that create those slice of life moments that make you happy to be a human and mix it with the very real danger of losing your children.  I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.
Beyond the obvious and more into the structure of the movie I would say that this film's breathtaking and dramatic moments are only rivaled by its amazing tempo and screenplay.  Tempo can change a movie from action to feel good in moments and this movie does a great job with that.  If I were to tell you that this movie doesn't lack in the montage department you might be turned off immediately but I dare you to watch the segments of the film and think anything other than genius.  There were moments when I felt that the story was on autopilot, mostly because of a montage changing the time frame, only to be stopped dead in my tracks with tragedy, horror, or a feel good moment.  The films pace never slows or speeds up and that is a groundbreaking achievement to keep the interest of your audience with such a technique (Watch any Christopher Nolan film and you will know what I am talking about. Tempo never changes in his films and it works masterfully).
Finally I will say that one day this film will make it into the American market and some actors will dub over the voices with their in-equivalent ability and ruin the movie.  Watch this in Japanese with the subtitles, you will not be disappointed.  If you are thinking to yourself,  ""who would ever want to read that much,"" remember you have probably been reading for almost two decades or more and it shouldn't be considered a chore.",1367452800,5,2026,4.569060773480663
5440236,5,B00AJEL71S,I saw this recently and thought it was going to be something completely different than it was. I got an amazing film about the things that define us as human. And finding out who and what you are. The kids/cubs are way too cute.  This is a wonderful family film that will make you appreciate your mother that much more. Watch with kids/parents. Then give them a hug.,1365292800,5,366,4.382352941176471

5440238,2,B00AJEL71S,"The Blu-ray case arrived strangely damaged, as though it had been left in extreme heat for a long timesee the picture. It gives a wrinkled appearance to the entire case. It was also shrink wrapped in low quality shrink wrap, making me wonder whether this is legitimate. However, the included digital code worked fine, and the discs are perfect. Its such a shame to pay more for a Collectors Edition, only to receive a damaged product. Pretty unhappy.",1527120000,,450,4.782051282051282

5440256,5,B00AJEL71S,"Honestly one of the best movies I've ever seen. Not just anime, but all movies. It's such an emotional trip, from smiling ear to ear to crying your heart out in a pillow, or even both at the same time. I wish I was exaggerating, but I haven't cried like that in years, haha. I just had to own a physical copy. I admit, it may not connect to everyone in the same way that it connects to me, but it has a special place in my heart now.",1521244800,,433,3.8764044943820224

She requests it frequently.",1520121600,,324,4.209677419354839
5440260,5,B00AJEL71S,"This movie was great!  I really liked the story because it shows the audience the challenges of being a parent and making sacrifices. We also see life from the kids' perspective as well, with Yuki (daughter) being the narrator.  I thought it was easy to relate to because every kid wants a sense of belonging, and when they grow up, they try to figure out who they want to be and what they want to do in the future. Overall, this was an excellent family-oriented film that everyone should watch.",1520035200,,495,4.488888888888889

5440277,3,B00AJEL71S,I thought this would be like Ponyo and Totoro but it's not-it's very slow and dramatic-too serious for my kids-my 7 year old cried. She likes it but I wish I'd watched it first.

5440314,5,B00AJEL71S,"an amazing movie with stunning scenery plus the animation of the characters changing between wolf pups and children was really cute really touched my heart
Hana was a student before she was a mother. She was bright and pretty, and her future held endless possibilities. Then she met a man, who turned out to be a wolf, and together they built a family. Hana loved her mate fiercely, but fate took him from her, leaving her alone with two unusual kids she didn't know how to raise. Frightened of being discovered, Hana and her wolf children fled to the countryside to build a new life. Raising her little wild things was an adventure. It left Hana bruised, scratched, exhausted, and joyously overwhelmed as her pups grew stronger and wandered further every day. This is a mothers journey. Teach your children to chase their dreams  and smile through the tears as they disappear into the world in search of who they will become. Hana wasn't always a mother, but it was always what she was meant to be.",1507593600,,999,4.6440677966101696

It's almost more of a slice of life presentation that covers some of the touching and ""realistic"" challenges the family faces as their lives progress. Very reflective and emotional at times. I sincerely appreciated the depth of the character design and events as they unfold. We laughed and cried many times. The visual and sound quality is as good as it gets for an animated film.

5440361,5,B00AJEL71S,"This arrived in a timely manner, and what was delivered is a heart-felt, simple story with a supernatural premise. Werewolves exist, but past that, it's incredibly focused and intimate upon the family involved. There are no outside forces or conflicts with which to contend except for the challenges of single parenthood and a dualistic nature in the children. I felt like, after watching this, I understand a lot more about parenting as an experience despite how many times I've seen it depicted before. I'm not one who commonly cries when watching movies, but this one brought tears to my eyes. I'm not in a rush to watch it again because I don't like crying, but it's an emotionally gripping experience that's worth your time.",1496793600,2,729,4.887096774193548

Heartwarming, heartwrenchingly sad, and emotionally moving, Wolf Children's themes involve the challenges of becoming a single parent, and the lesson to push our children to chase their dreams; the constant need to protect them from the world, the fear of losing something dear to you, and the difficult lesson of knowing to let go and let them spread their wings and find their own place in the world.

A wonderful film about the power of a Mother's love for her children, and the path of parenthood, and finding one's own path. ""Wolf Children"" is a film that deserves a spot in any animation and film collection.",1494979200,,922,4.75625

5440380,5,B00AJEL71S,"First off I LOVED this movie. But I would not  necessary recommend it for small children. This movie shows real life beautifully, even in tragedy. I'll try not to spoil the movie, but here is what might not be appropriate for very young viewers:

Love scene: it is obvious a couple is about to have sex but all that is shown is from the shoulders up of them talking, a kiss and them leaning out of the screen.

Death: A character dies and the body is shown up close. No gore but a traumatic scene that could give small vewers nightmares especially if they understand what's going on.

Nipple: A nipple is exposed briefly wile a mother is feeding her baby. If you don't want your children knowing that is how most babies eat and that's how they grow then this isn't for you.

Nudity: There are a few scenes where the kids are nude. They are innocent scenes of the children and no genitalia are shown. Most if not all are scenes are shown from the back or stomach up.

Circle of life: You see a few dead animals in the movie in the mouth of another animal about to be eaten. There is no gore, but a parent not ready to explain this to their children yet or a sensitive child might have a hard time with it.

 This being said I still love the movie and it is very beautiful but I wouldn't necessarily deem it a PG movie.",1490659200,,1317,4.198412698412699

5440407,5,B00AJEL71S,"I am not a huge fan of anime except for the works of Hayao Miyazaki.  However, my 13-year-old daughter started taking an interest in anime a few years ago as she evolved her drawing style into more Japanese-stylistic direction.  I like to make sure what she is watching is appropriate, so I have increased my intake of Anime alongside her.  When her mother shared the trailer for ""Wolf Children"" on Facebook, I was immediately impressed with it.  I found so many similarities in style with Hayao Miyazaki's work, and the artistic detail into the animated scenery and characters drew me in.  I immediately bought the movie on Amazon without hesitation so I can view it with my daughter.  We loved it!  ""Wolf Children"" combines humor, drama, and fantasy elements to craft a heartfelt told story of love, dedication, and the struggles of raising two children as a single mother.  This movie serves as a real life metaphor of parenthood.  Raising two children with special abilities as they both head in opposite directions of their nature drew me in to the emotional journey of the mother.  There really is not enough words I can use to describe this film.  The scenery was beautiful particularly the mountain scenes.  Highly recommend this movie!",1484697600,2,1244,4.871428571428571

Although i'll warn you there are two ish awkward scenes if your watching it with sticklers or children unfamiliar with anime 1- the main characters tit is shown briefly when breastfeeding, 2- the main character is seen beginning to make out with the wolf man in his wolf form(she was already in love with him before she knew he was a wolf-man but it still may be awkward to some people), the scene ends and then you see them waking up together naked but no privates are shown.

5440470,5,B00AJEL71S,"I'd like to see more movies with unconventional love stories.  I'm not advocating bestiality or zoophilia by any means but it can work without coming off as creepy if given the chance and the right writer. We have heard about the kitsune legends of Japanese folklore about marrying humans....The story behind Wolf Children is nothing new by any means.  Instead of the woman being the non-human it's a man who happens to be a wolf that can change into human form....and, given the title of this movie, you guess that they bump uglies and had two kids that happen to be wolves

The father dies leaving behind Hana and her two children.  This is all about family ties despite an accident of birth.  Hana just tries to figure out how to live with rather special children

It will speak to the heart of anyone who feels born of two different cultures or identities and the life-long challenge of reconciling those two.  If not w/in yourself then w/ those and the world around you.  At the same time, the film will wrench out of your familiar, routine life and challenge you to leave it all for a true, *real* life in which heartbreak, turmoil, and difficulty are experienced together with the imperative for physical survival; all overcome to attain a full, abundant, meaningful life.  Experience it as both child and parent.  What a film.",1469318400,,605,4.892156862745098

We have the whole ghibli collection and have been branching out but it's tough making sure they are somewhat appropriate for a five year old. (Princess mononoke is currently her favorite but I'm scolded constantly because of the violence). Searching up child friendly films I came across this and it did not dissapoint. This was phenomenal and as a single parent I appreciated a glance into showing the work and love a mother puts in, with a twist of fantasy and magic.",1468108800,,587,4.70873786407767
5440486,5,B00AJEL71S,"The magical wolf-child premise is almost easy to forget when watching this. Really, it's a single mother doing the best she can, nearly broke, with children not like others - she stands for many women in the same kind of state. Seeing each child grow up, with so much about them she could guide but not control, seeing each find their own way, going off to live their own lives, it makes me think of any parent anywhere.

Then, the beautiful animation added life to the story. It was as good as any around these days, and given the generally high standards, that's a compliment. Some of the side characters didn't add much, like that gruff neighbor who probably made their rural life possible. He might have been over-drawn. But nits like that don't detract from a lovely, loving, and memorable movie.

5440497,5,B00AJEL71S,"This film should be shared between parents and children. It is a beautiful depiction of all forms of love, of loss, of moving on, of letting go, and putting forth your best effort in life. The story does deal with humans who are also wolves, which can turn off people not interested in fantasy, but I believe that everyone can learn from and enjoy this story. How do children find their ways in life and how do their parents and siblings impact their choices? How does someone learn to be a parent and how do they change when they become a single parent? How do children and parents learn to let each other go, how do you know when it is time? Wolf children explores all of these questions and more.

The characters are memorable and unique. Each family member is an individual and develops in a way that feels natural. Even the secondary characters have their own quirks that make them stand out and connect you to them. I loved the way the characters interacted with each other and how those interactions effected each character's actions and thoughts. The second half of the film moves a bit more quickly than the first half, but they were equally as good.

Even if you are not interested in the story, the animation alone makes it worth a watch. The scenery is stunning and the movements of the characters flows beautifully. There is a scene on a snow covered mountain that takes my breath away each time.",1466035200,2,1409,4.52156862745098

It felt like watching a Japanese re imagining of Twilight.  Average girl finds brooding, attractive man.  No one can possibly understand his plight!  But, of course, she does!  I even tried to keep an open mind about the whole ""making babies while he was in wolf-form"" thing, but I just couldn't help cringing. It was one painfully long melodramatic, snorefest.  As a parent, I'm usually very easily moved by any depiction of parental struggle and success.

5440548,5,B00AJEL71S,"I discovered Wolf Children when it was new (and only available in Japanese at the time), and I was pretty much just discovering anime. The film hooked me from the start with its storytelling, attention to detail, and beautiful, soothing music. I've seen most of the Disney movies, a lot of the other animation studios' films, and even a few Miyazaki/Ghibli movies. But this film is on a whole other level.

This is the story of a single mother raising two special needs children on her own, at first in a small apartment, and then out in the country in a run-down, fixer-upper home, when city life proves impossible. The special needs is that, when they get emotional, they transform into wolves, and act like puppies. It's very cute, but it is a burden and she handles it well. The problem is, one child wants to live as a human, and the other wants to live as a wolf. So their mother has to do right for each child's needs.

After seeing it several times in both Japanese, and later English (it's a new recording, it isn't dubbed over the Japanese audio), it's easy to say that it is the best animated film I've ever seen, and I have seen quite a few of them. But it is also one of the best films in any medium that I have seen. While I recommend it to everyone, the best way to watch it is with a mother, whether it's your mother, your sister, your wife, or another mother you know. It's hard to put into words, especially as a man, the gratitude we have for mothers, but to show them this film, and share with them this story, is to go a long way towards that. And while it isn't a tragedy  it's no Grave of the Fireflies by any means  you may want to have some tissues handy. When the credits hit, I could have used some. And definitely stay for the credits. Great song, great little recap of the film.

Side note: I actually do not own a Blu-ray player. I bought this for the DVD and for this to be my first Blu-ray when I finally get a Blu-ray player. Aside from the original Star Wars trilogy, I can't think of a better ""first Blu-ray"" to have.",1459900800,3,2052,4.251282051282051

It is a fairly simple story, a mother trying to raise two children who are part wolf, but you really feel for the mother and the kids throughout it. It's more like Pixar than Miyazaki, in focus on the story at least, as the movie is about the mother trying her best for her children.

5440596,5,B00AJEL71S,"It's tricky to explain how I came across this movie. I suppose it's because I was actually originally searching for some Hayao Miyazaki films that I had yet to see. But while browsing the web, this title kept popping up in the searches. The premise sounded interesting enough, but it wasn't until I saw some of my friends posting screencaps from it on their blogs that I finally decided to sit down and give it a watch. Clearly, there was something about this movie that people liked.

I'm so glad that I gave it a chance. Half coming-of-age tale and half fairy tale, this is a beautiful film that'll stay with you long after the credits roll.

Hana is a smart and hard working university student, who meets an aloof, but kind man...who also turns out to be half wolf (the man goes unnamed and is known only as ""father""). The kind and understanding Hana falls in love with him, and together, the couple has two children--a daughter, Yuki, and her little brother, Ame. But one day, tragedy strikes when Hana's husband is killed in an accident. On her own, and with no one to turn to, Hana moves to the countryside to start a new life and raise her kids--kids who are constantly changing back and forth between their human and wolf forms. As the years go by, the small family must overcome many challenges, from growing crops, to making new friends, to finding a job to make ends meet...all while trying to keep their dual natures a secret. But it's hard to live with one foot in both worlds, and pretty soon, as Yuki and Ame come of age, they'll have to make a choice of whether to remain as humans, or live in the wild as wolves.

By all accounts, this IS a fairy tale, but if you're expecting a lot of intense magic and fantasy battles, look elsewhere. The only real mystical element in this is the fact that Hana's husband is a werewolf (for lack of a better word), and by extension, so are her children. The bulk of the plot actually focuses on this small, but tight-knit family growing up and, through their hardship,  discover who they are and what they want out of life...and that doesn't just go for the kids, but for Hana as well. She definately wins the award for bravest and hardest working mom, as she must learn how to keep a house afloat and raise two very unusual and unconventional children, and ALL on her own (with only books and a few helpful neighbors for guidance). She cries, she gets frustrated, but she never gives up, and she always finds something to smile about. Her journey is both heartbreaking and inspiring, and by movie's end, she's learned how to let go and trust that her kids will be able to take care of themselves.

As for the kids, they're both loveable and unique--each with their own hopes and dreams. Yuki starts off very bold, brave, and feisty; embracing her wolf powers and diving into anything that interests her.  Ame, on the other hand, is far more quiet and timid; preferring to stay as a human, especially when he finds that most people tend to fear wolves. But as time goes on, and situations change, so do the children, and eventually, when the day comes for the kids to decide which half they ultimately want to be, it may come as a surprise to the viewer which forms each child takes...

Special mention should also be given to the animation. The artwork is utterly beautiful; showing nature in all its glory, with a simplistic musical score that's dotted throughout--setting the mood of all the important scenes, both the sad and the happy and the silly. And even many of the settings tie into and emphasize the duality of the children--in particular, a dirt road that either leads up into the mountains, or down into the nearby town. It serves as a literal crossroads for which path Yuki and Ame will choose...and for their poor mom stuck in the middle.

Suffice it to say, anyone who's a fan of Miyazaki's work and wants to see something similar, or any lover of anime and animation, or just want a greatly told modern day fairy tale, then they owe it to themselves to watch this film. Be warned, it's definitely recommended for older audiences, for its depictions or mentionings of death, nudity (including breast feeding), childbirth, sex, and the occasional swear word (but it's nothing too graphic--I'd rate this at a PG-13). And above all, have the tissue box ready.",1454457600,,4326,4.558558558558558

5440617,5,B00AJEL71S,One of my most favorite anime's out there! Very touching and heartwarming story. Gorgeously drawn and exceptionally voiced. I'm really a sucker for movies that tug at your heart strings! You will not be disappointed!,1452384000,,216,5.2
5440618,5,B00AJEL71S,"Absolutely loved this movie, certainly one of my top 5 films to-date. Everything from the animation, voice acting (I have not viewed it in English Dub yet), and music blended well into this charming tale about family. The story alone is unique, yet simple and has a very endearing emotion which is present thought the entire film.",1452297600,,330,4.807017543859649

5440624,3,B00AJEL71S,"This movie was much less child-friendly than I had expected. There is death and desertion alongside learning to be true to yourself and acceptance of others. While there were parts that were playful and fun for my kids (ages 9 and 12 - the ages of Yuki and Ami toward the end), they did not care for this movie at all. My husband and I kept getting sidetracked by the disjointedness of the film. I loved the crabby old neighbor and how he evolved, but as other neighbors began interacting with the family, their relationships were not particularly fulfilling. As the story progressed, the motivations of the characters were questionable. There is a big storm, and Hana is called to pick up Yuki at the school, but instead, she chooses to chase Ame up the hill? In a rainstorm? When he can clearly take care of himself? And speaking of Yuki being stuck at school - why did she and Souhei hide? Why was there no resolution about Souhei's mother? What was the reason for even mentioning Souhei's mother? I really wanted to like this, and I would have been happier it I had rented it. For what it's worth, my husband liked it better than I did, but said it is not something he would watch it again.",1451088000,,1194,4.45662100456621

Everything about this is so cute. Wolf Children has quickly become one of my favorite movies. The trailer really does a good job of setting up the story. I watched this online first, but I plan on buying the DVD ASAP.",1450915200,,375,4.371428571428571
5440627,4,B00AJEL71S,"I didn't know what I was getting into when I bought this, I did see the trailer but it is a very LONG movie. My little sister adores it, but I found it alright. The art for this movie is great and its quite an adorable movie, only its not as captivating as Spirited Away or  My Neighbor Totoro. Its great for the anime lover that is between the ages 12 and 16. I'm only giving 4 out of 5 because my little sister (who is 12) is enjoying the movie so much she wanted to take it on vacation with her.",1450828800,,498,3.8823529411764706

A harder struggle for this mother because her babies can turn into wolfs at will because of their father being A man wolf. She has to raise them all alone not able to seek help & take the risk that their secret will be exposed. With all these troubles she works hard to make sure her children will be safe, happy, & have the freedom to choose their own path of being human or wolf.

WARNING- what you might not want your child to see; Their is A scene where the couple are about to have relation & the man is in wolf form. They are in A dark silhouette & her back & shoulders are not covered as he moves in & they lay down, That is all that is shown here we do not see them in the act it's self.  In another scene we see her breast while she is breast feeding her child.",1438732800,2,910,3.9347826086956523
5440683,5,B00AJEL71S,"This movie is an amazing story. I'm very picky about my anime: must have an engaging story, no gratuitous sexual displays, any violence/nudity/profanity must be key to the plot and not just to make up for lack thereof, and I hate the cartoony exaggerated eyes popping out/arms waiving overreactions from characters. You may, then, believe I am not a true fan of anime. Maybe not. At any rate, my husband and I both loved this film. It pulls you in, makes you feel, entertains, and leaves you with a calm sense of closure. I'm so glad we bought it.",1438560000,3,547,4.5353535353535355

However, while there were many moments that seemed very real to me, there were others that were bizarre and overdramatized. The animation is lovely, and the soundtrack even more so. Ive enjoyed this movie enough to watch it several times in English and in Japanese with subtitles, but there is always that nagging pretentiousness that manifests itself just when the story is getting good. There will be that anime-clich moment that Ive seen somewhere before, a moment that was a brilliant representation of real life the first time I saw it, but now seems run-of-the-mill and affected now. However, there are some really nice moments that I had not seen before, ones that I could really relate to, and for those this movie is worth watching many times.",1436140800,,918,4.891025641025641

5440729,5,B00AJEL71S,"Japan has never really embraced the werewolf picture despite the fact that their own folklore includes many tales of animals transforming into humans.  While most western werewolf movies are horror films, Wolf Children takes the concept in the opposite direction.

The story follows a young woman named Hana who is intrigued by a young man who sits in on one of her college courses.  She discovers that he isn't actually a student but a day laborer.  The two become fast friends and eventually fall in love, which is a problem for the man because he harbors a secret.  He can transform into a wolf.  They eventually marry and have children, both of whom share his ability to become a wolf.  They must be hidden until they can be made to understand how dangerous this ability might be for them in Japanese society.

Due to the nature of the story, its hard to explain the content without spoiling the plot.  Ill just say that its an impressive treatise on parenting.  In this case, the sins of the father plague his children, and Hana is saddled with the task of helping them find their way through the world.  Director Mamoru Hosodas previous feature, Summer Wars (reviewed HERE), featured a large extended family and this one a small nuclear family, but the emotions are the same.  This is a moving film about true love.  Not romance or infatuation, but unconditional love and acceptance.  Its an altogether pleasant experience.

Hosoda began his career in television anime but hes shed that shallow aesthetic completely.  Wolf Children is the work of a mature artist with lots to say about his homeland.  This is his third feature and it shines more brightly than even the most recent Studio Ghibli releases.  While he makes some color choices that don't appeal to me, theres no denying that he has a keen visual eye.  The only thing better than his eye is his story sense, and I credit his increased success with a move away from other peoples scripts.

The animation here is astonishingly good.  Yes, theres a lot of computer work on display, but the CGI environments never overwhelm the characters.  I was riveted by the subtle animation that made every single character recognizable and sympathetic.  Its important to note that there are no villains in this tale.  Conflict, yes, but no one is evil.  Like many of the better Japanese films, Wolf Children is the welcome antithesis of the formulaic Hollywood feature.

All production departments deliver, but its the score by Masakatsu Takagi that stands out.  Its a pastoral composition that really sets the tone for the movie and maintains it throughout.  While I won't be humming the theme song, the music both grounds the story and allows it to fly.

I cant say enough good things about this feature.  Its that rare family film that will be equally compelling to all ages.  Very highly recommended.",1431820800,2,2857,4.793032786885246

5440731,3,B00AJEL71S,"I was excited to see this animation. The subject matter and the storyline were definitely interesting. The artwork was beautiful. But the storytelling--the articulation--of the story was lacking. Compared to a Miyazaki film, ""Wolf Children"" lacked finesse in the execution. The introduction dragged for longer than necessary. Different elements of the story were jagged. For example, the incident between Yuki and Souhei at school that led to an injury seemed avoidable. Isn't she faster than a human because of her wolf abilities? How was he able to catch up with her? Why didn't she just run away from school than risk discovery? And the old wolf that Ame saw in captivity, who was supposed to be a foil for what Ame didn't want to be, seemed lacking... Finally, the finale with Hana running through the woods searching for Ame blindly, and Ame's reason for leaving the human world so that he could protect the wilderness all seemed so bizarre and nonsensical. Perhaps, it is because I am from an American perspective so I don't understand the ""guardianship"" aspect of nature that is such a common theme in Japanese animation; but, I think it is more to the fact that the animation didn't show the fox nor Ame in any guardianship duty. They simply ran about hunting and drinking from streams--showing the beautiful side of nature--but not actually protecting anything. The wolf gods in Princess Mononoke had definitive guardianship roles. It might have been better if the creators of ""Wolf Children"" simply made Ame's reason for leaving home PURELY due to the fact that he wanted to be a wolf and not human, and without the noble blemish of the halfway-executed desire to be the guardian of the mountain.

I believe the film is worthy of watching at least once for its interesting theme and beautiful art. But it's not worth a re-watch.",1431302400,3,1838,4.891025641025641

Its not a killer, but it did distract for me from the otherwise great story line. To me more attention needed to be payed to the way people were drawn through every scene. Sometimes it worked well enough and this is a very good movie. I did debate though on giving it 3 stars instead of 4 because of some of the drawing short-cut taken with the people.

5440743,4,B00AJEL71S,"Let me start off by saying this review will have some spoilers in it, so you have been warned.

Wolf Children is the story of Hana, a college student who meets a werewolf and falls in love, has a whirlwind romance, gets pregnant, and ends up having to raise two werewolf children on her own when the father dies just after the two kids are born.  Hana deals with problems, some of which will be familiar to most parents, and others which will be familiar to most dog owners (such as chewing on furniture).  All things considered, Wolf Children is a solidly good movie.  However, its not as good as the hype its received.

Lets break it down:

Animation: 9.0  This is full of high quality visuals.  Absolutely beautiful, especially the gorgeous scenery once Hana moves to the country!  All the motion is smooth, the colors are outstanding and vivid, everything really looks amazing.  If there is any flaw, I would have to say the initial transformation of the father into a wolf was a bit of a letdown.  Its pretty much just a slow morph from man to man-wolf, and it really could have been a lot better.  This movie has little to offer in the way of effects, and this transformation was their chance to shine, and I feel it was a missed opportunity.  But still, its a small gripe.

On a side note, Im a bit confused as to why Wolf Daddy tells Hana not to watch him transform, and then proceeds to transform extremely slowly over a couple of minutes (which of course Hana sees), however it is clearly established later on that the transformation can be instant.

Sound: 8.0  The voice acting was great.  Very believable emotions, and the voices seemed to fit the characters very well.  The music was good but not great.  It was the typical orchestral background music which you would expect for a movie like this, and there really wasn't anything wrong with it.  However, there wasn't anything which I could listen to by itself.  To get a perfect ten in this category, I have to be looking for the music online after I finish watching the show, and thats not the case here.

Story: 7  The story is good.  We see approximately twelve years of Hana raising her two wolf children from infants to middle school.  Each has to find their own way, human or wolf, and it is interesting to see how they make their choices and how they deal with their dual natures.  This was a great concept, which you would expect from Mamoru Hosoda, who brought us Summer Wars and The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, but the concept wasn't masterfully executed.  Actually, it did seem like the movie was trying too hard to be a Ghibly film at times, especially once they moved to the country.  Specifically it was like watching Totoro, but with less magic and mystery.  It had the look but not the feel.  There are some scenes which are badly mishandled.  (spoiler)Toward the end, Ame, Hanas son, runs off to live full time in the woods as a wolf.  Unfortunately, instead of playing this as an emotional farewell, it is played for unnecessary drama and excitement.  For some reason which is never explained, he decides the best time to run off and leave mom is in the middle of a typhoon!  No explanation to mom, just open the door and split!  Mom, of course, runs after him nearly dying while trying to navigate the woods during the intense storm while searching for her son.  I suppose we are supposed to be worried about him, but I was fairly pissed off that he would put his mother through that.  Why didn't he just wait till the storm had passed?  Why didn't he explain to Hana what he was doing?  Because the show was nearing its end, and they needed a dramatic climax, thats why.  It was fairly obvious and I was not impressed by it.  To make the kid even more of a dick, its at least implied that he never even comes back to visit poor old mom after deciding that the woods are a better home than the one shes been providing.  Finally, the story lacks any real ending at all.  We get to see that the children have decided which world they want to live in, but thats as close to a resolution as we are going to get.

Oh, one more thing.  When Ame goes off to spend time with a fox who lives on the nearby mountain, I couldn't help thinking of Disneys The Fox and the Hound.

Characters: 7  Hana is the main character, and that may be one of the movies biggest problems.  Miyazakis films had a sense of wonder, mostly because we experience the world through the eyes of very young characters.  In this movie, we mostly experience it through the eyes of an adult going through difficult circumstances.  The story is narrated and told by the daughter, but she is only a central character for the last half of the movie.  The father is a real letdown.  He is only in the movie very briefly, has only a few lines, and apparently passed on a genetic predisposition to run outside during horrible weather.  In fact, we never even learn his name, which pretty much relegates him to the status of an extra.  The unfortunate result is that that when he dies, we lack the emotional attachment which we would normally have for such a character, and although we feel bad for Hana, we don't know the father well enough to feel the loss as we should.

Overall:  7.75  I liked it.  I would recommend it.  However, theres nothing here thats going to bring you back for a re-watch.  Still, it is a pretty high quality production, and so I would say its worth the $19 pricetag.  I should also point out that my wife and daughter actually got pissed off at me for not giving it a perfect 10 rating, so it apparently appeals more to female audiences.  But I stand by my review.",1428969600,,5634,4.415937803692906

Touching and well done.  The only thing I would say if you have a young child watching is that there is an early scene where Hana and the wolf kiss and then they lay down in bed together.  They are undressed so on two levels it was uncomfortable b/c my daughter was shocked by both a woman and a wolf kissing and then being undressed together and what did that mean.

The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because like I said I'm not really into these kind of movies.

I wasn't really considering buying it -- it was just an after thought and the reason I chose it for my monthly anime purchase. Boy was I not disappointed! I completely loved it! I rarely write reviews in Amazon -- but this Anime warranted my promotion. Heck -- I forced my father to watch with me despite the fact that he dislikes them since I watch them so much. I got out a reluctant -- ""Eh...it was ok"" remark from him! Never, had I been so satisfied :D

This Anime expresses the true innocence of children and the hardship a single parent and mother had to go through to raise her children as best as she could. It is a wonderful journey that shows how each child develops into their person and how the mother copes in raising children unlike all other. I never thought an Anime would ever rank this high on my list since Miyasaki's Princess Mononoke. If you are a fan of Anime -- please purchase this! You won't regret it!! Blue-ray please --- otherwise you are doing a disservice to yourself!

After watching it, please rate it. Let's all spread the tale and experience it together :D",1420934400,,1237,4.373913043478261

Without spoiling anything and to give a comprehensive review I'll just compare it to some other animations out there:  When it comes to mother/child relationship it's not as sad as Dumbo; when it comes to a child's magical discoveries and wonderment, it's not as charming as My Neighbor Totoro.  The ending has a slight twist of irony but nothing inspirational, and to be honest, I just feel bad for the mother.

It's still a nice work of art, however, I'm afraid this will be one of those story that you tend to forget in a month or two after viewing.",1420243200,4,696,4.536

But this is a beautiful movie of nature and have some topics that anime only can covered. The characters are great and you can related to in a way or more.

I watched this twice now. The second time was with my grandma. She never see any anime shows and movies with me. She really love it. I was surprised about that. But I knew that she would like it.

For being 84 minutes movie, It felt like a 3 hour movie because of the pacing. I didn't mind that. It was nice. I honestly can sit back with a cup of hot cocoa and a plate of dessert and eat while I watch it. I almost cried during the several parts of the movies. That is rare for a movie do that to me.

To have it on blu-ray and DVD, I can give this movie to anyone that have a blu-ray player or don't have a blu-ray player. I really recommend this to anyone. I don't care if you are a non-anime fan or super action fan, you should watch this. Just sit down with a soda/ coffee or something like that and food and watch this movie.

What is the base of the strong, special bond between them? The lack of character building also made it hard for me to care for either of them. The second part, when they try to live in the countryside, was better and more suitable for children to watch. But the same problem happened again when Yuki met Sohei. The plot is very weak on how the two meet and become friends. I didn't expect the story and characters to be so weak...

Our entire family loved it, and we were blown away. It's not some cutesy film. It eschews stereotypes and places an incredibly strong woman into an impossible circumstance, trying to raise the two children of a werewolf alone after their father (her husband) is killed in a mysterious accident. 'Wolf Children' is a masterwork of animation and storytelling, a deeply emotional experience; often funny, beautifully animated and epic in scope. It clocks in at just over two hours, and master animator Mamoru Hosada packs a wallop of a story into those two hours. Absolutely amazing.",1419465600,,722,5.025

However, if anyone has an imagination and is willing to see things that are not mainstream America, then this movie should be watched. It is bloody brilliant, has depth, and characters people can easily bond with during the short storyline. I know many people like to look for things just because they desire to see it, and with this movie it can easily be seen, yet it does not detract from the storyline in any way, but enhances the human understanding of those who are different.",1419120000,,559,4.544554455445544

5440982,5,B00AJEL71S,"Easily one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. At times it looks absolutely gorgeous, computer animated or not. The story is very touching, being incredibly sad and charming at many different moments. It's pacing is also amazing. It's about 2 hours, but never in my multiple times watching it have I felt like 2 hours went by. It felt more like maybe 45 minutes.

I can't say whether or not non-anime fans will enjoy it. My mother refuses to watch it because she says the title ""Wolf Children"" doesn't sound interesting to watch, and she rarely takes animation seriously. However, anyone already a fan of the style will absolutely love it.",1416528000,3,649,4.692982456140351

5440998,5,B00AJEL71S,"Loved it! I am a tad bit disappointed with the people who rated it one star. This movie was aimed at a more mature audience and should be rated from there.
The story is about a woman who falls in love with a werewolf and gives birth to two ""Wolf Children,"" as the title suggests. Soon after, her husband dies in an accident, and the plot goes on to tell of the hardships of raising her children alone in the country, and what the family becomes. Some parts can be depressing and I would rate it 11+ due to these scenes, but overall the story has positive role models, good lessons, little violence, no profanity, not many love scenes, no consumerism, and no alcohol use. (Lots of no's there!)
Product details: I received this package in two days because I am a Prime member. The case was in beautiful condition with the plastic wrapping still on. The box is not plastic, but it is cardboard. The disc does not include the Japanese version but that was fine with me, as the actors fit the roles perfectly. Subtitles work great. Five stars for this excellent movie!",1414713600,,1063,4.456410256410257

The people, the landscapes - everything was a world I wanted to be a part of.  Take heed that the viewers in my house were 21 and 22, and though this may look cheery, I highly recommend you NOT purchase this film for the kiddies.

5441094,5,B00AJEL71S,Wolf Children is touching anime movie about a human woman who has to raise her two wolf children (they can shape shift between human and wolf). The mother has very many difficulties raising them without any knowledge of how to raise wolf children and has to make sure not to let it out about what they are. She struggles as she moves to the country to try to let them feel free to shift and make the choice of what they want to be all on their own. The movie has stunning artwork that takes your breath away at some points. I recommend this movie to people that like Studio Ghibli movies and movies like Children Who Chase Lost Voices.,1410566400,,635,4.3
5441095,5,B00AJEL71S,"A very heartfelt movie. Mamoru Hosoda (who also directed The Girl Who Leaped Through Time and Summer Wars) creates another fantastic story in Wolf Children.

As she struggles with these choices, her children themselves wrestle with their own self identities as they try to find out who they are and where they belong.",1410566400,,467,4.63855421686747

This is what family entertainment is all about. The story was clear, understandable and uncluttered by a lot of convoluted messages. The people who made this, don't assume that the audience needs to be led by the nose through a story and I found it to be a good match for my family. The kids were kids that we all could recognize and they managed to capture the essence of family beautifully within the world they crafted.

5441129,3,B00AJEL71S,"I saw the movie on youtube and it was ok, if it wasn't really about wolves and maybe about vampies or something then it would be ok. If they also didn't show that sex scene or that death scene then it would be a bit better. It was also sad that Ame left his mother and if they were more of normal children like Yuki was except at times, then it would be a bit more better. The movie was okay since the mother was a good mother to her children and she didn't die. The design was also great and maybe if it was a slice of life it would be a bit more better. But in my rating I would give it 3 stars or even 3 and a half maybe, But to be honest I would get the manga and not the dvd since the manga gives you less feelings and such.",1408233600,,729,3.7096774193548385

This is a wonderful full length animated film with a great story line, interesting characters that you can really care about and high quality animation, again reminiscent of the many Studio Ghibli films. The Blu-ray visuals and audio are excellent. Unlike most anime, there is no silliness to be found here. The story is highly intelligent and is often quite emotional.  A good family film but be aware that while there is no nudity, smoking, graphic sex, swearing, drug use or violence this is a serious film about adult situations often found in real life, to include the death of someone you love. A must have for any serious anime collector. I consider this to be one of the 10 best anime films of all time. Two paws way up for this one!",1407024000,,988,4.458563535911602

5441154,5,B00AJEL71S,"This film was absolutely beautiful. The animation was stunning and what Hosoda never fails to do with his films is capture the essence and feeling embodied in the characters. Just like Summer Wars' feeling of making a viewer a member of the family reunion, Wolf Children captures you and makes you feel as if you are part of the family or one of their neighbors at least. Wolf Children tosses aside corny melodramatic tendencies in anime and gives you true emotion that you can actually FEEL. Almost every reaction I've seen to the film involves tears being shed (not that it's a bad thing) over the events that take place. I almost had the same reaction while watching it for the first time. However, a few days later I listened to the soundtrack and almost lost it. The soundtrack is BRILLIANT and captures the nature of the film perfectly. It adds layers of soft pianos, motherly voices, and what remind me of lullabies. I cannot recommend this film enough to any audience and you can truly feel the emotions portrayed in this film; heartbreak, passion, but most importantly, joy.",1405987200,,1083,4.735449735449736

There are no werewolves in this film. They are simply creatures that can turn into people and wolves. Its very simple, but I know people who cannot take extremely minor shifts in expectation. If you are looking for a giant mystical story this is not it. The magic in this film is the story of a family (in the same way The Iron Giant is about ""a boy and his dog""). Get what I mean?

I would have given 5 out of 5 if the story went on for 5 or 10 more years, **spoiler**  it ended when the kids were 10 as if they were all grown up and ready to live on their own.  I guess it was a cultural thing for me, since I know families to be together well into the 20's of the kids.

5441177,5,B00AJEL71S,"This is a beautiful and deep film. It is probably more meaningful for adults than children, because it's about the universal experience of being a parent. Despite the werewolf premise it is very realistic and very sad. I think it might be troubling or frightening for young children, though it was the most popular film in Japan last year. The animation is lovely, paying much attention to tiny details like the glint of a car window being rolled down, or a small wildflower.

A coed falls for a mysterious guy hanging around the college campus she attends; turns out he's a wolf spirit in human form but that doesn't put a damper on the relationship. They move in together and after the second child of their union is born tragedy strikes. There' a relocation to the country and some of the most amazing depictions of nature I've ever seen in an anime, including Miyazaki's ""My Neighbor Totoro."" Both exhilarating and heart-breaking, just like life itself.",1404691200,,659,4.7894736842105265

5441181,5,B00AJEL71S,This rivals any Hayao Miyazaki film with it's stunning animation and exhilarating story with so much heart. The only warning I'd give to parents is that there is a tiny bit of nudity when the mother breast feeds her baby and there is suggestible adult content between the girl and the wolf but only suggestible nothing blatant. There is such beauty here between humanity and nature and the choice the children have to make between the two worlds. Definitely a welcome addition to my collection of animated classics.,1404259200,,515,4.863636363636363

5441184,5,B00AJEL71S,"This is really a nice story, the story of a brother and sister with their mother.

Not to dwell on the plot, the mother, Hana (flower), meets a guy and falls in love and they start having children. Oh, by the way, he is also a wolf, a Japanese werewolf. They willfully morph and retain most of their human faculties - no slavering, terrifying and murderous sort here. They have two children, Yuki (snow) the girl and Ame (rain) the boy.

Then it gets complicated.

The story is beautiful. It is about how the siblings grow up and grow different while Hana grows also. The story is extremely satisfying and you really care for the characters.

The artwork, the voice acting and the music is very good, excellent even. This is just a well-produced anime and represents the best of what is good about Japanese anime.

Wolf Children was breathtakingly beautiful both in art and storyline. It is incredibly unique and will amaze viewers if only for the backgrounds and music. Though it does feature some of the most developed animated characters I have ever seen. Definitely one of my all time favorite films.

The BluRay is great, it comes with a cardboard slip (as a lot of films do now) which has the title in shiny gold.

If you are a fan of Japanese animation for its deep and complicated themes, this DVD is certainly worth buying. Christians may not like the idea of ""bestiality"" and ""shape shifting"" as the father is a human who can morph into a wolf (or wolf who can morph into a human).  However, if you can get past that aspect, the gravamen of the film is how children who don't seem to fit in, learn how to find their place in the world and their coming of age, all under the guidance of a dedicated single mother.",1403913600,,586,4.2792792792792795

5441193,5,B00AJEL71S,"Wolf Children is yet another testament to the beauty of animation. Most people think of animation as a genre for children full of fairytales by Disney and goofy comedy by Nick and CN. Japan continues to defy these American conventions and pushes animation into the storytelling to entertain even adults. As C.S. Lewis once said: ""A children's story that does not entertain adults is a bad children's story."" Director Mamoru Hosoda tells a story of a young woman who falls in love with a man who is part wolf. They marry and start a small quiet family of their own in their apartment in the city. Through tragic events the woman is left as a single mother with children who are also part wolf. The story covers 10 years of her life as a struggling single mom trying to raise wolf children. It's a heart warming tale of the joy's and struggles of parenthood. Mamoru Hosoda is a director to keep an eye on, especially with the legendary Hayao Miyazaki finally laying down the pencil and retiring amongst the greats. With two cult classics ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,"" and ""Summer Wars,"" Mamoru Hosoda has very strong work under his belt. He masterfully tells stories of young love, family, and parenting with a dash of sci-fi and fantasy yet grounds theme in to such a reality that you will find your self feeling like you have experienced these exact moments in your own life. ""Wolf Children"" is yet another masterpiece by Hosoda. One that if you enjoy animation or even just a good story, is worthy of being in your movie collection.",1403481600,,1538,4.637362637362638
5441194,4,B00AJEL71S,"As stated, in my opinion I enjoyed Summer Wars more. That being said, it was a pleasant movie. The story was indeed heart warming and endearing. And it delivers everything it promises. I suppose what I missed from it was a climax. A moment where it makes me really feel that excitement or joy or pure happiness at how it all comes to a close. That moment where it leaves you in goosebumps and you feel like you're almost about to cry from the overall perfection you feel it has created (almost). With Summer wars, I felt all of that. It drew me in, and I was invested. I cared about the characters and what happened to them, I wanted them to succeed. It was such and amazing family....
With Wolf Children everything is so low key. Not that that's a bad thing of course. But with all the build up for the movie, it wasn't what I expected. Though the movie is long I feel like you don't really get to know or connect with Hana. There really isn't much else I can say about that. It's a story about a single mother trying to raise her two wolf children and learning as she goes in the struggle to keep them safe. All the while helping them decide which path of life they want to pursue. That is really what the whole movie is about. It's very low key, evenly paced, it has touching moments and warm scenes of kindness. But overall, I feel that if you aren't a mother, have children, or even more a single mother. It's kind of hard to fully relate and therefore fully appreciate the small victories and precious accomplishments and trials and tribulations of motherhood.",1403395200,,1566,4.366438356164384

Her life is full of endless possibilities, until she meets a man. She falls in love and moves in with him (we never learn his name.) He reveals to Hana his deepest secret; he can change into a wolf, at will.
Hana is startled, yet intrigued.
She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a girl, Yuki, one winter day. The following spring, Hana has a baby boy, Ami. She thinks life is wonderful until her man-wolf suddenly dies under mysterious circumstances. Now Hana is alone with her children, both of whom inherited their father's genes and can turn into wolves. Fearful of discovery, Hana decides to move way out into the countryside, where she hopes the children can decide for themselves who they really are.

5441213,5,B00AJEL71S,"I was a little doubtful when I decided to watch this movie with my mom on Mother's Day, because I'd heard about the ending being sad, but we both enjoyed the film very much. It has many meaningful and relatable messages; a mother's love is powerful, choice is paramount for children, and that most, if not all parents, experience similar emotions when their children come of age.

The mother, Hana, is a single mother who takes care of her two children, who have the ability to change into wolves. I won't talk about the specifics of what happened to her husband, but something obviously does, and it is explained in the film. She is incredibly kind, tolerant, and cares deeply for her children. Taking care of them on her own is difficult, especially when they start off in a new home on the countryside and she must make repairs to the decrepit home she purchased and later, learn to raise crops. But some of the times they share together are heartwarming, funny, and beautiful to see. The artwork for this film is simply staggering, and I look forward to more quality works like this from the director, Mamoru Hosuda.

About halfway through, the movie begins to deal more with the children, Ame and Yuki, and about how they are growing up and finding their own paths in life - something that Hana wanted to give them when she decided to move them out of the big city and to the countryside. All I will say is that the siblings' paths diverge; they both make different choices. One is not better than the other, and neither are bad choices.

In this half of the movie, you also start getting some feeling for what parents experience when their children grow up. I'm no parent, but I could feel it because I was right beside my mom when we watched the film - and she was crying. ***Minor SPOILER alert here, so skip to the next paragraph if you deem it necessary.*** Many parents raise their children with great love and care, but when it's finally time for them to ""spread their wings and fly,"" it can be an emotional time. It's hard to let go sometimes, or rather, to accept the reality. I think parents fully understand that, but it's still hard. Hana has to deal with the same thing, and seemingly very early on to Western parents.

The ending is bittersweet, I'd say. It's happy, but sad at the same time. I guess it depends on how you look at it, and especially depends on what position you have in the family (father, mother, child, etc) - that is all I'm going to say.

All in all, it's a great family movie. I watched it twice with my mom already, once with just her, and then again with my dad and brother. Even if you aren't into anime or you have family members that aren't into anime, you can still pick up this film and enjoy it without any problems. I highly recommend it!

***Note: I've noticed these criticisms in some of the lower-rated reviews I've read for this film. I'm not here to argue or to say anyone is wrong, I would just like to give some insight to readers who may have concerns. What I'm talking about is what some have called ""implied bestiality.""

***SPOILER, READ ON ONLY IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE AFOREMENTIONED*** Shortly after the husband reveals his wolf side to Hana, they return home to consummate their love. They are both in a dark room with only their silhouettes showing, but the husband stays in his half-wolf form. He touches her cheek, asks her if she is afraid of him, and then they both lay down off-screen. That's the extent of the scene. For adults and young teens, it's clear that they're about to have sex - but personally, at least, I didn't see it as that. It was more about Hana's ultimate acceptance of her mate, and reassurance to the husband about the woman he loves. I don't think the scene was depicted as sexual. If you have concerns about this because of the ""implied bestiality,"" however, I've already described the full scene. That's all there is, so you can make your judgment from there.",1401494400,25,3960,4.484049930651873

There are at least a couple brief scenes that may be uncomfortable/awkward to some; an intimate moment involving a wolf and a breast-feeding moment. I had no problem with either one, but the first I could definitely see being troublesome for certain people.

Themes are similar to Totoro but aimed at a more mature audience.  There is more dramatic tension and conflict between characters.  Conflicts are resolved peacefully.

My kids were really glued to the screen. They especially liked the early parts of the film that depicts the wolf children growing up. There is little to no violence and only one intimate scene but nothing explicit is portrayed. It's fine for all age groups.

Two criticisms: The movie is a tad long and towards the end it does drag a bit. The other criticism is that it's not the type of movie you or the kids will watch again and again (unlike Frozen or Ponyo which have been played in my house many times over).

5441235,5,B00AJEL71S,"This movie is a wonderful surprise as it approaches a subject often the topic of horror and violence.  From the high def graphics to the innocent humor of a truly unique plot, it tells the story of a woman who falls in love with a very gentle man, only to find out he is a werewolf.  Forget what you know about the legends, this one deals with the reality, where even as a wolf, the human intellect remains.  More over, it is the tale of a mother, Hana, earning to cope with her children's journey to become themselves.

Having been a single parent, I can honestly tell you the authors got this part of the film correct.  Being a single parent is hard.  It is extremely difficult, however, when the children switch back and forth from kid to puppy.  When they get sick, do you take them to the doctor?  Or is a veterinarian the correct choice?  Laugh if you want to, but for Hana, it's a real problem.  The same goes for trying to explain to the landlord why there were barking/baying sounds coming from an apartment when pets are NOT allowed!  And just what vaccinations to you give the kids?  The list goes on . . .

Only after moving to an isolated rural community does Hana finally learn the value of having friends she can trust.

The graphics are excellent.  One sequence in particular is stunning: the first country snowfall.  The morning where Hana runs and plays with the children (in wolf form) through the woods and down a steep hillside feels very three dimensional even though it isn't.  The kingfisher/river part of this sequence is especially as well done as it is poignant.

All and all, this film earned every one of the awards it has been given.  Regardless of fantasy element, this is one of the more heart-warmingly HUMAN stories I've seen in a while.  It rightfully deserves to become a classic!",1399420800,2,1816,4.495412844036697

5441238,5,B00AJEL71S,"Soothing piano melodies, an eco-conscious sensibility, pet-care and gardening metaphors frame this fantastical animated tale about the challenges of a new mother making a home for her family, raising bestial children with the readied resilience to find their place in a sometimes stormy world.

By turns sprightly and melancholic as the story's sibling protagonists, this tender tribute to motherhood (comparable to the 1948 fictional memoir&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Remember-Mama/dp/B0004Z322O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Remember Mama</a>&nbsp;starring Irene Dunne) sparkles with a thoughtful script and organic scenery rendered tactile by CGI flourishes, while immersive vocal performances (Japanese/English) and the sentimental swell of its music inspire thankful tears for mothers everywhere.

The narrative plays equally well at face value or by a deeper read of its allegorical layering (per review title). Mother Hana blooms with best intentions for her kids and a smile undeterred by adversity; it takes a village to nurture her garden, which she's advised won't grow up overnight. Daughter Yuki proves vibrant and capricious as the snow of her Japanese namesake; her drama involving a boy who lends his ear at school might just the same represent the vulnerability of baring any delicate secret of the heart. Younger brother Ame is as sullen as a rainy day, growing emotionally distant as a lone wolf toward adolescence, his senses tuned to the call of the wild. An overturned cradle of nestlings glimpsed in the woods resonates worryingly in the viewer's mind later again as Hana's litter prepare to leave the nest. Monsoon rains symbolic of life's hardships evoke the hazard of a storm sewer and river waters stirring earlier transformative events. The revisited image of a mountain photograph placed at the family hearth takes on new significance as the narrator reminisces about a supportive parent held tall in memory. The nomadic perspective of a pup left a less picturesque parenting experience is also scratched at.

Anime regulars will recognize the influence of Miyazaki's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Neighbor-Totoro/dp/B002ZTQV8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Neighbor Totoro</a>&nbsp;in dabs that may feel too familiar -- wide-mouthed laughter, a child's eager exploration of a new backyard -- but this pensive film confidently asserts its own mature voice (or howl).

I bought this movie on a whim after reading someone gush about it online. When my wife and I sat down to watch it last night, we had very little idea of what we were getting into, outside of cute little pup children that we found endearing. This film is one of the best animated movies we have ever seen, easily keeping up with the best that Disney has to offer, while also shying away from the typical ""adventure plot"" that Disney seems to stick to.

I truly don't want to spoil much of the movie, but the film revolves around a family with two wolf children that can seemingly change without any thought, and the life that they try to make in the rural countryside.

5441262,5,B00AJEL71S,"""Wolf Children"", a Japanese animated feature directed by Mamoru Hosoda, is one of those films that captivate one's imagination and tug at one's heartstrings all at the same time. It certainly had me watching it several times over in the week that I had it on loan from the library (and I plan on purchasing it for my collection). I watched it with my nine--year-old daughter who loves all of Miyazaki's feature films and is beginning to develop a love of quality Japanese and even Korean anime (well, at least those that are suitable for her age group). ""Wolf Children"" is a perfect blend of folklore, character development, quality animation, and a wonderful score.

The story begins with a female voice narrating the story of her mother Hana's life. Hana, a young university student at the International University in Tokyo, falls in love with a mysterious young man who after a while reveals himself to be a Wolf Man, the last descendant of a line that can transform into wolves. The couple share an idyllic life for several years, and grow their family with the birth of a girl named Yuki and a boy named Ame. Tragedy forces Hana to move to the countryside where she struggles to raise her two young children, who have inherited their father's ability to transform into a wolf.

The themes of familial love, of being at one with nature and living off the land, as well as the ever present struggle between two different worlds, i.e. the world of man vs. the world of the wild, is beautifully explored in this film. The scenic setting of the Japanese countryside with its cascading waterfalls, the beautiful wintry landscape etc. make this one of the most beautiful animated features I've seen. The plot is compelling and Hana is a strong yet sympathetic figure, trying her best to be a good mother even though she is assailed by doubts as to how to raise two wolf children. The children, Yuki and Ame are well-delineated: Yuki plays the fiery older sibling whose wolf side is very much evident when she is little but who matures into a beautiful young woman more at ease with her human self; conversely, Ame is a timid boy who shies away from his wolf self as a child, but develops a strong connection to nature as he matures and feels his wolf side getting stronger as the years pass. This dichotomy between the world of man and the world of animals and nature is explored in a manner that is easy to comprehend, even for a nine-year-old.  The score for this film is amazing, with music that soothes and inspires, including a Japanese lullaby that is haunting to listen to.

I highly recommend this for fans of quality storytelling. The English dialogue never distracts nor is it jarring; in fact, it blends in beautifully, making me forget that this was originally in Japanese. I hope to check out Hosoda's other offerings.",1396742400,,2829,4.674698795180723
5441263,4,B00AJEL71S,"(A Little Spoiler) I really really loved this movie, but what really got to me was Hana. She lost the love of her life after only 2 or 3 years of being with him. Then her son, i get that he had a calling to the forest but, i felt as if he just left her there to hang dry. After going through 11 difficult years of raising wolf/human kids I felt as if she needed a break. I don't know he could spent more time with her or showed her that he appreciated her for trying but He didn't really, he just left. And from the ending where his howling follows through with the wind it seems as if thats the only way she communicates with her which is sad because she's only there by herself because the daughter obviously thought her mother couldn't get any lonelier so she leaves to go to a dormitory high school. I get why all of this happened i really do but i guess i felt as if Hana got the bad end of the deal. No one ever asked what she wanted, and that kind of got to me....some people may see it a different way but thats my PointOfView. :)",1396656000,,1038,3.971291866028708

5441283,5,B00AJEL71S,"**Small Spoiler Alert**

I went into this movie blind as I had not watched another movie from this director. But, I'm a big Hiyazaki fan so I figured I'd give it a try. I was nothing short of blown away, I can't think of another movie in recent memory that I have enjoyed as much as Wolf children.

The movie starts with college age Hana meeting a man and falling in love. The man, however, turns out to be a wolf. Hana decides that love can overcome any challenges that might arise from his condition and the two eventually bring two beautiful children into the world together. Unfortunately, a cruel twist of fate takes Hana's mate from her all too soon and leaves her alone to raise their two children. This section is quick and not entirely the focus of the movie, but is very important nonetheless. Seeing how deeply Hana cared for her husband and the loss that she suffers is critical to understanding her motivation as a character and more importantly, as a mother. Just keep smiling.

Hana is left living in a small apartment with two quickly growing wolf children and no source of income. Being the mother of children who can't control whether or not they remain in their human form, or turn into a wolf-pup and trash the apartment is no easy task, especially once prying eyes begin to suspect something is amiss. Hana decides that it would be best for her small family to move far out into the countryside where they can have more privacy and give her time to learn the best ways to raise her young pups.

Watching the children slowly grow into who they choose to be, and seeing Hana overcome so many struggles is where this movie shines. There are no stereotypical archetypes that are so common in these types of movies. everything feels genuine and heartfelt. You will fall in love with Hana, Yuki and Ame.

The animation throughout is stellar and absolutely beautiful. The picture quality on this Blu-Ray release is fantastic, and the English dub is very good, one of the best in my recent memory.

I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who is even slightly interested.

It was a bit pathetic, how he died. Also, the way they introduced characters and then suddenly cut them out without any reason was also weird.

Wolf Children exceeded my expectations as there were times I almost cried and that doesn't happen too often with anime films.  The movie is well paced and does an excellent job of character development.  There were some great messages within the film itself and not to mention very beautiful moments that makes you wish the movie never ended.  If you're looking for action and adventure then this movie isn't for you.

The Blu-ray version comes with 3 dvds (which I haven't seen the other 2 yet) with extras on them.  I would recommend watching this if you're in the mood for some heartwarming moments and family time.

Check out Mamoru Hosada's other films such as ""Summer Wars"" and ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time""  You won't be disappointed with Wolf Children I can tell you that.  Great movie.  Great Purchase.",1393545600,,1044,4.675824175824176

A movie for all ages, no matter how young or old.",1393372800,,161,3.909090909090909
5441314,5,B00AJEL71S,This is one of the most beautiful and well told stories I have ever seen done for an anime. It's a great journey told between a mother and her two children that struggle between being a wolf or being human.,1393200000,,206,4.175
5441315,4,B00AJEL71S,"I'm not sure why they needed to be werechildren, as I think it would have worked just as well if they had been normal children. It is a sweet story of a tough woman overcoming a tough situation.",1393200000,,194,4.131578947368421
5441316,5,B00AJEL71S,"A sweet movie about a not considered so sweet topic - that of werewolves etc. It is well handled and set in an innocent time, which rendered the young teenager I was watching with totally mesmerized. It wasn't childish, but rather intelligently handled, with beautiful animation. A story about unusual love, and unconditional parenting.
Loved it.",1393200000,,346,5.196428571428571
5441317,5,B00AJEL71S,"But when Ame makes up his mind I could not help it.
One of the best animated movies from Japan in the last two decades, poignant and marvelously animated",1393113600,,153,4.310344827586207
5441319,5,B00AJEL71S,"Very great story and anime all together. This one really touches at your heart and will bring tears. It tried jerking a few from me, but my daughter and her friend went through a box of Kleenex with this one. Definitely worth the money.",1393113600,,236,4.386363636363637
5441320,5,B00AJEL71S,"Beautiful, funny and smart. This movie is something of a meditation on love and family - It begins with romantic love - moving through love of children, love of family, love of community, and ending with self acceptance and letting go. Although the story involves children that are half human and half wolf (which would seem to be fodder for big fantasy) - it is a movie full of small moments and real feeling - more about the struggles of a single mother and her family than anything else. The animation is lovely, The score is stirring and the pace is somewhat similar to movies like ""My Neighbor, Totoro""  - where the story sort of slowly unfolds and the drama is internally driven. There are no bad guys. The ending is a bit off and unresolved - which would be my major complaint - but I still loved the movie overall.

It's mostly appropriate for children - no extreme violence, some funny scenes and a plot that works on many levels. As I said before, it's not a speedy movie - My kid seems to be able to handle it and I am grateful to have something as good as this that we both thoroughly enjoy.",1393113600,,1103,4.349514563106796
5441321,5,B00AJEL71S,Beautiful.  Absolutely fantastic and bittersweet until the end.  Also a few surprises here and there.  But a lot of beautiful family moments.,1393113600,,141,5.318181818181818
5441322,5,B00AJEL71S,The story is very well told and touching. The cinematography and art are captivating. Just watch it - it's a wonderful movie!,1393027200,,125,4.7272727272727275
5441323,5,B00AJEL71S,"Normally not my kind of film (I often find Japanese cinema to be frustrating, i.e. I don't think i appreciated ""Ran"" as much as the next guy), I can honestly say that I was not just pleasantly surprised by this film, but absolutely floored.  I cannot recall another film in recent memory that captures the dynamic ever changing experience of growth and maturation as well as this one does.  Ironic that it captures this most human of conditions in characters that are only half-human.

This film is partially an examination of love and dedication, and all the angles and edges that are so often neglected or done poorly in modern cinema.  It's handling is mature in every sense of the word.  You see love be born, grow, die, become reborn, and grow again, until you feel as though you've aged and loved for a hundred years in only two hours.

Unapologetically sentimental and perhaps not entirely original, I was surprised that despite that fact, I still felt as though what I was experiencing was somehow fresh, crisp, and clean.

If you're into the works of Miyazaki, or Japanese/Asian cinema (and I don't mean Naruto or One-Piece, not that there's anything wrong with that if that's what you're into), this is a must-see.  Either way, I definitely recommend this film.  Heck, watch it with your mother.  Even better, watch it before Mother's day as motivation to do more than do the Hallmark shopping card run.",1393027200,,1413,4.754098360655738

5441325,5,B00AJEL71S,This movie was magical. Easily as good as a Miyazaki film. Heart warming and mysterious. The animation is unique and (for an animation geek) fascinating.,1392854400,,153,5.16
5441326,5,B00AJEL71S,Beautiful story. It tugs on the heart. If your a big anime fan or in the mood for a simple love story this is a good one. I plan on telling all of my anime loving friends it's a must see. For the big anime people its the quality of work that had I not know better it I might think it was a studio ghibli work.,1392854400,,309,3.626865671641791
5441327,5,B00AJEL71S,"This one of the few animes, films or series, that I consider a masterpiece.  The story is one of the best I have ever seen in a movie, animated or live action.  The animation is top notch. After Summer Wars I had complete faith in the director, and I was not disappointed. The only thing I was worried about was Funimation's dub, but it was done very well.",1392768000,,356,4.220588235294118

reminds me of a studio Ghilibi movie. :)

5441331,5,B00AJEL71S,MAD FEELS IN THIS MOVIE! it was phenomenal and full of emotion and smiles. I have made several family members watch it and they all loved it. Anime lovers or not,1392681600,,161,4.225806451612903
5441332,3,B00AJEL71S,"The story is okay, and the animation is really good. There are a couple of really ""cute"" scenes which are good for a laugh. I watched the whole thing because I had enough interest to want to find out what was going to happen, however, I don't have to see it again. I think it's suitable for all ages, but teenagers likely aren't going to find it interesting.",1392681600,3,358,4.279411764705882
5441333,5,B00AJEL71S,"My kids and I loved it! A bit mature for little ones but still my 6 year old asks to watch it all the time. Nothing like it in American animation. Pixar used to get close to the emotional level back in the day, but they've switched to all flash and little substance.

Also, bought Summer Wars, and while not as good as Wolf Children, its worth a watch.",1392681600,,352,4.101449275362318
5441334,3,B00AJEL71S,"I'm sort of conflicted on this review because my biggest issue was that it was weird, and my biggest compliment was that it was weird. The story was really well written, the artwork greatly detailed. I believed everything that I saw. Despite being about a sort of ""werewolf"" race, it was so realistic. Every problem the mother faced was reasonable, her reactions understandable, and the author had a deep understanding as well as thought and effort into what would happen.

I know from experience that Japanese plot structure follows different trends than ours, but I can't help but feeling like something is missing without the American big, bang climax.

We follow the life of a young woman over about 15 years (estimate). She starts in college where she meets a strange man. He is not enrolled in classes, has no family or friends, and seems distant. In a series of short scenes, almost montage-esque, we see a natural and understandable courtship, in which he reveals to her to be the last member of a long lost clan who are part wolf. His parents are dead and no one who raised him knew.

The woman gets pregnant, and they try to survive. She has another child, then the father passes away. (This is not a spoiler, it's the plot.) Afterwords she must find a means to live raising two children who, for the first part of their lives, she can't take out for fear of being exposed.

Because it's about a long passage of time and the plot is a ""living life,"" sort of conflict, the structure of the story is odd, more serial than anything else. On one side, I liked it, but it could get monotonous after a while; sort of like watching someone play The Sims. The characters were unique and well developed. I liked them all. The ending was understandable, and bittersweet. It could be happy or sad depending on how you looked at it.

I give it three stars because I wasn't in love with it. After I saw it, I was left feeling existential in the ""There was no point to watching that movie."" Four stars requires excitement that I could not muster, five requires obsession which I did not have. I think it was a good movie. It wasn't a lasting one for me.",1392508800,13,2149,4.5
5441335,4,B00AJEL71S,"I really enjoyed this film. It's classic anime, with an enticing story and great animation. Both thee original Japanese track and the English dub track are worthwhile.",1392422400,,167,5.222222222222222
5441336,5,B00AJEL71S,"Wolf Children is a heartbreaking, beautifully done movie that will soon be regarded as a classic. The voice acting, art, and music blew me away, and the story, slice of life with a twist, easily keeps the viewer hooked and shows us the struggles of the family.

Everything worked great! Item was exactly as pictured. CDs had cute art of the Wolf Children on them. I've only watched the regular version so far, but it ran smoothly without a hitch. The english dub is extremely well cast. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Wolf Children or anime in general.",1392163200,,566,4.495145631067961

I was alone and nobody to judge me, but my dog was giving me some looks and I chose to not show weakness and loose my status and the alpha of the relationship. I would however, highly recommend this film if you liked any of the directors previous work (summer wars, the girl who leapt through time). Let the tears flow.",1392076800,,421,4.023809523809524

5441343,5,B00AJEL71S,"This movie was truly beautiful in every way. I loved the animation. The characters were great, and the story was beautiful. I loved this movie. There were so many moments that overwhelmed me with how cute they were. The kids were so adorable, both in their human and wolf pup forms. The kids had the cutest personalities that got a lot of laughs from me. I honestly wasn't expecting how funny this movie would be, but it had a lot of great funny moments. I watched this movie with my mother (who doesn't normally watch many animated films), and she really enjoyed it too.

I already knew the story before I watched the movie, so I often knew what was going to happen, but nevertheless, this film still managed to keep me quite enthralled with what was going on. There were some really heart wrenching moments that had me getting watery eyed whether I knew it was going to happen or not. For the most part, it has a pretty mellow story, but it's so touching that it's hard not to like it. Plus, movie is very character focused, and the characters do a very good job of keeping the story going at a good pace since they themselves are the story.

I really liked this film. It had couple flaws. Overall, I felt that the flaws were few and far between. This movie is an awesome experience. Especially if you like animals, then this movie will be hitting your cute buttons a lot.",1391990400,,1374,4.405511811023622

5441346,2,B00AJEL71S,"My daughter who is 12 and loves these types of movies and myself (mom) watched this one.
The beginning of the movie was very unnecessary, I think. The part when the kids were little, was very
cute. I love how they changed back and forth. Very cute.
But, after that, it went downhill and the end was very disappointing.
We had watched another movie by the same place who made this one, called Summer Wars and
that one was great!! Best cartoon movie I ever saw. So we were excited to see this one.
Not the same at all. But, just our opinion. My daughter really didn't like it at all. I'd rate it a 3, my
daughter said 1, so we made it a 2 to compromise!",1391558400,12,651,4.09375
5441347,5,B00AJEL71S,"If you're a fan of dramatic animes, you'll want to get this immediately! The story is an interesting blend of 'real life' drama and fantasy.

5441348,5,B00AJEL71S,"After being overdosed on the too-often saccharine and tossed-off fare offered via streaming video, this was a great change of pace. Doesn't pull punches w regard to treatment of the sometimes tough realities of, well, life--a parent dying, sad/difficult aspects of growing up--but yet has a lot of heart, fine animation, characters with growth, laughs, characters overcoming challenges...good stuff.",1391472000,2,399,5.779661016949152
5441349,5,B00AJEL71S,"When life takes a heartbreaking, sudden turn, Hana a young mother of two young 'unique' (to say the least) children must move out to the country to raise them. Along the way, Hana must rely on her own perseverance to survive as well as learn to accept that no matter what comes your way, as long as you smile and try your hardest, things will be alright.

I was nervous about the dub (I grew up in the era of 90's anime dubs, which were always awful) but it turned out that Funimation did an amazing job.
The wonderful voice actors actually made the movie MORE emotionally connecting than it already was in it's original language.

Touching, beautifully animated and brimming with wonderful morals about finding yourself and not quitting when the world turns on you, Wolf Children will always be my number one recommendation for anyone. It is an amazing story for anyone (thought younger children should probably not be shown it because of ONE small suggestive scene).

Also, for every girlfriend who took their boyfriend to see BRAVE and had them say 'I just can't relate to a mother and daughter story': this is your revenge. My male friends usually end up calling their mothers to tell them they love them by the end.

5441352,4,B00AJEL71S,"In truth I'm really torn between a 3 and 4 star for this movie.  I did enjoy it--I thought the art was beautiful, there were some good themes on growing, and it was a pretty bittersweet story.  However, at the end of the movie I felt as though the story was unfinished.  I won't spoil anything, but I was disappointed where it left off, and felt as though the story and its future 'consequences' weren't explored.

Honestly, I think I went into the movie wanting more than what was offered.",1391385600,,490,4.411111111111111

First, it is very long for a children's movie. Second, the story is very grown up and the kids asked many questions during the movie and were sometimes confused. For example, when the mother was pregnant and having morning sickness.
I liked the ending and it made all sense. My older daughter wanted to see it again while my younger one said that's a movie she would watch only once. It doesn't have the typical funny lines in it you see in kids movies. But as I said, beautiful pictures and the story itself is amazing.",1391299200,,661,4.338709677419355

It's truly remarkable to see how the story makes you feel for the family's difficulties that they face.

5441372,4,B00AJEL71S,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my twin sister. She loves wolves and really likes anime as well, so it seemed perfect. It was nice that it was not a huge romance movie or anything. It mainly focused on all the laughs and tears that the mother went through raising her two unique children. Though it is a fantasy, it is realistic. You watch the mother and her children deal with real problems that most of us can relate to, except with the added difficulty of making sure your children behave ""like people"" when in public. You just want to see more of their lives, how they deal with things. My mother watched it with us, and she is not an anime fan or anything. Nonetheless, she thought it was interesting. I highly recommend for anybody, especially if you like wolves!",1390435200,,778,4.4475524475524475
5441373,5,B00AJEL71S,"I saw this movie a bit back then and I cried from joy and sadden. Once it was release in the states I just had to get it. It came on time, was in good con. and I enjoyed the dubbed version as much as the subbed. This is a great movie for the family but maybe for kids who are older ( 11 and up maybe) not b/c of bad language or gore; it's not a cartoon that can keep little children's attention for very long but still a very lighthearted film. If you are a fan of Summer Wars, I'm sure you'll love this too ( it's by the same director) warning: You will want to cry.",1390435200,,567,3.773109243697479

5441375,4,B00AJEL71S,"I liked how this animation showed viewers what life in a family is like, and for the wolf children to pick different two different lives. I loved the art work and the animation. I almost cried because it was so sad. Liked the storyline, but I wish the movie showed more of the wolf children's future. Overall, this movie was enjoyable to watch! :)",1390262400,,347,4.4375
5441376,5,B00AJEL71S,"I cried so hard and so many times while watching this for the first time! It's the heart warming tale of a modern day woman who must raise the two offspring of their half-wolf father on her own, figuring things out as she goes along. She never gives up and will do anything to do the best for her son and daughter. If you're a parent and/or love wolves, this is a sure-winner for you and your family!",1390176000,,400,4.141025641025641
5441377,5,B00AJEL71S,"I'm not sure what I thought this was going to be about, perhaps expecting just another run-of-the-mill supernatural anime about humans who morph into animals, etc. And despite thoroughly enjoying two of Hosoda's other features, ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" and ""Summer Wars"", I shouldn't have let some unfavorably review and a much too superficial synopsis cause me to pass over this one so blindly. But then I was just looking for something to fill a Saturday evening and actually chose ""Wolf Children"" as a last option. And so, I find myself now extremely thrilled to have made that choice. As Yuki says in the opening narration, ""you might write it off as a fairy tail,"" and that's probably what I may have been half-expecting, not ready for the most amazing experience of the whole week. Not sure what else I can say, other than: if you're looking for something to leave you mesmerized and deeply moved, then pick this one up by all means.",1390089600,,948,4.716867469879518

My sister was very happy about the gift. The movie is excellent but very long and has a scene in the beginning that's a bit shocking.,1390003200,,281,4.035714285714286

5441383,5,B00AJEL71S,"If you like Studio Ghibli, The Girl who Leap through Time or Summer Wars, than you will most certainly enjoy this movie. The story is one that everyone can relate to in some form or another in the fact that we all have to choose our own paths and that people can be cruel and gentle all at the same time. I would recommend this even for non-anime fans. There is one scene that could be interpreted as bestiality or furrie erotica but nothing is shown it is simply implied and in no way sexualizes the characters. The point is to show complete acceptance of another. I am Catholic as is my family so this brief scenen was startling but nothing to warrant a flag and something my family and I discussed after the film was over. My parents never liked anime, but after seeing this film, they grew more accepting. The sub is phenomenal and the dub is great too, but I felt as though the dub didn't carry the entire burden the characters did in the sub. I still recommend both. I hope you can give this masterpiece a try!",1389830400,5,1016,4.296875

5441389,5,B00AJEL71S,"I watched this and oh my goodness.. it is one of my absolute favorites! This is probably saying something really great about this film since I am picky about labeling films with the word ""favorite."" It has a wonderful story with cute, funny, touching.. and even at times sad moments. It really tells a great story about the rewarding struggle and joy of a parent and the love between parents and their children. There is a brief scene of partial nudity but it's really only a flash during a breastfeeding scene. This is a definite must have in my opinion!",1389312000,,555,4.56
5441390,5,B00AJEL71S,"This is truly my most favorite anime film. It has surpassed my previous favorite, Princess Mononoke. Wolf Children is a beautiful, heart touching movie for everyone, even non-anime fans. Hana, a young girl meets a man who can turn into a wolf. After marrying and having two Wolf children, the wolfman suddenly dies leaving Hana to care for the wolf children on her own. She faces many struggles beyond what normal mothers face since these children are wolves.

It's an incredible story, Funimation did GREAT with the dubbing and I am also very happy they kept Ame's original howl at the climax from the Japanese version. It is the PERFECT movie for just about anyone!! You will NOT be disappointed.",1389312000,,698,4.816666666666666

Hana is the perfect example of what a hard working mother should be and seeing how much she cared for her children and their necessities even after their father had passed on was just...wow.

I cried through this whole movie.
It was beautifully made, the music was nice, and the story really hit home. Though the problems they faced were a world away from anything I've ever had to deal with (obviously) I still felt able to connect to these characters.
The perfection of this movie was helped by the fact that all of the voice actors were perfectly chosen and amazing. The voices chosen for the kids when they were younger seemed perfect and only made the movie better.
I give this five stars because in one sitting it shot up to at least my top five favorite movies. I highly recommend it.",1388707200,,706,4.356060606060606

I fell in love with it instantly, and saw it immediately upon its Japanese release. I was eager for this film to come to the states and even more eager for its release. Money well spent on this movie, and I even plan to buy it for friends who also adored it. A lifelong story and about love and laughter, as well as real hardships encountered in life, although played through the story of a ""fairy tale"", this movie is right up there with Summer Wars and even has a close ranking with the Ghibli collection.",1388620800,,609,4.169491525423729

It wanders aimlessly at times and drowns in sentimentality. I feel like this was meant for people who idealize and long to become wolves. There isn't much else there for those who don't. I don't romanticize wild animals, so seeing one stand whimsically on a cliff while wearing a scarf and capped with blue human hair is not quite my jam.

There isn't much I can say that the people before me haven't already said. Amazing movie, perfect quality.

If I said one bad thing about the whole process, it's that my box came broken. The plastic piece that holds the two DVDs was broken off and the CDs were just sliding around in there case. Which is minor. But that's the only bad thing.",1388361600,,460,4.4

We ended up choosing this because one we are both anime fans and it sounded like a good plot. I never suspected that this movie would be so beautiful visually, and have such a powerful story.

This is definitely a must have for all anime lovers. My wife and I loved it. We did the 7 day rental, but plan on buying it as soon as possible. Great for all ages, there is one small scene of not even partial nudity, it's tasteful and does not even have the typical anime feel. My wife and I thought it was a great movie of love, loss and strength. We love it and will probably watch it many more times once we have children of our own.",1388361600,,733,3.9863945578231292

Of first I didn't know what I should think of it since I thought how can a women get wolf children. I was concerned that it would turn out to be a bad animal abusive movie since you hear of so many things of today and people get so many ideas of getting money these days. Well I made a choice to check it out for all of you. In fact after I watched it I had tears in my eyes for the story was not bad at all. It was so much feeling so much love so much well lets say its fantastic. I don't cry easy but this just brought me in different character rolls which I cant explain since I would ruin the movie for all of you. I just can say it was a sweet treat. I always enjoyed watching anime since 20 years and im 26 now and I think if we had more people that would let there children watch anime we would have less crime in our world more then letting them watch the children programs of today. Plus they would learn better things. Don't get me wrong, its great that we have these series but they changed over time, there more over being fun and not of showing our children what love and all the other real important feelings are about these days.

The fact that it is not a love story but a story of growth, learning, and overcoming the obsicals the main character faces just makes it all the better.

The story and artwork are stunning making it easy to become obsessed, and want to watch it every day. My family and I have older TVs and regular DVD players, but there's a winter/river scene in the middle of the movie that actually looks like it's in 3D!

There's so much this movie has to offer; parenting, helping neighbors, nature, farming, friendships, children finding their paths in life and a mother's love and determination. Highly recommended to everyone.",1388016000,,573,4.846938775510204
5441425,5,B00AJEL71S,"No, seriously. Don't be fooled by the summary on the back of the box. Chances are, by the time you're done watching this, you will be in the process of becoming a hot mess, stuffing your miserable face with chocolate/ice cream/the last shreds of your dignity/etc while your significant other makes vague comforting sounds and considers the possibility that the in-laws are not the only drawbacks to your relationship. There will also be a moment there where you think, ""oh dear lord, tell me he's not in wolf form when they... oh no! Oh nooooo"" and you will be somewhat disturbed until you realize that hey, at least he isn't a sparkly vampire biting the pillows in half. ""This is what pop culture has done to me,"" you will think. ""This is what we have become."" And then five minutes will pass and you will suddenly be sniffling and blubbering just as much as you did when you watched the first fifteen minutes of UP.

I like anime, so this movie was something I thought was great. Even the dubbing was good. The plot is thought out and I cannot think of a flaw. The characters are quite nice, they have their own realistic little quirks and weird things about them like people. This movie made me so happy and sad at the same time, I think it made me think more of what it would be like to have a fresh start and my own family. It gets your brain going and shows possibilities of all kinds. Hana, the mom is a great character, she feels very worn out, but she keeps going on for the sake of her children and the people who helped her and are around her.

5441452,5,B00AJEL71S,"I'm writing this review as an anime loving parent with children who enjoy Ponyo, Kiki's Delivery Service, and other films. I will try to avoid spoilers but I'd like to cover how child-friendly this film is and also who the intended audience appears to be.

Wolf Children is an animated film that is fairly wholesome, playful, and emotional, but I don't believe it was made for children. The scenes, especially with the children at a very young age, are adorable and sometimes laugh out loud hilarious, and I think children would love watching those scenes, but there is a lot more to this movie and that makes me believe it was written to be enjoyed by grown-ups and the target audience isn't your kids (like the audience for Ponyo for instance -- this isn't it.)

That's not to say that this movie can't be experienced by young ones too, however. As I said, I found it quite wholesome. The only bad language I caught after watching it twice was one off screen character saying ""damn"" once. There is also one scene involving Hana, the mother, collar bone and up but implied to be naked below that. It is dark and you see her love (in half man/half wolf form with full wolf face) lean up and then both disappear off screen. No nudity is shown but when adults see this, we obviously know what it is. Still, I don't think that one 30 second scene makes this untouchable for kids.

Also, there is a scene without blood, gore, or violence, that still implies death. So if you haven't covered that with your kids yet and think it might be a sensitive issue, maybe watch for yourself first and then skip that part.

So this movie is actually pretty clean for a modern day film, anime or otherwise. Yet, after watching it again and again, I still believe this movie was written for adults, for parents, for mothers and fathers. The emotional notes written in this film are aimed at those people and children just won't get some of it and definitely won't feel the emotional impact. I almost guarantee tears will spring to your eyes off and on throughout this whole movie and I can also guarantee, your kids will barely blink. It goes right over their heads.

The tone of the movie is sweet, pure, and serious, lacking the bouncy feeling other children's movies like Ponyo have or an uproarious musical score. The music is quiet and poignant and serves a subtle purpose. None of the characters are over the top either. They all behave like real people. The community in the farm country Hana moves to is a great character in itself, without focusing on any individual community member too much. The theme of community is held to be more important than the individuals.

This movie is about a mother's journey overall. I highly suggest watching this one, even if you're not an anime fan, but don't expect to be able to share it with your kids the same way you might have shared My Neighbor Totoro in the past.

I hope this review has helped. When I first purchased the movie, I searched everywhere for some hint at the content within so I could figure out if it was something I could watch with my kids the first time through without previewing it first. It turns out it's almost totally kid-friendly. However, this isn't a coming of age story for the Wolf Children as titled, it's a mother's journey, a parent's journey, a journey of the heart your kids, thankfully, are too young to quite understand.

I'm giving Wolf Children a 5/5 because it was so refreshing. It's a movie for grownups that doesn't have to have sex, violence, and cursing to stand out or proclaim itself grown up. It just is. And the story it tells is moving and relatable, especially as a parent.",1386720000,7,3659,4.550151975683891

 As for the children...well they are kids through and through no matter what form they are in. This was one of those that made me tear up in a few spots,especially towards the end. Kids have a hard enough time growing up in todays world yet these two have so much more to deal with. We get to see them cope....see them fail... try again and finally figure who they are and decide what to do with ""Their"" life. This was the whole story to me.

5441461,5,B00AJEL71S,"Far, far better than you think. Hana falls in love with the last remaining werewolf in Japan. They build a life together, and have two children until tragedy strikes. She flees with her two children, Yuki and Ame, and tries to live a quiet life in the rural countryside away from prying eyes. But raising two wolf children is harder than it seems.

This is a spectacular, beautiful film. It's documenting the life of a special family, and each shot and situation is done with care and heart. I found far better than Summer Wars, the director's previous work, and this without big action sequences or garish CGI. The two wolf children are absolutely adorable, and watching them grow up and deal with their nature is both heartwarming and sad.

I found the dub to be excellent. Young Yuki in particular was outstanding, but all the voices fit well and none grate. I'm often harsh on dubs, and prefer subs, but Funimation did a great job here. The Instant Video version was a great transfer even at SD, and the only minor issue I had was that on my setup, the music seemed a hair too loud compared to the SE. Considering that this sold for $10 when I purchased the SD version, it's an amazing value.

If you love anime, this is a no-brainer. Even if you don't, it has none of the usual anime cliches, and feels more like a Disney movie if made for and targeting adults. The digital version doesn't allow original Japanese voices or have any extras, but it's a criminally low price.",1386028800,52,1478,4.507462686567164

I encourage any fan of art, film, and anime to add all three of these gems to your collections and to follow Hosoda's career henceforth with gusto.",1385942400,,485,5.453333333333333

Mamoru Hosoda has done it once again! He has dragged into a world that looks so familiar, yet is so out of reach. It is an amazing tale about family bonds, learning to let go, and letting nature take its course. I recommend this film to Japanese animation lovers everywhere.

NOTE 1: I will say that if you have small kids, there is maturity to this story in the beginning, so be aware that this not a G film like with Miyazaki films. :)  The storyline is deeper than just your typical American children's tale and adults are more likely to get the true meaning/take away more form the film than a small child.

The case for the disk is another matter. I opened my DVD/Blue Ray case, and immediately the first DVD slid out. I thought it was odd but I assumed it was just knocked around during shipping.

5441467,5,B00AJEL71S,"Truth be told, I completely stumbled upon this movie while looking at episodes on Funimation's Youtube channel.  It was actually the trailer for Wolf Children on the sidebar.  After watching it, I was delighted to find that it had already been released over the summer of 2012.  Seemingly coming full circle, I discovered that the English Dub was released just recently as well.  Although it was a breadcrumb trail leading finally leading to the movie, I have to say that I am extremely grateful for seeing that trailer on youtube.  Suffice it to say, this movie is extremely well made.  Story, animation, values, lessons, all the above are incredible and I cannot recommend strongly enough that you should see this movie.

Getting into a longer review:
The movie is a slice of life story concerning a family of a mother and father and two children.  The mother Hana is a college student who falls in love with a man named Ookami.  After fostering their relationship, Ookami reveals himself to be really a Wolfman or Werewolf to Hana.  Rather than running in the opposite direction, Hana accepts Ookami's secret and they begin a family together.  They story takes off with their two children Yuki and Ame, both half human/wolf as well, as they live their lives and grow up together.  The story allows you to both connect with and grow with Yuki and Ame as they discover what life has in store for them.

The most touching point of the story (for me personally) is Hana's maternal determination to raise Yuki and Ame to the best of her abilities in an environment where they could follow whatever path they chose.  The struggles, the love, the work, and the determination demonstrated by Hana in this movie will leave such an impression on your heart that I wouldn't be surprised if you wanted to pick up the phone afterward and tell your own mother that you love and appreciate her.  Hana is a very powerful character, not through her looks or being aggressive, but by her love and her self-sacrifice.  These points add an emotional layer to an already great story.

The animation is spot on for the entire movie.  While I am not a very picky watcher at all in animation movies (I wouldn't be able to say what is bad or not really), I have to say that the art style and animation really caught my attention in many parts of the movie.  And it is not just during those very obvious scenes where it specifically draws attention to the scenery, but in several normal scenes where other things are going on or lines are being spoken, I found myself stopping and saying, ""Wow, this is beautiful.""

Voice acting, I thought, was excellent in both versions.  I know many people tend to prefer the Japanese dub with English subtitles, but after watching both versions, I enjoyed both very much.  Then again, I am not picky on this point as well, but it is up to personal preference I'm sure anyway.  But take comfort in knowing that both are very good and I don't think you're missing out in whichever you choose.

Concluding, again, I cannot recommend strongly enough that you should watch this movie.  If nothing else, I am sure you can find it to be a very entertaining story.  Animation is superb, voice acting is great, and the values focalized here provide great context to develop character and determination in all of us.

****One Note to make****  A point to bring up (as I have seen it in other places) is that there is bestiality due to the relationship between Hana and Ookami.  While a person could bring this up as a major point against the movie, I disagree that it should lower the rating of the movie.  Rather than seeing it as a negative, I view it as a positive.  My reason is that the relationship between Hana and Ookami is based on truthfulness and trust.  Ookami shows himself to be a wolfman to Hana and Hana accepts it without running away from or revealing him.  To me, it makes their relationship even more special.",1385424000,7,3933,4.6048850574712645

I truly believe that no matter what you're into, what your film preferences are, you will be totally immersed in the storyline. And unlike any other disney film, films like this don't rely on a princess or good vs. evil common story line to deliver emotion. Sure, it's got a cliche here and there, but it's all good.

5441472,2,B00AJEL71S,"**Warning: Spoilers!**

Although it was sweet and touching like everyone else says, there were a few things that ruined the overall movie for me.  The first (and worst) was the implied bestiality.  At one point the wolf-man explains that his kind came from the union of a human and a wolf.  Suspending the fact that that's scientifically impossible, it's also full-on squicky.  Also, there is a scene with implied nudity where it's also implied that Hana and her ""mate"" have relations while he is in a half-wolf form (man-sized, wolf face, covered in fur).  Brief, but I skipped it anyway (NOT for children, that's for sure).  If it hadn't been for that one, disgusting scene, I would probably have given this 3-4 stars.

Still, I was interested in the story (since I'd borrowed it), so I continued.  Hana gets pregnant, not sure if they ever got married, and later gets pregnant again (still not sure if they ever tied the knot).  Her ""mate"" dies due to an accident (which was quite heartbreaking), and she's left to raise 2 very small half-WOLF-children alone (she was in over her head, poor thing).  This next part is why I would give it a 3-4, not a 4-5 (again, if not for the bestiality).  She spoils them/doesn't properly discipline them (pet-peeve, since I have kids who were much more well-behaved at those ages).  She probably tries her best (she's very gentle, to the point of doing her children a disservice), but it still always bothers me.

I can't truly recommend anyone watch this (or buy it) b/c of the bestiality.  If it hadn't been included, it would've been a bittersweet tale of life, love, and motherhood.  However, the taint of that particular act was enough to ruin much of the film for me.",1380499200,35,1713,4.678929765886288

I will say this, I was lucky to be at Otakon in Baltimore when they premiered the English Dubbed version and let me just say it does not disappoint at all.  If you are a fan of movies related to this such as Summer Wars, Girl Who Lept Through Time, Miyazaki, or Shinkai.  This is a must have.  It is appropriate for all ages and I believe that all ages will enjoy.

5441474,5,B00AJEL71S,"It's hard to put this movie into a genre category, as it takes place over the course of many, many years, chronicling the life of the protagonist, Hana.  The movie contains action, love, pain, joy, difficult choices, impossible situations, and hard work.  I'd call it slice of life, except the movie covers a whole lot more than a ""slice"" of Hana's life.  It really is just a movie about life.

By the time you've reached this review, the premise will probably be familiar to you: A university student meets and falls in love with a man who is part wolf, and they have two beautiful children (who are, of course, named after the weather outside on their birthdays).  Due to the difficulty of having to raise two babies who can't yet tell the difference between being wolves and being human, the family relocates to the country and they start a new life there.  They must overcome a variety of harrowing challenges, such as having enough money to make ends meet, learning not to turn into wolves in front of people, growing crops on the new farm, and getting along with the other children in school.

For someone expecting a fantasy adventure, this is not it.  The only ""magic"" in the story is the fact that the children are wolves.  Yet the movie itself is inspiring, heartwarming, and surprisingly not sappy about the parents' love story.  The English dub didn't stand out to me, but that's because it fit so well with the movie that I almost forgot that it wasn't the animated characters themselves speaking the lines.  The voices themselves were hardly unique, but the emotive quality each actor brought to the movie was wonderful.  I unfortunately can't say anything about the Japanese dub, since the DVD isn't out yet at the time of this review and I had the privilege of seeing the movie with the English dub at Otakon.

The animation was the part of this movie that impressed me the most.  Fields, forests, and the city are all gorgeous, not to mention the characters themselves.  The fluid way the children transition between being wolves and humans is also great.  I would recommend watching this movie in HD, given the choice.",1379462400,45,2136,4.686327077747989
5441475,5,B00AJEL71S,"Wolf Children is by far one of my favourite movies, and being an anime fan my whole life, I've had the opportunity to experience a LOT of animation. This is definitely among the top! The story of a young mother who gives it all for her children is incredibly touching, and it's told through amazing visuals accompanied by beautiful music. I recommend it to everyone, whether you're an anime fan or not. I also recommend a box of kleenex and something to hug.

Due to it not being released in America until a year and a half later than in Japan, I too was one of the people who downloaded a fansub. But like other reviewers have said, please buy the actual DVD to support the creators! They truly deserve every bit of it.

This is an extraordinary film: gorgeously animated, a flawless mix of computer graphics and hand-drawn images, funny, surprising, and touching without being maudlin. It is very much a film for parents, both a literal fantasy, and an allegory about the challenges and rewards of raising your children. It's very hard to find anything bad to say about it.  I enjoyed The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, but Wolf Children beats it hands down.

We were privileged to see this film in the New People theater in San Francisco, as part of the Japanese Film Festival, so we got superb visuals and sound quality, and an environment allowing the film to receive our full attention.  It is to be hoped that the US BluRay and DVD will be of similar quality.  And I'll join my companion reviewer in recommending that, even if you see the film posted online, be sure to purchase a copy to support the creators.",1378944000,19,995,4.662857142857143
5441477,5,B00AJEL71S,"I heard about this movie on a furry board that I frequent. You don't often see stuff like this in anime, and as I do like anime already, I figured I'd give it a go. I was warned to expect it to be sad, but I went ahead and watched it anyway.

Wow, it didn't disappoint.

Firstly, you don't have to be into the furry fandom to enjoy this at all. It stands on its own right. The ""wolf children"" aspect aren't even incidental, either, but somehow were woven into the story as an essential plot device. The characters are instantly relatable and easy to care about. The children are absolutely adorable, and we get to watch them grow up from newborns to when they pass onto adulthood.

Yes, this story had moments where you wanted to cry. There were sad tears, but also many happy ones. This movie pulls at your heart strings so very easily that you cannot bring yourself to stop watching. After the film finished, I was left with such a mix of strong emotions that I couldn't stop thinking about the film for the next couple days. I had come to feel like I had a personal relationship with each of the characters, because I felt what they felt through every step.

The film ended on a happy/sad note. I know a lot of anime series and movies have trouble ending correctly. This one does not. It ends on such a note that you feel satisfied. It's a sad, happy, and hopeful parting, where you wish the characters well in the future and are thankful for all the times you had with them.

The message in the film touched me, as well. It encompassed a broad range of topics, from finding love, your purpose in life, dealing with unexpected tragedy, accepting responsibility, and overcoming obstacles against the odds. It also demonstrates how one lets go of the past while still honoring it, gaining independence, bravery, and acceptance of others. This is a deep film and I highly recommend it to anyone who feels the even remotely might be interested in the subject matter or medium.

The writers, director, artists, and actors did a phenomenal job with this film and story. It is truly a masterpiece that should be enjoyed for years to come.",1377820800,,2134,4.487113402061856
