7951745,1,B00005R1N1,I never liked him. He was not funny on taxi or anything else he was one. Why would watch him for 85 minutes? Watch george carlin instead!,1486252800,,137,4.111111111111111
7951746,1,B00005R1N1,"It's a very quick, very known documentry type flick. You don't get to see Andy in any full performances. Just youtube this to see the highlights. Saves time and money. Very disappointed.",1399593600,,186,4.84375
7951747,2,B00005R1N1,"this dvd could have been great. the concert footage is rough but clear enough, and the backstage interview is pretty funny. what kills it, though, are the constant interruptions by some jackass sitting in his backyard telling us why andy kaufman is funny. if you are into andy kaufman enough to buy what you think is gonna be an entire concert of his from his prime, you don't need someone to explain the humor. if you do buy this, get it used and get ready to do some fast forwarding.",1168992000,8,485,4.4
7951748,4,B00005R1N1,"As stated in the earlier review, there is hardly anything new here performance-wise for Kaufman fans; all the usual bits-Caspian Harvest Song, Mighty Mouse, etc-are here. However, many of those ""greatest hits"" had yet to find their way onto dvd. For example, performances of ""Oklahoma"" and ""This Friendly World"" had been featured on his VHS-only Carnegie Hall special but never on any dvd release, so that alone makes this one a treat. I also agree with the other review that a priceless backstage interview gives us Andy without any pretense-it's really him! Some amusing anecdotes from people that knew him in the 70's round this interesting though hardly groundbreaking documentary.",1008288000,14,685,5.236363636363636
7951749,3,B00005R1N1,"This DVD is good on a base level. On one hand, Kaufman does his usual routines we've seen in numerous videos (mighty mouse, wrestling women, etc.) and on the other hand this DVD features a GREAT interview with the REAL Andy where he's just being himself, not putting on any gimmics or hoaxes. This is the only tape/DVD where you actually get to see a glimpse of the man behind the wild hoaxes. The only problem is Seth Schutlz (Andy's friend and creator of this DVD) constantly buzzing in, sometimes right in the middle of an Andy routine which makes it frustrating. And during the wonderful interview. If you're gonna feature something new and original, don't spoil it!
This is good for any Kaufman fan for the interview alone, but other then that, the routines we've seen over and over make this tape nothing special.",1006128000,19,819,4.655172413793103
