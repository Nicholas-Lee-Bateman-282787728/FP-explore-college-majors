8378747,5,B002RH4Z32,"I have this version in VHS of Robert Irwin's remarkable story. I just wish someone would produce it in a DVD version. It's a gem, beautifully made, and an important record of Irwin's life and work. I think young artists, students of all ages and anyone interested in art will find this film invaluable and inspiring.",1355788800,,316,4.660714285714286
