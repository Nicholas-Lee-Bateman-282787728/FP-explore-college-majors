2756446,5,B000N4RARE,"Good Double Feature.  Major Payne is one of those movies you can watch over and over again year after year and laugh like the first time.  St. Bilko, while not as good as the original, is still funny.  The two movie combination is a great value for vacations, car trips and an easy pick for the rained out soccer game alternative.",1257120000,,330,4.377049180327869
