8427138,4,B004EL5NH6,"Speaking of the film, 'Baaz' is one of the most entertaining adventure films of the 50s. However, some may feel that it's a little too anti-Portuguese. While it moves at a very fast pace, it does not feel rushed. On the technical side it does not disappoint, especially the brilliant cinematography deserves special mention. The songs are very pleasant (but it's funny how uninvolved the extras look in the song sequences as they mouth the lyrics like zombies) and the choreography is mostly dazzling (for the fight scenes and the dances).",1301097600,,539,4.934065934065934
