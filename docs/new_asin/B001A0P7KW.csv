8275747,5,B001A0P7KW,"Great product, and excellent service in delivering it to me! It was well-advertised, honestly presented, and promptly delivered. I am 100% satisfied with this product, and based on my experience, recommend them to anyone else who is interested in something they offer. My thanks to the people who made it available.

This is the 7-part seminar by Kent Hovind that I first purchased back in 2002 or so when I saw him speak at a church in Pensacola. I was really happy to find it on amazon, in practically brand-new condition! I was looking for a dvd set of the series from before when Eric Hovind decided to edit the series and take out the parts where Dr. Hovind preaches against the New World Order, illegal IRS, etc. I was very disappointed when the rest of the Hovind family decided to grovel before the tyrants who were persecuting their own leader. So for anyone else who is looking for a professional set from before this betrayal took place, this vhs set is just what you are looking for!",1394668800,,995,4.589887640449438
