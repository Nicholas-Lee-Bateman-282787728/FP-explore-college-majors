8355055,4,B0027RE0N2,"A nice collection of films for Mustang, and a great Mustang flight manual.

Cons:
1) Six films but only 5 are on the dvd menu. The 2nd Italy video ""Air Attacks Against Italy"" is on the DVD but not the menu.
2) The bonus video ""Luftwaffe Finis"" is produced by Zeno's Warbird Video, marital background music, just 11 minutes, no narration but quick clips of ""printed information"". The contents is not startling, but interesting if you like watching clips of a half dozen notable Germans who were involved with the Luftwaffe, but the clips of allied servicemen inspecting captured famous German fighters is interesting (not startling).
3) If you know the Mustang you also know of their service in the Pacific, especially escorting B-29s over Japan.
There is NO mention of this notable Mustang combat theater. Disappointing.

Pros: Excellent coverage of Europe action, includes clips of the P-47 and P-38, focus is on the Mustang however.
1) Great gun camera clips of dogfights and ground strafing.
2) Great coverage of Italy (remember to view Italy flim #2 on your pc, file VTS_01_2. VOB).
3) Great coverage ""A Day with the A-36 Invader"", P51A's in Italy
4) ""Flight Handbook for the P51-D Mustang"" is a prize.

Overall a nice addition to any WW2 video library.
Also recommended: ""Classic U.S. Aircraft Of WWII - P51 Mustang"" dvd, here on AMazon.

DVD menu with #6 film missing is included.",1471910400,,1386,4.860169491525424
