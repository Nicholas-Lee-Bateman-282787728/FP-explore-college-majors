5721965,4,B00CGCKFH8,"I've always enjoyed Tarzan films, including watching Johnny Sheffield grow up, so was interested to see how he did in the 'Bomba' series. They are rather pedestrian, and the camera-work is very much of its time, but Sheffield makes an acceptable jungle boy, and the pretty heroines wander and get lost, and scream in all the right places. Picture and sound quality are good. I doubt I shall watch them again, but nice to have seen them once.",1384300800,,441,4.666666666666667
5721966,4,B00CGCKFH8,This DVD set has the first six Bomba movies on them.  This was a great series based on a jungle boy's adventures.  This is a great series for those who like Tarzan.  To bad the series had only 12 movies in the series.  Great morals for the youger people who watched them.,1383868800,,271,4.153846153846154
5721967,4,B00CGCKFH8,"Not great movies but they bring back a fond memory of watching these at the local theater when a boy. What helps make these fun are the supporting actors like Don Harvey & Myron Healey who play the troublemakers. These are sort of a B movie version of the better Tarzan movies. But, as I said, they are enjoyable for what they are.",1379030400,2,331,4.26984126984127
5721968,5,B00CGCKFH8,"I stumbled upon this collection of movies by accident and was hesitant to pay as much for a seemingly goofy collection. I was wrong; although the writing was not complex, the movies were very entertaining and the acting (in my opinion) was far superior to the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies. The clarity of the movies are great and surpass what I expect from 1939-1941 films that have not been re-mastered. It is well worth the experience to view these and I hope the remaining movies are released as a second volume.",1374451200,,519,4.714285714285714
5721969,4,B00CGCKFH8,"I remember seeing some of these movies when they came out, they were funny and campy.  They are even funnier today abd bring back many great memories from my youth.  It's amazing how little it took to entertain me back then. These must have been high budget features to produce, perhaps as much as $500 or $600 each.  I can't wait until the volume 2 set of 6 features are released.

5721970,5,B00CGCKFH8,"Warner Archive has done it again with another great collection of b-movies featuring the fast-paced jungle adventures of Bomba, the Jungle Boy portrayed by the wonderful Johnny Sheffield. This set collects the first six Monogram films, and, hopefully, there will be a Volume Two collecting the final six Bomba films.

These low-budget, but very cool, jungle films are based on the popular young people's ""Bomba, the Jungle Boy"" books by Roy Rockwood that were published from 1926 to 1938. There were 20 books in all. The first series of 10 books had Bomba in South American settings, and the second series of 10 books placed Bomba in Africa.

Johnny Sheffield was from a show business family and he began his acting career as soon as he could walk. His big break as a child actor came when he was selected from hundreds of candidates to play ""Boy"" along with Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan in ""Tarzan Finds a Son"" (1939). He played Boy until her outgrew the role and was released from his contract in 1947.

Eighteen-year-old Sheffield was perfect for the role of Bomba, and Monogram Studios was more than happy  to sign him to star in its series of Bomba pictures that would span 1949 to 1955.

This collection does not have any added features, but it does boast excellent picture quality and sound. These films have not been seen in many years on television, so being able to enjoy them now is a real treat for b-movie fans, and especially fans of the jungle film genre.  Aside from a few scenes of jungle violence, these films are basically family entertainment.  They are as follows:

1. Bomba, the Jungle Boy (1949, 70 min.): This film introduces the viewers to Bomba and gives a few details about his origin. A photographer and his perky, blonde daughter come to Africa to film jungle wildlife. The daughter is played by 17-year-old Peggy Ann Garner. She wanders off from camp one day and gets lost in the jungle. Bomba saves her from a killer lion and takes her to his secret mountain paradise located in a hidden part of the jungle. Peggy soon becomes a little too fond of Bomba and his home.

2. Bomba on Panther Island (1949, 76 min.): Bomba befriends the sister of a headstrong contractor who has come to the jungle to build a large plantation. There's a rogue panther on the loose that is terrorizing area villages, and Bomba is determined to find him before he kills again.

3. The Lost Volcano (1950, 67 min.): Bomba becomes friends with a young boy and is giving him lessons about jungle life.  The boy's father is in the jungle to conduct some scientific research. Meanwhile, some greedy jungle guides kidnap the boy and try to force him to lead them to a treasure in a legendary lost city near an active volcano. Cult favorite Elena Verdugo is the boy's beautiful and courageous companion who, with the help of Bomba, leads the boy's parents to their son and the lost city.

4. The Hidden City (1950, 71 min.): Bomba helps a beautiful young woman who has lost her memory. It is later revealed that she is the daughter of a territorial governor who was assassinated by an evil Emir who is now overseeing her father's jungle territory with an iron hand.

5. The Lion Hunters (1951, 75 min.): A lion trapper and his daughter come to the jungle to track down lions so they can be sold to zoos. Bomba uses his wits to save his lion friends and to disrupt the hunters' plans. Eventually, Bomba wins over the cute, petite daughter by showing her that lions are social animals and that it's inhumane to separate them from their own family groups or ""prides."" She then works with Bomba to save the lions.

6. Elephant Stampede (1951, 71 min.): Bomba and some villagers are being taught to read by a devoted, older teacher and her lovely, young assistant (who happens to have a crush on Bomba). Later, some bloodthirsty ivory poachers arrive. They intend to force Bomba to help them find a cache of ivory that is said to be hidden deep in the jungle. This Bomba series entry has a lot of fast-paced action, and there is an interesting focus on the importance of education. This is my favorite Bomba film in the collection.

Thanks, Warner Archive, for making Bomba, the Jungle Boy available once again. Let's hope Volume Two will not be far behind.",1368921600,27,4266,4.624338624338624

5721976,3,B00CGCKFH8,"Back Lot productions, stock African footage when needed, and actors who can't make the dull dialogue and stilted conversations plausible. It's all very campy.
If you want to see the very cute Johnny Sheffield running around with little on, this series is for you. (Definitely a potential stud for Hollywood but he left the industry after the last Bomba film in 1955, got a degree and went into business, dying in 2010 of a heart attack, aged 79).  At the end of the Tarzan series, ""Boy"" was speaking English fairly well but here, he seems to have reverted to guttural two word responses in his attempt to speak English.  Living with apes puts a crimp on conversation I guess.",1400803200,2,675,4.663865546218488
5721977,5,B00CGCKFH8,"Johnny Sheffield starred in the BOMBA series of 12 B&W movies, after he grew too old to play BOY, THE SON OF TARZAN. These films didn't have a big budget, but they are all entertaining and fun, particularly if you like Tarzan and jungle adventures. Some films are better than others, and some feature very interesting leading young ladies such as Peggy Ann Garner, one of the best child stars in her day, and Elena Verdugo, a Latino beauty who was also leading lady for Gene Autry's westerns. These little jungle adventures are treasures, and the only thing I regret is the quality of the picture; these films need and deserve to be restored. I still give the set 5 stars for the importance of this collection and the pleasure it gives me to revive those unforgettable hours at the local movie theatre. It is a must if you are a Tarzan fun! By the way, this is the ONLY SET AVAILABLE to watch Johnny Sheffield's BOMBA FILMS No. 1 through No. 6. Give it a try!",1398556800,3,959,4.423728813559322

5721980,5,B00CGCKFH8,"Staring Johnny Sheffield, this series began after the demise of Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan movies. Adapted from the novels of the same name, Bomba was to last for only twelve movies of which two series were made.

Johnny Sheffield grew up in the jungle as 'Boy' in the Tarzan movies and loved the life so much Bomba was the next progression in his life.

In this series he saves lost people from the animals that most call wind. He also fights evil humans, fierce animals, meeting new people, saving young damsels from the wilds of the jungle or his jungle friends from the wilder animals. There are also reading lesons to attend or elephants to save from poachers to name a few.

The six movies from this series are: Bomba the Jungle Boy, Bomba on Panther Island, The Lost Volcano, The Hidden City, The Lion Hunters and Elephant Stampede.

Enjoy a five star series from a time long gone, of a boy who grew up in the jungle and knew his way around the tree tops just as agile as his monkey friends. Join him in this first of two series and see how he protects his domain from all manner of evil doers. It is on region free dvds so you not have to worry if it works or not. I don't think you will regret the choice.",1385596800,6,1215,4.315789473684211
