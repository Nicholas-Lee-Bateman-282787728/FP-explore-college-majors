It's a great story and a great movie.  Most people have never heard of it, but everyone should watch it.  Then again, maybe only the romantics among us should watch it.  Maybe it was the music, the chamber music, or maybe it was the darkening gray skies of Venice herself.  When I was younger, I thought it might have been Florinda Bolkan, but no.  It was the movie itself and the story that went with it.  I'm really not here to review it altogether, just to announce my loyalty to this movie forever.",1111622400,5,646,4.325
