2647881,5,B000HWZ4E8,"The final two seasons of the Adventures of Superman are timeless fun for all who admired the talents of George Reeves and the rest of the cast. It is too bad that Reeves passed on right after the series. Thanks to these DVD's his spirit continues into the 21st century capturing a new legion of fans. I enjoyed the episode he directed. Only one funny moment out of the episodes. If you watch The Man Who Made Dreams Come True, the king was told to drive the car backwards at 10 o'clock at night. The king is actually driving the car in broad daylight!!!! I thought this was a well put together collection of Superman classics. THANKS WARNER HOME VIDEO FOR MAKING THE FANS OF THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN DREAMS COME TRUE WITH THE WRAP UP TO THIS WONDERFUL COLLECTION!!",1163808000,12,766,4.478571428571429
2647882,4,B000HWZ4E8,"Completing the collection of ""The Adventures of Superman"", the series' final two seasons offers a mixed bag, for viewers; while some episodes are laughably bad (offering up green-haired, midget Martians, a mind-reading mule, and Professor Pepperwinkle's latest goofy inventions), some are, in fact, surprisingly good (tales of the search for a Civil War-era coat, a missing circus elephant, and a barber who reforms his childhood friend, now a gangster, are all very sweet, and quite enjoyable), and one of the last episodes filmed, ""The Perils of Superman"", directed by George Reeves, himself, is a bonafide 'classic', with unsettling images of helmeted criminals walking the streets of Metropolis, and Clark, Lois, Jimmy, and Perry, each subjected to silent movie cliffhanger demises. Best of all, these last episodes prove that Reeves, though far heavier and grayer by the series' end, never lost the sincerity or humor he had displayed in earlier seasons...Playing the Man of Steel may have been the ""Kiss of Death"" for his career, and, possibly, his life, but he never gave anything less than his best, and it shows!

There are moments worth savoring, in viewing the episodes; for Lois at her sexiest, catch ""The Tomb of Zaharan"", where the Daily Planet business suit is replaced by a tight-fitting 'Egyptian' costume and black wig (Noel Neill is surprisingly voluptuous, and HOT!)...in fact, the entire sixth season offers Lois with bright ORANGE hair, which she actually makes look GOOD...""Money to Burn"" is a throwback to the early seasons, with a bogus 'Fireman's Friend' mobile diner, and one of John Hamilton's best performances as Perry White; ""Whatever Goes Up"" is 'classic' Jack Larsen, as Jimmy Olsen 'invents' an anti-gravity formula; and for sheer 50s pop culture shtick, catch ""Superman's Wife"", where a stereotypical, bleached-blonde policewoman 'plays' the Man of Steel's bride to help nab a gang!

Also included in the collection is a made-for-dvd celebration of Jack Larson, offering recent interviews with everyone's favorite 'Jimmy Olsen', Noel Neill, and a variety of the series' historians. While not 'in-depth', it is great fun!

The only 'negative' to the collection is the inconsistent picture quality, with the color density frequently changing; the original prints certainly could use some remastering.

While ""Adventures of Superman - The Complete Fifth and Sixth Seasons"" may lack the luster of the earlier seasons, fans of the show, and George Reeves, won't be disappointed...and if you aren't a fan, give the collection a chance, as you may become one!",1163808000,72,2587,5.302439024390244
2647883,5,B000HWZ4E8,"I'll keep this brief as I'm probably already ""preaching to the choir"" here.  However, just on the off-chance that there are a few of you out there who have never known the wonder of ""The Adventures of Superman"" television series, may I just say this: there has never been--and at this rate, it appears that there never will be--a greater, more heroic, more noble, and more enjoyable ""Superman"" in the history of the character, than the interpretation given to us by the late George Reeves.

And I'll give you my reason why I believe that with all my heart in a single word: balance.  George Reeves didn't play Kent/Superman as ""bumbler moron""/""hero"".  He played Kent/Superman as ""Hero Type A""/""Hero Type B"".

There is a marvelous bit of dialogue from the 1st (or was it the 2nd?) season--a bit I'll no-doubt mangle here--that really explains it all.  A small group of mobsters are discussing the difficulties of life in Metropolis.  Of course they mention Superman.  But then, one of them utters the magic lines that go something like this: ""Forget Superman.  It's that Kent guy at THE DAILY PLANET I worry about.  There's times that Kent and his typewriter scare me more than Superman.""

That simple speech seared itself into my little eight-year-old mind and heart for all time.  Imagine that!  The bad guys feared Kent almost as much as they feared Superman!  What a fantastic life-lesson to teach a boy: for all his amazing powers, the thugs were almost more scared of the ""normal guy who wasn't afraid to stand up for what's right"" than they were of ""...the amazing being from the planet Krypton, with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.""

And it was George Reeves and his courageous portrayal of Kent/Superman who made you believe that could be so.

Maybe that's why this cripple grew up to be a writer.  And every time I took on a bully--on the playground or in the corporate world--somewhere in the back of my mind I was thinking, ""Do the right thing, buddy.  Mister Kent might be watching.""

Yes, I recognize all the various narrative and production short-comings of ""The Adventures of Superman"".  But Reeves, in refusing to play Kent as a cartoon unich, gave the character of Kent/Superman a vitality that has yet to be equaled--CGI or no CGI.

And if that's not enough to convince you, the jaded and cynical, to invest in these DVDs, let me share with you one, last, marvelous memory: the first word my baby son ever uttered was, ""GO!"".  It was shouted with all the passion, glee, belief, and intensity a tiny heart could muster.  And it was shouted as my son watched a black & white George Reeves make his famous running spring-board leap over the observatory fence in the classic climax of the episode, ""Panic in the Sky"".  And, in that instant, I knew what my baby boy knew--what all of us lucky enough to discover the magic and wonder of ""The Adventures of Superman"" at a tender age knew: George Reeves WAS Superman.

And he always will be.",1163116800,216,2972,4.680154142581888
2647884,5,B000HWZ4E8,"Many fans of THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN prefer the first 2 B&W seasons, and, quite unfairly, dismiss the color episodes as being lightweight and strictly for kids. This is NOT correct!! Although season 5 is probably the weakest of all of the 6 seasons, the final (6th) season contains several of the best episodes of the entire series. Episodes such as ""The Mysterious Cube"", ""All That Glitters"" and ""The Perils Of Superman"" are gems.

The glorious Technicolor work makes these episodes a joy to behold. They positively radiate with good humor, interesting plots and the so-obvious camaraderie of the best ensemble cast ever assembled.

Everyone should own these DVDs.",1160870400,58,668,5.1192660550458715
2647885,5,B000HWZ4E8,"I have posted lengthier reviews of this series on the other AOS boards, so I'll get right to some of my favorite episodes that appear on this collection:

By this time, the series was really formulaic. The innovative flying sequences of the first two seasons had been replaced with repetitive stock-footage of the same right-to-left shot. (In a cost-cutting move, when Superman has to fly in the opposite direction, the editor simply revereses the film, as evidenced by the backward ""S"" emblem.) The bad guys are really goofy, and the main actors seem to be going through the motions.

That being said, there are stil a few gems here.

""Superman's Wife"" is not as hokey as many of the other episodes in the final season. Joi Lansing is a knockout, and John Eldredge, as usual, makes one of the more interesting, intelligent villains.

""The Perils of Superman"" is pure FUN.

Noel makes for some NICE cheesecake in that proto-Jeannie outfit in ""The Tomb of Zaharan."" The story was pure cheese, though. (In ""Foghorn Leghorn"" voice: hey, I made a funny. Cheese--Cheesecake.)

""The Big Forget"" contains the greatest tease in the entire series: Clark changing into Supes in full view of all the series regulars!

The final shot of ""All That Glitters"" is really poignant, considering how things turned out for George.

The featurette about Jack Larsen is a nice little tribute.

Even with its faults, this is fun time with old friends that I now share with my grandkids. (All warm and fuzzy.)",1158969600,22,1485,4.83794466403162

*Taken from the book, Superman: Serial to Cereal; by Gary H Grossman

 You can read my review of Season 3 & 4, and see why I think these color  episodes are great fun for adults and kids. George Reeves was the most intelligent Clark Kent ever presented by Hollywood. It was George Reeves' input into this TV series that made Clark Kent an insightful, intelligent, almost detective-like character that one can still admire today. I saw these episodes when I was growing up in the late 1950's, and plan on buying this last set so that I can continue to laugh and cheer for Superman when he comes crashing through another wall just in the nick of time!",1157760000,39,1279,4.426008968609866
2647887,5,B000HWZ4E8,My favorite is The Magic Secret where Perry is yelling at Jimmy about going to a Magician's convension. I loved magic since I was a child.,1157500800,8,138,4.346153846153846
2647927,5,B000HWZ4E8,Purchased all seasons at once.  I remember this series fondly as a kid and I can still recall the newspaper reporting of Superman's death when George Reeves died.,1505088000,,162,4.785714285714286
2647928,5,B000HWZ4E8,"What a hoot!! I loved it. I watched this television series as a little kid. George Reeves was positively born to play the title role. The previously inconsequential journeyman actor brought the character to life with great conviction, charm and a wonderful enthusiasm which never faltered.
The characters were wonderful. It's still a delight to spend time with Jimmy Olsen, Perry White, and Inspector Henderson. I also love both Lois Lanes. The first Lois is all business and the second Lois melts my heart with that smile of hers! George Reeves is fantastic in each and every episode. George Reeves in my heart will always be the First and True SUPERMAN.

It was a marvelous treat to see them in color. Great clean fun to watch with my children (8&6). My little girl wanted color and was very happy when we started watching the color ones.

2648070,4,B000HWZ4E8,"I was six years old when The Adventures of Superman with George Reeves began in 1952. Naturally, I was hooked and watched all of them first-run. (Though I recall running around the backyard with a dish towel for a cape, I was never among those kids dumb enough to try jumping off the garage roof in an attempt to fly.)

Watching the episodes now, so many years later, its easy to spot the cheesy not-so-special effects, often ridiculous science in some of the plots, and even cringe at some of those plots (even the comic books often made more sense), not to overlook the fact that no one ever saw the resemblance between Superman and Clark Kent even with his glasses off. But the fact remains, if one doesnt examine the details too closely, the shows were fun, and everyone on screen took their roles seriously and played them straight, not like the later Batman series. Its clear from the music and lighting that they were going for a Saturday matinee movie serial experience but in 30-minute segments, and succeeded as well as they could in early television. And in this age where characters cuss a blue streak on TV as well as movies, its both funny and refreshing to hear Jimmy Olsen exclaim, Golly! and Jeepers! or Perry White shout, Great Caesars Ghost! when exasperated.

There were six seasons. The first season was the best, the most adult. After that, it seemed aimed more at kids. But as nostalgic fun, the whole series is hard to beat.",1435104000,,1448,4.608527131782946

2648090,5,B000HWZ4E8,"What I really liked about the ""Adventures of Superman- 5th and 6th seasons"" is that the picture seems to be clearer than the TV reruns. I watch it with my grandson (who is 3 yrs old), who also likes Christopher Reeves' version, enjoys watching with me and grandpa.  He is able to know there are many Supermans, so he thinks he can be a superman. My grandson is always asking who is the ""bad guy"", we tell him who we think is and he tells us who he thinks it is. Then at the end of the show, he is excited to see if he was right. In these ""Adventures"" the bad guys are not easily identified, because they can be nice looking people, they can be less attractive people, they dress similar, yet we have to watch their behavior to ""know"" who is good and who is ""bad"". Some of these episodes are a little too deep for my grandson, but we monitor the ones we want him to watch. Yes, we love this version of Superman and I think you may love it too. Here is another reason I enjoy the George Reeve Supermans is because he was a wrestler in his early days, a boxer and very athletic. In order to show him landing from flying, he was really jumping from a tall latter down ""solid landing"".  He also was into Judo and some of the martial arts, so it shows his athletic talent. Another interesting background on George Reeves is that he was strong, he was able to pick up two guys off the ground, not dummies, and carry them. You will see his natural strength in these episodes, not bad for a man in his late 30's and 40's.

2648097,3,B000HWZ4E8,"Last two seasons are here for your viewing pleasure. Completists will want 'em all. The shows are high-camp silliness but on that level they are enjoyable time-wasters. Grating episodes like ""Mr. Zero"" and ""The Brainy Burro"" abound in these final two seasons. Fortunately, the occasional good episode, like ""Prince Albert coat"" and ""The Mysterious Cube"" help offset the camp a tad. The actors could all play their respective parts in their sleep by this point, and it shows. It has a feeling of everyone just going through the motions that many series in their decline tend to exhibit. But hey! it's still Superman, and even at its worst it could be good clean campy fun. As with the earlier volumes, these last two seasons of the show look & sound good. The lone bonus feature is a segment on Jimmy Olsen, with reflections from actor Jack Larson and a host of other people in the industry offering their thoughts. This final volume is NOT the one to start with but it will almost certainly entertain younger tykes, and is worth its weight in gold to die-hard fans and those older collectors who fondly recall watching the series while growing up, either first-run or in syndication. 3 STARS for the last flight of THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN.",1423353600,2,1242,4.75462962962963

2648102,5,B000HWZ4E8,"This is the set that brings mixed emotions. The last 26 episodes George Reeves and company did prior to his death in 1959. The color shooting in all 52 they did covering those four 13-episode seasons is not only a brilliant example of clever foresight by producer Whitney Ellsworth and his staff ; but quite revealing when it comes to what Reeves had to go through while wearing that uncomfortable Superman costume. He didn't have the more modern synthetic material Christopher Reeve and those who followed were able to wear. There are many shots in these episodes that reveal a conspicuous sweat mark on Reeves' stomach area--due to not just the material of the costume, but the full-torso padding he wore under it to simulate a heavily-muscled look. George had to wear internal padding throughout the series, even though he stayed in shape and was generally athletic. The heat generated by the suit necessitated separate shoots for all ""Superman"" scenes with frequent breaks to allow Reeves to cool off. And yet, he never complained except one time--half-jokingly--about the ""union suit,"" as he called it. These final episodes also find Superman's tasks under heavier demand, too. Many times, he finds he needs help from a trusted scientist, who guides him in achieving things he'd never tried before--like dividing himself or melding into a thick metal cube to get through it. Superman's still good for the other stuff, too. He's still bullet-proof; always making wall-busting entrances; strong enough to manually pull up a bathosphere from the bottom of Metropolis harbor (from the inside); and even when weakened by a kryptonite ray, he can still levitate Lois Lane (Noel Neill) so her frame will keep the walls of an entrapping shaft from closing in on them, while Jimmy Olsen (Jack Larsen) conjures up enough bravery to climb up the enclosed walls to get out and re-direct the ray gun. The scripts remain well-written (David Chantler), with a dash of humor that's never campy or overdone. Well, Chantler does give Neill one corny line to do in ""The Last Knight."" Upon being told about visiting a club where the members all dress up like medieval knights, Lois responds: ""What woman WOULDN'T want to date three (k)nights in a row?"" And the final three episodes are directed by Reeves himself--including a finale that sees Jimmy get knocked out and dream he and Lois have picked up Superman's powers--INCLUDING flying! The sad part is that they (1.) could not afford to shoot full 26-episode seasons once GOING to color; and (2.) Reeves AND John Hamilton (Perry White) died just before they were about to go a full 26 in the fall of 1959. They'd planned to replace Hamilton to carry on the White role, but there was no replacing Reeves. There still isn't.",1420761600,,2760,4.91220556745182

2648106,5,B000HWZ4E8,"Here are the last two seasons of the series. The third and fourth seasons introduced us to color and also storylines that became much more kid-friendly. These episodes from 1955 and 1956 are much like the previous two seasons. Near the end of the last season you also began to see Reeves weary of playing the hero in red and blue. But still, it had some good episodes. In the first episode of the fifth season ""Peril in Paris"" we get to see Robert Shayne in a duel role. Some other good episodes were 'The Man who Made Dreams Come True', 'Disappearing Lois', 'The Town that Wasn't', 'The Magic Secret', etc. As I said in the third and season, there were still episodes where Jack Larson showed great comedic talent such as 'Whatever goes up', 'The Big Forget', and others.
Another recurring character is Professor Pepperwinkle played by Phil Tead who is a loveable absent minded professor. He is also the guest star in the final episode of the series 'All that Glitters'.
Some other highlight episodes are 'The Tomb of Zaharan' where we once more get to see Noel Neil in a great looking Cleopatra type costume showing off her great legs! We also have 'The Last Knight' with the only return of the great director of many of the first season episodes Tommy Carr who makes a real difference in bringing out the best in George Reeves.
There is also a somewhat silly but still entertaining episode 'Divide and Conquer' where Superman visits his friend professor Lacerene who shows him how to split into two persons, each having only half the power of the other. The very next episode 'The Mysterious Cube' has the good professor returning now to teach Superman how to go through a wall! These tricks were never repeated in any other episodes.
Another episode that stands apart from others is 'Superman's Wife' which guest stars the drop-dead gorgeous Joi Lansing who left us far too soon in her life.
The last three episodes were actually directed by George Reeves himself: ""The Brainy Burro, The Perils of Superman, and All That Glitters. Unfortunately the first (Brainy Burro) was not very memorable. But it makes up with one of the best episodes of the series 'The Perils of Superman' (arguably, of course) which is much like an old time serial adventure. And the last episode also directed by Reeves is 'All That Glitters' which shows us what may happen if both Jimmy and Lois have the powers of Superman. This final episode of the series also ends with the famous lines that seem to be perfect for the last episode: (Jimmy) Golly Mr. Kent, you'll never know how wonderful it is to be like Superman. This is followed by Clark's response and final line in the series as he touches his glasses, ""No, Jimmy, I guess I never will"".
As like most series, there are some bad episodes and most fans would say the fifth season episode 'Mr. Zero' is the worst episode of the series. However, I would disagree. Although it is a very, very silly episode it still has its good points. Mr. Zero is played wonderfully by actor Billy Curtis who was also one of the little men in 'Superman and the Mole Men'. I also happen to really like actor Herb Vigran who plays Georgie Gleep. Actually, I would put the episode 'The Stolen Elephant' or 'Close Shave' in that category myself.
Whatever you might think about the series, every season had some episodes that were great entertainment for early television viewers as well as today's viewers. After all, there must be a reason why it's been around for such a long time and shown not only in the US but in many other countries all over the world.

2648127,4,B000HWZ4E8,"Adventures of Superman staring George Reeves is a very enjoyable and entertaining television show. Although season's 1 and 2 have better episode ideas, I like the following season's because of the color.  In the final Fifth and Sixth Seasons I would say the show is very good too watch, but not outstanding. For instance some of the topics of  the episodes seem kind of silly with teleporting through phone lines, temporality memory loss spray, a donkey that can read minds, having people floating in the air while in a laying down position, being invisibil while walking through walls, Superman splitting himself in half so he could be at two places at once, and probably some may not notice but some of the criminals in different episodes are the same actors. I was also a little disappointed that the last and final episode ever created focused on Lois and Jimmy and Superman only appeared during the last 3 minutes.

2648140,5,B000HWZ4E8,"The Adventures of Superman (TAOS) is a TV show that, by now, you most probably either love or loathe.  I consider it a treasure, an artifact of the fun early days of television, and of the fun days when comic books were cheap and didn't take themselves too seriously.  I am one of those people who look upon George Reeves, Noel Neill, and Jack Larson as old and trusted friends.  And I am one of those people who feel that for some inexplicable, magical reason, an over-the-hill, struggling actor gave the best performance ever as the real man of steel.

This is the better of the two color collections.  To those who dislike the 'goofy' episodes of the series, the stories which feature child-like Martians, or intelligent mules, yes, to your displeasure, there are goofy episodes in this set.

In defense of the goofy episodes: at the time when this series was produced, there were plenty of goofy stories in the Superman comics...probably about 20% of the stories were goofy in emphasis.  Additionally, many of Superman's more dramatic stories contained goofy elements and gags.

Finally, concurrent with Superman's stories in Action Comics, Superman magazine, and World's Finest Comics, Jimmy Olsen had his own magazine, in which Superman was of course a regular guest. About 90% of the Jimmy Olsen stories were goofy.  The point is, goofiness was part of the mythology in the 1950's. And if you look at the state of the world today, maybe we all need a little more goofiness.

Better news for everyone is that this collection features a number of dramatic and science fiction stories that aren't intentionally goofy at all, considerably moreso than the season 3 and 4 collection.  One of these features the sensational and off-the-chart sexy Joi Lansing, as a policewoman who 'marries' Superman, and of course this collection features 'The Perils of Superman,' which is one of the most comic-book-like episodes of all.

Whitney Ellsworth, the producer of this series, worked with Superman editor Mort Weisinger on each season, choosing the stories and re-writing them.  Every episode contains a decent story, with some being excellent, and even sometimes poignant ('All That Glitters').

If you like the endless, mindless CGI and moody narcissism of the 21st century cinematic interpretations of Our Hero, you will likely dislike this collection or at least be perplexed.  But if you have fond memories of this show, then you will not be disappointed.",1379462400,,2456,5.014778325123153

Included in these last two seasons were the story of ""Mrs. Superman"" (a hot Joi Lansing); the eccentric ""Prof. Pepperwinkle"" and his gadgets; a town that completely disappears; men who materialize from King Arthur's day, and a lot more crazy stories.

The last episode was a real doozy with Lois and Jimmy both flying like Superman!

Not only is this DVD set recommened but so are the others. It's so good to have all these old episodes available on disc, and looking pretty good with interesting bonus features, too. Kudos to Warner Home Video.  Great stuff!",1266969600,,750,4.525925925925926
2648179,5,B000HWZ4E8,"I give this five stars for its sheer existence and faithful historic entertainment quality. By this time you're read many reviews so lots has been said... there's no point in rating this set based on the acting/story lines etc. as it is what it is ---- a classic show from an age long, long past. WB didn't even exist back then, they simply own the rights to the original prints now. It's a show that in perspective tried hard to give as much quality and entertainment as was possible in that era, while still allowing the writers and directors to do some fun and creative things. And it worked---many of the shows are still entertaining and are great for family. Not so arguably much better than a large percentage of TV today and much cleaner.

No, the fact that they went through all the effort of doing the set, providing quality packaging, and when it really comes down to it they did a right bang-up job getting this transferred to DVD. People, this was done at the dawn of TV and even color movie film technology was fairly new and uneven.

You wouldn't want to digitally over-enhance the original prints from something from this era, take out all the scratches, sharpen it, etc because then it's not real anymore, you're putting in information that just wasn't there. It would be sanitized and it would lose its sense of time and place. The majority of the reproduction is simply superb for its age. I'm amazed that they could even salvage the prints from that era. Not only did they recover most of the original stock, but so much of it is absolutely superb and nearly flawless. The shots in Perry's office are so sharp and clear, you can see individual hairs on people's heads for example. You feel like you are actually in the 1950s and you literally see it through the lens of the best color technology of the time.

This is such an outstanding set because the reproduction is true to the era. They really did restore to the highest standard the original quality and color reproduction for the technology that was used to film the series. This is evident in some of the scenes where clearly the same original stock film that they used for most of the episodes must have been damaged, and they were forced to go for a few seconds or even a few minutes to a reproduction from another set of prints, clearly several generation copies that were probably used for television broadcasts that had not been on as high quality media. Think of it as ""switching to what people would have seen on TV for a few moments.""

The second-rate footage is cloudy, shows color bleed, and has greatly reduced sharpness. It's an A/B comparison for the viewer, and it really brings out a gasp when you jump back to the section of what must have been the ""original"" stock that was shot... and then you realize how lucky we are that there is ANY footage of that outstanding quality that survived 50 years! Also great that WB was able to splice the lower-quality footage in pretty seamlessly, the audio is unaffected, the video changes instantly with an occasional flash.

This set gets an A+ because WB did their job---they gave to the world to the best of their ability the ""original Superman"" that the original producers would have dreamed of---showing George Reeves and all the original episodes in a quality and clarity, and this is important---that NO PERSON HAS TO DATE EVER SEEN in any form.

I watched the series in reruns on Boston's channel 27 as a kid in the early and mid 70's, and it never looked remotely as good as it does on these DVDs.

And yes, due to the original material it does range, over all six seasons, from superb B&W film-noire to campy near Gilligan's Island style goofiness, but on every disk there are episodes of merit to entertain and even to teach. And there's Clark's ever present twinkle and knowing grin.

Thanks, WB for doing it justice and for giving it back to the world.",1265068800,4,3897,4.565092989985694

Sure enough, with this purchase, one of my favorite episodes where Superman walks through a sealed vault to capture a crook who was in hiding waiting out his 7 years 'staute of limitations' to beat the rap was in this series.  Of course, Superman never actually walks completely through the wall, but he hears enough conversation to understand the plot.  He works with the authorities to have the official Naval Observatory clock turned back 10 minutes so that when the crook, with the help of his brother, steps out of the vault, he walks into the open arms of the waiting police 10 minutes early instead of 10 minutes late!

Sadly the final 26 thrilling episodes comprising of seasons 5 & 6 of ""The Adventures of Superman"" in color have come to an end and Superman has hung up his cape, hopefully not for good. Warner Studios has done a really nice job with the final installment of ""Superman"" and I'm glad I own this amazing DVD set. Once again it appears that very little restoration went into this release as the episodes do suffer from dirt, debris and scratches especially in the stock footage segments. The final 26 episodes presented in color are spread out over 5 single sided discs with great artwork and packaging. I don't know if this series will ever see a completely restored release for DVD, but until then I'll have my season sets to watch over and over. Thanks to Warner for this release and thanks George where ever you are, you will always be the man of steel to me.

2648196,5,B000HWZ4E8,"There are two types of ""The Adventures of Superman"" fan.  Type one is folks like me who grew up with the original series.  By the time I was old enough to appreciate Superman, the show was well into syndication. There will never be a better Clark Kent than George Reeves.  I atually liked the Clark bits better than the Superman bits.  Why directors persist with the clutzy Kent personified by the Chris Reeves version, I have no idea.  Given that seasons 2 to 6 were simpler and less violent plot lines (and as a result somewhat cornier)Clark's character was a lifeline for me.  He was never corny.  This kept the series' feet on the ground as comic relief (often dreadfully painful to watch) became the norm.

This brings me to type 2.  Those who wouldn't identify with the series as part of growing up with it but as Superman officianados, would see the series as a 'time capsule'. This is how I justify to my kids (now grown) my fascination for George and Co.

Regardless of what type you may be, the collection is worth owning.  It is beautifully presented, the reproduction is excellent and makes you feel damn good watching it and reliving that period of our culture.  From the opening, ""look...up in the sky..."" I always hunkered down in the seat expecting a good time.  Maybe it's me but it still delivers.

Look closely at his acting and the dual roles and interpretations of Clark Kent/Superman. You will begin to see that this was no ordinary man that was blatantly selected to put on those famous tights and go through the motions for 6 years. No, What makes the Adventures of Superman is the Magnetic appeal of that Great actor George Reeves. He convinced a whole generation  that He was Superman! that it was not cool to be a crook. He became the personification of Superman! He is now beloved throughout the World!

2648198,5,B000HWZ4E8,"Adventures of Superman began production on its last two seasons (that aired during 1957-58), the series more or less had overcome its tight budgetary restrictions by evolving into a veritable universe unto itself. And it was a wacky universe indeed, operating under its own screwy story logic often totally disconnected from any semblance of reality. That gangsters would watch their bullets bounce off Superman's chest then, having emptied their cartridges, throw their empty guns at the superhero, as if that would stop him, or that Superman's pals never seemed to realize that the Man from Kypton and mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent were one and the same, mattered not one iota to its legion of young viewers.

For fans of the comic books, the big-budget movies and TV shows of recent decades, Adventures of Superman rightly appears quaint and at times depressingly cheap, but if you stick with it, chances are you'll find that it has a peculiar but very real charm all its own. This year's Hollywoodland, about Superman actor George Reeves' last years as a struggling actor and a private eye's investigation following Reeves' death (barely a year after the last show aired), adopts a curiously contemptuous attitude toward the show and especially its fan base. Though young children took its wild stories at face value, for many adults the very charm of the show is its good-natured goofiness. Adventures of Superman is one of the most iconically '50s/Eisenhowerian programs of its era. Superman was, after all, fighting not only for truth and justice, but also for ""the American Way."" Instead of super-villains like Lex Luthor, Superman's foes were more likely to be communist types, and ironically enough union activist Robert Shayne, the actor who played Superman's ally Inspector Henderson of the Metropolis Police, was during its run subpoenaed to appear before The House Un-American Activities Committee and nearly lost his role were it not for members of the cast and crew who rushed to Shayne's defense.

A wonderful example of this very '50s tone is ""The Atomic Captive,"" a Cold War masterpiece. After Russian fifth columnists fail to bring back a Russian-immigrant nuclear scientist (and loyal naturalized American citizen), Daily Planet reporters Jimmy Olson (Jack Larson) and Lois Lane (Noel Neill) drive out to the desert to interview him. However, the scientist is dying of radiation poisoning, and so ""hot"" his mere touch is likewise fatal. Jimmy and Lois rush in, and naturally ignore his pleas not to go near him, each pawing the man with reckless abandon.

When the scientist tells them they've just given themselves a fatal dose of radiation, all Jimmy can do is turn to Lois and say, ""Golly Miss Lane, I guess we're done for."" Making matters worse, they then drive out into the desert, taking a short cut through ""ground zero"" at a nuclear test site, wrongly figuring they wouldn't possibly reschedule that H-Bomb test they had flown out to cover in the first place. Well, they were wrong, and take the full force of a nuclear blast, just like Glenn Manning in The Amazing Colossal Man. How does Superman save the day? You'll have to tune in for yourself.

This complete lack of common sense on the part of Lois and Jimmy is used throughout these later seasons, apparently as a kind of shorthand to propel the narrative forward without the need for lengthy (and logical) character motivation. In ""The Perils of Superman,"" an imposing man in a lead mask (Michael Fox) shows up at the Daily Planet to grimly announce that he's devised fiendishly imaginative means to ""liquidate"" Lois, Jimmy, Clark, and Planet editor Perry White (John Hamilton). Within a minute or two after he leaves, Lois and Perry are blithely off to a meeting, business as usual. It's no surprise then that they're kidnapped the minute they get into Lois' car. Then again, if nothing happened to them, there'd be no show.

The budget precluded Superman actually performing feats as grand as ""changing the course of mighty rivers,"" but the production values on these later shows is better than those when the show began. Seasoned B-movie directors like Lew Landers and Howard Bretherton helmed episodes, as did star George Reeves, while instantly recognizable character actors like Jack Kruschen, John Banner, Cyril Delevanti, Laurie Mitchell, Billy Curtis (as Martian Mr. Zero), Dabbs Greer, and Joi Lansing populate episodes. Serial fans will likewise delight in such familiar faces as Dale Van Sickel, Tristram Coffin, I. Stanford Jolley, usually playing villains.

Video & Audio

Adventures of Superman: The Complete Fifth & Sixth Seasons in Full Color is presented in its original full frame format with episodes of varying quality. Opening titles on all shows tend to look awful, but the episodes themselves generally are very sharp with bright, super-saturated hues reminiscent of early two-color Technicolor. The series used the same shots of Superman leaping out of windows and in flight over-and-over and these modest effects were probably never color-timed with the new footage, hence they tend to stick out like sore thumbs. The mono audio is okay, with optional subtitles in French and Spanish.

Extra Features

The only extra is Superman's Pal: Jimmy Olson, a brief tribute to Jack Larson's charming performances throughout the run of the series. He's interviewed once again, as are Noel Neill and Superman historians Jim Beaver, Gary Grossman, Michael J. Hayde, and Jan Henderson. There's no mention of Reeves' untimely death anywhere on the discs, or anything about the various aborted attempts to revive the series in some form in the years that followed.

Parting Thoughts

Though the Adventures of Superman's scripts leave all logic at the door, stories in these last 26 episodes are pleasingly close in spirit to the light-hearted tone of that era's comic books. Neill's hair becomes almost phosphorescently orange and both Reeves and Larson have fleshier features, with Reeves' hair a little grayer and thinner, and Larson no longer the 19-year-old youth he was when the show began, but the youthful excitement that still greets the show remains unabated.",1173657600,18,6170,5.117179741807348

2648201,3,B000HWZ4E8,"Most who have reacquainted themselves with the now complete ""Adventures of Superman"" from television's golden age would likely agree that the series' fifth and sixth seasons were its weakest. By then most of the stories did not meet the standard set in the first and second (b/w) seasons. The show was always shot fast and on the cheap, but now a certain carelessness had also set in, such that you can almost watch these last episodes just to count the flubbed lines that weren't reshot. That said, the series never lost its playfulness, the obvious love the actors had for one another, and the respect for the kids in their audience. They did their work so well that they never dreamt they were making pop culture history that would endure for over five decades and counting. Finally, however, the show belonged to George Reeves, a fine actor who breathed affable life into a comic-strip character. For those of a certain age, George Reeves remains the definitive Clark Kent and the most endearing of all Supermen.",1172188800,17,1016,4.811428571428571
2648202,5,B000HWZ4E8,"Having been born in 1954, I vividly remember coming home from school and watching ""The Adventures of Superman"" every day. Naturally in the 1960's it was in black and white, but the stories with all their simplicity stuck in your mind and captured you imagination. With Seasons 5 & 6, I now have all 104 episodes of this great TV classic, and I still enjoy them all immensely. Each episode is a minautue movie with great baddies, and of course Jimmy, Lois, the Cheif and Clark Kent/Superman. A favourite is ""The Mysterious Cube"" and I think the menu is quite clever. Thats my opinion.",1172188800,3,583,4.615384615384615
2648203,5,B000HWZ4E8,"I encourage anyone who enjoys Superman and wants to relive a bit of your childhood in fun-filled nostalgia, to purchase the entire series of the ""Adventures of Superman"" (played by George Reeves); the full set of all the episodes consists of 12 packed DVD's (I got mine all at once in a 3-pack collection, saving a little $$).  This is your chance to view the ENTIRE Superman TV series, from the first episode to the last (prematurely ending with the death of George Reeves).",1171497600,2,475,4.654761904761905

2648205,4,B000HWZ4E8,"This was definitely an enjoyable DVD --- brought back many childhood memories.  Special effects were a bit cheesy -- but it was the 1950s and I'm sure they had a limited budget.  Some episodes were just downright silly (the green haired Martian, the Mule, Jimmy's and Dr. Pepperwinkle's inventions).  I agree with another reviewer (Mr. Schmidt) that more should have been done when transferring these films to DVD --- the light flashes were a bit annoying.  All in all, it's a nice collection to have.",1171324800,,501,4.858823529411764

WB should have done more when transferring these films to DVD. I realize

that old films are not perfect, and light flashes sometimes occur, but I

thought WB had the original films. Didn't anyboby verify that the

film-to-DVD transfer was okay before trying to sell these DVDs? I thought

that WB was supposed to be working from the masters!!",1170547200,5,415,4.554054054054054

2648210,5,B000HWZ4E8,"If you watched the SUPERMAN series when it was aired in the 50's,well...

The DVD's are now much better! WHY? Because... after the first two seasons, they decided to shoot all remaining new episodes in color (even though, in the 50's, they did not broadcast the episodes in color). They thought ahead, though, by switching to color, because someday, the episodes of the third through six series could eventually be seen in color. The color on the DVDs of the last four seasons is pretty darn good. I gave the series 5-stars because I wanted to view all the episodes which I missed as a kid. For me, it is kind of replaying part of my childhood over again. I even remembered a few of the episodes from my watching the show during the late 50's.

2648216,4,B000HWZ4E8,"The final seasons of the ""Adventures of Superman"" feature the classic TV series at its best and worst. Weighed down by childish scripting, some 1957 episodes (notably ""Mr. Zero"" and ""Whatever Goes Up"") are embarrassing to watch. However, the 1958 season displays a remarkable upswing with stronger storylines and production values  highlighted by ""Divide and Conquer,"" ""The Mysterious Cube"" and ""Superman's Wife."" George Reeves directed three episodes with great flair, including the justly famous ""Perils of Superman."" Once again, the DVD set was transferred from the best existing 35mm prints, with the color-stock defects noticeably absent in the sixth season. Apart from a good mini-documentary on Jack Larson, there are no extras or commentary tracks.",1168387200,4,756,5.573913043478261
2648217,4,B000HWZ4E8,"Having been a kid when it first came on tv and after watching each episode putting on a towel around my neck and jumping off our front porch, it's been a lot of fun to see them again.  The first season was the best, Phyllis Coates much more believable and strong, stories tougher and tauter.  Contrary to Ben Afflect, George Reeves was not only talented, but so likeable, tough and smart in what could have become an even sappier role.  One very well written episode about a boy who accidentally photographed Superman changing from Clark Kent, has inside joke lines and character referring back to Reeves as a Tarleton twin in Gone with The Wind.  I also have on vinyl Superman radio episodes from old Pep Kellog's corn Flakes.",1168387200,4,727,4.612403100775194

It was worth it for me to have the entire collectiion intact and ready to view when in the mood. A really fun show with consummate professional actors, writers, directors and producers! The only downside are wishes - that a little more post history was given after the show was cancelled  and almost brought back. Also wish that the original broadcast beginnings with the Kelloggs cerial commercials were inserted for at least one show in the special Features section.
