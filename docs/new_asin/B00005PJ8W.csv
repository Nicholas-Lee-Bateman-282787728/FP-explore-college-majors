I remember growing up to this series and had to wait for repeats on TV so i could tape it and watch it over and over again. Not only is it available for the first time in it's entirity but it's available on DVD, you can't get any better than that. Buy this collection today or regret it forever.",1000080000,2,370,4.152777777777778
1642632,5,B00005PJ8W,"First let me say I believe this is the first time ever 20th century fox has released the t.v. series on home video, and better yet--it's on DVD! This television series I feel is very underrated. I watched this show when I was a kid and I felt all the episodes were very worthy short stories. The series is about two astronauts that wind up on the PLANET OF THE APES! The series timeline is supposed to be a few thousand years before the first movie! The astronauts are played by RON HARPER & JAMES NAUGHTON! Of course, RODDY MCDOWALL plays Galen and MARK LEONARD(Sarek of ""STAR TREK"")plays Urko, leader of the gorrila apes. Every episode is done very well and should be in your collection if you're a fan of THE PLANET OF THE APES at all. One of the episodes even has a young MARC SINGER(V, THE BEASTMASTER)! All in all, a very fine series, despite what the critics thought at the time! Buy it today!",999648000,13,900,4.363095238095238

1642677,1,B00005PJ8W,"This was my first Amazon-made video and it makes me very doubtful about buying their print on demand stuff ever again. Terrible quality and there was a 10 min long corrupted spot in the very first episode that forced me to skip past that part of the episode. Since I didn't find any other spots, and I'll only be watching it as background now and then I didn't return it, but I'm quite disappointed. The sound quality was so bad I had to switch from my stereo speakers back to the TV ones, and still couldn't make out what they were saying half the time without subtitles. The visual was not a good restoration, dull and bleh. This is not a series with a lot of color to it due to the subject matter and setting, but it could at least be sharp and have some contrast, but it doesn't. I give it one star simply because if you're an old school 70's sci-fi fan there's really not much like it. The show was low budget, and it shows everywhere, but there was some fun post-apocalyptic interior decorating that blends someone's idea of ape culture with the art design trends of the 70's, (which is what I like about it most).  If you like trivia the series brings up some obvious Planet of the Apes lore breaking like why is there a dog literally in the first scene in the first episode when dogs/cats being wiped out by a disease is the original reason that Apes were brought from the jungle, forced to work for humans and eventually took over? Still like the series, but can't recommend this version unless you're desperate. If you can get a -good- copy it's worth owning.",1468195200,,1569,4.373287671232877

As old as this TV show is, it still hold today. A must own for any Planet Of The Apes movie fan or anyone who wants to watch good clean fun. I am addicted. And yes like most of the great TV shows it was canceled all too soon. One season was not enough but it is so good I can watch it over and over.

On another note I met Ron Harper who plays Vern at an autograph show and he was the sweetest nicest guy, much like his character in Planet Of The Apes. He gave me a little kiss and my childhood crush on him was somewhat fulfilled. .",1447459200,3,808,3.9207317073170733

Special effects and props have little to do with this show although some episodes do harken back to the past (which is closer to the present day than it was in 1975.) The Ape society is rural, agrarian and low tech. The ape make-up is good. This series is not really exiting but it is fun to watch.

As to the series itself, it was done at a time before CGI and with very limited budget, but with actors such as Mark Lenard (Sarek of Star Trek) and Roddy McDowall, it is worth watching. The writing could have been better, but it is somewhat typical of 70s TV shows in that respect.

1642756,5,B00005PJ8W,"My all time favorite sci-fi movie is the original ""Planet Of The Apes"". I have lost count how many times I have watched it but one thing I do remember was when the TV series ""Planet Of The Apes"" came on in 1974. Based on the movie but still different at the same time I was hooked on the show right from the start. So when I heard the series was cancelled halfway through the '74 season I was very disappointed.

So imagine my surprise and delight when I got for this past Christmas the two DVD box set of the ""Planet Of The Apes"" TV series. Friends let me tell you, it is almost impossible for a TV series that lasts only one season to be released on DVD though it has happened. ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" which lasted only one season from 1974 to '75 might be the best example of that. But for a series to last only half a season to make it onto a DVD box set is just about unheard of. Yet they did it for ""Planet Of The Apes: The Complete TV Series"".

While based on the 1968 film the series still had its own story line that was in some ways like the movie and in other ways different. Like the movie it all starts with three astronauts crash landing on an unknown planet. Two of the three astronauts survive the crash, played by Ron Harper and James Naughton. Much to their surprise they find out the planet is ruled by apes and humans are their servants. The big way that the series differs from the movie is the humans can talk and do converse with the apes. But humans are nothing more then slaves to the apes. But like the movie the astronauts soon realize they are indeed back on Earth, just a few centuries into the future with no hope of going back.

The third star of the series is Roddy McDowall who like in the movie plays an apes. But he does not play the character Cornelias as he was in the movie but an ape named Galen who does not agree the astronauts should be killed and eventually in the first episode helps the two escape and all three become fugitives. There are two characters from the original film who do appear in the series. Dr. Zaius, the leader and head scientist of the apes, and General Urko, the leader of the army. Interesting note here is that Mark Lenard plays Urko. Star trek fans will remember that Lenard played Sarek, Mr. Spock's father in the original series and in the Star Trek movies.

The story lines are well written. The acting very good and the special effects especially makeup is good. Many of the sets in the show are from the original movie so it gives a feeling of familiarity to the story. The picture quality is also very good. I doubt there was any re-mastering done to the show before putting it on DVD but it doesn't matter. It all looks very sharp and clear.

The nice thing for me is while I remember watching the show and the characters it has been decades since I have seen the episodes. As a result it is like I am watching the shows for the first time and wondering what will happen next. There is only 14 episodes since it only lasted a half season but it includes not only the 13 episodes that were aired but one episode that never made it on the air because the series was cancelled before it could be played on TV. No special features in this set. But considering I never expected ""Planet Of The Apes: The Complete TV Series"" to even ever make it onto DVD I have no complaints with that. If you remember and loved this series as much as I do you owe it to yourself to get this collection!",1420070400,2,3460,4.212669683257919

1642810,3,B00005PJ8W,"The TV show 'Planet of the Apes' was based on the hugely popular ""Apes"" movies at that time period. The story was similar to the original film except that, in this version, the humans talked and had their own villages. They were basically an inferior race, but not hunted and shot like animals. Astronauts Alan Virdon and Pete Burke (Played by actors Ron Harper and James Naughton) left earth in 1981 and found themselves projected in time to the year 3085 where the story begins as they are found by a human (played by Royal Dano) who helps them escape from the apes in the pilot episode. However, it was arguably ape Galen (played by Roddy McDowall) and Urko (Played by Mark Lenard) who really made the show shine as much as possible.
This series should have been a hit but just missed the mark. There are many speculations as to why only 14 episodes were produced (From Sept 13, 1974- Dec 6, 1974) and only aired 13 of them. Perhaps it is just the fact that you can only do so much with this kind of premise. Most of the stories were about how village humans (and some apes) help renegade Galen, Alan and Pete escape from Urko. A few episodes were better than others, such as the actual pilot episode, the episode ""Trapped"" where Urko and Pete are trapped underneath ape city and need to help each other get out, and ""The Interrogation"" where Pete is being brainwashed by an ape doctor played by Beverly Garland. Unfortunately, there was little real suspense in the stories and it just never really found an audience. Possibly it was too silly for many adults but also too boring for young kids. Of course, there was the competition of rival networks (Sanford and Son) that also lured them away from the show.
Since their original air date, the TV series usually is repeated as Apes Tele-movies by having two episodes back-to-back that are similar in story concept. It's unlikely to find a station to air the episodes as originally seen in 1974 unless you purchase this set.
I am a 'Planet of the Apes' fan. I have this series to help complete my collection. That is probably the biggest reason why people have bought this series. Remember, it is not much like the original film except for the ape makeup and they live in simple surroundings rather than like the original novel.

It sure is nice to have these rare episodes available on DVD, as I have not seen them in years. While not being as good as the theatrical Apes films from the late 60s and early 70s, This 1974 series was a pretty worthy follow up to those movies.

The only ""extras"" are a composite trailer for the original film Pentalogy and a Trailer for the 2001 Tim Burton re-imagining.

About the series itself:
Perhaps the thing which sets the classic POTA movies so far apart from most mainstream science fiction franchises, and indeed most mainstream fiction in general, is their misanthropic pessimism. What is ape society but a lens through which we can see the deep hypocrisies, brutality and continual failures of humankind? Of course, none of these cynical, philosophical elements made it onto this (for the time) lavishly expensive series designed to take on ""Chico and the Man"" and other popular, family friendly fare. So we're left with a re-imagining which has a mostly positive, optimistic worldview.

Don't be quick to dismiss this series because of that philosophical shift however, there's still a lot to enjoy here. First and foremost, Roddy McDowell. Although he doesn't seem that ""into it"" early in the series and is barely seen in some of the middle episodes, toward the end he really starts to shine and it's easy to remember why he became the true star of the franchise. The make-up designs are still beautiful even though the quality is about on par with ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"", which is to say cheap compared to the previous movies. And we get to see some interesting variations on the classic costumes. The series manages to address a few serious issues and have some nice drama while still being fun and keeping a positive outlook. Sure, you can do some mental gymnastics and convenient memory loss to try and squeeze these episodes into the chronology of the original films. They look so similar it's easy to understand the desire to do so. But I believe they're best accepted for what they are, above average 1970s TV.

I took the star off because this set does not include some of the really juicy extras it could have, and the episodes are not restored. But all in all any Apes fan should be happy with it. Definitely worth a spin.",1376438400,,2317,4.802005012531328

I like this better than any of the films that were made of this because it wasn't glossy and it really delved into the human condition, using the apes' characters to reveal many of our flaws and how to correct them. I especially love this series because of all the science in it. I have often laughed while watching some of it, thinking NO ASTRONAUT today knows all the things Virdon and Burke do AND knows martial arts! lol And these guys taught MacGyver everything he knew. lol The description is incorrect in noting Charleton Heston as one of the actors - no, he was in the original Hollywood film that introduced us to this whole storyline, but he is not in the tv episodes. This is the kind of stuff they should be showing on television, in place of the garbage they do show, which I don't watch anymore thanks to not renewing any cable, etc. :) I wish there were more really creative shows like this one out there. Roddy McDowall is one of the most underrated actors as well - and every one of those that played an ape should be commended - they really do a remarkable job of acting wearing all those appliances on their faces and the heavy suits, etc. They had to be burning up on location with that stuff on.

1642886,4,B00005PJ8W,"No, it's far from the Planet of the Apes we all loved with Charlton Heston, but it's apes nonetheless. I only gave it four stars, because it never really met my expectations. But, I had some really high expectations for this show. I enjoyed this series when it first aired being a huge fan of science fiction and anything to do with Planet of the Apes. Yes, I even enjoyed that weird one shot redo that was done a few years ago with Mark Wahlberg. I actually was hoping for a sequel. That never happened. But, Rise of the Planet of the Apes made up for it. This is a lower budget kind of retelling/after the first 2 movies of the planet of the apes. It does not take anything from the last three movies into account in my opinion. I am certain that others will differ with me. There is a very ""Leave you hanging"" unresolved ending as if they might be planing another season that never happened. The story is about an ape (Roddy McDowell) and two humans from present time who find themselves in the future on a planet ruled by apes. The ape Galen befriends the humans and try's to help them find a way back to their time. They travel from location to location searching for that way. Along they way, as you might expect, they encounter all sorts of situations involving apes who dislike or hate humans. That's the premiss, anything else would be spoilers which I won't give. Is it worth the price, I think so. I paid substantially more, but I got it when it first came out. So, if you are a fan, or not, get the tv series of Planet of the Apes and enjoy.

Its results...a TV series that dealt with the times...bigotry, race relations and the such but failed to generate enough ratings against the super series of the time. The series stared Roddy McDowell as Galen, Ron Harper as astronaut Alan Virdon and James Naugton as astronaut Peter Burke. Astronauts Virdon and Burke (along with Jones) crash lands and discovers they are on a future Earth ruled by apes. Not quite the planet of the apes in the movies, that one took place in the New York area (Conquest was somewhat murky as to its location). This series takes place on the West coast in California and at a time when humans can still speak but are less inteligent and are treated as slaves.

1642933,2,B00005PJ8W,"""Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes"" - ""A great plague killed off all the cats and dogs that man so loved to enjoy and cherish for companionship. Man would not give up his pets however; when dogs and cats all died a new pet was merely substituted. Society began to see primates such as Chimpanzees appear on the scene as a new source of companionship.""

So why in the opening scene of episode 1 of the TV series do we have a chimp out walking his dog?

Apologists state this movie's time is set between ""Battle For The Planet of The Apes"" and ""Planet of The Apes"".

We have a fully developed ape culture, but no traces of humans going mute, and they've only got 893 more years to get tongue tied.

The original film has Taylor's crew leaving Earth in the year 1972 and return to an ape ruled planet in 3978. In the TV series, Virdon and Burke leave Earth in 1980 and arrive on the ape planet in 3085. If Virdon and Burke left Earth within the same time-line of the films, why don't they recall Zira and Cornelius arriving in 1973?

Virdon and Burke are shown a book that has in it a futuristic picture of New York City, circa. 2503. But according to the movie timeline, mankind fell to the apes in the latter part of the 20th century, making such a photo impossible.

Virdon, Burke and Galen visit the remains of San Francisco-Oakland in two episodes. Although the astronauts have previously found evidence of lingering radiation, the damage they see in the city is consistent with general decay and earthquake activity over a long period of time, not a nuclear strike. In ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" on the other hand, San Francisco looks to have suffered meltdown from a nuclear airburst.

One starts to wonder if the writers actually bothered watching the movies that spawned the series.

I'm hoping that it wasn't the intent of a bad writer to imply that the Dr. Zaius who runs things is supposed to be the same Dr. Zaius from the first movie, as there's that little issue of ~900 years passing.

Minor beefs - General Urko wants to get rid of the humans.  Dr. Zaius (in possession of some human made hand grenades - still potent after all these years) says 'No, we have to learn how they harnessed this destructive power, so they won't be a threat to us.'  Wouldn't just killing all the humans like Urko wants also eliminate the threat?  Given this presupposition that they want to learn the secret of human technology, you'd think they'd want to study Virdon & Burke's spaceship, wouldn't you?  So naturally, instead, they blow it up with one of the aforementioned grenades.",1352851200,2,2588,4.504273504273504

The astronauts from the future suggest that they had 'west' or 'south' with no real clear purpose, save for their 'escape of the week' from the resident baddies, General Urko, and/or Dr. Zaius. Thankfully they have the wonderful Roddy McDowall as Galen accompanying them along the way and lifting the tone of the show.
Whilst those complaints are valid, the show stands tall as an example of a fair translation to the small screen from the large. I can remember huddling around the set hanging to watch each episode. We have to remember this pre-dated  videos - the movies were only a big screen or repeated on TV experience - so these were a real thrill!
So for the purposes of nostalgia, this TV series is a rush. Admittedly, the DVD menus are a bit clunky and hesitant, but this trip into the distant future is an enjoyable trip back in time for a lot of us!",1197072000,8,1318,4.533613445378151
1642996,4,B00005PJ8W,"A not so bad but extremely short-lived show.  McDowell back as a friendly chimp starring with Ron Harper (previously know for GARRISON'S GUERILLAS) and James Naughton -- brother of AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON's David Naughton.  One episode features a very young Marc Singer and William Smith as his dad.  Sorry, but in real life Naughton's astronaut character could not have beaten Big Bill.",1196640000,,391,5.174603174603175
1642997,2,B00005PJ8W,"There are a few decent episodes that deal with being trapped in the future and searching through the ruins of the past. In particular, The Legacy stands out for its glimpse into what might have happened to civilization and its sense of loss. I also liked the one where they're trapped in the old subway tunnel for the same reason. But even that one is slow.

However, most of the episodes are simply based on them traveling from one community to the next, always on the run and always finding new adventures. While we're in this town we'll cure a disease, while we're in this town we'll have a horse race. It's not unlike The Incredible Hulk TV series. The astronauts prove to be jacks of all trades with many convenient skills and in the end we all learn a lesson.

As I've watched this, I couldn't help but think what a J.J. Abrahms might do to add some depth to the plots. There needs to be more going on in each episode, plot wise, and there is certainly room for much more character development. It's not hard to notice that when one character is focused on for an episode, the other doesn't do much more than jog beside him, ask a couple questions and come in for a timely flying kick. This series is ripe for the kind of update given Battlestar Galactica and now, the Bionic Woman.

Finally, the humans need updating. They are an awfully well mannered, and white, bunch compared to the dark and brutish apes. Many have commented on the subtext of race that runs through the movies and this show, and maybe it is because the humans now speak (surprisingly recognizable english for a thousand years hence) but the show comes across as being racist itself because the simple hard working decent white people are being brutalized by the savage dark apes. It's not that far off of a typical racist vision of what happens when the ""savages"" are allowed to hold power. Note too, that the darker the apes are, the more brutish, ignorant and mean they act. By contrast, the light skinned chimps are kind to the humans and even, in the case of fellow traveler Roddy McDowell, come equipped with civilized English accents.

Like everyone else, I loved this show when I was a kid, but it deserved to be cancelled because for a show about astronauts trapped in a future world ruled by talking apes, it was mostly pretty boring.",1193616000,5,2321,4.519047619047619

1643022,4,B00005PJ8W,"After the success of the 'Planet of the Apes' film franchise, and after several films had brought the storyline almost full circle, it seems with hindsight only natural for the producers and studio to decide to extend the success of this series onto television.  The experiment was short-lived, as the 'Planet of the Apes' television series only lasted for half a season (American standard).  The shows were very popular in Britain and other nations, but without an American audience (and American advertising dollars coming into the studio), the series was destined to be one of those interesting, irritatingly half-complete storylines.

The special effects in the series were fairly well done, considering items such as the make-up technology (which won awards in the cinematic productions) and sets such as the central ape city were hold-overs from the films.  Another carry-forward was Roddy McDowall, who played the leading ape character in most of the films - in the television series, he reprises a similar role, but one with a different history and motivation.  The characters of Dr. Zaius, chief scientist and 'defender of the faith', and General Urko, a militant gorilla ('the only good human is a dead human') are also characters held over from the films.

The plot is same as the beginning of the film series - American astronauts somehow land on the earth of the distant future, a thousand years or so, in a post-apocalyptic world where human civilisation has been virtually destroyed, and a dominant race of apes has supplanted them as the authority in the world.  Unlike the early films, the humans in this alternate world can talk, read, and live in parallel communities with the apes, although always to varying degrees under ape control and subjugation.  There are tantalizing bits of archaeological information that lead the senior apes (Dr. Zaius and a few of his confidants) to the understanding that humans once ruled the world to a much greater degree than the apes, with better technology; however, one understanding central to the ape belief structure is that humankind must be kept subordinate, as the humans are the only species to kill its own kind, and practically destroyed the world in which they (and the predecessors of the apes) lived.  Astronauts thus represent a grave threat to the new ape world order - they represent a technological superiority that might infect the humans with ideas of equality.

Thus, Planet of the Apes becomes a morality tale in many ways - rigid beliefs going against common sense, ideas of racial inequality built on prejudice (there is even a minor plot device of prejudice of certain kinds of apes against others - gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees often mistrust each other, uniting at times it seems only in their common disdain for humans).

The first episode of the series introduces two new astronaut characters (the most famous of whom, from the first film, was played by Charleton Heston).  These two astronauts (a third died in transit, again an idea taken from the films) are Virdon and Burke, played by Ron Harper and James Naughton.  After crashing, they are found by sympathetic humans who help hide them; when captured, they escape with the help of an ape named Galen (McDowall), whose common sense forces him to recognise the truth in what the astronauts are saying.  Galen, Virdon and Burke then begin a life on the run, both working to stay alive and out of the clutches of Urko (Mark Lenard, perhaps best known for playing roles on Star Trek, including Spock's father, Sarek), and working to find a computer or other technological aid that might get them back home.

There are fourteen episodes in all; these include episodes in which the astronauts introduce techniques of better farming to poor rural folk, new ideas of disease control when a village is struck by malaria, and even build a hang glider to escape from a chimpanzee who wants to use an archaeological find (fragmentary bombs) with the glider for an aerial bombardment against central city.  The episodes are fairly formulaic - a problem is presented that hinges upon poor understanding of human potential or previously-known scientific/technological knowledge; either a human or an ape distrusts the trio; the three eventually win over the skeptics with their abilities and basic decency, and then they must run again to avoid discovery.

It is unclear where the series was going to go, had it continued.  It was cancelled in mid-season, and the final aired episode literally leaves the astronauts and Galen adrift in the sea, having escaped the authorities once again after having proven their technological superiority.  Even with the formula nature of the series, the shows were worthwhile in many respects.  I recall seeing this on television first when I was ten years old - to a young person, the plots illustrate their points in the way that fables work (most of the episodes are stories with a moral).  When I watched the episodes again via DVD (all fourteen produced are available, including one which was never aired during the original broadcast run), they stood the test of time fairly well.  Unlike the original Star Trek series, which, thanks to sets and costumes can often seem very dated, this series has a bit more timelessness to it (although the acting and production values are very much product of the 1970s).

For those who like science fiction in general, and the Planet of the Apes franchise in particular, this is a good series.  It might even have some appeal for those who like a bit of fantasy or post-apocalyptic adventure of a very G-rated variety.  The DVD has a few extra features - some episode commentaries, and a few theatrical trailers (for the original series of films, and for the more recent remake starring 'Marky' Mark Wahlberg).  As a blast from the past (as I remember certain portions of the series, including the final drifting away, quite vividly), watching these was a great treat.",1171324800,33,5980,4.972918756268807

This 4 disc boxed set of ""The Planet of The Apes"" TV series is a welcomed addition for fans of the show or the movies. The good thing is you really don't have to know anything about the movies to enjoy this show. I recently picked up this set and had a planet of the apes TV marathon of my own. This set containing all 14 episodes of the short lived TV series has brought back some great childhood memories for me.

The one thing I never forgot about this show was the opening theme music, it definitely added to the mood of the show. This show features some great episodes and memorable characters and it ended much too soon. The studio has done a pretty good job with the quality of this set. The picture and sound are nice, but nowhere near the quality of the evolution or legacy sets. The video transfer is pretty clear and the mono sound is good but it should have been in Dolby Digital 5.1. The studio probably could have remastered the picture and sound but didn't for some reason.

Let's face it, television just isn't what it used to be anymore and shows like this don't exist. Reality TV has taken over and there isn't anything for the whole family to gather around the TV to watch. Who knows, if you buy this set your kids may go ape over it.

This TV Series is a cult classic simply because it is extremely good, entertaining and charismatic. Why?

Well, first of all, the comradeship and friendship that slowly develops between Galen, Burke and Virdon is television at its best. It's emotional and funny. Second, each episode is good on its own, with very good dialogue and balanced drama and fighting scenes. Third: Urko. This guy is simply one of the best villains of all times (even if he's not properly a villain, but just someone who wants to mantain things as they are, due to ignorance and knowing the damage human beings can do).

The ape's make-up is very credible, it does not make you wanna laugh and gives chance to interpretation by the supporting cast of apes. There is an extraordinary number of out-door sequences, a thing I like a lot.

It's a show that should have lasted more. We will never know how it would have ended, there were so many possibilities (I particularly think Burke and Virdon were doomed since the start, they never had a real chance of going back to Earth).

When I had finished watching all 14 episodes, I was truly sorry to have no more to look forward to.  It's a shame the series didn't get the chance to play longer and give us a conclusion.

1643069,5,B00005PJ8W,"I bought this about 3 years ago and watched and loved it then. It was relatively new then (on dvd) and was very new to me. There weren't many reviews back then but now that this product has been around some reviews here really have taken me aback and forced this rewrite. After getting through the Fifth Episode, ""The Legacy"" on this my second run through, I was just accosted by a sense of loss. This series was so damn good it's almost difficult to watch (knowing it's fate). The reviews here that have shaken me are the ones that say A. It's boring, B. The plots are all the same. While we are entitled to an opinion neither A nor B is acceptable to me.

Surely, a major tension are Galen, Burke, and Virdon running from Urko but if you can watch episodes like The Good Seeds or The Legacy and only take away A.) Men and chimp run from big gorillas; frankly I'm amazed you were smart enough to buy this set to begin with. The way The Legacy weaves our past from the future is surely a stroke a brillance, not to mention getting the jump on big names like Star Wars and Superman with the use of the hologram. All I'm asking for is the respect it deserves. And talk about getting ""a jump""... this duo bare a remarkable resemblance to Starsky and Hutch (another show I love) that will not be born for ANOTHER year, 1975!

And now, my old review: January 20, 2002

New Found Friends:

Let me first put my credentials on the table. I am a fan of the universe created by the Planet Of The Apes the original movie. On the strength of that one movie I have fallen in love with the aura that is Planet Of The Apes. I loved the look of the housing, the set-up of the society, and the wonderous soundtrack. However, that's almost where it ended because I never cared for ANY of the sequels or the revision (though ""Escape"" had its merits). It pained me to be so in love with a piece of work without being able to embrace more of the body. Enter curiousity. When I first saw a few reviews of the TV series pop-up here at Amazon I waited to see more and more... as more and more 4 and 5 stars arose I became sure it would be a worthy buy (though naturally concerned I would be disappointed).

Planet Of The Apes The TV Series: I went into this boxset with the understanding that the visuals would not be up to par with the first movie, that never bothered me because I am a fan of the original Star Trek series, needless to say, 'nuff said. However, these visuals actually range from being good to quite great in a 70's TV sort of way. The crumbled city in The Legacy looks remarkable, even the masks look good when not in extreme close-ups. Understand, I had never watched the series while it was on TV (I was in 1st grade), so I am judging this purely on this new experience, and I am amazed.

Cast: Virdon, Burke, and Galen are instantly likable. I felt after watching the first episode that the chemistry was perfect. From Virdons every mans hero stance and knowledge to Burkes absolutely dead-pan sarcasm to Galens insatiable curiousity, each character has a pupose. Mark Lenard is also good in this though not actually in each episode as much as I had assumed he would be. That is alright though, because the main cast is MORE than adequate.

Transfer & Sound: The transfer to dvd while it is generally ""good"" certainly is far from perfect. A lot of the time as a scene starts there is ""noise"" (not sure how to explain it) flickering on the screen and the sound is a dissappointing mono(Star Trek in '67 was remastered in 5.1 DS). However, I cannot be happier with the score. It is INCREDIBLE! So absolutely fitting with the original movie, the score is instantly recognizable and helps to create the ""mood"" of the series every bit as much as the Star Trek score did for that series.

The dvd case: I had read on here that a few people had problems with the rather bloated case that houses the four discs. I am not one of them. The artwork is great and the case fits perfectly next to my POTA and POTA Behind The Scenes.

Conclusion: I am only halfway through this wonderous boxset and yet I was compelled to write my review. I didn't want to RUSH through the 14 episodes to write my review and yet I just couldn't wait. Somehow, I feel as though I have been watching this series for a lifetime, it just seems so grounded. As though the cast had been making this series for 10 years and these episodes were merely pulled from the middle of the series. Virdon, Burke, and Galen were not only worth my time, they were worth every penny (and then some).",1118016000,5,4546,4.307602339181287
1643070,4,B00005PJ8W,"Many people were ""aped out"" after 5 Ape films by the time this show appeared. Others compared this show to the films and didn't find the same big screen bombast in the television series. Those who loved this (and still do) were those who were not ""aped out"" and didn't expect the series to be exactly like the big screen versions. They accepted this as something smaller but friendlier. I think that's why so many people have ultimately come to love this show over time and I'm sure that's also why these episodes scored such good ratings when edited into movies for TV in the 80's. People had recovered from the whole Apes craze by then and were ready to enjoy these ""TV movie"" versions as something fun that aired every now and then. That's why this series is just right for DVD viewing too. It's no longer just the latest chapter in a huge recent film franchise that some have grown weary of. It's good fun that you can kick back with and enjoy when in the right mood. It may not be perfect (what is?) but you can't help wanting to spend good times with it every now and then.

1643073,4,B00005PJ8W,"Those of us who grew up on television in the seventies won't fail to remember the march of short-lived TV series that dominated our television screens, most particularly Kolchak, Logan's Run and of course, The Planet of the Apes.  For the proverbial record, the only movies that matter for this review are the first two.  Escape, Conquest, and Battle all take place immediately after the Apes have overthrown the human civilization.  As this series takes place two thousand years later, these movies are academic.  For continuity purposes, you're probably better off (as the producers probably did) pretending that the Beneath film just didn't happen.  This means that apes didn't overthrow civilization so much as inherit it, after the humans holocausted themselves off the stage.  Fine.  On with the series.  Hurray!  Roddy McDowall is one of the stars, great actor, great asset.  But how do you overcome plot holes and plausibility issues?  For starters, why do our heroes spend the entire series traveling on foot?  Sure, humans caught riding horses are put to death, but if you're already wanted by The State for death, what the hell difference does it make?  Also, since when do astronauts learn how to make quinine from tree barks???  And when did astronauts start to get trained in kung-fu and the basics of brawling?  For me ""The Legacy"" was both the best of times (great story!) and the worst of times in that it kind of made the whole series moot, because it reduced all the major characters to futile archtypes, especially Zeus and Urko.  This was a series that could've been great, but was chasing its own tail instead.  What would've been most effective was one of those story arcs that made series like Buffy/Angel and the X-Files so great; regrettably, the TV viewing public just wasn't ready for that yet.  The producers for this series had no plan, other than make Burke, Verdon and Galan go left to the sea, then right to the mountains, then back left to the sea, then right again; this tactic of 'winging it' is reflected in the episodes, especially ""The Good Seeds"", ""The Gladiators"", ""Tomorrow's Tide"" and ""The Horse Race""-where they are either trying to save their own collective asses, or are tripping with the locals on basic technology, such as.....the lever.  Whoa.  This isn't to say the series wasn't worth watching, it was.  All of the regulars:  Ron Harper, Mike Naughton, Roddy, Booth Colman, and Mark Lenard put in fine performances.  I remember feeling particulary menaced by Urko's (with Lenard's erudite style of delivery) pragmatic bloodthirstiness.  The last episode, ""Up Above The World So High"" will by then seem anticlimactic and formulaic (Verdon and Burke have to do some feat of technology and remain secret about it), but if you stuck the series out this far, then you'll be able to forgive.  Extras on the DVD set are beyond chincy.  You get two trailers and that's it.  The transfer is of above average quality, but with hard to find TV series, I'm easy to please.  There is some lint and scratches on the transfer, but my viewing pleasure wasn't torpedoed by this, unlike some purists who may find this an irritation.",1099872000,7,3165,4.876404494382022

Thanks to the actors and characters this was a vibrant and watchable program which never became just another retread of a movie or just another Fugitive clone. The actors both major and minor always shined and the writers knew how to write them even when stuck with the restrictions of 70's formula TV and that all helped to make this show something special. Having every episode on DVD is fantastic.,1097452800,4,534,4.515463917525773

Sadly, this was the only season made.  Alot of people may feel like the last episode is a let down, and you want to know what would happen.  But in my opinon, it is a great ending.  its beautiful to see and think about...""hmm, what could happen?""

1643077,5,B00005PJ8W,"IT'S ABOUT A BUNCH OF APES AND HUMANS WHO CAN'T GET ALONG!!! WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN THAT? Yet, the Planet of the Apes Television is highly under rated as an asset to the POTA cult genre. In the series, Ron Harper and James Naughton play astronauts, Alan Virdon and Peter J. Burke from their Earth of the past, crashing on the Ape planet, not realizing at first that they have come home in much the same fashion POTA fans are accustomed to in the movies. There is an excellent attention to the teaser and intro for these episodes indicating that the writing and production were of superior quality for television studios in 1981. In fact, the attention to the music, costume, and set (mostly shot on location outside the studio) denote the meticulous quality of direction and editing that took place. A lot of work was done to reconcile the movies that predated the series, and a lot of changes were made in a good way. Differing from the movies, humans in the series talked and wore clothes (more similar to the humans in the Tim Burton version of the Planet of the Apes Movie, starring Mark Wahlberg). This was necessary to reduce the tension from apocalyptic themes to humankind struggles-you simply cannot have an explanation of the problems of humanity if the people cannot talk. It just doesn't work that way. The best news however, is that Roddy Mcdowell who played Cornelius in the movies is back as ""Galen"" in the series. Booth Coleman does a remarkable job of course as Zaius and the most excellent tid-bit of trivia for the cast is revealed with Mark Lenard who plays General Urko. Lenard is a recruit from the hit cult TV series, Star Trek, and is best known for his outstanding performance as Sarek of Vulcan.
Lenard's performance is in fact so good as General Urko, that when I think of Ape military, Urko is the character that stands out in my mind. General Urko is played sufficiently brutish, rash, and impatient, just as you would expect from watching the movies. However, every actor's performance was a testament to the quality of these episodes bringing shame to the many hi-tech, hi-cost jet set science fiction series that flop in the 21st century. I prefer to think of the TV series as a huge mini-series based on this point alone.  Clearly, good writing played a large part in these episodes with complex themes coupled with exciting film work. Each episode is like a movie all its own, and with 14 episodes, you will never tire of them. It is sad that this series was cut short but it also creates a strong point for viewers. This series is obtainable, watchable, and learnable in a very short period of time. You can study the characters, experience their social messages and enjoy them without the cheesy special effects present in comparable sci-fi on TV or in movies for the series' time period. Not only do I recommend the Planet of the Apes TV series, but I would be so bold as to say that it is the best medicine for the entertainment blues of more than just sci-fi or POTA fanatics. I've personally introduced the series to women, youngsters, teens, and older people who always have something good to say or reflect upon.
In short, I'd also like to add that this wholesome family entertainment from a dying breed of TV show that respected family values and ideals. The show's handling of virtue and integrity are refreshing from the smut that generally ruins what was originally a great idea on television. Enrich yourself and others, buy this series before this world goes to the simians.",1084406400,3,3525,4.658105939004815
1643106,5,B00005PJ8W,"Anyone who loved the original POTA movie series from the late 1960s and early 1970s will love the TV series. Unfortunately I had only seen one or two episodes when this first came out in 1974 because I was starting my first year of college back then. I did watch a couple of the syndicated movies (two episodes blocked together into a TV movie) in the 1980s but never really got into it. Having rediscovered the ape movies recently, I was eager to look at the entire TV series, but hesitant to spend the money to buy the set.
It turns out that my money was well spent. In fact, this is the single best DVD purchase I've ever made. To say that I was stunned when I saw the episodes in all of their wonderful crispness and glory would be an understatement. The film transfer is mint. Sure, there's a few specs, but so what? It's as near to perfect as anyone could expect. Watching these episodes is sheer joy, and I would say without hesitation that these episodes are even better than the movie sequels.
All of the above seems to contradict what some reviewers have said about this series using phrases like ""low budget"" and not having the kind of location shooting that the films had. Nothing could be further from the truth! Every episode is filmed, more or less, exactly like the movies were. You see mountains, ocean, crisp blue skies, forests, elaborate set pieces...if this isn't shooting on location, then what is? The TV series also takes advantage of the creative costumes, makeup work, and even stock footage that was created for the original film. But there is enough new sets and location filming here for the series to make its own mark. No other science fiction TV series had the kind of budget that the POTA TV series did. For example, both Lost in Space and Star Trek both primarily filmed on stage with a bunch of cardboard props. Not POTA. I felt like I bought 14 mini-movies, most of which I've never seen. Don't make the mistake of assuming this is some kind failed crackerbox low grade exploitation of the film series. This series of films really do justice to the film series and to Pierre Boulle. They successfully transfered the zany and elaborate world of the apes onto the small screen.
Roddy McDowell, who played Cornelius and Caesar in the movie series, plays Galen in the TV series. This fine actor is what brings the whole series together. He is imminently watchable in this series. Ron Harper and James Naughton both do fine work as the two astronauts who crash landed on the simian-ruled planet. By the middle part of the series, you can see the simian Galen and the humans bonding. And the series really takes off with ""The Legacy"" (where a matte is expertly used to create the impression of a bombed out city) and all episodes following.
It simply isn't fair to compare the POTA TV series to any other science fiction series because of the high production values. You see more apes in this series than you do in ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" which resorted to using cheap masks for all the extras. No such short-cuts were made here. They may have streamlined the makeup process for the series, but it looks just as good as it did in the 1968 original.
I still have a few episodes to watch before I write a more elaborate review, but I'm just too excited to wait. I've been a big fan of POTA for a long, long time. I've read ""Monkey Planet"" by Pierre Boulle several times. I was able to see all 5 ape films on the big screen in a single night (in addition to seeing them all on the big screen when first released). I was disappointed by Timothy Burton's ""revisioning"" (though the film is still worth watching). Watching the POTA TV series on crisp DVD with no commercials is a real treat...it's to a POTA fan what a Star Wars TV series would be to a Star Wars fan if done right. The POTA TV series was done very true to the spirit of the original films and to the book as well. I was also impressed that each episode had a moral or message, and was socially relevant.
BRAVO! This DVD set is a must have, and the price is just right. It's bittersweet that there were only 14 episodes filmed. After watching them, you'll understand why. They were really making mini POTA movies, not episodes. This series was simply too good for television.",1079568000,4,4273,4.47247119078105
1643107,4,B00005PJ8W,"Lacking the budget to have the pyrotechnics, location shooting and opticals of the first two Apes films, the television series focused more on character development. Essentially, Planet of the Apes the t.v. series was The Fugitive set in a truly alien, yet oddly familar world. James Naughton (who returned primarily to the stage after the series was cancelled)and Ron Harper give very strong performances as the astronauts stranded in the future (the ship they used was the same one build for the second film in the series).
When they are found and befriended by Galen (Roddy McDowell), the trio become fugitives. Hunted by General Urko and Dr. Zaius (the marvelous late Mark Lenard of Star Trek fame), they are forced to endure a number of hardships together but develop a strong bond in the process. My favorite episodes involves Urko describing what he thinks ""brainwashing"" is (he literally thinks that you open the skull and wash the brain!)and also another where Naughton becomes stranded with another Ape in an underground cavern which is an old Bart station. Some of the episodes fell into the routine and predictable. Even these episodes have some nicely played character moments from the actors.
Like many television series from the era (this was made in 1974), Apes the series had budget limitations and tended to use standing sets to save money (the recreation of the Court Room from the first film clearly was done on a very tight budget as it isn't quite as convincing). Still, many of the standing sets from the film series (most notably Ape City)make a return cameo in the series giving it larger than life production values for television.
I'd snatch this up as quickly as possible as rumor has it that Fox will eventually be putting the series out of print. It's a pity that there really aren't any extras. Naughton is still around so Fox could have contacted him for commentary. Evidently, the market isn't large enough for the series to warrant the additional cost of commentaries or behind-the-scenes stuff (you know they had to make a couple of promo pieces for the series to sell it to advertisers!).
Like the recently released Lost in Space, Apes comes with all the episodes produced (and, yes, the 14th episode was, indeed, aired)but nothing to provided any context for the series. I'm happy that it's available though and that they didn't go back and artifically create a widescreen edition like they are planning for Kung Fu.",1076198400,2,2453,4.899038461538462

The transfer was simply made from the filmed material onto DVD.
No sound remix, therefore simply monaural transfer. Many of the fourteen episodes muster evident imperfections. The most notable ones, being scratches appearing here and there.
This is simply not enough to re-release a TV series such as this one.
All the episodes, except perhaps two, are just following one main theme: escaping from the Planet of the Apes.
Not enough to hold the attention of a viewer for too long.
The characters we learned to cherish in the movies are long gone and replaced by totally new ones.
Except for Roddy McDowall as Galen and Mark Lenard (who also played Spock's father, Sarek in Star Trek) as General Urko, who steal the show at every turn, the rest of the cast, as well as the guest stars, are just a poor excuse to justify the continuing adventures on the Planet and are just wasted.
All in all, one may suspect a certain unwillingness by the Studio at protracting this torture for far too long.
In fact, the series didn't even make it through a full season.
This series on DVD are just for real fanatics of the genre, but not justifiable to a vaster audience.
In comparison, Tim Burton's new theatrical version, may still be more envisageable than the TV series.
It simply doesn't add anything to the original movies, nor does it reflect Pierre Boulle's vision.

Since this is a period series, albeit in the future, it holds up pretty well.

The release of this set is the only positive result I can see to come out of that terrible remake...  Let us never speak of it again.

The episodes all look very good.  The colors are sharp and vivid to a much greater degree than one might expect from a television series of that age.  The sound is nice.  It might have been nice to have a stereo mix as well, but since this being released on DVD at all is such a blessing, that is really a nitpick.

This box is flimsy and doesn't like to be opened right.  It looks awkward.  And most significantly, it looks lousy anyway you try to set it next to the ""Evolution"" box.  Whose bright idea was that?  That box is functionally bad, aesthetically bad in general terms, and it works poorly for loyal collectors and consumers who want only to be able to properly display this television series alongside the accompanying films.  Considering the fact that this case seems almost unique, it seems unlikely that it was cheaper for them than simply buying or producing a larger quantity of the kinds of cases they've used for similarly sized collections.

The series itself, as many of you should know, varies from episode to episode in quality.  Some are quite good, especially for the time, while others fall easily into familiar formulas and people - and apes - giving simplistic and overly obvious speeches.  The leads are all charismatic, from the ""humans"" James Naughton and Ron Harper to the ""apes"" such as the fellow fugitive Roddy McDowall (from the film series) along with the Booth Coleman as the intelligent but suspicious Dr. Zaius and Mark Lenard (Sarek from the ""Star Trek"" series and films) as the violent and paranoid General Urko.

Ron Harper & James Naughton were cast as astronaut's Alan Virdon and Peter J. Burke who's spaceship gets caught in a time warp, transporting them 2000 years into the future...a world ruled by apes.

Unlike the film series, humans in this time period were able to speak.  The TV series had a very unique way of discussing very important topics such as racism, loyalty, honor, as well as the value of ape/human friendship, and many more.  Unfortunately the series was cancelled after only 13 broadcasts (having something to do with the fact that CBS put the show up against ""Sanford and Son"" & ""Cheecho and The Man"", two of the most popular shows on television at that time..very unwise indeed).

It was only many years later that the show found new life when many episodes were cut and spliced together to form a sort of ""Movie Length"" that began airing along with TV broadcasts of the theatrical films.  Many people began to realize just how good a show Planet of The Apes truly was.

Now, for the very first time (with the exception of Australia), the complete series is available for home viewing..on DVD no less, with the added bonus of an additional episode that never aired originally (""The Liberator"").  I have viewed all 14 episodes in this DVD box set and all I can say is ""BRAVO!  Fox has done it again!""  Now don't expect the picture and sound quality to be tremendous, although the picture is very decent and the sound, though presented in Mono, isn't bad either.

There are four episodes per disc, except for #4 which has two episodes, plus 2 bonus trailers (not indicated on the back of the box) for Planet of The Apes The Evolution Box Set & Planet of The Apes The Tim Burton Film Version.  See for yourself why many consider this show a cult classic.

There were only a few things I never understood about it.  In the first episode (""Escape From Tomorrow"") Virdon (Ron Harper) goes back to the wrecked ship to obtain a small disc that supposedly contains vital information that can only be accessed by a computer, which they begin to search for.  But after episode two, this whole idea was forgotten & abandoned, which never really made sense to me because in episode five (""The Legacy"") a computer is found underground in a city of ruins.

The other thing that bothered me were all the times we see Virdon & Burke surprise attack an ape and then never bother to take his rifle from him.  You'll notice it many times in the show (though sometimes they do take one now and then).  But this is small potatoes...the series is wonderful.

The only sad thing is we'll never see how it would've truly ended: Would Virdon & Burke ever get back home?  Would Galen come too?  Or would they revolutionize the ape ruled world so that apes and humans would live as equals?  There were so many ways the series could've gone.  But don't let these original 14 episodes pass you by.  The set may be short on extra features, but considering the price you pay for 14 episodes (think about how much Paramount charges for all their different Star Trek TV Series), you more than get your money's worth.

1643168,4,B00005PJ8W,"I purchased this DVD set as more of a nostalgia piece than anything else.  I was 13 years old when the series first aired on CBS (?), and even at that age I knew the show was pretty wretched.  Two bland lead human characters, a derivative 70's ""adventure melodrama of the week"" outline, poor scripting, etc..... I gave up on it after only the first couple of episodes.  But it wasn't until I had an appendix attack on one Friday evening in 1974 at a friend's house that the show was forever burned into my memory.  As I awaited for the ambulance to arrive, the TV was on and the latest episode of POTA came on.  As I laid there in pain and fear, I could not help but laugh at the image on the TV.  Our two human heroes were being menaced in the ocean by a very fake shark fin.  That thought is always associated with my recollections of that day --- a day where I ended up in the emergency room and went straight into operation.  I lived, of course, and now the long obscure POTA series lives again on DVD.  The episode with the shark was #6 and the new Fox DVD set even indicates that it originally aired on Oct. 18, 1974 ....it's great to know the date of that eventful evening, bringing it all back to me over 25 years later (oh my).
However, having now viewed 8 of the 14 episodes on the beautifully packaged DVD set (what an amazing 4-disc keepcase!), I have a better appreciation of the series overall.  Ya, it still falls into that 70's TV adventure formula, and ya, the 2 leads are as bland as can be (no fault of the actors), but it does grow on you if you stick with it.  The first couple of episodes are pretty wretched, but out of the 8 I've watched so far, a few of them are actually pretty good...and I'm anxious to watch the rest.  So I bought it as nostalgia, but it's surprisingly much more than just that.  Some of the bad scripting just makes it more fun in that innocent 70's TV way.  And after that bloated godawful Tim Burton remake, this TV series looks like GOLD in comparison.
So go in with an open mind, laugh at the studio sets, cringe at the silly dialog or ridiculous plot developments....and just have a good time!  Of course, this series would never have seen a homevideo release if not for the recent remake, so if that awful piece of celluloid accomplished anything, it was that it opened the floodgates for this great set.  Now, if only MGM would remake ""Logan's Run"" so we can get that short-lived TV series (another one I gave up on after 2 or 3 episodes) on DVD --- that would be the end all.  It's a long-shot, but Anything can happen...",1006387200,4,2575,4.243852459016393
1643169,5,B00005PJ8W,"I purchased this mainly out of a sense of nostalgia, but stand quite surprised. The quality Fox put into it is praise worthy. I was expecting some quick, cheap knock off to cash in on the DVD  release of Tim Burton's version of Planet of the Apes, but the audio and visual quality are awesome. The whole set is handsomely packaged (though I have a sneaking suspicion the case may be susceptible to wear quite quickly if you're not careful). If I had any other criticism it would be they didn't take the time to put it into 5:1 surround, but the rest of it is so great and the price so reasonable I'm quite willing to let that go.
If you are an ""Apes"" fan, this is a must purchase. Prior to this there were only occasional bouts of it from the SciFi channel and reminiscing from certain web sites.
""Planet of the Apes - The Complete TV Series"" is an excellent value. When I compare this to many other DVD box sets I have I am astonished at receiving so much for so (comparitively) so little.",1006300800,9,990,4.26595744680851

1643171,5,B00005PJ8W,"I got lucky, the first Ape film I actually saw, on my local network TV station, was the original PoA's with Heston. I was 12.  And I then saw Beneath and on(excluding Escape my network didn't show it for some reason).  Also, the first time I saw this Ron Harper/James Naughton series was when it was shown on my local netwark as five movies with quite a bit of stuff cut out(that's an understatement!).  I then saw it about a year or two ago on sci-fi and saw episodes I didn't even know existed!  Wow!  What a treat!  Those added episodes brought more believability to the show, and the Ape Epoch.
I recorded the first episode on a VCR, but the picture quality was terrible because the unit was faulty.  I definitely want this set.  And have already pre-ordered!!!",1003276800,3,765,4.453237410071942
1643172,4,B00005PJ8W,"I was shocked to see this title announced, especially from Fox.  I have nothing against Fox, but their focus has been the release of their high profile television programs on DVD.  Of course, the unanticipated success of the EVOLUTION set and the release of a theatrical ""reimagining"" may have helped some smart executive take a shot at this series.
The plot of the series is basically the same as the first APES film.  A ship crashes and two astronauts have to survive on a planet dominated by talking apes.  Roddy McDowall stars a Galen, a sympathetic chimpanze who helps them.  Mark Leonard (from STAR TREK) plays a gorilla who is out to stop the humans.
The Fox Movie Channel has played some cut up episodes of this show as movies.  The picture quality was terrible.  However, I'm sure Fox has cleaned these episodes for the DVD release (and the BEHIND THE PLANET OF THE APES documentary would indicate that there are some excellent film sources out there.).
While the show was a bit repetitive (a problem with most adventure series), it was a fairly serious science fiction television series with a focus on the characters.  The humans could talk on the show, so it bears a small similarity to the 2001 film.  Sadly, the show was cancelled after 13 episodes.  Even the original Star Trek really didn't get rolling until the second half of the first season.",1000166400,10,1361,4.70464135021097

7949414,5,B00005PJ8W,"This 1974 series aired on CBS following the success of the APJAC/20th Century Fox film series of five movies from 1968-1973. Like the films, the premise stems from Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel ""La Plante des Singes"", which features a world in which apes rule and humans serve. Like the first and second film, a group of astronauts in deep space encounter a time warp and travel to Earth's future. In this case, they arrive in the year 3085 (though the ship's chronometer may have stopped working). This places the events of this show about 900 years before the first film, though Dr. Zaius implies that the series takes places 10 years after the first film (which doesn't make sense as the Earth was destroyed in the second, but it's best not to overthink this). Unlike the feature films, the humans in this series can speak, though ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" (1973) included a framing device sometime around 2650 that featured speaking humans.
The astronauts in this series are Alan Virdon and Peter Burke (played by Ron Harper and James Naughton). Like the films, they team up with a sympathetic chimpanzee named Galen (played by Roddy McDowall, who appeared in 4 of the 5 feature films that preceded the series). Unlike the films, especially the last three (""Escape from the Planet of the Apes"" [1971], ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" [1972], and ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" [1973]), this series doesn't serve much as an allegory for racial conflict. Instead, it follows the formula of other 1970s and 1980s series, with the main characters seeking a way to return to their own time while traveling and helping various villages they encounter. There are still explorations of the conflict between apes and men as well as the history of the planet, but most stories are relatively self-contained and deal with issues such as honor, family, and more. It also feels much more optimistic than the final two films in the original series of movies.
Unfortunately, poor ratings led CBS to cancel this show after 14 episodes, only 13 of which aired in the U.S. This was the final live-action ""Planet of the Apes"" production until Tim Burton's reboot in 2001. There was an last addition to the original chronology with the 1975-1976 NBC animated series (which had modern vehicles as in Boulle's novel), but this is a good coda to the films. This DVD set includes all 14 episodes plus trailers for the show. A must-have for fans of the franchise!",1514592000,,2459,4.774647887323944
7949415,4,B00005PJ8W,"I bought this only because it was so cheap I couldn't resist. I knew it would be lackluster compared to the films from that era. But it did have some good stories and hit on a lot of social conscious story lines despite the low production budgets to be expected back in the day. As is so common in the past (and even still today with regard to some projects) , there are inconsistencies of logic and time frame compared to the films that preceded this TV show. The show takes place in the year 3084 AD (according to the title credit sequence) while the first film takes place in 3955 AD. It is clearly stated in one early episode that the events of the original PLANET film is referenced and that talking humans appeared and that the Apes managed to suppress the event and turn it into a myth rather than fact. In this show humans talk, with rather contemporary speech and hair styles, 900 years before the events of the 1st film. Logical background info delivered through dialogue doesn't cost an extra penny in regard to production cost. Just bad/sloppy writing, no other excuse. Probably the main reason , I suspect,  the show was canned mid season.  The cheap budget didn't help that matter. If it wasn't for the existing props and costumes left over from the films I doubt they would have green lit this show in the 1st place. But I have to say, even in this show the ape make-up is very good and carries the show.
 If you can pick it up on sale it is worth having in the collection, if you're an Apes of a sci-fi fan.",1510790400,,1523,4.336842105263158
