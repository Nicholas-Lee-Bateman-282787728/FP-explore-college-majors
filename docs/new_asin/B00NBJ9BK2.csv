8677246,4,B00NBJ9BK2,"I bought this DVD long time ago. It even didn`t contain an official box with coverart yet. The reason why I bought it - let`s be honest - is because Eartha Kitt acts in it , in one of her very first roles. This was produced for TV and not for the cinema. Quality is just soso, black & white , not really good. The acting , especially of Roddy McDowell is good. Eartha had a rather smallish part in it as an African princess . As a collector of ALL Eartha Kitt stuff , I am happy to own this . The play itself I didn`l like very well, and maybe it is just too ""artsy"" for me .I could not keep my mind to the plot during this film .",1425081600,4,630,3.7803030303030303
