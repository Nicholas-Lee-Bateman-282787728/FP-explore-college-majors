8463349,5,B005AKK7QC,My nephew loved it. They don't make the German language set anymore.. Nice doing business with you.,1433289600,,99,4.882352941176471
8463350,5,B005AKK7QC,"The whole family watches these -- the cartoons seem corny and primitive, but the story lines are surprisingly memorable, the characters are expressive, and the German words get remembered.  Best for teaching pronunciation -- the slightly exaggerated speech, the repetition, and the somewhat bizarre song sequences get us saying the words out loud and laughing.  Fun to share this together with your kids, so you are in on the joke.",1324598400,,431,5.142857142857143
8463351,5,B005AKK7QC,"This product is thoughtfully made to catch the attention and introduce the language in a very simple way for the little ones. My daughter does watch the stories until they finish with concentration. But compared to the disney movies for kids now a days, these dvd's are a little bit boring for my 5 y. old. Altough she seems to catch up on the language, after the first 2 times she has been watching. We have not tried the interactive programm yet.",1316822400,,448,4.475609756097561
