8195685,1,B0000YWR0C,"I think the material on this DVD is pretty basic and pretty much for begginers.

although I like Dan's teaching way and he knows his way with Lightwave he could kept Motions in Background only in one Volume. Volumetrics (Vol 1) is a way more complex and complete topic to cover. On Volume 2 he covers procedural textures which are easier to experiment with and easier to find things out, covering this topic on 75 minutes seems too much, there was too much room available to fit another related topic.

This is for begginers only. But I repeat: I don't have anything against the way Dan teaches his thing, he does a good job there...it was just a matter of choosing more interesting/complex examples.

it is not possible that even the tips and shortcuts are the same ones he gives on Vol 1. I would understand that if we were talking about different series, but not on the same collection.",1097539200,,889,4.54375
