8014119,5,B0001LJC6Q,This DVD is a reminder of the days gone bye. Love the Giant's /Dodgers  stories. But the George Brett / George Steinbrenner story made me Laugh. G. Brett is still my favorite!.,1363305600,,176,4.5
8014120,5,B0001LJC6Q,I finally watched this movie today and loved it. It educated me on more than just my loved Red Sox Yankee rivalry. Like the dodgers and the yanks and the giants and the light hearted cubs cards. But it needs an amendem to the Sox Yanks rivalry where the Yanks finally lost to the Red Sox and the red sox finally won the world series against another world series rival the St Louis Cardinals who beat us in 46 and 67. So good docu but needs an update,1103587200,3,449,4.113636363636363
