7902707,3,B000003K98,"Quark is upset, earlier he lost his trading licence which prohibits him from doing business with other Ferengi, something he misses. So he decides  to head back to Ferenginar to cheer himself up, something I don't know why  he does as he hates his mother. Any way, in a quick visit it is revealed  that Quark's mother is dating Grand Master Zek!
Brunt arrives shortly  after, the guy everyone loves-to-hate who will really start to grow on you  in this episode, he offeres Quark a deal: split up the happy couple and he  can have his licence back. Quark does but then the whole Ferengi economy  begins to fall apart, Quark realises that his mother is the one who has  'the lobes for business' and that she is the one person that is keeping the  economy going and that if she dates Zek again her influence on him will  make everything all right - again.
But getting the couple to date again  may be harder then he thought. A mediocre episode that would be a lot  better if Zek had more scenes - that guy is hilarious!",966729600,,1016,4.374331550802139
