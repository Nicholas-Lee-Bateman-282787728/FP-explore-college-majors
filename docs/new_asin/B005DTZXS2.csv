4661911,4,B005DTZXS2,"This box offers three films for a very reasonable price, but of those three only one (""Run silent, run deep"") is really good, with another one (""Beachhead"") being really bad and the third (""Beach Red"") being very average.

The box looks nice, but it is oversized when compared to the usual packing of DVDs (especially considering that there is only ONE disc inside) and therefore will stick out on the shelf. Also, it contains as a bonus a short chronology of World War II in form of a little poster - but it is really very superficial and not very pretty.

There is no subtitles of any kind, so non-native English speakers may have some trouble following up, especially with the two latter films, in which sound editing is so-so.

As for the films themselves, here are my impressions, with some SPOILERS.
-----------------------------------------
RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP (1958): A good war film about an US submarine, her controversial skipper and their very eventful combat patrol...

Made in 1958 this is an old black and white film with rather poor effects, but a very interesting scenario and two great actors at the top of their abilities. I spend a pleasant evening watching it.

This film is an adaptation of a novel with the same title by an US Navy officer, Commander Edward L. Beach, who really served on US submarines during Pacific War. The novel was a bestseller in Unites States in 1955. The film however is greatly different from the novel, and especially doesn't show a horrible scene, in which an US submarine rams a lifeboat full of Japanese survivors...

The main hero of the story is Commander Richardson (Clark Gable) whose submarine was sunk by Japanese when he was attacking a convoy in Bungo Straits, a channel between Shikoku and Kyushu islands. In the film this place is frequently called ""The Cemetery"", as numerous US submarines were already lost there. But it is also a place through which Japanese convoys sail regularly and therefore a dreamed hunting ground for a submarine.

The film begins when Commander Richardson gets a second chance and receives the command of another ship, submarine USS ""Nerka"" - this is a fictional name, as the only US warship which was supposed to be named so, a submarine of ""Balao"" class never entered service (the contract for her construction was cancelled in 1944).

Richardson quickly finds himself at odds with his executive officer, Lieutenant Jim Bledsoe (Burt Lancaster) who was supposed to command the USS ""Nerka"" and was enraged when his promotion was cancelled and his command given to another. Unlike in the book, almost all of the film happens during just one combat patrol, which will take the submarine and her crew to the Bungo Straits, where the Japanese Imperial Navy has many surprises for the Americans...

There is a lot of action in this film and the fighting scenes, as another reviewer very rightly noticed, are not always very credible. But still, I found the naval fights very dramatic and in some moments this film really keeps you on edge, even if the special effects clearly show their age.

Dialogs are another strong point of this film and the tension between both top officers are an occasion to admire two great actors who are both at the top of their game. The scuttlebutt raging amongst the crew is another treasure of this film...)))

So bottom line this is a very good old war movie, which certainly aged a little, but still is a very nice watch. Enjoy!
---------------------------------------------
BEACHHEAD (1954) A rather bad WW II western - with just the Japanese replacing the Indians

This 1954 war film disappointed me considerably and in some of its silliest moments even made me laugh out loud.

The story begins reasonably well. It is October 1943 and the invasion of Japanese held large island of Bougainville in Solomon Islands by allied forces is imminent. In order to confuse the Japanese, a diversion is made by the landing of a battalion of US Marines on Choiseul, another large island near Bougainville. Such an operation really took place on 28 October 1943, three days before the invasion of Bougainville and therefore this film is initially based on real events.

Very quickly however the scenario goes south. Soon after the landing on Choiseul we see four (yes, just four!) Marines being send on a supposedly absolutely CRUCIAL mission which will take them into a part of island filled with Japanese troops, when in the same time like one hundred other Marines are send to do some other, clearly less important stuff... The four guys are Sergeant Fletcher (Frank Lovejoy), a veteran who served already 20 years in USMC and three simple soldiers, much younger but already also hardened veterans of Guadalcanal campaign: Burke (Tony Curtis), Reynolds (Skip Homeier) and Biggerman (Alan Wells).

I will not say much about the rest of the story, but at one moment a cute damsel in distress will also appear, played by Mary Murphy (mostly known for being Marlon Brando's co-star in ""The Wild One""). She plays Nina Bouchard, the daughter of a local French planter, who hid in the jungle for the last 20 months - and still wears a sexy dress, has an excellent haircut and a discreet but stylish makeup...))) Later on, the dress will progressively get ripped in some strategic places, enough to show some nice skin, but just not enough to upset the censors (this is a 1954 film...).

The problem with this film is the silliness of the scenario which actually made me frequently laugh in moments which were supposedly extremely dramatic. Here are the best or rather the worse of them:

- Japanese main command and communication post is in a house in the middle of a plain, decorated with an extra-large flag, just in case some American planes failed to see it...

- at one moment we visit a Japanese position which was ""abandoned so fast, that they left behind personal effects and couldn't even finish this cup of sake""; but just before leaving, the previous occupants had the time to comprehensively booby trap the whole place with extremely elaborate bombs...

- a simple private keeps insulting, abusing and even hitting (!) his Sergeant, a large burly man with 20 years of service in Leathernecks behind him - and the latter doesn't even object...)))

- no matter how much heat the Japanese pack (they even have tanks!), their favourite way of attacking is with KNIVES!

- Japanese just adore fighting shirtless, with their torso bared, except when they appear in large formations - then, everybody is in full uniform

- Tony Curtis sinks a Japanese destroyer (!) with one hand grenade and a little bit of oil...)))

- when a sniper shoots one of your soldiers, the way to deal with the situation is to all stand in the open, with the person in command holding a pistol in hand and therefore showing who is the most important target; then for a couple of minutes let's discuss the situation without even trying to hide...

- it is possible to send a message from a Japanese radio in their own headquarters when they are all busy doing something else...

- when being near an American invading force, a whole platoon of Japanese will strip naked and take a bath, leaving weapons and uniforms on the shore, without even posting a guard...

- even the smallest river craft, barely able to carry eight guys, must display a Japanese flag large enough for a battleship (it is not an exaggeration)

- Japanese soldiers fight to death, but sailors from Imperial Japanese Navy surrender on first sight of the enemy...)))

There also is in this film a scene of death of one of American soldiers which is so ridiculous that I place it without hesitation in my personal top three most stupid death scenes ever! And the general atmosphere is that of a low budget western about a group of people lost in the wilderness when running from hostile Indians - it's just that here the bad guys have some better weapons...

Bottom line, this is one of the silliest war movies I ever saw and I now understand better why it is so little known - it is simply because it doesn't deserve to be known more... God only knows how could anybody convince Tony Curtis, a very good actor, to play in this thing. Watchable only for most devoted Tony Curtis fans or people making a study of war B movies from the 50s. Otherwise avoid it as tropical plague.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
BEACH RED (1967) A film of unequal quality, mixing in equal proportions good and bad moments

I found this 1967 war film watchable, but nothing else.

This film describes the fight for a large island during Pacific War and follows the tribulations of one company of USMC and their Japanese adversaries. The place of action is never named, we just know that the beach on which this one company lands is code named ""Red"". The island is however very large and as we know also that the initial stage of Bougainville Campaign (November-December 1943) is already over, the battle described here could be that of Saipan (June-July 1944) or Guam (July-August 1944).

The film begins with the landing itself, which is opposed immediately on the beaches and costs Americans some casualties - but is nowhere near as hellish as the legendary slaughters on Tarawa or on Omaha Beach. Some reviewers claimed that this film inspired the initial sequences from ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it is unlikely - the intensity of the landing fight in ""Beach Red"" is far, far lesser than in Spielberg's master-piece.

After the initial battle the Marines move inland, meeting first an improvised line of defence with machine gun nests and then a more substantial obstacle, with pillboxes made in concrete (like on Saipan). That battle is tougher and American tanks get involved - and then we enter the jungle, with all its deadly attractions...

Cornel Wilde, who directed this film, was inspired by a novella published under the same title in 1945 by a veteran of Pacific War, but this being the Vietnam War era he changed the general tone in order to turn his film into an anti-war manifesto - and that didn't do this movie any good. Elements of rather crude and simplistic psychological analysis were added in form of soldier's reminiscences of their families at home, like in the much earlier, lavishly budgeted and stars-stuffed ""Halls of Montezuma"" - and exactly like in this former film, here they are more ridiculous than anything else...

Cornel Wilde plays also here the main role of captain MacDonald, the commanding officer of the whole company - but honestly, a great actor he was not and I found his performance rather weak and as the result his character was not very credible. I already had the occasion to notice the same thing in other Wilde's film, ""Constantin and the Cross""... Other actors were unknown to me, but they did better, with especially Rip Torn playing very well a tough USMC NCO, Sergeant Honeywell.

There is a lot of fighting in this film and most of those fighting scenes were good, with the initial landing and the fight agains pillboxes being the best. This film was turned on Philippines and local army gave considerable help, including some M-41 Walker Bulldogs light tanks, which albeit posterior to WWII can to some extent pretend to be long-gunned versions of M-4 Shermans...

On another hand the portrayal of the Japanese was rather substandard. In an attempt to show the preparation for a ""banzai"" charge Wilde mustered hundreds of Philippino soldiers - but they all wear old American uniforms and M1903 Springfield rifles and as result those scenes are not very credible... Also, Wilde decided against subtitling in English what Japanese are saying and therefore had to ask the ""officers"" to gesticulate a lot so the viewer can understand what is it that they mean - the final result is rather pathetic and weird as the Japanese in this film use their hands to communicate a little like cavemen in ""Quest for Fire""...

The portrayal of Pacific War and soldiers who wage it are in this film considerably influenced by the anti-war Vietnam-era ideology - and that anachronism hurts this film a lot, mostly by eliminating all kind of humour. There are only two very short scenes in which any humour is present - the rest of the film is mostly fighting and preaching about how bad it is to fight...

Only one scene in this film was really great and moved me a lot - it shows two critically wounded soldiers, one Japanese and one American. They fell very close one to another, there is nobody else alive around and they both are aware that they are dying... That was a really good one.

But some good fighting and a couple of other nice scenes nonobstant, this is ultimately a rather average film. Watchable, but nothing more.

CONCLUSION: Even if the quality of the two latter films is really not so great, ""Run silent, run deep"" alone is well worth the price of purchase of this box - and the two other films can be simply considered as bonus in ""special features"".",1391385600,2,13045,4.8218442256042975

4661940,4,B005DTZXS2,"I got this oldies set for Run Silent, Run Deep, which I remember enjoying with my dad.  The others were an added bonus and both were excellent in their own ways.  THis along with Westerns and monster movies were the stuff I grew up on, so I love these.

RSRD is a classic on submarine warfare, in which an innovator tries to realize his vision to fight in a particularly difficult circumstance.  THough I doubt it would pass the test of military historians, the acting of Clark Gable and Lancaster are simply fabulous, as are member of the crew who fear yet trust their captain.

Beachhead is the story of a crew on a hazardous mission in the Pacific, with very high casualties.  Though they start out distrusting their commander, the survivors come to a mutual respect and renewed sense of mission.  It doesn't help that the daughter of a French farmer they rescue speaks with an American accent, but she is endearing nonetheless.  The Japanese, it should be noted, appear as killing automatons.

Find Beach Red, of the 1960s, is a very different kind of film.  At each encounter, many of them deadly, the viewer gets flashes of who the people are on both sides, with flashbacks to farms and such.  Perhaps with the sensibilities arising from the war in Vietnam, viewers expected more empathy in war films.  THough the recollections often disrupt the flow of narrative, I found many of them quite moving.

Recommended.  It is an excellent value, the films are good and very different, and the acting good.",1476748800,,1506,4.698473282442748
