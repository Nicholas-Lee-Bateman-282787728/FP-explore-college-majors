I don't know what happened. Maybe the writing staff was changed or the director was replaced. It was actually painful to watch this drama unfold from greatness to mediocrity.

The first 14 episodes are great because it is about struggling and overcoming against the dark side of gambling. One of the most common lines used is ""don't BS with me"". Indeed, the first 14 episodes do not BS with its audience and provides the grim reality of the Korean underground gambling world full of cheaters, loan-sharks, desperate suckers, and cleaver wielding finger/hand choppers.  ""Why do you gamble?"" asks the main antagonist. The protagonist answers ""because I want to help my friend"". The antagonist retorts ""don't BS with me or yourself, you gamble because you love money and what it can bring you"". We all like to think we have higher ideals, but isn't it often just an attempt to BS ourselves and the world around us to think we are better than what we really are? This drama makes you think.

How does the protagonist become a Tazza (top winning gambler)? He masters, through much tribulation, the nuisance of not only the game, but also his opponents. Winning in gambling, and indeed life, is about understanding people (including oneself) and their mindset and tendencies. Understand your opponent and you would find his/her actions are predictable.

The last 6 episodes, however, are pure facade and fiction. The protagonist's buddies are all go out of their way to help him, at the great risk of landing themselves in jail, just because they believe in helping a friend. Unicorns the protagonist seems to find everywhere he goes. Moreover, they team-up and manage to destroy couple of major casino operations by bribing bunch of employees, who doesn't seem to have any inclination of reporting such activities to their bosses. Lastly, the antagonist suddenly becomes clueless and stupid. How convenient that must be for the protagonist and the writers of this drama who needed to make sense of their web of improbabilities which they have entangled to make a total farce of an ending.

All this is too bad.

Pros:
1)First 14 or so episodes are masterpieces. Mind you, they are dark. But they are also real in terms of the motivations of different characters. The drama is not afraid to dig deep into the mindset of each character and what drives them.
2)Mostly unforgettable characters.

Cons:
1)The last 6 episodes are a farce. The drama somehow manages to degenerate into mediocrity.
2)The last 6 episodes have mostly forgettable and unbelievable characters the drama would have been much better without.",1409184000,,2768,4.963282937365011
