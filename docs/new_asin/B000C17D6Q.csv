It only cost about $18.00 and I would love to have a copy, no wait purchase a copy. Can I have one please? I have been trying to get this movie for about six  months, but I missed out and you ran out of copies. I didn't even get mine and now you say you may not get anymore, how is that fair? I have to have a copy of this movie and it is available on the amazon Canada web site. HELP! If I had to rate it, I would give it 5 stars! I know an excellent movie when I read about and the actor Roy Dupuis is the tops!",1352419200,,643,3.6594202898550723

I bought this movie becaue of Roy Dupuis being in it.  It is a very depressing movie.  Although Roy is the only one that brings any kind of quality to the movie.  Jane McGreggor trys, but still comes off as an amature when reading her lines, she should probably just stay with those girlie movies she is known for, because she stinks in this one!  Sorry to be so harsh but there it is. I liked the music and the scenery,looks a lot like New England or CT.  All in all.  I would not buy this movie if it wasn't for Roy Dupuis. It just felt depressing and the fact that Conk really had no life of his own, probably due to the ending.  I read somewhere that Roy did this movie because it was near his home.  I guess he did it for the money?",1196985600,,903,4.8881578947368425

8095021,5,B000C17D6Q,"I am so glad that Jeremy Peter Allen posted here that this movie had an English version so that I would check it out! I am not going to go in to a long character study or spoil the film for you---just want you to know that the acting was amazing and it really touched me profoundly.  I have seen other movies about this subject matter and although I watched them and was moved, this one actually made me feel anxious and fearful. I started really thinking how a condemned person must be feeling when they are walking those final steps... (I also wondered how Roy Dupuis could do some of the scenes without hyperventilating, which is how I felt watching it!) So, regardless of your beliefs about capital punishment, this is a movie that will make you think...Everyone involved made a great picture and I think the director should be proud! The film has also encouraged me to look for more of Yann Martel's writing! ***Thank you, JPA for the deleted scene that was ""too controversial"" for the public--it was a ""standout!""  (I have learned, too, that if RD is in a film, look for Greg Hlady.  His character roles always add flavor!)

I give the movie 5 stars--check it out! (It's definitely worth the money and will stay in my personal library!)",1172361600,5,1242,4.53125
