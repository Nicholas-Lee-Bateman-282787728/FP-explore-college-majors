4532819,2,B0052Y0FLI,"Ahhh, I hate being so critical of somebody doing a documentary, but I was really disappointed with this one. The first hour is filled with many problems. For example, the first discussion we have from people involves saying how crappy it is that everyone can download music, and then the next discussion immediately afterwards praises the fact that music can be shared so easily via the internet. In between these two contradictory viewpoints is senseless little art pieces set to some music by artists that I was HOPING to see and get to know but never do. Along with this, there were many instances where the documentary began to explore a band, such ass the Zoobombs, and then nothing. Not even a performance by them really. By the end of the first hour that was filled with the aforementioned plus segue way pieces that tried really hard to look and feel avant-garde but ended up just being a bunch of shots of Tokyo and drawings and je ne sais quoi, I realized I wasted my money.

The only reason why I even gave it two stars is because at around the hour point, the doc actually starts to feel like a doc. We get to see a few venues that were interesting, such as enban, and we even get to hear a band talk and then see a performance by the band aftewards. The problem is by this time, it's already too late into the doc for me to even care. Add to that the doc picked some of the worst underground musicians I've ever heard in my life, and you have me wishing I could not only refund my money, but refund the time I wasted watching this. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm all about underground music. I was an underground hardcore musician myself for many years, but these artists need to realize that noise and blending styles doesn't always equal interesting or avant-garde or important. It usually equals a bunch of people that are just trying to be different for the sake of being different. I suppose out these types somebody might emerge with something innovative, such as Oshiro in this doc, but at the same time, music is meant to be felt, something that saturates into your soul and doesn't let go. I find it incredibly ironic that some of these musicians who worship American rock idols forget that those rock idols stuck with the basics: guitar, amps, drums, and great song-writing all around. Where the heck was that in ANY of these musician's performances?",1384214400,3,2374,4.52093023255814
4532820,5,B0052Y0FLI,"Director Lewis Rapkin immerses the viewer in the hyper sensory world of the underground Tokyo music scene in this stellar documentary. With a focus on colorful characters and atmospheres, this film portrays the lesser known niches of Tokyo's music via interviews, music videos, live performances and evocative images of the metropolis' neon nightlife. Buoyant yet informative, this doc is must view for fans of emerging music and Japanese cultural enthusiasts alike.",1314662400,2,466,5.577464788732394
4532821,5,B0052Y0FLI,"The director and his team immersed themselves in the Tokyo music scene, and captured a unique and vivid view of the culture and dedication of these musicians.  The film contrasts daily life in Tokyo with the vibrant after hours life in music venues.  It provides a look at the pay-to-play performance model, where bands pay clubs to perform, and how that drives an unusual dedication to their art.

The film shows a beautiful panoramic backdrop of Tokyo, and introduces the audience to many of the up and coming hot bands from Japan, and the characters that own and operate the venues.  The music, the imagery and the commentary are blended into a highly entertaining film.",1314230400,5,673,4.826086956521739
8454794,5,B0052Y0FLI,"This is for music nerds. At the end of the day, it's an amateur documentary with a great subject and good material. The main problem that it has (outside of choppy direction), is that the performances featured are too short. So why five stars? Because it offers something new... well, at least something niche. I appreciate that, and am really glad this was made!",1512086400,,363,4.6875
8454795,3,B0052Y0FLI,"The movie focused on a specific genre on musicians trying to discover a ""new sound"". Having lived in Tokyo for many years I did not think it covered the music scene in Tokyo so much as the new sounds and entertainers attempting to bring it to the people. There are tidbits of info that I was unaware of, such as musicians having to pay to perform. Had It's moments.",1507161600,,365,4.304347826086956
8454796,2,B0052Y0FLI,"I'm American, and it was Japanese rock, and hip hop that got me into the American original versions. This documentary did not capture the true talent of Japan musically. How do you not mention the late Jun Sabes aka Nujabes? This artists has taken jazz, hip hop, etc. and has made some of the coolest and chill music ever! He is a legend in the United States. And J rock bands like People in the Box have a rock style that I prefer over American. And what about Meiko Kaji? Her style of music rivals even surpasses similar styles found in Latin America. I guess this would be called ballad or something. If Japan is struggling musically, which seems to be the case albeit due to this documentary. Remember true music is always made best when it comes from your collective experience, culture etc. What I saw and heard in this documentary is nothing that makes me want to listen to Japanese music. Luckily for me, my itunes library is full of Japanese artists that I find the best in the world. I even have traditional Japanese music- but, I always wonder what it would sound like if someone tried to make a modern version.",1501545600,,1122,4.478048780487805
8454797,3,B0052Y0FLI,Have seen better productions on this subject.  Audio seemed overamped and distorted. For sure not my type of music but was interesting to see what the Japanese are up to now days.`,1466467200,,180,4.625
8454798,3,B0052Y0FLI,I liked hearing the different bands that are playing in Tokyo but I thought the documentary was too jumpy. I understand that it was supposed to be the esthetic mimicking Tokyo's face paced world but I still found it distracting.,1462665600,,228,4.725
8454799,5,B0052Y0FLI,Really interesting. Learned about some new bands.,1457222400,,49,6.142857142857143

Underground feel but clean
Randomize your life
Japan bands are rad",1453507200,,83,5.461538461538462
8454802,5,B0052Y0FLI,A surprisingly little gem of a doc on the Tokyo music scene. Provides an interesting glimpse into the culture and energy of the underground music of Tokyo. The artistic photography and editing rises this program above the usual documentary. Recommended!,1417564800,,253,5.35
8454803,1,B0052Y0FLI,"I stopped watching after the first half hour. If you're watching this to learn a little bit more about the Tokyo music scene - there is extremely little of worth.
- 2-3 minutes Begins talking about mp3s vs CD and that it hurts music sales.
- 2-3 minutes How Japanese music has no tradition only an amalgamation of imitating other countries with Japanese culture.
- 25-28 of Japanese underground bands playing ""outsider"" music.

If this is how you wish to spend an hour and twenty minutes, be my guest.",1400630400,2,501,4.629213483146067
