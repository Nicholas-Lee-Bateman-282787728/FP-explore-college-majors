1224903,4,B00000INCK,"I love Red Green and this is a fun DVD, the only problem is with the audio. It fluctuates a lot, up and down. Even so, no one is like Red and the Possum Lodge crew. Excellent programs in the festive spirit. Enjoy!",1481760000,,213,3.9767441860465116

1224908,4,B00000INCK,"This is a low-brow, relaxing, humorous Red Green (PBS TV) Show Christmas CD.  The eccentric crew is here, showing off their zany antics to make a ""one horse"" K car, to chop down a Christmas tree, to decorate a Christmas tree, and to guess what is in a wrapped gift.  As Red Green enthusiasts already know, none of this happens in a typical fashion- hazardous and inept are their mottoes.  Duct tape remains a handyman's answer to nearly all problems in the North Country.  For some of the best slapstick humor from Canada, this CD makes a fun present which can be watched each Christmas, and, ahem, whose content will never go out of style, as it was never in style in the first place.  While portions are probably not for young children, this classic is otherwise fully recommended for the handyman, or rustic family in your life.",1451001600,3,831,4.587837837837838

1224942,5,B00000INCK,"Oh how I miss watching Red Green. This DVD is now part of my ""must watch"" list at Christmas...and my list is short (3 movies). If you love Red Green as I do, you will love this.",1427673600,,177,3.810810810810811
1224943,5,B00000INCK,"If you're an American who loves Canadian humor, then the Red Green Christmas special is worth watching. Ever since I was a child, I grew up watching Red Green on Saturday nights, even if the show was in reruns. Nowadays, Steve Smith, who plays the title role as Red, is on tour to entertain fans in both Canada and the United States, so if you haven't had a chance to see him on tour, go see him live when he's on tour. It's worth the money and you'll also get a chance to meet him in person for an autograph and get your picture taken with him.",1421712000,,545,4.102803738317757

1224945,5,B00000INCK,"We had this on VHS from years ago, and it's something we love to watch! So I was glad to be able to find it on DVD. I think it would be funny even to someone who isn't familiar with the TV show or the characters. It's pretty ""nontraditional"" as far as Christmas specials go, in that it focuses on the everyday preparation for the holiday - gift giving, selecting a tree, decorating the tree. For fans of the show - yes, there is an explosive device featured, and duct tape is mentioned. Of course!

Note to parents: Our son watched part of it and thought it was hilarious. I was a little nervous when they started talking about the existence of Santa, but they basically say that Santa does exist. And they do it in a very humorous way (Santa is a regular guy who is overweight, builds stuff, and wants snacks wherever he goes).",1419552000,2,828,4.3076923076923075

1224951,4,B00000INCK,"If you have seen the show before then you pretty much know what to expect, no cheesy important life lessons or morality issues here just good ole' clean fun. There are two episodes on the disc one is an hour long special and the other is a half hour. The only complaint I have is these constant ""filler"" clips that just have Red walking through snow in various places(parks, the town, the forest) the second episode reuses the clips from the first but doesn't add Reds monologue like in the first episode. If your a fan of the show and need something to break up the monotony of your family's favorite holiday movies and TV specials then give it a watch.",1389830400,,654,4.413223140495868

1224985,5,B00000INCK,"Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.

You have GOT to get this!  I saw the show and fell on the floor laughing.  Especially when Winston explained about getting a shovel for Christmas.  Huh, you say?  Get this and find out.

The members of Possum Lodge strike again - and Christmas will NEVER be the same.",1373155200,,368,4.402985074626866

1225023,5,B00000INCK,"Bought this as a christmas gift for my father.  We both love the show and it was nice to find the Christmas special on its very own dvd.  You definitly get your money's worth, It has two seperate hour long specials.

1225024,5,B00000INCK,"I've watched Red Green for a good number of years on TV and have found the show to be great entertainment.  This video is hysterical, even funnier than the TV show.  I received it as a birthday present and decided to buy it for three fellow Red Green fans.  All three people thoroughly enjoyed it also.  I highly recommend it!",1200096000,,326,4.383333333333334
1225025,5,B00000INCK,"Gave this to my husband for Christmas with a roll of duct tape, (Red Green fans understand) and even though the kids said it was too corny, they all sat there and tried not to laugh. A great family dvd that isn't offensive, just fun",1169164800,,232,4.177777777777778
1225026,5,B00000INCK,"What more can be said: Red + Green = Christmas!

For Red Green fans it is great. For those lost souls who are not fans, it will still be a laugh, but some of the ""in lodge"" humour may be lost to them.",1168992000,,200,3.6511627906976742
1225027,4,B00000INCK,"Our family loves Red Green, the Canadian tv show that humorously highlights the traditional role distinctions of men versus women. So we looked forward to viewing this Christmas special and we were not disappointed. Reality must be suspended to enjoy this silly, over-the-top series set in fictitious ""Possum Lodge"" where useless handyman advice and slogans fly such as ""Remember, we're all in this together...and, if the women don't find you handsome, they can at least find you handy"" Duct tape is ""the handyman's secret weapon"" and is a recurring ""fix-all"" that fixes nothing as ridiculous home improvement or vehicle alterations are made in each episode. There are running bits normally seen on the tv series included here on this special as well as seasonal advice on tree lighting and package opening. It's ridiculous and quirky and we liked it well enough to nominate it for annual Christmas season viewing in the future.",1167004800,,928,5.1118421052631575
1225028,5,B00000INCK,"I usually avoid my fave shows' ""specials"" like the plague. They never live up to expectations, they are obviously rushed into production to make a buck, etc.

I took a chance on Red Green Christmas last year, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's very funny, well written, and just as good as the shows themselves. Wait until you see how Red takes holiday dinner to the relatives...

If you love the show you won't be disappointed!",1165968000,9,430,4.644736842105263
1225029,5,B00000INCK,"I am a big Red Green fan.  I found Red Green on the PBS channel in Des Moines, IA about three years ago.  Since the first time that I've seen the show, I was a fan from then on.  Red Green is ""Home Improvement"" but going all the way to the right field.  The Christmas shows just bring out the best of the cast & crew for one the biggest holidays.  So, for anyone who is a dire hard Red Green fan, I recomend this DVD for you.",1122508800,14,425,3.784090909090909
1225030,5,B00000INCK,"Red Green has grown on me like a fungus!  This show seems to be an original that was made with the holidays in mind.  Lots of funny Xmas spoofs and take-offs here.  Also some amusing reflective notes for the Season as well.  Red Green will apppeal to almost anyone who likes silly, dry humor. There is also a lot for women to learn here about the male psyche.  The intelligent woman will laugh at the show, but also understand some of its ironic wisdom about men. There is nothing abou this series that it pretencious.  Perhaps that's what makes it so appealing as compared to most other sleek comedies today that try so hard to be sophisticated and politically correct.  Red Green will have none of it!  As Red says in the beginning, just sit back, lower your standards and enjoy!",1072828800,,781,4.48936170212766
