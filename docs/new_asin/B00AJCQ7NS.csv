5440158,5,B00AJCQ7NS,"Roustabout (with the legendary Barbara Stanwyck), Girls! Girls! Girls! (one of Elvis' most fun fun fun movies), Fun In Acapulco (with Ursula Andress - Honey Ryder From Dr. No & A Honda Superhawk 305 and all that cliff diving!!!) and last but not least G.I. Blues the film Elvis made upon returning from his Army Stint.

Four top drawer Elvis movies for a song!  You can't beat this deal for Elvis at his movie best!!  Each movie on its own disc and all of them anamorphic (enhanced for widescreen TVs).  That's about $3.00 a movie as of this writing.  They look great and they sound great!",1426291200,16,589,4.518867924528302
