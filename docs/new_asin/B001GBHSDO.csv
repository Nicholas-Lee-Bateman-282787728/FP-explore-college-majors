3598538,5,B001GBHSDO,good price to see great acting done  by burt lancaster and the cast that brings the story of moses to life.,1362787200,,107,4.095238095238095
3598539,5,B001GBHSDO,"Though the 141 minute US edited version arrived first, to my delight in this case, since such actors as Burt Lancaster and Anthony Quayle had marvelous voices, this is NOT dubbed into Spanish (though I can get by in that language as well) but the original 300 minute miniseries in English and compatible with both regions 1 and 4, meaning you don't need to get any PAL system to play this puppy.  Though the picture is limited to the tight, cube TV picture for which the miniseries was produced originally, the picture quality is really very excellent -- lovely.  Thugh for those of us very familiar with the story of Moses as given in the Bible, we will recognize some liberties taken with the story though overall much of the essence is still there and very enjoyable if one is willing to give some allowances for the fact that this is a secular production and not made by those for whom every aspect of the story is literally sacred.  Lancaster is truly magnificent and at the top of his artistic powers in tis production.  Quayle ia marvelous as well andperhaps not one whit behind Lancaster in his role.  The cast is quite excellent in general and the production value really quite exquisite.  Though, if it was ever even filmed tis way, a letterbox version comes to mind, this was certainly intended for the small screen and such a reversal would likly destroy the director's composition of shots just as a widescreen production placed in pan-and-scan does mischief to a widescreen composition. I believe we must recognize this and forget all dreams of a widescreen version which probably never existed or at least for which format it was likely not composed.",1330646400,6,1665,4.724137931034483
3598540,1,B001GBHSDO,"The costumes and sets aren't too bad, but otherwise this looks like a bad TV movie from the 70s usually does. I agree that there is less of the melodrama than in Cecil DeMille's film, but the writing and acting are still painful to watch, and the picture is always dark. It must be that people feel nostalgic about something from years gone by, because this movie looks so very bad compared to classics of the past and modern filmmaking.",1326240000,,437,4.475
8304747,5,B001GBHSDO,Last 30 minutes of the movie is the best dialog ever! So well written. Love this movie. Also this is the 300 minute version,1522972800,,123,4.166666666666667

8304749,5,B001GBHSDO,Very good movie of the most faithful that I have seen to the bible.,1492819200,,67,3.857142857142857

8304751,5,B001GBHSDO,"FYI This is not the Ten Commandment, as the cover pic suggests. It is infact the saga of MOSES THE LAW GIVER, as the back panel of cover suggests. Funny.  Anyways, I highly recomend that you purchase this one if you have NTSC tv (if you're not in Europe for example).  The only alteration from the original is the addition of Spanish subtitles and Spanish words on the menu screen, which you can easily decipher. (I mean, ""opciones""...).  I had previously bought the feature-length release, and now I have the full thing.  It was totally worth it getting the full thing!! No problems with the dvds... except I think I remember a hick-up at the beginning. Evidently, if it was there, it's very negligible.

As for the movie production... If you think The Ten commandments was a good movie, you really need to watch this. I mean cause TTC was a lousy depiction of who Moses was.  I don't know why tv broadcast companies play that every year around easter. They should stop making such a farce of Biblical history.

In this production, Burt Lancaster did a phenominal job. The supporting cast was fine. But the Pharoah stunk it up big time. I forget what the actor's name was, but I like to call him Elbow-neck.  I like how this production made available to the audiance a rational portrayal of how events came into play.",1453248000,,1318,4.578723404255319
8304752,5,B001GBHSDO,Thoroughly enjoyed this version of the filmic Exodus. Far superior to the De MIlle version. Burt Lancaster is brilliant as Moses. The dialogue is intellectual and the screenplay is for the most part very faithful to the Bible story.,1431648000,,232,4.9743589743589745

8304754,5,B001GBHSDO,This DVD  set is great. Complete and in ENGLISH.,1409097600,,48,4.333333333333333
8304755,5,B001GBHSDO,"Based on other comments, I'm not alone in having hoped for years to be able to get a ""full"" version of this TV miniseries. Though seemingly this ""extended"" version is still not a full version, it's FAR better than the 140 minute bare bones version released for America. I'm just happy to get this 300 minute version, so am giving it five stars. However, after ordering it, I found that the full 360 minute version is available, but only for other (British?) regions.....BUT that there is supposedly a way to de-code your player to accept any region's DVDs. Can not seem to get a 100% confirmation of this, however, and so am not willing to mess with my player until I do so. I am thankful to the Mexicans who made this DVD to play in both their and our region. I had also expected (based on some review/comment) to have to watch the movie with Spanish subtitles, but they are coded rather than imprinted and all you have to do is use your subtitle button on the remote and turn them off ! The picture quality is obviously not HD, and didn't expect it to be. It's like watching the original broadcast on analog tv.",1397606400,2,1113,4.407766990291262
8304756,4,B001GBHSDO,"Great feature film but I hope you can read Spanish or good luck with controlling the DVD features on your DVD player, lol.  The quality of the product and the case is perfectly fine, it's just the Spanish language I had issue with since I don't speak the language.  I had to get my Hispanic neighbor to come over and show me how to operate the DVD at first, then all was well from that point on, lol.  Great flick, really!",1395446400,,422,4.185185185185185
