417840,4,6302032253,"After the very disappointing sequel to The Magnificent Seven, called Return of . . . , I kind of hoped they were going to end the series. With McQueen, Sturges, and the original screenwriters gone, the film just didn't work. The film was sadly filled with one western cliche after another and annoying platitudes. Then Guns of the Magnificent Seven comes out and I reluctantly go see it with a friend. I loved this film! Ten minutes into the movie and you stop worrying about how little George Kennedy resembles Yul Bryner. He fills the role of Chris as though he'd created him. Witness a great scene where Kennedy first meets Monte Markham's character, Keno, and in fact ends up saving him from being hanged as a horse thief using a humorously ingenious ploy.  Since both Keno and one of his pursuers claim to be the horse's owner, they must come up with a way to prove it one way or another.  Kennedy says drolly (pointing his cigar) ""let's ask the horse.""  What follows is quite humorous and serves to introduce Seven fans to the easy chemistry between Kennedy and Markham from the get-go.  Markham is one of those guys who was always good in films but never caught on like say, McQueen or Coburn, even though he bears a slight resemblance and demeanor to both. He even has that uncanny ability to deliver very short lines of dialog with either humor or poignancy.

Anyway, the script is quite good and each member of the Seven is richly drawn, albeit quickly, through striking visual introductions and terse, natural dialog.  You get an explosives expert, a one-armed Confederate sharp-shooter, a family man forced to join to support his family (the always excellent James Whitmore), a horse thief and presumed outlaw, a tuberculor gunfighter, an again one of the villagers who's ready to take up the fight.

The action sequences have all the muscle and athleticism that made the original so good. The fighters are not just shooting at each other--they're diving for cover, running and jumping across roofs, and almost always in motion--much the way Sturges filmed his actors.  The scenes where some of the Seven are killed are painful to watch, but filled with heroism.  And, of course, there's Elmer Bernstein's music, which practically lifts you out of your seat it's so exciting.  The script offers some nice quiet moments too, where the cowboys reminisce about the changing west.  One of the best written scenes is where Kennedy dismisses a potential ally with a bandit (poor man's Eli Wallach).  Reclining in the Seven's encampment, Kennedy doesn't even turn to face the mercenary and says something to the effect, ""I'll let you know if we need you.""

For true lovers of the Seven, this and the original are the only ones I'd recommend. Really good entertainment.",1186444800,6,2773,4.812631578947369
417841,2,6302032253,I love Westerns because I love the scenery and the music but Guns of the Magnificent Seven is really pushing my tolerance level. The acting is bad. Good actors. Nothing wrong with George Kennedy or James Whitmore. But the lines they were given and the direction was bad. Hang the writers and director. Go ahead and hang the producer too. The photography is good. Rent this movie but don't buy it.,1141948800,2,396,4.591549295774648
417842,4,6302032253,"This third film in the Magnificent Seven series is a very worthy sequel to the previous two movies.  The story involves a new group of seven who join together to free a Mexican revolutionary from a prison called the Cave of the Rats.  The movie is entertaining throughout as the group is organized and then their efforts in the prison break.  Many scenes show the influence of spaghetti westerns whether it be close-ups or camera angles during shoot-outs.  Either way, this is still a very good movie.
 George Kennedy replaces Yul Brynner as Chris, the leader of the Magnificent Seven.  Joining him are James Whitmore in a very good supporting role, Monte Markham as Keno(who seems to be a replacement for Steve McQueen's Vin), Reni Santoni, and Joe Don Baker as the one-armed gunman.  This movie tends to focus on the beliefs of the Seven as they prepare for battle and the friendships between them.  Also joining the cast is Frank Silvera, Fernando Rey, and Michael Ansara as the sinister Colonel Diego.  Kennedy is excellent as the new Chris with the other six also being worthwhile replacements.  Another star of the movie has to be Elmer Bernstein's rousing score that almost everyone around the world has heard.  This is an entertaining sequel that isn't as good as the first one, but probably more on the level of the second sequel.  VHS is of decent quality, but this one deserves to be on DVD.",1053216000,17,1402,4.724279835390947
417843,5,6302032253,"To some this was an inferior sequel to the original MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, but it is actually a splendid follow-up with a sensational cast, thus making the characters more believable, and in a way, giving them more of a personality.
The noted ""seven"" are as follows, and as stated from the advertising compaign from the original theatrical trailer, ""They Are Not Aiming to Please!"". George Kennedy replaces Yul Brynner as Chris Adams, making him a more pleasant character who is one to assist his comrades in need. One would almost expect a hard-headed character in the Lone Ranger tradition who is merely out for a bounty. Monte Markham is Keno, Chris' main partner of the piece and fleeing from the Law had it not been more Chris' help. James Whitmore is Levi Morgan, the knife-wielding family man. Bernie Casey is Cassie, dynamite expert and one unable to make decent profits through it. Joe Don Baker is Slater, almost literally refrained to the use of one arm and a Colt 45 weapon his trademark. Scott Thomas is P.J., rope and rifle his weapons of choice. Reni Santoni is Max, the young Mexican who heists[some] of Frank Silvera's dollars to help Chris in the manner.
Enter Michael Ansara as Colonel Diego. A truly sensational actor who made a niche for himself portraying Indians or evil mercenaries. Thus he makes Colonel Diego a nasty character who takes great enjoyment out of watching his slaves suffer torture. Whether it's being whipped until they beg to die, stuck with their heads in the sand while horses trample over them, or leaving them out to dry in the sunlight, he is thoroughly relishing it. He is the leader of the band of marauders, and all throughout makes the character intimidating, and at the same time, believable in the sense that he plays him with such conviction.
Film works more of an individual piece than a sequel is what makes it so unique and different. Thus the characters develop more of a trust and friendship, and they provide an excellent team when having a showdown with the villains of the piece. Elmer Bernstein's music score is excellent, and makes the action throughout even more exciting, and Paul Wendkos' direction is top notch. Great performances from all supporting characters as the cast is great.
I hope it's not long before the DVD is released as this has been out of print, and hard to obtain a copy of through video stores. If you're a Western fan, this is for you!",1044144000,12,2418,4.745843230403801
417844,3,6302032253,"In their third outing the 'Magnificent Seven' are gathered to free a mexican revolutionary from a well gaurded prison.  Goerge Kennedy takes on the role of Chris (Yul Brynner in the The Magnificent Seven' & 'Return  of the Seven' ) a role obviously given to him after his oscar win for 'Cool  Hand Luke' Kennedy is compitent in the lead role . although he's no match  for Yul Brynner, Kennedy and his 'Seven' James Whitmore, Bernie Casey, Jo  Don Baker, Monte Markham, Tony Davis & Reni Santoni embark on a rescue  mission to free revolution leader Fernando Rey( also in 'Return') from a  mexican general played by Micheal Ansara . a typically viscous and cruel  villian in the best tradition. much better a movie than the dark 'Return of  the Seven' this film follows more along the guiedlines of the original 7  with good character developement and exiciting action sequences.  The Third  ride for the 7 is definetley worth a look.",963532800,3,933,4.726708074534161
417905,3,6302032253,"It's hard to improve upon greatness. Just ask John Sturges, who was given the task of trying to literally Westernize the Kurosawa classic THE SEVEN SAMURAI. The result was THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. To some, including me, the original samurai epic is superior, for as the master himself said, ""Gunmen are not samurai."" This, of course, speaks more to the historical misreading of American cowboys being basically the same as samurai. Instead, samurai were a vast political and military ruling Japanese class; whereas ""cowboys"" generally were not. But to others, the cribbed ""cowboy"" classic THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is superior. It has, admittedly, become a touchstone movie that inspired similar Western efforts (like ""Rio Conchos"") and even a sci-fi treatment (as ""Battle Beyond the Stars""). So what is to be gained with a bunch of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN direct sequels? Money, of course.

Missing from this Seven sequel is Yul Brenner's black clad mix of intensity and mystique. However, George Kennedy's more homespun take on Yul's ""Chris"" (complete with a cigar-chomping, almost Steve McQueenish infusion of frontier wit) still retains the character's talent for  recruiting some of the West's best for seemingly insurmountable missions of mercy. And this time, it's springing a popular Mexican revolutionary from ""The Cave of the Rats"": A well-guarded prison. Luckily, Kennedy's Chris offers a bit more than Yul's mere $20 signing bonus: This time, it's $100 a man. One mercenary salivates over the prospect: ""A hundred dollars! I never seen that kind of money before.""

Speaking of mercenaries, Guns diversifies them: By adding black, handicapped, elderly, and diseased soldiers-of-fortune to the team. While this makes the dynamics a bit more interesting than just admiring the original group's shooting skills or costumes, it unfortunately internalizes much of the plot. There's more bickering amongst the Seven (particularly between Bernie Casey's ""Cassie"" and Joe Don Baker's ex-Confederate ""Slater""). Also, there is no youthful gunlust, as the Horst Buchholz characterization through ""Chico"" is replaced. As for romance, it is forced. However, in another nice bit of casting originality, the tuburcular mercenary ""gets the girl,"" rather than one of the studly main stars. But totally absent is any heart-felt bonding between this set of Seven and the displaced peasants they help.

Guns's other strength is considerably amping up the action. The Seven train a much more effective and willing peasant guerilla force to combat what are now Mexican Federales, rather than bandits. Judo, dynamite, and Gatling guns are a few new additions to their arsenal, although Chris does use the offensive strategy of the original. Unfortunately, their new enemy (Michael Ansara's brutal Colonel Diego) can't top legendary Calvera's philosophical brand of tyranny. As for the bandit king? An approximation of his band and he are present, but are given different roles that clutter the plot.

Guns of the Magnificent Seven excels at diversity of action and casting. But, its philosophical theme of forging cooperation and respect between a vastly different set of gunslingers isn't as compelling as the original's unusual [for the time] exploration of  ""the dying West"" and deriving satisfaction from family and community.

In the end, Guns is the best of the sequels, but can't outgun its parent pic.",1488240000,,3389,5.395085066162571

One of the things I dislike about too many movies is dumb action sequences and this has one of the dumbess. Like the seven are besieged by bandit and more than a hundred more are on the way... So what do the writers and producer have them do?  Yep, sneak out somehow with their horses, ride up a hill behind them and then come charging down on the 75 or so bandits who are hiding behind rocks and walls!  Six guns on horse back against ten times their number, behind barriers with a lot of rifles. AND, they kill a dozen or so without a single injury, except the loss of one horse.

Then, in the blink of an eye, the hundred-plus bandit reinforcements arrive, thundering over the same hill. Now it's the seven on foot who, sort of firing fro around a the village fountain, cut down dozens of charging bandits.

Like the previous versions, one by one, four of the seven die heroically; but they get the bandit leader. And, like the previous movies, one stays behind to live the peacefully life while the two ride off so their surviving characters can do another sequal.",1458000000,2,1265,4.412017167381975

418510,4,6302032253,"Perception is everything, sometimes. Suppose you were one of the five action movie fans in North America who've never seen the original ""Magnificent Seven"". How would this third M7 installment come across if you saw it first?

I'm guessing pretty well. The problem for most of us, though, is that while we watch this a part of our brain is busy comparing it to the 1960 classic. That's both a tough act to follow, and distracting from the presentation at hand. Which, for its part, flips the original idea of a handful of warriors digging in to defend a bandit-plagued village, sending instead another elite crew on the offensive to spring a charismatic local leader from a formidable Mexican prison. It takes a while to concentrate on the proceedings here, and rerunning the great Elmer Bernstein theme music only makes it harder.

Once you do settle in with the remake, however, you realize that it stands very nicely on its own merits. Leader George Kennedy is highly effective as the tough, sharp, compassionate leader of the imports. He knows when to speak up, what to say and what not. Onetime NFL star Bernie Casey is surprisingly good as one of the cobbled-together crew, a young Joe Don Baker the same. Michael Ansara as the prison commandant baddie orchestrates a couple of very nasty scenes that presage the graphically violent Hollywood treatment many remember as dating from Sam Peckinpah's subsequent ""The Wild Bunch"". Photography and script here are solid, the closing 'a coward dies many deaths, a hero only one' line dating from Shakespeare never failing to grab me.

It may take a couple of viewings to work past the aura of the original Mag Seven film with this one, but if it does I think you'll ultimately find it worth the trouble.",1419465600,,1753,4.798013245033113

418515,3,6302032253,"When Yul Brynner turned down the chance to star in this Western, they turned to... George Kennedy? As Chris, the Cajun leader of the ""Seven"", Brynner was so lean, alert, and full of coiled energy that you believed he was as wary and dangerous as a rattlesnake. Kennedy has about as much energy as your grandpa after a big Thanksgiving dinner. He eschews Brynner's trademark black outfit for non-descript cowpoke clothes more suitable to his lumpy frame, and always seems to have risen to action from a comfortable sofa. With the exception of James Whitmore, the rest of the Seven are equally uninteresting.

However, the film is well directed, for what it is, and well-photographed on Spanish locations. And it has Elmer Bernstein re-working his memorable music, weaving the familiar themes together in interesting ways.

418581,3,6302032253,"I reviewed the original Magnificent Seven earlier. That one was made in 1960, and included some truly magnificent actors, among them Yul Brenner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and James Coburn.

In comparison, I think we should call this one ""The Adequate Seven."" George Kennedy is the leader of this seven, and none of the rest are really stars, although James Whitmore does a good job as the senior member of the band. It's not a bad movie by any means, but rather too much of a replay of the first one without the stars.

Mexican peasants hire Chris (Kennedy) to be their hired gun to spring their leader from a terrible prison/fort where they are outnumbered something like 40 to one. They recruit a handful of young peasants, but they are not experienced fighters. They have a clever plan, so they succeed, although four of the seven die in the effort.

It's a sort of bilingual shoot-em-up not unlike the sort of thing we saw every week in Zorro when we were kids. Without the stars, it's merely an adequate movie.",1336953600,2,1036,4.6502732240437155
418582,4,6302032253,"This fine western spins a tale of a band of mercenaries who come to the aid of Mexican villagers who live in fear under the rule of an oppressive military led by a cruel general. The rebels are desperate to rescue their imprisoned leader and turn to a hired gunman with a reputation. The film is very much like the original movie in plot but with a different cast and an appealing hero, played by George Kennedy. The six men are recruited and fashioned into a crack fighting unit that gets help in the nick of time from an outlaw band of patriots who are also under the thumb of the despotic military ruler, in a good turn by Michael Ansara. James Whitmore, Fernando Rey, Paul Casey and Joe Don Baker are the other well-known names in this enjoyable western.",1275177600,3,758,4.421428571428572
418583,3,6302032253,"Although it's neither as classic as John Sturges' ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960) nor as striking as Burt Kennedy's ""Return of the Seven"" (1966), director Paul Wendkos' ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"" qualifies as a solidly-made, beautifully-lensed horse opera that takes our heroes south of the border again.  However, this time the seven are fighting with the peasants in a greater cause to topple a draconian political regime. ""Cool Hand Luke"" Oscar winner George Kennedy steps into Yul Brynner's boots as Chris who heads-up the septet in all four theatrical features. Mind you, Kennedy's a fine dramatic actor, but he looks miscast. He looks like he had a tough time getting around on-screen. His dialogue deliveries are letter-perfect and he looks rugged enough, but he lacks the charisma of a Saturday Matine hero. He fared a lot better as the villain in ""The Sons of Katie Elder."" Meanwhile, this ""Seven"" differs in several respects from the first two. First, the end of the frontier and the decline of the gunfighter as a theme is never mentioned in Wendkos' ""Seven."" In ""The Magnificent Seven,"" Chris tells Vin that they lost and the farmers won, while in ""Return of the Seven,"" Chris refers to himself as 'damned.' Second, the heroes don't take time out to bitch about the tragic life of a gunfighter. They don't dissuade young Max from leading his people into the hills to continue the revolutionary struggle. Third, George Kennedy's Chris isn't as dark or as remorseful as Yul Brynner's Chris. Fourth, the inventive Herman Hoffman screenplay emphasizes elements usually found in the Spaghetti westerns of the day. This time around Chris and company dynamite a Mexican political prison and liberate a crusading leader of the revolution. Neither the peasants nor the bandits in the hills could have achieved this feat without the seven. Fifth, the ethnic composition of Wendkos' ""Seven"" has grown more complicated. Bernie Casey as Cassie emerges as the first African-American to appear in a ""Seven"" western, and the broad hint is that James Whitmore's Levi Morgan is Jewish. Sixth, a handicapped character joins the seven; Joe Don Baker plays Slater, an ex-Confederate soldier with a useless left arm, a character rarely seen in westerns but quite popular in martial arts epics, like Chen Chang's ""One Armed Swordsman"" (1967). Seven, though they are paid a hefty $100 for their services--they are the highest paid ""Seven"" in history, none of them collects a dime. George Kennedy and James Whitmore ride off without a word about their money. Eighth, the Mexican bandits that the seven fought in the first two films are now on their side and serve as the cavalry function. Ninth, this is the first ""Seven"" movie to employ a Gatling gun as a part of the villain's arsenal.

Chris gathers one of the least memorable line-up of characters in ""Guns."" Keno with his ""No questions"" motto is straight out of prison. Interestingly enough, he dresses a lot like the Steve McQueen character in ""The Magnificent Seven."" Cassie has been fired from a mining company where he used dynamite blast holes in the mountain so that the miners could dig ore. Slater puts on a marksman's act at a carnival and calls himself ""half-man, half-gun."" Levi has already settled down with a wife and a family but needs a new well. P.J., the most enigmatic of the crew, is a consumptive who dresses in black like Yul Brynner's Chris. Finally, Max is a mealy-mouthed Mexican twenthysomething who doesn't know the first thing about fighting but is willing to learn. There are no moral degenerates like Warren Oates' Colbee or suicidal maniacs Claude Atkins's Frank in ""Return of the Seven."" Unfortunately, the death scenes for the four ill-fated gunfighters aren't as memorable as those in the first two ""Seven"" movies. Slater appears to throw his life away and Cassie dies without getting his gun out of his holster. P.J.'s death scene is no great shakes either. Only Monte Markham's Keno achieves some dramatic statue in his demise.

Chris' first scene in town where the people are going to hang Keno (Monte Markham of ""Hour of the Gun"") for stealing a man's horse is a visual delight and a dramatic triumph. Wendkos uses clever camera set-ups to anticipate which person that the horse will inevitably respond to. The introduction even before that scene of the evil prison warden, Colonel Diego (played with slimy urbanity by veteran heavy Michael Ansara) is powerful. A prisoner is dragged into the warden's presence and deposited at his booted feet. We don't see Ansara at first; all we see is his ominous shadow hovering over the prisoner. The off-kilter camera angles in the shoot-out between Slater and the loud-mouthed cowboy enhance the dramatic tension of the showdown. Wendkos stages each of the gun battles with verve. The scene where Whitmore hits the tower guard with a knife in the back and the peasant that he has trained hits the same guard in the chest is good, too. The explosion that destroys the gates of the Rat Hole is composed so that we see the violence of it sweep across the screen from left to right is visually invigorating. The showdown between Chris and Colonel Diego compares favorably with the Yul Brynner & Eli Wallach showdown in ""The Magnificent Seven."" The chief difference is that whereas the Wallach villain couldn't understand why a man like Chris came back to such a lowly village, Colonel Diego believes that Chris is an indifferent mercenary who has no passion for the revolution and will allow Diego to live. The outcome of the Chris & Diego showdown, however, was sealed during the human rights violation scene where Diego let his soldiers gallop their horses around the prison yard where the tongue-tied inmates had been buried up to their chins in the ground.

""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"" is a good western, not as good as the first two ""Seven"" movies, but definitely better than ""The Magnificent Seven Ride!""

It would be great if MGM-UA put a commentary track on this movie to enhance its quality.  Otherwise, there is nothing really impressive.",1225497600,3,6072,4.936399217221135
418584,4,6302032253,"This 1969 release is the second and, by far, the best of the three sequels to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1960).  Filmed in Spain, it has a good script by Herman Hoffman and director Paul Wendkos does not stint on the action.

George Kennedy plays the role of ""Chris,"" originated by Yul Brynner.  In this new adventure, he gathers together six new gunfighters to cross back into Mexico in order to free a revolutionary leader (Fernando Rey) from an Army prison run by a cruel, brutal colonel (Michael Ansara).

Among Chris' new companions are James Whitmore, Monte Markham, Bernie Casey, Joe Don Baker, Scott Thomas and Reni Santoni.

An entertaining western.
