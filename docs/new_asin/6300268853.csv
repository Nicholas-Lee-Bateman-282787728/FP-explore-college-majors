283295,5,6300268853,"Lucy was 62 years old when she did this film and she never looked better!  So what if some of the shots of her are ""blurred."" If you look at any of the film noirs from the 30's and 40's, a lot, and I mean a lot of the actresses where photographed that way!!!!!!!
Lucy's costumes were stunning not to mention the set for 3 Beekman Place!
The film is brilliant!!!!! PERIOD!!",925430400,,372,4.166666666666667
283296,5,6300268853,"Most fans of Auntie Mame have a hard time with the musical version, especially in comparing Roz Russell to Lucille Ball...but as a Classy yet wacky New York sophisticate, no one can argue with Lucy's portrayal.  Mame  is a delightful character who always lands on her feet and never loses her  class or elegance.  Robert Preston is perfect and gorgeous as Beauregard,  and the photography is lush and breathtaking. Heck, Vera Wang's costumes  alone are worth a look! The high-energy, wonderfully choreographed dance  numbers, the touching score, and the humor of the play, which remains  intact, make this a very enjoyable treat.  Weak links are the older  Patrick, and Gooch, who could have been better cast...but that's splitting  hairs.  Try it - you might really be pleasantly surprised!",919382400,,791,5.09375

283368,5,6300268853,"Very funny musical rewrite of the original Auntie Mame. Lucille Ball was a funny and agile as always. quite a journey through a different time in history. Auntie Mame is my favorite movie of all time, so this was very reminiscent.",1517961600,,230,4.634146341463414

283372,1,6300268853,Below avg rating because I love this story but didn't realize this story had remakes.  I thought there was only one version - the original was heart wrenching and the characters were believable.  So I bought this one by mistake not realizing it was a remake of the one I love and adore.  The acting in this version is poor.  Really poor and lacks emotional connection with the audience.  Upside is I found the original after suffering this one- and bought it.,1513987200,,459,4.548780487804878

283374,1,6300268853,"Lucy, too old for the part in soft focus, sad. Angela Lansbury in the play was great and could ""harmonize"" with Bea Arthur unlike Lucy. Shame they didn't realize Mame was name enough for the movie and they didn't need Lucy or her money to put it over. If you get a chance there is a bootleg copy of the play, even in poor quality it's better than the movie. Biggest Broadway-Movie shame since they didn't give Eliza Doolittle to Julie Andrews.",1509235200,,443,4.414634146341464

283408,1,6300268853,"I thought this was one of the worst movies I ever started to watch. We had just watched the original movie with Rosalind Russell, and I had read the book, both of which were delightful. I was interested to see this version. The music, besides the two famous songs, was awful, and the singing worse. Bea Arthur played a mean Vera Charles, and they took precious story time for unimportant scenes like Mame messing up her tiny part in Vera's play. It wasn't funny like the original, because there was no time for that with the music. We turned it off after 30 minutes because it just didn't get any better.

Unless you are a die-hard Lucy fan, which I'm not, then I wouldn't bother with this one.",1497052800,,694,4.421875
283409,1,6300268853,I just did not like this production of Mame.  It was slow and boring.,1496707200,,69,3.9285714285714284
283410,5,6300268853,Lucille Ball is stunning.  One could only wish for an Aunt as magical as her.  It was great to see her looking beautiful and not playing the fool with Desi Arnez.  I enjoyed the singing and dancing in this movie immensely.  The story of Mame is unique and the supporting actors were also very good.,1496620800,2,298,4.363636363636363
283411,4,6300268853,"I was one of those snobs who sneered when Lucy played Mame. Finally I decided that the music was just too wonderful, and Lucy was her delightful self in the role. It's better if you don't compare it with the earlier Auntie Mame which has more of the story but none of the delightful songs. Bea Arthur is the perfect Vera Charles. The ""Bosom Buddies"" scene is hilarious.",1495065600,3,369,4.4411764705882355
283412,1,6300268853,"I love Lucy too!  But she should not have done this movie.  It was a big bomb when it opened. Lucy can't sing or dance and every time she is on screen the cinematographer used multiple pairs of pantyhose as a filter.  Angela Lansbury should have starred in this movie.  She originated the role on Broadway and it was the triumph of her career.
Bea Arthur was amazing.
If you want to see a truly funny version of Mame go to the filmed version of the play, Auntie Mame starring Roselind Russell.",1494720000,,493,4.326086956521739

283538,5,6300268853,"I love Lucy.  I always have.  She was special and one of a kind.  I don't care that this musical didn't do well with critics.  I love it because it has Lucille Ball, a legendary performer, in it.  She makes MAME worth watching with her wit and beauty and comedic timing and charm.  She wears the most beautiful costumes in this movie and the scenery is breathtaking.  It's a touching, fun story, too.  It's a comedy musical and I watch it all the time because it makes me smile and feel warm and happy inside, which not too many movies make me feel these days.  I miss the days when you could see a movie without cursing in it and a movie with heart and warmth and lots of laughs.  This is a very special movie and watching Bea Arthur and Lucille Ball together is a real hoot.  They make a great pair in this movie.  Robert Preston is such a sexy, handsome man whom I love watching in Victor/Victoria.  He adds a special something to the film as do the other actors/actresses.  It's just a fun, enjoyable film to watch.",1477785600,6,1019,4.267015706806283
283539,4,6300268853,"This is super cheesy but fun, and Lucille Ball is perfect, in my opinion. I love that Auntie Mame is played by an older woman - which makes sense as Patricks aunt. Ball is funny and grand but she also comes across as warm. You can see how she loves the boy. I've watched snippets from teh Landsbury Broadway production of youtube, and I really didn't think it was better. The cheesy part - well, the whole story especially the second half when Patrick is older. But there are some great songs and the clothes are fabulous.",1477699200,2,522,4.391752577319588

283541,5,6300268853,"This is excellent!  Contrary to reviews at the time, Lucile Ball's performance and interpretation of Auntie Mame was wonderful!  Many people say that Angela Lansbury's Broadway performance was better.  I disagree.  Lansbury's Mame was stiff and not nearly as sophisticated and believable as Lucile Ball's performance.  Lucile Ball's Mame is someone who you wish you knew or were even related too.  Also, the costumes and the set design were excellent and memorable.
In all, Lucy's elegant Mame is immortalized in this production and is the one that will be loved and enjoyed by future generations along with Rosalind Russell's earlier non-musical version.",1477612800,,655,5.372549019607843

What I did was put the cast album on the turntable and drop the needle when Lucy was supposed to sing.  Lucy's acting was not too horrible, but that voice that voice",1475280000,,334,4.338709677419355

The acting/singing, and story line just keep one continually on their toes and what a wonderful way to spend a casual afternoon or evening.  Lucile Ball just brings all her many sides to the forefront highlighting her multi-talent's.  You will catch yourself laughing one minute, and the next be astounded by a loving elegant lady.  The music far exceeds one's expectation, but the numbers just draw the whole story line together.  I find myself singing the title song over and over for what other way can one lift up their spirits than to just want to be there singing along with them.  The producer has accomplished one of the masterpiece classical musicals of all time that needs to be seen by all those that love a good clean story line that can inspire even those non musical lovers out there.  In the words of a non musical person ""Be Happy"".  Life is to short to have missed one of the most beloved musical productions of this century.

Quite frankly I'm confused by all of the really negative reviews about Lucille Ball having an ""awful scratchy singing voice"" and how she's not Rosiland R.  So what?  This by all counts is a fun and endearing old time feel good movie.  The Bosom Buddies scene is practically worth the movie itself, and Bea Authur is so campy and yet classy - she's a joy to watch.  Lucille also did a nice job for this role, IMO for what she was able to do because she and Vera made the movie fun.  I feel like some of the armchair critics were busy making big signs displaying ""0"" score while the movie was playing, and then probably went to the extra step of holding up the signs up to their TV's either during the movie or during the credits.

283709,2,6300268853,"I loved the straight play ""Auntie Mame"", a family favorite for decades.  I loved the musical ""Mame"" and the additions of the songs and Broadway production numbers. I loved Rosalind Russell as the one and only Mame of the filmed play, loved Angela Lansbury as the first of many fascinating broadway musical Mames, and have literally loved Lucy all my life in a host of other things.

How can something with so much love attached have ended up such a dreadful film?

I give one star for sets, one for magnificent costumes that unfortunately overstage everything and everyone else in the film.  But cosmetic supports aside, serious demerits must be taken for pacing and the leaden production, tonal shifts that drain any possibility of fun, and, most
sadly of all, the truly unhappy performance of Lucy.

I have great sympathy for aging stars, greats or not-so-greats, who cannot resist one more leap into the limelight.  I watch with the greatest support and understanding when my favorites push just once too many times into a role it might have been best to leave to another, but never have I been so unable to endorse any part of a performance of a part that should most definitely have been graciously refused.  The ""might have been"" ruminations of fans would have been far superior to the fact of this permanent record.

Perhaps if the scintillating Russell Mame were not captured on film as well, perhaps Lucy might have fared better but I don't believe so.  Perhaps if Lansbury and numerous other aging actresses that brought vitality and charm to the musical version from Broadway to every city in the country were not legendary and remembered fondly, each with a fervent following, perhaps the film would not seem so lifeless but I doubt it.  The dead center of ""Mame"" is not due to any other performance or production.  It is intrinsic to this film.  From start to finish it is a thundering disappointment.

Watch ""Auntie Mame"" or find a revival of the musical, playing somewhere even today, I'm sure.  There you will find energy, charm and great
theatrical fun.  Watch Lucy in something else - she has many great things to show.  I just don't think she will be found at her best in this film.",1453593600,,2201,4.722513089005235

283841,4,6300268853,"A lush and glamorous film adaptation of the Broadway hit. If you lie the show, you'll probably like the film. Alas, Lucille Ball was a terrific comedian, but not really a singer. How I wish they'd cast Angela Lansbury, the Broadway Mame, in the film lead!  I still love the songs, and the costumes and sets are fantastic. There are changes in scenes and music from the stage musical - I'm currently rehearsing for a production so I know - but this is par for the course for musicals on film.",1437523200,,491,4.395604395604396

283843,5,6300268853,"MAME is an outstanding musical directed by Gene Saks. Lucille Ball is Mame in her last film performance seems to have grown into this role over the years. The critics were not kine to her at the time. Forty years later, MAME looks like one of the last great musicals that it should have been considered. The film seems more timely now. and I enjoy seeing Bea Arthur, Bruce Davison and especially Robert Preston in the cast. The Production Design by Robert F. Boyle is impressive as is the cinematography by Philip H. Lathrop. MAME has stood the test of time and rebounded.",1437091200,2,572,4.563106796116505

283887,4,6300268853,"People have panned this movie because Lucille Ball wasn't the best singer -- still I think this movie is a gem!  Lucy is less grande dame than Rosalind Russell in Auntie Mame, and plays the character with a little more bite and snarky wit. Bea Arthur plays Vera with a dry, dead-pan sense of a humor that is also terrific.  Robert Preston plays Beau, and when he sings ""Loving You"" to Mame (a song that I believe was written for the movie version) it's really quite romantic and beautful.  I really enjoy this movie!",1435968000,3,516,4.468085106382978

283893,5,6300268853,"I know that to some Rosalind Russell, and Angela Lansbury gave the quintessential performances of the character Mame Dennis. But as wonderful as those gifted actresses are, for me, my heart belongs to Lucille Ball. And even though critics panned her performance stating she was, ""Not up to the musical demands of the role"" I disagree; because I look @ her entire performance; she brings such class to the screen, and absolutely no one could play comedy as she did, she was larger than life. I remember being 16; and going to the Cinema when it was initially released; she filled the screen w/ such presence. Bea Arthur and Jane Connell both reprise their Broadway roles to perfection as Mame's best friend Vera Charles and Patrick's Nanny, Agnes Gooch. And the costumes are simply beautiful; especially the Riding ensembles during the title song. The closing scene gets me every time when Patrick; now grown w/ a boy of his own, hands him over to Auntie Mame for a trip to Siberia and says, ""She hasn't changed; she's ""The Pied Piper."" I can't imagine any one other than Lucy waving from the steps of that plane. For those fans of hers who haven't seen this gem I highly recommend that you give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",1433376000,2,1231,4.651376146788991

But Lucille Ball bought it, and that was that. And she is in the wrong movie. The role doesn't require a great singer, but it needs someone who can deliver a song. And she can't. Bea Arthur is fun as Vera, and Robert Preston is as good as he always is. But Jane Connell's Gooch should have stayed on the stage. They should have gone with the first choice, Madeline Kahn. They started filming with her but Lucille Ball saw the rushes, and knew she was going to steal the film. Exit Madeline. The choreography is dull too, as it was on the stage.
  Buy Auntie Mame instead, and then buy Eyde Gorme's CD, 'Don't Go To Strangers'. She does the best version of 'If He Walked Into My Life' on that disc.",1408320000,4,876,4.303030303030303

284349,5,6300268853,"Mame Entertains!  That is the bottom line.

Three points:

* Lucille Ball - well Lucy was clearly at the end of her long and brilliant career.  She was in her 60s when she did Mame and at times she shows it, but she dances, sings, and generally is very good.  Bea Arthur was no spring chicken either yet no one carps about her.  So put it to rest.

Yes Lucy wasn't Rosalind Russell or Angela Lansbury.  But Roslind Russell wasn't Ethel Merman in Gypsy, nor was Audrey Hepburn  Julie Andrews in My Fair Lady, and Julie Andrews wasn't  Mary Martin in the Sound of Music.  The list could go on and on.

 She was Lucille Ball giving her interpretation of Mame Dennis and it worked.

* The movie Mame  was old fashioned.

Mame had a lot going against it in 1974,  and the primary thing that most people lose sight of was the movie version of Cabaret, which had just been made and released to great acclaim.

Cabaret was clearly a sea change in movie musicals, and it was a hard act to follow not just for Mame but for any musical that would have been made in the 1970s.

That said, Mame  doesn't seem to drag or be un-watchable as is Dr Doolittle or others made in the late 1960s, which adhered to the ""more is more"" approach to movie making.  It doesn't beat you to death with too many musical  numbers as does terribly misconceived "" Wiz"" later in the decade.  It doesn't suffer from a general misunderstanding of how long an audience can endure endless ""entertainment.""

So what if it was ""old fashioned,"" the stars were all excellent. The film was beautifully made.  The score is one of the best in musicals - with the songs adding to the plot development and moving the story along.  And it is entertainment pure and simple.

*Finally those who carp about Mame, should give it a break.  Its been nearly 40 years and given the films routinely turned out in Hollywood now, Mame comes across as Shakespeare.

It was and remains a good piece of family entertainment, funny, a bit risque for the times - yes Agnes Gooch, the great Jane Connell, who died in September 2013, was in the ""family way,"" something that shocked my grandmother in 1958, but is tame today, and you don't have to worry about the ""F"" bomb being dropped every other word.

So ""Have a little Christmas"" and watch Mame with your children, you will be glad that you did.",1384560000,3,2333,4.408450704225352

I would have preferred to have had Angela Lansbury transfer her stage role to that in the film. However, Robert Preston and Bea Arthur go a long way to bring life into the film. Lucille Ball had this bad habit of handing a scene to another as long as it didn't detract from her (Lucy) image. Like waiting for the other to speak their lines.

284541,5,6300268853,"Lucille Ball takes on the musical role of Auntie Mame Denis that Rosalind Russell made famous as a drama. With her side kick, Bea Arthur playing best friend Vera, delivery of terrific, moving and lively hilarious performances delight. By this time in Miss Ball's life, she sings quite deep compared to her early soprano torch singing voice. Combined numbers with Miss Arthur, including both songs and dance moves are show stoppers because of who the two oh so famous comical women are performing them. Rather than their routines being technically musically or dance routine perfection. Add Robert Preston to this mix, as Mame's wealthy Southern husband, spices up this musical's quality. Even moreso, writing as a former dancer in stage musicals, is the most amazing chorus imaginable. This chorus performs the title song ""Mame"" with such energy and vocal skills, they seem to be peforming a well deserved salute to Lucille Ball herself, not just the character she's playing. It's long musical number with dancing that's a big production. Miss Ball stands alone as the entire ensemble performs for her. It raised the hair on my arms, gave me chills with tears streaming down my cheeks because of all the entertainers of the 20th century, Lucy has to be counted among the very best, and yet, instead of being awarded for countless hours of bringing uproarous laughter into our lives, Miss Ball was accused of being a communist during the Republican House Unamerican Activities Committee (UAC) witch hunt. I had a sense of justice being done for Miss Ball because of how she was featured so well in this well acted film. During quite a few scenes Miss Ball proves how her delivery of lines could put bigotry, superiority, opulance and other various sorts of supremacism on the spot. In fact, I feel she acts our her disgust better than Miss Russell. But that why we 'loved Lucy."" She really could master all of the performance art forms she tried on.

She's an icon, a legend and truly the most loved performer of the 20th century!
How dare someone review this spectacular movie with derogatory remarks such as her age and vocals.
Let's get one thing straight - it takes balls to subject oneself to the action and romping around
her character persevered and, although at age 62, she accomplished all of this marvelously!
So what if her vocals left something to be desired?  The character ""Mame"" was not a singer and Lucy should have been praised, not ridiculed, for not allowing a ""singer"" to perform any of the vocals. This production was delayed nearly a year while she recovered from a broken leg suffered from a skiing accident.  More power and dedication to her!!!
Her wardrobe...WOW!!!  She had never looked so beautiful and elegant.  Her contract stipulated she
was to keep all the fashion she wore in the film, although she was never seen in public wearing it,
except at the premier of the movie in Hollywood at the Cinerama Dome theater.  I was there!!!
Lucy lives forever in our hearts and there was never anyone before her and will never be anyone after her that could fill those incredible shoes!

284621,1,6300268853,"Lucille Ball stars as Mame, an eccentric, avant-garde New Yorker who suddenly becomes the guardian of her orphaned nephew.  She opens new vistas for the boy but when the Depression hits, she finds herself a shop clerk.  Luckily, one of her first customers is a handsome, wealthy, and single Southern gentleman (Robert Preston).

First of all, this is the Worst Movie Ever; not funny bad, but miserably awful in every way.  When the story opens, Mame is about 42, but Lucy's 62, looks 72, and sounds 82.  Her voice is so low and gravelly, she sounds like Foghorn Leghorn and is about as subtle.  When she smiles, she has a frozen leer on her face that makes her look like a mummy, even with the ridiculous soft-focus lens that fools no one.  From her first scene, she has no warmth or heart, nothing about her that would make a little boy love her, let alone her hoards of minions.

Bea Arthur plays Mame's best friend, but she's made up to look like an ugly man.  She and Lucy have no chemistry at all and their witty repartee falls flat.

The story moves way too quickly in order to fit in all the songs which are slow and dreary; they could have been saved if Lucy would sing, but she can't.  Mame's wardrobe is stylish and striking, but Lucy seems to be posing like a wax figure in them, rather than actually being a fabulously charismatic woman.  Watching this movie just makes one remember how much better Rosalind Russell was in the original, non-musical version.",1339027200,6,1469,4.5227272727272725

The gravel and frog in her voice when she sings are worse than finger nails on a chalk board and she conveys none of the charm or warmth of the role.

Live on stage with a talented production is the best way to see Mame and Rosalind Russell is the only movie version that comes close to capturing the humor, warmth and spirit that is Auntie Mame.

Save your ears and eyes, avoid the Lucille Ball version Mame.

Mark Twain once said, ""reality is stranger than fiction, because fiction has to make sence"".  The 1958 film does this, the later remake doesen't-- the writeing is tipical of the 70's; fragmented, sensored, and trying to make a non statement about anything.

As much as I love 'Lucy', in this film she, the writers, producers, ect., didn't make a movie that 'tied together'--it had none of the whit, sarcasim, humor, and social commentary that the 1958 film had, and I feel sorry; Rosanand Russel is 'Mame', 'Lucy' is not.

284646,2,6300268853,"Sadly, the Rosalind Russell version of Mame is so indelibly set in my mind that watching anyone else take a stab at that beloved character is almost unbearable to watch.  Of course, had they done a decent job at it, my reaction might be a bit different, if not forgiving.  I've also got the Angela Lansbury soundtrack, and knowing how well she performed anywhere, anytime, at anything, I know she would have been the best (better) choice to play a character she originated on Broadway.  Unfortunately, Warner Bros thought differently and what we got stuck with is the Lucy version.  That Lucy can't/couldn't sing is legendary, so why anyone thought she would be the best choice in a musical of that caliber is anyone's guess.  Needless to say, as this movie opens on a BIG production number featuring Lucy's rusty growl of a voice, all monotone, I couldn't help but cringe and groan.  At any point during the production everyone involved had to have seen how inadequate Lucy was, why they decided to go forward with this doomed project is a mystery; the results speak for themselves.  This is, as Bea Arthur famously put it, ""a disaster.""
Oh a happy note, Jane Connell as Agnes Gooch is a marvel, Beatrice Arthur as the famous Vera Charles is incredible, and Robert Preston is always a joy to watch.  Wish they had bigger parts.  Wish they hadn't cast Bruce Davison as the older Patrick.  But wishes, at this point, gets us nowhere, this is the only film version of the musical and we're stuck with it until someone does the job right.  Don't think that will ever happen as long as Jerry Herman can still say no way.  In that case, I'd rather do without than ever watch this dud again.

I've never seen it on DVD, and maybe if they could have dubbed the vocals of Lucille Ball it might have been better. I was very disappointed in them using Lucille Ball in the role of Mame.  This was a musical, and Lucy can't sing. She has an terrible voice.  She ruined every song she tried to sing.  Really awful. Bea Arthur helped the film, but Lucy ruined it.  Actually, I first saw I Love Lucy when I was about 14 and we got a TV. The show ran for years, but I only thought it was funny when I was a kid. But as I grew up, I wasn't interested in it anymore. Better comedy came along.  Especially in the 70's.

Having seen Mame in theater with Angela Lansbury, this Mame horrified me.  I would have liked it better if they had at least dubbed Ball's voice or even 100% better if they used Angela Lansbury herself in the title role, but since they didn't, I was very disappointed.

284681,2,6300268853,"I am sorry to say I fall on the side of the dissenters here - ""Mame"" is a flop of mammoth proportions. Lucille Ball prances and croaks her way through the role of the big hearted eccentric Mame, who's softer side shows itself when an orphaned nephew comes to stay. The story is slight and it's punctuated with a seemingly endless parade of dreadful musical numbers...right from the very opening when the credits are accompanied by a terrible warbled ditty about arriving in Manhatten (sung by Jane Connell), it's clear that things are not going to be good. Lucille Ball is no singer either, but she keeps trying all the way through, until you are so beaten over the head with bad music it all starts to wash over you.

There are a few gems of fun in the otherwise painful 2 hours - first of all Bea Arthur as Vera Charles steals every scene she is in: ""Someone's been sleeping in my dress..."" And Lucille Ball still had some of her magic - out of the entire 2 hours plus running time I had just one real laugh watching her face as she politely choked down a nasty tasting snack at the home of her potential in-laws - it reminded me how she used to be such a star of physical comedy.

Apart from this though, there is very little to enjoy here. The first half of the film demands that you feel the family love between Mame and her 9 year old ward, but this is sadly impossible due to the wretched performance turned in by the actor playing the young child, and to make matters worse he gets a solo in a song that seemingly has no tune (""My Best Girl""), which I actually had to cover my ears for!  The only song that's any fun at all is ""Bosom Buddies"", but again that's largely due to Bea Arthur again. All the songs that Lucille Ball sings are ruined, especially near the end where she sings the song off screen (""If He Walked Into My Life"") at the same time as we watch her wandering about her empty house trying to look pained in the film's supposed emotional highlight...it just doesn't work at all.

284705,3,6300268853,"I saw this film when it was originally released, and remember the backlash that ensued.  Lucy's reviews were generally horrendous, and possibly deserved since she had strong armed herself into the production.  She was Lucy and she had a lot of clout in Hollywood -- this was before the final faseout.  Thus poor Angela Lansbury, the original musical Mame, never really had a chance at duplicating her legendary performance on film. I remember reading newspaper interviews and articles in which a tearful Lucy railed against the backlash and claimed that it was unfair because 'America needed wholsome entertainment.' Nonetheless, the film continued to bomb and the reviews merciless.  As an aside, originally Madeline Kahn, more age-appropriate, was hired to play Agnes Gooch.  However, the daily rushes of the day's filming indicated she was running away with the film, and Lucy had her fired. Madeline Kahn was a very fine comedienne and photographed quite beautifully.
Believe it or not, notwithstanding all of the negatives evident in Lucy's Mame, I am still glad to have this dvd.  It is the only filmed musical Mame, and I love the music.  No matter what is going wrong in my world, or with any given day, the songs always lift my spirits, whether they are song by Lucy or preferably Angela Lansbury.",1249430400,6,1306,4.990783410138249

284709,2,6300268853,"I'm a big fan of the Rosalind Russell flick Auntie Mame, so after viewing Mame I've gotta say it can't help but feel like a redundant, paler imitation of the earlier classic. Lucy gives her all here, but it's really hard to get past the fact that she seems too old for the part - and starting out with the starkly dark, Rosalind Russell-like wig doesn't help matters. I have to think if she'd played the role on stage she could've sold the part more convincingly. Since this is based on the Broadway musical, you do get to hear some pretty good tunes like ""We Need a Little Christmas"" and ""Bosom Buddies,"" even if they are sung really badly. The latter does transcend it's ear-assaulting delivery because watching Ball perform it with Bea Arthur, who plays Vera, Mame's best friend, is really kind of fun. Robert Preston also makes a pretty good turn as Mame's love interest Beauregard, and he gets to sing ""Loving You"" (written especially for the film), which is a real treat since he's far and away the only member of the cast that can actually sing. Mame clocks in at just over two hours, but it felt more like three or four. Despite the frenetic pace of the production numbers, the movie seems to lag (this is a problem I have with a lot of the musicals from the late sixties/early seventies - the come off too heavy-handed for me which bogs down the pace of the story). The DVD has a trailer and a featurette entitled ""Lucky Mame"" which is basically a glorfied, really long trailer. While Lucy has some good moments here (the fox hunt scene comes to mind), she is never quite able to match the magic touch Rosalind Russell brought to the character of Mame. In summary - this may be worth watching once if you're a fan of Robert Preston, or want to see Bea Arthur positively steal every scene she appears in. Other than that, skip this one and check out the superior Auntie Mame.",1236988800,,1883,4.460869565217391
284710,2,6300268853,"Critics at the time complained that ""Mame"" was over-produced, but you simply can't stage a musical-version of ""Auntie Mame"" and not have it be splashy, with all the trimmings. The hit Broadway musical, based on Patrick Dennis' autobiography originally filmed as the non-musical ""Auntie Mame"" in 1958, had a lot of people crying foul in 1974 (they were ""anti-Mame""). The by-passing of Broadway's Angela Lansbury for the title role lead to nothing but criticisms for this new Mame, Lucille Ball. For her part, Ball is to be commended for giving a distinctly old-fashioned show everything she's got, and she has a handful of amusing scenes despite a sandpaper singing voice. The plot is the same: orphaned boy goes to live with his merry, madcap aunt in 1920s New York and learns about life. Robert Preston is well-cast as a romantic suitor, and Beatrice Arthur is wonderful reprising her Tony-winning role as gal-pal Vera Charles. There just isn't enough meat on this story for a two hour-plus movie, and portions of the picture creak and sag with the weight of sentimentality. While the pacing is uneven--and a musical montage at the finish line is grueling--the players do try hard keeping everything bubbly, and there are some laughs early on.

It was truly one of the greatest crimes in modern cinema to have cast Lucille Ball over Angela Lansbury, and watching this movie only confirms the fact that the world was absolutely robbed by the film makers shameful decision to cast Ball in this cringe inducing performance.

284713,3,6300268853,"I feel Lucille Ball should have a A for effort, because she was trying to fight Hollywood.  She knew most stars are put away by the time they are 62, and she could see her TV audience slowly slip away.  (The 1972-73 season of Here's Lucy was only #15!)  So, Lucy wanted to try to get back into movies.  I have heard Angela's version and seen clips on YouTube.  I feel that Angela, of course, sings better, but lacks the charm of Lucy.  I don't care about how they covered up Lucy's age, because she had to play a woman thirty years younger than her at the beginning of the movie.  She acted te best she could for her age, and it is nice to see that Mame was released on VHS before her death.  Also, when she received awards in the 80s, they would mention Mame.  I love the fox hunt and store scenes.  I also agree with the New York Times.  Open a New Window and Mame are first-rate production numbers.  Open a New Window, to me, showcases Lucy's best singing.  I found the movie easy to follow and it captures the spirit of the period.  I especially like Robert Preston's solo; his relationship with Mame is the warmth part of the movie save for Lucy's interaction with young Patrick.  I find Bea Arthur only good in the Bosom Buddies number.  I find she is too stiff and unattractive throughout the movie.  I find Jane Cornell as okay, but really, who would think she could have a baby at her age back in the 1930s/40s?  I find the swearing understandable but annoying.  Overall, Lucy does her best, and the movie ages well.  She may not sing like she could twenty years earlier in the Long, Long Trailer, but she still is the best chorus girl and actress around, especially in the second part where she is allowed to show her true age.",1231804800,7,1737,4.302469135802469

284761,1,6300268853,"Lucille Ball made a career out of playing talentless housewife Lucy to the talented Ricky Ricardo on `I Love Lucy'; a television series that seriously is one of the best of all time.  Making her character lovable and impressionable took a great deal of talent.  `I Love Lucy' proved that Lucille Ball was a spitfire, a comedic genius and it catapulted her into the hall of fame as one of the greatest of all television icons.

Until last night I had never seen Lucille in a film.

Sadly, my first experience with Lucy on the big screen was her last effort, `Mame', a film that is hit or miss all over the place with sadly more misses than any serious hits.  Lucille Ball is a comedic hit, but a musical was not the right route for her to take.  Now, I have not seen the Broadway play from which this spawns, but I can only imagine that the lead actress was required to sing, and sing well.  Lucy cannot sing well.

`Mame' tells the story of young Patrick Dennis who goes to live with his eccentric Aunt after his father dies.  Mame is not really a responsible parent, but she loves Patrick and her unconditional love outweighs her lack of parenting skills.

The film is somewhat clich&eacute;d, and it feels very tired in many parts.  The musical numbers feel unrehearsed and out of tune and just all over the place.  Not only is Ball a terrible singer, but so is Kirby Furlong, who plays young Dennis.  In fact, the only saving grace here is Beatrice Arthur who delivers brilliantly as Vera Charles, Mame's boozy best friend.  She's not only funny, but she can sing and dance and perform her hide off.

As a comedian, Ball sells her scenes.  It's sad that she allowed herself to take this role knowing that she was not right for it, for the film just accentuates the areas in which Ball lacked talent instead of embellishing the areas in which she shined.  I can't recommend the film for it feels incomplete, choppy and unnecessary.  Aside from Arthur there is nothing noteworthy about the film (aside from a few funny, non-musical related scenes).",1220572800,13,2049,4.536784741144414

Lucy is the best Mame every; she can dance, sing, make you laugh and bring tears to your eyes.  The pairing of Bea Arthur and Lucy is classic.  Their ""Bosom Buddies"" number is first class.  Robert Preston, Jane Connell, Bruce Davison and Kirby Furlong are all first rate.  I'm glad that this movie musical from 1974 has found a new audience.  It truly is one of Lucy's best performances on the big screen and is great entertainment for the entire family.  Warner Brothers was very smart in releasing this film.  Too bad there aren't many extras.  Angela Lansbury's and Rosalind Russell's versions of Mame pale in comparison to Miss Lucille Ball.

Yes, any number of movie stars (certainly Lansbury, but maybe Shirley MacLaine) would have made a better Mame.  Lucy is far older than the role requires, and she truly can't sing.  But call it The ""Chicago"" Syndrome: Having lived through Renee Zellwegger and Michelle Pfeiffer's singing over the past few years, I somehow don't mind Lucy as much.  (And let's not forget that Rosiland Russell, first choice for the musical version, was no singer either.)  Lucy can certainly dance (that's how she started her career), she's damned funny (this is Lucy, after all), and she's giving it 200% and seems to be having a blast -- so as a complete performance, it's surprisingly valid.  The costumes and art direction are gorgeous, and Jerry Herman's arrangements of his lovely score are really splendid; and the supporting cast is first-rate across the boards.  One wishes that Gene Saks were a more imaginative director, but his work is perfectly serviceable.  So while this is one of those movie musicals that might have been fantastic with a more appropriate leading lady, it's hardly the out-and-out disaster that I remembered and expected to see again.

284776,1,6300268853,"First off, the negative reviews based on a dislike of the stage musical in general are off the mark. The musical is a thing of its own, and shouldn't be expected to equal the incomparable Rosalind Russell non-musical version. I doubt that many musicals based on movies or plays are as good as the originals--look how terrible a musical (""Applause"") was concocted from the brilliant ""All About Eve."" If you don't like Broadway musicals, that's a matter of personal taste. That said, however, I must concur that this movie really blows. I remember being appalled when it first came out, when I was at the height of my Lucille Ball mania. It was--and is--simply uncomfortable to watch. If somehow they could have put Miss Ball in a time machine and taken her back to her 40s, when she was at her height in ""I Love Lucy,"" it would have been great. The sets and costumes and jaw-dropping Art Deco, and the supporting cast is fine in its overly stagey way. But poor Lucy--one critic said she is so out of focus that it looks as though she was filmed through canvas, not gauze; and I believe it was Pauline Kael who said it sounds as if her singing had been dubbed by Dick Cavett. There was talk a while back about a TV remake with Barbra Streisand as Mame and Cher as Vera--now THERE would have been something to see.

I thought Lucille Ball was the best Mame, I saw the 1950s version and thought it was terrible.  Bea Arthur was also incredible.  Interesting the difference in perspective when this was the first version you saw, versus some who were around to see the first adaptation and broadway play.  Having grown up on I Love Lucy reruns,her taking on the role of Mame made me love her acting ability even more.  I can't wait to share this movie with my kids!",1199145600,2,688,4.3700787401574805
284784,3,6300268853,"I saw this film at Radio City Music Hall when it was first released and, immediately after, dragged my mother a few blocks north to Sam Goody to buy the soundtrack -- it made quite an impression on my then 11-year-old self.  I remember all the hoopla that attended its release: Baskin Robbins even had a Lucy-as-Mame inspired ice cream flavor!  (Was it peach?)

Watching the DVD today, I can see that the film has its problems.  These are not unique to Mame, however, but are shared with nearly all the bloated, overlong musicals of the late 60s and early 70s (Hello Dolly, Star!, Doctor Doolittle, among them): the production overwhelms the story, which is, frankly, pretty slight.  Most of the second half is just silly stuff: Gooch's night on the town, Patrick's fiance's snobby, bigoted family, Vera's return to Mame's side.  The movie feels too long.

I had absolutely no problem with Lucille Ball's close-ups.  Who cares whether they used a filter?  They did the same thing with Doris Day in every movie she made from Pillow Talk on, as well as her TV show.  It served not only to mask wrinkles, but also to create a romantic mood, to idealize a star.  In Mame, there are plenty of medium shots with no filtering whatsoever.  You're never thinking that Lucy is striving to look 30.  Overall, she looks terrific and her costumes are flattering and often witty.  She was a big star and she got the star treatment.  That's part of what makes the film irresistable today -- you don't see that kind of care and craftsmanship much today.  Lucy is in nearly every frame, her name is above the title, she SHOULD be allowed look great.

Lucy's not really right for the role, of course.  She's an everywoman clown, not a witty sophisticate.  She lacks the bite of a Roz Russell (or Eve Arden) in her delivery.  But she's extremely likeable and at times moving.  Yes, she's a decade or two older than the character as originally conceived, but so what?  She is no Mae West in Sextette -- there's nothing creepy about her in the role.  Julie Andrews was at least a decade older than Maria Von Trapp was supposed to be in Sound of Music, Audrey Hepburn even older than that as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady.  Remember, Lucy had been playing at least a decade younger since I Love Lucy, and quite convincingly.  In her prime she was great looking.

Lucy doesn't have much of a voice but she pulls off the songs.  Mame does not need to be a singer.  Lucy dances gracefully and seems pretty spry to me.  Whether she is having a good time, however, is hard to tell. I read that she was very anxious during the production, and sometimes her frivolity feels forced. Was her heart really in it?  Who knows...

All the sets are overlit, there's very little texture to the film.  Most of the interior scenes feel like an Aaron Spelling production: too bright, too clean, too 70s.  The supporting cast is strong and Beatrice Arthur is very, very funny.  She and Lucy have good chemistry, as do she and Robert Preston, who doesn't have much to do, sadly.

The problem is the musical adaptation itself: the songs sentimentalize the already sentimental story.  Many of them -- particularly the title number -- break the flow of the story and dull the original play's acid wit.  It's hard for me to imagine this being any better with Angela Lansbury, who was never a particularly charismatic screen presence.

Watch Mame for the good songs, high energy, camp value, lavish production, and of course, Lucy.  It's certainly worth revisiting.",1193875200,9,3520,4.625201938610663

284832,1,6300268853,"Lucille Ball was a mighty power in television throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but she still made an occasional film, most notably THE LONG, LONG TRAILER and THE FACTS OF LIFE.  Although her television career remained strong, as the 1970s began her movie career seemed to be winding down--but Ball was determined to have one last big screen fling, and the project she selected was the 1966 musical MAME.

In many respects the role seemed tailor-made: based on the popular novel which gave rise to two different Broadway plays, Mame Dennis is a wacky, wildly uninhibited woman who ""inherits"" her orphaned nephew Patrick--and leads him on a wild tour of life's possibilities, bouncing from one comic spree to another.  The music, which featured such songs as ""Open a New Window"" and ""If He Walked Into My Life Today,"" was among Jerry Herman's best work.  The supporting cast, which included Robert Preston and Bea Arthur, was the best of the best.  Expectations were high; opening night fanfare was tremendous; the film was a disaster.  Critics were aghast and audiences sat slack-jawed.

No matter what hardcore Lucy fans may say, MAME is a fiasco, so much so that it is hard to know where to start.  It is badly directed, badly filmed, badly performed, and there Lucille Ball is at the center of it all, unable to dance, unable to sing, and grinning like a waxworks dummy while incredibly bad choreography swirls around her.  But the disaster is hardly of her making alone; the supporting cast fares no better.  Bea Arthur and Jane Connell recreate their stage roles of Vera Charles and Agnes Gooch; the former is stagey, the latter is dismal.  Robert Preston manages to sing with a smile, but he's pretty much on his own and clearly none too happy about it.

The DVD brings the film from the VHS pan-and-scan release to widescreen, but that only means there's more awfullness to see.  Everybody loves Lucy, but only the least critical fan could love Lucy's MAME; while I wouldn't say it's bad enough to make you want to gouge your eyes out, you may wish you had.  Not recommended.

True, Lucille Ball may not be the best singer in the world but the songs for ""Mame"" don't require a great singing voice.  Aside from the singing aspect, which I think Lucy did a good job, I think this is one of Lucy's best screen performances.  She was nominated for a Golden Globe in 1974 for Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy film - she lost to Raquel Welch for ""The Three Musketeers"" (?)  The musical numbers in ""Mame"" are truly outstanding.  The numbers are expertly performed by not only Lucy but the entire cast.  Lucy should have been nominated for an Academy Award but I guess the film just came out at the wrong time (1974).  There just weren't any musicals of this kind being released in 1974.  We had junk like ""Last Tango In Paris"" and ""The Exorcist.""  Lucy was at the height of her popularity in 1974 and I guess when you're at the top, the critics like to tear you down.

performers are excellent but did not have what it took to erase the memory of the Broadway stars of the same
musicals. Lucille Ball, while having her own unique talents, brought nothing positive to her role as Lucy Mame as the marquees called it. It should have been Angela Lansbury who acts, is a comic, captured the role, dances and
sings. Lucille Ball is a comic but she couldn't carry this one. As zany as she was on I Love Lucy, her subsequent shows deteriorated terribly and she never regained her talent. That brings her to this flop. She had no sense of
comedy or caricature, sang in a low, raspy, unappealing voice. It felt painful to experience this movie. It just had flop fever. Even Beatrice Arthur who can do almost anything in any medium seemed uncomfortable in her role.

284869,4,6300268853,"Ok, sorry for the really lame title, I had nothing else.

Mame has had quite the long history in entertainment. I won't go into that however. Instead, I'll dimply focus on the musical, which first opened to critical acclaim and massive success on Broadway in 1966 with Angela Lansbury as Mame Dennis, Bea Arthur as Vera Charles, and Jane Connell as Agnes Gooch. Angela and Bea both won well-deserved Tony Awards for their performances.

Cut to 1974. After two years, much of which was spent waiting for Lucille Ball to heal from a broken leg sustained from a skiing accident, Mame finally opens in theaters to little box office success and is torn to pieces by film critics. The major criticisms of the film are Lucy's lack of singing prowess, the fact that she was about 20-30 years older than the character she was portraying, and the resulting gauze and Vaseline used on the camera lens on close-up shots of Lucy to make her appear much younger. Those who don't care for the film feel that Bea Arthur, who had just become a major television star thanks to Maude, and Jane Connell, who reprised their roles from the original Broadway show, were the film's only saving grace. The box office failure and lambasting from critics deeply hurt Lucille Ball, and despite Golden Globe nominations for Lucy and Bea, Lucy would never make another big screen film.

Despite everything, Mame amassed a small but loyal fanbase upon its release. Through subsequent TV airings and video and laserdisc releases, its fanbase has grown quite considerably. Today, it seems as if for everyone person or two who hates the film, there's one who's a big fan.

I, personally, am a fan, albeit a new one. After only hearing the soundtrack for the first time this year, I found that despite Lucy's...interesting vocal stylings, I actually enjoyed the soundtrack. I quite liked the songs, and I enjoyed getting to hear Bea Arthur sing on two of the tracks. And I became interested in seeing this movie...which was good timing, as I heard this soundtrack just a mere couple of months before the DVD was released. I only saw it earlier this month on an old pan-and-scan VHS tape, but that was enough to put me under its spell. And just this week, my DVD copy of the film arrived from Amazon, and I must say, it's absolutely stunning on DVD.

Now that I've rambled on about all that crap I'm sure you don't care about, lemme get to what matters - what's the DVD presentation like?

The video transfer is absolutely excellent. It's obvious a clean film element was used for the DVD, although there's some occasional anomalies that don't really take away from the viewing experience. And no, I'm not talking about Lucy's soft-focus closeups. It's very clean and virtually devoid of scratches and dirt. The color has also been touched up very nicely. And it's nice to finally have the film in widescreen, where it can be appreciated. And if I may say so, the widescreen presentation actually makes those soft-focus closeups a little less noticeable.

The audio transfer is equally excellent. Warner Bros. has spent years trying to make an acceptable audio transfer. Unfortunately, they were unable to. The main reason being Lucy's singing vocals, which were cobbled together line by line, and in some cases, according to composer Jerry Herman, some lines had to be further pieced together note by note. This is quite apparent at many times on the soundtrack CD, but not as apparent on the film's mono soundtrack, which due to the inability to create an acceptable stereo track, had to be used for the DVD's audio source. However, this Dolby Digital 1.0 mono soundtrack beautifully sparkles, with no pops, hisses, or noise distortion, and very little of that overdubbing and cobbling together of multiple lines and notes to create Lucy's singing vocals actually shows on the track. Since this is a musical, it would have been nice if Warner could have managed to make a 5.1, or even a 4.0 or a 2.0 Dolby Digital track, but at least you're hearing it the way audience members in theaters heard it in 1974.

The DVD is sadly very light on bonus materials. I don't imagine Warner Bros. kept too much of anything pertaining to this film after its critical and financial disaster. Which is sad, because we know there's deleted shots and scenes, including a few lines from Bosom Buddies which, although are preserved on the soundtrack album, were cut from the film. It would have been nice if they could have possibly given us some deleted footage, maybe any kind of screen tests, costume tests, makeup tests, etc. All we get here are the original 3-minute theatrical trailer and a vintage featurette, Lucky Mame, which is basically the trailer but five minutes longer. Maybe some TV featurettes, interviews, and such could have been included as well.

Despite being light on bonus features, this DVD is absolutely certain to please the fans who've been waiting all these years for this very entertaining film to be available. At last we finally get a beautiful presentation of the film with amazing video and audio, even if it is only mono. Despite its obvious shortcomings, this film delivers on entertainment and is a visual feast. Lucy looks as beautiful as ever, and Bea Arthur steals every scene she's in. If you're a fan, there's really no question about whether you should pick this DVD up, because the answer is yes. If you've never seen it, or you have and you'd like to see it again for re-appraisal, I'd suggest renting it from Netflix first. Mame is one of those films where there's no real middle ground - you either absolutely love it or you absolutely hate it. I absolutely love it, and the DVD makes a wonderful addition to my collection of film musicals. She can definitely coax the blues out of my heart any day. Ok, I need to stop these lame lyric references.",1187654400,6,5841,4.7467980295566505
284870,2,6300268853,"I saw this movie musical version of Mame twice, once around 1977 or 1978, and again in 1980.  And although I'm sure I have forgotten some of it's virtues, I haven't forgotten Lucy's singing, and how inadequate it was for this role.  I never could figure out why they didn't put Angela Lansbury in the film version.  But then again, even at a rather young age, I was suspicious of Hollywood's take on Broadway musicals after seeing Barbra Streisand in Hello Dolly (which I didn't think was anything special, either, but at least Streisand could sing).",1187481600,2,550,4.708333333333333

284872,5,6300268853,"Here's what you need to know about this film:  It's a great movie.  It was considered a flop in it's day (1973/4 wasn't exactly the height of musical movie making).  But compared to anything of today, it's simply amazing!

What you should also know, is that there's a lot of politics that surrounded this project:
1.  It was a great book by Patrick Dennis (Around The World With Auntie Mame)
2.  It was a great play starring Rosalind Russell (Auntie Mame)
3.  It was a great movie starring Rosalind Russell (Auntie Mame)
4.  It was a great broadway musical starring Angela Lansbury (Mame)
5.  It is a great hollywood movie-musical version of #4.

By the time this movie came out, people couldn't get over the travesty of not hiring the amazing Angela Lansbury.  Okay, so Lucy is no Angela, but Angela is no Lucy.  Get over it!  I realize, Lucy, while a great actress and comedianne, is no singer.  But getting past that, the film is still unfairly compared by many, line by line, frame by frame to the book, the play, the movie, and the musical.  Of course people are going to complain.

Now erase all that BS, forget the turmoil, and watch this film for what it is, a GREAT movie on it's own, and you will love it.  It's funny, it's sad, it's beautiful, and everyone I know who has seen it absolutely loves it!

Robert Preston is so well cast, I don't think he ever lets us down.  Bea Arthur is funnier here than she was on Maude or Golden Girls!  And Jane Connell, a long-time broadway talent knows how to deliver with her innocent naive Agnes Gooch.  And, pun intended... I love lucy!

Now, about the DVD itself, I think the film has never looked better, and it's nice to finally see it in Letterbox the way it should have always been seen!  Okay, so it's not in 5.1 surround sound, but it sounds the way it was meant to sound in 1973, and it looks better than ever.

Here's who I don't recommend it to:
Biggots (it's definitely not your film)
Musical-haters (what would be the point of watching?)
Angela Lansbury (it's like asking Julie Andrews to watch My Fair Lady).

If you don't fit those categories, then I highly recommend it.  Give it a chance and live, live LIVE!",1186358400,3,2175,4.429292929292929
284873,3,6300268853,"What a viewer response to the release of Lucy's MAME ! As with most films, some loved it, some hated it, some were in the middle---but most were quite straightforward in their reviews. The overwhelming opinion is that the wonderful Jerry Herman songs sung by Mame should have been dubbed, and that is a fair assessment. Like millions of others, I think Lucy is great, but let's be honest--she would have come off a lot more successfully in this role if she hadn't tried to sing. (Not a great executive decision.) The photographic tricks to hide her age aren't so bad, really--come on, she's not the first actress to come down the pike who was not the ideal age for her role, and she looks pretty darn good overall. Seems to be general agreement, and rightly so, about the first-class production values, score (the added song for Robert Preston, ""Loving You"", is very good) and supporting cast: Bea Arthur, especially, can do no wrong as Vera Charles.  Is the movie worth watching? I'd have to say Yes...it's true that it takes a bit to get used to Lucy in this role---and while she isn't Angela Lansbury or Roz Russell, by mid-film you just have to root for her. Here's an idea:  We could enjoy the sumptuous production and look of the film and still enjoy the musical score if Warners releases it next time using Lansbury's vocals !

When the musical was made, Angela Lansbury should have been allowed to recreate her character for the screen, but instead the role was given to Lucy as a ""last hurrah.""  I understand that, but Lucy (and I do love Lucy) was too far past her prime to do justice to the role for the movie.  The production was super lavish, and everything was wonderful (including Bea Arthur) except for the leading lady.  But because I love the show so, I had to have the DVD of MAME anyway.

284906,1,6300268853,"For lovers of the original and sparkling ""Auntie Mame"" starring Roz Russell, this musical film version, based on the Broadway musical, is a real disaster. What is usually not mentioned is the fact that Lucy BOUGHT her way into this film, putting up $5 million of her own money so that she could star in it herself. Really, the audacity of her thinking she could pull this off is beyond comprehension. Miss Ball was simply out of her league with this project. Horribly miscast, Ball does a lot of primping in mirrors and posing a lot, but never comes remotely close to capturing the essence of the character. She seems more interested in looking good than making us believe she is Mame Dennis. Lucy was charming and funny in her ""I Love Lucy"" days, but they were far behind her by this time, and the fact that she was 62 years old, playing a character who was at least a couple of decades younger than that, added to the problems. Gene Saks (Bea Arthur's husband at the time) directed the stage musical with gusto, but does not have the skills to turn the sublime wackiness of the stage show into an equally effective film. Everything seems off, including the often abrupt editing, and the soft-focus photography for Lucy's closeups is glaringly obvious. The long-running joke on ""I Love Lucy"" was that she couldn't carry a tune to save her life, and what does she do here? She tries to pass herself off as a singer! Unbelievable that this movie was even made with her in the starring role. But Warner Bros. green-lit it anyway, and here it is, the worst musical anyone could ever attempt to sit through. On top of it all, it's not funny either, the exact opposite of ""Auntie Mame"", which is so funny you cry with laughter, even with umpteen viewings. The 1958 version is the ONLY one to see. Watch Lucy's ""Mame"" only if you are a glutton for punishment. Lucy as Mame does not convince us that she is a free-thinking liberal; in fact, she comes across as downright conservative (which I think was the real Lucy anyway) and rather cold-hearted. Not even the presence of the wonderful Bea Arthur can save this mess. Do yourself a favor and stick with the one-and-only Rosalind Russell in ""Auntie Mame"".",1184716800,6,2199,4.583756345177665

First let's get the not-so-good out of the way--yes they did overuse the contrast filter (or whatever you call it) a bit much and yes, Lucy is not the best singer in the world. This latter note is really only a minor flaw as they way they staged the musical numbers covers up this fact most of the time. And finally the Gloria Epson character is good but not as funny as in the non-musical version. Now the good - it's entertaining from start to finish with never a dull moment. Lucy adds a lot of heart to the character. Beatrice Arthur and Jane Connell are hilarious as Vera and Agnes respectively. Robert Preston is wonderful as always. It's filmed beautifully and it has some wonderfully staged musical numbers. In my opinion the Mame musical number which takes place at the plantation is one of the best ever done on screen.

I think she is triumphant.  This movie is just full of heart and soul. The saddest part is that Warner Bros. just put it out without any care or thought. I cannot believe its in mono!

Lucy was a great commedienne in her day, but when it comes to singing... it's two thumbs WAY DOWN!!  She cannot carry a tune, her voice sounds froggy, and all of her close-up shots are ""blurred"" to prevent you from seeing her wrinkles (she made this film in her 60's, and MAME is a 30 or 40-something character!)  Yes, the film has good musical numbers when the whole cast is involved, but Lucy just brings it all down whenever she sings solo... especially with those Vaseline-covered lens close-ups!  UGH!

I can only hope that some day they will re-make this disaster!  I recently saw MAME on stage with CHRISTINE BARANSKI.  What a wonderful performance!  (Hint Hint to Hollywood!)

If you love the story of MAME, I suggest purchasing (or renting) AUNTIE MAME with ROSALIND RUSSELL.  No, it's not a musical, but it's a great comedy performed by great actors.

284911,4,6300268853,"I am a big fan of ""Mame"" and was lucky enough to see Angela Lansbury in the 1986 Broadway revival. This is wonderful show and a great role for an actress, so as good as Lansbury was, it can and should be played by others who are up to it. Was Lucille Ball? I agree with the reviewer who said that at first, she seems not really right for the role. I am not sure if she was too old (although she looks great & Mame is not supposed to be a young woman) or if it is because she is not much of a singer (although she can carry the tunes in her low, husky key; it is musical comedy, not opera). Maybe it is because we all know her as Lucy Ricardo, etc. and cannot get that out of our minds?

But.... once the story moves along, she wins me over every time. By the time she gets through the really hilarious foxhunt and is found holding the little fox, flashing a truly million dollar smile, I think of the line in the song ""you're just sensational, truly inspirational, Mame"". As such a great clown, it was easy for audiences to forget that Lucy was a really beautiful woman, even in her 60's. Her figure is trim and she is dressed in one great period outfit after another. She is warm and funny, as well as elegant, witty, and even bitchy when required. Just right for Mame.

I am not saying that Lucy is the best Mame. But she was a great star and a big personality. That works for Mame. With Bea Arthur as a truly hilarious, dry, and deadpan Vera and an expanded role (and extra song) for Robert Preston as Beau, Lucy has great co-stars.

1.  This dvd IS Anamorphic Widescreen, not Letterboxed, as has been reported.  It is also a progressive transfer.

2.  The film of MAME was never in stereo, not even in the theatres.  It was always a mono film. George Feltenstein of Warner Home Video has said they spent quite a while trying to remix the tracks to stereo for dvd release, but were unable to because, among other reasons, of the tracks being pieced together so piecemeal to accomodate Lucy's vocals. Even the IMDB incorrectly states it was in Stereo, but it was indeed a Mono release theatrically.

So rest assured, if you are fan of the film or of Lucy, you are NOT missing anything with this dvd.  The sound is the original mono, as heard in the theatres in 1974, and is quite satisfactory.  And the picture is a very nice anamorphic transfer with few blemishes.",1182384000,66,890,4.617834394904459

Where are the extras that would make MORE people purchase this DVD? They should have taken a cue from how various studios have released some movies-so-bad-they're-good. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is packed with extras including two versions of the movie and TWO commentary tracks (by the director and one by Raquel Welch that actually helps make sense of the film, not to mention spills lots of good gossip about the plagued production). The DVD release of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS has so many extras its on two disks and has not only several newly-made documentaries but a riotous commentary track with Barbara Parkins and Ted Casablanca.

As we've seen, a commentary track doesn't have to be complimentary; it just has to be interesting. Who didn't think about getting Charles Busch to do a commentary (he's not only played Auntie Mame on stage various times but he's a veteran of commentaries--listen to his fun one on DIE MOMMY DIE and the one he made with Patty McCormick for THE BAD SEED; he also joins Lypsinka for an informative commentary on WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?).

Why not get a commentary from Richard Tyler Jordan (who wrote BUT DARLING I'M YOUR AUNTIE MAME) or Eric Myers (who wrote UNCLE MAME)? Or at least create a new documentary using these two film scholars/biographers. And while Lucille Ball is gone, her two children Desi and Lucie have always been game about contributing interviews for their mom's product (their joint commentaries on the HERE'S LUCY set makes the whole package worth purchasing).

There have been plenty of Lucille Ball biographies written recently--couldn't anyone approach those authors about contributing to a documentary? And what about talking to those survivors of this 1974 film? Director Gene Saks, Bea Arthur, Bruce Davison, Jane Connell, Kirby Furlong, and Joyce Van Patten are all still here. Not to mention the wonderful Jerry Herman--whose thoughts on this adaptation would be great to preserve.

What about including the episode ""Lucy Meets Lucille Ball"" from the final season of HERE'S LUCY where Lucy Carter ran into Lucille Ball on the set on MAME?

It's just such a missed opportunity to create something special. The same missed opportunity as when Warner Home Video released the classic AUNTIE MAME without any extras (save the ability to listen to the musical score without the soundtrack--wow, there's a special feature everyone is clamoring for!).

Now, 33 years later...not so much. The film looks colorful and expensive (it was), and some of it is really quite good (the title number, etc.). But, for the most part, my impression now--as a grown-up--is one of forced merriment. Everyone in the film has these huge smiles pasted to their faces, and they all dash around being bright and clever, and I don't believe a moment of it.

My favorite critic, the late Pauline Kael, wrote this in the New Yorker at the time: ""Too terrible to be boring; you can get fixated staring at it and wondering what exactly Lucille Ball thinks she's doing. When that sound comes out, does she think she's singing? When she throws up her arms, in their red giant-bat-wing sleeves, and cries out 'Listen, everybody!' does she really think she's a fun person?""

I think Kael nailed it--there is an artificial quality to all this that really damages the whole enterprise.

It would be interesting to see if people would have been more kind in reviews if they had used another persons singing voice. The only thing that really bothered me was the constant use of soft focus wherever there was a shot of Lucy. I am sure this was something she wanted to make her look a bit younger than she was. So you can see by all of these different opinions, you either love this film or hate it. If you have never seen it, I would give it a chance.

It is dead from the beginng, no life at all, and Lucy seems to know it.

Did Auntie Mame ever really need music? Esp. of this awful sort?? Roz Russell reigns over all remakers and their casts. Her film is IT, and Herman and Lucy should have known better.

I saw Lucy in Wildcat years ago..very funny, very unconventional,but limiting. Her kind of comedy is in the Marx Bros. tradition; and this is her genuius, not this stuff. Even Angela L. had trouble with Mamme's terrible lyrics and serious moments.

Poor Lucy..she needed a better attraction than this, and the director, notoriously bad.

Forget this and go to Roz Russell and Lucy's TV show from the 50's, not the later shows from the 60's, which have Mameish qualities that are best avoided.",1181347200,7,954,4.555555555555555

284975,1,6300268853,"A great film of ""Mame"" could have been made with Angela Lansbury (a tentative cast of Lansbury, Bette Davis as Vera and Carol Burnett as Gooch was at hand briefly), or a number of other stars, but instead Lucille Ball grabbed it. Too old (and this is emphasized by the only time I think vaseline was literally smeared on the lens for her closeups - either that or the entire audience is going blind collectively for brief periods), Lucille Ball was a brittle comic presence on the large screen, even cold - she might have been able to play Vera. Madeline Kahn was fired because Ball picked a fight with her (too good?), but Jane Connell is good as Gooch if not as great as she was on stage. Ditto for Beatrice Arthur, who seems happy to just be there. She damn near stole the show on stage. The only thing right here is Robert Preston and his new song, and he quickly falls off an alp unfortunately.

The key to the part of Mame is great warmth and emotional variety under the style. It's just not here. Angela Lansbury knew film better than stage and would have brought more things to this film than she did to the part on Broadway. One of the great lost opportunities, right up there with Julie Andrews in ""My Fair Lady"". Hollywood is often too clever for its own good, and several potential Oscars and a lot of money were kicked away. Literally better to spend your money on a CD of the original cast and watch the Rosalind Russell film of the source ""Auntie Mame"". In my opinion this performance actually dimmed my enjoyment of ""I Love Lucy"" later. Some feel differently.",1180224000,9,1575,4.431034482758621
284976,5,6300268853,"I absolutely adore this fim.  Yes, I am a 100 % true Lucille Ball fan.  Her mere presence is heaven for me.  This film came out when I was 16 and seeing it at the movies had me spellbound.  Lucy was so beautiful and for me, WAS Mame.  The main number had me in tears.

Seeing the film now over 20 times and being 46 years old, I feel so bad for Lucy. Critics were prepared to pan this film before even seeing it. I give her 1000 % credit for using her real voice for singing. Sure, she's not gifted vocally but for me it made the character more real and the songs more emotional.

She was wonderful in the dance numbers and she had just gotten over a broken leg.  Her age hindered her in no way in this film.  Her own insecurities did though.  The gauze used to film her close ups are jarring and make one wonder why it was used. Did she look so old, so bad?

The answer to this is NO.  I saw her up very close in person in Boston when she got the Hasty Pudding award just a couple of years before her very sad demise.  She looked lovely and amazing for her age. She was a pure joy seeing her be herself.  She did not need the special effects to hide her age in the film.

For all her glory and fame, she didn't believe it and all these twinks in the film were due to this.  I feel so sad.  When she passed she felt she was very alone and that her fans had deserted her. I hope she saw from above how the world stopped when she died.

But for me she wasn't just Lucy, she was Lucille Ball -  a woman and actress.  I am very surprised that no critics praised her for what I found great and subtle dramatic acting in the second half of the film when Patrick was an adult and she dealt with the infamous inlaws and bigotry.  This was great acting and not Lucy.

Not to say she didn't put some very funny Lucy moments in the film like her interaction with a store dummy.  And the main number itself is pure movie magic.

People just wouldn't let her not be Lucy. It's a shame.  Critics watched this movie with rose colored glasses of negativity.

284981,4,6300268853,"Okay, Okay. Maybe some of you are right to think that Lucy may have been miscast as Mame. Obviously her singing voice leaves much to be desired. But if you look at her eyes when she realizes that it's Patrick who's just shown up, or the way that she expresses her love as she looks at Beau, she's enchanting! For me she is so believable as the excentric Mame. Could Angela Lansbury pull the faces of utter terror as she roller skated through the largest department store in New York, yet retaining her dignity at the same time? Lucy has always been known for that kind of 'prat-fall' comedy, and she doesn't disappoint as Mame! With expressions and a deep voice filled with contempt, she lets it be known just what she thinks of the upper-class, snobbish people that her one and only family mamber is about to join. I don't think that this was such a miscast as so many people believe. I think those of you who complain about this show have focused too much on Lucy's singing voice, ruined by so many years of smoking, and have forgotten to look at the Lucy that we all came to love first as an MGM Glamour Girl, then as the Lucy who always wanted to be 'in the show' and continued antics with Viv in the 60's. Angela Lansbury was stellar on Broadway, and she was wonderful as Jessica Fletcher in Murder, She Wrote, but would she translate the roll of Mame to film as well? Perhaps. But it had been a long time since she'd been on the silver screen, and let's face it, not all Broadway stars can make the transition to a film adaptation. So give Lucy what Lucy is due. This film was made with very limited resources, and I think that they did a wonderful job with what they had.

I was all ready a huge Lucy fan from the reruns of ""I Love Lucy"" on local channel 11 KTTV here in Los Angeles.  So, when I went with my family to see ""Mame"" at The Cinerama Dome, I was in heaven.....in awe!  To see ""Lucy"" up on the big screen singing and dancing, it transported me to another place.  I remember it clearly, all these many, many, many years later as if it just happened earlier today.

Looking back at the film now, I can be a little more objective.  It didn't even occur to me at the age of 9 that Lucille Ball couldn't sing. or, perhaps, was miscast.  Should Angela Lansbury have done the film??  Probably.  Would it have been a better film?  Probably.  Madeline Kahn would have been fantastic as Gooch, had she not been fired.

Lucille Ball's costumes are stunning, she never looked better.  The title number is well worth the price of admission.  It's a complete showstopper!  Bea Arthur is brilliant as Vera Charles.  Robert Preston is fantastic as Beau and with his extra song, ""Loving You,"" makes him the perfect leading man for Lucille Ball.

When I watch this film on video, it takes me to another place.  What I remember is the piece, the film.  Can you remember where you were when you first saw it?  That's what's important about art...not the reviews, not the number of awards it did or didn't win.  Did it touch people's lives?  Did it stand the test of time?

I agree with the one person who posted here that there should be more extras on the dvd.  The episode from the LA Premiere that was on ""The Merv Griffin Show"" would be perfect, as would a comparison of the tv version...cleaning up some curse words, and different lines, to the original theatrical version.  The theatrical version of ""Mame,"" ""down under"" in Aust. is different from the US version.  It has different camera angles, different takes, etc.  All of this should be extras on the dvd.

I happen to prefer the Lucille Ball version, it just makes me laugh. Yes it is a bit cheesy; and perhaps Lucille Ball was a bit too old to play the part of Aunite Mame, perhaps they shouldn't have put so much Vaseline on the camera lenses while filming close ups of Lucille's face and perhaps her singing voice wasn't the best either.

284994,3,6300268853,"Amazingly, Broadway's first musical Mame, Angela Lansbury, going by a recent interview on Turner Classic Movies, is still grumbling over not getting the movie role. It's been more than three decades, Angie: get over it. Besides, Patrick Dennis, who created the character, hated Ms. Lansbury in the part (to be fair, he hated the musical, too); by the time Lucille Ball did the movie, Dennis was no longer writing and no longer cared, merely saying so many women had played Mame by then it no longer mattered.

Actually, in the long run, Angela Lansbury benefits. Not only does she get to be the victim that cruel Hollywood overlooked, she's spared the embarrassment of actually having done the movie. Do all the people who blame Lucy for the film's failure realize how bad the script was? That's what really did the movie in. Also, Lucy, unfortunately, had broken her leg the year before filming (if she seems in the movie like she's in pain, SHE IS); otherwise, she'd have been dancing up a storm. Okay, she should have given up the part. But Lucille Ball had a phobia about not working. And yes, the blurry close-ups are unsettling, but be fair: Rosalind Russell's close-ups in the overrated 1958 nonmusical movie are not exactly in razor-sharp focus, either. As for Angela Lansbury, not to be unkind, but with her thin lips, thick cheeks, pert nose, and sleepy Bette Davis eyes, glamorous close-ups might have been difficult.

Actually, Lucy's overaged, underinspired performance gives the movie such a bizarre quality that it almost succeeds despite itself. And there's still, of course, Bea Arthur's scene-stealing to enjoy. The other reviews posted here certainly indicate a strong interest in this peculiar, flawed, but strangely entertaining traffic accident of a film (the late Pauline Kael called it ""too terrible to be boring""), so why not put it out on DVD? And if and when that happens, please, Warner Home Video, use the great ""LucyMAME"" logo, or even the garish movie poster, for the cover artwork instead of the ugly Hillary Knight drawing of Lucy Mame (which looks more like Shirley MacLaine--who might not have been bad in the movie, come to think of it) that's on the VHS box and laser disc envelope.

Incidentally, I wonder if Ms. Lansbury, ungraciously trashing Lucy in her TCM interview with host Robert Osborne, knew that Osborne was one of Lucille Ball's proteges.",1172880000,2,2388,4.935323383084577
285045,5,6300268853,"Picture this: Lucy is at the end of her storied TV career, and had been dying to portray Mame ever since she saw Roz Russell do it on Broadway in the 1950s. This was her chance. Even though she had recently broken her leg in a ski accident, and was hesitant to take on a musical (she knew she was no Streisand, believe me), the studio would not cast anyone else in the role, including Angela Lansbury, who was still deemed an ""unknown"" to movie audiences. Lucy was the biggest star of the time that was even remotely ""box office"" to tackle the role of Mame. And so she did. She fired Madeline Kahn because she wanted the shleppy, fat Madeline of ""What's Up, Doc,"" and Kahn appeared at the first reading her normal, pretty self, insisting she needed time to get into the character. Lucy said, ""Get me the stage Gooch I just saw,"" meaning B'way original Jane Connell. Don't feel bad for MK -- she got paid off a handsome $50K for her troubles (a nice sum back then), much more than Connell made for actually playing the part.

Moving on...Lucy worked with choreographer Onna White like a champ, but there was only so much she could do to hide the stiffness she still coped with in her leg. That's why in several of the numbers, Lucy insn't so much ""dancing"" as being led around and twirled. Lucy could dance very well (see some of her older movies for proof), so it really killed her not being able to perform 100 percent. And her voice was, well, her own voice, lowered to an almost bass by all the screeching and smoking she did in her lifetime. Still, as someone pointed out, it kinda makes the whole thing more real.

Lucy must have been the one to insist on the heavy use of gauze or vaseline on the lens, to preserve her ""look"" for her fans -- the fans, see, still expected her to look like Lucy Ricardo. This may have been her one misstep -- she played the character so nicely, who cares if Mame is 55 or 65? In any case, photography has been used throughout film history to make female (and male) stars look perfect for screen audiences. Did you really want to see all the hair on Ginger Rogers' face, or view Claudette Colbert as the no-neck wonder she was, or wallow in the unapologetically masculine look of Barbara Stanwyck without makeup? Probably not. Movies are magic. Forgive Lucy her one bit of vanity, and watch the movie.

The movie itself was panned pretty much as an outdated vehicle for an outdated star. The attacks on Lucy were personal, and almost nothing like those reviews have appeared in print for any other star vehicle, before or since. Lucy took the reviews very personally, and was heartbroken. It indicated, to her, that the public just didn't want to see her as anyone else but the ""Lucy"" character. In truth, the movie is quite enjoyable, once you get past the performing child billed as Kirby Furlong. He has a voice, but the role really calls for a lovable kid actor, which he is not. The rest of the cast -- including Bea Arthur, Connell, Robert Preston, Bruce Davison, Don Porter and Audrey Christie -- is wonderful, the music hummable, and the costumes unbelievably fabulous.

I was so caught up in the move I forgot to do the change-over (switching projectors when reel ends on the current operating projector over to the full reel) this caused the audience to be some what upset however I recovered quickly and the show was back on the road.

forgettable. It has a beautiful production,but there are also some major problems. For one thing,it's at least twenty minutes too long. None of the choreography and musical numbers are

memorable. There are decent performances from Beatrice Arthur,

Robert Preston,and Jane Connell,but the others are terrible.

Paul Zindel's script and Gene Saks's direction are flabby and

unconvincing. Jerry Herman's score is delightful,but its presentation here is bland. The movie's biggest draw is also

its biggest problem:the leading role is badly miscast. Lucille

Ball is adequate AT BEST,but the role's requirements,script,and

direction ultmately defeat her efforts. And the fact that she has

no chemistry whatsoever with anyone else is a major problem(there were rumors of friction with Bea Arthur,and Lucy reportedly had Madeline Kahn fired from the role of Agnes,both of which she flatly denied).As good an actress as she was,Lucy

was simply not a musical comedy performer,and that's what the

role of Mame requires. In short,the film desperately needed Anglea Lansbury,but Warner Brothers didn't consider her a big

enough box office draw. Why didn't they try Julie Andrews,then?

Russell's original classic ""Auntie Mame"" instead.",1136851200,,1362,5.612745098039215

285098,5,6300268853,"This 1974 movie opened to generally negative reviews. Probably because most discerning movie-goers thought Angela Lansbury should've gotten the role, having been such a hit in the stage version.

Lucy was also about 15-20 years older than the role called for, which rubbed many traditionalists the wrong way.  In the context of today, when the range of appropriate and respectable behavior for women in their 50's and 60's has expanded considerably, we are probably much more forgiving of her audacity in tackling the role of a middle-aged woman(she was 62 during filming).  Unfortunately, she is filmed in such an extremely soft focus, you want to rub your eyes or squeegee your tv screen every other scene.

Otherwise, Lucy's beauty still shows - in 4 very different colored hair-dos, no less. Still tall, fit, broad-shouldered and leggy, Lucy carries her many sylish outfits terrifically, befitting the one-time fashion model from the 20's and 30's.

Another weakness is Lucy's singing voice, which is so low and lacking in vibrato, that in the more maudlin numbers, the effect can be pretty painful.  However, those numbers are very few, and more than overshadowed by the many upbeat sequences, including some really wonderful classics, for which her limited singing voice is perfectly well suited.  And, even at 62, and in recovery from a recently broken leg (during a skiing trip to Snowmass, Co in 1972), her dancing is remarkable skillful and agile (during her glamour days in the 1940's, practically every other role of hers entailed dancing.)

The comedy acting from just about everyone in the cast is first rate.  Lucy's deep, gravelly voice, so ill-equipped for singing, is perfectly suited to the dead-pan one liners and humorous dialogue that she delivers with the skill and aplomb of an old pro.  And, the physical comedy skills and timing for which she is legendary is on ample display.  In addition, many of the comedic performances in the supporting cast are hilarious, particularly Bea Arthur, Jane Connell, Robert Preston, Joyce Van Patten, and Audrey Christie.  It's the small role of Gloria Upson, played by Doria Cook, though, that never fails to crack me up.

Despite this movie's abysmal reputation, or maybe because of it, the quality and entertainment value will far exceed your expectations.  What seemed in 1974 an old-fashioned and dated vanity piece for a fading star, seems today like a musical and comedy extravaganza starring a timeless legend.",1131580800,21,2478,5.116625310173697
285099,5,6300268853,"This film has been considered a critical failure since the day it was released, and very unjustly so.  I happen to find MAME quite charming and a lot of fun.  The casting is super.  I do not think Lucy was miscast, although I can understand how one might arrive at that opinion... Lucy was 62 years old during filming, but was playing a character 15-20 years her junior.  Furthermore, one thing Lucy was NOT known for was being a singer, even though Mame is a musical role.  But that's just what I find all the more appealing about this film... context is the key word here.  Mame is not supposed to be Julie Andrews or Kathryn Grayson (although there are any number of musical actresses who would have made a fine Mame); a lower more raspy voice is more suited to the character.  While no one will ever be able to top Rosalind Russell from the earlier nonmusical play and its 1958 film adaptation AUNTIE MAME, or Angela Lansbury from the Broadway cast of the musical, Lucy is in there trying her darndest and in my opinion pulls it off rather well.  Playing Mame at 62 years old was no easy task I'm sure.  Lucy really seems to be enjoying herself--just watch her during the ""Mame"" number...she almost seems to glow.

The supporting cast are outstanding.  Bea Arthur is THE best Vera Charles, hands down.  Seeing her and Lucy in ""Bosom Buddies"" is classic--whether or not they got along off camera is totally irrelavent.  Robert Preston was born to play Beau, and Jane Connell reprises her role of Agnes Gooch, which she had played on Broadway.  (Did you know she was nearly 50 in this film?)

MAME has been available on VHS for years, though it is now out of print, but still not really that hard to track down if you play your cards right.  Unfortunately the VHS, while acceptable, is full frame (aka ""pan-n-scan"") and we really miss a lot by not having it in widescreen.  The AUNTIE MAME DVD features the trailer for this film, in widescreen, and even that is fabulous.

This filmization of the hit Broadway musical starring Angela Lansbury was almost universally panned when it was initially released in 1974, but I've suffered through far worse.

Lucille Ball stepped into Angela Lansbury's shoes for the screen translation. Many have complained that Miss Ball was too old for her role and her singing talent (or lack of) has been severely attacked as well. Perhaps there is something to these complaints, but Miss Ball seems to be enjoying herself so much that it really doesn't matter. Whether she is completely right for the part or not, she still comes off as a star, and a damn bright one. Bea Arthur is splendid recreating her Tony-winning role as Mame's best friend Vera Charles; her ""Bosom Buddy"" number with Lucy is a definite highlight.

I was very pleased with the Rosalind Russell version.  She does an excellent job playing the part of Auntie Mame.  The entire 1958 version is hilarious, and with the exception of the hydraulic furniture scene, stays true to the book.

However, this Lucille version is a bomb if I've ever seen one.  Since when is Agnes Gooch Patrick's nanny?  She was Mame's first secretary until her pregnancy.  Pegeen was changed completely.  Lucille Ball was far past her prime to star in this part.  To top it off, the cheesiness of turning a story like this into a musical was beyond description!

Ball was in RKO and MGM musicals in the 30's and 40's where she played sassy and brassy.  Seeing her play something slightly softer and more vulnerable is a welcome change.
Comparisons to the Rosalind Russell version puzzle me; this one is a musical, that one is not.  A musical introduces a different nuance to a story and character which will result in a slightly different interpretation. Grace Kelly in ""High Society"" was not Katherine Hepburn in ""The Philadelphia Story"", but it would have been somewhat shocking to see Cary Grant break out into song about Kate.  Seeing Bing Crosby do it about Grace made sense.
Even if you don't like Ball's performance, it's only a minor flaw in what is a great package:  clever songs, scenery-chewing Vera, hilarious Gooch, and some truly funny lines.

And of course, her singing limitations are well documented (Heck, the reason Ricky never let Lucy into his acts on I Love Lucy was because his wife was completely tonedeaf!) Trouper that she is, Lucy does her best with the role, and must be commended for the effort. Luckily, she has a quality supporting cast to fall back on. The hysterical Beatrice Arthur (why isn't this brilliant television performer in more movies!) is a riot as Vera Charles.

I enjoyed ""The Lucy Show,"" and watched also ""Here's Lucy,"" which was inferior to its predecessor. Her last tv series, ""Life With Lucy,"" was, sad to say, the nadir of this great star's career.

 As for the movie version of ""Mame,"" it's a fun look at a great musical that could have been improved with a better choice for the starring role. Lucy was too old, and she never was a great singer to begin with. However, she gave it her best shot and it's fun to see her in her extravagant costumes and trying hard in all the numbers, especially ""It's Today,""""Bosom Buddies,"" and, of course, the title song. I don't think the film is the travesty that some make it out to be. Just look at Barbra Streisand in Jerry Herman's ""Hello, Dolly!"" That movie has gotten better with time (even though I always loved it), and I believe even Jerry Herman has said it has grown on him. (Now what's happening with the tv version of ""Mame"" with Cher? That should be interesting!)

Anyway, at least this movie contains Bea Arthur's performance and the wonderful Jane Connell's stage turn too. (It would have been interesting to see the late Madeline Kahn as Agnes Gooch. She was originally cast, but it didn't work out. Did you know that?) Hats off to the wonderful Robert Preston, who lit up the screen with his beautiful voice. (Of course, see him in ""The Music Man"" and ""Victor/Victoria."")

I have a question: How come Ito and Agnes never age in the movie, but everyone else seems to have aged a bit? At least ten years pass from the time young Patrick is little until the time he becomes an adult at the end of the film.

First on my (and, it seems, everyone's agenda) is Lucille Ball.  OK.  I can't say that they should've picked a different Mame, because ""they"" couldn't.  As another reviewer pointed out, Lucy bought the rights to this terribley fuzzy and joke of a movie.  Lucy.  Let's look at the facts on Lucy.  Lucille Ball is known around the world as a wonderfully exuberent and bite the bullet TV comedien.  So what is she doing playing this witty and glamorous aunt?  Not to mention that her singing could never make it on any stage (as I'm sure they jacked up the mikes for 62 year old Miss Ball).
And the porker they have playing Patrick (who by the way cannot sing a note) is not in any essence an open and exuberent Patrick Dennis, except for his blonde locks.
And let's talk ceoreography.  Onna White originally ceoreographed the 1966 stage version of ""Mame"" and I'm sure he had a lot more to work with.  I'm sure he had to work around Lucy's bad hips, but it's been done before.  So why does this dancing stink?  In Sweet Charity and Cabaret there's a dazzling amount of wonderful and original dancing.  So why didn't this work for Mame?  Yes, the dancers do a witty little butt slap and a basic charelston move.  But please.  Lucille could've at least had a decent Hollywood ceoreographer do the job.
And the costumes might be wonderful, but not Mame.  Where are the ostrich feathers and the diamonds.  The costumer even sticks Mame in a melencholy and plain black mourning gown during ""Open a New Window""
Musical numbers?  Joke.  They haxed the wonderful loud instruments, and cut the lovely instrumental solo music for a slow and soft elevator soundtrack.
Those are the out standing bads, leaving out so many.  All in all this movie is what many reviewers would call it horrible, but let's look at the few nice things about this apalling movie.
First, the betrayel of Agnes Gooch is done ""cute"" by the original actress who had the part in 1966.  But she really can't compare to what Madeline Kahn (my favorite film comedianess) could've done with the role (our dear Madeline was hauked by Miss Ball.  I wonder why?).  Believe it or not this cute Agnes was one of the goods.
But basically the only remotely good thing about this movie is the wonderfully funny potrayel of Mame's best friend, a stage vamp, by Miss Bea Arthur.  Her hillarious alcoholic and snobbish spoofing across the screen is one not to be missed (but wait for this movie to be on TV before you see it, because what moron would spend decent money on this)?
This version of the escapades of Auntie Mame Dennis makes me ask, where's the outrageosness, where's the bohemian qualities, and most of all, where's Angela Lansbury?
Surprisingly enough, this terrible film is actually taken from a superbly and glamorously written book under the title Auntie Mame, which has a fabulous film version starring the enchanting Rosalind Russel.

Lucy is as ill-suited for the role as everyone has noted, with the soft-focus producing cruel giggles at every close-up. The Young Patrick actor is fairly weak (but of course, I'm comparing him to my own son!). Bea Arthur OWNS the role of Vera. The various supporting actors are good if not great.
With some Broadway musicals that have been made into movies, the transition is an improvement, from a pure-entertainment standpoint. Alas, that's not the case here. It would have been great if Angela Lansbury could have been cast.",1024444800,4,914,4.828025477707007

The movie is incredibly funny.  One of the best moments is when Mame fails as The Man in the Moon.  Admittedly, the movie drags slightly in the second half, but that could be because you know that Patrick's girlfriend just shouldn't be his girlfriend.

285197,3,6300268853,"In Lucille Ball's swan song for the big screen, she plays the eccentric, unpredictable Mame Dennis. Like countless others, I'm a devout Lucy fan, so I'm going to be truthfully diplomatic about this one. With such a wonderful literary heritage, the movie MAME should have been a winner. Had Lucy tackled this plum role about fifteen years earlier, she'd have been sensational! By this time she was 62 and had just recovered from her infamous skiing accident. She also bowed out from TV after 23 years. Truthfully, after watching countless episodes of I LOVE LUCY and witnessing so many sparkling performances from Ms Ball, her acting technique by this time seemed (in comparison) rather self-conscious, insincere, tired and flat: clearly the Lucy of 1974 was not the one of 1954 but it wasn't just time itself that was to blame - producers would have wise at this point in her career to have given her a starring role in a sitcom likened to the GOLDEN GIRLS where she could be comfortable acting her age, being funny in a role written and tailor made to suit her needs (she would have been great, but I think she worried whether the public would accept her that way - instead she was doomed to fail in the uninspired LIFE WITH LUCY which any[one] could see wasn't worthy of this great lady's talent. It was an insult and she deserved a much better, thought-out format which suited her age and stature) I thought Jane Connell was too old for Agnes Gootch. Bea Arthur wasn't bad as Vera Charles and Robert Preston was fine as Beauregard. Paul Novak took Mae West to see the movie and she decided that there was something wrong with the film-(literally) The screens they used to give Lucille a soft-focus looked funny to theatregoers in 1974. Lucy was eternally grateful for Onna White (the choreographer) for her patience and no-nonsense approach. Theadora Van Runkle's costumes for Lucy were interesting. It has been noted over and over that Lucy's rather harsh voice is ludicrous - Ball badly needed SOMEONE who could professionally train/save her ""naturally affected"" duck-like voice! In later years Lucy's voice was practically a monotone which greatly hampered her performances. (Even as Lucy Ricardo, Lucy used a higher pitch to give Ms Ricardo a more youthful, lovable personna) Critics of the day were especially cheeky to Lucy in their reviews: For example, Pauline Kael wrote - ""Too terrible to be boring; you can get fixated wondering exactly what Lucille Ball thought she was doing!"". Since comedy was Lucy's forte, much was done to bring slapstick, instead of quick-witted comedy into the proceedings. Lucy strained to do her best with the fox hunt and get-rid-of-the-Upsons sequence, as well as her moments bringing disaster to the stage operetta and chaos to Macy's department store. Ed Sullavan once remarked that of all the entertainers which guested on his show, unquestionably, the most beloved was Lucille Ball. Let me be the first to admit that I'm a dyed-in-the-wool fan of I LOVE LUCY. I think it was the funniest sitcom in the history of television and that Lucy was dynamic in her playing of Lucy Ricardo. It's almost eerie when you watch LaBall's performances in that show---you can't help but to notice that she was actually a GREAT actress (Lucy was a serious person -her moon was in Capricorn- and in real life didn't ""think funny"". THE LUCY SHOW and especially (and ironically) HERE'S LUCY dates badly. Amazingly, in I LOVE LUCY, Ball's acting is timeless---she's still as funny to watch as she was in 1952; she could be called the Bette Davis of comediennes!! Do you know that department stores had to change their hours because they did such lousy business during the show? In big cities, the water department noted that MUCH less water was used between 9-9:30 on Monday nights! Lucy's attractiveness, timing, grace, vigourous energy, delivery, facial expressions, voices etc. were unequaled by anyone--the Lucille Ball of the 1950's was simply a DYNAMIC star in every sense of the word! I have come to think that because I'm such a devotee of the beloved series, I probably (subconsciously) compare the rest of her work with it.",998438400,,4158,4.882602545968883

285199,4,6300268853,"1974's ""Mame"" starring Lucille Ball, is without a doubt, one of the most controversial films ever made. Produced at a time when musicals had already moved way out of fashion with the movie going public, ""Mame"" dared to be all the things that a classic, big movie musical had always been. Big, splashy, and over the top. At the time it actually seemed more like a film lifted out of the 1940's rather than one filmed in the ""self aware seventies."" And to top it all off, Warner Brothers had built the entire production around 63 year old Lucille Ball, who could not sing or dance. The perfect set-up for a disaster right?
Wrong! It's taken nearly 30 years, but now with the cushion of time to dim the harsh criticism that was heaped on this film when it first appeared in theatres, ""Mame"" actually comes across today as a whimsically loveable musical.  And Lucille Ball makes the perfect Mame Dennis, warm and witty, with a heart made of gold but bitchy and protective when necessary. I think Lucy did a marvelous job breathing life into this beloved character. The great supporting cast is to be commended as well. Bea Arthur is wonderful as Mame's best friend Vera Charles.
The musical numbers are lavish, with sets and costumes that are perfect for the period, and even though Lucy's singing will not win any awards, she sounds just the way a woman like Mame would sound. It's great fun watching this beloved actress cavort through this lively tale, singing and dancing for all she's worth all decked out in those killer gowns, and the wonderful rainbow of different colored wigs.
The great part about watching this on the smaller screen is that the much-ballyhooed gauze filtered camera lens, used as a device to soften Lucy's age at the time, becomes a non-factor in this format, because the smaller picture appears much sharper to the eye.
Yes it is a fact that ""Mame"" was a box office disaster, and it is also true that the critics piled on with hateful reviews, which hurt Lucille Ball personally. But if you've never seen this wonderful film, or it's been years since you've seen it, I suggest you get a copy, gather the family around the set, pop up some popcorn and prepare yourself for a great treat. The years have been much kinder to ""Mame"" than the critics. And Lucy will surely ""coax the blues right out of your heart.""

285222,5,6300268853,"""Mame"", based on the 1966 Broadway smash about the adventures of a madcap grande dame auntie and her hapless nephew Patrick, was revitalized for this glorious 1974 movie adaptation. Starring a sixty-three-year-old Lucille Ball, the film became controversial through the years because of Ball's ""inadequacy"" to play the role and that Angela Lansbury, who had immortalized the title role in the musical ""Mame"", should have played the role. Perhaps so. Who knows, the film probably would have benefited greatly from Lansbury's classic performance. But Lucille Ball triumphs in the role of Mame, and projects an infectious flamboyance with such verve and joy and she also projects a genuine tenderness and warmth through the role. And yes, Ball is by no means a singer, but again, there is so much warmth shining through Jerry Herman's classic ""Mame"" score, with Ball's lower-key, rueful singing. Ball is even quite glamorous in the film, sometimes almost resembling a mature Vivien Leigh early in the film. And there is the classic ""Lucy"" humor in the role, which will delight Ball's ""I Love Lucy"" fans and filmgoers. No question about it: Lansbury will always be the ultimate musical ""Mame"",  but no question about it: Ball is a triumph in the role,and if she had to leave films, she left on a glorious note.
Aside from controversy surrounding the Ball performance, the film is nothing short of a delight. Jerry Herman's ""Mame"" score includes such favorite classics as ""It's Today"", ""We Need A Little Christmas"", ""If He Walked Into My Life"", and of course, the wonderful title tune, ""Mame"", stunningly photographed, choreographed, and sung by a crowd of Southerners in reverence of Mame.
Casting is also inspired. Beatrice Arthur reprises her Tony-winning role as Mame's gin-soaked, haughty actress best friend, Vera Charles, and Robert Preston scores as Mame's Southern husband Beauregard Burnside, and Jane Connell is hilarious as the befuddled nanny Agnes Gooch.
The film is also full of many, many golden scenes: ""Mame""'s opening party sequence, Mame's disastrous stage debut, Mame's whirlwind fox hunt, Mame's round-the-world honeymoon, Mame meeting the parents of Patrick's uppity girlfriend, and Mame leading Patrick's little boy to new adventures at film's end.
Ball also recruited many of the original Broadway performers and technicians for the film, with Beatrice Arthur's performance and Onna White's choreography and Gene Saks's direction. It was a wonderful decision, because this gives the film much of the flavor of the Broadway show. So, in the final analysis, ""Mame"" is indeed, for all the messiness and controversy, a truly wonderful gem of a movie musical, and one that should be treasured by movie audiences for a very long time.",978739200,17,2748,5.2312925170068025
285223,3,6300268853,"As a remake of the great Rosalind Russell film AUNTIE MAME(1958), how does this rate in comparison? Hmmmh... Not too good. But if you are a Lucy lover, and can view it as an entirely different picture, you should do just fine. Miss Ball was 63 and not in the best of health when this project was saddled onto her all too slender shoulders. But, being the great and professional actress that she was, she decided that the show must go on and she played the role to the best of her ability. Many have made unkind remarks regarding Miss Ball's singing in this film. Actually, that's the very least of the film's problems. The central problem, which has always been a problem for Hollywood, is the fact that this is a filmization of a Broadway play. Almost everytime(though there are exceptions) that Hollywood tries to adapt a hit stage play, something gets lost in the translation, and MAME is certainly no exception. However, there are some marvellously splendid sequences. These moments are supplied mostly by the great Bea Arthur as Mame's eccentric gal pal, Vera Charles. Arthur wonderfully recreates her Tony Award-winning stage role and easily walks away with the picture. In fact, the film is worth seeing for her scenes only. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the film has some bright, and occasionally charming moments too, but in order to fully appreciate them, you almost have to view the picture from a camp perspective.

It was also in  hte second half that a lot of the non-singing roles appeared (like the  hilarius Upson's) adding a great deal of charm to the movie.  ""If He  Walked Into My Life"" was profoundly moving, and ""Bosom  Buddies"" was rather charming.  From ""My best Girl"" on,  _Mame_ was a good movie.  It really is a shame that by that point in the  movie most people had lost interest as a result of the poor opening.

I  still find it remarkable that Lucille Ball even finished the picture.  She  was in so much pain during the making of ""MAME"".  I mean think  about it... how many 64 year old women do any of you know that can break  their leg and then make a big budget Hollywood film?
It's such a shame  that reviewers (who are miserable human beings anyway) just can't say why  they don't like a film without having to launch personal attacks against  the actors.

Other than the fact that my tv screen isn't as large as the average theater's...after  26 years the film still holds up incredibly well.
At the time, fans of  Angela Lansbury felt slighted.  Lucy was entering an age and a time in her  career when some were more inclined to laugh at her...than with her.
Her  performance (in her early to mid-60's) is incredible.  Note how high she  kicks relative to the chorus line in the ""Mame"" number.  She  broke her leg during the filming...yet still completed all her own dance  steps, and even upgraded some of the choreography.
Bea Arthur, Jane  Connell and Robert Preston make this cast and production a real pleasure to  watch.
Beating on Lucy and her supposed ""limited range"" vocally  and otherwise became quite fashionable in the ""Here's Lucy""  era...
Maybe she stayed on TV too long instead of leaving at the  top...maybe her act in it's final days became too 'one note.'
Certainly  not the case with this film if you're paying attention, or even understand  what a 'great musical' really can be.

Mame Dennis would exclaim over the great debate raging at Amazon.com over this movie.(I thought Last Tango In Paris was the most controversial film of 1973!)I have enjoyed Auntie Mame as a novel,  non-musical movie version of the stage translation of '56 AND the 1973 film  adaptation of the '66 Broadway show. Regrettably I have yet to see it on  stage though I'm sure Rosalind Russell and Angela Lansbury were both great  in their respective portrayals. The 1958 movie is well done with marvellous  performances ( Russell,Coral Browne,Peggy Cass) but has the air of a filmed  stage play. Mortan daCosta's ""iris fade-outs"" seem to work better  in his film of THE MUSIC MAN, another show he directed on both stage and  screen.  The 1973 version (savaged by critics in an era when musicals  of this ilk were seen as passe and many good musical films died critically  and financially) has always entertained me and the many others I have  screened it to over the years on 16mm,video and laserdisc. Like other films  I enjoy, it is not without its flaws. I wish the soft-focussing of Lucille  Ball's close-ups was a little less extreme and despite her game efforts to  sing, the songs would have benefitted from a voice double such as Lisa Kirk  (who assisted Rosalind Russell so well in GYPSY).At the time I heard a  rumour that she was being considered for this role but ultimately vetoed.  Nonethless Lucy is both funny and warm in this part and comes across  much younger than her 62 years. Beatrice Arthur (almost replaced by Bette  Davis) is brilliant,in fact I can't think of too many other films with such  an array of talented character actors: Jane Connell(a replacement for  Madeline Kahn,who would have been great too),Audrey Christie(from  CAROUSEL),Doria Cook(a riot as Gloria),Joyce Van Patten,Lucille Benson as  Mother Burnside etc. Robert Preston is great as Beau and the fact that his  death is handled seriously rather than comically (as in the non-musical  versions) is a plus.  Jerry Herman's score is always a pleasure to  hear (superior to HELLO DOLLY! in my opinion) and the sets,  costumes,Panavision cinematography and editing are all striking(filters  notwithstanding). The title sequence with Warners' '30's clips is to me one  of the most brilliant on film. Gene Saks handles the material as  effectively as circumstances allowed and the film certainly never drags.  Despite the critical tirade the film did well in certain cities  (Melbourne for one) and Ball and Arthur were both nominated for Golden  Globes. There are other enjoyable musicals with less than perfect vocal  performances and styles which may have dated- this is one that I have  returned to more than most since seeing it on its initial release. Roz may  have been the best Mame Dennis, but for me, the musical film version is  more cinematic and entertaining overall.

I saw  Angela Lansbury do a revival of ""MAME"" on Broadway in 1982 and it  was pretty good but not magical by any means.  Seeing Tyne Daly do  ""GYPSY"" on Broadway was magical, believe me.... anyway I just  wanted to say that Lucy is very good in this picture and for the life of me  I just can't understand the very personal attacks that are made on Lucille  Ball for her acting and singing.

Critiquing a film is good but crucifying it is very  wrong.  Give ""MAME"" a chance folks... who knows you just might  like it.",948240000,2,1073,4.350253807106599
285264,2,6300268853,"Okay, I know there are many people out there who love this movie, so I will try to respect their opinion.  But I just really did not like Lucy in this movie.  I completely agree with Jarod Kirkland's review; she was great  on TV but too old, tired, flat, self-concious, and insincere, among other  things, to be even average here.  Yes, Lucy couldn't sing if her life  depended on it, but I don't necessarily need a good singer to enjoy a  musical on film.  I loved the film versions of Camelot, Gypsy, and My Fair  Lady, because even though the stars couldn't sing, they could ACT, and all  gave great acting performances.  Therefore, I was not the least bit  dissapointed.  Here, however, Lucy gives no indication that she was ever a  hilarious physical comedy genius or a versatile actress.  She's just plain  bad, and as others have noted, it's really hard to like her, and you gotta  love Mame for the story to work. I loved Rosalind Russell in the film of  Auntie Mame and Angela Lansbury in the cast album of the Broadway musical.  (Alas, I wasn't alive to see it performed!)  But I just couldn't love Lucy  here, for the reasons Jarod noted, and for the reason that she really did  not act like a funny, warm, fun-loving, vibrant person, the very essence of  what the character of Mame Dennis is.  She was really cold and even snobby.  She made Mame a diva of the worst kind, and Mame ain't no diva, of the  best or worst kind.
Despite the best efforts of Bea Arthur, the consumate  professional and the source of the movie's few laughs as Vera Charles, and  Robert Preston, about the only good singer in the film as Beau, and the  presence of Jerry Herman's great score, or what was left of it after Lucy  was done with it, this film ends up being a real embarrassment.  Lucy is  miscast, Gene Saks didn't direct it very well, the script was awful, and  the cinemetography and editing were just plain insane.  All the fans of  this movie ought to go out and rent Auntie Mame and the CD of the Broadway  cast album.  Then, they just might think twice about this one.  If not,  then oh, well.",947808000,6,2099,4.409448818897638
285265,5,6300268853,"I think I have reviewed this picture so much here that you might get sick of reading my name... however, I really think that if you love to have fun watching a movie then ""MAME"" will make you smile more than a few  times.  Lucille Ball plays Mame Dennis differently than Roz Russell did in  ""Auntie Mame"" but that is why it's so good.  Lucy brings her own  charm and warmth to the character of Mame that Russell sometimes  characterizes in her portrayal a little too much.  I give up on mentioning  that Lucy's singing or croaking to some of you really doesn't bother me and  infact I think it's nice because it is Lucy.  The woman never pretended to  be a singer and sometimes you have to look behind the vocals of a song and  look into the character singing and whats going on in the story.  Russell  sure couldn't sing in ""GYPSY"" and neither could Rex Harrison in  ""MY FAIR LADY"" so who cares if the performer is endearing to the  viewer.  Lucy does a wonderful job in the film and her scenes with Patrick  are touching.  She also has some great moments when she finds out that the  Upsons are enormous bigots.  Bea Arthur is absolutely fantastic in this  film.  She has the best lines and the perfect comic timing and delivery.  When Lucy and Bea are onscreen together it is pure magic.  There are some  that can knock this film for all its faults, and it does have many, till  they are blue in the face but for me ""MAME"" is a really  entertaining and wonderful film.",947462400,2,1471,4.328413284132841
285266,2,6300268853,"Too terrible to be boring, you can fixated watching this wondering exactly what Lucille Ball thought she was doing. When that sound comes out-it's something between a bark and a quaver-does she really think she's singing?  When she throws up her arms in their giant red bat sleeves and yells  ""Listen, everybody""! does she really think she's a fun person?  Lucille Ball was a genius in her television series but she was too old, too  basso in the voice & stringy in the legs to pull off Mame. Lucy at this  point in her career hadn't the gregarious personality (a'la Lanbury or  Russell) that is neccesary in the playing of this character; her  performance seems tired, flat, self-conscious and insincere. Desi among  others begged Lucy not to play this role, but she wouldn't listen (just as  she skied and broke her leg at 62) I love Lucy, too, but this has got to  go!",947462400,13,871,4.597402597402597

I do not think Lucy is so hideous -- she certainly retains her charm and humor throughout, but those  vocals .... However, the delicious Bea Arthur more than compensates, and  she steals  virtually every scene with her Vera Charles, who is the model  for drag queens everywhere.  Her spot-on line readings, particularly in the  well-produced Man on the Moon sequence, is fresh and funny even today.  The  sumptuous production values, Vaseline-covered lens for Lucy not  withstanding, deserve mention, as does Robert Preston, who is always  effervescent.

285288,3,6300268853,"I've read all the prior reviews and it seems people either love or hate this movie! Lucille Ball was absolute DYNAMITE as Lucy Ricardo but as Mame Dennis, she was just too old and tired to pull it off! Rosalind Russell was  ten years younger that Lucy's 62 when she played the part so successfully  in 1958.(Had Lucy tried this 15 years earlier,she'd probably have been  terrific!) I agree with an other reviewer that by this time, her  grace,timing and vigor had pretty much vanished. NOBODY Loves Lucy better  than I do and over the years she's become a national monument. The only  problem is that in this film she performs like one!(and the gauzey look of  the film itself is a reminder of Lucy's age; it's obvious she didn't want  her wrinkled face highlighted in her close-ups)",944524800,4,783,4.6231884057971016

Her  upbeat personality adds so much to this film and her connection with little  Patrick is perfect. And as for her singing...THIS WAS NOT A BROADWAY SHOW!  This is the screen adaptation and that quality is not expected. Don't get  me wrong,she did a terrific job anyways. And for those of you who are  expecting to see the traditional ""Lucy"" you can find it. She does  a great job of blending a little comedy into the film. I highly recomend  purchasing this video!

285293,1,6300268853,"Based on word-of-mouth and on the original Broadway cast album, Mame is a pretty good musical, if not a great one.  Based on her reputation and on  her various TV series, Lucille Ball was definitly a great comedienne.  But  when they collided together with a huge thud in this colossal misfire of a  movie, neither one came out looking good at all.  The fact that there's a  large group of people out there that actually likes this movie is almost  shocking and more than a little disturbing.  All those who ply the film  with overzealous praise seem to be diehard Lucy fans, who refuse to admit  that she was capable of doing anything wrong.  Folks, the woman was a human  being, not a god.  She made mistakes, just like the rest of us.
All the  people working behind the scenes on this film seem to not have had a firm  grasp on what they were doing.  Gene Saks directed the original Broadway  musical to great success, but in his directon of the film he is dangerously  unsteady.  He never keeps the film going in a steady direction for long,  always jerking it somewhere else, usually very suddenly and at stupidly  inoppurtune moments.  He's aided immeasurably (NOT a compliment) by the  editing, with its never-ending use of quick cuts.  (A slow dissolve or a  fadeout would have been welcome once in a while!)  Paul Zindel's screenplay  is chock-full of embarrassing lines.  It's faithful to the story of Auntie  Mame, but has none of the hialrious or touching moments of that  film.
With such chaos behind the scenes, is it a wonder no one onscreen  comes off looking good?  The one who comes off looking best is Bea Arthur,  who is the REAL person that gives it her all in trying to do something with  the pathetic material.  Her low-key, barbed approach to the song  ""Bosom Buddies"" is what saves it.  She succeeds okay in doing  something with the material, and is a breath of fresh air, which is why she  seems to be underused.  She isn't on for a good chunk of time, and without  her, the film sags even slower than usual.  Robert Preston's appearence and  his songs pick up the pace, but he hardly does anything before he's killed  off.  Jane Connell truly is wasted, because she doesn't do anything until  the end of the film, and all she does is show us how ridiculously bad she  looks in that red dress and how pathetic her number comes off as being.  (Since most of the songs came off looking bad, it really isn't her  fault.)
And now I must come to Lucille Ball's portrayal of Mame.  First  of all, she just isn't convincing as the classy-yet-wacky, vibrant socilite  with an unquenchable zest for life.  Sorry, folks, but I found no class or  grace in Lucy's portryal, and because she has no energy at all, she can't  portray the vibrnacy and the zest for life convincingly, either.  Yes, she  was 62 and had broken her leg, etc., but these characteristics define Mame.  Coudln't she have done something to inject energy into her performance,  take some medicine, do an exercise regimen, ANYTHING?  It would've helped,  but she didn't do it.  Second, she just was not funny.  The one-liners,  delivered to perfection by Roz Russell, weren't there.  Well, that's really  the script's fault, but it doesn't help that Lucy's comic timing is way  off.  And why does everyone think the fox hunt scene was funny?  All Lucy  did was sit on the horse, that's it.  Didn't look that scared, didn't  scream or wave her arms; she just sat there.  The rest was long shots of a  stuntwoman looking very calm and comfortable on a supposedly mad horse.  And we're supposed to be happy when Mame emerges from this unscathed?  Come  on!  In her Lucy Ricardo days, she could've done something hilarious with  this, but those days were far behind her by this time.  As for her  supposedly touching moments, they all consist of her realtionship to her  nephew Patrick, whcih provided the heart of Auntie Mame and hopefully of  the stage musical, too.  But they don't work here, because Lucy gets  uncomfortable around young Kirby Furlong and gets mad at older Bruce  Davison.  Yes, Furlong is an annoying little baby who isn't at all wise  beyond his years, as Auntie Mame's Patrick was, and Davison is an  all-too-convincing snob, but couldn't Lucy have tried to at least look like  she liked them?  Well, she didn't, so that ruins the touching moments, too.  And finally,.... I know this issue has been beaten to death, but in a  picture with so many problems, you can't ignore the problem of Lucy's  singing skills.  She slows the picture (and Jerry Herman's energetic,  electric score) down to a crawl whenever she starts heaving lyrics out from  the very depths of her throat, ooonnneee wwoorrdd aaaaatttt aaaaa  ttttiiiimmmeee.  And since she has to do this for five or six songs, the  picture moves along at a crawl for much of the way.  The part of the song  ""It's Today"" that Lucy doesn't sing, as well as the song  ""Mame,"" which she doesn't sing at all, and the song ""Bosom  Buddies,"" are memorable, but that's because they're fast-paced and  energized.  You can't stop yourself from groaning whenever Lucy starts  singing; it's nearly impossible.
I think I've made my point, that the  movie was awful and Lucy was awful in it.  I do feel sorry for her when I  hear the movie was painful for her to make and that she invested so much of  her own money into this (God only knows how much she lost), but I just  can't give her a good grade on sympathy alone.  Now that I think about it,  perhaps she did do rigorous workouts to prepare for the movie, and THEY'RE  what ruined her energy and her ability to perform, but I still stand by  what I said.  It's what's onscreen that really matters, and what's onscreen  is pathetic and very sad.  All the fans of this picture say we need to  watch it with an open mind?  Why don't YOU watch it with an open mind and  the willingness to believe that Lucy was only human and could make a  mistake.  Then, watch Auntie Mame and listen to the Broadway soundtrack  with the willingness to believe that Roz Russell and Angela Lansbury could  play Mame a helluva lot better than Lucy.  Go back to Lucy's old movies and  TV series, things in which she was actually GOOD at, and abandon this  movie.  I promise, if you do it, you won't regret it.",941068800,20,6288,4.5477477477477475

Those of you who love Lucy, you won't here.....those of you who review this with 5 stars obviously have  no idea what the live stage musical was like, I saw it. I also read  composer Jerry Herman's book, who pleaded with Warner to cast Angela  Lansbury, and after that had to EDIT songs that Lucy sang-in one case a  single note that she couldn't sing!  Bea Arthur is the treat here, and the  complete score, except for the title song, has been destroyed with people  who don't know musical theatre and film, and have absolutely no singing  voice whatsoever. I am very excited about the tv remake going into  production with Streisand producing. I think we may finally have a GOOD  version on film of this fabulous musical.

Some people criticised it because Lucy didn't dance much.  You go out and break your  leg skiing, and then, one year later, at sixty-three, you do a movie, and  then we'll talk. Lucille Ball was wonderful as Mame.  She really brought  the character to life.  Some say she was too much Lucy Ricardo.  If you  would ever read the book, Mame was madcap.  Lucy portrayed her that way.  Besides, would we really have Mame (or Lucy, for that matter) any other  way?  For years I put off watching this movie because I figured it would  be terrible.

No, ""Mame"" is NOT better than ""Auntie Mame"" but  it's an interesting addendum.  BLANTANT ANACHRONISM: In ""Mame"",  when Mame & her gang are getting ready to go out to dinner with Beau  (aka Robert Preston), Mame mentions that she never thought Santa Claus  would look so much like Rhett Butler.
