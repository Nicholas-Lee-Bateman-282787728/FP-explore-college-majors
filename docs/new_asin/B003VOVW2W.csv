4209746,5,B003VOVW2W,"Purchased as a gift for 6-year-old greatniece as she is going as a vampire this year for Halloween.  She loves it and there are 26 episodes to keep her occupied.  Great price and arrived earlier than expected from Amazon.
Thanks.",1314576000,5,229,4.7
4209747,5,B003VOVW2W,"My daughter requested this set after seeing one episode on another DVD she had. It came as a bonus and she is hooked! We received the set on Feb 5th and she has watched it everyday since it showed up!! It's a really cute show, a girl and her friends save the town from various monsters, aliens, etc. They all have clever alter egos to help them get the job done. Very imaginative and fun. My daughter is 7 years old and I would recommend this show to anyone. We can't wait for season 2!!",1299542400,7,487,4.136842105263158

4209761,5,B003VOVW2W,Mona is a great little movie for a small child.  My Grandaughter loves this movie.  She is a big Mona fan.  But this particular movie will entertain a child for a long while. I definitely recommend this movie for young children.  Little girls will be intrigued by all these episodes shown. This is not a scary movie.  Mona just thinks she's a vampire.  It's all in fun.  Very cute.,1376784000,,381,4.434782608695652
4209762,5,B003VOVW2W,She watches it all the time. It's nice because this show doesn't air in our area.  Now if I could only convince her not to introduce herself to others as Mona the Vampire!,1373673600,,171,4.181818181818182
4209763,5,B003VOVW2W,Mona is awesome!  My daughter loves it.  I recommend for all children and adults.  Excellent imagination involved in this show.,1363651200,,127,5.25
4209764,5,B003VOVW2W,"Just the right amount of silliness, but still is able to pass along a good story that young and old can watch.",1358553600,,110,4.045454545454546
4209765,5,B003VOVW2W,"My daughter is 3. We had a hard time making childrens cartoons appealing for her, so I ventured out and bought the Bunch of Munsch dvd at the store hoping it would interest her as she liked 'Busy Town.' It was a hit but not only for the movie, but for the fact in the previews there was a cute little girl in a vampire costume that has a very CATCHY theme song. My little girl had to have it, so I bought her the first series of Mona the Vampire for Christmas. Not only is it intellectually stimulating, fun, and helps problem solve, but it totally enhances the imagination. I recommend this for all the parents out there that have children that bore easy to the mundane nature of tv broadcasted childrens cartoons.",1357257600,,715,4.343283582089552
4209766,5,B003VOVW2W,I was so glad when I found this. My girls watched an episode of Mona the Vampire on one of their My Little Pony dvds and my 4 yr old loved it. This has alot of episodes on it so they get a variety. If your child likes Mona I would highly recommend getting this.,1351728000,,261,3.7636363636363637
4209767,5,B003VOVW2W,"My two boys, aged 5 & 3 are completely hooked and like the other reviewers children, have watched it every day for months now.
It's like a slightly less scary Scooby Doo (although still scary enough to keep them engrossed).
The story centers around three friends (one is a boy) who live imaginary realities, usually misinterpreting the situations as around them as supernatural while inadvertently ""solving"" or ""busting"" the real problem.
The kids are ""good"" kids and have respectful relationships with the adults (teacher, parents) in the show although fiercely determined in their crime-solving agenda and highly imaginative.",1343606400,3,627,5.408163265306122
