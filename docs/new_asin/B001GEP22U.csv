8305178,3,B001GEP22U,"Kalarippayatt is a traditional martial art practiced in the South Indian state of Kerala. This DVD consists solely of demonstrations put on by a Kalarippayatt school at some type of outdoor festival. Unfortunately, there is no narration at all, just the background music used at the festival, so the viewer learns nothing about the art and it's interesting background.

Demonstrations include flexibility and conditioning exercises, such as handsprings, back flips, tumbling runs, splits, high kicks, etc.
The athleticism displayed by the students is impressive; the only martial art I've seen that is comparable in this respect is Capoeira. They also leap, Evel Knievel-like, over a line of ten students on their hands and knees, through a flaming hoop, and over a bon fire. Some Polynesian-like torch twirling is also shown.

Next the martial forms are demonstrated, including staff, sword and shield, dagger, spear, flexible sword, and ball and chain. Two-person forms are included, pitting these various weapons against each other. Empty hand forms are also presented, and empty hand versus various weapons. Other demos feature one fighter versus multiple attackers (three and five). These are shown in slow motion and regular speed.

These demonstrations were quite interesting to see, but I was disappointed that no information about the art was included. They could have interviewed the master of the school, shown their Kalari (practice hall), how the students train, etc. Hopefully someone will do a proper documentary on Kalarippayatt in the future.  I've previously reviewed some available books on the art here on Amazon, which you could check out if you'd like to learn more about it now. (Note: it is spelled more often with one ""r"" and two ""p's"" and sometimes a ""u"" is added at the end)",1370217600,,1801,5.221453287197232
