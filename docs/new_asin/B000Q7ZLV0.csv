2833424,5,B000Q7ZLV0,Have almost finished watching the whole collection and it is almost addictive. It's relaxing to spend time with some beautiful people especially if you are an animal lover. It is money well spent. Those Brits are the best.,1189036800,110,222,4.868421052631579

2833452,4,B000Q7ZLV0,The shipping was great. It was great to watch all the shows that I remember growing up just as great as reading the books Almost. The only issue was one disc in the entire series with scratched and would not play properly hopefully I can find someway to fix it. All in all it was a great bye.,1516838400,,292,4.051724137931035

2833455,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"The spine of the DVD's says ""CC,"" which means closed captioning, but two different sets on two different HDTV brands will not display the captions.  Both TV remotes have a ""CC"" button.  All I usually have to do is push the ""CC"" button and captions appear.  I would buy the series all over again on Blu-Ray if it had subtitles and remastered picture.",1514764800,,349,4.507936507936508
2833456,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"I love this series.  If you love animals, this is a series for you.  It helps if you have read the books a bit first to understand the characters personalities, but it is not required.  You will soon catch on to how funny they are.

Try the close caption on your tv vs. the DVD player.",1511049600,6,285,4.035714285714286
2833457,2,B000Q7ZLV0,"Love all creatures great and small. Unfortunately this dvd set is a low resolution transfer of the original.  I would have given it a one star but I there are no other copies available.  I feel the BBC has cheated.  Amazon should label this as a 1960's resolution TV with very poor color.
I checked my opinion with a friend to see if my eye sight suddenly went bad. She completely agreed that this is copy off a fuzzy tv set.
I wonder if this copy is a true BBC copy??",1510531200,2,468,4.1208791208791204

2833462,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"I was so exited to find this series available on Amazon.  I enjoyed this program back in the 70/80's and loved the books which I read before the program aired.

It does Lose some luster when it resumes when James returns from WWII as there is a different actress playing Helen.

2833489,4,B000Q7ZLV0,"Enjoying seeing these again very much, but wonder if episodes have been shortened  a little for the complete package. I remember things occurring or being said that are not showing up in some of the episodes. Maybe just my memory playing tricks.",1502064000,,245,4.833333333333333

2833502,4,B000Q7ZLV0,"We have seen the series in years past, read off of the books.  This spring we had the privilege of visiting his home and practice location in Thirst (Darrowby) Scotland.  It is now a lovely museum.  Al Wight, the writer of the story and real life version of James Herriott, provided so many of us hours and hours of pleasure, chuckles and joys with his books, and with this series.

2833505,4,B000Q7ZLV0,"I got the complete set in early March. We have been enjoying an episode or two most weekends with a granddaughter or two as sort of a wholesome family nite with popcorn. I should tell you that we got to Series 3, Disc 1 last weekend and the disc is defective. The first 1:50 with the FBI warning and other preliminary stuff won't play. However, when you get it to the main menu, the first two episodes played fine. Great, I thought, but tonite we sat down to watch episode 3. Neither episode 3 nor 4 will play. I had to move on to Disc 2 which has been fine so far.

What I need to find out is how I can get a proper Series 3 Disc 1 to replace the defective unit that came with the set. Otherwise I'm just delighted to be able to enjoy the show again and share it with my family. But I wouldn't be too pleased if I find I've been stiffed with any additional defective discs. You understand, of course.",1499212800,,901,4.061797752808989
2833506,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"This is a boxed set for all seven seasons of the British television show All Creatures Great and Small, based on the five bestselling books by the late James Herriot (Dr. James Wight). It also includes the first two Christmas
specials from 1983 and 1985.  I think Robert Hardy put it best when he stated that universal appeal of the series is its innocence.  No illegal drugs, no violence to speak of (or only the kind that would make most people smile to consider it violence in these days), and almost no sex at all.  good story lines, excellent acting on the part of all concerned, and a timeless quality about it that most will find endearing.  Series 1-3 concern the time period before Wight and the rest joined up before World War II, and mostly covers the content (with extras) of Herriot's first three (or six, if you like) books.  Series 4-6 mostly concern themselves with the misadventures off the Darrowby vets that were covered in Herriot's last two books.  Calum and Deidre's romance is greatly expanded from the books and, in my respects, are more enjoyable than the first three series, which contained sequences which are funny to read in the books but which make me cringe when watching them in real life, if you will. Series 7 is the weakest of the seven, as they are several episodes of the 12 which make me cringe and where slapstick is taken too far, in my opinion.  Tristan is an infrequent guest from series 5 onward.  The 1990 Christmas special is really the most entertaining part of Series 7. If you like good clean, wholesome family entertainment, then this is an excellent choice.",1497744000,,1607,4.633802816901408
2833507,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"If you loved the books by Herriot, this series does not disappoint.  You will love revisiting with all the characters in Yorkshire, especially Siegfried and Tristan Farnon, as well as Helen and James himself.",1497657600,,208,5.117647058823529

2833513,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"This is a great series that I had taped on VHS many years ago. DVD's are better than my old tapes. Some have suggested that the quality is not great. Keep in mind that the early shows were made in the 1970's. We didn't have high definition television back then. I think that some folks are expecting 21st century quality from 20th century technology. Have only watched six or so episodes but I'm enjoying them. Then again, I still watch some old black & white movies.",1496188800,7,467,4.441860465116279

2833516,4,B000Q7ZLV0,"I was so glad to find this used as new was rather pricey.  I loved the series when it came out and was delighted to get this.  However, starting around the fourth season it seemed to lose it's charm a bit.  Timeline jumped to after the war, James has two older kids (one of whom goes on vet calls and corrects dad's diagnosis),  Carol Drinkwater who played Helen left the series and her replacement looks matronly and old enough to be his mother.  They celebrated their 13th anniversary and no one looks a day older, Tricki Woo still alive along with Mrs. Pumphrey making them both rather long in the tooth and for some reason I can't put my finger on it's just lost something.

Overall tho it's a good series.",1495584000,2,710,4.3816793893129775

2833540,5,B000Q7ZLV0,best of the BBC,1488153600,,15,3.0
2833541,4,B000Q7ZLV0,"I have no complaint with this BBC series, which is a fine adaptation of the novels or at least the early seasons are.  The acting and scenery are compelling although anyone who has read the novels first will always have images of the way  Herriot and the Farnons look, which will no doubt vary from the way they were cast.

My main quibble is that in this day and age that the DVDs are not available with captioning, both for those who are hearing impaired and, honestly because  many of the accents are so heavy they are hard to decipher.  I have subtracted one star for that and for the fact that the series changed ""Helens"" midstream.  I realize that sometimes this type of change can't be avoided, but it's still distracting and bothersome.",1487980800,,744,4.514925373134329

2833563,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"My wife and I watched this show sporadically while it was running on television. We simply love this show. Having the DVD set allows us to think back on old memories and see new shows we missed. The humor is so real we feel like we are a part of the family. We were a little disappointed when Helen (Drinkwater) left the show. She brought a warm, healthy, friendly, farm girl feel to the role. We missed her in later episodes. It would be a great addition to have subtitles; sometimes they are a little difficult to understand. We enjoy it.",1482451200,5,540,4.356435643564357

I struggled through the first episode, trying to understand what was being said and having the movements stall throughout.  The second episode was far worse.  After about 10-15 minutes I had only understood about 10 words.  It was not the accent but rather was extremely garbled and unintelligable.  I really want to see this series so I will likely try one more time but will return it if it does not improve as it is useless as it was tonight.",1480809600,,606,4.405405405405405

2833615,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"We saw this series when it was first shown in the US and loved it.  A long time later, the episodes became available on DVD and I got them from the library but watching them out of order and requesting them was a pain in the neck.  I finally broke down and bought the complete set.  I watch them two episodes at a time and it takes a year and a half or so to find time to get thru the complete series.  I think I'm on my third time thru now and they never get old.

What a wonderful combination of characters, story lines, historic background and scenery.  Absolutely wonderful.  Yes, I preferred Helen#1--Helen#2 looks too old for James and is not nearly as appealing a person.  But that doesn't detract from all that is riveting about All Creatures. My heart still clutches as war approaches and we know what Britain is about to face.

I have enjoyed this series so much that several years ago we went to Yorkshire just to experience the Dales in person. We spent a day in Thirsk where the surgery actually was, tho not in the Dales.  It's still a tourist attraction tho very real looking and people were there not in great numbers but from all over the world.  Another day we went to Askrigg where the fictional Darrowby is located and where they filmed the series.  It has not changed at all.  Yorkshire is still an unspoiled and beautiful part of England, with friendly people and some still saying thee and thy, just like in All Creatures.  If you go to England, don't miss it.",1441411200,34,1483,4.364963503649635

Behind a horse with a collar of bells jingling. For a small child the farm was an adventure.

All family can watch without worry of children hearing or seeing something inappropriate, beautiful countryside, great interaction between the characters, lots of animals. I grew up reading the books & this brought the scenery to life. It is rare after reading a book you like so well turns out well in a show or movie but they certainly did well with this series. Great family show. We have watched it many times over & do not tire of watching all the stories in the books brought to screen.",1406160000,,550,4.680412371134021

2833695,3,B000Q7ZLV0,"Seasons 4-7 were very hard to work through. I'm guessing that the main reason for most people who weren't exactly keen on the show after Season 3 was the recasting of Carol Drinkwater with Lynda Bellingham. Terrible decision on the part of the show's producer. Lynda has none of the warmth that Carol brought to the role of Helen, and also has a complete and utter lack of any chemistry whatsoever with Christopher Timothy. Rumors have abounded over the years regarding Carol's reasons for deciding to leave the show, but I'll decide to stick with believing she left because Helen had been taken as far as she could go as a character and she wanted to pursue other projects. But boy did the casting department royally screw this one up.

But the biggest reasons I just could not get into the show after it returned to the air were both the fact that we saw less and less of Peter Davison, and, even MORE troubling, the almost the complete lack of any real character growth for Tristan. He was still being written as comic relief for the most part...a complete buffoon who is still grossly irresponsible and incapable most of the time, and still treated like an annoying insect by his overbearing older brother (especially when he tries to stand up for himself, something even James would laugh at him over). If anything it almost seems as if Tristan devolved, showing only a few short (and quickly forgotten by Siegfried) bursts of brilliance, ingenuity, compassion and imagination. Plus, as Peter himself mentioned on one of the episode commentaries, he found it somewhat embarrassing to be pushing 40 by the end of the show, and still chasing around girls in their 20's, if that! And I have to agree with him on that point, sometimes it was painful to watch.

As I said, the first 3 seasons were excellent, a grand mixture of witty comedy, deadly serious drama (especially in the 3rd season, with WWII growing ever closer), and a good deal of educational material. I found myself going on the net and looking up a lot of the diseases the various animals suffered from, to get a better understanding of just *how* bad a case we, the audience, were looking at through the eyes of the vets, farmers, and pet owners. And although it was good to see a number of familiar faces returning (what would the show be without Mrs. Pumphrey and Tricki Woo?) I felt that, with a few shining exceptions, there was really not much to get excited about, and the show became formulaic to the point of asking why they even bothered to bring it back.",1403308800,15,2532,4.624444444444444

However, one can save a lot of money by purchasing them through Amazon UK (current price for entire series is UKP 42.50 (about $90 with shipping). You will need to have a region-free or multi-system DVD player to watch them. Or you can do as we do. We watch them on our computer hooked to a large (26"") widescreen monitor.

2833709,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"The first three seasons were based directly on the Herriot books.  After that, the next four were written up from scratch.  There is in fact a difference between the first three and the last four, filmed 10 years apart.  Not only are some actors different, but new characters are added.  Also, the tone changes just a bit, with a more incidental music.  Personally, I didn't care for the additional incidental music as I thought part of the charm of the original episodes were the silent moments.  Silence is rare nowadays and we forget how to appreciate it.

I do think there is a slight drop off in the quality from the original to the newer episodes, but it is maybe a half notch drop.  Still fabulous.

No sex.  No violence.  No cursing.  Fabulous for all ages.  One of the most enjoyable and comforting programs ever to appear on television. If you are having a bad day, watch one of these before bed and settle yourself down, knowing all is right with the world.",1400889600,2,968,4.526011560693641

I had read the books and still treasure them, but my husband was not familiar with the James Herriot stories.  Alf Wight, the veterinarian who wrote the books, revealed his love and respect for the Yorkshire farmers over and over, as well as his love of animals.  He had a unique way of telling stories of the farmers, animals, and his family, including Sigfried and Tristan.  How well I remember the times James would linger on his way back to Skeldale House, stopping to take in the magnificent English countryside, the rolling hills and the stone walls.  Just when and how did all of those walls get made?  Some of the stories are hilarious, some are heartwarming, and some are quite sad.  To me that is a satisfying mix.",1398470400,9,805,4.548611111111111

Acting is excellent - not for the squeamish though, as they DO practice actual vet medicine on camera. So humorous, love the actors, love the locations filmed, love the story lines and the screen adaptation to Herriot's books.

The interaction with the animals is as real as it gets, no special effects here.

If you are a fan of the series, there's no reason for me to gush about the characters and story lines, which are delightful. The picture quality of the DVDs is mediocre at best; obviously made from an inferior source, or perhaps simply what was available at the time. My only real complaint is the lack of subtitles. The audio is weak and when you add the accents, comprehension is somewhat difficult (ours anyway). You have to really crank the volume, so that's why 4 stars instead of 5. Every episode is included---the specials as well. The packaging is large; each season in its own standard DVD case, but seeing as there are so many complaints when DVDs are packaged in cardboard sleeves, this should satisfy those people. There are inserts in each season with short synopses of every episode. It's an expensive package, yes, and that will turn some people off. It is however great family entertainment and if you are willing to make the financial investment, you will be rewarded with many, many hours of enjoyment.

One of the main characters is Leland Stottlemeyer, a gruff police captain who is also Monk's patron and one-time boss. In this episode, Stottlemeyer is attending an ""anger management"" class under departmental orders because he slugged another cop who teased him about sleeping with his wife.

During the class, a patient goads him with ""at least I know where my wife is."" Stottlemeyer gets up and starts across the circle of chairs. The annoying ""facilitator"" steps in front of him and condescendingly says, ""Leland, remember your affirmation. Say it."" Pause. ""OK. These things happen."" Facilitator: ""I have a gift for you, to use when this happens again."" She gives him a yo-yo. ""I don't think so."" ""I can refuse to sign your release and you'll be with us for six more weeks."" Stottlemeyer ponders. ""OK."" He takes the yo-yo, slowly sits down, and starts flipping it violently. ""Leland, you don't have to do that."" ""Yes I do.""

Well, you had to be there, but the scene had me doubled over laughing. After the show ended, I started to ponder why this was so funny. Largely credit actor Ted Levine, who played the scene straight. Then I realized there was another vital element: NO LAUGH TRACK. It was funny because Stottlemeyer stayed so perfectly in character as the hard-boiled ""seen-it-all"" cop. A laugh track would have turned him into a clown, and destoyed the comedy.

I started trying to think of other comedic shows the were blessed with an absence of canned laughter.

Came to mind ""All Creatures Great and Small,"" the 1970s-80s BBC series about veterinarian James Herriott's adventures in the Yorkshire dales. Marvelously played by a superb British ensemble, it is one of that 5% of shows that cross the threshhold from ""acted"" to ""apparent reality""--where the characters are so real that you lose consciousness of watching a performance. The genre is ""human interest character study,"" but it is also comedy. The pompous but good-hearted Siegfried Farnon, the jaunty wastrel younger brother Tristan, and the solid diligent but often hapless James Herriott make for many a laugh--some mirthful, some convulsive. Again, it is funny because the characters are real. Canned laughter would have killed it--would have made this classic just another trifle of a diversion.

Not a single laugh-track comedy--not one--qualifies for that 5%.

One of the saddest examples of the destruction wrought by laugh tracks is another BBC series, ""As Time Goes By."" Jeffrey Palmer and Judi Dench play a couple in their late 50s who had a passionate affair during the Korean War, then lost touch for decades. Chance reacquaintance re-ignites their now-mellow passion. These two strong and fully-developed adults then have to contend with each others' foibles. Good premise.

It is exhausting to watch. The writing and acting are so good that you momentarily cross that ""apparent reality"" threshhold. Then that damned laugh track comes blasting in and snaps you back to recognition that you are being merely ""entertained."" So you work hard to re-gain the illusion, but soon again it is quashed. Painful. The British should know better.

A middle case is the American series ""How I Met Your Mother."" It follows five late-20-something New Yorkers through one theme after another, setting up just about every kind of dilemma, distress, and encounter that life raises. It is one of the more imaginative and well-written shows going and the characters are realistic, if a little overdrawn. It has a laugh track, but much modulated. As a result, you can half-maintain the ""apparent reality"" illusion. But you also half lose it.

I speculate that some kind of negotiation took place between the creative people and the suits. ""We need the laugh track to let the idiot audience know what's funny"" the suits might have said. ""But it degrades our writing and our characters,"" the creative people said. So they compromised.

I do not believe that the majority of TV watchers are idiots. But I do believe that there are two kinds of viewers: those who really watch intently, and those who are only half there. Laugh tracks serve the second kind, and unfortunately they are probably the majority.

It might also be that some shows are so bad, so unfunny, that they would never succeed without amphetamine-level laugh tracks. ""Two and a Half Men"" is a prominent example.

That doesn't answer why the GOOD shows have this nonsense. Let us plead with producers to become more discriminating.",1325980800,9,4571,4.9921156373193165

I gave it to him for Christmas, but truthfully it was for me as much as for him.  We were not disappointed. Loved the story of the country vets, their families, patients, friends etc. in Yorkshire, England.  The characters were quirky and delightful, the acting superb, and storylines were humorous, well-developed and heartwarming. The scenery in Yorkshire was breath-takingly beautiful.  Wonderfully fun and entertaining for everyone.  Highly recommended!",1325548800,2,633,5.227722772277228

2833837,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"This is my second, and very nostalgic, viewing of ""All Creatures Great and Small."" I originally watched it on Saturday evenings in the late 1970's on Milwaukee Public Television.

A couple months ago, my wife and I decided to make the investment and we ordered the full boxed set, (""The Complete Collection""). We've reserved each Sunday evening for viewing one episode. The result is that my wife, who only heard me talk about the series, is now totally hooked and looks forward to each weekend's new adventures.

The nice thing about ""All Creatures Great and Small"" is its compelling character development: it's very deep, touching, and over time, leaves you feeling like you have an intimate knowledge of each character. As a matter of fact, I began to feel as if I was part of the cast, albeit, a silent third-party sitting in on every scene and conversation. And, in my humble opinion, there's never been a more realistic adaptation of what a veterinarian must experience. There are many graphic, realistic scenes of James Harriot, Siegfried Farnon, and brother Tristin Farnon attending to the small animals of the local townspeople as well as the stock of area farmers. The series is also laced with humor which provides a very nice balance.

Supporting characters such as Helen, Mrs. Hall, the eccentric Mrs. Pumphrey, townspeople, and all the Yorkshire Dales farmers weaves this series into a very rich tapestry. Please note that these were simple, innocent times during pre-World War II. The direction and production of the series tastefully bears this out. The acting is absolutely superb. The making of this television series was a stroke of brilliance (many thanks Bill Sellars, Producer).

Quality television like this, in tandem with tremendous acting, is few and far between. Leave it to the BBC to pay attention to the details. I hope that everyone who invests in this series will come away feeling the same.

She also was enchanted with Herriet's dipictions of his life as a Veterinaian and the series helps me to feel the closeness we had while watching. His portrait of a scottish lad going to the Yorkshire Country Side is funny and heart warming.  In addition, having been raised by a Grandmother on what we called a ""Stump Farm"" in Northwest Washington, with seven gates to go through from the county road, no electricity nor indoor plumbing and folks with little formal education, I can relate to the lower income farmers and the animal interactions.

2833846,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy these stories or not, but I decided to give them a try.  I was concerned that they would all be ""tear jerkers,"" capitalizing on the viewer's love of animals by dealing with sick and dying animals in a maudlin manner.  While to some extent this is true, it was more of a natural mix of real stories.  Based as it is on the semi-autobiographical novels of James Herriot, a veterinarian who practiced in Northern England during the early part of the 20th century, the stories are a delightful concatenation of animal stories and the lives of some of the eccentric people in the area--my favorites being Mrs. Pumphry and her pekinese Tricky Woo.  (At one point after James tells the wealthy lady that the dog must get more exercise, she has her gardiner carry the dog around the garden three times a day).  The interactions among the central characters, the brothers Siegfried and Tristan Farnan, the ""new"" vet James and his wife Helen Harriot, and the marvelous housekeeper Mrs. Hall are wonderfully balanced.  The acting is exceptional, creating a sense of real people, people one would like to know.  There are disagreements, as there are in any family, pranks and jokes, and a loving support in hard times. (When a dog owner takes his own life after his pet must be put down, James feels responsible for the man's death and is supported by his wife and friends, subsequently able to rise to the occasion when another pet owner threatens suicide in a similar incident).  In the background is the rising threat of WWII; knowning as the viewer does that the charming world of these people will be irrevocably altered once the storm breaks, makes each episode a treasure to be remembered, and one can empathize with Siegfried when he sits on a hillside trying to remember every nuance of the landscape as it is before it is lost forever.  By the end of the series, when the two senior vets go off to take part in the war, the viewer feels all the emotional tugs of seeing close friends leave without any assurance that they will ever return again, and sharing a clear knowledge that even if and when they do, things will never be quite the same again.  I think in part that intensity comes from our own experience with the world as it passes from the ""once upon a time"" into the vague and distant future.",1299024000,6,2327,4.585542168674698

2833869,5,B000Q7ZLV0,This is excellent.  I bought it as a present for my husband not really knowing what it was and now we are both enjoying it.  Great series about a family vet practice that is great for all the family.  Quality and packaging is excellent.  Would recommend highly.,1221436800,,261,4.48936170212766
2833870,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"I was delighted to get the complete DVD collection of all episodes and specials for the BBC series All Creatures Great And Small. Besides the terrific episodes, there are special features such as an interview with the real James Herriot as well as cast members. As a history teacher I enjoy the touches to bring to life the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.
This is one of the few television shows that is funny, wholesome and riveting. The challenge of a vet trying to heal patients who cannot talk using the (now) primative medicines of the 1930s is almost as engaging as the human interactions.
With the deplorable (might one say depraved) state of American television, this is an excellent alterntive for great story telling.",1220140800,63,719,4.806451612903226
2833871,3,B000Q7ZLV0,"I have seen all the series by borrowing copies from the local libary, but would now like to own the collection. I must say, there is a definite change in feel when the series comes back after an eight year absence with a different wife for James and no explanation as to what has happened to Tristan etc. The specials help fill in the gap but the series definitely is not as wonderful. There was a real chemistry on screen between James and Helen in the original series. One could imagine that they LOVED each other. Therefore, the first three series along with the Specials, would probably be the best selection.

Please explain just what episodes are included in the ""entire collection"".",1218240000,25,689,4.647540983606557

Years ago, when this series was on TV, I didn't watch it because I didn't think that the film would be faithful to the actual books.  After viewing most of these DVDs (I'm almost finished), I find that they are absolutely delightful!  I only wish they had captioned them since the Yorkshire accent is a little hard to understand for these ""born and bred"" American ears!

While some of the stories were adapted for the film version, they're not bad adaptations.  The scenery is true to life and the acting is superb regardless all the way through--especially Chris Timothy, Robert Hardy and Peter Davison.  These fine actors truly captured their characters as described in the books.

I highly recommend this series without reservation.",1213056000,11,959,6.119402985074627
2833877,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"Few if any productions in the very history of television have resulted in such unanimous approval and delight throughout the world as have the wonderfully warm and humorous films emanating from the writings of James Herriott, the late British veterinarian now known to have practiced in real life as Alf Wight.  And small wonder in an age when beauty and human warmth for their own sake are virtually lost to humankind. I can say with honesty and openness that never in my 38 years of reviewing films have I encountered anything produced for television that exceeds the sheer unbridled joy of the Herriott stories. Any words I might humbly contribute will fade one day like desert-blown dust, but I am convinced that these masterpieces will live long beyond the breath and memory of anyone readings these words.  I am enthralled each and every time I revisit the series, which I try to do every 18-24 months!",1209081600,159,908,4.814102564102564

2833879,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"Thess BBC broadcasts from James Herriott's classic books are awesome.  The stories are so entertaining, whether you read the books, listen to the audiobooks or watch these TV broadcasts.  It really makes the stories come alive to see the vet practice acted out and the actors/actresses are wonderful in this series.",1202515200,12,315,5.1568627450980395
2833880,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"The original stories, as well as this excellent adaptation, have the rich complexity of life itself. In its world live people of every description: the humble, the meek, the noble, the preposterous, the grumpy, the proud and the vile. All Creatures Great and Small draws a picture of the human race that gives us reason to hope: Perhaps, even with all our faults and failures, we really do have the decency, kindness, good humor and courage needed to survive.",1199836800,7,459,4.822784810126582

After we are done with the collection we will be sharing this with my daughter and her family.  For those that are not familiar with the DVD its about a Vet set in the late 30's early 40's,goes from there, as he struggles to become a Veterinarian in a small town in England. He is the author of the book James Herriot",1198627200,6,538,4.163461538461538
2833882,5,B000Q7ZLV0,"We received the All Creatures Great & Small-The Complete Collection and am so thrilled the quality-- (and, of course, the stories)! Speed of delivery great as always as well...just love Amazon!

But, because, just under the image of the dvd set under ""Better Together"" section it said ""buy this dvd with All Creatures Great & Small-the Specials"" we made the mistake of assuming the specials were NOT included in the set.  We know with the Little House on the Prairie dvd's we had to purchase specials seprately.

The complete collection with this All Creatures set means just that! So when the specials we ordered as ""better together"" arrive we will need to return it.  I did read about the set but never read about the specials being part of the set.  The ""better together"" section threw me off, I guess.

We highly recommend this series for anyone.  It is a great series to view again & again!  We would give it 10 stars, if we could!  Enjoy",1195344000,142,943,4.598802395209581

2833884,5,B000Q7ZLV0,well produced and acted series ...i enjoyed reading the James Herriot books years ago and rarely do movie or television series based on books do justice to the actual printed material...was i ever amazed with this production..it brought the characters to life as you follow rural vets through their daily lives starting in pre-war England right through to the early 50's...theres so much humor in the old farmers and their pets and livestock and the scenery of the English Dales is breath taking...i highly recommend this series to anyone...whether or not you have read the books you will really enjoy these films over and over again!!!K.Crawford,1193443200,19,646,5.10377358490566
