YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER GUESSED THE END WOULD TURN OUT THE WAY IT DID. THIS IS GOOD SUSPENSE MOVIE THAT YOU CAN SIT DOWN AND WATCH WITH YOUR FAMILY. MY MOM AN I WERE SEARCHING EVERYWHERE, AND THIS IS THE ONLY SPOT THAT HAS IT. WHY IS THE PRICE SO HIGH?",1184976000,4,386,3.948717948717949

7952981,4,B00005RZQW,"Quite a fun low budget teen character thriller movie based on a book by Christopher Pike, where Sharon, a down the social status ladder bright and talented at the piano girl, is invited to hang with the cool rich kids as everyone's school days are fast coming to an end.  Ann, the mean girls sort of alpha character (played by Charlotte Ross) warns her not to hurt her brother Jerry, who it's pretty obvious to everyone except Sharon, is interested in becoming more than just friends.  When he makes a move she tells him she's not interested in him that way.  The next morning we find out Jerry died lying on the train tracks.  Ann blames Sharon but pretends she doesn't, as she has a plan to make Sharon pay for the death of her brother.

These teens are into abseiling down rock faces so there's a lot of nice scenery during this vengeance that doesn't go exactly to plan tale.  It was made in 1996 but isn't really that dated since a lot of it is around camp fires, a river and and the great outdoors.  You do recognise that some of these actors are much younger versions of their more famous selves such as Sean Murray in NCIS who plays Jerry.

There are moments such as near the end when it's obvious there is a green screen as the looking down to the river below while dangling on a rope on a cliff background, and the actor isn't really in this situation, and all the abseiling shots earlier in the film except when unclipping at the bottom the characters never look away from the cliff so it's obvious it's not the actors repelling.",1446681600,,1540,4.378947368421053

7952983,4,B00005RZQW,"The only problem for me(in the US) was that my blu-ray player could not support it and was unable to play it. Fortunately for me, I have a CPU hooked up to my TV so I could still play it on my TV through the CD ROM part of the CPU from the computer. Still played just fine and could watch the movie. Obviously it wasn't the best color since it wasn't in HD and actually looked like a 90s movie but it's what is to be expected. I know this isn't popular since it's more of a made for TV movie but I still like it :)",1433030400,,514,3.7685185185185186

7952985,5,B00005RZQW,I love this film. I fell in love with it back in 1997 when it first debuted on television. It's a thrill ride and totally unexpected until things begin to unfold in the end. It is definitely worth watching!,1397606400,,206,4.3076923076923075
7952986,1,B00005RZQW,I ordered this DVD from an American site. However the product was from the UK. They claim that this was stated on the order form. I didn't see any reference to this when I ordered. Although now I went back in it's there in plain English. So either I didn't see it or they just added it. UK DVD's have a code in them that will not allow them to play on an American system. So there my 2 cents.,1339113600,3,392,3.9125

7952988,5,B00005RZQW,I have no inkling whether or not this actually happened (the storyline says based on a true Story). It IS however based on the Novel by CXhristopher Pike. I had seen it before as a television film and immensely enjoyed it. Jonathan Brandis stars with Tatyana Ali and Charlotte Ross in what I would call a suspense thriller who Done it. Brandis's Seaquest DSV Co-star Marco Sanchez also has a part in this film. I love the movie and had a hard time getting it but at $50 US I normnally may not have purchased it second hand. As a Brandis fan it was however hard to pass up. All in all a wonderful film.,1254528000,12,601,4.234782608695652
7952989,5,B00005RZQW,This movie is great. Ann Price decides to set up Sharon McKay for her own faked murder since she blames Sharon for what happened to her brother. All works well but there's an unexpected surprise.,1225670400,4,195,4.6
