7666823,1,B01BSW1OFS,Boring. Couldn't get through the first 20 minutes. Nothing but a few men liking to hear themselves talk and think they've got some astounding insight. Not.,1468540800,2,155,5.0
7666824,1,B01BSW1OFS,"Men must not blame culture, technology and anatomy for their complete inability to keep their ""natural male instincts"" in control. I feel due to the plethora and easy in which partners can be obtained has facilitated in the extinction of fidelity in relationships . Women have exacerbated the problem by allowing this behavior to persist from their adolescence into adulthood. If all women began viewing themselves for how wonderful we really are ,the word as we know today would change. Men are not inferior by any shape form but need to stop letting media tell them what is acceptable instead of their missing father",1467676800,,618,4.951923076923077

7666827,5,B01BSW1OFS,"Why are some People so dumb? This film is a documentary! not a movie! I really enjoyed the film. I wonder why more people aren't talking about this. Tyra was awesome and Yung Berg was HILARIOUS. This adds a lot of insight into the world of Guy code. every woman should watch this. Way more informative then that "" Think Like A Man"" nonsense.",1474502400,,341,4.34375
7666828,5,B01BSW1OFS,"Started off slow thought I was going to have to call BS on the movie , surprisingly the interviews where entertaining, there where some valid points made long story short  it wasn't boring.  I'm giving it 5 stars because I am a firm believer in supporting independent work.",1474502400,,273,4.666666666666667
7666829,5,B01BSW1OFS,Interesting to hear men and their comprehension of why they make certain decisions in relationships.,1474243200,2,100,5.733333333333333

7666834,1,B01BSW1OFS,"they have every excuse,except the rigt one which is they are douchebags...real men,not famous or semi famous rappers would never say the s*** theses jackoffs say! BAD MOVIE",1468800000,,172,5.178571428571429
7666835,1,B01BSW1OFS,"This is a one hour film that consists of various men claiming they know why men cheat. It is interrupted by something that can pass for a film excerpt. In one such episode a woman finds a contraceptive in her man's pants and they don't use them. When asked, ""Who is she?"" He claims, ""Someone borrowed my pants."" An answer that says, he is stupid and he believes she is stupid. In the end they tell you how to keep your man from cheating. I won't ruin that plot spoiler.

The film was very boring. Here is my take: Men cheat because the can. How to stop it: You can't. What men want: beer, pizza, and BJ.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1468627200,,637,4.170731707317073

8751297,1,B01BSW1OFS,I couldn't even finish watching this video. Repeatedly referring to women as female dogs is not my idea of entertainment or a term of endearment. So glad it was a Prime viewing and I did not waste my money by actually ordering it.,1500681600,,230,4.372093023255814
8751298,3,B01BSW1OFS,"Learned a lot from watching although I think a lot of their responses was B.S. Tyga was the worst person being interviewed. I mean, just all over the damn place with his answers and not making a lick of sense. Answer the damn question!",1494201600,,235,4.363636363636363
8751299,4,B01BSW1OFS,"It was entertaining.  It's nice to see a candid look at a topic which always sparks such debates between men and women.
They guys seemed to be totally frank and honest in their opinions and that was refreshing to say the least.
Nothing new but just a confirmation of what women already know . . . and employ themselves!",1487462400,,319,4.406779661016949

8751304,1,B01BSW1OFS,They need better folks talking about their experiences. The people interviewed were whack especially that tyga character. He went around in circles with his answers. A zzzzz of a program.,1480636800,,187,5.266666666666667
8751305,5,B01BSW1OFS,"This was insightful. I was unsure about purchasing this by the reviews but then I noticed the bad reviews were just women upset by what they heard the men say. I get it, it's upsetting, I'm a woman who has been cheated on. But I would rather hear the ugly truth than a pretty lie. This was actuallly very funny as well! The guy young berg had me laughing so hard I was brought to tears!",1479686400,,386,4.092105263157895
