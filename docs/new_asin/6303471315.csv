8169382,3,6303471315,"The first English colony in Virginia was lost without a trace so that even the archaeologists are puzzled about what happened to it.
Pocahontas of the Powhatan was a young girl ( not much more than a child) when she kept her people from a war that might have wiped out the English before their colony was established. This video has slides with narration of pictures of
painted later of Pocahontas and one that was posed for in England on her visit just before she died.
The diseases of the European settlers were as deadly to the American
natives as any guns.",1246924800,,560,4.5
8169383,2,6303471315,"The A&E Biography ""Pocahontas: Her True Story"" attempts to clear up the debate on who this woman was and what she actually did.  Unfortunately, there are some unforgivable inaccuracies in this  documentary; the most blatant is when narrator Monte Markham, in describing  the time period of the 17th Century Jamestown colony, mistakenly says  '1508' instead of '1608'.  This should have been caught in pre-video  release and fixed.  The video also sensationalizes the relationship between  John Smith and Pocahontas (something Disney did as well), and implies the  desire for an intimate relationship that is not backed up by any real  evidence. The video constantly emphasizes the diplomatic skills of  Pocahontas to the point that it seems she was, at 13-15, in charge of all  negotiations between her people and the English colonists.  I find this  farfetched; even though women held a high place in certain areas of Native  American life, I don't think a young woman would have been charged with  such a weighty burden. On the 'good' side, it is interesting to see all the  artistic depictions of Pocahontas through the ages(who looks incredibly  light-skinned while her father Powhatan is much darker), and to know what  became of her son by husband John Rolfe. Since the video was done in 1995,  I think that A&E was cashing in on the Disney film (also inaccurate),  and didn't want to de-romanticize a woman who was incredibly important to  our early history.  It's a shame, because the story is interesting enough  without the embellishment.",967075200,13,1548,5.075697211155378
