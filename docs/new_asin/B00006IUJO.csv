1778919,5,B00006IUJO,"This was my first viewing of a Marengo Films DVD.  I was relieved to see that the quality is quite good and they don't use a watermark.  The Shadow Strikes has the best quality of the two and has no real problems.  International Crime is a bit rougher with a few splices and minor picture issues.  However, this is probably the best print available.",1243728000,,349,4.40625
1778920,5,B00006IUJO,"As others have stated the two films do not much follow the ""Pulp"" magazine story line. However the two films are pretty keen movies along the line of The Thin Man, Mr. Wong, Charlie Chan...etc. So if you like those you will like these. Any avid collector of Shadow memorabilia should have these historic films. Grand National Pictures was bought by Astor Pictures in NYC... they went broke and the original prints were actually thrown into the East River by the company warehousing them... for non-payment of rent. We found these two ""lost"" prints rotting in a collector's house... We spent a fortune to clean and restore them to the best possible condition... we did 4 digital sound passes, sound sync, color corrections, wet-gate, DVNR, and encoded twice. So while not perfect... we guarantee they are the finest on the market... Who knows where the Shadow lurks? ... MARENGO FILMS",1108080000,9,883,4.8933333333333335
1778921,3,B00006IUJO,"SHADOW STRIKES (1937) - ** stars.  A millionaire is murdered and relatives and an underworld goon or two circle in for the spoils.  In this one the Shadow is a lawyer/amateur criminologist, appears in a strange cape/hat/cowl outfit in the denouement scene and has his shadow thrown provocatively against a couple of walls, but that's about it.

INTERNATIONAL CRIME (1938) - *** stars.  A wealthy businessman is the murder victim in this one.  Lamont Cranston (the Shadow) is an amateur criminologist/newspaper columnist/radio announcer.  The beautiful Astrid Allwyn co-stars in this one as an eager beaver aspiring newspaper woman.  Directed by veteran Charles LaMont, who would go on to direct a number of Abbott & Costello and Ma & Pa Kettle movies.  The mood is definitely lighter in this superior movie.

 Rod LaRocque plays Lamont Cranston in these two early Shadow films.  Most of the juicy aspects of the radio character are absent here.  No clouding men's minds.  No bitter fruits borne by the weeds of crime.  No invisibility.  No distorted voice and manic cackle.  No real reason to go out of your way to see them, either.",1095292800,3,1132,4.973262032085562
1778922,5,B00006IUJO,"It looks as if Marengo Films rescued these two old movies from obscurity. I was thrilled to see they were on DVD and was not disappointed. Grand National Pictures was bought by another film company after putting these two marvelous films out. That answers why there are no other films which followed. These movies are fun to watch and are similar to such greats as Mr. Wong, Charlie Chan, Dick Tracy and the Thin Man... Oh, how things have changed in acting and style... though Hollywood did honor the style I think with LA Confidential... Both films are A MUST FOR COLLECTORS and the DVD is truly a CLASSIC. Technically, the prints are pretty darn good and the sound is perfect.",1063238400,20,679,4.619834710743802
1778923,5,B00006IUJO,"I love old movies and for Marengo Films to find these two forgotten films is fantastic. There are some minor flaws... but heck the darn things were filmed in the 1930's and the films are perfect if you love Comic Book or Pulp Heroes. These two detective movies are great examples of the old ""Who Done-its"" in the genra of The Thin Man Series... I devoured them. Marengo has obviously cleaned the sound which is surprisingly good and the prints are better than I ever expected.",1039651200,24,476,4.546511627906977
1778924,3,B00006IUJO,"Before I discuss the film plots, let me state that Marengo Films has done a great job returning two long lost films to consumers. The public domain prints were better than I expected, a few digital quirks aside (some freezing and pixalating here and there). These are scarce films from the late 1930's, so don't expect miracles, but don't assume they are poor either. For the price you can't go wrong.
Now for movie content. If you were expecting to see the cloaked figure you've come to love in the pulps and film serials, guess again. ""The Shadow Strikes"" is the ONLY film in this collection where Lamont Granston (not Cranston) puts the costume on, and only at the very end of the film.
In ""International Crime,"" forget it. All you see is a framed illustration of ""The Shadow"" on the wall of the radio station in which Lamont Cranston works as a crime reporter. He publishes a column and hosts a radio program as ""The Shadow."" Everybody knows who he is, and not once does he ""cloud men's minds"" while dressed in black. He does say the line ""crime does not pay,"" but nothing more.
In fact, nearly all of the charm from the pulps and radio programs is lost in these two films. No costume, no ring, no Cobalt Club, no sinister laugh, and not once do we ever hear ""Who know's what evil lurks in the hearts of man...."" You will find all of the above and more however in the 15 chapter serial collection (available as a double VHS set) and the 90's film ""The Shadow"" with Alec Baldwin.
Shadow completists will welcome these films, as will fans of film noir mysteries in general. But for those of you looking for the hero you've been reading about or listening to in the old radio programs, look elsewhere.",1035331200,71,1702,4.47588424437299

2 movies on this disc. I enjoyed both, but the second one is better in my opinion. Excellent entertainment. Happy to have this in my DVD/Blu-ray collection.",1478995200,,222,4.6923076923076925
7969729,5,B00006IUJO,"Not really true to the old Street& Smith books( I have a lot of them. so I can speak to this point) This was one of the early attempts to adapt books to film.

7969734,5,B00006IUJO,"The hero comes to life in these films. The radio character is slightly changed, but the character of the pulps was chaged for film.",1402012800,,131,4.5

7969736,2,B00006IUJO,"it pains me to have to report that the character depicted in these slapdash productions is ""The Shadow"" in name only. it's probably only fair to remember that these films came out in 1937, the same year sponsors finally approved the radio series' change in premise. in the beginning, The Shadow was simply host/narrator of an anthology series. then, in light of the fact that their narrator had stolen the show a' la ""The Fonz,"" one Walter B. Gibson was enlisted to write the series of pulp novels that turned him into a star in his own right. despite the popularity of the novels, sponsors had been wary of tampering with their already successful format. (some things never change.) the filmmakers may not of known, as the films were made and released before the modified series premiered in October. so there are mitigating circumstances to consider, but even so...
our would-be hero is here portrayed by one Rod LaRocque, a former matinee idol who's career was on it's last legs at the time. LaRocque's performance is wooden and one-dimensional, and even if it weren't his goofy, nasal voice would be all wrong for the character.
but alas, the problems with the characterization are hardly limited to LaRocque's stiff portrayal. like The Shadow's every other cinematic endeavor predating the Alec Baldwin film of 1994, the films completely eschew the trademark invisibility that made the character compelling (not to mention unique) on radio. in what might seem like a pretty stylish move in any other such production, we're always cued to the appearance of ""The Shadow"" by the camera following the movements of a shadow on the wall. in the earliest shot of ""The Shadow"" he forgets the scarf, leaving his face completely unobstructed. he doesn't even laugh his trademark laugh. and on top of all that, his ""true identity"" is given as Lamont Granston, with a G where the C should be. they did such a half-assed job that they couldn't even get his name right!!
the pedestrian plots aren't much help either. THE SHADOW STRIKES concerns an off-the-rack case of will tampering. an early turn of events - Granston/The Shadow prevents the robbery of a law office and, in the confusion, finds himself having to assume the identity of the attorney in question - should at least of been good for a couple of laughs, but no such laughs are provoked.
the second feature is more interesting. it's plot depicts Granston as the host of his own radio series as a sly nod to the medium that made his alter-ego a household name. also, in a distinct improvement on it's predescessor, familar supporting characters - Commission Weston, cab driver Moe Shrevnitz, reporter Clyde Burke - were also invited to the party. (there's no Margot Lane, because that character was created for the yet-to-be-heard reboot of the radio series. although there is a PHOEBE Lane.) so this one has a few charms. but alas, let's just say you know how much to expect from an adventure/mystery/suspense film when INTERNATIONAL CRIME is the most exciting title they could come up with.
as i've discussed in other reviews, ""B"" movies were designed as an ""added attraction,"" so they're not prestige projects and aren't trying to be. they're supposed to be formulaic and less than profound. they were pure escapism for escapism's sake. can you imagine the herculean effort it must take to make a palpable disappointment out a film no one really excepted that much from?",1342051200,6,3426,4.878216123499143
