8383131,3,B002WIXHYO,"I collect bad movies from the 70's so I'm happy enough to have this set in my collection, but unless you're die hard into psychedelia, vansploitation, or hicksploitation you may not get much from this set, the prints are good, and there are some good trailers, but no other bonus features. The first film Psychedelic Fever is part documentary, part silk screen pictures over pictures trip out, this movie won't appeal to a lot of people, I actually found the documentary segments interesting, but between the segments there are 10-20 min trip segments of psychedelia that are boring, but there is a lot of hippy nudity in both the docu and psychedelia. The second film Up Yours is essentially silly dated skits from a ""talking building"" if these walls could talk kind of thing, unfortunately it wore on me fast and I only lasted about 30mins into this one, it lacked the charm, humor, or nudity I was hoping for. The third film Summer School was the one I was most looking forward to and it had a lot of the cliche California 70's cheese I was hoping for, vans, beaches, skatebording, arcades, but the story was really flimsy and there was scarcely any nudity at all, and I would've expected a better soundtrack for a movie of this genre and time. The fourth film The Farmers Other Daughter is PG all the way, not at all the exploitation you might expect from the cover and title, it is a nice example of Hicksploitation if you're a fan of such movies this is a nice addition to a collection of that nature, but not a great movie over all, it's silly family fare pretty much. The prints and transfers look pretty good, and the presentation is nice, but this set doesn't have a tremendous amount of replay value for me but will sit nicely in the rare 70's section of my collection.",1354492800,12,1780,4.531055900621118
