5058334,5,B0076Q2NHY,"I remember this series from the early 90's when my nephews were youngsters.  We loved it and would sing and dance along with them each day on Nick Jr.  I now have a 2 year old great niece, and have introduced her to the series.  She loves it.  When ever she sees me with the laptop; she sits on my lap and asks for ""gulla gulla Iland"".  It's so cute.  I'm an so glad that Amazon is currently carrying all of the series.  I've searched all over the internet and could not find the series anywhere else.  They will be her Christmas present from me.",1451088000,,546,4.133333333333334

5058339,5,B0076Q2NHY,"I loved it then and I still love it now. More fun than Sesame Street (although I liked that show, too) because of the singing and dancing. Good for kids of all ages. A lot of discovery about nature, friendships, customs. This show is needed today to put ""FUN"" back into childhood.",1396224000,2,280,4.403846153846154

8511126,5,B0076Q2NHY,"This is my sons favorite show right now! We found the first two seasons on Prime but have definitely worn out every single episode, thankfully Santa Claus delivered this in our sons stocking and I'm so glad he did. This season is full of new songs, dances and real life family issues, I love that about this show, that it is based on a real family, problem solving real family issues at a level very young children can understand and relate to! I'm very happy Santa Claus dropped this off to our house, now I can get all the new songs and episodes stuck in my head and memorize word for word every line of the show! lol!",1515542400,,620,4.262711864406779

8511129,4,B0076Q2NHY,"Four stars for the show. The way they broke up the episodes making 4 ""seasons"" just to account for ""new Shaina"" was silly. And a 2 disk season vs the other 3 and 4 disk seasons, seems curious. The price should reflect the amount of content imho.",1498089600,,245,4.23404255319149
