1740706,4,B00006AUKK,"I am a medical student collecting movies about the medical field.  I enjoyed this movie for a couple simple reasons: It is full of amusing stereotypes, has some hilarious scenes on insulin shock therapy that would make a modern doc cringe, and Lionel Barrymore is a great actor!  I think I will look for more movies with this funny old fellow.
The movie is about a Young Dr. Kildare (Lew Ayres) who is doing a residency at Blair General.  He is in love with a nurse(Laraine Day) (of course!) and she can't stand the thought of not being married (my oh my), like the older Head Nurse of the hospital.  Anyway, Dr. Kildare doesn't earn much as a resident (yup) so he figures he can't afford to get married right now.  This little love story goes on around an incident with a Dr. Lane, a surgeon who is having bad luck with a string of dying patients.  Dr. Kildare tries to save Dr. Lane's reputation by convincing the hospital that it isn't Dr. Lane's skills that are lacking.  In the end, Dr. Kildare wins the admiration of the hospital, Dr. Lane, his residency director Lionel Barrymore), and of course the nurse.
Apparently there are 15 flicks about Dr. Kildare.  This one is the 4th of 15.  They follow the idealist young doctor as he emerges from medical school and eventually becomes an accomplished and confident doctor.  I would like to see the other movies as well, but this is the only one on DVD right now.
Following the string of 15 movies, there was a t.v. series about Dr. Kildare that ran for a few years when t.v. was new.",1035590400,12,1536,4.453571428571428

It's in black and white but you don't notice because the story is good,
the sound is good, and the picture is clear. If you liked the TV show

Barrymore, at work.",1349568000,2,359,4.0

1740751,4,B00006AUKK,"I always enjoyed the Dr. Kildare series. The casting was excellent, especially Lionel Barrymore as the irrascible Dr. Gillespie. If it were not for him, I doubt this series would have been as popular as it was. I believe this is number four in the series, and by this time Dr. Kildare and nurse Mary Lamont are in love, but Dr. Kildare only makes twenty dollars a month as an intern, so he doesn't feel like he can support a wife. Thus he has made no promises to Mary. Remember, back in these days (1940) women always quit their jobs when they got married. Thus Mary has started dating a young brain surgeon, who also has happened to lose alot of patients lately. He finally gets suspended from the hospital when the last of his patients has gone insane seemingly as a result of the surgery he has performed.

At this point Dr. Kildare takes up the case of proving that the patient is not insane as a result of the surgery by jolting him back to sanity via insulin shock therapy. This primitive method that was long a mainstream treatment for mental patients involves injecting someone with a large dose of insulin and then sitting back and seeing what develops. As a diabetic I can tell you what develops, sweating followed by seizures, possibly followed by death or coma. However, the medical profession, which had a primitive understanding of diabetes and insulin seventy years ago, thinks that what happens is that the human brain regresses back to its primitive self, then back to its evolved present and that the patient's sanity is sometimes restored in the process. This is how Dr. Kildare explains it in the film and it is both hilarious and somewhat shocking.

There are some other jaw-droppers such as after long hours in surgery when all the doctors and nurses involved light up a cigarette - in the hospital. Note that there is no such thing as biomedical monitoring equipment - nurses just come by each patient and ""look in on them"". There are a few things that are better in 1940 than today. For one, Dr. Gillespie isn't afraid to hand out straight talk to patients about their culpability involving their conditions. Today doctors are afraid to mention that an overweight patient might lose a little weight and improve their situation because they are so fearful of lawsuits.

As for the video and audio, Alpha is often hit or miss on quality but this transfer seems to be OK - not great but more than passable. I recommend it for fans of old classic films.",1237075200,,2473,4.615909090909091
1740752,3,B00006AUKK,"For this fourth entry of the fifteen feature films in the much admired Dr. Kildare series, the regular assemblage of talented M-G-M supporting players enlivens a somewhat rambling plot, with acting honours shared by Lionel Barrymore as young Kildare's overseer, curmudgeonly Dr. Gillespie, and Laraine Day, cast as nurse Mary Lamont who has an eye upon James Kildare (Lew Ayres) as spousal material. James, diagnostic intern at ""Blair General Hospital"" finds he has a rival for Mary's affections in brain surgeon Gregory Lane (Shepperd Strudwick), whose losing streak of dying surgical subjects brings out the compassionate best from the eponymous hero who, clandestinely with Mary's aid, applies the sticky method of insulin shock (accepted at the time of filming as valid) to a Lane patient in order to correct his condition of dementia, possibly caused by Lane's procedure, while at the same time hoping to save the surgeon's waning reputation. The film was successful upon its release due to audience perception that a graphic depiction of the sanctum within a major hospital is being revealed; it benefits from splendid cinematography of John Seitz, and also the familiar sterling cast of the series including those mentioned as well as Frank Orth, Nat Pendleton and Samuel Hinds as the senior Kildare, in addition to a raft of other performing stalwarts.",1162252800,,1360,5.243119266055046
1740753,3,B00006AUKK,"In Dr. Kildare's Strange Case, Kildare (Lew Ayres) urges a diffident brain surgeon to operate on an unidentified accident victim.  When the patient wakes, he rants about being in the wrong day: ""You put me in Thursday - I need to be in Friday!""  Failing to identify the man, Kildare assumes he was already insane before the operation and goes behind Gillespie's (Lionel Barrymore) back to administer insulin shock therapy - overnight to make sure the patient gets back in Friday where he belongs - to prove the brain surgeon wasn't at fault.

There are minor subplots with a moderate amount of humor and a bit of melodrama that would only interest fans following the series - like, will Kildare take a high paying job and leave the hospital?  Barrymore's performance is as good as usual, and the rest of the cast competent.

The cast includes Nat Pendleton, who sometimes played a sergeant or cop in Abbott & Costello movies like Buck Privates.",1129852800,2,944,4.766871165644171
1740754,3,B00006AUKK,"Lightweight, predictable (will the patient
with the mystery disease pull through? Will Kildare
hook up with the nurse?), hokey,
but not without some charm. Has some unintentionally
funny moments, and one can only thank God that
medical ethics have progressed since 1940
(that is if you believe the film accurately
reflects those of its period). Still, it's
reasonably entertaining, if not exactly classic
material.
The print used for the film in reasonably good
shape, except for some moderate damage at the reel
changes. Some rain lines, too, but very few scratches
or nicks. A couple of very minor video glitches.
The picture wasn't particularly sharp, but still
mostly OK. They could have put more effort into
the video transfer. The audio was decent.
In short a so-so transfer for a so-so
film. Still, when you take the price into consideration,
it's worth seeing....",1051228800,3,871,5.0979020979020975
7966703,3,B00006AUKK,"Dr. Kildares Strange Case, 1940 film

It begins in a General Hospital where the telephone switchboard operator takes calls. Dr. Lane arrives, he is a brain surgeon. Dr. Kildare talks to Nurse Mary Lamont. Dr. Gillespie comments on the medical report on a patient. One patient may have a pituitary tumor and needs an operation on his brain to prevent going blind. The conversations tells about the people and their era. Dr, Lane performs a brain operation on Grayson; others watch. The operation was a success but the patient died. [They smoke cigarettes in the hospital.] Later Dr. Kildare is offered a high-paying job at a research institute. Will he take it? Will Nurse Mary take a promotion? Dr. Kildare will remain to be a Diagnostician.

The next day there is a traffic accident victim for the hospital; no identification. He needs an operation to save his life from a fractured skull. The patient recovers but talks strangely as if deranged. There is a conflict over the results. Dr. Lane is suspended. Dr. Kildare will try to identify this man. Will he try insulin shock treatment on this patient? Another patient has a rash on her hands; they diagnose the solution. Insulin shock treatment causes horrible convulsions. A glucose solution is given to this patient for recovery. Dr. Kildare learned what the patient knows. Drs. Carew and Gillespie try to visit this patient. Dr. Kildare returns with the wife of the patient, and explains what happened. This clears Dr. Lane of malpractice, but Dr. Kildare is fired! There is a conversation over this. Whats next for Dr. Kildare?

This offers a view of medicine circa 1940. No antibiotics, not even sulfa. It shows conflicts among doctors, similar to the House television program decades later. Have the promises of insulin shock treatment worked out for mentally disturbed people? Do physical diseases cause mental diseases? Can a failed marriage result in insanity? This is a good story as long as you don't question it.

Frederick Faust was a very prolific author, most famous for hi western novels using the name Max Brand. He used many pen names for his works of fiction. He wrote the original Dr. Kildae story. Willis Goldbeck continued the stories to meet the interests of the audiences. During WW II Frederick Faust, too old for the military, became a war correspondent and was killed on the job in Italy.",1492214400,2,2368,4.897755610972569

7966705,2,B00006AUKK,I am actually still watching this.  The quality of the picture is very poor (could use restoration).  It's pretty corny.  I think that a lot of movies in the '30's were kind of hokey.  At least this one is hokey.  I wonder what contemporaries thought of it at the time.  I was looking for some of the '60's tv shows but ran into this.,1482451200,,334,4.140625
7966706,4,B00006AUKK,Old classic series. Just recently viewed four films in one day on TCM all equally corny but yet enjoyable. The interations between Barrymore and Ayres are great. Please get some more on Amazon Prime.,1477526400,,199,4.882352941176471

7966709,5,B00006AUKK,"This movie was made in 1940 . It promotes doctors who smoke cigarettes and discusses a ridiculous cure for insanity based on insulin shock!
Everyone is white except the attendant who is black and there are no bad guys in the entire movie.  Then why watch it in 2016?

Because the acting is fun to watch Lionel Barrymore is wonderful as the old doctor with cancer trying to teach the young doctor all he knows. The young doctor loves the young nurse but they do not even kiss on screen and no marriage until the young doctor establishes his practice. Reality seldom is seen. So if you just want to relax and take your mind off your troubles watching this movie is a whole lot cheaper than seeing a therapist.",1473724800,,707,4.430769230769231
7966710,5,B00006AUKK,I love all the Dr. Kildare movies with Lionel Barrymore and Lee Ayers. The combination of the two play off each other's character which makes it work. Dr. Kildare is my kind of doctor because you don't see that kind of concern today in doctors today. I wish there were more of a selection to choose from on my prime video,1462838400,,321,4.278688524590164
