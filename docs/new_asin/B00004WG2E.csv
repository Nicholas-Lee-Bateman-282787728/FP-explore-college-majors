1363813,4,B00004WG2E,"Heavy metal pulled this one out of having a lower rating. Heavy Metal is a classic and deserves a 5 star rating. Meavy Metal 2000 was only a high tech, better animation, ATTEMPT to equal the original. I was sitting through HM2000 trying to figure out why someone of the caliber of Michael Ironside would do this movie. The action was OK, but in places it seemed to drag on and was too easy for the heroine to catch up to the bad guy. The plot was predictible. The movie did have good action, animation, and computer graphics though.",980035200,,532,4.383838383838384
1363814,3,B00004WG2E,"Heavy Metal 2000: About 15 years ago two guys came up with a cute idea about turtles in a sewer who turn into heroic ninjas. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were born and became the Beanie babies of their time -- vastly overrated, trendy, and PROFITABLE. So what does this have to do with Heavy Metal 2000? Well, TMNT gave those creators big names in the comic book industry as well as big bank accounts. One of them, Kevin Eastman, used his big name to become Editor of Heavy Metal magazine and his big money to marry former Penthouse Pet of the Year Julie Strain. So how does geekboy keep his nude-model bride happy? He uses his magazine to promote/worship her at every turn. Eastman wrote the story which became Heavy Metal 2000, his company made the movie, and his wife is the star. Hmmm... something smells fishy here and I don't think it's Julie Strain-Eastman this time. This inbred, self-promoting aspect is the biggest problem (among several) that this movie has. Not only do you have the writer's wife as the star, you also have things like billboards in the space station saying, ""Play Heavy Metal 2000: FAKK2 The Video Game!"" The effect is jarring and annoying and makes your suspension of disbelief difficult. It would be like seeing a sign in the background of Phantom Menace saying, ""Star Wars part II coming soon!"" You are trying to forget you are watching a movie and this reminds you that you are.  The storyline is extremely simple and about as linear as you can get. There is one slight twist at the end but it is neither surprising nor clever. Don't look for any subplots here because you won't find any. Take out the T&A and tone down the violence and this is a Saturday morning cartoon. A simple storyline might have been okay if it were at least logical. In one scene Julie (the character's name as well as the actor's) tries to kill the villain in a bar. She stands up with her two pistols in front of the villain and three accomplices, all armed with automatic weapons, and doesn't get hit with a single bullet until the villain's FINAL bullet hits her in the arm. Once that shot winged her all four guys stopped firing -- remarkably convenient. But it gets worse. Shortly afterward the villain asks for a hooker and Julie walks in to try a second assassination. But the villain recognizes her when he moves the hair away from her eyes! OH NO! She's dead meat, right? Nope. He seems mildly shocked and says, ""You! What do you want?"" When she says she wants immortality he says it comes with a price then rips her top off and goes to work on her chest. HUH?!?! I guess this guy really, REALLY doesn't hold a grudge! He is actually surprised when she tries to kill him again, for the second time in about an hour!  Someone else said the CGI and standard animation were blended seamlessly. I'm not sure what they were watching. Much of the animation is good and SOME of the CGI is well done. But at the climax there is a surprise villain who appears who is all CGI. The guys who couldn't get a job on Reboot must have gotten the HM2000 job, because this CGI villain looks like an amateur version of the Reboot villain. Terrible.  Mrs. Eastman voices the main character about as well as she acts in those ""Savage Beach"" movies. I'm running out of space so I'll wrap this up. Two stars for the movie. The extras are quite good, even though there is more wife-worship with the ""Julie Strain, Supergoddess"" feature. That segment actually has the highlight of the entire DVD -- a very revealing shot of Julie's ""protege"" Arban Arnalis. She is HOT! FstFwd to 8:40 and take a gander. If one of these two is a supergoddess it's Arban. The extras get 4 stars, but so what? This is like a bad pizza with really good pepperoni on top, so the good extras don't raise the final score -- TWO STARS.
Heavy Metal:  Very good animation for its time, a variety of stories of differing quality (mostly good to very good), good soundtrack, and no shameless self-promotion. This is MUCH better than HM2000. Then again, Heavy Metal magazine was much better back then than it is now. Maybe there's a connection. Comparing the two HM movies is like comparing Toy Story to the straight-to-video Buzz Lightyear cartoon. In fact, HM2000 did go straight to video while the first Heavy Metal is a classic of adult animiation. This DVD would be a nice part of any SF and/or animation fan's collection. It's a good, cool, fun SF movie and I recommend you buy this one on its own. But it ain't The Godfather so it only gets THREE+ STARS. I haven't watched the extras yet but there are deleted scenes so they should be good and may have bumped it to 4 stars.
The boxed set averages out to 3 STARS but skip the boxed set unless you are a completist, have lots of money, or really want to catch a nice glimpse of Arban Arnalis (and you can rent HM2000 for that).",978912000,31,4851,4.4656144306651635

1363836,3,B00004WG2E,"I purchased this CD set because of the two-for-one deal.  The original 1981 Heavy Metal animated feature was the groundbreaking cinema graphic event in adult fantasy films.  Up until then the animated feature film Wizards held the crown.  Based upon several of the graphic novels featured in their magazine, Heavy Metal starts out like gangbusters with a 1959 corvette being dropped out of a space shuttle in orbit then plunging back to earth to the tune of Radar Rider as the opening credits stream by.  The best vignette is the entire movie is the film noir style Henry Canyon sequence which bears a strange resemblance to Corbin Dallas played by Bruce Willis in the Fifth Element.  The French fantasy illustrator known as Mobius (Jean Giraud) and Alejandro Jodorowsky sued claiming The Fifth Element had plagiarised their comic The Incal. They lost.  Getting back to Heavy Metal, the next sequence Den fetures the voice of the late John Candy, followed by Captain Steern (you got to love the name Hannover Fist), B-17 (this sequence was spoofed in a South Park episode featuring the Randy Marsh character), So Beautiful and So Dangerous again voiced by John Candy, and finally the best part of the movie Taarna.  Oh and the Taarna segment was also spoofed on South Park also (you go Kenny). You got to love a six foot tall, grey haired amazon babe.  Totally awosum!  My only gripe is with the ending totally lame.  You would of thought after all this effort that producers Ivan Reitman and Leonard Mogel could of come up with something a little more creative than the girl riding off into the sunset  Oh well.

Heavy Metal 2000 by contrast is a complete graphic novel from start to finish.  It too starts out like gang busters but the last fifteen minutes fizzles out just like the original 1981 Heavy Metal.  There are redeaming qualities again with the six foot tall amazon babe Julie voiced by a real life six foot tall amazon babe Julie Eastman and her equally bodacious sister Kerrie.

Overall I give the original 1981 Heavy Metal three thumbs up and the follow on 2000 version one and a half, that is if you can have a half a thumb in this deal.  Great flick to zone out too if you are storm bound in your domisile with lots of beer and pizza.",1426377600,,2252,4.634760705289673

""HM2000"" has an ok look to it. It has a pointlis plot that tends to build up on its self threw out the whole movie. I like HM2000's plot twist at the end were this new enemy shows up and takes what ever it is, that the movie is about. The shoot out sceen at the strip bar was some stylish action for shore. The music in the movie brings back naustalgic memories of when I saw it with my old highschool budys. Yet a little taim.

1363886,4,B00004WG2E,"Here is some excellent animation for a more mature audience.  Heavy Metal and Heavy Metal 2000 capitalize on the outstanding graphic publication of Heavy Metal Magazine.  The first DVD, Heavy Metal, was produced in 1981 and Heavy Metal 2000 is self-explanatory.  1981's Heavy Metal is set up in similar fashion to the graphic novel with multiple stories connected by a primary arc.  Heavy Metal 2000 appears to offer a new take on the final episode of it's prequel.  Both have the brand's trademark use of graphic violence and nudity.  Heavy Metal (1981) seems to utilize it more eloquently than Heavy Metal 2000.  Heavy Metal 2000's CG usage is, however, nostalgic for those of us who fondly recall the days of the original PlayStation and CGI's infancy.

Both features utilize some top-notch talent in the voice department.  1981's Heavy Metal received voice work from the likes of John Candy and Harold Ramis while Heavy Metal 2000 produced some fantastic performances from Michael Ironside, Julie Strain-Eastman, and Billy Idol.  Both films also have some outstanding soundtracks.  Personally, I find 1981's Heavy Metal to have one of the top-ten soundtracks of any animated feature with songs from Sammy Hagar, Nazareth, and Cheap Trick.  Heavy Metal 2000's also boasted some big groups with solid sounds, but they just didn't seduce me in the same manner as the original.

This product only got four stars due to Heavy Metal 2000's lackluster storyline and, at times, clunky animation.  I originally bought the set since it was the only manner in which I could purchase the original Heavy Metal; and the price for both was too good to pass up.  I would still highly recommend both titles to anyone who's a fan of mature Western animation or Anime.  Heavy Metal 2000 was a feature that I never felt the urge to walk away from.  But 1981's Heavy Metal still glues me to the screen every time.  No matter how many times I see it or how dated the animation and music are, this is what mature-minded animation should be.

The original had some neat extras and HM2k fit nicely into the original's genre of combined sci-fi, violence, and sexy characters.  The biggest difference is that HM2k is just one feature, not small vignettes drawn by different illustrators as the original was.  I also didn't like the music as much in the new version.

1363892,3,B00004WG2E,"I'll give you a measure of how forgettable one of these films was- I bought the new release of the original Heavy Metal and Heavy Metal 2000 at the same time. I found myself remembering almost every scene in the original movie, even though I hadn't seen it in over 20 years. Then I watched HM2000. About halfway through I vaguely recalled that I had seen it before, but there wasn't one single scene that I clearly remembered- and I probably only saw it about three years ago. It was that forgettable, that ordinary.
Don't get me wrong; this isn't necessarily a bad film. The animation is very well done, very slick and seamless. The writing and voice acting is competent and professional. The sound track is certainly better incorporated into the animation and story than it was in the original. Everything was competently done, it was just.... ordinary. Nothing jumped out at you. It was like a Saturday morning cartoon episode- just with a little more violence, and a lot more animated nudity (animated nudity- I mean what's the point?)
Personally, I'd save my money and buy the new release of the original Heavy Metal- alone. Sure, the animation looks crude by today's standards- but it was done the old, time-consuming, expensive way of drawing one cell at a time. The original was also crammed full of a variety of different animation styles and story lines. Perhaps that was because it was the first big budget science fiction animated feature and the people involved had so much enthusiasm that they tried to do too much. In contrast, I don't think anyone got too enthusiastic about this film. Sure, they did a solid job of craftsmanship, but where is the originality, the fire, the spirit? Kind of reminds me of the original Heavy Metal magazine, it started out fresh and new and just slowly petered out to nothing....",1077667200,14,1827,4.748427672955975

1363894,2,B00004WG2E,"I began buying HEAVY METAL magazine when it was first introduced in our country (it is based on the French magazine METAL HURLANT), and when I saw the first HEAVY METAL movie in its theatrical release, I considered it a pretty good representation of the magazine--funny, bizarre, sexy in a playful way, and open to various types of artistic interpretation. The DVD of HEAVY METAL appeals to me because it preserves the characteristics that made those early years of the magazine special.
HEAVY METAL 2000, however, is little more than a vanity project for Julie Strain, the wife of the current publisher of HEAVY METAL and one of the producers of the film, Kevin Eastman. One would think that Eastman, who gained fame as one of the creators of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, would present a new HEAVY METAL film that would have the same qualities as the original. But where HM offers violence to illustrate the depth of evil, HM2K focusses on the gore. Where HM offers a forum for various stylistic approaches, HM2K offers jarring combinations of animation techniques. Where HM tantalizes viewers with sexuality, HM2K invites us to leer. HM2K defines ""gratuitous"" in every scene and, in doing so, seemingly confirms every dirty stereotype about arrested adolescence in grown-ups who read comics. The only redeemable portion of the HM2K DVD is the bio on Julie Strain--the pure unintended camp of the piece is fascinating. But HM2K as a whole offers a predictable story with voice acting less animated than the standard digital recording on an answering machine. If you're looking for a recent sci-fi movie that captures the knowing, satirical and adventurous spirit of the first HM movie, buy STARSHIP TROOPERS. HM2K did not get theatrical distribution for a reason, folks. Take the hint.
I give this item two stars because the movies are bundled together. HM by itself is worth four stars, and HM2K deserves none.",990748800,34,1926,4.984472049689441
