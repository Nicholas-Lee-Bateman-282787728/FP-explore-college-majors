1390178,5,B000053GYD,"This has long been one of my favorite movies. I think I wore out the VHS (a long time ago). The Bridges brothers are both enormously talented. They could probably do their own piano playing. Michelle Pfeiffer is as good as always, and when she lies on the piano to sing, you'll be as enchanted as her audience in the movie.

1390213,4,B000053GYD,"I enjoyed this film much more on DVD now than I did when it was released in the theater. Maybe that is because I am nostalgic of when movies looked and felt like this. Jeff and Beau Bridges play two piano playing brothers who seem to have gotten into a piano bar slump when they get the idea that a singer may bring their act to life. Enter Michelle Pfeiffer as an ex-escort with an attitude but a sweet and vulnerable voice which is just enough to fill the seats and draw a crowd, allowing the Fabulous Baker Boys to rise again. Other have commented on the plot, I just want to add that watching them perform is worth the watching of this movie.",1440115200,,646,4.217741935483871

1390243,4,B000053GYD,"A great time watching a great cast in a great movie.

The Bridges brothers play the Baker Boys, a piano duo playing every lounge in the Seattle area.  Frank (Beau) is the brains of the pair, but Jack (Jeff) is the artist.  When the same old act no longer sells as well, Frank decides they should look for a female singer.  Their search looks futile until Suzy Diamond (Pfieffer) stumbles in.  Despite her foul mouth and attitude, Suzy sizzles on the stage and eventually in Jack's dreams and bed.

A truly worthwhile film.",1405728000,,522,4.559139784946237

1390246,4,B000053GYD,"I don't know if this movie ever made the big time but I found it fascinating, funny and touching.  Michele Phieffer is the perfect catalyst for the Bridge brothers.  Well, perhaps fascinating is too strong a word but it was funny and touching.  It's about these two brothers, one of which is very talented on the piano, the other, not so much.  So they play all these clubs and hotels all over the place for years while the talented brother is slowly losing it.  Enter Ms. Phieffer, the girl singer and watch the explosion.  See it, I doubt anyone would be sorry to watch this little gem.",1402790400,,588,4.4485981308411215
1390247,5,B000053GYD,"I could watch this movie over and over and, indeed, have over the years.  Michelle Pfeiffer stars in her first movie role and is fascinating.

I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a couple of hours of drama, beautiful piano playing and intriguing romance.  Don't miss it!",1399161600,,379,4.9523809523809526
1390248,5,B000053GYD,"What a movie. Two superstar brothers, playing brothers on screen as a tired, piano-playing duo in hotel bars.  Tired until they decide to add a singer to their act. Along comes Michelle Pheiffer at her nefarious best as the vamp that adds interest and dollars to the Fabulous Baker Boys' act.  Michelle Pheiffer originally intended to become a singer, but acting got in the way. She does her own singing in this lilting ride on tour with this Fabulous movie. Watching the Bridges' brothers' work together is masterfully accomplished.",1398816000,,533,4.977528089887641

1390264,5,B000053GYD,"What more does anyone need to say?????????

It's so cool to see these two wonderful real-life siblings (Jeff and Beau they look so much alike, it's cute) working together. And I've seen interviews of them together. There's this real protective thing they have of each other, as if, Jeff protects Beau. There's no competition here. Beau understands the level of his younger brother's talents and career successes. And luckily, here's a movie that shows off both their talents together. A great package deal.

This movie has, over time, become somewhat of a cult film, espeically for Jazz musicians who can relate to the ups and downs and frustrations of having to do these lounge gigs when the great club dates don't get offered to them. Jeff, who is already an accomplished musician in real life, is so magical in this, he exudes sexiness. Yummy! And I'm almost tempted to believe Beau is just as he is here, the older, wiser, pratical brother who just wants to make a living and have fun. Michele Pfeifer could take her act on the road, if she wanted to.

Just a fun film with great actors and wonderful theme music.",1388102400,,1117,4.688775510204081
1390265,5,B000053GYD,One of my all time favorite flicks. An adult themed comedy/drama with excellent performances by Jeff Bridges and Michelle Pfieffer-she does all her own singing and even was nominated for an Oscar for her work in this 1989 movie.,1387324800,,228,4.871794871794871

1390290,5,B000053GYD,"I think other reviews here pretty much covered most of the merits (and glories)of this film. All I can add to it is that this film continues to break my heart on repeated viewings.

So to my reason for writing this:  Could someone (Criterion?) please give this film the blu-ray treatment it deserves?

There are still many films that have somehow been by-passed.  I am sure there must be a large audience out there that would appreciate this film's getting the once over on blu-ray, and would gladly shell out to see it done.

And perhaps (if nothing else) some additional commentary by the participants and contributors.  I would be very surprised if everyone - from Robert Towne to the amazing cast - would not be up for some kind of reunion and experience/perspective sharing about how this film came about.  I'd particularly love to hear Jeff & Beau get together and share with us all their feelings about this film.

I could be wrong - but I have a feeling this film stands high on their list as a special shared experience for them. The depth of love and respect this film reflects in both their performances is definitely something worth envying.

 Jeff Bridges coupled with Michelle Pfeiffer make it a must have for any jazz lover.

 Michelle just makes you feel like you are in one of the great old smoky night clubs that were sretched across America years ago when some of the best must was written and played in many no name places.

These 3 actors have put together a piece of forgotten America that has been lost due to Karoke machines and prerecorded music.

I found it tediously slow moving and incredibly predictable.
Jack and Frank Baker are a brother piano playing duo in lounges. They are from an older time and business is not good. Time for a sexy singer to join thr group. Here is a brief bit of fun as a wide away of bad and goofy female singers audition--and all that 80's hair! Late arrival Susie (Pfeiffer) wins them over. No surprise that Jack and Susie's chemistry causes friction with Frank. Hey, what else is going to happen.
I don't know if Pfeiffer did the actual singing but she sure exudes sexual wildness on stage. I know this film has a lot of fans but unfortunately, I am not one of them.",1354147200,,899,4.294117647058823
1390311,4,B000053GYD,"This is one of those movies where, once you have the story line, it practically writes itself.

Here's the Scoop. Jack Baker (Jeff Bridges) and his brother Frank (Beau Bridges) are a piano playing team who perform at clubs and hotels in the Seattle area. Their type of act is on its way out when Frank gets the idea to put a female singer in the act. Susie (Michelle Pfeiffer) fills the slot and things start looking up. But as many problems as her entry solves, she underscores a basic problem in that Jack is simply too good to be doing this kind of work, but somehow too scared to let go.

This is a really good film with a great Dave Grusin score. In classic film score fashion, he has a few primary pieces that are repeated throughout with different treatments. You get the hang of the set-up early on and it runs like clockwork after that. You might call it formulaic but it works well. The writing, directing, acting and camerawork are all top shelf. It really doesn't go anywhere unexpected but it goes in style. Seeing the brothers transform from a hack nightclub act to near moving force is way cool. And when Jack and Susie have to do a New Years Eve gig without Frank, things really heat up. Both are at the top of their game.

There are a couple of cutesy scenes, like the brothers holding an audition for the singer, that are more of a side show, but I liked them all the same.

This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. It might not be great art but it's great craft that will keep you entertained for its entire 114 minute running time.",1336003200,,1548,4.346020761245675

Being a great admirer of all Jeff Bridges work,I trolled thru' his titles on Idmb and was reminded how much I had enjoyed the Baker Boys, so ordered the special feature version on Amazon, and boy,was I glad I did. The story line hasn't aged, all three main characters are so true to life, and the music standards are so well performed. Just wish we knew what happens to Jack and Susie  I,m an old romantic). Gets a definite thumbs up from me!!",1317600000,,508,4.291666666666667
1390313,2,B000053GYD,"I must be the odd person out on this movie, but it was way beyond slow. This was purchased with high expectations, as I normally enjoy both Jeff Bridges and Michelle Pheiffer.  What a huge disappointment. This would most easily be compared to readying yourself for an airplane ride -- as you settle in with anticipation and excitement ... then for the next several hours you are crawling along the runway at 3 mph.  Later, the engine slows, and stops and you realize that it's never going to take off.",1299888000,,501,4.555555555555555
1390314,5,B000053GYD,"You know what makes a good torch singer: a slow smooth sound, sexy, rivets your attention, looks great, delivers drama without the tension. All the same descriptions apply to this entire movie.

Michelle Pheiffer plays a former escort who decides to get into the singing business, and accidentally saves the careers of a lounge piano act, played solidly by Jeff and Beau Bridges. Michelle's singing is a surprising delight in the movie ... her every song a turn on. The story follows a crucial time of growth in the lives of all three main characters, as the brothers seek, in a consummately professional way, to calmly avoid sinking into performance irrelevance, and experience a new popularity which exceeds anything they've experienced before.

There is no high drama, just a very interesting character study punctuated with some witty dialog and sewn together with the fabric of Michelle's vocals. Its a mature film. Those who have experienced some ups and downs in life and career may feel it more deeply than a younger audience without such life experiences. These are people who have seen good times and rough times ... enough rough times to expect more and be surprised if things turn out better. Even the romance is jaded, and the arguments are sometimes funny just for their triviality.

Its a film that comes across as if it was a fine play ... the kind you have to admit to your wife afterward that you're glad she dragged you along to see.

Highly recommended.",1298851200,,1473,4.833333333333333
1390315,4,B000053GYD,"""The Fabulous Baker Boys,"" (1989) is a strong, steamy American romantic comedy/drama filmed at the end of a decade that, for whatever the reasons saw Hollywood make many strong romantic dramas.  It's certainly a showbiz drama, set in the Left Coast City of Seattle. Sibling pianists Frank (Beau Bridges) and Jack Baker(Jeff Bridges), played by the actual sibling Bridges boys,  are professional musicians who've never needed day jobs, but they're playing dismayingly schmaltzy music, and they're sure not getting work at the city's best venues.  So they decide to get a chanteuse to spice up their dual piano act.  After enduring a day of hilarious, off-key auditions, highlighted by a witty romp by the uniquely-voiced Jennifer Tilly(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seed-of-Chucky/dp/B00005JND2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seed of Chucky</a>) as Blanche (Monica) Moran, they choose beautiful, sexy  Susie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer).  Mind you, Susie comes with, as they used to say, a checkered past: she used to work for an escort service.  At any rate, the trio become successful beyond their wildest dreams. But when a relationship develops between Susie and Jack, the brothers are forced to consider where they're headed , and how honest they've been with each other.

The fabulous Bridges boys are, of course, excellent, light-footed actors, each of which has had a long film career, Beau in (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crazy-Heart/dp/B0039UT3LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crazy Heart</a>); Jeff in (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Lebowski-10th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B001AEF6D6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Lebowski - 10th Anniversary Edition</a>).

Now's the time to admit to an ulterior motive in writing this review.  I knew, from the Brooklyn neighborhood, the talented Ellie when she was making this picture, her younger sister Anya, and her hard-working, big-hearted, hospitable single mom, Debbie.  Deb died tragically young.  Ellie was only eighteen, and a freshman at Vassar College, having previously gone to Saint Anne's School for the Gifted in Brooklyn Heights.  Anya was going, I believe, to the Packer Institute of Brooklyn Heights.  Both these girls dropped out of sight after Deb's death.  If anybody knows anything about their whereabouts, I would appreciate hearing from you.

The movie is a fairly accurate and frank depiction of musicians' lives-on-the-road that reveals what happens after the audience goes home and the musicians retire to their nice hotel rooms to soak their aching feet. Sydney Pollack executive produced.  It's an inspiring, witty, understated, and romantic film, with a nuts-and-bolt, noir outlook.  Although it does, perhaps move a bit slowly for modern tastes.  It was written and directed by Steve Kloves, and is still a crowd-pleaser.  Worth catching anyway you can.",1295136000,,4188,6.379432624113475

1390317,5,B000053GYD,"Baker Boys is both an extraordinary film about music, and about brothers (a perennial subject of good movies, True Confessions, and East of Eden, to name two).  Dueling pianists Frank and Jack Baker (Beau and Jeff Bridges) live in a world of hotel bars and second-rate cabarets that, inadvertently, are preserving the sounds of the 1950s and early 60s into a generation that's forgotten what good music is.  Suzie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer--a pretty good singer, it turns out) drops into their lives and lifts them out of purgatory to an other-worldly revival that promises to resuscitate their crumbling careers and possibly to rehabilitate the swing era.  But brothers will be brothers; and although Jeff Bridges renders a portrayal that should have earned Best Actor for 1989, the lesser performance of Beau is often the more stirring, because of the genuine chemistry between the pair.  The film received five Oscar nominations (only Pfeiffer's was for acting) in a year when none of its successful competitors matched its screenplay, meaty performances or terrific soundtrack.  Not surprisingly, BBC is attempting a remake; however it will be hard-pressed to exceed the vitality of the original.",1289088000,,1201,5.267015706806283
1390318,4,B000053GYD,"In what has now become my standard opening line doing this retrospective of Jeff Bridge's film work I will simply repeat here what I have said before. I have spilled much ink this year, in the wake of his Oscar victory in the role of broken down country singer-songwriter, Bad Blake, in the film Crazy Hearts , arguing that Bridges had been preparing for that role since he first broke out as the future  good ol' boy, Duane Jackson, in The Last Picture Show. That thread in his work comes to something of  halt here as Bridges, and brother Beau, play a brother team of lounge lizard show tune piano-players going nowhere fast in the hard scrabble work of small venue musical gigs. East Coast version, mainly New York City and its environs. Bridges' here plays a more abstracted, more world-weary and wary, catch in a place that he doesn't want to be, life has passed him by, more existential anti-heroic role.

You know, now that I think of it, what this low rent brother act could use is a female singer, a torch singer. And of course the plot line in what would otherwise be an unexceptional film brings in just such a singer in the person of Michelle Pfeiffer to spice up the act. The tensions, including the obvious sexual tensions between Jeff and Michelle drive most of the film. And at that level this becomes a better than average film. But the real reason that I liked the film is, as I have mentioned in other reviews, I am a sucker for a torch singer. From Bessie Smith to Billie Holiday to Peggy Lee in her Benny Goodman days, hell, even Rosemary Clooney when she was in the mood could (can) always chase away the blues. Now enter one fetching torch singer, one slinky, fetching torch singer, one cry me a river fetching torch singer and I am a goner. Add in a scene with said torch singer dressed in a come hither devilishly red dress singing atop old Jeff's piano on New Year's and, well, be still my heart. I could add more but under doctor's advice I have to wait until my blood pressure subsides  Oh ya, before I forget Jeff (and Beau) did a good job acting here. But it's really about that silky-voiced, sultry dame, okay.  Enough said.",1287100800,,2155,4.445569620253164
1390329,4,B000053GYD,"For anyone who ever tried to parlay any sort of musical talent into a monetarily rewarding venture, this film is for you. Whether you are the proverbial ""weekend warrior"" musician or a renowned and financially secure artist, you have to go through all the metaphorical ""hoops"" to get wherever you are. Beau, Jeff and Michelle ever so poignantly take you through those hoops in an utterly realistic, no-holds barred fashion. How many groups have you seen like this: the average-joe player who gets the gigs basically due to his business acumen; the prodigy who seems to disdain all beneath him, which to him is just about everybody; the chanteuse who pretty much wants to have it ""my way or the highway""; the endless and sundry flock of wannabee auditioners who need just one chance to prove themselves? Sound familiar? Then you need to watch and absorb this one-of-a kind movie.

Beau and Jeff are so realistic in their roles that you have to wonder if the two of them, brothers in real life, actually did musical gigs together when they were younger. It seems as if sibling warfare in real life spills over in this drama. The mounting tension among the three principals is deftly crafted by the director/writer, Steve Cloves, who carefully and slowly weaves his story line to include not only musical issues but also how all this tension affects other facets of their lives. The supporting characters, whom many other reviewers have noted, are superb in their more minimal yet effective roles. No wasted motion in a simultaneously tough and tender movie. But all the above would go for much less were it not for Dave Grusin's gorgeous sound track and keyboard renderings especially as they pertain to the ever so hauntingly soulful recurring theme. All this good stuff takes me back to the days of my lounge lizard gigs, days that I'll always cherish, the good with the not so good!",1270857600,,1883,4.793846153846154

 She responded  in an email by telling me she and her husband tried to watch the video but it had a defect in it that made it stop at a certain part during the movie.  So it wasn't a very good present.

 Since we don't phone or write frequently, that's the last I've heard of it.  I notice that Amazon has a return policy where you can send back the DVD and receive either a replacement or a cash refund.  None of those options works here since basically I'd be telling her to go to the trouble of mailing it back.

1390331,2,B000053GYD,"When a film lacks originality, everything else just feels bored.  This is the case with the Oscar-nominated film (for best Actress) ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"", and why it remains merely a speck in cinematic history.  In this tired tale, two brothers - semi-content with playing a lounge or two here or there - living in the past, consider the option of bringing a female singer into the act.  One is the organizer, one is the chain-smoking wild-card that continually impresses the ladies, yet has a stronger passion for the keys.  It won't take a rocket scientist to realize which is which based on mere talent alone.  Throw into the mix a husky female singer, a mistaken love, and chaos between a seemingly stable piano act.  As our film winds down, clich over recycled clich is used to tear these brothers apart, and slowly bring them back together - in an awkward way.  While the film boasts collaboration between two of Hollywood's biggest brothers (one a recent Oscar winner), great piano music, and the quintessential red-dress-on-piano scene, what this film actually delivers is merely a tired script, an overused plot devise, and lines that could have been promoted by anyone with an Acting 101 degree.  While the concept seems dramatic, the final result of this feature (despite the numerous awards) felt disappointing.  Brotherly love destroyed by inevitable change?  Guess what?  Seen it all before - and better!

Despite the negative introduction, there were a couple of small elements to this film that worked, ensuring that ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" was more than just a one-star movie.  Bridges, muscled down by the day-to-day life of being a piano player, is watchable.  His apathy towards all situations coupled with his ""Joe Cool"" smoking-attitude, creates the correct amount of tension with unknown to keep the plot slowly moving in the right direction.  Beau, the weaker big-screen actor (better able to manage the television roles), tries to keep up, but what tries to be anger ends up just being a man with big eyes and anger-spit.  But, on with the positives...the Bridges' music was, for lack of a better word, fabulous.  Without making the guess if it was them playing, the tone of each of the songs respectively worked in their scenes.  Along with the music, the visions of LA worked to show that in a city that never sleeps, these two brothers will always have work.  Keep the drinks flowing, and you are sure to be a crowd pleaser.

With some slight parts to make you enjoy the hour and a half of a band's destruction, the rest just crumbled quickly.  To begin, while the pairing of Beau and Jeff seemed powerful on paper, the screen told otherwise.  Absolutely, the two were able to play their respective roles well - Jeff the darkened, smoking, looming brother - while Beau played the optimist, looking to keep his dream (or business) alive.  The issue with the Bridges' is that they are too far apart.  There is never a scene to show their chemistry together as amazing pianists.  Instead, we see through posters that at once they were happy, but those days are long gone.  We begin our film on a downtrodden note, and it never quite picks itself up from that even when the brothers seem to be back on top again.  Director Steve Kloves never gives us, the audience, an opportunity to cheer for Jeff and Beau's happiness. Instead, we are forced to suffer right along with them, picking ourselves up after each depressing hour.  The same can be said for Pfeiffer, and while Oscar-nomination, Golden Globe-winning, still means something - her portrayal of Susie Diamond just wasn't breakthrough enough to be remembered after 1990.  The prostitute-turned-singer routine has been done in Hollywood, over and over and over; and not to sound repetitive, better.  Pfeiffer's husky voice (at times in tune, at times not), and butch demeanor, did create a sex-symbol, but instead another tragic character.  While I agree, the story isn't conducive to happiness; somebody should have considered it as an opportunity to see these characters differently.  It would have added a new layer to their characters, allowing for a stronger emotional punch at the end.

As our characters floundered through their roles, playing piano and off-beat singing, the story was another part that just fell short - forcing our characters to have mixed material to work with and missed character opportunity.  ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" as a film doesn't work, as a television mini-series perhaps it would have been better.  There is too much left on the table from writer-director Kloves that nothing evolves.  Scenes like upstairs neighbor of Jeff's that is like his mother, busting the dog out of the vet, smelling bathroom equipment, and destroying memorabilia, look good on paper, but without the correct backing just doesn't feel finished.  That is the overall feel with ""Baker Boys"", a sense that scenes, moments, and plot-points went unfinished.  Kloves isn't the best in handling the talent he has hired.  From leaving cameramen in shots to overusing the piano music, Kloves believes in his work (there is no argument there), but his execution is fallible.  Why would you use piano music as your theme music when the Bridges are playing piano music as well?  This was horrible.  With strong keys being played by the brothers, the cheesy background music just diluted the overall feel.  It is the perfect example of having authentic reality and a cheap knock-off.  With lacking characters, it would be up to Kloves to cover the differences, but he can't control what is happening.  His camera direction, musical focus, and story have too many flawed plot holes that instead of a creative story, we are left with a sad overused clich.  I would agree that these boys are ""Fabulous"", but Kloves couldn't prove it.  His scientific directional equation remains a hypothesis.

VIDEO:  With cheap VHS quality of DVD, a lackluster story, and mixed characters.  ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" failed in its attempts to prove to me that at this moment, the band had to be destroyed.  Perhaps they should have been on a ""Mission from God"".

VISUAL:  For being an Oscar-nominated film, the transfer was horrid.  The quality is similar to finding this film on VHS (probably where it is most comfortable), and while you can scratch the surface and see the talent - our actors just don't bring it.  The graininess of their decisions corrupts the story even further, making the final output unmemorable.

SOUND:  The key element to this film actually sounds pretty good with the Bridges brothers are playing, but it is Kloves disappointing use of similar piano music in the background which becomes tiresome to the ears.  Creating tension to here the Bridges play would mean little to no background music, but the diluted extra music fails to make this a film about pianos and for pianos.  Instead, it is like going to Chuck-E-Cheese and having too much pizza.

EXTRA:  Nothing.  Languages, if you consider those extras is all we are given for this award-winning film.  Bummer.

Overall, I wasn't a fan of this film.  Bridges is like a modern Gene Hackman, while the film may not be good, he continually shows that he can be good in anything, alas, not everyone could keep up (even our director).  Our mood, music, and plot points were all misused and poorly developed.  Our story, clich after clich, didn't feel original or exciting.  There needed to be some brightness at the end of our tunnel, but nobody could demonstrate this.  ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" could have been a shifting film for everyone, but it just wasn't able to contain the solid nature of the work.  It was corrosive and disappointing.

1390332,4,B000053GYD,"Lots of folks comment on the piano playing, which is a delight, and most everyone has commented on Michelle Pfeiffer, and well they should.  It was a stunning breakthrough film for her and remains, for me, one of her best.  But it isn't the best performance in the film.  That honor goes to Jeff Bridges, who does everything to flesh out an unfleshed out character.  The one weakness in Steve Kloves's self-directed script is that the younger Baker Brother has oodles of talent and a chip on his shoulder, yet we never discover why.  Where did it come from?  Why has he stayed with his brother for so long?  What trauma or event caused him to stay at a job that is clearly beneath him, working with a brother he has clearly outgrown?  We're never given even a minor clue.  And it's a tribute to Bridge's economical, precisely calibrated portrayal that while we're watching, we don't care.

Actors with cigarettes hanging out of their mouth are usually walking cliches. Yet when Bridges sits at the piano with the cigarette dangling, his fingers tickling the ivories in the same arrangements his brother has insisted on for the past 15 years, his face a sullen mask while his tired eyes tune out his brother's tired comic patter, you get the immediate impression that in smoking, he's blowing impotent defiance his brother's way. That's a real acting choice and a funny, ironic one.  We chuckle at his character's enigmatic passive aggression right on through...until the colors reveal some heavy duty self-loathing and Pfeiffer's character busts him...You could interpret the last scene as either hopeful or despairing, and that's the wonder of it.

Twenty years ago I loved the piano playing and Michelle Pfeiffer.  I still love those elements now, but when you watch this film, pay close attention to everything Jeff Bridges does.  It's a marvel.",1268524800,,1848,4.862619808306709

1390334,5,B000053GYD,"Steve Kloves came out of nowhere and wrote and directed a fabulous film. How did he do it? He got everything so right. The writing and directing is so great, you would have thought he was a veteran. The Baker Boys (Jeff and Beau Bridges) are brothers who have never had day jobs, but work in hotel lounges and bars with a piano duo act. Business slows down, so they take on a singer (Michelle Pfeiffer), which boosts their business, but also complicates things. The story could have been a clich, but instead it is like a dazzling solo that rarely if ever hits a wrong note.

Kloves is the master of words, and the master of sound and vision. The imagery tells a story where one picture can be worth a thousand words. The use of music is also effective. The scenes of Michelle singing are the high points, but other musical interludes, featuring Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Tony Bennett, and Dave Grusin also stir the emotions. The dialogue is snappy, with brother Jack Baker (Jeff Bridges), a man of few, but well-chosen words. Short choppy sentences, like Bogart or Phillip Marlowe in a film noir hard-boiled detective story. It's like Ernest Hemmingway worked on the screenplay. Oftentimes a line will be repeated, by another character, once the tables have turned. Watch for it. Play a drinking game, and take a swig whenever he does it. Like the jazz played after hours by Jack Baker, this film has a cult following. Perhaps not a lot of people know about this film, but those that do really love it. One of the films biggest fans is J.K. Rowling, and perhaps that is why Steve Kloves now toils in Potter's field.

Michelle Pfeiffer sang surprisingly well. If she was interested, she could have had a great singing career. I was watching her in Batman Returns as Selina Kyle / Cat Woman, and she was lousy. But this film restored my faith in her acting. As noted in Beneath Mulholland: Thoughts on Hollywood and Its Ghosts by David Thomson, her character, Susie Diamond never smiles. Thomson has a story in there where he ruminates on what would happen if a casting agent saw her talent for not smiling and sent her out on an audition. Is that the secret to her style? Is she the Anti-Julia Roberts? One thing is for sure; Susie Diamond is Jack's perfect foil.

----------------------------
Susie Diamond: Listen, you're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not going to start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some sort of princess when I burp?
===================================

Jeff oftentimes plays characters called Jack (Jack Warrick in The Muse, Jack Kelton in American Heart, Jack Lucas in The Fisher King, President Jackson Evans in The Contender, Duane Jackson in The Last Picture Show). Like many of his Jack characters, this one has an edge. He is not a nice guy. He is brooding, angry, with a large chip on his shoulder, always on the verge of exploding into violence. On the other hand, he is an artist with a sensitive side, though he keeps it well hidden. He loves his dog, Eddie, so he can't be all bad. Jeff Bridges gave one of his great performances here, rivaling even The Dude from The Big Lebowski. The Dude abides. Jack Baker abides as well. There is excellent interplay between Jeff and Michelle as Jack and Susie.

------------------------
Jack Baker: What do you want from me? You want me to tell you to stay, hmm? Is that what you're looking for? You want me to get down on my knees and beg you to save the Baker Boys from doom? Forget it, sweetheart. We survived for 15 years before you strutted onto the scene. Fifteen years. Two seconds, you're bawling like a baby. You shouldn't be wearing a dress; you should be wearing a diaper.
================================

Jeff & Beau Bridges were excellent as brothers, because they really are brothers. They portrayed the sibling rivalry so well.
There was a lot of love and respect between them, but also, like most brothers, a lot of fighting and bickering as well. Great scene near the beginning where Jack sprays liquid hair on Frank, as per his request. It sets the tone right off. Also a later scene where Frank dances with Jack to Benny Goodman's Moonglow in the hotel as he explains to Susie how Jack taught him to dance, which helped him woo his wife. Throughout there is great brotherly interaction, where they can communicate with each other with just a look, like in the scene where they audition the singers, the first 37 of whom couldn't even carry a tune in a bucket.

Which brings us to Jennifer Tilly as Monica Moran, real name Blanche. Her rendition of The Candy Man was superbly horrible. I loved her nervous gestures where she puts her hands in her sweater--and that voice! Guess she has made a career out of acting like a bad singer or actress, and doing it very well. She was nominated for an Oscar for playing an earnest but untalented actress in Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway. Here, she is just so perfect, but then all the singers in the audition montage were all fabulously horrible, though Tilly managed to top them all.

Bottom line is The Fabulous Baker Boys is fabulous. Susie gives Jack tough love when she realizes that he has real musical talent and is wasting it on the lounge circuit. There is a romance, but it is between a boy and his piano. Also, by the way, Jack and Susie. Theirs is a romance that avoids sentimentality, avoids a cloying Hollywood ending, yet you feel that Jack and Susie will get together. Just an intuition (take a swig, those of you who are playing the Baker Boys drinking game).

Jack Baker: You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight. We were always small time, but we were never clowns.

The female singer auditions - smart humor; way before American Idol was even a thought - good fun.

Beau Bridges' character getting help (from his brother) with his spray-on hair - more good fun.

Jeff Bridges playing quiet solo jazz piano at 'Henry's' - his soul leaks out.

When Jeff Bridges' character reminds Blanch the waitress that ""it's cold outside.""

The ending. I'll wager the writer/director had to fight hard for this one as he went off the Hollywood ending menu - good thing he did -  it's just what the real world ordered.",1235433600,,709,4.415384615384616

1390370,5,B000053GYD,"Many years ago, a big screen, theatrical viewing of Woody Allen's Gershwin inspired film, ""Manhattan"" started me on a love affair with what is known as the 'Great American Songbook'. So for years, I've been listening to everyone from Ella to Billie Holiday to Diana Krall and Jane Monheit. For some reason, I've always had a special affinity for what is known as 'the girl singer'. I love the sound and image of those classic songs being crooned by a torch singer at 2am in some smokey dive. Thats' why I was delighted to run across ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"", while channel surfing on cable recently. How, I never got a chance to see this film before is beyond me.

The plot is an update of that classic old movie formula of the two partners, who lets the girl come between them. The title of the film refers to a cocktail music act, featuring two brothers, who play piano side by side. Frank Baker (Beau Bridges) is balding, short, pudgey and talkative. He's rather conservative, but will do almost anything to keep the act going and get paid, so he can support his family and suburban lifestyle. His brother, Jack Baker (Jeff Bridges) is the total opposite. Jack is  tall, handsome and silent with a perpetual cigerette dangling from his mouth. He's a stoic, urban loner, who seems as tough as nails.

The Baker Boys act of patter and standards seems to have gone stale long ago. They play to dingy, half-empty rooms and even those jobs are starting to dry up. Frank decides to liven things up by hiring a 'girl singer'. Into the brother's lives walks Susie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer). She's all sex appeal with dangly earrings, high heeled stilletos and low cut dresses. To back it up, this dangerously cool lady has one heck of a voice. The gambit pays off and the brothers once again start seeing some success. But from the beginning, its' obvious, that there is a smoldering, sensual connection between Susie and the stoic, Jack. This causes friction between the two brothers and age old arguments, rivalries and ambitions come to an emotional head threatening the partnership.

This really is a wonderful movie featuring a well constructed script and delightful performances from all three of the film's leads. I think it really helps, that the Baker brothers are played by the real life Bridges brothers. You can definitely feel that family vibe between the two men as they express in their characters a love-hate relationship, that can never be broken. This is the film, that made Michelle Pfieffer a true box office star. She really does seem to shine in every scene she's in. The scene, where she rolls around on a grand piano, while singing ""Makin' Whoopie"" is a classic, that has to count among the sexiest moments in all of cinema.

Finally, mention should be made of the wonderful music in this film. There are lots of standards including ""My Funny Valentine"", ""Lullaby of Birdland"", ""Moonglow"", ETC. In addition to that, Jazz artist, Dave Grusin has composed an amazing score, that contributes to the emotional mood of the film and keeps your toes a tappin'.

This is one of those films with a good story, great performances and wonderful music. What more could you ask for? Highly recommended!",1216166400,,3211,4.755834829443447

1390373,5,B000053GYD,"If ever there was a movie title that really `said it all' then it would have to be `The Fabulous Baker Boys' because, while Michele Pfeiffer is utterly stunning in her portrayal of lounge singer Susie Diamond, it is the Bridges brothers (who happen to play the Baker brothers) who really prove themselves `fabulous' in this film.  I am a longstanding fan of Jeff Bridges, an actor who is solid in everything he does, but it wasn't until this wonderful film that I was drawn to the splendor that is Jeff's real-life brother Beau who, in all honesty, became the highlight for me here.  Truly though, all three actors draw off one another beautifully to help create a fabulous movie experience.

Some have noted that the plot is thin, and while that may be the case it truly doesn't matter.  A story, when told right, doesn't need to be bogged down with heavy subplots and meaning.  A simple, clean and refreshing story such as this can be just as rewarding, especially when handled as delicately and as efficiently as it is here.

The title of the film refers to the dueling piano act of Frank and Jack Baker.  Frank is the older more stable brother.  He has a wife and two kids, a home and a mind for management.  He plans their gigs, sets their schedules, decides their song numbers, obsesses over their appearance.  He is all about making the money, and he knows what to do in order to make that happen.  Jack is the younger yet more talented brother.  He drifts from woman to woman, all the while avoiding any real commitment.  He doesn't really care about the money aspect of things, as can be seen by his crumby living conditions.  He doesn't care to fix his hair before a gig and has no quarrels with smoking on stage.  He's calm, collected and always seemingly amused, yet there is enough going on under the surface to convince the audience that that is not entirely the case.

Trouble is lurking around the corner for these boys though.  Their act is getting stale and so to liven things up (and fill a few more seats) they decide to take on a singer.

Enter Susie Diamond.  Susie is not the type of girl the boys expected (she's a bit rough around the edges) but her talent is undeniable, and her charm shines through the cracks in her rough exterior.  Things are looking up for the boys, but as can be expected, there will be there fair share of bumps along the way.

Like I said; a simple story.  Sure, the film does touch upon staying true to ones self and not compromising ones dreams for the sake of others (case in point being Jack's continuing to play alongside his brother when he finds it humiliating and ultimately wishes he could pursue something more self gratifying) but in the end the film is merely a beautifully entertaining ride.

The film is elevated by three superb performances.  Michele Pfeiffer has been singled out (she being the only one to receive an Oscar nomination) and her performance is definitely worthy of singling out.  As Susie she exudes this edgy sensuality that permeates the screen whenever she's on it.  Her initial audition scene alone is a perfect example of an actress who acts from her fingertips down to her toes.  She is so on point, so magnificent, able to allow the audience to take down her character like fine whiskey; she goes down smooth but leaves a burn.

But this movie belongs to the boys; the Bridges boys that is.  Their performances are utterly unavoidable here.  Jeff is seriously one of our finest working actors, always nestled beautifully into his character.  He has proven time and time again to be consistent and reliable and a stable centerpiece to each and every one of his films.  Here is no exception.  As Jack he displays such commanding presence without demanding it from us.  He is always calm and collected, even when agitated and pushed to his limits.  His voice is barely ever raised above a considerate speaking tone and this adds weight to his character, a repressed and passive brother to Beau's Frank who is most definitely the dominant force in the brothers partnership.  Beau delivers what may be my favorite performance in the film.  Frank is sporadic and all over the place one minute then completely grounded and confident the next.  He plays a part, a part that he is comfortable with because it allows him to live a comfortable life, but unlike Jack, Frank has allowed this part to define him.  When Jack calls him out on it towards the end of the film you can see the disbelief in Frank's eyes and the instinctual response of justification.

Brilliant.

In the end I highly recommend this delightful film.  I love it when actors really clench down on a role and let it run through them as if it were their life sustaining blood.  All three of these actors do just that, and the result is nothing short of `fabulous'.",1213660800,,4810,4.583138173302108

1390378,5,B000053GYD,"I didn't bother to see this when it came out.  All I heard about it was that Michelle Pfeiffer sang on a piano and that wasn't enough to draw me into the theater.  But...wow!  This is a much under-rated film.  Three really good actors who never have received the acclaim they deserve:  the Bridges and Pfeiffer---together here, with an intelligent script and careful direction, and the magic happens.

Michelle Pfeiffer is so beautiful that I think people don't realize what a good actress she is.  She is very funny and real as the ex-escort girl who dresses like she's going to a Halloween party till they fix her up.  It's a role that could have easily descended into a cliche--the tough, gum-chewing, lower class chick---but Pfeiffer plays her as a real person and she emerges as a strong, smart woman whose character shocks everyone else into action.  She keeps her sort of klutzy vulnerability too, even after their ""success"" which makes her very appealing. Yes, she is unforgettable on top of that Steinway and she truly deserves a spot in the Hollywood Hall of Fame for that but there is a lot more to her performance than that.

Jeff Bridges is equally as charming and heart-throbbing (something for the ladies) and they make worthy adversaries/lovers.  The tension that builds up between them is maddening--The scenes in the hotel where they almost get together but don't quite--are so life-like  that anyone who has lived through such ordeals will have to laugh.  You want to scream at the screen ""Get together, already!"" No wonder they both smoke so much.

Beau, the not-quite-as hunky brother is perfect in his role, too.  He plays Frank, the responsible one, who books the act, makes sure everyone's on time and sprays black paint to cover the bald spot on the back of his head.  Jack (Jeff) is the cool one, the naturally brilliant musician, who despises their gigs in chain hotel lounges, but doesn't have the courage to break out on his own.  Just as their long-term career is careening towards the pit, Susie Diamond (Pfeiffer) enters the picture and the dynamics shift.  She is a force to be reckoned with and something has got to give.

As familiar as I was with the actors, I fogot who they were almost immediately.  I suspect that the fact that these two talented Bridges brothers played the Baker  brothers has a lot to do with the success of the film.  I have to wonder how much of their actual personalities informed the performances.

The whole thing flows seamlessly.  We get the points but we're not hit over the head with them.  The ending is just-right, too!  Overall, a terrific film.",1190419200,,2615,4.730088495575221

This movie gets knocked for having minimal story and a slow-moving, predictable plot, however upon further reflection I think this works to its advantage and makes it a stronger piece.

Too many movies nowadays rely on over-the-top stories and unrealistic plot twists and the viewer loses out on an important element...  how do the characters react to every day circumstances we all face in our lives?  This movie kind of reminded me of ""Tender Mercies"" with Robert Duvall in that it was purposefully slow and predictable, but really made you think about how the characters handled the unglamorous details of their situations which is much more like real life and allows the work to make a stronger statement to the viewer.

In the Baker Boys we see how these professional musicians cope with their small time status and the compromises they make consciously or not to keep their commitments to family, their careers and their art.  There are no perfect solutions presented for the viewer and the story is left somewhat unresolved, which forces you to think how you deal with the opposing forces in your life and its inherent contradictions.  No easy answers, but this movie does an excellent job of portraying the characters reactions which seem very flawed, human and genuine.",1186963200,,1381,4.826271186440678

His handsome head of hair, his charming grin, his unbelievably sexy voice, his ....well, do I need to go on?  In ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"", we see his  nuanced character acting.  Brother Beau (also irresistable in his own way), as the responsible father-figure brother, and Michelle Pfieffer as Suzy Diamond (one of her very best roles ever), make a terrific ensemble act for what could have been an all-too-predictable story.  Who cares if it's predictable, I say?  At the end of the movie, you really don't care, because the character development in this movie is fabulous.  The acting is fabulous, and most of all, the movie score is fabulous.  Dave Grusin rules!

While most of the keyboard music in the film is provided by the great Dave Grusin, Ms Pfeiffer more than adequately holds her own both as actor and singer.  And yes her wonderfully choreographed scene atop a piano of ""Makin' Whoopee"" is in a class by itself.

""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" is a minor masterpiece of that time - and unjustly neglected.  Leonard Maltin gives it two and a half stars in his always uneven (and unreliable) movie review books.  The film, without a doubt, deserves three and a half stars - at least.  Michelle Phieffer has never been better - and her performance is superb here: sexy, sweet, tough, knowing, graceful.  She sings with real emotion and style - you wonder why she never did some kind of tour. The Bridges, Jeff and Beau, are so much in sync here, playing off each other as if they've been acting together forever, that you realize you are viewing not only a tremendously entertaining film, which it is, but also a moving and bittersweet film about finding your true voice - and your true life.  Jeff Bridges has always been underrated. He's just regularly great in everything, so I guess no one notices how fine an actor he really is. Beau, too, so superb in ""Norma Rae"", could not be more different here.  And Michelle is one of the most beautiful actresses in the history of cinema.  Is there anyone quite like her today?  Most of the actresses we now admire tend to be British. They are better actors too.  BUY this DVD, don't rent it. It's worth adding to your permanent collection.

I miss that understanding that people walking on the street in cold weather was enough to be beautiful and that sitting somewhere outside in a diner was a happy thing to do.  Everything's too advertised these days and eating a meal becomes an event (haha, Carrie Fisher in When Harry Met Sally - which was a movie that never did it for me.)  Michelle Pfeiffer gets to look what I imagined she should look like in all her earlier films when one was amazed and felt she needed to be acknowledged for that something about her.  Boy, she really puts Julia Roberts' primacy into perspective, doesn't she?  And here she is in this very nice movie that looks like your favorite dark winter coat and high heels, skin paled by the brisk wind - the contrast beautifying lips made redder by the same wind and shining eyes altogether.  Don't you know that feeling I describe?  I know some people who watched this movie over and over again.  I never could watch it again all the way through but I liked it even though on repeat viewings it didn't seem like so very much but the Bridges brothers seem really cool.  So, I don't make any promises or try to explain this movie but I recommend it because it's enjoyable and not a waste of time to see at least once the three main actors plus Jennifer Tilly when she was stealing scenes.  Despite Angelna Jolie's glamour turn, Mr. and Mrs. Smith isn't a movie with atmosphere and style, it's a movie with money and makes people want to buy cosmetics and furniture.

1390421,4,B000053GYD,"Many of this movie's fans enjoy it because of Michelle Pfeiffer's amazingly sensual performance as Susie Diamond (especially for 1989).  I enjoy it for its pretty apt depiction of life grinding out a living by making music in small clubs.  It is both a buddy/brother story and a kind of triangle as well.

Beau and Jeff Bridges play Frank and Jack Baker who have had a piano duo for a long time.  It has been pretty steady work, and maybe at one time might have even seemed on its way somewhere.  That might have been when they got the moniker of ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"".  Frank is the business manager who approaches the music as if he is running a machine shop.  Jack goes along because he is too unfocused to make a living on his own, but hates the dead repetition of the arrangements night after night, month after month, year after year.  He goes to jazz clubs after hours and once in awhile sits in with the band, but never gets enough gumption to go off on his own.  He likes causal relationships with women he doesn't know and drinking too much.

Everything about the brothers is kind of tired and run down and the name is mostly ironic.  When a club manager pays them off early to not play the brothers face a crisis and decide to get a female singer to spice things up.  The auditions are hilariously awful.  And, of course, Susie Diamond comes in late.  Her experience has been working for an escort service.  This is not realistic.  No one who sings for a living does so accidentally.  At least, not that I have seen.  Now, it is not inconceivable that a desperate singer might become an escort to make ends meet, but not one with the powerful charisma and native talent of Susie Diamond.

The impact she has on the fate of the group and their rise to moderate success is pretty well done.  There is a simmering tension between Susie and Jack, but Frank wants to keep the rules and the band on a strictly professional relationship.  What happens is pretty common in musical groups with men and women members and it has predictable effects.

This is a mood piece and the language is far rougher than it needed to be, but is actually pretty realistic.  And the amount of smoking and drinking in the film makes the film seem even more from a different time (although it seemed contemporary when the film was new).

In The Fabulous Baker Brothers, she does it all with her face, voice, and body in one of the most remembered renditions of ""Making Whoopie,"" a hallmark performance on the par with Rita Hayworth's rendition of ""Put the Blame on Mame.""

A charming story of brotherly love, it features bachelor kuul dude, Jack (Jeff Bridges) and nerdy family guy, Frank (Beau Bridges),as a middle aged piano duo who have been a performing act since children. They play the circuit of small rooms in chain motels and hotels, cocktail lounges and bars over 300 nights a year and have made a successful if unnoticed living. However, with cuts to their expected schedule, the brothers realize they must make a change and take on a sexy vocalist, Suzy Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer). Suzy is a size 6, chain-smoking, foul-mouth show-stopper beauty who cleans up well, and complicates the brother's ordered lives by asking for equal billing and her photo on the marquee card. Adding to the dilemma, Suzy knows she does not like singing ""Feelings"" night after night, or ""Bali Hi.""

Jack wants Suzy for his own duet, but not the complications of a true commitment, and, Frank just wants Suzy to not swear into the microphone. The strain of a new member into the daily grind on the road takes its toll on the brother's relationship as Suzy's presence finally awakens Jack from his complacent attitude towards his life, and Frank, to stand up for himself and their professional career.

The real life brothers, Beau, the cute one, and Jeff, the hunk, are never more true to themselves portraying brothers who long ago put their desires and needs on the back burner. These performances are subtle, mature, and nuanced and a joy to watch. Michelle Pfeiffer's presence is worth the price of admission if only to watch her writhe on the Steinway, and her vocals are her own. One of the better performances by an actress recognized for her beauty, she proves her chops and vocal talent with Suzy's quixotic mixture of tough-girl and model chic.

As a trio, the cast mesh and support each other as a musical drama with hi and low notes given the attention worthy of a concert performance. Kudos to the look of the film and costumes and settings which make an extra dry martini a real pleasure to enjoy. Hold the olives, please.",1150329600,,2436,4.765402843601896
1390424,4,B000053GYD,"The Baker Boys (Beau Bridges as Frank, Jeff Bridges as Jack) are brothers and work together as a piano duet playing the hotel circuit in Seattle. Frank is all business; Jack is the sold-out artistic one. When things are going bad they decide to take on a singer (Michelle Pfeiffer). She's a flake, but a big hit. Jack falls for her, but won't let himself go; much of the movie is about how they don't make love. He's supposed to be a great pianist who hasn't the courage to follow his artistic star; he rarely talks or shows emotion.

If this sounds like an old cliche, it is. Jack and Pfeiffer have the expected big fight near the end where she tells him off, and he responds by quitting Frank (they reconcile at the end). To me there's something very appealing in Jack's character, and I found myself riveted to him throughout the picture.

They don't make movies like that anymore nor do they produces actors & actresses like Jeff Bridges & Michelle Pfeiffer.

The movie revolves around brothers Jack and Frank Baker (Jeff & Beau Bridges) who are cocktail lounge piano players whose career has hit a sour note. They need a little charm and sex appeal to liven up their act - what they get is Susie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer), a beautiful, but hard-talking, chain-smoking songstress. The ensuing combination takes a ride through emotions, human nature & the lives of people in showbiz.

All that aside who could forget Michelle Pfeiffer looking as tantalizing as ever, as she slides across that Piano top in that slinkiest of slinky red dresses. The pause button on the DVD player is about to get a real good work out.

Academy Award Nominations: 3, including Best Actress for Michelle Pfeiffer & Best Cinematography & Editing. Golden Globe win for Best Actress & Nomination for Best Original Score.

Verdict: utterly enjoyable. It's the spirited energy that radiates from the lead performances that keeps this movie fluid. Pfeiffer especially is a revelation - and here's a part where she can do what she loves most, sing and act concurrently. Jeff Bridges also gives some of his best performances to date as her improbable suitor - together, they surprisingly, smolder in several scenes.

1390426,4,B000053GYD,"A terrific cast and a simple sweet story are some of the highlights of this unique, rarely talked about gem from the late-80's. It has every reason to be as seen as Pretty Woman--which came later, and seems to have ripped off not only the look of this film, but the poster of another lost classic, Rich Girl.
The Bridges brothers are fantastic in an extremely inspired casting gimmick, but the real reason to see this film is Michelle Pfeiffer in a Golden Globe winning and Oscar nominated role. She is superb as a sexy siren who tears apart two brothers, one a sex addict and the other a happily married man. Yes, you've heard it before but I will say it again, her rendition of ""Making Whopee"" has to be one of the most memorable scenes in all of film.
The main themes of sibling rivalry and unfulfilled talent are generally engrossing, and help to paper over the thinness of the story. Jeff Bridges is very believable as a man working in the lower ranks of his trade when he could've reached the top. Beau is also in fine form as a performer who does what he does simply because he has a family to support. It's a hard film to describe, because it's not really about very much, but if you can adjust to the relaxed pace and just enjoy the leisurely development of the three main characters then you will come away from the film feeling thoroughly satisfied.
Meg Tilly is also worth mentioning. She is fantastic in a small role that I wish was more fully developed. She is a truly wonderful and underrated actress and I was pleasantly surprised to see her. She has one of the other more memorable scenes in the film, auditioning for the brothers near the beginning of the film.

The movie focuses on the three main characters and their relationship. So you'll have a lot of talk and songs but no action at all. It's pretty rare nowadays to have on screen heroes thinking, feeling and becoming better without a single gunshot. Enjoy !
It is to be noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer sings in the FABULOUS BAKER BOYS and she's not bad at all. Furthermore, she is sexier than the average cocktail bar singer. Jeff and Beau are very good too.

As the piano-playing ""Baker Boys"" of the title, Beau and Jeff Bridges play like they're brothers -- which they are. The Baker Boys, who have seemingly forever been playing muzak-style piano, accompanying each other, and making the smallest of small talk in a two piano-act, are out of gas. So, they decide to hire a ""girl singer,"" to win back Seattle audiences ... and bookings.
The sequence in which the brothers audition would-be singers is the funniest of its kind ever filmed. But while this movie has some wonderful laughs, it is not, ultimately, a comedy.
Screenwriter-director Steve Kloves' debut is dominated by an actress named Michelle Pfeiffer, and by a sultry, smoky, saloon singer named ... Micheller Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer does all her own singing, and she's joy! (Warning: Although the wonderful soundtrack mixes Dave Grusin's cool jazz score with works from the Great American Songbook, don't buy the cd, as much of the best music is left off of it.)

Michelle Pfeiffer is in her prime as a torchlight singer in a beautiful red dress on top of a black Steinway piano.  This alone should sell the movie if you're a guy who plays the piano (such as myself).
But if that alone doesn't turn you on, there is also the interesting dynamics going on between the two brothers struggling to maintain their dignity while at the same time trying to make ends meet as jazz pianists who together comprise the ""Fabulous Baker Boys.""  They find Michelle Pfeiffer, and one of them falls in love with her.
Finally, this movie is a metaphor for mid-life crisis as the trio each in their own way confront the very real possibility that the best might be behind them, that their aspirations and achievements have flattened out and that they're over the hill.  However, they do get their moment in the sun in this movie, and the ending for this movie is wonderfully ambiguous.",1029110400,,989,4.564971751412429

The picture delighted me as it has so many times in the past--it's beautifully filmed, written, and acted.  (Michelle Pfeiffer's thrilling performance is just the icing on an already delicious cake.)  The DVD is, for the most part, a big improvement over the VHS version.  It's in widescreen, for one thing, and the digital transfer brings out so much detail in the photograpy and, especially, the performances. Pfeiffer and the Bridges brothers are wonderfully subtle actors and you can see the nuances of their acting here in a way that wasn't possible outside of a theatrical screening.  An added bonus is the audio commentary by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus.  There are, however, a couple of problems with the DVD version.  The color quality isn't the best--it seems faded in comparison with the theatrical and VHS versions.  The other is a flub in the transfer that should have been caught and corrected.  In the ""Making Whoopee"" scene, the picture at one point briefly freezes into a still image.  (It occurs directly before Pfeiffer steps down from the piano.)  As momentary as it is, it's distracting, and it has to occur, in all places, in the film's most famous scene.  It's still a great movie and the DVD is definitely worth getting even if one has the VHS version, but one wishes the releasing company had taken a little more care in preparing it before releasing it on the market.",989798400,,1483,4.7952755905511815

One day the owner of the Bakers' favorite night club suggests to them that their act is getting rather tired; they'll need something fresh, bold, and exciting to spice it up if they want to stay on top. So Frank & Jack decide to hire a singer.
After critiquing auditions from about forty-odd different women, none of whom can sing, Frank & Jack decide on Suzie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer), who arrives late for the audition but successfully convinces them she's their singer.

1390462,5,B000053GYD,"When I saw this movie over 10 years ago at the theater, Michelle Pfeiffer absolutely blew me away.  I believe that I had heard some movie reviewer say something like Pfeiffer puts the Fabulous into the Baker Boys, and she  positively does.
If you are remotely a Michelle Pfeiffer fan, then you  should see this movie.  She is absolutely incredible.  The scene in the  movie that is worth five stars by itself is where Suzie Diamond(Pfeiffer)  is singing Makin' Whoopie on top of the piano.  It is just way to hot for  words.
Even though Pfeiffer steals every scene that she is in, Jeff and  Beau Bridges do a great job as a pair of piano playing brothers, who have  had a lounge act over 15 years.
The movie focuses more on the trials and  tribulations of Jack(Jeff Bridges).  He is at a crossroads in his life.  Should he stay with his brother, Frank(Beau Bridges) in the comfortable  lounge act that they have had, or should he pursue his passion for playing  jazz?  Frank had always been comfortable doing the same act, because he had  a family to feed.
When the brothers feel like their act is getting into  a rut, they decide that they need to hire a female singer.  After going  through the process of listening to all of these different women, they  finally decide to go with Suzie Diamond(Michelle Pfeiffer).  When she  finally gets adjusted to the act, Suzie shines.
What Suzie does for Jack  is to open the door for him to realize that he needs to take a chance with  his life and follow his passion.  In the meantime, Suzie becomes interested  in Jack and even though Frank is telling Jack to stay away from Suzie  personally, Jack simply cannot resist.
Jack eventually does make the hard  transition of breaking with his brother.  Jeff and Beau Bridges do an  excellent job in some scenes that explore the dynamic of sibling  relationships.
One of the best things about this movie is the soundtrack.  Dave Grusin does a wonderful job with the score.  In fact, I think that he  should have won the Oscar for it.  Michelle Pfeiffer's voice is absolutely  incredible.  On the soundtrack, she sings Makin' Whoopee and My Funny  Valentine.  No one will ever sing these songs as well as she does.
The  Fabulous Baker Boys is a very adult film, so I would not recommend it for  children at all.  But, for the adult music lover, I would definitely see  it.",964310400,,2360,4.54066985645933
1390463,5,B000053GYD,"How do you attempt to write a review for one of your favorite films? I  fondly recall The Fabulous Baker Boys as a cinematic highlight in my life,  and know that the following review will probably not do it justice, but  well....
In his debut feature, writer-director Steven Kloves' took some  very old plot-lines and with care, skill and sheer respect for the film  medium, created a minor masterpiece which bears up to repeated viewing and  guarantees hours of endless entertainment - trust me, I've seen this film  so many times, it's embarrassing to reveal the exact number.
For 31  years, Frank and Jack Baker have played piano together. Child stars turned  lounge lizards, the two peddle their middle-of-the-road tunes in any bar  they can book. Times are tough, and the once fabulous act has grown tired,  hackneyed and somewhat embarrassing, especially for younger brother Jack  (Jeff Bridges), who's embittered and weary of the muzak he plays, the  dead-end life he leads. Older brother Frank (Beau Bridges) sees their act  as a business, a means of supporting his wife and children, something to do  in order to survive. Unlike Jack, Frank has no dreams of musicality and,  quite honestly, he's a hack who doesn't really like what he does, but who  is content to keep on doing it.
As the duo hit a particularly lean  patch, they decide to take on a singer to spice up their act, and after a  hilarious montage of terrible wannabes (including a particularly inspired  Jennifer Tilly), the dubiously named Suzie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer)  slinks into their lives and so begins a happy professional collaboration  that garners them success, respect and a small measure of fame. Personally,  however, Suzie's arrival marks the beginning of the end for Frank and Jack.  An ex-social escort too proud to tell the many tearful tales she has, she's  a kindred soul for Jack, two cynical losers who may have a chance at  happiness.
Things turn sour when a commitment phobic Jack bails on  Suzie, and she leaves the act. The Baker brothers are reduced again to  small-time acts, and in a particularly demeaning engagement, Jack and  Frank's long seething resentment and frustrations come to the surface. When  the dust settles, each goes his own way, their relationship changed but  intact. The question is, would Jack ever stand a chance with Suzie?
This  film is a smoldering scorcher, packed with pitch perfect performances and a  script that is as surprisingly deft as its ideas are old and unoriginal.  Steven Kloves' dialogue is music to the ears. He expertly captures the tone  and mood of the characters, and crystallizes years of hurt, longing and  pain in short, succinct sentences that speak volumes. Using a confident,  sure hand, he steers his sleepy, slow-burn script to classic status. The  pace is just right, and the languid charm the film possesses is one of its  greatest assets.
Of course, much of the film's credit must also go to  the actors, all of whom are flawless. The top-lining brothers give  career-high performances in this film. Beau embodies the domesticated  suburban quality which defines Frank so fully that it is hard to imagine  him as being any different in real life. Although a somewhat pathetic  character, Beau nonetheless finds the dignity and respectability in Frank  and it is his clear and honest portrayal of these qualities which make his  story so much more poignant and touching than it appears on paper. If there  were a ""sad"" life amongst the trio of leads, Frank's would be the  saddest simply because he's chosen to be oblivious to his own  disappointments and regrets - the price of fatherhood and of being a  husband and provider have forced his hands and shaped his life, and Beau's  performance, made up of small revealing gestures and silent looks tells the  whole story behind the man.
As Jack, Jeff Bridges again turns in a  startling portrait of a man gone wrong fighting his way back. Jack Baker  has talent, and he knows it; he sticks with Frank because he's lazy, but  also because deep down inside, he's fearful of taking the chance and not  having anyone to blame should he fail. Everything about Jeff's performance  speaks of Jack's abject misery, anger and the restlessness that's always  chafing against him. Not only does he look the part, he seems to become the  character. It is hard to imagine another actor being able to so fully play  the part with the same level of complexity, depth of emotion and  completeness. It helps tremendously, as well, that he lights up the screen  beautifully opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in a career-altering role.
Long  relegated to window dressing or showing up in undeserving projects,  Pfeiffer's career suffered a major setback due to her involvement in Grease  2. With Sweet Liberty and Into the Night, however, her luck began to  change; when The Witches of Eastwick came along, she became a newly-minted  star. The Fabulous Baker Boys, however, gave her credibility. As the sexy  siren who wreaks havoc in the lives of two brothers, she's a modern-day  Lauren Bacall, sensual, intelligent and bruised. Pfeiffer's Oscar-nominated  performance here is stunning; there's not a moment where she makes a wrong  move or wanders into shaky terrain, and she completes the incredibly  realized triangle that Kloves' script has engineered.
The scene of  Pfeiffer crooning ""Makin' Whoopee"" whilst lolling about on top of  a baby grand piano is often sited as the highlight of modern cinema this  film offers. I suggest an alternative: the scene where Suzie makes her  stage debut with the Baker boys. Nervous but too tough to admit it, she  drops her cue cards, swears colorfully into the microphone and gropes about  for a recovery. A frantic Frank then forces a bemused Jack into an  impromptu duet of ""Ten Cents A Dance"" before Suzie returns in  fine form and the three of them begin to make lounge music history. As it  plays, this scene is amusing, and arguably slight, but the subtext of three  desperate souls relying on each other, clinging onto the shreds of dignity  they are left with in order to make a shot at something better, and  succeeding, is both exhilarating and melancholic. The audience knows that  before they go on the stage, the act was nothing; when they leave, they  would begin the journey of success and eventually falling apart. The time  on that stage was the one moment everything was perfect for them. In a  canny and sublime way, The Fabulous Baker Boys captures this magical  tension and wonder amongst them, and sustains it for its entire duration.
This is one the best films you'll ever see. Trust me on this.",961027200,,6649,4.884304932735426
1390474,5,B000053GYD,"Written and directed by Steve Kloves, ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" is a tale of music and brotherly love set in Seattle.  The Baker boys are Jack and Frank (real life brothers Jeff and Beau Bridges), who eke out a living  playing piano together at various venues throughout the Emerald City, a  basic lounge act they've been doing for fifteen years.  Frank is the  responsible one, because he has to be; he has a wife, kids and a home in  the suburbs.  He manages their business, secures the bookings and is  content to stick with a formula that works.  For him, it's not about the  music, it's about keeping food on the table for those who depend on him.  Jack, on the other hand, is unattached and could care less about the  business end of the partnership.  As long as it affords him a modicum of  security as well as dignity, he is more than willing to just go along for  the ride.  For Jack, though, underneath it all, it is about the  music; it's about jazz.  On off nights he will steal away alone to some  small club to play, and deep down inside he knows that this is not only  what he really wants, but needs.  And he knows he could be great, if only  he'd let himself go.  The trouble is, he's been with Frank his whole life,  and as long as the act is working he just can't make the break.  Unless  something happens, his dreams are destined to remain suppressed and  unrealized.  It is only when one of their regular clubs balks at  rescheduling them that the brothers begin to realize that perhaps their act  is getting a bit stale.  So they decide to try adding a singer to the act.  After a memorable scene in which a number of young hopefuls are auditioned,  Suzie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer) enters their life.  She joins the act on  a trial basis, and after an amusing and somewhat tentative beginning,  infuses it with new life, though Frank continues to adamantly resist too  much of a departure from their original show.  (""Does anyone really want to  hear `Feelings' again?"" she asks him at one point).  Ultimately, however,  Suzie becomes the impetus for change that Jack has needed all along, and  the stage is set for the decisive moment, which comes when the dignity of  the brothers is compromised due to an incident on Frank's part of  uncharacteristic carelessness.  When Jack tells Frank, ""We've never been  clowns before-"" you know exactly how deep it has cut.  Kloves has  fashioned an entertaining study of relationships, change, and the effects  of complacent loyalty and self-denial; and the importance of following your  own heart.  When Jack sits down alone at the piano in that smoke-filled  club, we know that this is where he is meant to be.  Filmed on location in  and around Seattle, with a terrific score by Dave Grusin,a supporting cast  that includes Jennifer Tilly (Monica) and Ellie Raab (Nina), and a classic  scene in which Suzie Diamond croons ""Makin' Whoopee"" atop a piano, ""The  Fabulous Baker Boys"" is an absolute gem you do not want to miss.",955324800,,2993,4.583650190114068
