7456589,4,B0164W5NXG,"Hi Gang, I had a friend who purchased the P90X.  I borrowed it, and gave it a slow run for about 2 weeks.  That was way to advanced, and I needed to find something that could lay the foundation prior to going at the P90X.  I loved Tony Horton from 90X, and liked the way the workouts seemed to be very thought out.  I purchased the Pro 90 from [...], and must say this is perfect.  I have had 12 workouts so far, and can see and feel the results.  Comes with 2 discs, 1 disc to get you started, and the second disc when you're ready to kick it up a notch.  The abb routines are great.  The kick, and boxing sessions that have been incorporated are excellent.  If you know you won't be ready for P90X, then I suggest this DVD set.",1255910400,8,729,4.006944444444445
7456590,4,B0164W5NXG,"I purchased this series after getting P90X because I was able to do the weight training but cardio vascularly I was way out of shape for the cardio workouts. I used the 3-4 sweat and ab ripper 200 and excelled in a few weeks to use the P90X Kempo and Cardio X. I am now using the Sculpt 3-4 when I just do feel up to the P90X grueling weight routines.
  This is a very solid program and if one USES it, the problem I feel most people have with exercise programs-they don't use them, you WILL make gains in ALL areas of fitness. The description is misleading as there are 6 workouts in the series. Sweat 1-2 and 3-4, Sculpt 1-2 and 3-4, Abs ripper 100 and 200 and these are good graduated progressions. I would probably warm up a little more with some cardio before the Sculpt, something Tony includes in P90X, and I would include stretching also. With that said I still highly recommend this series it is a great bang for the buck especially on this 2 DVD set. The best to you and your health...JB",1224288000,51,997,4.242105263157895
7456591,4,B0164W5NXG,"I purchased The Power90 dvd to be able to have cardio and stength training in one. It's a great work-out,the cardio portion is tough but doable and you're done before you know it! The strength portion is 28 minutes of weight training. Tony takes you through it quickly but you know you are working those muscles!! I recommend this to anyone wanting to get a good workout in the comfort of your home. No gym required to get a good work-out!

7456592,4,B0164W5NXG,good fitness dvd. I see a difference after about 1 week of doing the workouts everyday.,1206057600,3,87,4.5
7456593,3,B0164W5NXG,"I bought this video to start working out and thi9s video was just a little too hard for me to keep up with, It would be good for more advanced people.",1377302400,,150,3.870967741935484
7456594,5,B0164W5NXG,"I totally recommend this workout. I started on it because I wanted to lose 20 pounds and shape/tone up. Had to struggle thru the first few days since I was really out of shape and had never EVER worked out in my life before but after that It was actually fun.  After that first week you start to look forward to workout time.  It includes 2 half-hour sessions.  I started with completing just one of them for about a month and then combined both.  It does take me more than half hour to complete since I pause a few times but as Tony says, "" that's ok"".  It's easy and straight forward and OMG YOU DO GET RESULTS!  but you have to COMMIT.  I've been doing this workout for almost 10 weeks (missed a few days here n there) and eating healthy.  I've lost 15 pounds, toned up quite a bit and feel GREAT!!! As I mentioned before, The first few days, you might feel exhausted quickly or feel like you can't do it, but please take breaks as needed and DON'T GET DISCOURAGED BECAUSE IT DOES WORK and you WILL build up the energy to complete a whole session in just a week!! so again, great product and I absolutely recommend it.",1373241600,,1121,4.230046948356808
7456595,5,B0164W5NXG,my wife like this dvd and even my sister in law they have others  tony horton dvds but this is all in one and they can take it when go out of town to keep with they workout.,1370908800,,173,3.5526315789473686
7456596,4,B0164W5NXG,Powerful workout in one DvD. Doesn't clutter up one's library of DVDs. Using Power 90 as directed and you will have a Beach Body in no time at all.,1369008000,,147,4.103448275862069
7456597,5,B0164W5NXG,This work out is NOT long but it is very good because you get both cardio and resistance. I strongly recommend it to anyone who is not ready for P90x. P90 is great.,1368144000,,164,4.0
7456598,5,B0164W5NXG,Losing weight already with just this disc. This is an up tempo work out. But easier than most to keep up with. Wich is better 4 your mind set to feel like u r accomplishing something. Do this awhile then graduate to harder stuff..great starting point workout,1361836800,,258,4.51063829787234
7456599,5,B0164W5NXG,"It was great, worked my entire body from head to my toes. I love it and I love the ab ripper!!",1360713600,,94,3.5238095238095237
7456600,4,B0164W5NXG,"It is a good workout, still a little more advanced than I thought, but I'm out of shape.  Glad I didn't get the more extensive one. I can do some of the workouts, not all of them.",1356393600,,179,3.8378378378378377
7456601,5,B0164W5NXG,"I did this program at 41 and I am thankful a friend introduced it to me.  Though I was a high school athlete, for years I'ved worked behind a desk and over the years I'd slipped further and further into lousy shape,...overweight, tired and back problems.  Further and further from what I considered 'me.'  The great thing about the program was that from my own home I could do it around whatever times I could dedicate to it.  No driving anywhere or making a class time.  I didn't follow a meal plan but the added exercise helped me lose (and keep off) about 11lbs.  My push-ups went from a max of 18 to 38 in 90 days.  I think the Power Yoga was a great learning for me as now that I've moved on to Yoga X (part of the P90x program) I was partially ramped up to a big change for me as I'd never done Yoga before this.  The main complaint I hear is boredom with repetition but for an uncoordinated fellow like myself, I enjoyed simple moves that worked me hard.  I was always drenched in sweat by the end.  If you want a program to work you from head to toe and see improvements in all areas of fitness I think this is a fantastic starter program.  It was a life saving find for me.",1349136000,2,1182,4.117903930131004
7456602,3,B0164W5NXG,"Tony Horton seems very male oriented. His banter kind of annoys me. He doesn't seem to have any method behind his workouts other than ""muscle confusion"", which seems like a fancy way of saying I do whatever because I don't have any science behind my routines. It's ok for a burn, but I think Jillian Michaels is a far better trainer.",1323129600,,333,4.475409836065574
7456603,5,B0164W5NXG,This is an awesome workout and it actually works!!  I've had people ask me what gym I went to - the results were amazing!  I would recommend this product!!,1305763200,2,155,4.310344827586207
7456604,5,B0164W5NXG,Tony Horton provides another good workout. He motivates and offers modified workout instructions. Power90 is a good introduction to move advance workouts such as P90X. Good workout DVD that has 3 good workouts!!!,1302998400,,212,5.454545454545454
7456605,4,B0164W5NXG,"I come to this DVD a little backwards.  Several years ago I did the P90X workout and, though I lifted weights pretty heavy some years prior, got myself in the best shape of my life in my late 30s.

Graduated to Sean T's Insanity workouts and got about 3/4 of the way through it before work interfered.

Dabbled in a P90X/Insanity hybrid then after that until a back injury in November of 2010 knocked me out of the game.  It's March and I am slowly on the mend.

We had picked this DVD up on a whim in a thrift store, mostly out of fun and for conversation material.

However, I am not ready for P90X again and decided to give this a whirl.  I must say I am pleasantly surprised.  While it lacks the ""hardcore"" elements (e.g. pullups and plyo) I learned to love in P90X, I can already tell this will get me back in the game.

Trace elements of what would become P90X are found here, Tony's commentary included.  These programs are each roughly half an hour, which is just the right amount of time when life is hectic, and results will come quickly but you have to push yourself.

The sculpt program, as many have commented, is an excellent muscle building routine and can get your muscles popping, but only if you push yourself.

The Ab Ripper is an effective ab workout with only a few moves.  No need to do hundreds of crunches.

The cardio portion is an good workout but I can already tell there are limits to how far this will take you.  This is probably because of where I've been.  For someone just starting I'm certain this will whip your cardio into shape.

Overall, just three weeks in, I am already seeing results again (amazing how much is lost in five months of inactivity...), regaining strength and flexibility and look forward to gearing up for P90X (or whatever else comes down the pike).

Great for starters or for intermediate fitness folks who are looking to change up the game.",1301788800,8,1897,4.417867435158501
7456606,5,B0164W5NXG,I was so skeptical about a workout video.  It totally works though!  Follow the workouts on the days that you are suppose to and follow the meal plans too.  I saw amazing results!,1292803200,,179,4.363636363636363
7456607,5,B0164W5NXG,"this is the best work out in my view and I will tell you about my progress.
I was 217 lbs and after using this work out for 12 weeks I weighed 195 lbs and was in incredible shape.
previously I ordered many other work outs on dvd's but found out I was unable to perform the routines as it involved ridiculous amounts of repitition that resulted in incredible muscle pain especially doing squats and stuff.

with power 90 i was very skeptical when I ordered it and the first couple of days I just watched the dvd's evaluating if I would be able to do the work out or not. my first thought was it didn't look bad at all and when I started working out lo and behold I was able to finish the work out start to finish. I was slow at the start and gradually progressed. Keep in mind I HAD NEVER WORKED OUT IN MY LIFE and this was the first time I got a work out video after watching the infomercials at 2 in the nite.

I noticed change after three weeks. my muscles started firming up and my waist started shrinking down. I didn't order any supplements but did use multivitamins available OTC. one thing that is absolutely necessary is to keep the diet under control
this program will only work for those who believe in cutting down portions of the food and eating healthy.

recently i have been under a lot of stress and ended up gaining the weight back but guess what i know what worked for me in the past and I believe will work for me again so here i am ordering these dvd's again and thought I give you guys my review of this work out.

when they claim 90 days will change the way you look, I believe its the best 90 days you will ever invest in your body and the results will speak for themselves when you are done. it will change your entire outlook on life when u feel healthy and become part of the healthy clan.

good luck

7456608,4,B0164W5NXG,"I started this program 35 days ago after gaining 50lbs. in a year and a half. I had a very active job, but had to quit after a severe digestive problem cause a huge muscle loss, and I could no longer do my job without destroying my knee. I was having severe Acid-reflux, and decided that something had to change.  I changed my diet, and started walking, and loss 20 lbs. in about 2 months. Then I added power 90, and let me say that I had been a power lifter, before another severe illness robbed me of a LOT of my muscle 4 years ago. So when I couldn't even do the push-up part of the sculpting program, I realized how far down I had fallen, as I had been able to do many sets of 100 push-ups at a time.  No matter, I pushed those negative thoughts out of the way, and started to get busy, and in a month's time. I have lost 30 MORE pounds!!! I also swim 30min, to an hour every night(Breast stroke), and I am walking 3-5 miles a night. Now before this program, I couldn't walk that far, or even walk up and down a staircase without using the handrail because of my knee, but now I can even run to catch a bus, which was impossible before!!  I can do piked shoulder push-ups and Hindu push-ups now, which I do after I finish the sculpting program, and I can do Hindu squats after the cardio set.  So if you're thinking about getting this program, forget all the other negative whining critiques, about how bored they are, or how one of the workouts is too easy, FORGET THAT STUFF! Realize that the intensity is UP TO YOU!!! If it's too easy, step it up a notch and do more reps, too hard? slow it down a bit. BORED? Who cares princess?!! This ISN'T a birthday clown or a 100 million dollar movie!  JUST TURN ON YOUR FAVORITE EXCITING MUSIC, PRESS PLAY, and do the work!!!  THIS program WORKS, IF YOU DO THE WORK!!!  You'll figure out that Tony sometimes loses track of the number of reps 'cuz he's instructing, so just adjust, don't whine, and you'll be fine. Exercise is about self-discipline, and if you need a push, this program will give you a nice, friendly shove!  P.S., Oh, if you're thinking you're too old, I turn 47 next Saturday!!!",1280793600,9,2143,4.235294117647059
7456609,4,B0164W5NXG,"I am on my second round of Power 90 before I head into the P90X or Masters series. I find Power 90 to be a reasonably strenuous workout, comprising circuit/weight training followed by yoga/cardio. Each day can be done in an hour, and by the time you finish, you know you have worked out. People started noticing a difference in my physique within 30-40 days, and the improvements continued throughout the cycle.

A few caveats - if you want to make continuous progress, buy a set of bands or dumbbells separate so you can progress your weights upward. The 90 days of essentially 4 workouts (30 days of the 1-2 series and 60 of the 3-4 series) make for a bit of boredom and repetition. You essentially switch back and forth each day between cardio and circuit - and man, after 60 days, you know every Tony Hortonism, joke, cadence and gaffe.

A good program if you follow it, and can get past the repetitive nature of it.",1269734400,5,920,4.470238095238095
7456610,4,B0164W5NXG,"Some of the reviews here aren't reviewing the Power90 workout. Power90 has ONE DVD.  Check Amazon's description of the product.  It says there is ONE DVD. The DVD has: SCULPT Circuit 1-2, SWEAT Cardio 1-2 and AB RIPPER 100.  That's it.  I like this video, and am getting a lot out of it.  But there is no fat burner DVD, and no Sculpt/Sweat versions 3-4, just the 1-2 versions.  Fine with me.  It's a good video.",1269302400,4,412,4.342105263157895
7456611,4,B0164W5NXG,"I have had many workout DVDs over the years and this has been by far one of my favorites. The ""Sculpt"" portion of the DVD is what I keep going back to. I have a gym membership which I use almost daily so for myself I found the ""Sweat"" portion not as effective as most of the cardio machines I use at the gym. I can't say that I found anything special about the ""Ab Ripper"" section of the DVD. Personally, I am able to get an effective workout at the gym for cardio and abs but have always struggled with sculpting. I found that the ""Sculpt"" portion of this DVD is just what I need to complete my workout routine. Compared to other DVDs that help sculpt or tone this one is easy to follow, can easily be modified for time or personal fitness level and time efficient. I purchased this back in 2005 and have yet to find a better and faster DVD for Sculpting. However, I can't quite say the same for the other aspects of the DVD which is why I am only giving this 4 stars.",1268784000,2,969,4.0785340314136125
7456612,2,B0164W5NXG,"I want to be completely clear that this product IS a quality product and the Beachbody workouts are quite effective in my opinion.  I just believe this particular DVD is grossly overpriced when you consider the other options available from Beachbody.  For example, their Power 90 In Home Boot Camp Kit (I believe that's the name) is less than $10 more than this single DVD.  That kit actually contains more than twice as many workouts, plus it comes with a resistance band and nutrition guides.  The Boot Camp Kit is by far a better value and likely a more productive workout plan for someone that wants to push their body as hard as possible for the full 90 days.  It seems silly that Beachbody would put out this DVD and price it at nearly the same price as the Boot Camp Kit when these same workouts are included with the Boot Camp Kit.  What if someone scratches or loses their phase I-II DVD from the Boot Camp Kit?  Should they really have to shell out nearly the same amount of money it would cost to buy the entire kit a second time?  That appears to be the only choice, and that seems ridiculous.  This DVD shouldn't be over $30 at the absolute most.  The high price makes it appear as though Beachbody is trying to push people in to purchasing the Boot Camp Kit or the P90X plan, even in the event that they just need a single replacement disc.",1265068800,6,1354,4.38
