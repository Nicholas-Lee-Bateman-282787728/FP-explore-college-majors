8738436,5,B00C9D7WAC,"RIVERKEEPERS MAKE QUITE A SPLASH ON EARTH DAY

By ERIC MINK, Daily News TV Critic

At first glance, the film seems to be an admiring documentary about Riverkeepers, a citizens' group that patrols the Hudson keeping tabs on pollution, and its leaders Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and John Cronin and author/reporter/fisherman Robert H. Boyle.

But the film, written, produced and directed to fine effect by executive producer Les Guthman, turns out to be more than that. Beautifully photographed and delicately edited, the film uses the history of environmental activism on the Hudson (and other rivers) to show how individuals can have a real impact on their communities, especially when they coalesce into clear-thinking groups backed by the force of law.

Perhaps the most dramatic elements of the film are the stark contrasts between scenes shot along the river today and those included in excerpts from a 1966 CBS News documentary, ""The Majestic, Polluted Hudson."" Among those interviewed at the time by Walter Cronkite was Robert F. Kennedy, then the U.S. senator from New York.",1365984000,,1076,5.166666666666667
