8149908,1,B000JCDTY8,"If you want to see what Mr. Harding looked like before he died then you can buy this.
But if you want to know what he taught buy his books.  This DVD is poorly produced, boring,
and will probably inspire almost no one...  Douglas was a great teacher whose books speak best for him.",1259884800,,281,4.185185185185185

8149910,5,B000JCDTY8,"This 60-minute talk by Douglas Harding makes very very clear his teaching and discovery on seeing the truth of our original nature.
One can read all his books but hearing it from the horse's mouth is the best and simplest!",1207267200,4,222,4.575
