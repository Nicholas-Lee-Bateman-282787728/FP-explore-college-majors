8172552,4,B000MV8A6I,"This is just half of the excellent series ""Crusade in the Pacific"".  It is
excellently done.  I think this series was produced back in the 50's.  The
box says it was reproduced by Timeless Media Group in 2006.  If you surf
around you can get all 24 episodes on 4 or 5 discs, this series has two
discs and 10 episodes.  It is a good buy and is well done. You won't go wrong
if you can get it for $5 like I did.",1299715200,2,409,3.8214285714285716
