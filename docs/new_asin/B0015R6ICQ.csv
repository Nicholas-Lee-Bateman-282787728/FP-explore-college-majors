8259616,5,B0015R6ICQ,"Incredibly illuminating views on the Nataraja, the deep significance of the symbolism and practical applications. Douglas Brooks is a wonderful lecturer, making the complex seem simple with a great warm style filled with humour. I chuckle out loud! Not exactly what you'd expect in an Eastern philosophy course...Highly recommended.",1294099200,,332,5.795918367346939
8259617,5,B0015R6ICQ,"This is a live recording of what seems to have been a series of lectures, most likely given at Yoga Kula in Berkeley. I find Douglas Brooks' lectures insightful and his elliptical style of story telling a good fit for my own elliptical style of story processing. He interprets familiar myths in a manner that is so authentically unique that you wonder if he is making it up. He repeatedly tells you he is not making anything up, as he has heard this concern before. But if he is lying, he would be greater yet! His interpretations come from a Tantric perspective. Tantra is ill understood and often feared and largely shunned in India by the more ""mindlessly chaste"" Hindus (a category in which I would place nearly all of my own relatives). Tantra is understood even less in the West, but in contrast to India, Tantra in the West presents a more erotic face. All the more (fractal) reason to contemplate this story.

This lecture is a meditation on Nataraja, the Lord of the Dance. It is also a feast of recursive story telling. Before Douglas will tell you about Nataraja, he will get you to close circuits in your mind that you have been building all your life. For example, the aspect of Shiva as the riddler brings to mind occasions when one answers a question with a riddle to induce or prolong a journey of discovery. And there are two other aspects of Shiva to contemplate in these four discs. About half way through disc two you finally learn that, Shiva and Vishnu, in the form of a handsome ascetic couple, bring erotic asceticism to jolt the ""Pine Forest Sages"" and their wives into recognizing themselves in a new light. But at first the attraction is transgressive and so loathing sets in and then hostility in a futile effort to rid oneself of oneself. Douglas, the Harvard Ph. D. in Tantric Shaivism, (yes such things happen), is on a romp as he contrasts handsome Shiva, clothed in serpents, dropping in on paradise, bearing eroticism, to induce humans into (re)cognizing each other and then blessing them with an impromptu performance of the blissful dance of AnandaTandava, with, (gasp), the Biblical story of paradise lost. No wonder there are so few Christians in India.

As Douglas himself says, he is an acquired taste. You may do better sitting with him in person in a gathering but this CD (not DVD) is not a bad place to start and you will get to pause the story at will. You have surely tossed away $40.00 on many far less meaningful things in your life.

Now for some technical gripes. The CD track data has not been entered into Gracenotes. So if you try to import the CD into your own digital library, neither Apple nor Windows based programs recognize the content. The CD ID seems to be shared with other obscure self help material. The imported tracks show up as a garbled mishmash of English and Japanese tracks. What a shame! Then again maybe this is a modern day manifestation of the Tantric penchant for hiding secrets in plain sight. On that note, look up his other recordings, none of which show up on Amazon, to learn about the goddess Uma(OOOOHHH-MAAAAH).",1278288000,4,3095,4.623636363636364
