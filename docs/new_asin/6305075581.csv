968449,1,6305075581,"I only give this movie one star because that is as low as the ratings scale goes. If it were up to me, I would give this movie a negative rating. It was so bad, in fact, that I couldn't watch it all the way through to the end, although I tried. Why, you may ask, did I purchase this DVD in the first place? Here is my reason: I bought it because I wanted to see if a girl I had dated in college in the early 1970's was indeed one of the extras in the 'film'. I had been in love with Donna Lederer while I attended college with her in Queens,NY and she had always told me that she aspired to be a movie actress. We parted our ways and lost touch in the early 1970's. To make a short story long, here it is 2006 and I just typed her name into the Google Search Engine and lo and behold, her names comes up in the movie data base as an extra in 'Lust For Freedom'. In fact, they did not even bother to give her role a name: she is listed as 'Donna' played by Donna Lederer. Still, I had to be sure it was her, so I got the DVD and watched it. Fortunately for me, her part comes in the first half of the movie and as I watched I saw that it was indeed her, Donna, the girl I'd been in love with a long time ago. After seeing her in her acting debut, I felt sadness: she had a couple of lines and screams as she was abused by a sadistic female prison guard. Not a very auspicious beginning to an acting career. I searched the internet to see if she'd had any other and better roles since then, but alas, that was the only listing for her. I can only say that I hope that life has been better and kinder to Donna than that bit part in the movie. Wherever she is these days, I sincerely hope Donna is faring well and finding fulfillment.",1173052800,2,1730,3.876056338028169
968450,4,6305075581,"Greetings From Tromaville!!
By now, the most devoted Troma fan knows all about Eric Louzil. He is among the greatest of Troma directors, and he does not let us loyal Tromites down with this gem, ""Lust For Freedom"".
A former cop who is trying to find herself is framed for possession and is taken to a female prison. Overall, it is a laughably bad movie that boasts a wonderfully cliche' soundtrack done by 80's hair band Grim Reaper.
If you want to see one of Troma's camp classics, check out ""Lust For Freedom""! Also check out ""Fortress of Amerikkka"", ""Class of Nuke 'Em High 2: Subhumanoid Meltdown"", and ""Nuke 'Em High 3"" which were also done by Eric Louzil.

969361,3,6305075581,"This is a women-in-prison movie produced far after these movies had seen their heyday, which in itself isn't a bad thing. But this doesn't give us anything different than movies 10 and 15 years older gave us much better. In fact it doesn't give it to us as well.

The best thing that this has going for it is several full-frontal close-up nude scenes (female of course). Nothing explicit, but these still are good to see. Unfortunately they aren't nearly as frequent as they should be to make up for the lack of nudity throughout the rest of the film. Sure, there's nudity, but it's somewhat sparing for a WIP film. Also the women aren't particularly attractive, especially the lead (who herself never disrobes).

The brutality is pretty light--I for one don't complain about that. The sex is pretty much non-existent.

Overall, just not a great movie but probably pretty standard for Troma.",1400198400,8,891,4.810457516339869

969364,4,6305075581,"I am a fan of Women In Prison movies, especially the Pam Grier ones, and Lust For Freedom belongs among the finest in this category. Why? Because it has guts, no shying away from disturbing scenes (TROMA is good at this), and it just has that nice b-movie feel to it that was perfect for Up All Night when it was on the USA Network, though edited. I also love the music by Grim Reaper even if overplayed - ""Lust For Freedom"" and ""Rock You To Hell"".
My favorite character is Jud the bad boy Indian because he is just so stereotypical and outrageous.
Some parts are indeed lagging, but it gets back to the action soon enough.
I highly recommend this movie for those who like their b-movies to go the distance and also for those, like me, who are bored with TOXIE getting all the attention in TROMA movies. For additional TOXIE-relief, I also recommend the original ""Class Of Nuke Em High"".",1369094400,12,887,4.414634146341464
