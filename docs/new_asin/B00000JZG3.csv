Great Video for the young child...it's the first time I found a horse video that wasn't instructional.  This video was a real find for us...with all the mass marketted products out there it was great to find something every bit as fun and musical without the ""must buy"" products and advertising.  We live in a suburb with limited access to horses and this was a great way to introduce them to her without the expense of lessons... we found it humerous too as parents...of course now on it's 100th (or more) showing I know too much of it by heart...ugh!",986428800,,718,4.5
7913887,4,B00000JZG3,"I received both All Things Horses videos as a gift for my daughter  recently.  She loves it.  I just read the very negative review entered by a  fella from California, and I think he must have been watching a different  video.  All the other reviews are very positive, so this guy must be on  another planet.  The videos I watched were clearly intended for young  viewers and new horse lovers.  There were sections on saddling up,  different breeds of horses, the history of horses, and even an MTV type of  section that cleverly used black and white footage to represent old time  movies.  The music was excellent and as advertised, my daughter has watched  the both videos often and has become very attached to Henry the Horse.  clearly, the negative review was written by an experienced horseperson, and  not someone in the intended audience.",968198400,9,845,4.756944444444445
7913888,2,B00000JZG3,"My young daughter enjoys most of this video but I was greatly disappointed.  First, the video has a long (5-10 minutes) segment showing black and white shots from old movies.  These shots tell you nothing about horses and my daughter lets me know when I need to fast-forward.  Also, the  video description says it covers all aspects of horses and horse ownership  but it fails to show you the different breeds and colors of horses (it  touches on colors VERY briefly), it shows ""western"" riding as  only rodeoing (and it shows old clips from the '60s for that!), it fails to  show you the different gaits (walk, trot, canter, etc), and it doesn't  discuss the different grooming tools, saddles, etc.  I was expecting a  video that would show you how to brush your horse, saddle it, etc.  The  format was different - various children answering questions about horses -  but not necessarily giving any right answers!  And lastly, the video spent  way too much time talking about where horses go to the bathroom!  Oh  yeah, it gave about 6 references to their website - who needs that?",959040000,10,1082,4.695187165775401
7913889,4,B00000JZG3,"after getting the first video, All Things Horses for my kids for Christmas, I decided to get them the followup, All Things Horses 2.  It is a continuation of the first video, and just as fun.  Recommended for kids  under 8, but i liked it too.",956534400,3,243,4.239130434782608
7913890,5,B00000JZG3,"Directors Note: As the Director of this production I wanted to express our sincerest pride and enthusiasm for the final products...All Things Horses and All Things Horses 2.  A great deal of time and thought went into  creating a product that would not only be entertaining but educational.  We  involved highly trained and talented people in the making of this video and  a huge emphasis was placed on not only being funny and accurate, but being  safe.  Horses, although beautiful, smart and highly trainable animals are  also unpredictable.  We felt it was important to emphasize those aspects  without beating it into the ground.  You will notice all of our actors use  proper safety approved equipment.  We feel that kids learn by example and  it is important those examples show the correct safety methods.  This is  the age that children learn from television and they pick up on subtle  behavior cues.  With this in mind our aim was to produce a video that was  not only silly and educational but one that demonstrated good safety  techniques...showing that being safe does not get in the way or look dorky.  We hope you and your children enjoy this silly introduction to the lovable  horses.  Happy Horsing Around!  Laura Douglas",944611200,15,1238,4.898058252427185
