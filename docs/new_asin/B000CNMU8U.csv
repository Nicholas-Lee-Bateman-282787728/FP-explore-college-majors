8099807,5,B000CNMU8U,"I found this DVD to be particularly helpful as someone new to beekeeping.  For me, reading about beekeeping did not allow me the visual component I needed to ""see"" what people were talking about.  By seeing it on this DVD, I was able to answer some of my questions.

Did a great job talking about basic hive management, honey collection, and other basic aspects.

Did not address how to minimize swarming and disease management.  I share this not as a critique but simply as an observation.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking to get into beekeeping, desires to go the more natural route, and likes the idea of having a top bar hive.",1304812800,,651,4.521367521367521
8099808,5,B000CNMU8U,"I received this DVD as a Christmas gift and am confused by the negative reviews.  The DVD starts out with an introduction to bee guardianship before going into extensive information on how to manage a top bar hive. I suppose if you stop the DVD in the first few minutes you might miss all the helpful info. For me, the Video is very thorough, informative, and inspiring. The narration is almost meditative and film work visually appealing. This is a well produced video. I was surprised to see much of the bee handling done without protective gear, gloves, and smoke. A very refreshing approach to Bee keeping...The video lasts around 1 hour 30 minutes. I think I may have gotten a newly released version for Christmas. It's actually dated 2011..... I'm not sure what the 8 minute reviews are about????? .... These guys are on the right track... Impressive...",1293667200,3,859,4.76510067114094
8099809,1,B000CNMU8U,"If you are going to purchase a top-bar hive and have no experience with them, this would be somewhat useful, but it's so short (8-9 minutes) and basic it ought to be free with a small shipping charge, or even better- available to watch online for free. It doesn't even come in a normal DVD case with a cover. It's a DVD-R in a clear plastic jewel case.
I was expecting a lot more for the price. But that's what I get for not reading the fine print, or the previous reviews.",1237248000,,473,4.1521739130434785
8099810,1,B000CNMU8U,"This DVD should be given out free with orders. It is NOT worth your time or money. Do some searching, ask some bee people and get a book or a different tape. Very short dvd.",1156896000,3,173,3.9714285714285715
8099811,5,B000CNMU8U,I was really excited to be able to actually SEE the beekeeping process after reading so much about it. The video really helps to see the process of some of the techniques I have read about in books and Internet research. It gives me more comfort to get started with a new hive and swarm of bees! Looking forward to other videos they put out to further my knowledge of beekeeping.,1152144000,4,379,4.352112676056338
8099812,1,B000CNMU8U,"This video lasts about 9 minutes...definitely NOT worth the price.  Save your money and buy a book.  I realize that this is an introductory video, but there is an incredible amount of information that is lacking.  My favorite line in the video is ""check our website during the summer months""...I assume so you will buy more of their overpriced items.  The only good thing is that there is a 100% satisfaction guarantee...I will definitely be sending this video back.",1136505600,17,466,4.860759493670886
