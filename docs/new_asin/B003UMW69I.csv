4204996,3,B003UMW69I,"If you don't know how ""The Proposal"" will turn out before entering the theater, maybe you're better off because it means you haven't seen as many romantic comedies as I have. I, unfortunately, know the formula like the back of my hand. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad movie, of course, but it does make it a lot harder to get into. Imagine, if you will, two people at opposite ends of the personality spectrum; she's a pushy boss, and he's her lowly personal assistant. Now imagine that they find themselves in close contact for a couple of days, and during that time, they discover that they do, in fact, love each other. Honestly, it doesn't take a degree in cinema to figure this one out. Thankfully, ""The Proposal"" manages to be halfway decent in spite of its overused formula. I'm not quite recommending it, but still, there are worse films out there (""My Life in Ruins"" very quickly comes to mind).

The pushy boss is Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock), who works for a publishing house in New York City. Actually, she's more like the boss from hell, not so much because she's demanding but because she's incredibly mean-spirited, pointing out personal faults that have no business being pointed out. Her lowly personal assistant is Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds), a driven young man with a manuscript he wants published. In the course of fifteen minutes, Margaret fires a prominent employee, bullies a reclusive author into appearing on ""Oprah,"" and orders Andrew to work over the weekend. It doesn't matter to her that he was supposed to go home to Alaska that same weekend for his grandmother's ninetieth birthday.

The crux of the story: Margaret, a Canadian immigrant, has just learned from her superiors that her visa has expired, which means she'll have to leave the company and be deported. Desperate to stay on top, she blackmails Andrew into pretending that he's her fianc. He goes along with it, but only on the condition that he be promoted to an editorial position. They then have to convince an immigration agent (Denis O'Hare) that they're not committing fraud, so they say that they will be going to Alaska over the weekend and surprise Andrew's family with the good news (Margaret's family is conveniently not in the picture). At this point, they agree that it's strictly a business deal; they will get divorced as soon as they possibly can and move on with their lives.

In Alaska, Margaret is shocked to learn that Andrew is from a very affluent family. Here enters his accommodating mother, Grace (Mary Steenburgen), his kooky but loveable grandmother, Annie (Betty White), and his disapproving father, Joe (Craig T. Nelson), who wanted him to stay in Alaska and take over the family business.

The ensuing scenes of Margaret and Andrew fooling everyone around them don't generate big laughs, although their sarcastic verbal jabs are effective. I also admit that they share more than a few smirk-inducing physical moments, such as when they bump into each other and fall over when they happen to be completely naked. There's also a point at which he's forced to get into bed with her because his mother is at the door and wants to serve them breakfast; as they frantically position themselves in a loving pose, Margaret is rudely reminded of what happens to a man's body when he wakes up in the morning. Some of the amusement is balanced with one or two touching moments, as when Margaret lies in bed and tells Andrew facts about herself. I won't rattle off a list, but I will say that she isn't as immune to character attacks as she makes herself out to be.

But for every decent scene, there are at least three others that aren't very good at all. There's a subplot, for example, involving a character named Ramone (Oscar Nuez), who seems to do a little bit of everything in this small Alaska town. When he's not a caterer, he's a minister. And when he's not a minister, he's a shop owner. And when he's not a shop owner, he's a male stripper. We know he's a male stripper because Grace and Annie decide to take Margaret to one of his shows as a surprise. Is there any such thing as Amateur Night at a Chippendale club? There's also a painfully unfunny scene in which Margaret goes off into the woods and spots Annie performing a chanting ritual around a fire pit; Margaret, encouraged to chant along, performs a profanity-laced rap solo.

Tension mounts when, on a whim, Andrew's family decides that his wedding should take place during his visit, specifically on Annie's birthday. Can Andrew and Margaret go through with it knowing it's a sham? Will Margaret be able to reconcile her growing feelings for Andrew? Will Annie be able to alter her old wedding dress to accommodate Margaret's less-than-ample [...]? As I already said, I knew the answers to these questions before entering the theater, and I'm sure most audiences are in the exact same situation. I shouldn't criticize a film for achieving exactly what it wanted to achieve, but really, this romantic comedy formula is getting very old. No, ""The Proposal"" isn't an all-out bad film, but it is grossly unoriginal, and it's filled with jokes that are amusing but hardly hilarious.",1244937600,4,5174,4.775418994413408
4204997,5,B003UMW69I,"Romantic comedy junkies are in for a treat. As a Bullock fan I couldn't resist the sneak preview of The Proposal. Even after the first five minutes of the film were soundless due to technical issues in my theater, I have to say it's one of the best films romantic comedies I've seen in quite some time.

Ryan Reynolds doesn't need words to act, his eyes and facial expressions make his thoughts loud and clear. Are there more expressive eyes in Hollywood? And sarcasm, oh, there is plenty of sarcasm from both main characters. Nobody does psycho/prickly/vulnerable like Sandra Bullock. Anyone who loved While You Were Sleeping and Two Weeks Notice is going to find similar flavors of fun and fire in The Proposal.

The story is quirky and odd enough that I smirked through much of the plot as it unfolded. You can't have romantic comedy without some predictability, but it was a joy to watch. Oscar Nunez (The Office) played multiple scenes and one left me laughing until I squirmed. If you can't stomach the thought of Oscar dancing in a Speedo, you might want to wait for the DVD version so you can skip it. A semi-nude scene with Bullock and Reynolds, along with the Speedo dance make it iffy for kids, as does a smattering of off-color comments and a bit of language. The semi-nude scene runs in the previews I've seen, but there are a few prolonged moments with Bullock covering up but showing lots of skin and a side view of a collision that make it longer in the movie. Betty White looks great and plays a grandma with a special connection to Mother Earth. The scenery is breathtaking.

Overall, though not perfect, this is a movie worth the few hours and the full-price movie ticket investment. A charming, fun, summer evening movie.",1244851200,3,1741,4.627831715210356

I've seen the comments that The Proposal is formulaic, but 45 years from now, no one will even recognize or understand such comments.  They will only see this show for what it is - a brilliantly scripted, perfectly cast, romantic comedy which deftly handles the sensibilities of modern feminism, juxtaposed against the virulence of repressed masculinity.",1525910400,,500,5.0120481927710845

Denis O'Hare, Oscar Nuez, Malin kerman, and Michael Nouri, among others). A familiar plot line, a young woman (Bullock) who is about to be deported, enlists her assistant (Reynolds) to marry her her. Reynolds character was to go on a family visit to his hometown of Sitka, Alaska, so Bullock tags along. In the process, the two become more familiar with each other and hi-jinks ensue! The film received mixed reviews from critics, but praised the chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds. The film was a box office success, grossing over $317 million worldwide, becoming the highest grossing romantic comedy film of 2009. Who listens to critics anyway, right!?!

4205208,5,B003UMW69I,"What struck me first about this sarcastically funny, engaging film was the chemistry between the two lead actors; Sandra Bullock (Margaret Tate) and Ryan Renolds (Andrew Paxton). Margaret is the tyrannical senior editor of an esteemed publishing house. Andrew just happens to be her whipping boy of an assistant in a role reversal of definite ill-fortune. Just as she is making her rounds with Andrew, firing people and calling the shots, she is called into the office of her bosses and then later an eager INS agent. They inform her that her visa has expired and she will be deported back to her home country of Canada. Hmm, now what's a girl to do to stay in the country? As Andrew simpers into the office, Margaret lets the men know of their upcoming nuptials of which Andrew is gagging inside to have to go along with... Until... he realizes that this finally gives him the upper hand with Margaret. She will not promote him to an editor for reasons of her own. He blackmails her and goes along with the scheme. It is Andrew's ""Gammie Annie's"" (Betty White) ninetieth birthday party ensuing in just four days. They must convince his mother and father that they have since fallen in love from Margaret once being his mortal enemy, his sworn nemesis, and now they wish to get married in his hometown of... Sitka, Alaska, no less.

They must face a huge house party together congratulating the happy couple once they arrive in Sitka far from land and at their island home. The party goers love Andrew and want all of the details of how they fell in love to try to convince everyone on that island that they are ready for marriage. From sharing a bedroom at his parent's home as his mother and Gammie believe this is where they should sleep, to dragging Margaret and all of the girls off to a surprise bachelorette party... Keep your eye on the male stripper from the Very Beginning of their Day in Sitka right on through to the end of the film. From boat rides when Margaret cannot swim to letting his family's new puppy get outside to be carried away by an eagle only to be saved by Margaret's cell phone. From blankets to even Easter Egg Hunts. The laughs just keep coming at you. Gammie may just be onto something going on getting a 'feel' for Margaret. She has her come to find her in the deep woods to do a dance for the Spirits where we see Margaret finally let her hair down (literally). The movie does have that fun setup for predictability, but this is why I really loved it. I know what happens and it always makes me smile when viewing it. What makes a straight-laced Margaret come totally unraveled is what is funny and Andrew's reaction to his once dictator boss having found her much softer edges is just as understandable. Sure, it is a while after she almost drowns to death but Andrew deserves a ton of comeuppance after all she has put him through. I would love it if these two could team up for a few more comedies, they do it so well.",1499558400,2,2955,4.472222222222222

It is so fake, so forced, so utterly NOT funny. The principals have ZERO chemistry. This Ryan, who is not the good, funny Ryan, looks like a Starbucks Barista -- angry and fake. There are lots of actors who might have made at least turkey salad out of this turkey, but not this guy.

And just when you think it's safe to give Sandra Bullock credit for knowing it's time to become a producer and not be in front of the camera, she decides to take her clothes off in a movie. Does she not know this is the sign of utter panic and desperation a la Jennifer Aniston?

The premise is interesting, but overall the movie has a lot of silly and hard to buy into scenes that go on for too long. Also, the movie couldn't tell if they wanted Sandra's character to be legitimately strong, or deeply wounded and covering that up with a distant, cold personality. Hollywood is very scared of driven, powerful female characters, so it's no surprise they would take the edge of Sandra.

I think Romantic comedies can be entertaining and still be cleverly written with nuanced female characters, it just doesn't happen often enough. The Proposal is proof of that.",1481328000,,654,4.7368421052631575

I'm biased for Bullock and Deadpool, and the pairing was just fine for me.  Had to pay the rental fee when a sudden need for Sandra hit me,  and it was $3.99 for seven year old film, and I wondered how this one has kept that pricing when many a famous title is already at Netflix streaming or Amazon Prime.  ?????  Answer:  nude scene.  This movie ain't gunna be cheap for years to come.

Five stars because of how much Kleenex I used.....not because I'm a fanboy.  If it had not grabbed me emotionally, then this is a three star effort for general audience.",1478044800,,720,4.4728682170542635

4205663,5,B003UMW69I,"The Proposal is a funny romantic comedy about life, choices, and is full of laughter.  Margaret (played by Sandra Bullock  Miss Congeniality 1 and 2, ), is the book editor for a prestigious firm.  She was calling the shots and was a tyrant to work for.  Everyone in her office was scared of her.  One day her outlandish decisions landed her on the brink of being deported back to Canada.  Her assistant, Andrew (played by Ryan Reynolds ), that she treated so badly for years was the only person that she could turn to, to save her from being deported.  To avoid being deported Margaret abruptly announces that she and Andrew were getting married, unbeknownst to him.

Now Margaret and Andrew has less than three days to learn everything about each other for the investigation hearing, or Margaret will be faced with being deported.  Now even though Andrew knows everything about Margaret after being her assist for several years, Margaret knows nothing about Andrew.  Over the weekend,  Margaret travels to Alaska with Andrew for his grandmothers 90th birthday celebration; will she be able to work through her pride, and learn enough about Andrew to pass the immigration investigation or will she decide that its not worth it and allow herself to get deported?

The Proposal will keep you laughing all the way through.  If you like Sandra Bullock just like I, you will definitely love this movie as well.  I highly recommend it for a night of laughter and fun so invite some friends over and enjoy yourselves.",1459468800,,1510,4.8023255813953485

If you like Reynolds then this may be an easy element for you, but I did like the general romantic script, I just cringe at Reynolds. I seem to be in the minority about disliking Reynolds.

4205968,4,B003UMW69I,"Here we go!  It's another rehashed plot, romantic fluff, mildly entertaining movie that I frankly enjoyed.  It has a great cast, silly premise, and happy ending.

It's about two people thrown together that despise one another.  A high-powered, overbearing diva of a boss in the publishing industry - Sandra Bullock; and a handsome, kind, assistant who seeks a career doing what he loves.  Their relationship as boss/subservient is pretty pathetic, until the big-powered career woman is faced with being deported back to Canada because her visa expired. (You think she would have been on top of that one!)  Since her assistant does everything for her, why not have him marry her so she can stay in the country? Sounds reasonable.  A few threats, the fear of losing his job, and you have a somewhat crazy plot.

Let me just say that Ryan Reynolds doesn't do enough movies, especially with his shirt off. After all, he was voted the sexiest man alive in 2010 by People Magazine.  I really like him, and I think he could be king of romantic comedy rather than a green lantern if he did more movies.  He's engaging, nice eye candy, and has that charismatic sweetheart attraction.  It seems as though he'd rather hide behind the screen doing voice acting of late, and his movies on the horizon don't interest me.

Sandra is a bit different in this role, playing the mean employer, who thinks the world revolves around her life and career.  High-powered and used to getting what she demands, her character is much different.  The only similarities are the ending of the movie that is a mirror of ""While You Were Sleeping,"" which contains the altar confession and love of a family she never had.  In fact, it's so similar, it's a bit plagiarist freaky.

The hoot of the movie is Bette White, who plays the eccentric and feisty grandmother of the clan. Let's face it, that old woman is a classy lady, who shows us that laughter is good for your health.  Does she ever not smile?

Well, the plot is a bit rehashed, but it's good light entertainment. The high point of the movie is, of course, naked Ryan Reynolds and stark naked Sandra Bullock running into each other chest to chest, with Sandra falling on top of him.  Quite hilarious, which I'm sure they must have had a great time filming the scene.  It's a scream watching Sandra beforehand running around with a wash cloth over her privates and her arms across her boobs.  Ryan undresses to show off six pack abs. Of course, my focal point in that scene stayed upon his buff naked body.

In any event, I give more than the general public.  Heck, the scenery in Alaska at least deserves four stars.",1437004800,3,2642,4.634408602150538

Sandra Bullock plays Margaret, a high-powered editor, and Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew, her assistant.

The premise is that the Canadian (Margaret) is going to be deported, and therefore she concocts a plan
to marry Andrew. This leads to their going to his family home in Alaska, and much hilarity ensues.

This is not a waste of two hours, if it is on television or something (or even bought on DVD). Bullock and Reynolds
have good chemistry, but the script reversals seem too wooden and cheesy (formulaic).",1435795200,,616,4.747663551401869

Sandra Bullock is a family favorite and she was delightful in The Proposal. Betty White added a lot to the fun of the movie as did Craig T. Nelson. Ryan Reynolds was cast perfectly for his part too.

The Proposal is light, fun, and well paced for a romantic comedy.",1431820800,,491,4.326086956521739

4206037,3,B003UMW69I,"All last year, I kept hearing how great The Proposal was.  Yes, it was a traditional romantic comedy, but it was good despite that was what I was hearing.  Well, last night I finally got a chance to sit down and watch only to be disappointed in it.

Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) has clawed her way to the top of the publishing world, and she has no intention of letting go.  Those who work for her fear her, and that goes double for her assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Renolds).

But Margaret has a problem.  She's living in New York on an expired visa.  Then she comes up with the perfect idea on how to stay in this country - she'll bully Andrew into marrying her.

Unfortunately, the immigration official is a little suspicious of her sudden engagement, so to sell the engagement, Margaret flies off to Alaska with Andrew to meet his family.  What will his family say to the whole thing?  Will Andrew and Margaret's feelings for each other change?

Based pretty much on the premise and genre, I figured I knew where this film was going from the start, and I was right.  However, there were a couple of surprises along the way that did catch me off guard and make me more interested in the outcome.

Unfortunately, the plot doesn't do what it could with the premise.  Some of the sub-plots introduced to give the characters depth were dropped.  Now I'm willing to admit that not resolving everything is more realistic than we would normally see in this genre (or most movies in general).  However, instead of feeling like a creative choice, it just feels clumsy, like the writer dropped the ball or had too much stuff to try to deal with.  It left me feeling unsatisfied.

Sadly, I never quite bought the romance either.  I felt like we got to know Andrew pretty well by the time the movie was over, and I understood his motives and actions most of the way through.  However, I never fully warmed up to Margaret.  She was so cold and mean in the beginning that even the moments meant to soften her didn't go far enough.  Or maybe I would have bought those moments if they had lasted into the next scene.  Plus the chemistry between Ryan and Sandra was only so-so.  To completely buy everything that Andrew does, I needed something more.

With a collection of comedy vets in the cast, I can't fault any of the performances, even by the leads.  Despite the lacking chemistry, I did feel that Sandra and Ryan were putting in good performances.  And they shone in some of the zanier scenes.  Likewise, Mary Steenberg was great as Andrew's mom.  Craig T. Nelson was a bit more serious as Andrew's dad, but he provided the right degree of menace when called for and comedy when needed.  It was Betty White who stole the show as Andrew's 90 year old grandmother.  That woman is a master of comedy, and she proved it again by being the best thing in this movie.

Some of the comedy came from putting the characters in awkward situations, which doesn't always work for me.  However, I did find several scenes that were pretty funny, especially before the action switched from New York.  And watching Margaret battle a dog and an eagle was funny.

While The Proposal isn't the great romantic comedy that I had heard it was, it was amusing and enjoyable.  This isn't something to rush out to watch, but if you happen to catch it, it's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.",1431129600,,3367,4.480263157894737

4206040,2,B003UMW69I,"I went into this film optimistically.

It was recommended to me by my brother and he said it was ""awesome"", so I decided to check it out. It hit my funny bone at the start.
They did an okay job making the guy come across weak and timid towards his boss, but I felt it wasn't as good as it could have been. Still made for some funny moments however.

As the movie went on I lost my connection with the weak underling guy and made a connection with the female boss that honestly came across more weak and in need help from about two quarters in all the way to the end.

The male actor came across downright harsh and really, punky towards the end which made me feel bad the boss lady was gonna end up with him.

Overall, the movie had some funny parts but the overall plot suffered due to acting and script flaws.

I had high hopes for the film going into it which might or might not have contributed to this feeling of lack, but if you are looking for a few giggles and a semi-romantic story, check it out.",1430956800,,1005,4.107142857142857

1. I am a big fan of Ryan Reynolds
2. I don't think I am the target audience for this movie.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

I enjoy comedies and I thought I would like this because it had Ryan Reynolds and I enjoy his work.  Yes even in that god awful Green Lantern movie.  I think he did a pretty good job in this movie and he played his character very well.  Sandra Bullock's acting in this movie was just a little too stiff for me and it seemed like she was just trying too hard to be a cold-hearted boss who threw her weight around to get whatever she wanted.  I like her better when she is acting natural.  For an example of this, I would cite her performance in ""The Heat.""  She was serious but also funny in that movie.  Also Betty White is in this movie and as far as her peformance, she was just okay.

The plot is pretty basic.  Ryan Reynolds is an office lacky at a publishing house in NYC who has dreams of being an editor and having his book published.  His father wants him to come home and run the family business.  His mother just wants the family to be together.  Sandra Bullock is going to be deported back to Canada so she blackmails Ryan into marrying her so she can stay in the country or she will have his career destroyed.

Some of the gags are funny, like Sandra dancing in the woods and singing rap lyrics.  Ryan and Sandra running into each other nude and trying not to look at each other.  And the part with the dog and the hawk is pretty funny too.  Other than those few scenes, the movie is pretty boring and the ending is totally predictable.

4206332,5,B003UMW69I,"As a fan of Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds, and Betty White, it was a must for me to see The Proposal. After watching it the first time, I realized the movie was written with a perfect mixture of comedy and romance. The writers and producers drew me in with the originality of the movie.
 The writers strategy of involving a love story with a comedy intrigues the audience from the opening scene. We know that Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is a hard working book editor with a hard exterior and interior. There are no excuses in her book; she expects the work to be done and if its not, there will be consequences. Then the scene cuts to Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) waking up late for work. The following scene is the first taste of comedy the audience will receive. Andrew is Margarets assistant and right hand man. He is expected to get her coffee before he shows up for work, which that particular morning was a struggle because he was way behind schedule. He ends up spilling her coffee all over himself while he is rushing to her office.
 Andrew gave her his coffee hoping she wouldnt notice when Margaret receives a call from her boss telling her to report to his office. Margaret finds out that she is losing her job because her visa was denied. She tells her boss that she cant leave the country because she is engaged to her assistant, Andrew. Obviously the two were going to get engaged, the movie is called The Proposal after all but the way they got engaged was interesting.
Also, the writers put scenes in The Proposal that are totally unexpected. Just when the movie felt sappy the writers through in some comedy. For example, the part in the woods featuring Andrews grandma (Betty White) and Margaret has become a classic scene. Betty White has accomplished a lot in her lifetime thus far but, the scene of her giving thanks to mother-nature in the middle of the woods has to be one of her best performances. Gammy and Margaret end up dancing around a fire to the song Get Low by Lil Jon and The East Side Boyz; just picture that for a second. Their dance move are priceless and provide laughs for all.
 The writers did a good job with originality but, the producers did too. Its time to give them some credit. The movie continues with Andrews family in his home town, Sitka, Alaska. Why Alaska? The general public does not know Alaska, but the movie gave us a chance to learn what it would be like to live there. Also, basing the movie in Alaska makes it unique to all other movies. How many films can you name that take place in Alaska off hand? Not many thats for sure.
 Another thing the producers did well was showing the antagonist, the immigration officer. Even though he doesnt have a lot of screen time, it is known from the start that he has an eye on the two so called love birds. The immigration office gets involved in the surprise engagement of Margaret and Andrew because it is illegal to fake an engagement to stay in the U.S. Margaret ad Andrew attempt to prove their love to the immigration personal but, with no real emotions between them it becomes hard. The immigration officer on their case keeps the movie in perspective. Without him, there would be no real conflict to the movie.
  Comparing this romantic comedy to other movies in its genre, The Proposal stands out. It is not the typical romantic comedy because you cant predict whats going to happen in every scene. The originality the producers and writers gave the film, makes it more appealing and easier to fall in love with.",1411516800,,3523,4.52276295133438

The chemistry between the stars is there and that goes a long way without turning the film into a sexual romp.  A delightful film with great actors who know their profession.  Hollywood needs to make more films of this caliber, believe me there is an audience who want films such as this one and is sick of all the trash that is released these days.",1398211200,,458,4.241379310344827

I was not disappointed with this movie and Betty White as the Grandma just makes it all worth it.

I was a little disappointed with the big dramatic end. But then what did I expect, but it just felt like the same as other movies she has been in. Which is why I gave it 4 Stars.

I do hope to see these two in a movie together again.",1396137600,,525,3.8425925925925926

4206514,5,B003UMW69I,This movie was quite a surprise because of the Trailer for the movie. The scene that showed her getting dumped into the icy cold Alaskan waters led you to believe it was an intentional act when in fact it wasn't and was part of a very Poignant scene.

4206529,1,B003UMW69I,Worst film I've ever had the misfortune to watch. I like Sandra Bullock and can't believe she lowered herself to this rubbish. Nonsense un-believable plot - the ending is obvious 5 seconds into the film. Forced to watch it by my better half - who also agrees its 90 minutes of her life she'll never get back....boooooo. Only gets 1 star as Amazon won't let me give it none (if its even possible to give nothing...but you know what I mean..),1394150400,3,440,4.444444444444445

There were some scenes that were only kind of funny and didn't seem to have anything to do with the rest of the movie.  I wished they had spent a bit more time developing the relationship between the two main characters instead.  They didn't interact that much and I had a hard time believing they could have fallen in love that quickly without even talking to each other.  I know, it's a romantic comedy, I am not asking for too much, just a bit more than I got.  I do love Sandra Bullock and it was worth watching for that reason alone.",1392422400,,606,4.327433628318584

4206562,5,B003UMW69I,This funny movie stole my heart.  Having lived both in the City and in the Pacific Northwest - that aspect alone made me laugh.  I think the funniest part was when the eagle stole Sandra's cell phone and she offers him the dog.  It's also a very moving love story.,1389744000,,264,4.24

It wasn't done with realism in mind, and of course our romance finds its way in the end, but not very convincingly.  It seemed as if the writers were trying too hard.  I particularly felt that the ""naked"" scene was unnecessary, and did not contribute to the plot.  Romance is much more effective when most of it is left to the imagination of the viewer.  Consider Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in ""A Romance to Remember.""",1389225600,,568,4.466019417475728

She knows literally nothing about him beyond his name and makes all the wrong assumptions (of course). Turns out his home is in Alaska, and the family awaits the couple (including Betty White as Grandma - perfect casting) to welcome them into the wider family.

4206639,4,B003UMW69I,"From the busy streets of New York City to the surreal scenery of Sitka, Alaska, The Proposal is a must see laugh-out-loud romantic comedy.  At the beginning, the movie may seem like your typical clich storyline of two people starting out hating each other and by the end they are madly in love with one another.  Director Anne Fletcher however, does a phenomenal job of making your typical love story a must see movie, from the moving character development to the witty humor between characters; it comes together to be a worthwhile movie.

Sandra Bullock playing Margaret is a successful book editor from Canada.  When her career is put in jeopardy because of an expired visa she turns to her assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) to keep her from being deported back to Canada.  Risking legal actions, Margaret blackmails Andrew into a fake engagement in exchange for a promotion.  The two of them then fly out to small town Sitka, Alaska where Andrew's family lives to announce their engagement and in hopes of convincing the immigration agent that they are actually indeed in love.

Right away you can see that Bullock is portraying a strong and independent woman.  She is a powerful and successful workingwoman and is feared by many; her colleagues call her the ""Office Witch"".  At the same time though, she has this spunky personality that is seen when she is caught dancing in the woods with Gammy (Betty White) to the song ""Get Low"".  She knows how to play her role just right and doesn't overdo her character.  She does this by putting just the right amount of emotion into her scenes.  The moment when Bullock begins to see how many people will be affected by the fake engagement is when you really start to warm up to her and get to see her ""sensitive side.""  Yes, this ""Office Witch"" drops a few tears.  From her spunky and sensitive side to her stern side she is an all around likable actress.

The forced romance between Bullock and Reynolds turns out to be an entertaining comedy.  The chemical energy that emerges throughout the movie makes it fresh and irresistible.  They play the ""opposites attract"" very well; as Bullock is more stern and stuck up and Reynolds is more easy going.  Their opposite personalities create a humorous tension between them.  As the two of them begin to learn more about each other they begin to fall for one another.  This pushes them to play the ""I like you so I'm going to pretend I hate you, attitude.""  Bullock and Reynolds have a one of a kind duo going between them that makes the movie entertaining from the beginning until the end.

The Proposal may resemble a plot much like many other romantic comedies, but this one draws you in.  The interactions between Bullock and Reynolds keeps you attuned and has you loving them and the movie by the end.",1379980800,,2797,4.674846625766871
4206640,3,B003UMW69I,"From Ryan Reynolds chiseled bod, to Betty White's awesome Gammy portrayal this movie had the potential to be a truly funny flick. The chances were even doubled when you threw Sandra Bullock, Craig T. Nelson, and Mary Steenburgen into the mix. I loved the tension between father and son, mother and husband and Betty White's goofiness. Sandra Bullock's extreme awkwardness as she desperately tried to play cool was also endearing. Yes there were times when I did laugh out loud, but there were also times when I cringed at the desperate lengths they went to in throwing too many one-liners into the mix to try to make up for the lack of character development. Somehow it just never lived up to the movie it could have been. Please don't misunderstand me, the Actors all did phenomenal with the material and the time frame they were given, it just seemed to be another tired reboot of The Taming Of The Shrew, or My Fair Lady if you prefer.",1379808000,,938,4.622754491017964

Her assistant editor Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) is equally efficient. But then Immigration catch up with Tate because, despite being a Canadian, there are errors in the paperwork granting her the right to work in the U.S. She is faced with the prospect of deportation out of the country for a period of at least 12 months. Ever resourceful, she decides to marry Paxton, which takes him rather by surprise. Now Tate beliefs that Paxton probably lives in some hovel of a N.Y. apartment, but to celebrate their `engagement' they go to visit Paxton's family home in Alaska. Paxton's mother, Grace (Mary Steenburgen) and father Joe (Craig T. Nelson) are less than pleased to have the news of their son's impending marriage thrust upon them so unexpectedly. Back in Alaska, Paxton's ex-girlfriend Gertrude (Malin Akerman) appears on the scene but, being a small-town girl, seems quite content to let her boyfriend pursue his life in New York. So will Tate and Paxton really get married? This is a very witty movie, as we have come to expect from Sandra Bullock (former Miss Congeniality), and is thoroughly entertaining.",1364774400,,1252,5.08252427184466

With that in mind, I do have some standards: that the chemistry be evident between the characters; that the dialog be clever  I appreciate sarcasm and quick witted exchanges; that there be some physical comedy, but not overly much; that the ending provide a sense of happiness in the results.
This movie meets all of the above. I purchase DVDs so that I may watch favorite entertainment as my mood dictates and as much as I wish, and this movie also fits that requirement  a feel good movie that no matter how many times I watch it, I still smile, chuckle and tear up.",1360108800,,670,4.352

It starts in NYC where Reynolds is pursuing his true love: writing (or is it editing? or both? Who cares).  The plot contrives to throw both of them on a sudden vacation to his family home in Alaska where they must pretend to be engaged and naturally, being a romantic comedy, they have to move from pretending to realizing...

It's cute enough and if you want a plesant movie with an upbeat ending that does not require much thinking and is rather family friendly (it's pretty mild compared to some PG-13) this should be your cup of tea.  Or make that a hot coffee (It's Alaska after all)",1348617600,,871,4.673202614379085

4206940,5,B003UMW69I,"This has to be one of the silliest, least believable romcoms I have ever seen... and I loved it!

The whole premise is ridiculous, crazy, beyond silly. Basically any synonym you want to find for ""this is unrealistic even by romcom standards"" would fit in here.

However: it works.

For me, there are two reasons. First is the beautiful scenery - this is not Alaska, but Massachusetts does make a beautiful stand in, and the scenery adds considerably to the otherworldiness and sense of romance of the film.

The second, and by far the most important reason, is that Bullock and Reynolds have absolutely wonderful chemistry. They're both attractive people to start with, and both possess the comic timing and comedy chops to shine in any script that errs on the side of silly. Put them both together, though, and things get exponentially better; they are funny and believable and sweet as a mismatched pretend couple who find that pretending has unforeseeable consequences.

If you're after a film that's remotely true to life, steer a wide berth - you'll likely hate this. It's silly, unrealistic, and sweet enough to rot your teeth.

If, however, you want to laugh till your throat hurts and be swept away into an alternate, much fluffier, much more romantic reality, as far as lighter than air confectionary goes, this is pure escapism and genuinely funny. For its particular genre? It's pitch perfect.",1348012800,,1404,4.90295358649789

4206947,2,B003UMW69I,"Margaret (Sandra Bullock) is an aggressive executive in a publishing firm, about to be deported back to Canada because she violated the terms of her visa.  She tells her astonished boss and a very skeptical INS agent that she is going to marry her assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds, a very engaging actor), a dogsbody whom she bullies and overworks.  He thinks fast on his feet and extracts the promise of promotion to editor as a condition.  Then he takes her home to meet the family.  In Sitka, Alaska.

Up till then it was passable, although where have we heard this premise before?  But then it gets so formulaic and silly, it was barely watchable in spots.  The scene where the two actors accidentally get tangled up together stark naked was stupid and cheap.  Betty White is always a joy, and I'm glad she's getting work; but you could see how they used her in this.  Of course Margaret softens and becomes lovable, and of course Andrew falls in love with her.  Why, is not exactly explained.  Reynolds was 33 when this was made; Bullock was 12 years older and looked it.  It would have been a better movie if the writer had made a point of it, I think. You know, wasted her youth on her career.  Sort of like Bullock's having wasted hers making too many films like this.  Remember the chapel scene in While You Were Sleeping where Lucy (Bullock) stops the ceremony and confesses that she's been deceiving the groom's family?  Yup.  She does it again.  The really irritating thing is that they thought we wouldn't notice, or if we did, it didn't matter.  The expendable, disposable audience. Bullock was a producer of this and frankly I'm turned off by this dame's gimlet eye on profit.

There's no accounting for taste, and I know I've loved some films many others hated.  But some of these 5-star posts are just bewildering.  ""The chemistry!  You can just tell these actors like each other so much!"" Well, why shouldn't they like each other?  And even if (for some reason) they loathed each other, do you really think we would know?  It seems to suggest these actors couldn't act if they had to.  A number of posts mention the gorgeous Alaska scenery.  I mean, I've never even been to Alaska and I knew at once that house was not in Alaska.  How easy it is to fool people, after all.  It makes me feel jaded, that's what.

I won't rent this film again.  I'll certainly never buy it.  But if it came on tv some night, even without commercials, even if there were nothing else on, would I sit through it again?  No.",1346630400,2,2519,4.504424778761062

4206953,5,B003UMW69I,"Betty White, the all-pro Snickers football star, is delightfully type cast as an over the top grandmother who plays the ""death card"" to get her way.

Sandra Bullock is an uptight Canadian whose visa has ran out so she blackmails her male secretary into marrying her. Ryan Reyonds plays the secretary. The Department of Immigration apparently is so caught up with our immigration problems that is has nothing better to do than hound Canadians with expired visas. They end up visiting his folks in Alaska, where Bullock is out of place.

As it turns out the secretary, whose income Bullock makes sport of, has a rich family which owns a town. Here she is accepted and made to feel as family, which of course makes her uncomfortable under the circumstances. What I liked was the guy who was the waiter, male exotic dancer, town store clerk, and the Justice of the Peace.  Mary Steenburgen is a fine actress, however you couldn't tell by this movie as her lines were few, and Betty White stole every scene they were in.

4206962,3,B003UMW69I,"This movie starts out with a very rough professional relationship between two people. Both of them are not truly happy in their lives but they feel they are doing what they need to in order to succeed in life. They have good jobs, they are young, they are good looking. But as the movie progresses they run into a few problems, the main lead woman (Margaret) is told that she won't be able to have her job anymore because she is Canadian and her visa in order to work in the United States was denied. She then convinces her assistant (Andrew) to marry her in order to keep her job and therefore her happiness. Andrew agrees to do this only because she has threatened to take his job away if he does not help her. They go away for the weekend in order to tell Andrew's parents that they are getting married. The over arching theme of the weekend and therefore the movie is that in order to find true purpose in life you must find your significant other. The people in your life are the things that make life worthwhile, they make it worth doing anything, being in a certain job, loving someone that's in your life.
  God is not a part of family; He is not even a part of the movie. He does not get mentioned at all, the wedding that takes place does not happen in a church instead it happens in a barn. The only thing that is spiritual is the thanking of the ""spirits"" which is not taken seriously. It is given in a very comical light; the grandmother who is thanking the spirits is shown in a very humorous view. The only authority that is expressed within the movie is that of people and most of those that are in authority are expressed as unintelligent or uncaring. The only gods in this movie are money and self. The money is expressed through the success that the people try to attain through their jobs. The self is expressed in pretty much everything else that is happening, it is all about how does it make me feel what are the emotions that I am going through, what kind of emotions do others make me feel. The media part of this movie has a couple of mixed messages. It does not give any value to God and what God's part in our lives is. He is not the authority He is not what gives us hope or a future through this movie. We only need to find the one that is going to love us for the rest of our lives; that should be our goal. We need to find love in those around them instead of in a relationship with God the Father.
 This movie is good art in my opinion. It has good technical excellence; it was well done with good acting and good writing of the script. The story is valid, there are a few stretching details that would be a little hard to believe at times but at the same time they could happen. The content is solid, it's a good story line and something that someone can get very easily caught up in. I find that this movie is good entertainment although we need to be careful about who we watch it with and what parts people are exposed to. There is one scene that is inappropriate for someone young and to be honest it's a bit inappropriate for anyone. It is very funny but at the same time it is two naked people to say it bluntly. The pair is completely nude, and the camera captures all but the most sensitive regions of their bodies throughout the scene. In essence, the filmmakers show us everything, while not showing quite everything. Because of this I'm not sure I would be able to endorse the entire movie, especially without some reservations.  I found that the love that Andrew and Margaret have for each other is completely unselfish. This is the kind of love that we should be having for one another. I would be able to put that into perspective and instead of two humans loving each other it would be God loving us. The love that He has for us is perfect and although sometimes the love that others have is self seeking we would never have to worry about that with Christ's love.",1335657600,,3913,4.262449528936743

So she bullies her executive assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) into marriage, thus ""The Proposal"". However the tide may have turned when she sees his home and family.

Many people think Grandma Annie (Betty White) makes the movie with her dry one-liners and attitude. And a lot of Betty white the actor shows through Grandma Annie the character.

The movie mostly takes place in a mock up of what Sitka Alaska should look like. It makes you want to go there.  One of my favorite scenes is when Margaret is warned not to let the puppy outside or the eagles will snatch it.

Be sure to listen to the voice over commentary. Most voice over commentaries are dry dissertations from film historians or drunks that do not remember the movie. This commentary however is quite interesting and informative.

Also be sure to watch the alternate ending.

Again Blu-ray is just Blu-ray so I will not bore you with the details.

Therein begins the romantic comedy. Set mostly in Alsaka, the movie becomes as good as the beautiful Alaskan scenery. Some of it is downright funny; some is tongue & cheek. The ending in inevitable. But, how they arrive there is what makes the story.
The two leads are backed up by Craig T. Nelson, Mary Steenburgen, & Betty White in supporting roles. All are good. White is her typical shiny self.

Bullock is typically excellent, as is Reynolds. The movie is by no means a chick-flick at all. Anyone would find this 21st century version of the romantic comedy funny & enjoyable.

4207001,3,B003UMW69I,"If you've seen the standard Hollywood rom-com--any standard Hollywood rom-com--then you have seen THE PROPOSAL, a formulaic and predictable slight rib-tickler that, in the end, leaves you completely. . .indifferent.  Sandra Bullock has played this type of part (the workaholic, all-consuming business professional) dozens of times before, and Ryan Reynolds has ten stages of annoying (in this role he is at stage six; no, make that seven); yet the premise is cute enough:  Bullock's character is in danger of being deported back to Canada, so to avoid this little dilemma she strong-arms her apprehensive assistant (Reynolds) into a faux engagement.  And to further dig themselves into a hole before a suspicious federal agent (Denis O'Hare), the would-be couple announces they will be heading for the weekend to introduce the would-be bride to the would-be groom's real life family--in Alaska (more on that later).  Once the story shifts there, the deception is further layered, before it unravels--yet (who would've thunk!) both protagonists suddenly realize they are hopelessly in luv.

It's cute (like I said), and there are some giggle moments, and the venerable Betty White is constantly rushed in to say the choice one-liners (playing Reynolds' grandma), yet there's nothing here to offer a new twist or unique plot shift to keep THE PROPOSAL from rushing headlong towards its predictable ending.  Speaking of annoying, what in the world is Oscar Nunez doing in this picture?  (Besides annoying us?)  Further speaking of annoying, as I spend half my time in the great state of Alaska, trying to pass off a Massachusetts seaside community as Sitka, AK, is the greatest howler of them all.  Yet I'm too indifferent over this rom-com to dwell on it.

Sandra Bullock is always a joy to watch work and Ryan Reynolds (a fine actor as well) is welcome eye candy for us women--yes! This is a nice 'feel good' movie. It has some fun plot twists and turns to keep you engaged with all of the characters. And the main characters are supported and made very earthy, funny, real, and relate-able by the choice of actors portraying Andrew's family. Betty White fans will have an especial treat. I bought a single disc copy which I am regretting because I would love to see the special features that the writer/director speak of in the audio commentary. It is a movie to be watched again and again by men and women alike.

I can think of absolutely no other movie I have ever seen where the script failed the actors so badly. But that's not the end of the story. To show how cheap and superficial the director, writer, and producer were, the movie for the second half of the movie takes place in Sitka Alaska in order to add authenticity to the warmth of the story. As someone who lives in Alaska, however it was painfully obvious that:

A. the movie was not filmed in Alaska.
B. the extras were not from Alaska.
C. the building architecture did not reflect Alaskan architecture.

During the directors commentary the writer and director admit they could not afford to film the story in Alaska, so here's a thought for them: Movies are a visual medium!, pick another location for the movie setting if your too cheap to even go see what Alaska looks like! Next time Sandra does a movie set in her home state of Texas, I hope she will substitute her filming in Massachusetts using cut and paste background special effects.

In this movie, Margaret Tate, the editor-in-chief of a high-powered publishing company, is about to be deported back to Canada, and she will not be able to work at her job. So what does Margaret do? She forces her secretary, Andrew Paxton, to marry her. Margaret is a cold-hearted, mean woman, so Andrew only agrees to marry her after she agrees to save his job and promote him. They must pass a test to ensure that they truly want to marry one another, and Margaret and Andrew travel to go to his Gammy's birthday party in Sitka, Alaska. Margaret begins to realize how much Andrew's family loves him, and she begins to fall for Andrew as well.

4207032,5,B003UMW69I,"`The Proposal' is a genuinely funny rom-com starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. This follows Margaret, a hard nosed publishing editor, who is about to be deported when her visa expires and Andrew, her assistant who she blackmails into marrying her so she can stay in the country and keep her job. They then go to meet his family in Alaska and the real fun begins. Bullock shows yet again what a hilarious physical comedian she is and Reynolds has superb dead pan line delivery and this film had me laughing out loud at various points throughout. The chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds is obvious from the word go and they are a wonderful couple together on screen. This also has stellar performances from Mary Steenburgen and Betty White who play the mother and grandmother and who welcome Margaret into the family whole heartedly. This is a gentle film and doesn't sink to crass or overtly rude jokes to raise a laugh, instead it has real warmth and genuine humour and makes for just under two hours fun viewing. The extras include the obligatory commentaries and a funny outtakes reel which shows the fun had on set during filming. All in all this is a funny and heart warming film, one of the better rom-coms I have seen and is well worth checking out.

Sandra Bullock plays one of the most uptight characters I've ever seen in a movie.  That she moves naturally in her restrictive wardrobe is impressive, although it seems that she has a bustle, but of course it's only Sandra Bullock in passing.  Well, it's a nice view either way.  Clearly, I like chick flicks, and this is a good chick flick.

It's about the NYC book publishing scene, and a determined female editor who gets things done, but who, for some reason, can't seem to get herself straight with the INS (she's Canadian).  So, like a lot of immigrants these days, she faces deportation, until she decides her rather overly cooperative executive secretary will marry her.  And he goes along with it, until a visit to the INS office ends up with them taking a trip to Sitka, Alaska, for his grandmother's 90th birthday.  Among the glaciers, the spark of romance is lit.

If I had a problem with this film, it was with the class angle.  She thinks he's poor, and then she finds he's not, and suddenly, he's not so bad.  It's not the movie's fault, it's our ever more stratified society, but I found that aspect rather unappealing.  Otherwise, as light and fluffy entertainment, this film delivers quite nicely.

Funny because it makes fun of the immigration service that is picking on silly details in the marriage between an American man and a Canadian woman who is being expelled because of an expired visa.

It is also funny because most of the film takes place in Alaska and the poor Canadian from Toronto does not exactly know how to react to eagles, waterways, family traditions and some other more exotic traditions. But apart from that it is schmaltzy to the extreme. It's a shame because they had a beautiful subject and the man like the woman, or the boy like the girl were good looking and we could have appreciated a little more skin contact.

4207054,1,B003UMW69I,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  For those who haven't seen 'The Proposal', the plot is rather simple.  Faced with being deported to her native Canada, publishing business career woman Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock), proposes to her assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) that she marry him, in order to save her job and offer him a chance at promotion. The film has been compared to the 2009 dramedy 'The Devil Wears Prada'. Ostensibly, they both are about smug career women who are universally hated by their employees. But Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly is a multi-dimensional portrait based on a real person and Sandra Bullock's 'Margaret Tate' is a dopey caricature.

  Many internet posters have condemned 'The Proposal' for its predictability. Sure enough, Margaret Tate eventually comprehends the error of her ways and finally softens up; but it's what happens before the predicable ending (the 'softening up') that relegates the film to the trash heap.

  There was a time when Sandra Bullock actually showed some talent as a comic actor. Consider Miss Congeniality--the film was humorous due to the cleverness of the fish out of water premise. Sandra's FBI agent character had to adapt in the prim and proper beauty pageant world. And we were attracted to Sandra since her character was realistically tough and confident.

  Not so in 'The Proposal'. You would think that a tough as nails editor-in-chief would know how to handle herself, especially in the rarefied world of the Paxton family--both Tate and the Paxtons are quite well off. But no, Bullock plays Tate as a buffoon, someone to laugh at. Somehow, being in the more rural atmosphere of Sitka, Alaska, is supposed to turn Tate into a total klutz. Not only is she unable to efficiently move her luggage or climb down a ladder but she also can't swim! While Miranda Priestly was arrogant and sometimes petty, she also had an aura of competency that made her an attractive and interesting character. Until her sudden epiphanies toward the climax of 'The Proposal', Tate is completely petty and never shows any sign of competence. Take for example, the idiotic scene where the family dog is snatched by an eagle; eventually Tate saves the dog but she's more concerned about her cell phone, after the eagle flies away with it.

  It's easy to understand why Bullock would be attracted to the 'straw man' character of Margaret Tate. As the dictionary tells us--a straw man is a ""fabricated or conveniently weak or innocuous person, object, matter, etc., used as a seeming adversary or argument."" The shrewd businesswoman that she is, Bullock realizes how the masses (the film going public) despise such characters as Tate, since most of us have encountered such arrogant people one time or another during our employment history. In reality, such people never realize the 'error' of their ways and usually are rewarded for their amoral behavior (take Miranda Priestly in 'The Devil Wears Prada' as the perfect example). Since the masses can't face reality, they would rather indulge in wish fulfillment by cheering on the comeuppance of a straw man. And that's exactly what Bullock has done here--provided a buffoon that the masses can sneer at--while she knows full well that a real tough as nails editor-in-chief would never be anything like a Margaret Tate who ""hates shopping and sightseeing"" and hasn't had sex for a year and a half!

  Before 'The Proposal' gets all mushy with the failed marriage ceremony and Ryan Reynolds rushing back to NYC where he convinces Bullock that he's truly fallen in love with her, numerous bloggers and internet posters have taken note of many other unfunny scenes in 'The Proposal', that crop up before the sentimental denouement. A few that come to mind include: Bullock and Reynolds clumsily falling over each other while in the nude, Bullock being entertained by an amateur Hispanic 'Chippendale's' stripper and Betty White playing the grandmother dressed up as a Native American, performing a bizarre Native American dance for Bullock (followed by her equally bizarre hip hop dance in response).

  Despite Ryan Reynold's sincere performance as Andrew Paxton, the character also doesn't make much sense. Paxton supposedly holds himself as being true to himself (as well as being an anti-materialist) when he rejects his father's demand to come back home and take over the family business. But at the same time, he's willing to compromise his values by accepting Tate's illegal (and immoral) proposal, in order to further his career.

  Even if one's 'heart strings' are pulled by the sudden transformation of the lovers' affection for each other at the film's climax, the bulk of 'The Proposal' is 'comedy' of the lowest sort. And Bullock too has hit new lows by agreeing to be part of this enterprise. The next time around, she should look for more excellent screenplays. One is named ""The Devil Wears Prada"".",1281139200,3,4931,5.035670356703567

1. Sandra Bullock is getting too old for this. If she wants to continue in Romantic Comedy movies she needs to start filming with actors her age. Reynolds is way too young.

2. Reynolds, not Bullock, is the star of this film. His timing was excellent, and in nearly every scene he shines. It's time for him to headline a movie or two.

She's a lovely, likable person in real life and was perfect casting for this role of a New York editor who blackmails her assistant (Andrew, played by Ryan Reynolds) into proposing to her so she can avoid deportation to Canada. Turn-about being fair play, he then blackmails her for a promotion. Although she's a workaholic and a demanding boss, she's really a sweet, mixed-up young woman; blackmail is out of character for her, but she's desperate...

When Andrew takes her to his parent's mansion in Alaska to meet them, they're surprised when he announces they're getting married. The trip is a ruse to convince the deportation officer of the sincerity of the engagement.

The women in the family (mother, played by Mary Steenburgen, and grandmother, Betty White) treat Margaret with utmost respect and learn to love her. Having never enjoyed life with a close-knit family, Margaret develops strong feelings for them. And in the course of staying in their home, she learns what a great guy Andrew really is.

Predictably, Margaret and Andrew develop feelings for each other, yet neither will admit it, preferring to spar instead. The family dog causes most of the hilarious scenes between the couple, not to mention Andrew's lovable grandmother. (Who doesn't love the irrepressible Betty White, still a scene-stealer at 87?)

The only hold-out is Andrew's father who is disappointed in his son for not following in his footsteps; he tries to thwart their plans by conniving with the deportation officer.

This romantic comedy has several unexpected twists and turns, and you'll never believe what happens on the day of the wedding! But Betty White saves the day by pulling some high-jinx of her own.

All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. Comedy + Drama + Sandra Bullock = Feel-good movie! Highly recommended.

Sandra Bullock and Betty White are standouts in this movie. Ryan Reynolds makes a strong male lead and the supporting cast are just as terrific.  It is a true romantic comedy that evoked many laugh out loud moments no matter how many times friends and I view it.  An improbable plot, Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock), needs a quickie, no fuss, no mess green card since she is about to be deported and orders her business assistant, Ryan Reynolds, to make it happen.  The dialogue between the two leads is witty, smart and funny.  Of course this leads to romantic disaster followed by more romantic disaster, and finally true happiness and love.

4207062,4,B003UMW69I,"""The Proposal"" is what it is-an above average date movie.  The film is elevated by a superb turn by Sandra Bullock that recalls Meryl Streep in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and Betty White as a wacky granny.  The film is diminished somewhat by Ryan Reynolds' weak romantic male lead.  Regardless, passable summer fare that's best appreciated watching with someone you love.",1277510400,2,368,5.0

4207064,4,B003UMW69I,"2009's ""The Proposal"" features Sandra Bullock as Margaret Tate, the inconsiderate and career-driven senior editor of a New York City publishing house. When the Canadian-born Margaret is suddenly faced with deportation for lack of a visa, she announces a surpise engagement to her much put-upon executive assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds). The price of Andrew's cooperation is a promotion and a weekend with his family in his hometown of Sitka, Alaska.

What could easily have been a formulaic romantic comedy becomes highly entertaining, thanks to the excellent on-screen chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Their verbal sparring is only one highlight of Margaret's hilarious ""fish out of water"" weekend in Alaska. Margaret will discover that Andrew has a tight-knit if tumultuous family (Craig T. Nelson, Mary Steenbergen, and the scene-stealing Betty White), an attractive ex-girlfriend (Malin Ackerman), and surprising depth of character. Offered the opportunity for a quick family wedding, Margaret will suffer a sudden and fateful attack of conscience.

Massachusetts is a somewhat less than convincing stand-in for Alaska, but the writers work in some appropriate jokes about the long summer days, convoluted transportation, and the hazards of being a small dog in Alaska. The story pacing allows Margaret and Andrew to discover each other, but not too fast, while working through such challenges as ad-libbing their marriage proposal story on the fly for Andrew's family and friends.

""The Proposal"" is highly recommended as good fun for romantic comedy fans. This reviewer hopes Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds get another outing together.",1276992000,,1670,5.566929133858268

When she finds out that she's up for deportation back to Canada, though, because her visa has run out, she cons her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds), into marrying her so she can stay in the country. As the INS starts looking into their case Margaret must go to Alaska with Andrew to meet his family and to learn more about each other to pass the examination.

Sandra Bullock is America's sweetheart. There is doubtful a person in this country who doesn't like her, and 2009 showed that more than ever as she broke her personal box office twice in the same year after 22 years in the game. She also accomplished that by not playing by anyone's rules but her own. While most people are searching for project after project to keep their name out there, but Bullock hasn't appeared onscreen since 2007's Premonition. So after 2 years out of the spotlight how does her return film fare?

Very well, actually. Don't get me wrong, this romantic comedy doesn't add anything new to the cannon of romantic comedies, and that was probably intentional. While we all might want a movie that's going to stimulate us in a new way, we can't always expect that. This movie does a great job at making it enjoyable enough to keep your mind off that fact that it's not really feeding you anything new. The actors are effortlessly likable, and have great chemistry together. Had the movie had made any other casting choices this movie would have gone down as just another romcom.

It's interesting to me that Bullock chose this role to be her return film. Typically she chooses characters that are immensely likable, but even in this role you still like her even if she is a total ego maniacal control freak. Ryan Reynolds is also a lot of fun to watch, and he's no different here. The real star of this movie though is Betty White as Andrew's grandmother who's turning 90 over the weekend they come to visit. Of course, I don't think anyone doubted the power of Betty White to steal every scene she's in.

I highly recommend this movie, sure it's somewhat clich, but it's a lot of fun. It's definitely a good movie to just shut off your brain and just enjoy even if you don't typically like romantic comedies.

I found this movie to be completely unconvincing.  Or, rather, too convincing.  Sara Bullock plays a heartless, manipulative witch so believably at the beginning of the movie, that it's just impossible to swallow when she starts warming up to her co-star, as she of course does (beginning in the scene where she starts rubbing his shoulders).

4207089,3,B003UMW69I,"Why is it that Hollywood cannot make a good movie?  This movie follows a pattern that seems to plaque Hollywood--some great jokes and funny scenes in the first half and then a rapid decline into cliche, formula,  and manipulation in the second half.  Every time you see the marginal notes of the script on the screen you are painfully aware of the incompetence of the writers and director.  In case you do not know what I mean concerning marginal notes, watch the scene when Bullock gets in the boat and starts driving at full speed--the notes in the margins of the script will dictate that ""at this moment, Margaret takes control of the situation and reverts to her masculine side, compensating for the emotional (feminine) connection she just felt discussing family with Gramma. This scene needs to move the movie forward by making her vulnerable, especially after she falls into the water and faces her worst fear--not being able to swim (which we made sure to have her mention in the earlier scene).  Let's make sure that she is rescued by the male and then comforted by his strong embrace.  We must make the audience connect to her during this scene, otherwise the rest of the hastily constructed movie won't work!!""
I do not understand why Hollywood needs to emphasize these elements so strongly that it interferes with the viewing of the movie.  As long as Hollywood is crafting jokes the comedies work, but they cannot stop themselves from inserting a strong moral into the movie and this is always the movie's Achilles' heel.  Just watch the first half and you can anticipate how it will end.

4207090,4,B003UMW69I,"This is a nice piece of rom-com fluff at the end of a hard day. As long as you try not to read too much into it. ""The Proposal"" was directed by Anne Fletcher who also directed ""27 Dresses"", a rom-com with cute possibilities but little substance. This movie starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds was an improvement. Sandra Bullock plays Margaret Tate, a hard-nosed book editor Canadian about to be deported who demands her assistant, Andrew Paxton played by Reynolds to marry her. To prove their relationship, they have to go on a weekend with the Paxton family in Alaska where it gets a little silly.

Sandra Bullock always plays a sweetheart and has a Lucille Ball-like clumsiness in her comic arsenal. I fully believed her emotional journey in this movie, but the tough part would have to be believing her being the big bad heartless boss. She was forthright and stern, but she was not exactly Meryl Streep from The Devil Wears Prada and I think that's where she needed to go to really complete that change well.

Ryan Reynolds is usually an actor I detest because 90% of his movies, he plays someone who's a big jerk. He's great at smart ass line delivery but I could never feel for him in those because it just wasn't genuine enough. This movie was a BIG change and he came off as a sweetheart. He had the balls to stand up to his dad about not joining the family business and pursuing his dreams as a writer and editor. This was an older, more mature Ryan Reynolds and I hope this turn in his career keeps up because if it does, I'll be happy to watch many more films from him in the future.

Betty White was hilarious as Grandma Annie. A scene between her and Sandra Bullock doing some sort of tribal dance in the woods was very strange and occasionally awkward but I had to let it go and laugh since Bullock was singing about ""sweat drip down my balls, all you *itches crawl!"" and freak-dancing. Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen were very good ensemble members playing Andrew Paxton's parents.

My favorite off the wall cameo was from Oscar Nunez from The Office. He apparently works every job in this small town - store clerk, minister, exotic dancer. His accent was killing me since he has none in The Office and dancing around with very little clothes.....I just about died laughing because it's such a change from his straight-laced gay accountant character on TV.

So was the writing brilliant? Heck no. The ending of course shouldn't make any sense by any stretch of the imagination in real life. Basically you had a premise, a hook, to bring the audience in and then you have to make it play out somehow. There are lots of funny scenes linked together with a fluffy ending and it's a no-work light movie that will amuse you and relax you at the end of the day. For that, it serves its purpose well.

Grandma Annie is a woman from the hard country before Alaska was a state, and though near death today in a prosperous and tamed Sitka, her memories range widely back to the earliest days of white civilization, when it was just her and a bear, and the man she married long ago.  Her original wedding dress she has kept nicely pressed, in a style that recalls the suffragette age, with a soupcon of Isadora Duncan-inspired flowing robes to give it some classical spice.  For the wealthy Paxton family, Grandma Annie (nicely played by Betty White) is an authentic throwback not only to the days of the pioneers, but to an older people as well--the Indians.  In private she still performs the dances of the First Nations, calling on the spirit of the forests, the totem animals, and the surrounding oceans, to help her dance the way of the female shaman.

Her family life is grim, so she keeps holding on to the dreams and memories, as do many elders in our society.  Her son (or son in law?  We couldn't decide) Joe Paxton, is a bitter tycoon for whom all the money in the world can't heal the thwarted desires in his heart.  His wife, Mary Steenburgen, feels weird when a woman pretty much her own age comes to her mansion and tells her she's engaged to Mary's son, a young stripling who has left the tribe and moved to New York, city of the big steeples.  Grandma Annie goes to the woods and makes tribal noises, having adapted the place to a stage set on which to perform her own performativity as a native woman.  Is she trying to make reparations, in her own quiet way, to the original Native settlers of the Sitka area?  We don't know.  The movie wastes a lot of time on its subplot, which involves the ponytailed city woman (Sandra Bullock) deciding that Alaska life isn't too bad in a hundred story mansion on the top of the hill with every retail outlet in the town bearing your name.

Grandma Annie takes matters into her own hands at the dramatic conclusion, but my wife and I both felt disappointed that her struggles were trivialized, and that she was in the movie to make Sandra Bullock look like a younger actress than she is.

4207100,4,B003UMW69I,"""The Proposal"" is a hilarious romantic comedy because of the fantastic casting.  Betty White steals more than one scene with her hilarious antics and one-liners and Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job of playing the uptight, control-freak boss who's housing a lifetime of pain and vulnerability under her intimidating persona.  It is Ryan Reynolds who gives this familiar we-weren't-supposed-to-fall-in-love-but-we-did plot its refreshing twist.  He is two-thirds leading man with his gorgeous looks and suave demeanor.  But he's one-third comic genius and Mr. Reynolds deftly shows us both sides throughout the whole movie - alternately wooing the female audience with his Cary Grant looks and charm, and then unexpectedly showing the looney comical expressions and antics that his fans have come to love about him.

The reason ""The Proposal"" works so well is because we can relate to the common man-vs.-woman struggle that defines most romantic relationships.  Ms. Bullock's character is one we can identify with - she's strong, capable and desires to be in control, while simultaneously vulnerable and secretly hoping there's a man out there who will really love her enough to put up with her ""stuff"" and not abandon her when he sees her many flaws she desperately tries to hide.

The script is witty, there's wonderful character development as we start to see why each character behaves the way they do - all in all, I thought it was a fresh, witty and totally enjoyable movie - I've seen it 5 times.",1267228800,2,1504,5.114285714285714

Her character is Canadian, and when (in an unlikely twist) Immigration come calling to deport her, on the spur of the moment she enlists her assistant.. to marry her.

On the down side, the plot is both predictable and hard to believe (aside from the unlikely Immigration Officer, there's the eagle carrying away the dog, the Mother Earth grandma chants, not to mention the resolution).  It's one of those movies you watch with a faint smile crossing your face now and again, and afterwards you remember it had a few funny moments...  but that's about the extent of the impact it has, mostly because it takes too long to show any likeable side to either of the characters, so that in the end the will-they won't-they aspect hardly matters.  All you're left with then is the humour from the various fish-out-of-water gags as Bullock's high heeled cosmopolitan comes to terms with the wilderness and what it means to have a real family.  If harmless rom-com with no brain engaged, but perhaps some nice scenery is what you're after, then by all means rent.. but this is really quite disposable fluff, devoid of the chemistry or `je ne sais quois' that makes these things truly sparkle.
Scrapes a pass mark, but only if you're a Bullock fan, and even then only because the Alaskan scenery was nice.",1267056000,7,2130,4.779291553133515

I liked this movie a lot.  Bullock is talented, mature, and naturally funny and Reynolds is very likable.  On the down side, Bullock almost looks old enough to be his mother and that was a bit distracting.  The story has certainly been done before, but the actors' charm makes it feel fresh and Betty White provides some really belly laughs.

STARRING: Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds, Craig. T. Nelson, Mary Steenburgen, Betty White, Dennis O'Hare, Malin Akerman and Oscar Nunez

WRITTEN BY: Pete Chiarelli

DIRECTED BY: Anne Fletcher

Rated: PG-13
Genre: Romantic Comedy
Release Date: 19 June 2009

The Proposal was easily one of the best romantic comedies of the year and only gets better with a second viewing.

Sandra Bullock stars as an absolute tyrant of a boss, named Margaret Tate. I didn't even have to use [...] to verify this was her name, because I vividly remember her co-star Ryan Reynolds quoting it, so humorously in the film.

Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton and there is only one thing in the world keeping him from achieving his dream of being an editor: Margaret Tate. While she will never admit it, she knows he is the best personal assistant she could ever hope to find. Thus, she neglects to ever award him with even so much as the slightest bit of praise.

That's all about to change however, when Margaret is threatened to be deported back to Canada; disqualifying her eligibility to work for an American company.

The screenwriter brilliantly has Andrew step into the room during this unfortunate meeting, to relay a message to Margaret with the word `proposal' attached. A light bulb goes off and Margaret drags Andrew into the meeting, informing her employers she and Andrew are to be married, that very weekend.

Andrew's reaction to hearing this is hilarious as he realizes she will crush him if he does not go along. The scene only gets funnier from there, when they ask Andrew where the wedding will be held and Margaret is shocked to realize they are going to - Alaska, of all places.

Finally, Andrew is in a place to negotiate for a promotion to editor. He threatens to walk from pretending to be Margaret's fianc, unless he's promoted to editor. Margaret regrettably agrees and their employer tells her all will be forgotten once they are married.

All they have to do is convince Andrew's family and a pesky customs and integrations official who is tracking their every move, that the wedding is legit.

The movie is cleverly written and directed and has some great scenes that move us and make us smile. In particularly, the scenes involving Margaret interacting with Andrew's family, who consists of great performances by Craig T. Nelson, Betty White and Mary Steenburgen. Everyone has amazing chemistry together, and the characters are portrayed wonderfully.

Even though I am a guy, I can admit this is a funny flick that any dude with substance, will enjoy watching on the couch with his lady.",1266105600,,2602,4.857466063348416
4207106,4,B003UMW69I,"Sandra Bullock was a hot commodity in 2009. This is a very attractive comedy, with locations in New York and Alaska; a terrific cast in Ryan Reynolds (Wolverine, Definitely Maybe, Van Wilder), Mary Steenburgen (Four Christmases, Back To The Future Part III), Craig T. Nelson (The Incredibles, Coach), and Betty White (The Golden Girls, The Mary Tyler Moore Show); and a pretty good script. A couple that starts out hating each other and ends up loving each other is a good formula, as some of the most famous comedies - like The Philadelphia Story - and even dramas - such as Gone With The Wind - prove. In this case, Bullock is Reynold's slave-driver publishing boss, whom everyone fears and loathes, but Reynolds especially. When it looks like Bullock is going to be deported back to Canada because of an immigration problem, she blackmails Reynolds into marrying her, in spite of their age difference. Things really heat up when he takes her home to Alaska to meet his family, with an immigration official hot on their trail.

I'll never understand why comedy writers and directors always include at least one tasteless scene in their films. In this case, it's the performance by local male stripper Ramone, played by Oscar Nunez. It's as if they want to make sure we realize that they don't respect us, so they give us a scene that you would have to be trailer trash to appreciate. Then there's the obligatory skin scene, which in this case involves the totally unbelievable coincidence of both Bullock and Reynolds being naked, slamming into each other, and ending up on the floor together. Of course, they still hate each other at this point, so they're not supposed to like it. And finally, as a tribute to bad TV, we have a bizarre scene with Betty White in the middle of the woods dressed in Indian garb, chanting to Mother Nature, with Sandra Bullock contributing to the ceremony by singing and dancing to the dirty lyrics of a rap song. In spite of these idiotic inclusions, this is a very likable film, primarily because, what's not to like about Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. PG-13

4207111,4,B003UMW69I,"A cute little flick, this movie begins with Sandra Bullock (aka Miss Tate/Margaret/Maggie) hustling to get to work, as is her Executive Assistant/Secretary (Andrew).  Miss Tate is Editor-in-Chief of Ruick and Hunt Publishing, a New York book publisher.  Maggie is so loved by those who work for her that as she arrives, they are all emailing each other announcing ""It's here!""  ""The witch is on her broom"" is the intraoffice email signal that means Maggie is on the move through the office.  Maggie is a Canadian citizen, working for a U.S. firm, awaiting her U.S. visa.

As Maggie enters her office, she finds Andrew standing at attention, holding her Starbuck's Venti something-or-other flavor. Very quickly into the movie, Maggie is summoned to her boss' office and advised that her visa was denied and she is about to be deported.  She had left the U.S. while the visa was being applied for and had violated the rules, so the application was denied.  Well, now that's a fine kettle of fish!  She cannot reapply for a year and cannot work for a U.S. company while she is deported.  Out of desperation, she announces that her and Andrew are getting married!

Maggie tells Andy they will work it out and get a quickie divorce later.  When they head to immigration, the investigating agent explains they must return the following week and be prepared to answer questions about each other and had better know the answer!  Andy is a little scared but he wants to keep his job and hopes to become an editor, so...

Off they go to meet his family for the weekend, in Sitka, Alaska!  It turns out the family has some money and a gorgeous home.  Maggie arrives like a princess without her kingdom, stumbling around and walking over stones in heels and climbing dock ladders in a full-skirted dress.  We get to see a few nice pictures of Alaska, too.

Andy's family includes Betty White as his adoring and lively Grandom, Mary Steenburgen as his loving Mom, and the guy who played ""The Coach"" as the father he doesn't get along with so well.  Dad wanted Andy to take over the family business, but Andy went off to NYC.  Andy is an only child.

The whole family looks at Maggie as ""not for Andy"" and his ""engagement"" is a huge surprise to all, but Mom and Grandmom welcome Maggie to the family.  It is a cute and funny movie and there are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments.  I heard myself making loud noises off and on.  Although I cannot say it was a ""5"", I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Is it a chick flick?  No, I think the guys would enjoy this movie a lot.

4207115,4,B003UMW69I,"This is another movie my wife picked out, and I decided to give it a try.  It's basically a light romantic comedy, and the best word to describe it is 'cute'.

The plot isn't quite believable and the characters are somewhat exaggerated, but the movie is still generally well-crafted, so you won't really notice these issues if you approach the movie with the attitude of having fun.  The acting is also fairly solid, and the lead actors can be counted among 'the beautiful people'.

Though there's no pretense of this being a deep movie, I was still able to discern four messages: (a) people who don't seem nice might have had a rough background, (b) sons should usually follow their passion in choosing their career path, even when their fathers have other ideas, (c) relationships are more important than money, and (d) romantic love can happen unexpectedly.

Betty White stole the movie -- she was great.  I was very disappointed in Sandra Bullock doing a nude scene -  she's too good of an actress to have to do that.  She is the boss lady and her visa is up so she needs to either marry an American or be deported.  Naturally, the latter is not to her liking so she enlists the (unwilling) assistance of her assistant.  As part of the ploy they have to visit his family for his grandmother's birthday (played by Betty White).  At first his family is a little too country for the sophisticated boss lady but as she gets to know them, she takes another look at her too structured and perfect life and decides that she likes them.  The usual last minute detractors pop up but all's well that ends well.  Sandra Bullock could have done better.",1264550400,2,932,4.366279069767442

4207119,3,B003UMW69I,"Although entertaining to a point, there are too many similarities to other comedies to make THE PROPOSAL anything but ordinary.

Most notably I found the plot to be very similar to another, older Sandra Bullock movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/While-You-Were-Sleeping/dp/6304765266/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">While You Were Sleeping</a>. But this time we have an accomplice in the deceit and he's not in a coma. Seriously. Think about it...

A woman who is in need of something (in this case a need NOT to be deported) comes up with a plan to achieve that goal (whether by accident -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/While-You-Were-Sleeping/dp/6304765266/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">While You Were Sleeping</a>&nbsp;- or not - The Proposal). Girl falls for the wrong guy. Guy falls for wrong girl. Family gets fooled. Girl confesses and thinks she's lost everything. Guy chases down girl with the approval of the family. Everyone lives happily ever after. Ta-da!

The entertainment value in the film comes from the first half of the movie in which we have plenty of comedic zingers flying about, including quite a few from Grandma Annie (Betty White) while trying to dress Margaret (Sandra Bullock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lake-House/dp/B000HLDFK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lake House</a>) in a wedding dress and losing - then finding - her breasts.

The cast is good in their respective roles, including main love interest Ryan Reynolds (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smokin-Aces/dp/B002VEJKQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smokin' Aces</a>) playing Andrew Paxton, a sort of rich boy playing poor boy in order to tick-off his father, Joe, played by Craig T. Nelson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Family-Stone/dp/B000EMGJ72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Family Stone</a>). Nelson just seems to be going through the motions during the entire film and never really gains any traction. As does Mary Steenburgen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dead-Girl/dp/B000MTFFO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dead Girl</a>) who plays Reynold's mother.

The other problem with the casting is that we just don't get that romantic air between Bullock and Reynolds' characters. She is obviously much older than him (can you say ""cougar?""), which isn't always a problem but, again, there just didn't seem much attraction going on. They fight, argue and never really resolve anything before miraculously falling in love ...because of one kiss?

Let's get real...

Even with these flaws, the comedic timing is excellent and the visual backdrops of Boston and the (supposed) Alaskan countryside can take one's breath away. Also, the Paxton family house is stunning to see.

Looking for something original? Not here. Want a fantastic romance story? Not here either. Looking for something entertaining, funny, and visual appealing? Give this one a try.",1264291200,5,3103,6.644444444444445
4207120,5,B003UMW69I,"What a pleasant surprise this movie was. Leading woman & man Sandra Bullock & Ryan Reynolds deftly elevate this romantic comedy above what could have been standard formula fare. Bullock plays Margaret, a pretty but not-so-likable book editor who's all aggression & job focus; Reynolds plays Andrew, her dependable but secretly miserable secretary who jumps when she snaps her fingers. You practically know these characters' thoughts just by reading their faces: Margaret is brazenly indifferent to Andrew, who pretty much uses him as her doormat; Andrew quietly detests her, thinking she's the Wicked Witch of the West (or in this case, East). But all that changes when she's notified that her green card is invalid & she's going to be deported back to Canada. Suddenly, her entire future is in jeopardy. What to do? Simple---she grabs her secretary & informs her boss that they're engaged! The subtle confusion in Reynolds' eyes as they slowly convey panic is fun to watch. Under the scrutiny of an externally tough but wimpy deportation officer, Margaret is whisked away by her ""fiancee"" (after he blackmails her into a job promotion to secure his participation) to Sitka, Alaska to meet the well-off Paxton family, hoping to successfully break the news, have a ""quickie marriage"", then divorce later & go their separate ways. Naturally, during the course of events with the Paxtons, these two ""working strangers"" finally get to know each other for the first time, and what was all ""pretend"" becomes quite real & genuine.
The supporting cast is top notch: Craig T. Nelson & Mary Steenburgen are dependable as always as Andrew's parents; Michael Nouri, offering his cool presence (all too briefly) as Margaret's boss; and then there's the wonderful Betty White, still feisty & a natural scene-stealer well into her 80's. There are some great comic moments in the film---the bird of prey snatching up the family pooch (then Margaret's phone); Margaret's embarrassing ""bachelorette party"" with the girls as she's entertained by ""Chippendales reject"" Ramone; and the humiliating ""running into each other naked"" scene, to name a few.
Not an Oscar-winner, by any means. But Bullock & Reynolds play off each other so well in this that they are worth the watch. And besides, there are worse ways to spend your time than by not watching this engaging romantic comedy.",1264291200,2,2360,5.10077519379845

4207126,3,B003UMW69I,"I enjoy romantic comedies more than most would admit.  And I heard about this one, and thought the concept sounded interesting (boss and her employee pretending to be married).  Of course we all know what would happen from that point on, but I still thought this could be likable, since it was such a big hit and a lot of people had nice things to say about it.  Unfortunately, I felt like I was let down.

I will start by saying that there are quite a few things to like about this movie, which made me debate over giving it 3 or 4 stars.  For one, Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have really good chemistry, and their scenes of bantering and getting each other into uncomfortable situations are some of the best parts of the movie.  Reynold's character is very likable, and almost anybody can understand where he's coming from.  Furthermore, Betty White still shows that she can make the most of an otherwise unimportant role, and is probably one of the best actors in the movie.

But with all that being said and done, I have to tell you that the flaws are too glaring to ignore.  The biggest, perhaps, is that Bullock's character, Margaret, is not someone you like at all.  She's the stereotypical boss from Hell, which would be okay if the script showed the other side to her better.  The best we get is when she reveals she cried when someone called her a ""poisonous [b-word]"" by a worker she just fired.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't feel sorry for people who hurt others getting a taste of their own medicine.  Furthermore, the two of them don't really fall in love for any other reason than they feel sorry for each other (Margaret is alone in the world, Reynolds' Alex has a bad relationship with his family), which is not satisfying enough of a reason for me.  And as I said earlier, this film largely rips off the movies Devil Wears Prada (evil boss), Meet the Parents (awkward meeting of future in-laws), and While You Were Sleeping (lonely girl with no family is welcomed into one she deceives).

To sum it all up, this is a movie that will entertain you, but it will also frustrate you by the time it's over.  I don't understand how this movie can make so many big mistakes when it does so many little things right, but it did somehow.",1263600000,4,2254,4.434466019417476
4207127,3,B003UMW69I,"Synopsis:  Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is a domineering executive whom no one likes because of her cold and often cruel personality.  Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds)is her entirely-dominated assistant, who has the task of doing whatever she wants when she wants it.  When Margaret is threatened to be deported back to her native Canada due her visa status, she proposes that Andrew that they have a sham-marriage so she can stick around.  Andrew is reluctant at first, but sees what he can get out of the deal from her (namely, getting his work published).  They fly from New York to Andrew's native Alaska to see his grandmother (Betty White) for her 90th birthday and to inform his family about their plans to get married.  Although Andrew's father Joe (Craig T. Nelson) is skeptical, his mother Grace (Mary Steenburgen) is ecstatic and surprises the couple by making their marriage plans for them in Alaska.  Though initially cold to everything going on around her, Margaret begins to see how well she's accepted by Andrew's family and it starts to open the floodgates for her as to why she's so emotionally distant, which allows her to admit to herself that she genuinely loves Andrew.  Will she go on with the marriage, or will the guilt drive her to admit that she's trying to pull of a scam?

There were a lot of fun moments in the film and up to the ending I was excited to see what would happen.  But then the ending took a somewhat un-climactic turn into predictability.  I don't want to discuss it because I don't want to give it away, but had the ending been done differently from the wedding scene to the finish, I may have gotten more enjoyment out of it than what I did.  It was like the movie forsake the budding chemistry between the two leads to throw out an ending that would be easier to spell out for the audience.

Be that as it may, Bullock and Reynolds were just awesome together, the cinematography itself was great, and the overall comedy was definitely there.  People who would be less-particular than I am about the film's ending probably loved it because aside from that, it was a good time.

4207128,4,B003UMW69I,"THE PROPOSAL as written by Pete Chiarelli and directed by Anne Fletcher looks on the surface (posters, promos. trailer) like yet another version of tough woman manipulates subservient guy in a toss that ends up in a role reversal.  And in many ways that is what this film is about: hard-as-rocks but beautiful editor Margaret (Sandra Bullock) verbally abuses her assistant, wannabe author Andrew (Ryan Reynolds), until her employers discover her visa is expired and she is to be deported to her native Canada. A fast thought drives her to claim that she and Andrew are engaged in a ploy to avoid deportation.  Shocked at first, Andrew decides to make this ultimate blow to his ego work for him and takes Margaret to his home in Sitka, Alaska to meet his family  - mother (Mary Steenburgen), father (Craig T.

Of course in the beauty of Alaska and under the influence of the warmth of a family Margaret never had, the expected  magic happens and ... you know the rest.

Sandra Bullock is good and creates a solid character, but it is Ryan Reynolds who proves his chops as one of the best comedic actors on the screen today.  It is a fun outing.

4207130,4,B003UMW69I,"This is a clever, funny, engaging comedy with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.  Because it is light-hearted and a predictable script, the romantic comedy would be best enjoyed by die-hard Sandra Bullock fans.  Bullock plays a career-driven, Top Publisher, Margaret Tate who also happens to be a Canadian citizen.  She is denied a visa and does not want to be sent back to Canada as it will ruin her career in the U.S.A.  Her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) has taken her whims and gruff treatment as a way to get into the publishing business.  In a very funny scene she is meeting with her superiors and realizes she can become a citizen if she marries an American Citizen.  She grabs her assistant Andrew and announces they are engaged.  She forces him to become her fiancee, and he goes along with it for other reasons.  He has a trip to Alaska planned and she goes with him to prove to U.S. Immigration that this is a valid marriage.  Betty White plays ""grandma"" and is delightful spirit.

The acting and comedic timing is fun to watch - and the film is predictable but the film gives a great and funny entertaining two hours.",1263254400,2,1139,4.594059405940594

4207132,4,B003UMW69I,"Already a big hit (more than $ 160 million) in the US alone, ""The Proposal"" offers exactly what you expect from a romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock. A (proposed) marriage of convenience turns into something different as the reluctant partners are forced to live together. You might want to know the film is helmed by Anne Fletcher known for her ""Step up"" and ""27 Dresses.""

Margaret (Sandra Bullock) is an executive editor of a New York book publishing company - and she is not the most popular person in the company, a little tamer version of Miranda, the character Meryl Streep played in ""The Devil Wears Prada."" And now she is in trouble. Learning that she is being deported to Canada (where she came from), Margaret says before her employer that in fact she and her long-suffering assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) are getting married.

Andrew agrees to the fraudulent marriage on condition that he will get promoted. She accepts it, but there is still a big problem. Margaret and Andrew both have to prove that their marriage is not a fake before the immigration agent Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare). So they fly to Andrew's home in Sitka, Alaska, where Margaret is welcomed by his family - and of course, none of the family members, Andrew's mother Grace (Mary Steenburgen), father Joe (Craig T. Nelson) and Granma Annie (Betty White) knows nothing about the truth.

The premise of ""The Proposal"" is slightly reminiscent of such films as ""Green Card."" In fact, the storyline of ""The Proposal"" sounds familiar to those fans who love old-fashioned Hollywood films. Someone you hate most turns out to be your perfect match. The difference is the film's sexual content (I am talking about the slapstick-like semi-nude scene of Sandra Bullock) and the ""question-and-answer"" scenes at the end credit, as well as some funny comedic set-pieces involving a dog and a cell phone snatched by an eagle.

While the premise is contrived and the story predictable, the chemistry between the two stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds is palpable and believable. The second half is weak (like most romantic comedies), but ""The Proposal"" is still an enjoyable romantic comedy thanks to the leading stars.",1262736000,,2197,4.978201634877384

Not to mention I've lived in Alaska since 1996 and have a great career as a businesswoman. Yes, I can be ""a witch on the broom,"" too... I could totally relate to it! Proposal is a great story, very true to reality (no, we don't live in igloos and are part of the US) and the actors were incredibly talented and funny and conveyed that spirit of New York vs. Alaska, good family boy vs. independent business lady, and the level of stupidity and humiliation immigration can put you through.  I was glad that my daughters could watch it, too (a few moments of nudity and a lot of respect and romance).

Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are well matched in slight romantic comedy. It was refreshing that this movie delivered even more fun than expected. This movie is very well written and directed. It also had much more than just laughs. A must see.",1262131200,2,606,5.121212121212121
4207138,3,B003UMW69I,"The Proposal is a ""chick flick,"" that follows many of the genre's conventions. Tough publishing executive Sandra Bullock faces deportation from the U.S. So, she forces her assistant (Ryan Reynolds) to become engaged to her because the marriage will help keep her in the country. The evil immigration authorities are suspicious of Bullock's motives for the marriage.

If you can overcome the unbelievable premise, this movie is a lot of fun. Bullock and Reynolds go to Alaska to meet his family. Bullock and Reynolds grate on each other's nerves. But then... well, you can probably guess what happens next.

This film is sort like an extended version of a sitcom. The cast is excellent; the duo of Bullock and Reynolds works well as an on-screen couple. The movie also includes some gorgeous scenery from Alaska.

The script involves the typical, ridiculous twists and turns that one finds in romantic comedies. There are some very silly moments in the film, particularly in a scene in which Bullock lets the family dog out of the house. Viewers will have to enjoy the film in spite of the obvious facts that none of this stuff could ever happen and no one behaves in a way that is very realistic.

The Proposal is good for viewers who want a few laughs and simple escapism.",1262131200,2,1273,4.7727272727272725

None of the actors/actresses played their roles well. Betty White's character was a typical Betty White character but silly to the point of ridiculous. The tribal scene in the woods was pointless.

4207151,4,B003UMW69I,"Sandra Bullock is a fairly decent actress and it shows well in this movie.  She comes close to playing a dominant boss but not quite the same as some of the critters I worked for from an earlier life.  Her assistant is a real flunky and needed little help commanding his role.  The development of the story was easy and smooth and not exactly easy to predetermine the outcome.  The scenery is just plain fantastic and I would love to live in a community such as that one.  It is so nice to sit down for a few frames and watch a movie that does not make you think too much or contain too much violence et al.  This is just a friendly movie that most adults could enjoy.

One item that stressed my humble mind is attempting to ascertain the difference between Blu-ray (BD) and regular DVD disks.  Some suggest that Blu-ray provides a picture and sound that is 6 times better than regular DVD.  That is an exageration of at least 4 to 5.  Maybe the old eyes and ears cannot tell the difference.  Maybe regular will suffice for home theaters.",1260748800,,1038,4.3264248704663215
4207152,4,B003UMW69I,"Anyone who has seen Greencard or any other movie where the main characters are at odds and forced together, can pretty much figure out the direction of this movie.  That doesn't mean it is fun nonetheless.  Bullock plays a tough New York book editor (Margaret) that has the whole office cringing in fear of her.  Reynolds plays her pandering assistant (Andrew) who will do anything to be promoted to editor and get his book published.

Though Andrew is like a ""servant"" around Margaret he lets the rest of the world (the office and his family) how much he hates her.  He even sends broadcast  text messages to the staff, each time Margaret approaches.  Through a bad judgement by Margaret to land an interview overseas, Imigration has revoked her visa (she is a Canadian) and will be deporting her.  Not only that, she will not be able to return to the US for at least a year, which would effectively nix her editior job.

Desperate, she hatches a scheme where she and Andrew are getting married.  She then has to make a lot a concessions to him so he will go along with the plan and convince immigration.  What follows is that Margaret has to travel with Andrew to a family birthday party and Andrew is not who she thought he was.

It takes a while into the movie for some let up to Margaret's ""Dragon Lady"" personality.  A lot gets helped along by Andrew's grandmother (Betty White) and mother (Mary Steenburgen) who both put in ""A"" performances.  The movie never gets too campy like some of Reynolds prior films, instead the level of humor is about right (maybe along the lines of The Devil Wears Prada).

This is one of the better comedies I have seen this year, a good ""date"" flick.",1260576000,,1687,4.539735099337748

As such, it has very little of the girly charm found in many of her earlier movies.  I think, and my wife agrees, it is still an entertaining romantic comedy as only Sandra Bullock can accomplish.

4207157,1,B003UMW69I,"I'm sorry, but this movie was SUCH a disappointment.  If you have seen ""While You Were Sleeping"" (which I loved), then you have essentially already seen ""The Proposal"".  It is almost entirely the same plot, with the insertion of some ""wacky"" (read: out of place and completely contrived) antics, and--I swear--almost the exact same dialogue in parts (e.g. the wedding scene where Bullock stops the ceremony and gives the speech about how this groom she's messing with has such a great family and she just got caught up in that?  Sound familiar?  Yeah.  Almost identical to the scene in ""While You Were Sleeping"" which could be described in the exact same manner.)

Switch out Bullock's sweet, unassuming, and poverty-stricken Lucy in ""...Sleeping"" for a mean, selfish, and filthy-rich lady in ""The Proposal"" and you have pretty much the same film, although--again--comedic antic-laden scenes which were charming in ""...Sleeping"" (e.g. the slipping around on the icy sidewalk scene) are replaced with forced, unfunny scenes that leave you cringing (e.g. the tribal dancing with the grandma where Bullock starts rapping).

The only way she can think to get out of it is to get married, to her assistant (Ryan Reynolds). The assistant decideds to go along with a few demands of his own, one of which is a promotion. With the news of the marriage, a sneaky immigration clerk tries to get proof that the marriage is fake. Bullock and Reynolds try to show off the marriage to his family in Alaska to have some proof.

But this, this was about the most boring movie I ever saw.  I kept fast forwarding it, hoping it would get better or thinking about turning it off, and finally it came to and end. Thank goodness.  I put it back in the little box and slipped it down below in the cupboard with other movies I didn't like, hated or some boring re-runs.

The plot is ridiculous, made no sense.  The characters were ridiculous and made no sense.  In fact, the whole movie made no sense.  You've probably read the plot somewhere, so I won't bother to run through it, but unless you love bad farce, don't buy it.

4207187,4,B003UMW69I,"When not handling his business in superhero cinema, Ryan Reynolds tends to roam into the comedy genre. THE PROPOSAL is his latest romantic comedy and this time he plays opposite Sandra Bullock, an actress I used to follow onscreen, but not lately. Sandra Bullock made an impression on me with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0006GANOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speed (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/While-You-Were-Sleeping/dp/6304765266/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">While You Were Sleeping</a>, and even with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Demolition-Man/dp/630460288X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Demolition Man</a>, but all those flicks are more than a few years ago and, somewhere along the way, I just stopped watching her. Here, she goes against type but manages to bring back all the elements which had originally made her so endearing.

It's about tyrannical, much-loathed book editor Margaret Tate suddenly learning that she's on the verge of being deported back to Canada. Grasping at straws, she bullies her long-suffering assistant Andrew Paxton into pretending that they're engaged, their upcoming ""nuptials"" the key to her remaining in New York. It's not too long before things get crazy out of hand, and Margaret finds herself flying out to Sitka, Alaska on a weekend trip with Andrew to celebrate his grandma's birthday. So cue the usual romantic stuff, with a very suspicious immigration officer closely keeping tabs on the pretend relationship.

Thing is, there's nothing new in this one. THE PROPOSAL is actually a by-the-numbers picture with a contrived premise, and so, as it often turns out, whether the film sinks or swims hinges on the compatibility and appeal of the two leads. I have friends who don't dig Reynolds, and nowadays I rarely get swayed by Bullock's charms. But I happen to think that these two actors, in this movie, click together. The mutual dislike of their characters is palpable and very enjoyable, and, honestly, there's nothing quite so exquisite as when two people who really don't like each other end up crashing into each other while both are bare-nekkid. Returning to the down side, predictable sub-plots wing its way towards you and, by gum, there's even that most cliched of cliches: a frantic, last-minute dash to the airport. I was amused, but not too startled at the revelations regarding Margaret. We all suspected, going in, that she just had to have a softer side. And to check off on the ""endearing character quirk"" angle, Margaret happens to harbor a hidden fondness for rap music - and specifically for Lil Jon and Rob Bass & DJ E-Z Rock. That's sweet.

By now, Ryan Reynolds has this kind of role down pat. The bemused look, the pinched expression, the deadpan delivery, he's a natural at all that stuff. Several of his insults directed at Bullock are very funny. His character also has a side story centering on his bitter estrangement from his father. Mostly, though, Reynolds serves as the framing device with which to show off Sandra Bullock's pretty good performance. I've never seen Bullock in a mean dragon lady part (it's like seeing Norman Rockwell beat up a child), but I must say she's surprisingly effective and convincing and callous as heck. It's almost a shame that this particular genre demands that she eventually demonstrate a warmer, more vulnerable side to her. I was getting a kick out of her being this icy, horrifically insensitive boss.

THE PROPOSAL will have you wallowing in despised boss revenge fantasies and just maybe, even fantasies of a near nude Sandra Bullock, who may be in her forties now but, dang, she shows off a sexy bod. Okay, some of the scenes are cringe-worthy, the two most embarassing ones probably being the bachelorette party dude stripper dance and Betty White doing some sort of uncomfortable tribal dance. But this last one actually becomes funny when Betty asks Sandra Bullock to join in, and Sandra - well, you just have to see it.

4207192,1,B003UMW69I,"I've seen Ryan Reynolds in movies in which he was charming and funny. He was great as the comic relief in the 3rd or 4th Blade movie, as an example, and Sandra Bullock can pull off a certain kind of role as well. She used to bring a fresh, sassy forthright appeal of her own, but in this film neither of them brings any of their strengths. Bullock looks pinched throughout and not like she's ""in character,"" but as though she's wondering how the heck she ended up in this train wreck, and all of Reynolds' comedic gifts seem to be stifled. It felt like they both were acting with restraint. Not sure where that came from? Maybe the writing, which wasn't great, or the directing, but wherever it originated, it really held the movie back. I also found the movie's premise unlikely at best and the idea that one is going to do NYC to Sitka, Alaska and back in a weekend to be preposterous. But the real problem was that the characters did not behave believably in the end. What comes before needs to build to a believable resolution, and the idea that one highly stressful weekend together was going to cause these two characters to fall in love was beyond absurd. Each step of the way you could see how it wasn't adding up more and more that they should be together at all. There just was no reason presented for why they would suddenly turn their feelings around. I'd compare this movie to one Bullock did a few years ago called ""While You Were Sleeping."" In it she was engaged to one man while secretly falling in love with his brother and each step of the way you could see how and why she belonged with him rather then with the man she was engaged to. There was none of that slow build happening here at all, so when the ending came you weren't happily satisfied that all turned out as it should, but rather jarred and left thinking this is ridiculous because there's no way these two belong together. And sadly, we saw Bullock do the ""I can't marry him under these circumstances"" thing far better in ""While You Were Sleeping."" Did no one realize she'd done the exact same scene before in that movie? Clearly there are a great many people who love Bullock no matter what and apparently rom-com no matter how bad, and more power to them, but this movie was painful to watch in my view and a complete waste of time.",1258502400,11,2316,4.375870069605568

Don't know about the rest of you but I'm tired of seeing images of feckless males in movies and The Proposal was a breath of fresh air in this regard.  I found the pairing of a younger man with an obviously older woman a delightful twist because the movie showed them both getting past age issues and finding each other's underlying qualities and beautiful hearts.

4207198,4,B003UMW69I,"I used to love romantic comedies until the past couple of years where the quality of writing and acting has left much to be desired. So when my dear husband brought this home one night, I was quite skeptical, thinking I wasn't going to enjoy it. Well, I was wrong! ""The Proposal"" is a well-cast and credibly acted romantic comedy with two leads that share genuine chemistry and an ensemble cast that is quite simply a delight to watch.

Sandra Bullock whom I have enjoyed watching in movies like ""While you were sleeping"" (and which I consider an all-time classic) and ""Practical Magic"" plays a tough as nails editor, Margaret, who is reviled by her underlings. Margaret faces a predicament when her visa expires (she is a Canadian) and faces the unpleasant prospect of being deported. She comes up with a quick fix solution - tell her boss and others that she is engaged to her assistant, an aspiring author, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds)who is forced to go along with her plans under threat of losing his job and never being published. Before long, the pair find themselves heading to the scenic Sitka, Alaska, a beautiful seaside town where Andrew's family lives. Turns out Andrew's family is not only prominent but very wealthy, comprising dad Joe (Craig T. Nelson), mom Grace (Mary Steenburgen) and grandma Annie (Betty White, still at her feisty best). Andrew's family embrace Margaret, though Joe is cynical of their romance and is hell bent on keeping Andrew on Sitka, to take over the Paxton empire after his retirement.

Typical of other romantic comedies, the pair soon discover common ground, and Margaret's ice queen veneer slowly thaws, and the rest of the story deals with the pair's romantic misadventures and conclusion. What made this an engaging and fun watch was the believable chemistry between Reynolds and Bullock - they truly seem at ease with each other, be it whilst engaged in verbal sparring or easy, casual banter. Betty White hams it up as Grandma Annie, and Mary Steenburgen and Craig T Nelson play their roles with conviction. The cinematography is beautiful and the dialogue is well-written, resulting in many genuinely laugh out loud moments. This is a wonderful romantic comedy that is sure to brighten up a listless, gloomy day. Highly recommended!",1258156800,2,2284,4.92987012987013

I assumed the movie would be fun but I didn't expect it to be this much fun. This is clearly because I've never that I can recall seen Sandra Bullock before and my, what I've missed! Good though Ryan Reynolds is, Bullock is outstanding in this movie, and now I've seen some more of her movies, I realise just how extremely good she is even if some of the movies she's starred in haven't been as good as she deserves. But all of them I've seen now have been very enjoyable as she clearly has the ability to lift even somewhat inferior material.

The story is fairly standard romcom, although the frequent old theme of difficult man and putupon or ignored younger woman is neatly reversed - I understand Bullock is older than Reynolds, and that works extremely well - it makes a nice change in fiction although in real life it seems more and more relationships are older woman-younger man these days.

I still find it interesting that the overwhelming majority of movies, it is the guy that has most of the power (in spite of her being his boss - if you see the movie you will see what I mean).  For once I'd like to see the opposite - yet that I fear is not to be.  Women still want to be taken care of and having it go the other way around makes the guy weak (even though he may provide support for her in other ways - maybe even more important and deeper ways (being a good father, caring, supportive, tender, etc)).

That aside-

I'm a big Sandra Bullock fan.  I'll watch anything with her in it because she is such a charming actress- unfortunately this means I've watched alot of really bad movies- she can really pick some stinkers, can't she?  This wasn't as good as Miss Congeniality but oodles better than The Net or While You Were Sleeping - this is more in the Two Weeks Notice vein, but without the preachy politics that tainted that film.

Is the movie predictable?  Of course.  All romantic comedies are predictable- that's what it means to work in a genre.  But it uses the tools of the genre well, and was well done.

Reynolds and Bullock worked pretty well together in this film as far as the playful bickering went (I'm finding myself a bigger fan of Reynolds now) and Betty White, as always, was entertaining.  But it was missing something and I feel it was lacking a bit on the romantic side.  That was really the only thing I was disappointed in, was that I wasn't totally convinced at the end of the movie that either one of them had fallen for each other.  It still seemed like a business deal between them.  And Sandra Bullocks eyes bothered me in this film.  They just didn't look right for some reason.

4207215,3,B003UMW69I,"While it has some very humorous moments, this movie was weak in the romance department.

One major point was that Sandra Bullock seemed a bit old to be paired with her leading man. Now, I have no idea of their actual ages, but even the grandma in the movie (who did a great job, by the way) mentions, upon meeting her, that Sandra Bullock is no 'girl'. Ryan Reynolds' ex even seems years younger than Bullock.

Now, I'm not saying that the woman must be younger than the man or anything like that. It's just that, other than Grandma's remarks, it was not something that was really brought up.  It just seemed like something that his family would have questioned, at least a little.

It was still easy to see how Andrews (Reynolds) fell in love with Margaret (Bullock). I mean, he knew everything about her, almost, and learned even more during the weekend. All Bullock seemed to fall in love with was Andrew's family. She never did seem to really learn anything about him. In one scene, she finally shows some interest by asking him about his father. When Andrew refuses to answer, she talks about herself some more. I thought, ""Okay, he's finally going to open up a bit."" Nope, he just talks about her some more and that's it.

The 'look' saved this movie. Both Bullock and Reynolds were able to give and get that 'look' that says, ""Oh, I think I'm falling in love with this person.""

Bullock trying to feed the dog to the eagle was the absolute funniest scene in the movie. ;-)",1257552000,,1479,4.479553903345725
4207216,5,B003UMW69I,"Okay, this movie delivered what it intended---a lighthearted, frivolous, romantic comedy. Sure, it is riddled with cliche, after cliche, and you have to suspend disbelief regarding some of the silly plotting, but I found it to be simply irresistible. It's been a while, since I have actually laughed out loud at a movie. A grin, maybe, but not teary-eyed, laughter; this film had me doing so in several scenes. It has also been a while since I have wanted to watch ANY movie more than once, but I'm ready to watch this one again.

Sandra Bullock is adorable. It's a mystery to me, how she appears to grow more attractive with each movie.  Totally unfair!  If the ladies out there make their male partners, or friends, sit through this (mostly) 'chick flick,' they won't be disappointed, either.  They will be rewarded by watching Bullock in some revealing situations we haven't seen her in before.  Fortunately, they were handled with such fun and class, as would be expected from Bullock. However, the movie IS PG13 for sexual content, nudity, and language, so it is not for the younger audience.

It is clear that Bullock and Reynolds are friends, because their chemistry together shines through. And, the secondary characters often share the spotlight. Betty White is as feisty and clever as ever, and such a complement to this film.  I think she had a lot of fun doing this one; she radiates joy.

If you like the cast, and view this movie for what it is, you should have 108 minutes of true escapism, fun.  Enjoy!",1257292800,8,1518,4.71969696969697

If you're the type of person who watches a romantic comedy and rolls their eyes thinking ""This is so predictable"" then you shouldn't watch movies like this. For everyone else, this is a fun movie with some great characters. Sandra Bullock doesn't get enough credit for her acting abilities. She does a terrific job here. I would say it's her second best romantic comedy behind ""While You Were Sleeping."" And Betty White is good in anything she does.

4207220,5,B003UMW69I,"I am in no way a big fan of romantic comedies, but I found myself buying this film anyway. I had heard plenty of good things about the film (that I was very skeptic about)and these are two actors who I've got quite a bit of respect for. Most movies don't really get me to laugh. We're lucky if you even get a smirk out of me. Yet I found myself sitting on my living room floor laughing harder than I have in a long time. Now as for why I like this film:

There's something to be said for acting without speaking and Ryan Reynolds has this down. His facial expressions can tell some real stories.

I'm a fan of ""The Office"" and seeing Oscar in this role was a real treat despite how awkward it  was at times. But awkward in a funny/good way.

Betty White is her usual adorable self. I can't think of anyone else to replace her.

Sandra bullock did an interesting job of making an evil boss lovable.

The location was interesting. How many of these movies are set in New York or the Bahamas? Not this one.

No sex scenes. As odd as it is for an 18 year old to say, ""I hate sex scenes,"" I do. I want to watch a movie with my mom and not feel extremely awkward. Plus I find it really annoying when two people who hardly know each other are jumping into bed the first chance they get. I wouldn't really call that ""Romantic"". It just comes off as a cheap way to sell a movie. This movie had NONE of that.

And it isn't extremely predictable. I like to predict endings just from previews and I thought I had this one nailed, but 30 minutes in, I began to wonder if I bet on the right horse.

Now this isn't the kind of movie that's going to win awards for special effects or best musical number, but there's something about the simplicity that makes it all the more enjoyable. It really manages to stand on it's own.

Even my dad, ""Hater of anything not made in the 70's,"" was laughing with us.

4207221,4,B003UMW69I,"I love Sandra Bullock.  My friends all think I'm crazy, but come on; she's adorable, funny and extremely charming.  How can you not love her?  Sure, she may not always have the best taste in film projects, but to tell you the truth, Bullock is one of those rare actresses who can make a horrible film worth my time.  I'd watch her in anything.  Thankfully she didn't have to do much to make `The Proposal' worth my time.  Sure, the film is clich ridden (and practically a slapstick version of her superior 95 offering `While You Were Sleeping') but it is breezy, funny and engaging.

Andrew Paxton is dying to make editor at his Publishing Firm but he's stuck playing second fiddle to Margaret Tate (Bullock in full on Miranda Priestly mode).  When it becomes known that the Canadian Tate is about to be deported she makes a proposal; Paxton agree to marry her so she can stay in the states or she will destroy his career.  Despite the harsh penalties that will come if it is uncovered that this is a hoax, Paxton feels as though he has no choice but to take up her offer.  Paxton and Tate then travel to Alaska for Andrew's grandmother's birthday, and it is there, in the most beautiful place in the world (yes, seriously, I've been there...it is beyond gorgeous) they fall in love.

Yeah, you knew it was going to happen.

Sandra is spot on perfection here, using her infectious charm to liven up her comedic timing.  She has been better before, but she has this down to a science and has no problems getting the audience to connect.  Her chanting in the woods scene alone is worth the price of admission.  I have been hard on Ryan Renyolds before (he is often stiff, one note and ridiculously good looking, which is enough reason to hate him, let alone the fact the he is married to my dream girl) but he steps up his game here and holds his own against Bullock.  Sure, she is better than him, but is sarcastic shtick works very well with his character.

The supporting cast is hit or miss, with Betty White raising the bar and becoming the most memorable part of this film (the Oscar talk his preposterous, but if it happens I'll die in supportive laughter).  Craig T. Nelson is a stereotype, but he's decent.  Oscar Nunez is effectively uncomfortable (that dance scene is just...um...nevermind) and Malin Akerman is utterly ravishing.  I really like Mary Steenburgen from time to time, but this is not one of those times.  She's just kind of meh for me.

In the end I totally propose that you give `The Proposal' a try (I'm not one for puns but I couldn't resist).  It's a really funny and likable film that makes up for a total lack of originality with chemistry and charm.",1256860800,4,2679,4.489669421487603
4207222,4,B003UMW69I,"The Proposal is your typical, high-grossing romantic-comedy with the inevitable, predictable conclusion with an interesting set-up. These kinds of romantic-comedies must be judged differently than the average film. These films are not made to be appreciated, they're made to be enjoyed...Some are too familiar or poorly written to be enjoyed, but what makes The Proposal a winner is the better-than-average writing and the actor's playing the leads.

Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton, the assistant to a stern book-editor named Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock). Margaret is a Canadian and is suddenly faced with deportation; rather than lose her job, Margaret claims to be engaged to Andrew. With a nosy immigration officer breathing down their necks (what they're doing constitutes fraud), Margaret accompanies Andrew to Alaska for the weekend to meet his family.

A cute romantic-comedy setup, although we all know where it's going, but you get Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen as Andrew's parents and the wonderful Betty White as his grandmother.

Discussing the plot or any filmmaking aesthetics such as cinematography is futile, but one thing worth discussing is the performances specifically by the two leads. Reynolds and Bullock play off each other so well; you can just about pinpoint the reason for the film's success. Their sarcastic bickering is not particularly profound, but they have great comedic timing with each other and amusing chemistry as well. Another surprise is that Reynolds is finally starting to hit his stride as an actor, leaving behind the hyper Van Wilder persona that has plagued his previous film roles. Bullock does pull off the stern attitude of her character, but she doesn't have the menacing, realistic quality that Meryl Streep pulled off in The Devil Wears Prada.

The Proposal is a charming, albeit predictable romp that makes for a great date move or just a way to pass the time. The Proposal could have been a terrific romantic-comedy, as it proves by it's first act but once it starts to go the way of the unwritten romantic-comedy handbook it becomes just another amusing way to pass the time. Worth checking out though.

4207233,5,B003UMW69I,"The theme of Anne Fletcher's ""The Proposal"" doesn't break any new ground (another terrific film about a marriage 'of convenience' to stay in America was ""Green Card"", a few years back), but this 'take' has the benefit of two of the most attractive, likable stars around, Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, some genuinely witty dialogue, and the beautiful Boston North Shore (substituting for Sitka, Alaska). The result is a film that will leave you with a smile and a desire to cuddle, so watch it with someone you love!

In a savvy modern gender reversal, Bullock is a brilliant, if ruthless Canadian book editor, and Reynolds is her long-suffering, but efficient secretary, forced into posing as 'engaged' when she is about to be deported. The pair so obviously are mismatched (by age...she is over a decade older...by temperment, and the fact they can't seem to agree on anything about their past), that the 'Elliot Ness' of Immigration (Denis O'Hare, in a funny turn), gives them just three days (spent at his family's home in Sitka, celebrating Granny's 90th birthday), before his interview will send Bullock back to Canada, and Reynolds to prison.

In Sitka, the film really hits it's stride, as we are introduced to the fabulous Betty White (as a very spry nonogenarian) and her cute (and very put-upon) puppy, Craig T. Nelson and (a woefully underused) Mary Steenburgen as his parents, (woefully overused) Oscar Nuez as the local 'jack-of-all-trades', and Malin Akerman as Reynolds' ex-girlfriend. While some situations are expected, under the circumstances (a shared bedroom and accidental nude...VERY nude...encounter, and a 'baby maker' quilt that always seems to be a prop in films involving ethnic cultures), we also get to really know the quiet Reynolds (who is a gifted writer struggling against a father who had already blueprinted his entire life), and the reason for Bullock's attitude (living on her own since a teen, and overachieving to compensate for a lack of love). While the frequent moments of slapstick are hilarious (the poor dog, a hungry eagle, and panic-stricken Bullock's stolen cellphone is a high point), the character development gives the film 'heart', and makes the growing affection between the pair not only believable, but something to cheer about.

In this kind of film, you KNOW everything will turn out all right (what kind of date movie would it be, if it didn't?), but there are a few novel twists to keep things interesting!

Great scenery, hilarious story, good  chemistry and superb support from Steenburgen, Nelson and the incomparable Betty White, who's still stealing every scene she's in at 87.

I'm only adding my 2 cents worth to the pile because I'm a bit stunned that so far no one's mentioned the hilarious comic contributions of Oscar Nunez (the gay accountant on ""The Office"") as Ramone, the local Sitka shopkeeper and caterer who freelances as a male stripper and a wedding officiant, and the great  character actor Denis O'Hare as the immigration official with the gotcha mentality. This movie is worth the price just for the Reynolds and O'Hare reaction shots alone.  But...

For those who don't need a digital copy,  it's not worth the extra 8 bucks just to get the extra extras (a rather mediocre outtakes/goofing off reel, 2 very short deleted scenes and a poorly concocted all-wrong, too-long alternate ending).

Bullock is one of the best book editors in the business, and also a total tyrant. And she's Canadian. Reynolds has been her assistant for three years and suffers all kind of abuse in order to learn from the best and in hopes of getting a promotion to editor. The problem comes in Bullock is facing being deported to Canada. She quickly thinks of a solution and says she and Reynolds are engaged to be married. Now, they have the weekend to learn everything about each other before being quizzed by the supsicious immigraiton agent.

The opening of the movie is great, setting up the character of the tyrant editor and the put upon assistant perfectly. But the movie changes completely when Bullock and Reynolds travel to his home in Alaska for his grandma's birthday. Suddenly, she isn't the tyrant boss anymore, but instead the surprise girlfriend. And Reynolds is now the star. His family is super rich and all everyone is happy to see him. All the romantic comedy plot devices are there, from the quirky relatives, the ex-girlfriend, and the moment of clarity where the characters realize they have to be together.

I enjoyed the movie because of Bullock and Reynolds, but the script and plot did them no favors. The supporting cast of Mary Steenburgen, Craig Nelson and Betty White were at times funny and at times cringe worthy (Betty White).

Give credit to the fortyish actress/producer for not giving in too much to standard ingnue behavior this time. In fact, she plays the alpha dog with Reynolds relegated to the traditional leading lady role.

The storyline has Bullock playing vituperative book editor Margaret Tate, a workaholic careerist who instills fear into her entire office. As her bullied assistant Andrew Paxton, Reynolds caters to her every whim in the hopes that she will help boost his publishing career. As is typical for an opposites-attract rom-com, a complication occurs when Margaret, a Canadian, finds out she is to be deported because her visa application has been denied. Instead of facing immediate termination, she manipulates Andrew to let her superiors know that they are getting married. This moment of desperate deceit leads to an awkward visit with an immigration agent who senses a green-card arrangement and requires proof of their relationship. In order to avert suspicion, Margaret accompanies Andrew to visit his close-knit family in Sitka, Alaska, where it is revealed his family is quite wealthy and in fact, run many of the businesses in town.

They continue their charade of being engaged, which of course, fans the flames of his family's enthusiasm for a wedding. The rest of the film is pretty much what you would expect save a strange episode of Andrew's grandmother performing a native dance in the woods. It's funny to see how Bullock cleverly uses the same prickliness she displayed effectively in her near-cameo in Paul Haggis'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>&nbsp;in this film's establishing scenes as Margaret. In turn, Reynolds shows smart timing as put-upon Andrew, and their interplay has a nice edge. Note how well they perform during the best scenes early on when Margaret baldly lies about their upcoming nuptials at the office and in front of the immigration officer. It's just when they move into more traditional rom-com territory where their chemistry feels weakened and the sparks doused. Chiarelli's haphazard screenplay doesn't help them as they have little beyond one bedtime confessional scene to make us think they may belong together. Craig T. Nelson plays a familiar role as Andrew's disapproving father, but their subplot weighs down the proceedings unnecessarily.

I'm very fond of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, but their coupling in this film did not have the spark I was expecting and hoping for.  The pairing was not believable.  Bullock's character never became likable.  That's not the fault of the actors.  Given a well-crafted vehicle, I think Bullock and Reynolds could be as fun to watch as Rock Hudson and Doris Day were in their classic romantic comedies.

The gem of this film is Betty White, most of the laughs are her gift to the audience.  There was chemistry between Bullock and White -- two talented and accomplished comediennes who seemed to enjoy their screen time together.  Craig Nelson and Mary Steenburgen are fine, given how little they had to work with.  The other standout:  the Samoyed puppy.

Worth watching, sure.  Worth renting?  Maybe, if you are fond of light romantic comedies.  Worth buying?  Not unless you are a very big fan of Bullock, Reynolds or White.",1255824000,2,996,4.742690058479532

If you like a light hearted, feel good movie that is fun than you will also enjoy this movie.

The Blu-ray quality is nice & clean. Not the best picture I've seen but I give it a solid 8/10. I watched it on a Mits HC5000 1080p front projector, Panasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-ray player, on a Da-lite 106"" screen. I also saved $10 with the on-line coupon which makes it an even better deal.

Their bickering, which was I think supposed to be funny, seemed more like real arguing and quickly became tiresome. I would have just turned the movie off, but I wanted to see if they could pull it out of the scrap heap at the end. There was one scene that made me laugh, but the rest of the movie was a wash out.

Ryan's character is her assistant and is forced to marry her or loose his job.  I just wish Ryan was more sarcastic and funny like he's known for.  Sandra plays a good hard arss but not really believable.  All in all I give this movie a three out of five.

(3.) Enter some bureaucratic government worker to create some improbable scenario that sends boss into emergency action to protect her job.
(4.) Which results in boss having to rescue her job by developing a relationship with one of her workers.
(5.) Subservient worker gets back at the boss by having her meet the family. Family has a couple of issues tossed in to add some dynamic tension.
(6.) But overall the family/community is real down-home country with a lot of money (just to show that money doesn't matter).

4207247,3,B003UMW69I,"This movie has a lot of good actors and actresses who do a decent acting job. However, the storyline seems like a collection of typical romantic movie situations cobbled together into something that isn't very meaningful.

The movie is supposed to be about two people who don't get along and have an abusive one-way relationship at work, but who, through a series of events, end up falling in love. My first complaint is that Sandra Bullock is misused in this movie. She is one of my favorite actresses in romantic comedies, but she is always at her best when she's the sweet, innocent-girl type. In this movie she is supposed to be the tough, driven boss everyone hates. She never really effectively gets out of that mode and the so the eventual happy scene at the end seems a little unbelievable. My second complaint is that rather than developing a good storyline that focuses on character and relationship development between the two characters, the movie seems to go for a montage of the typical plot devices for this type of movie. There's the crazy old grandma, the conflict between dad and son over career choices, the discovery that one of the characters was really from a rich family, the scene where the two that supposedly hate each other have a forced kiss that ends up being nice, the scene where the two that hate each other accidentally end up undressed, the scene where the grandma suffers a heart attack and everyone has a change of heart, the scene where the guy realizes too late he loves the girl and goes chasing after her and the list goes on. The problem is that the movie seems to want to pile up all of the ""expected"" scenes for this type of movie rather than focusing on a meaningful story so that in the end, the happy resolution seems like it comes out of left field.

The production quality and acting in the movie are pretty decent, so if you like this kind of romantic comedy this movie is probably worth taking a look at. If you are expecting a top Sandra Bullock movie that will rank up there with While You Were Sleeping or Two Week's Notice, you will probably be disappointed.",1255737600,3,2112,4.5552631578947365

After 30 minutes, I started wondering when the hysterical moments would begin. Unfortunately they never do. Sure, there are a few scenes that are mildly funny but I found most of the film awkward and strained.

4207250,3,B003UMW69I,"I love Sandra Bullock.  I love Betty White.  I love Craig T. Nelson (go Coach!).  Mary Steenburgen was great.  But this movie was totally a recycled storyline from about 3 movies, 2 of which Sandra Bullock starred in.

Margaret (Bullock) is an uptight, high powered, book excecutive who terrorizes her co-workers and subordinates.  Andrew (Reynolds) is the long suffering Assistant that has tolerated her manic ways for three years in hopes of a promotion.  She is a Canadian on an expired Visa and will be deported.  HEY, LETS MARRY MY ASSISTANT and stay in the country.  Andrew agrees on the condition that he gets the promotion he has been working for so hard.  All agreed they head to Alaska to visit his family and try to trick the I.N.S.

After 3 days they connect, she is moved by his family, especially since she has none.  They continue on with the wedding where certain events transpire that SURPRISE proves Margaret loves Andrew.

I wanted to love this film.  I wanted to see Sandra Bullock at her comedic best, again.  But I was left with the impression of seeing this movie before, except in the form of Green Card, Two Weeks Notice, and While You Were Sleeping (one of my all time favorite movies!!!!).

Green Card (self explanatory), Two Weeks Notice (Margaret is the same uptight character that is obsessed with work) and While You Were Sleeping (Margaret is Lucy, an orphan that convinces a family she is the fiance of an injured son she helped rescue. She is moved by a family she wishes she had)l.

There are funny parts, Betty White is great.  But Reynolds (cutie) and Bullock don't seem to have long enough scenes to really progress their relationship.  Right when their banter is getting good and the timing is gelling, it ends.

I wish they could get Bullock some good material, because she is a talented comedic actress and I have missed her in good films.  But this was just not a good pairing.

Two Weeks Notice is a good film and Bullock and Hugh Grant have good chemistry.  While You Were Sleeping is hilarious and has a great cast along with a great script.  Reynolds is funny, but the chemistry between these two is just not there.  The end credits prove this since they are shown solo and it is genuinely funny and they shine, but together its a no go.

Too bad, since the talent was there.  Ramone was the funniest character in the movie!!!!!",1255564800,3,2374,4.60381861575179
4207251,5,B003UMW69I,"Sandra Bullock is a talented actress that is always a pleasure to watch. She can be funny and she can also do good drama. Unfortunately, her film choices have not always been the best. This may not be the case with ""The Proposal,"" a charming and feel-good romantic comedy which showcases Bullock's full range.

Bullock is Margaret Tate, a powerful publishing executive, who is feared by her employees. She is tough and doesn't hesitate to fire people when she doesn't get results. Ryan Reynolds is Andrew Paxton, her assistant, who has been at her service long enough to understand and read her every wish well. The order of things drastically change when, one day, she is informed by her superiors that she will be fired because she is an illegal immigrant - she is Canadian -- working in the United States, which makes her eligible for deportation. Being a smart lady, she thinks fast and immediately tells her bosses that Andrew is her boyfriend, and that they are planning to get married. Andrew, who is taken by surprise, reluctantly accepts. Margaret blackmails him by telling him that he will never be promoted to editor if he doesn't marry her. Andrew, of course, is no fool and also takes advantage of the situation. They will end up in Alaska, visiting Andrew's relatives, because oh his grandmother's birthday. Hell will break loose while there, and many surprises will lie ahead.

""The Proposal"" is very entertaining and well-meaning, aided by a supporting cast that includes Mary Steenburgen, Betty White and Craig T. Nelson, as well as Alaska's beautiful scenery. The DVD includes an alternate ending; commentaries by director Anne Fletcher and writer Peter Chiarelli; alternate takes; and more. (USA, 2009, color, 108 min plus additional materials).

Sandy and Ryan's on-screen chemistry really made this work. Sure the premise and the plot is not new, but it was refreshing to see the story again. I took one star off because of Sandra's character. I feel like it could've been written a little better. There were times where I felt like she went out of character. Not in a very obvious way and I don't want to give details so I don't spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Maybe it was Sandra's acting, maybe it was how it was written.

There is an alternate ending with optional commentary. Fletcher and Chiarelli talk about why they didn't use this ending and another one that they didn't use as well. The humour in this scene is much broader than the rest of the film and seems out of place.

Finally, there is an audio commentary by Fletcher and Chiarelli. They start off explaining the dichotomy between the two main characters.

It has all the right ingredients:  funny, amazing chemistry, beautiful people, hilarious family, perfect plot and did I say funny?  I've almost never been disappointed with Sandra Bullock's movies, whether it be a chick flick or a thriller, but I was soo happy to see Ryan Reynolds getting attention for hitting it out of the ball park - which, I believe, he has been doing for years.  I've been eyeing this actor since the ""Two Guys and a Girl"" days and he is truly the new comic 'it' man.  I can't really think of any old timers to compare him with - but I think he is in the same league as John Krasinski, another fine comedian/actor of this generation.  I think real comedians, the ones that become 'great,' have the ability to be hilarious and also be real and deliver a performance that pulls at your heart - again, Ryan Reynolds hits a home run with this.  Yes, I'm a fan.

The Blu is definitely a mixed bag though. I believe everyone knows of the story by now, and watching these two popular eye-candy actors do their thing keeps the masses entertained as they fall from hate to love of one another.

The Blu clarity has the high budget feel throughout, but in this case to a fault. The green screen coloration is prevalent in any outdoor scene, at times almost appearing deliberately fake (the boat scene after she falls in the water was so apparent you just end up looking past it and focus on the heartfelt moment as was intended). On the second viewing I listened to the writer/director commentary to find out why they shot in Massachusetts instead of Alaska, and as usual it boiled down to money. They did get a few mountain panoramas but the 1080 only gets to show the real ones for a minute or two total. The 5.1 DTS sounds great and gets utilized the best during the strip/bar scene (hilarious sequence). The supplements are bittersweet and include:
* The alternate ending. A way different style of ending that had some hilarious actor(s) completely deleted from the film. It is without the effects so you immediately notice how much green screen was being used - we are talking walls and cranes worth.
* 6 minutes of deleted scenes. Understandable.
* Set Antics as hosted by Aasif Mandvi. 6 minutes worth, you might get a couple chuckles out of it.
* Digital copy of the film on disc 2.
* Commentary by Fletcher and Chiarelli. They get some (sporadic) decent material on there, and by their own admission they admit theirs is how not to do a commentary, but I had to hear all the whys on filming location and volumes of effects for a romcom.
The menu is a corny animated style, but all of the selections have an on/off for commentaries.

I laughed and enjoyed the film, but the solid clarity shows all of the fine line failings throughout as each window background and exterior shot involving mountains becomes glaringly fake at the seams.

Lots of men were in the theatre with me and they were laughing louder than me and my girlfriends.  The acting doesn't get much better than this.  The director has to be pleased with this one because these actors showed up knowing just what to do.  Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds were so good together.  Ryan was great even when he wasn't speaking.  Just his facial expressions were hysterically funny.  He also gave singing a try which was even funnier.  Betty White played his grandmother and was as good as ever.  Sandra and Ryan try hard not to like each other but it just didn't work.  Sandra Bullock looks great.  Girl can't help it, she is just too pretty.  I don't write much about the story because it is described on the Amazon listing and I don't want to spoil anything.  Go watch this movie.

Basically Ryan Reynolds' character is an assistant/slave to Sandra Bullock's character aka his boss from Hell, and he waits for the day when she'll turn to him with a smile instead of a demand and say he's getting his chance as an author, but, before that day will come, he has to do a little illegal pretending to help his beautiful boss out of a bind so she won't end up back in Canada and no longer in a position to make things happen for his career. You can guess from the title what's involved in their scheme. Very funny indeed. Betty White is wonderful. Sandra Bullock's dance around the fire with Betty White was hilarious. All the supporting cast was great. I thoroughly enjoyed the Alaskan setting. Also, there is no other way to say it - Ryan Reynolds is soooo hot, especially in the nude, and Sandra Bullock has done a really good job of keeping her body looking smokin', too. Their accidental naked body slam was well timed and tasteful, so the teens don't need to leave the room for any parents out there. The end theme, of course, if you love someone let them go and they'll come back to you, worked out really well. Romantic movies are my weakness. Oh, one more thing, I loved Sandra Bullock's hair in this movie. She's just gorgeous.",1253664000,,1319,4.495833333333334

In order to avoid being deported back to Canada (and fired by the company) she forces her assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her.

4207279,5,B003UMW69I,"Typically, I dislike ""chick flicks"" ... some are ok, but most are mediocre at best. I was expecting another ""27 Dresses"" or ""Maid of Honor"" but ""The Proposal"" shocked me - it is a nice combination of ""Dan in Real Life"" and ""Miss Congeniality"". The story is well-written and usually pretty-darn funny.

 The plot is relatively straight-forward a high-strung editor realizes that she is about to be deported to Canada. She forces her assistant to lie to immigration and state that they are soon to married. Immigration is more than a little suspicious of the arrangement, so to help convince everyone Ryan Reynolds and Bullock take a trip to Alaska to meet Reynolds family. At this point the movie actually becomes funny (If not perfectly believable). In Alaska we are introduced to a very frank grandmother, the doting ex-girlfriend, and the local stripper/clerk/waiter (played by ""Oscar"" of ""The Office"" fame).

  I guess what I liked about ""The Proposal"" is that Ryan Reynolds plays a very likable character and despite the outlandish plot you get a sense of reality of family interactions.

Things that I liked
  - Great setting - the location may be the star of the movie
  - Funnier than I would have expected
  - Sappy - but not TOO sappy.

But, what's missing here is anything resembling a male with much testosterone.  In addition, the character development and especially the shift in feelings between Bullock and Reynolds is lacking.  For women looking for something to watch on a Saturday night ""The Proposal"" might fit the bill.  On the other hand, this movie brings to bare the lyrics to the ballad ""Where Have All the Cowboys Gone.""  As a guy, my only excuse for watching this movie is that my girlfriend really wanted to see it so I went along with her.  That takes care of the chick flicks for a while.",1253232000,2,711,4.579365079365079
4207281,4,B003UMW69I,"If you have just survived another tough week at the office and are looking for a weekend pick me up, ""The Proposal"" is your sure bet. Yes, I laughed outloud often, and so did most of the audience. The comment frequently heard as the credits rolled was: ""Ooohhh, that was sooo goooood!"".

The story: a tough lady-boss (Bullock) is being deported to Canada for willful non-compliance with the US immigration department. To save herself, she directs her doormat of an assistant (Reynolds) to marry her. He reluctantly agrees to play along, after she ""helps"" him understand the virtues of being employed. If you think you know where this story is going... well, you are right. The ""happily ever after"" cannot be avoided. 'Tis a comedy after all...What is fresh is how skillfully the writers and the director allow the story to veer away from the ""happily ever after"" course, keeping us on the edge of our seats until the satisfying end, which we have known all along was bound to arrive.

The chemistry between the two leads is another pleasant surprise. I am not a particular fan of either Bullock or Reynolds. Though each smoking hot and talented, neither has made many inspired project choices. However, the roles here suit the pair's natural acting styles reasonably well, which in turn further enhances the believability of their characters. The look of constipated doom on Reynold's face, as he's being informed he's engaged, is side-splitting! I do regret Bullock does not play ""mean"" better; the intended juxtaposition of her supposedly tough as nails character against her overly compliant secretary is lost at times. We are TOLD she is a witchy boss, and yet she comes accross nothing more then efficient (Sandra: call me! I'll give you some pointers. In return you can teach me how to find a secretary as hot as Reynolds ;0) ).

Another gem in this comedy is Ms Betty White (of ""The Golden Girls"" fame), an octogenarian in real life as well as playing one in ""The Proposal"". She has made an art of delivering ""campy"" with emotional intelligence. She does not dissapoint here either.

4207289,3,B003UMW69I,"I have three daughters ages 9-14 and I may be a  prude.  I really liked this movie, it's a romantic comedy with quite a sophisticated plot line.  Ryan Reynolds is very convincing as the scion of small town rich folks, who leaves to make his own way in the world.  He returns with Sandra Bullock, his domineering boss, and they announce their engagement.  Its an arrangement, necessary to avoid Bullock being deported, and you know its going to fall apart.  Along the way however Ryan's relationship with his father, with his home-town sweetheart are illustrated, but the easy pitfalls are avoided.  By the end of the film Sandra Bullock's character rediscovers her humanity, the family are reunited with a new respect for each other , and Ryan can return to New York to find out he actually loves Bullock.  I liked the fact that the story line can support the `full-on' New York working life, and not pay undue homage to tradition and down home values.  I thought the supporting cast were good, apart from the grandmother - the lady from Golden Girls - who I thought was given rubbishy dialogue, and idiotic scenes (especially the earth-mother dance in the woods)
 I thought Sandra Bullock was unconvincing as the uber-boss, and some of the office scenes were silly, but overall she and Reynolds were convincing. There were moments of great comedy and tenderness during the movie.  As an adult I thought it was very entertaining.
 But..... In Ireland, however it carries a PG-12 certificate, so my twelve and fourteen year old daughters asked me to bring them to the movie; otherwise I probably wouldn't have gone.  I was very uncomfortable with the scenes where Bullock is brought to a male strip club on the hen party, which I found crude and unnecessary. I was also uncomfortable with Ryan's family's acceptance of the engaged couple sleeping together - the mother and grandmother say something like ` we're not so nave as to think that a young couple ..... "".  In fact, their arrangement  being what it is, the couple don't sleep together.  While the first could have been cut from the movie, the second issue is such a part of the plot that it couldn't.  My objection then is to the certificate.  I'm not sure what age limit I would put on it, I think fifteen would be the lower limit I would choose.  I suppose the film could have triggered a discussion with my daughters about our family values etc, but I was looking for entertainment from the movie, rather than a moral challenge.",1251244800,13,2489,4.693548387096774

Thank God the proposal was funny and it exceded my exceptions. Its about a guy who is a secretary to snippy Boss Lady Margaret.

I laughed so hard I got the hiccups at the drive in. I was not the only one laughing. You could hear people laughing inside their cars.
Mary Steenburgen ,Sandra Bullock and Betty White are all classic comic actors,They have a knack for injecting humour into a simple scene or a line without trying too hard. Ryan Reynolds has eyes like a muppet character. He wiggles them all around ,making funny expressions and is great as the reluctant groom. This script is simple but well written enough to make you care about each character. I was just happy to see Sandra Bullock again she took a little break there for a while.

4207297,2,B003UMW69I,"Redictable is a word I made up while watching this.  It's a combination of ridiculous and predictable.  Allow me to explain before ripping into me.

After considerable kicking and screaming, and putting up a fight similar to a gorilla on PCP being wrestled into a wave pool, the ball-and-chain managed to drag me to the theatre to watch this movie.  I tried to give it a fair chance; I really did.  But then the stupid started.

Man (Ryan Reynolds) works for Woman (Sandra Bullock) for three years.  He hates her.  He loathes her.  She's the Devil's bride, and causes fire hydrants to combust when she flaunts her wealth in poor neighborhoods on Christmas.  Everyone at work despises her, calling her a witch behind her back, and warning one another of her presence via instant messenger.  Guy is essentially an indentured servant (think Daniel in Karate Kid but without learning the karate), and has been Girl's doormat the entire time he's been with the company.  But when Woman gets served her deportation notice, she concocts a plan to marry Man, stay in the country, and keep making tons of money while making everyone else miserable.  Together, the two make their way to a remote Alaskan town to meet Man's family, proclaim their ""love,"" validate her visa (giggity), and blah, blah, blah...yadda, yadda, yadda.

Only the willfully ignorant don't see the rest of this movie coming a mile away.  And THAT'S the problem.  Had there been one deviation from the norm, one step outside of the box, one remotely original idea, this movie would have had a chance with me.  Instead, it's ridiculously predictable, redicatable.

There are only two bright sides to this movie:
1) The beautiful Alaskan countryside (i.e. Bearskin Neck in Rockport, MA)
2) The insight into illegal immigration, and the lengths to which the problem is exposed in the U.S., are scandalously subtle in this film.  While there are countless people at the bottom of the totem pole of illegal immigration (e.g. those packed 20-deep clown-car-style in late 70s station wagons), the security sieve on our borders will not be secure until those with higher status and business involvement are prosecuted and deported to the fullest extent of the law.

4207299,3,B003UMW69I,"Sandra Bullock is a superb actress who knows her audience.  The type of character she plays here - a single woman with a tough if not abusive exterior persona hiding a very vulnerable, lonely interior - is played to perfection.  But then again, this is the type of character she is known-for: her ""brand.""

That said, the producers of this film have chosen to play it safe rather than break new ground.  The basic storyline, themes and characters will be very familiar to Bullock fans.  You've seen them over and over again in other wonderful Bullock films, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/While-You-Were-Sleeping/dp/6304765266/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">While You Were Sleeping</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Congeniality/dp/B00005AAA9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Congeniality</a>.

We do have fun, engaging performances from excellent actors such as Betty White (best known for her work in the TV series ""Golden Girls""); Craig T. Nelson (who was the voice of ""Mr. Incredible"" in the wonderful Pixar film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredibles-Blu-ray/dp/B00198X0WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredibles [Blu-ray</a>]); and Academy Award winner Mary Steenburgen.  Betty White's character, the grandmother of Bullock's love interest ""Andrew"" (played by Ryan Renolds), is hilarious at times: a character who is much more counter-cultural than her octagenarian exterior at first suggests.  - But then again, like Bullock's character, this is a type of role White has often had in both Film and TV in recent years - and she does an excellent job with it here.  Sadly, all of these characters could have used a bit more development in the film: they're well done, but lack depth.

With one exception, there is little in this film to make it stand out from Ms. Bullock's other Romantic Comedies: the use of well known comedic actors in supporting roles, having a well known handsome hunk as the love interest, and so on, are all nothing new for Bullock - nor for Romantic Comedies in general.

That one exception is the nearly nude scene between Bullock and Ryan Reynold's characters.  Other than demonstrating that Bullock has put lots of effort into maintaining a magnificent figure well into her 40's, and using just barely (sic) enough camera blocking limbs and a washcloth.  Seemingly engineered to acheive an ""R"" rating for the film, this particular scene feels very contrived.  It does little to illuminate the audience about the developing relationship between the two main characters.  The time spent here should have been used for a couple of shorter scenes devoted to that purpose.

Finally I was a little disappointed by the film's purported setting in Sitka, Alaska.  I have been to Sitka, and it is a beautiful place: magnificent views of a volcano (Mt. Edgecomb) and a quirky downtown featuring a Russian Orthodox Church (the ""Cathedral of St. Michael"") smack in the middle of the town's main street.  All of this beautiful scenery is missing from the film.  The town in the film looks more like a well established, quaint and quirky New England fishing village than Sitka, which has a bit more of a ""frontier"" and ""wide open spaces"" feel to it - as I think is typical of most seaside towns in Alaska.  So, I sat through the film looking for familiar Alaskan landmarks, only to see in the credits that most of the exterior shots were, in fact, done in my home state of Massachusetts, and in Rhode Island.  --- Which means that you really are seeing a well established, quaint and quirky New England fishing village in the film, rather than Sitka.

Despite all this, I had a smile on my face throughout the film.  Each time I looked over at my beloved's face, she was sporting quite a grin herself.  ""The Proposal"" is for the most part a cute and fun film.  It does a good job with a tried and true formula - just don't expect to see much that is different from what you've seen in previous Bullock films.

I'll rate this film as three stars: entertaining and a good date flick; but one where the producers decided it was best to play it very safe - deliberately avoiding taking the risks that could have turned this average Romantic Comedy into a great one.",1249084800,2,4341,5.291545189504373

4207301,3,B003UMW69I,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed ""The Proposal"", the new rom-com starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.

Andrew Paxton (Reynolds) is the assistant to an editor, Margaret Tate (Bullock) at a large publishing house in New York. Andrew has worked for Margaret for three years, three long, painful, dreadful years working for the ultimate Type-A personality as she works her way up the ladder. He puts up with Margaret because he wants to become a book publisher and he sees the path as her assistant. But this means he has to pick up coffee for her every morning, ordering his coffee exactly as she wants hers, in case something happens to hers. This means if she wants him to cancel a trip home for Gammy's (Betty White) 90th birthday, he will. This means that as soon as he knows she is on her way into the office, he IMs the other staff and the news spreads like wildfire. Margaret, poised to take over as head of the publishing house, is summoned to the boss' office. Her work visa has run into some roadblocks and she has to return to Canada and will lose her job. As she tries to convince her bosses she will take care of it, Andrew enters to tell her about a phone call and she comes up with a plan. She and Andrew will be married, solving everyone's problems. But this is the first Andrew has heard about it and he can barely stand the sight of her. He agrees, but only after she agrees to help him. They decide to go to his family home, in Alaska, to tell his mom (Mary Steenburgen), dad (Craig T. Nelson) and Gammy the news. When they arrive, Margaret learns Andrew's family owns most of the town. Mom and Gammy are surprised, but thrilled to learn of the news and insist they get married there, during their visit. An overworked and suspicious INS Agent (Gilbert O'Hare) watches their every move. Add Ramone (Oscar Nunez), the town's bartender, caterer, shop worker and stripper to the mix and the comedy begins.

Directed by Anne Fletcher and written by Peter Chiarelli, ""The Proposal"" just seems more real and less sitcomy than most of the rom-coms out there. Sure, there are contrivances in the story, to keep everything moving and to get the characters into the right places for the comedy bits, but the characters are more interesting and believable, and a lot of time is spent setting up the environment for the story giving everything a more believable feel.

Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are a nice pairing on screen. Bullock has proven she is a gifted comedienne, able to make us laugh and enjoy her performances. Unfortunately, she has given us some dreadful performances in films that were painful to sit through and watch. In ""Proposal"", she plays a super Type-A personality who is not a nice person. Used to getting her way, she is abrupt and unlikable. She also puts her assistant through hell because she realizes he can use this position as a stepping-stone to a more prominent role within the publishing industry. She holds this over his head, controlling his life, afraid to let him move on in case he is able to leap frog over her.

The first time we meet Margaret, most of the office cowers out of her way, to avoid any contact with her. This is a funny and interesting way of establishing her character. When Andrew spills coffee on his shirt, he bribes another worker into switching with him. This is also an amusing change for Bullock as she usually plays nice and sweet. In ""Proposal"", she plays the flip side of her normal persona, giving her a chance to give Margaret a lot of development and as her character changes, we come to like a woman we initially disliked.

Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew and I am almost to the point where I have to label Reynolds an underappreciated comedic actor. After his funny turn in ""Just Friends"" and his small supporting role in ""Adventureland"", Reynolds has proven that he can do comedy well, making his characters interesting, believable and human. With ""Proposal"", he only serves to solidify this opinion. He seems to be playing Andrew as the straight man, but still manages to elicit some laughs. What this duality does is give the character more depth than you might expect.

Forced into a situation he didn't know anything about, he uses it to his advantage. But then, he realizes how hurt his family will be and has second thoughts, trying to justify everything he is doing. Reynolds does a nice job of portraying Andrew wrestling with this moral dilemma.

It seems like every romantic comedy has to include a certain number of 'wacky' people, to amp up the laughs. In ""Proposal"", Betty White plays Gammy, the matriarch of the family. I was glad to see that White was cast to play a character that is both funny and touching without being particularly bawdy, In many films, older people often seem to provide humor with some ribald remark, or to flirt with a twenty something guy. Look at the old lady. Isn't it funny that she thinks a young man could love her. This type of humor just seems sad and worn out. What this film does have is Ramone, played by Oscar Nunez (TV's ""The Office""). Ramone first appears as a waiter at a party at Andrew's family home. The whole family seems to know Ramone and he flirts with Margaret. As the story progresses, we soon realize Ramone is a man with many jobs who wears many hats. He pops up in increasingly odd circumstances, making us laugh.

Craig T. Nelson plays Joe Paxton, Andrew's dad and the owner of most of the town in Alaska where they live. He wants Andrew to return home and take over the family business, which leads to a lot of animosity between them. Andrew really wants to be an editor and his dad can't understand why all he wants to do is sit around and 'read books'. This storyline is included to give Andrew another human edge (his father is pretty straight laced and wants him to come home) but the character makes a choice, which seems to make him the most cold-hearted person in the world. I honestly don't believe any father who actually loves their son could do the same thing. It robs his character of any empathy and makes him unredeemable.

Mary Steenburgen is good as Andrew's mom. But she seems to be included simply to act as part of a two-person female Greek chorus. She and Gammy go everywhere and seem to do everything together,

""The Proposal"" is cute, romantic, funny and more believable than you might expect. The perfect film to share a warm weekend afternoon with your significant other.",1248825600,,6450,4.586296617519515

I thoroughly enjoyed both Reynolds and Bullock.

The story: A tough female-boss (Sandra Bullock) is being deported to Canada. To avoid losing her lucrative job as executive editor-in-chief of a book publishing company, she blackmails her doormat of an assistant (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her.

Often throughout the roughly two hour time frame, the movie attempted physical humor and large scenes of chaos-I can only assume the writers were trying to conger a 'meet the parents' type feel-for me, these moments felt pushed, awkward, and painful to sit through. Perhaps I disliked this film so much because I had just seen 'the hangover' and 'i love you man'-both of which i loved.

While all the hype of the Transformers movie currently in the movie theatres, there are other films that can feel like you can have a much better time laughing your heart to. That unfortunately hasn't been the case with many films lately. But for Sandra Bullock, it has honestly been awhile since she has made a spectacular film. After a few years, she had focused on her personal life, marry mechanic Jesse James, and settling down back in Texas with a new sense of life. now she is back yet again with her first comedy in several years, and she does deliver a great proposal, a delightful date night movie.

The Proposal, the new Sandra Bullock comedy is actually one of the very few surprise gems that actually is worth enjoying at the movies. The role features Sandra, as Margaret Tate, a busy ego-tistical book editor, whom is more concerned about her job than having a sense of love and happiness. Yet, she faces the role of being deported back to Canada and losing her job. Where she stumbles on the idea of marrying her assistant, which Ryan Reynolds plays. As a result, the two of them flock down to a small town in Alaska to meet what would be her in-laws played by Mary Steenburgen (Ted Danson's Wife) and Craig T. Nelson from Coach, and her editor's assistants grandmother played by Betty White.

Margaret has a bit of trouble trying to adapt to her assistant's family and finds herself in awkward scenario's from trying to rescue a dog from a eagle while being more wsrapped up with her business calls and then losing her cell phone from the eagle's claws, from being uncomfortable with a Native-American traditional dance with Betty White. At the end of it, Margaret decides it would be better to be deported, only to leave her assistant and his family, broken-hearted and thinking it was a mistake. Little did she know as she heads back to New York, to pack up everything, her assistant played by Ryan finds he has real love for his boss and wants to marry her. Yet, only finding themselves go through the legal U.S. immigration process all over again. The film is great, but at times Betty's characters steal the spotlight so well, that there could've been a bit more chemistry you'd want to see with Sandra and Ryan.

Nevertheless, I had a absolutely great time laughing out loud at Sandra Bullock and the movie The Proposal. It honestly has been one of the best movies I've seen from the Summer season in awhile. It really is a great date movie, and something you really will have a fun time laughing out loud to. This honestly is Sandra's best date movie since While You Were Sleeping, and if there is a time you want to look for love, head down to the movie theatres and see The Proposal.

4207309,4,B003UMW69I,"Better than expected romantic comedy.

Sandra Bullock (Rush Hour, Ms. Congeniality, et al.) is the wicked witch of the Ruick book firm, who runs the office with an iron hand.  Ryan Reynolds (X-Men Origins, Just Friends) is Andrew, her assistant.

Sandra plays Margaret, who fires her competition and forces Ryan's character to skip his grandmother's 90th birthday and work on the weekend.

Unfortunately for Margaret, she never handled that minor problem with the US Immigration Office and needs to be deported back to Canada and give up her job.

I know, let's get ""married"" and then a quickie divorce and all is okay.

The silliness ensues.

Yes, this is a romantic comedy with the guy who hates the girl and then who gradually gets to like her.  And there are unusual characters and situations.

What's pleasant about the film is not so much its predictability but the comedic timing and chemistry between Ryan and Sandra.  It's really great.  And no toilet humor, no raunchy stupid jokes that seem to be the current Hollywood standard.

When Margaret gets on the wedding gown and gets the family heirloom from 'grandma', there is a tearful moment and a realization that she's never had a family or friends who have as much love and admiration than Andrew's family (who by the way practically own the whole town in Sitka, Alaska).

Directed by Anne Fletcher, who also produced the Jennifer Lopez hit, The Wedding Planner.

Most of the film takes place in Alaska and there are some great scenes and cinematography, though I understand it was actually filmed in the wilds of the New England states.

Betty White, at 87 and still acting, steals the show with her wit and humor.

A must-see, not your run of the mill average romantic comedy.

4207310,4,B003UMW69I,"I am not a big Ryan Reynolds fan.  Prior to THE PROPOSAL, I  had never seen anything he'd done before that left any kind of impression on me.  My wife was the same way...""have we seen him in anything before?""  Bland (even wooden), usually in dreadful films like WAITING, or in utterly forgettable roles such as in WOLVERINE.

Sandra Bullock is a past-master of the romantic comedy.  She can give ""smart*ss"" and she can do ""sweet"" in the same movie.  She doesn't really create believable people as much as delightful screen personas.  Lately, though, she's clearly been fighting her age...trying to pull off roles that were too ""young"" for her.  I don't know if it's her or her plastic surgery, but she has tended to mostly look vaguely angry...and her makeup is usually VERY harsh these days.

So I was primed not to care very much for THE PROPOSAL.  And as a whole, it is a very predictable, by-the-numbers romantic comedy of the ""they hate each other right up until the last second"" ilk.  But there were just a few scenes that popped with excellent timing, set-up and execution that had me laughing hard...so despite my better inclinations, I'm actually giving this movie a fairly solid recommendation.  For what it attempts and accomplishes.

If you haven't seen the trailer:  Bullock plays a tough-as-nails book editor who has no life beyond work.  She is feared by everyone in the office, because she is ruthless and apparently very good.  She also bullies her assistant (Reynolds), making him work nights & weekends, and forcing him to run all kinds of errands that are certainly beneath his title.  One day, this Canadian finds that she has been ignoring her immigration attorney for too long, and she is about to be deported.  She will lose her position (for a year) to a man she just fired.  Just as she is absorbing this news, in walks Reynolds.  And Bullock hits upon the brilliant idea to announce to her bosses that she and Reynolds are about to be married, thus securing her place in the US.

INS is understandably skeptical, so for reasons that  really don't make a lot of sense, Bullock & Reynolds feel they must immediately fly to Alaska to meet Reynolds' family and old friends.  It's the typical ""fish out of water"" scenario, with Bullock trying to walk in stiletto heels through a tiny Alaskan fishing town.  Or trying to cope with her fear of boats.  Or trying to get along with the family dog when she hates dogs.  NO surprises.  The plot chugs along predictably to an ending that doesn't surprise at all.

Yet, as I said, this film has its wonderful comic moments.  In fact, what may be the best scene comes fairly early.  When Bullock announces her intent to marry Reynolds, he has had no time to prepare.  It hits him by surprise.  And his reaction shots are perfect.  He knows that everyone is in on something, and that he must cover as best he can.  Yet he also has a glimmer of the ridiculous notion Bullock has just tossed on him...that they are in love and engaged.  He's mortified, but wants to be professional.  He wants to deny it, but instinct tells him not to thwart his terrifying boss.  I can't adequately describe it...somehow, Reynolds had a moment  heretofore unachieved by him as a performer.  It's enough to make you like his character from that point on.

Other moments nearly as good pop up from time to time.  When the two  have an unwanted ""nude collision.""  A silly incident with Bullock, the dog, an eagle and a cell phone!

The movie has the required ""serious"" moments too, such as when we discover why Bullock is so uptight and unfriendly.  These scenes only work because the two stars have earned our goodwill in the comedic scenes...otherwise the somber moments would be unbearable.

The supporting cast is mostly window-dressing.  Poor Mary Steenburgen, who is a great actress, is relegated yet again to an unfunny role as ""mother.""  Craig T. Nelson looks like a coach  gone to seed, and isn't very happy about it, as ""father.""  Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN) has a thankless role as a former girlfriend.  Oscar Nunez (TV's ""The Office"") shows up in a crazy role (I won't spoil what it is) that gets some laughs, but in tone, belongs to another film. But the remarkable Betty White is there to shake things up as Reynolds' grandmother.  She's playing a character too over-the-top to be convincing...but she does it with such comic verve that you can't help but like her.  She's 87 years old (doesn't look it at all) and has not lost one moment of her comic timing.  Whoever had the idea to cast her should get 25% of the profits of this film! (On the other end of the spectrum is Denis O'Hare, usually a reliable character actor in both dramas and comedies, who shows up as the suspicious INS agent...and brings a tin ear to his dialogue that makes virtually every utterance supremely unfunny.  He's trying to make a part that doesn't actually have any laughs into something it is not.)

It was amusing that the movie takes place mostly in Alaska.  It was certainly a beautiful location, but you have to think that the driving decision behind that somehow relates to the attention Sarah Palin brought to the state.  Can't you just see a bunch of ""suits"" patting themselves on the back for their timeliness?

In the end, THE PROPOSAL is a predictable romantic comedy.  I enjoyed myself, and I can even envision watching the film again some day on DVD with my daughter and her friends, perhaps.  It doesn't make me put Reynolds on my list of favorites...but he sure scored a lot of points with me.  Bullock gets a reprieve.  Betty White gets an MVP award.  And I got to laugh a lot more than I would have expected.  I think for the clich&eacute; heavy genre that it's in...I must actually give the film 4 stars!!",1245801600,,5758,4.631058358061326

Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have a slight implausibility issue as a couple but they make the most of the clever script and as you knew it would, it all turns out happy in the end.

Bullock plays Margaret Tate, a harpy of a boss in a New York publishing firm. Reynolds is Andrew Paxton, her baby-boy secretary, a young man with brains and aspirations who puts up with her controlling ways for the sake of his career and his writing prospects. Margaret is Canadian and has been ignoring routine Immigration Service requirements; suddenly she is about to be deported and she announces in front of a stunned Andrew that they are going to be married. Andrew finds his backbone and sets conditions--the first being a trip to his home in Alaska for his grannie's 90th birthday party.

Mary Steenburgen and Craig T Nelson play Andrew's parents. Along with the irrepressible Betty White (playing ""Gammie""), they decide that a wedding the very next day would be just the thing. And perhaps it would be, but for the Elliott Ness-style immigration agent turning up at the family compound. And of course all the family love makes hard-bitten Margaret re-think the deal.

Oh, you can guess how the gags go, but that doesn't make it any less fun. Margaret is lost without phone and computer. There are boats and scenery, and the Alaskan midnight sun, and the family popping in and out of the bedroom while Andrew is trying to sleep on the floor. Betty White puts on a cape to dance and chant in front of a fire, luring Margaret to join her for a spontaneous sexy rap. In a killingly funny scene, ""the girls"" take Margaret out to see a local stripper named Ramone (Oscar Nunez) who later turns out to be a shop owner and marriage celebrant. Altogether a funny, heartwarming romp.

Bullock and Ryan have great timing and delivery; the supporting cast is stellar; and the scenery pleases without being obtrusive. As an example of its genre,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Proposal-Theatrical-Release/dp/B001PR0Y5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Proposal [Theatrical Release</a>] convinced me that it deserves five stars. Go on, you'll come out of the theater smiling and isn't that worth five stars?

PG 13, a little bit of nudity and some language.

4207313,5,B003UMW69I,In the days before home video people would often remark that a film was 'must-see' now the catch phrase is 'must-own' and that's what this one is.  Just saw it in the theater and haven't laughed so much in a long time.  This is a 'must own' film because you will want to rewatch it and show it to company.  In hindsight I was glad the snack bar was too crowded to get a soda because I'd have surely passed it through my nose - and those bubbles are painful.,1245628800,,457,4.055555555555555
4207314,3,B003UMW69I,"The ball and chain wanted to see this movie so I broke down this morning and we went to the matinee.  I expected to hate this romantic comedy as much as the critics.  It is definately a formula flick but I didn't hate it.  Nothing in the screen play makes much sense, the time line for all of the events to take place is absurd, and the chemistry between Reynolds and Bullock isn't there.  When the ex-girlfriend entered the story I was hoping for more tension and maybe even a bit of character development.  No such luck, the ex-girlfrind is a pointless character.  The producers chose instead to fill the time with a rediculous discount male stripper scene. The movie is too long (are there any editors in Hollywood anymore?)  There are many more problems but I don't feel like wasting anymore words.  Strange as it may seem, I did feel entertained in the end.  I laughed a few times along with my lady and we did have a good time.  It is a very lightweight, farcical chick-flick that I felt was worth the $10 I paid for the two of us...but not much more.",1245542400,,1057,4.374358974358974
4207315,5,B003UMW69I,"Don't read the reviews.  Just go see it.  I got home over an hour ago and am still smiling!!!  This movie makes you laugh and warms your heart at the same time.  Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have great chemistry and talent to spare.  Sure, it has a predictable ending, but I enjoyed watching every minute getting to it!!",1245542400,,324,4.423728813559322
4207316,5,B003UMW69I,I really enjoyed this movie. You will forget your troubles and worries the entire time you are watching the movie. I will see this movie again and will be buying the DVD. Is this movie available in book format?? I loved the movie so much that I am looking for the book version. Does anyone know where I could find it???,1245369600,,319,4.245901639344262
4207317,4,B003UMW69I,"If you have just survived another tough week at the office and are looking for a weekend pick me up, but have already seen ""The Hangover"", ""The Proposal"" is your next best thing. Yes, I laughed outloud often, and so did most of the audience. The comment frequently heard as the credits rolled was: ""Ooohhh, that was sooo goooood!"".

The story: a tough lady-boss (Bullock) is being deported to Canada for willful non-compliance with the US immigration department. To save herself, she directs  her doormat of an assistant (Reynolds) to marry her. He reluctantly agrees to play along, after she ""helps"" him understand the virtues of being employed. If you think you know where this story is going... well, you are right. The ""happily ever after"" cannot be avoided. 'Tis a comedy after all...What is fresh is how skillfully the writers and the director allow the story to veer away from the ""happily ever after"" course, keeping us on the edge of our seats until the satisfying end, which we have known all along was bound to arrive.

The chemistry between the two leads is another pleasant surprise. I am not a particular fan of either Bullock or Reynolds. Though each smoking hot and talented, neither has made many inspired project choices. However, the roles here suit the pair's natural acting styles reasonably well, which in turn further enhances the believability of their characters. The look of constipated doom on Reynold's face, as he's being informed he's engaged, is side-splitting! I do regret Bullock does not play ""mean"" better; the intended juxtaposition of her supposedly tough as nails character against her overly compliant secretary is lost at times. We are TOLD she is a witchy boss, and yet she comes accross nothing more then efficient (Sandra: call me! I'll give you some pointers. In return you can teach me how to find a secretary as hot as Reynolds ;0) ).

Another gem in this comedy is Ms Betty White (of ""The Golden Girls""), an octogenarian in real life as well as playing one in ""The Proposal"". She has made an art of delivering ""campy"" with emotional intelligence. She does not dissapoint here either.

Final verdict? Will this film change the course of modern cinematography?

Not a fat chance!

Did it chase my blah's away until Monday morning?
