2638386,3,B000HIVIXI,"This is a sad story of how boredom and too much luxury can lead to unfortunate circumstances. Also a good example of being in the wrong place at the right time can have bad repercussions. Storyline is slow and padantic, but the eye candy is nice. However, its just not enough to roll this into a 5-star movie experience.",1256601600,3,320,4.440677966101695
2638387,5,B000HIVIXI,"The plot is rather non-existant, but I give it 5 STARS: 3 STARS for the eye candy and 2 STARS to counteract ""Gordon Larko's"" generic, homophobic 1 STAR review. At least this time his review is ALMOST warranted, but still unwanted since he never even saw this movie.
For some reason, he feels compelled to leave the EXACT SAME horrible review and 1 STAR rating for all GAY-THEMED movies. Probably a ""personal problem"" of his. Hopefully this review will help correct this imbalance. I can't believe AMAZON is allowing this GAY BASHER to use their website as a venue to spread his hate.",1235952000,2,583,4.669902912621359
2638388,3,B000HIVIXI,I was expecting more gay sex between the guys in the film. This film is about guys traveling through Brazil. Not my kind of DVD. For the women this may be something you will like.,1226880000,,179,4.142857142857143
2638389,1,B000HIVIXI,"I think if I brought a couple of the cuties home from the bar, pulled out my camcorder, went on an exotic vacation, and used my Pinnacle editing program, I could have made a better movie.  Cute guys, the rest was a mess.",1185494400,11,220,4.116279069767442
2638390,1,B000HIVIXI,"This film basically sucks! There is one incredible looking young German guy (Erik) that is awesome to watch and he's the only reason I stayed with this thing through to the end. Amazon's editorial review was extremely misleading. It would imply that ""Saved by the Bell's"" A.C. and Zach were in this film and locking lips and loins on the white beaches of Brazil. If that took place even remotely in this film, I totally missed it. The cast is made up of three German guys, one of which as I already stated is BEAUTIFUL, and the acting appeared to be fair, if you could understand what was supposed to be happening. The actors done good with the very poor script they were given to work with, especially the lead actor who accidentally murders a man in self defence. The potential was definitely there throughout this thing, but it didn't even attempt to live up to that potential.

The music sucked bigtime! The subtitles were difficult to understand, and there needed to be subtitles for the very poor English parts of the film that the viewer is expected to understand. A very hard film to follow, and where it leads is not a place you will enjoy going. Right when it appears there is finally going to be a plot, the movie ends suddenly with a ""no ending"" end. Beautiful Brazilian landscape and hot young actors are about all this film has going for it. I have no idea who was longing for something or what they were longing for. Thus the name ""The Longing"" was ill conceived at best. I do not recommend this one, unless you simply want to see some nice footage of a very gorgeous young blonde German boy that is super hot. If only they would show more than 3 seconds of him nude, it might make this film worth the buy.",1185062400,10,1721,4.429022082018927
2638391,1,B000HIVIXI,"IF I COULD GIVE THIS FILM NO STARS I WOULD. THERE IS NO ""ACTING"" GOING ON HERE. NO PLOT. NOTHING. ALL I GOT OUT OF THIS MOVIE WAS SWINDLED FOR WHAT I PAID TO BUY IT. DON'T DO THE SAME!!!!!",1183939200,5,188,3.725
2638392,2,B000HIVIXI,"This was not a good film.  The premise is less interesting than it sounds and the thin strands of story aren't plausible or that interesting.  While the acting was ok (not great) and there were some attractive men on screen, it just wasn't a good enough storyline to be interesting.  The central event that provides the conflict for the plot is somewhat confusing and the connection of the two lovers not believable.

I think this studio can do better.",1177632000,11,452,4.6835443037974684
2638393,1,B000HIVIXI,"The cover art for this flick is fantastic.  It is the highlight of the film.

There is a nothing story about three guys into Internet porn, making music, eating, and hanging around looking beautiful in Speedos.  There is a murder subplot, which is laughably filmed, like the rest of the movie.  All of it is poorly done, poorly pieced together, and totally unsatisfying.

It might be worth a rental to check it out.  I would suggest you keep your finger on the fast forward button.  No need to read the subtitles; the dialog barely matters.  Generally, I'd recommend investing my time in something else.",1175731200,24,603,4.730769230769231
2638394,3,B000HIVIXI,"'Saudade - Sehnsucht' (THE LONGING) is a film by writer/director J&uuml;rgen Br&uuml;ning who seems to have taken a vacation from Germany to Brazil with some friends and decided to make a movie as a means of entertainment.  This film is less about characters and story development than it is about Brazilian beaches, snorkeling, fish butchering, second-rate pop music, and food.

Ostensibly we find three friends who've had a rock band in Germany on vacation in Brazil: Cyrus (Tarik Qazi) is interested in finding his Brazilian mother; Tim (Daniel B&auml;tscher) remains determined to explore a new music sound; Erik (eye candy hunk Hendrik Scheider) wants to find love.  The three finance their excursion by making daily film clips of body contact to use on the internet dating business.  Their housekeepers Maria (Maria Lucia da Silva Ludwig) and Angela (Marilza da Cruz Pinto Gregio) feed their interests as well as their appetites.  Most of their time is spent in clubs and at the beaches, pursuing little but opportunism.  Erik has a tryst on the sand with a Brazilian man one night that ends in a death that sours his desire.  When another attractive Brazilian lad Miguel (Aldri Anunciao) catches Erik's eye the two begin a struggle for a relationship, but Erik's previous encounter colors his ability to find happiness.

The actors are all attractive and given the fact that they have little to do but look alluring manage to make the film tolerable.  But in the end the movie feels too self indulgent to satisfy any audience member.  It is a piece of fluff disguised as a soap opera.  Grady Harp, January 07",1168041600,12,1615,4.922509225092251

8139945,2,B000HIVIXI,"This video-movie stars a trio of actors in lead roles who had appeared together in ""West ficht Ost"", a movie which, loosely, is also thematically related, at least in part, to aspects of sex commerce. ""The Longing"" (""Saudadade"", also titled ""Sehnsucht"") eeems to have higher aspirations than much of any real achievement. ""The Longing"" depicts the three sexy friends from Germany together now in Brazil, operating a sort of Webcam venture.

As if to justify the relative crudity of its cinematography (if one dare even to use such a word in its regard), it is claimed that this movie takes as its prototype the Brazilian variant of the ""soap opera"" genre. Well, it looks limited even by that standard. The scenery is great. If one play this back at a 4:3 screen image, the some of the men are fairly appealing in a moderately beefy sort of way; seen with a full screen setting the muscular ones merely look bloated. However, perversely enough, one has to watch the ""making of"" special feature (way too long to sustain interest) at full screen setting or the boys look like scarecrows.

The story line is rather like a mediocre Italian ""verismo"" opera libretto gone gay. ""Boy kills guy. Boy meets the guy's brother. The two fall in love. Brother finds out from boy's tearful confession that Boy killed brother. The dudes cannot reconcile."" At least there is no second killing. There is, along the way, much ""p.c."" jabber about racial oppression, especially of black gays in Brazil. Pretty limited stuff. withal The mostly German cast of actors (one of them actually Swiss) in their roles as white tourists or expatriots, at least mostly, are amateurs and that shows. The black cast members fare only a little better in their roles as indigenously Brazilian.

Getting from the quality of their acting to the more encouraging question of sheer good looks, those tourists from Germany seen in the film fare better. The classiest-looking guy in the cast, for these eyes, is not muscle-bound Hendrik Scheider as Eric, but rather well-built but trimmer Tarik Qazi as Cyrus. Nonetheless, Scheider is the one who figures in the full-frontally nude scenes. In the one in which Schneider appears totally nude to delight the viewers' eyes, Scheider is totally buck-naked in a prone position, but his bulky musculature only succeeds in making him look like a beached, very pink walrus. That is not exactly flattering for a dude whose manly assets and rugged physique could be filmed a lot better nude than that in a scene of more skillfully, better camera lens-framed-and-composed shots of him.

Well, the film itself and its DVD are not quite for the trash bin. The video product is to keep for viewing maybe once or twice more. Then it goes, delayed, into the trash or to some thrift shop!",1503792000,,2778,4.842105263157895

8139953,1,B000HIVIXI,"Three Gay, German guys are living in Brazil. One has a rich father. One is a failed rapper. One is a failed investment banker. None of them can act. The failed banker falls in love with a black soap opera actor, after accidentally killing his brother. Naturally they break up after the murder is confessed. Wow, what a plot twist.

A major scene consists of a Black Brazilian who is ranting about how badly blacks are regarded in Brazil, and that Gay Black Brazilians are treated even worse. The reason for the rant is unclear, and the whole scene seems to be more of a showcase for two twitchy drag queens who don't seem to be interested in anything but getting to the bar and doing their show.

There's no beginning to the story. There's no complicated plot. There's no sex (Just one brief nude scene). There's no action. There's not a clear conclusion to the story. The filming was done in a gorgeous location that could have been the highlight of the film, if it had been shown, but it wasn't. The best part of the whole thing is the 'special feature' about the making of the film, where everyone complains about the location, makes excuses for the lousy acting, and admits the film is poorly cast and badly written.

The director says he didn't want to make an intellectual movie. I think he succeeded in that. The film stinks as bad as the actors say Brazil stinks. The actors stink worse.",1263081600,5,1395,4.5059288537549405
