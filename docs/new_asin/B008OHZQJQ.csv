8529325,5,B008OHZQJQ,"Unique documentary about trailblazing ""avant garde punk rock jazz folk noise free improvisation vaudeville musical comedy"" etc etc, collective Rock In Opposition. Founded in the late seventies and still vital after all these years. The music of these bands has not aged. It's still able to command attention, excitement and admiration, and just sounds new with every listen. The name of the bands are familiar to the initiated, but just in case: Etron Fou Leloublan, Henry Cow, Univers Zero, Von Zamla, Stormy six, Art Zoyd. Not to mention their ""musical offspring"" like Skeleton Crew, Massacre, Present, The Muffins etc etc. Many lump this music within the progressive rock barrel, but that term is a misnomer as far as I'm concerned. RIO and kin are esthetically operating in a different realm from (admirable and great) bands like King Crimson, Yes or Gentle Giant. Unfortunately the ""great masses"" have yet to discover their existence. The documentary shows interesting concert footage interspersed with talking heads expounding the history and virtues of the RIO collective.",1502496000,,1079,5.315789473684211

8529327,5,B008OHZQJQ,"This documentary examines a small but vibrant sub-genre of Progressive Rock called ""Rock in Opposition.""  It began with Henry Cow in the 1970s and -- true to its non-commercial nature -- dissolved almost immediately after forming.

However the term RIO lives on, in dozens of bands from all over the world who play ""difficult"" music in opposition to what everyone says about the business of marketing music.  RIO has attracted a rabid following among fans like me who like the spiky rhythms and unpredictable melodies.  Every year more and more consumers defect from the beige safety of 'corporate music' and discover the technicolor world of musicians who play music for the sheer joy of playing and composing -- not to get rich.

This film interviews many of RIO's founders, and places the music in the context of the times.  Newer musicians are interviewed and shown performing their music which descends directly from the example of that first wave.  The scene is more active and alive now than ever, and this documentary can't help but expand RIO's influence.

Will it take over the world?  Probably not.  But it is an inspiring documentary which awakens the love of music and makes you realize how much fun music is supposed to be.",1402012800,,1237,4.875598086124402
