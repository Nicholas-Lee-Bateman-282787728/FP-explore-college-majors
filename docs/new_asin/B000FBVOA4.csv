2559989,5,B000FBVOA4,"If you're looking for a first-hand experience into the sport before flying, or perhaps you're an instructor looking to share a video with your students, this video is the best. Period. It has footage and information about the history of hang gliding, the steps an average student takes to becoming a pilot, and even an inside look at the fellow pilots, characters, and lingo you'll come to know once you get in the air. It's got a little bit of everything in the mix.

I'm a big fan of ""American Dreamin"", a home-made mass-produced DVD easily found around the Bay Area featuring ""first-person"" footage from popular pilots around California. But as exciting as that video compilation is, it's very unfamiliar to newbies of the sport.

""The Flyingest Flying"" is a great DVD that anyone can appreciate. This movie is definitely worth the price. With amazon.com, it shipped quickly and arrived at my door by the end of the week. 5 Stars.",1249516800,4,933,4.788819875776397
2559990,5,B000FBVOA4,"This film shows the most complete history of hang gliding overall that I have seen in the 30+ years of flying.  It also shows the more modern versions of flying them with towing and all.  Seems just a little heavy on the disappointment of the female pilot and her injuries... but it happened and it's the author's point of view.  Still rate it 5 stars for overall excellent.

8120480,5,B000FBVOA4,"I enjoyed the history about the development of modern Ultra-light flying.  The visuals alone are worth watching, they almost make you want to run out and start taking lessons!  It was interesting following the progress of the students as they trained.",1477526400,,251,5.097560975609756
8120481,1,B000FBVOA4,"I'm a big aviation fan and pilot.  This film (yes, it shows like an old film) might be good, but I never made it past about 7 minutes in because I couldn't get past the old looking SD square format and the narration sounding like it was from the 80's.  Wait.... WAS this from the 80's?  I can't remember.  Anyway, not interesting enough to me to keep watching.",1476921600,,360,4.25
8120482,3,B000FBVOA4,There was a little interesting history. I was not as interested in the personal stuff which was the majority of the program.,1476316800,,124,4.681818181818182
8120483,3,B000FBVOA4,"The video was pretty informative on the historical development of hang gliding, and provided some additional insight into training methods. There was not a lot of excitement in the feel of the video, which I think a film about hang gliding could/should definitely have. Also, production quality was a little underwhelming.",1464220800,,322,5.333333333333333
8120484,5,B000FBVOA4,"The best and most informative hang gliding dvd I've seen yet. It covers the interesting history behind modern aeronautics and hang gliding as well as the basics for the beginner hang gliding enthusiast from sand dune launches to cable pulls with excellent video footage and personal stories. Most other hang gliding dvds I've purchased were more like promos to get you interested, but this one gets straight to the point. Very uplifting, if you'll excuse the pun!",1459641600,,463,5.025974025974026
8120485,5,B000FBVOA4,"I never knew that there was so much to hangliding. This gives you history in a non boring way. You meet instructors learn techniques,slangs and some very interesting facts about how it all works. If you know someone who Hanglides check this out. If YOU want to get a feel for it,this is a must see video. I wouldn't try Hangliding without having watched this.",1391472000,2,359,4.538461538461538
