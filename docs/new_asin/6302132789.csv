426929,5,6302132789,"Glad to see this somewhat underappreciated, overlooked and forgotten masterpiece is finally on DVD. Maybe now more people will discover its brilliance. Don't really have much to add to the existing reviews except two things:

I almost feel that Hopper's lucky he was a long established actor and this wasn't his debut because Paris Trout is such a loathsome character, and Hopper was so effective in the role, that it could have been one of those cases where the disgust for the character bled over to the actor. He was that good.

Also, I seem to remember there was some controversy over this film because, like Linda Fiorentino in ""The Last Seduction"", many wanted to give the film, and Hopper, Oscar nominations but Academy rules forbid it because, even though it did have a limited theatrical release, it was produced by and originally aired on cable (Showtime I think). Too bad because I have to wonder if Hopper would have won if he had of received a nomination for best actor. I have no doubt he would have at least received a nomination.

GREAT movie and a must see for anyone who loves great acting and writing!!",1197331200,9,1121,4.680203045685279
426930,5,6302132789,"This Dennis Hopper film has not received the attention it deserves. Classic performance by Hopper at his most menacing. Barbara Hershey and Ed Harris are also excellent in this powerful drama! If you are a Hopper fan, you'll definitely enjoy his character portrayal.",1184803200,8,266,5.209302325581396
426931,4,6302132789,"I must first state that I'm an avid fan of Dennis Hopper. Which probably explains my love of this film-it's a reprisal of my favorite Hopper-the menacing, frightfully sinister one-much like his role in ""Blue Velvet"" (the only saving grace in that film, IMO). If you're not a big fan of his, then I, quite honestly, don't recommend ""Paris Trout."" Others might find it or ""too depressing"" or even ""unsettling"". I tend to enjoy movies that that masses either find too offbeat or not uplifting enough. This is a movie about a man who doesn't adhere to societal mores in the deep south and how that affects those who are unfortunate enough to cross his path. If you're looking for a happy ending, then look elsewhere, because you won't find it here.",1180915200,8,744,4.643939393939394
426932,5,6302132789,"First at all: you may argue the racism in movies have reached the saturation point, and may be you decide to pass down this offer. But let me tell you that this criterion may shadow the possibility to watch one of the most potent and admirable performances in years of an enviable cast.

Consider the Dennis Hopper's performance. I think Dennis has made through his career, six outstanding portraits: Hoosiers,The American friend,Blue Velvet, Black widow, True Romance and this one. Second argument Ed Harris as the implacable investigator is superb too. Third: Barbara Hershey makes a penetrating and brilliant acting as the sensitive wife of Hopper.

Finally,the script by itself: we have a crude and terrible drama in the forties: Hopper plays a role of a convinced racist (and facist too, if you want)who considers the brutal murder means less tha nothing. His out of mind actions are so enrooted in the most stinking beliefs and prejuices.

The sequence of the crime is plenty of high caliber realism and dramatic intensity that makes us to remind Parker's Mississippi burning, but the best is yet to come when the fury, rage and sick obsession becomes gradually in a true state mind, deeply neurotic and obsesive. His familiar relationship is just sinking; his progresive process isolation is told with superb handle camera.

I recommend this work due its undeniable virtues. Tension, hard to follow story due the merciless argument but plenty of good sequences.",1122336000,3,1468,5.053719008264463
426933,2,6302132789,"In case you missed the last 100 movies out of Hollywood on racism in the south---here's another one. Although it does remind us of the sickness history has taught us about,especially around the period the movie is set in(circa 1949),it is too shocking brutal and unforgiving to offer any hope,let along enjoyment. Dennis Hopper's performance is fantastic! He is sadistic and paranoid and eventually pathetic. Hersey and Harris are excellent as they almost always are. The problem lies with the pattness of the movie. It's the familiar plot taken a little(or a lot)further for the shock value. I don't think I like this director and the screenplay might have been done by one of those slasher/gore types. The two stars are for the performances and that's about it.",1018742400,3,763,4.96875
426934,5,6302132789,"Produced in 1991, and based on the novel by Peter Dexter, this film which was produced for theaters but wound up on HBO, stars Dennis Hopper as a sadistic Southern bigot in the late 1940s.  Not only does he cruelly abuse his wife in a most humiliating way, he goes to the home of a poor black family to collect a debt and viciously shoots a woman several times and murders her 12-year old daughter.  His lawyer, played by Ed Harris, defends him at his trial but gradually becomes disgusted with his client and befriends and then romances Hopper's wife, played by Barbara Hershey.  Only tragedy can result from this; it is just a matter of how and when.
All performances are excellent, especially that of Hopper, who again plays the perfect villain.  He's deranged and sinister, far beyond even the tolerated racism of the time, and his cruelty knows no bounds.  His performance sent chills down my spine, as I stayed glued to the small screen holding my breath as the story unfolded.  Darnita Henry played the role of the young girl with a combination of terror and innocence that endeared her to my heart.  I identified with her and mourned her death with a sense of revulsion at the casual way in which Dennis Hopper perceives it.  Tina Lifford, the young girl's mother who survives the attack, gives a fine performance as she testifies in court with a quiet dignity.  The audience knows the truth and then sees the horror of the twisted justice meted out at that time.  This film is sad, without a shred of humor or hope.  It is not a pleasant experience and left me upset and troubled.  But yet I recommend it to those not afraid of the emotional catharsis.  Just be forewarned.",1003363200,6,1682,4.566666666666666
426935,1,6302132789,"I partially blame Stephen Gyllenhaal for ending Debra Winger's film career. He mis-directed her in A Dangerous Woman, and after Billy Crystal  tied a pigeon to her head in Forget Paris, she didn't have a chance.  (Jessica Lange was great enough to survive her encounter with Gyllenhaal in  Losing Isaiah). Perhaps he is only capable of supporting lesser actors like  Barbara Hershey, who he has used a number of times. (Their Killing in a  Small Town for TV is probably their best collaboration). Here Hershey is  the narrator of the story of the trial of her husband Dennis Hopper for  shooting a little black girl. Hopper's character is so mean that he can  wear a buttoned-up stiff white-collared shirt in the humid South. His  appearance recalls Robert Mitchum's homicidal preacher from Night of the  Hunter, and his haircut screams psychotic. Since we are presented with the  truth of the killing at the start, and because we are in the South and the  victim is black, we know that the verdict is inconsequential. The all white  jury tips you off too. Gyllenhaal even gives the courtroom audience  hand-held fans which flap like insect wings and upstage the trial scenes.  He seems more interested in the sado-masochistic relationship between  husband and wife. Granted these scenes give some life to the otherwise  sluggish pacing, and they also feature an odd fetish for glass. Glass is  broken, a bottle is used to rape Hershey, and Hopper covers his bedroom  floor with panes to ensure his wife does not enter. This kind of detail  also carries over to Hopper's invalided mother, whom he watches being  bathed in the opening scene, but who's condition is never given any payoff.  The only thing remarkeable about the whole film is the formal dialogue, and  the fact that people in the South tend to resist being shot. Hopper might  have triumphed in his role with a better director. It seems as if he is  ready to rage but hasn't been given the opportunity, since Gyllenhaal cuts  away from him. Ed Harris initially brings some tenderness to his role as  Hopper's lawyer, but the brutality of his sex with Hershey only reminds us  of her bottle encounter. We are told that the oldest lesson of the South  is: it is easier to bury than forget. Since this film was intended as a  feature but then shown on TV, it seems the opposite is true for Gyllenhaal.",966816000,5,2362,4.746305418719212

7821474,4,6302132789,"Dennis Hopper, Barbara Hershey and Ed Harris: now there's three last names- all beginning with H- and all in their prime in the 1980s.  Here's a bigger oddity: nary a profane word spoken by either Hopper or Harris in this movie!

There also is very little violence. However, when it occurs, it is shocking. Hopper plays his normal evil person and is convincing, as always. The film is fascinating for the first half but then bogs down with the romance between Hershey and Harris. It picks up again at the end.

The scenery here of the rural South of the 1940s is very pretty. This is an odd film; almost hard to classify, but certainly worth a look. It's not a well-known film, as you can see by the amount of reviews.  I've seen it twice and enjoyed it both times.",1238716800,2,765,4.404255319148936

7821476,2,6302132789,"Well I'am not too surprised this movie doesn't get too attention. I wouldn't it call a masterpiece but neither a terrible movie. It falls somewhere in the middle.

Plot (Spoilers to follow): An altercation between a racist white man and a black boy about the ownership of a damaged vehicle prompts the white man to kill the boy's mother and sister.

Pros:

Dennis Hopper's character as Paris Trout is probably the most fleshed out character in the movie. The movie main selling point basically is this bigot's journey into madness and self-destruction and to that Dennis Hopper does it like the veteran he is.

Cons:

*Predictable ending
*The other characters are one dimensional and weak
*The ending itself leaves you a bit unsatisfied.

Barbara Hershey is a great actress but her character is so one dimensional it's almost annoying. Hanna Trout represents back then and even today the battered housewife, the housewife whose come to expect nothing from life except the misery of her husband.

Ed Harris's character as Harry Seagraves is pretty much despite his handsome, heroic appearences not much better than Paris Trout. Here's a lawyer defending a murderer who he knows is guilty, has sex with his wife and well there's pretty much it.

The story takes place in Georgia and well while I can go along with the fact that the law has in certain situations been corrupt, why is it that no one else confronts Paris? Certainly the character is so hateful and pitiful that I was awaiting for the moment when somebody takes revenge on him but it never happens. I realize Stephen Gyllenhaal's goal was to show an evil man getting away with murder but he could have made things more interesting which leads to my next point: This movie is way too long.

This movie could have been cut down immensely like the court scenes which  serves no purpose especially when we learn how Paris gets away with murder.

All in all it's an ok film, some might like others not. It's probably not the type of film you would watch again as there are other films like it. However, if you are a Dennis Hopper fan you'll probably like it.",1217808000,2,2114,4.70189701897019
