4285682,2,B00480PTV8,"I enjoy the Around the town videos on there YouTube page. But this was not that great! A few parts were good but that was it. And I thought the whole fake prank stuff was so lame, trying to be like Jackass and failing big time.

They could have talked about making those B-Movies or perhaps talk about funny things about their family or friends. Basically give it some heart and soul to it. And maybe adding titles, credits, music, etc. Seems like the only thing they put effort in to was the cover art.

So glad I only rented it. Couldn't imagine paying full price for it.",1290470400,3,573,4.296296296296297
4285683,2,B00480PTV8,"I would only recommend picking this up if you are a die hard fan of there's.  Personally, I wasn't impressed.  Yes, it had a couple funny moments but besides that it was pretty boring. Also the re-watchability is very low.  I watched it once and that was enough for me.  Maybe in a year or two I will give it another watch but no time soon.  So if you big fans of there's and want to support what they do, I guess pick it up and make your own judgement on it but otherwise I would recommend staying away.  It's not really any different than there around the town videos (which you can watch anytime on youtube) besides the fact that they go across the country.  Also I picked this up for $7.99, I have noticed the price changes quite a bit.  Anyways I would give it 2.5 stars if possible.",1290038400,,788,4.172185430463577
4285684,5,B00480PTV8,"I'm not going to lie, but the main reason I initially bought this DVD was for the cover art. I thought the illustration was excellent and really enjoyed the humor in it. I've heard really great things about the movies from these guys and decided it was worth it to buy the DVD. I have to say I'm glad I got it and these guys are in for a successful run!",1289952000,3,353,3.9859154929577465
4285685,5,B00480PTV8,"Exactly what Shawn and M.J. said it would be...a much longer ""Around the Town"".
If you love Shawn and M.J. on YouTube you'll love this. Would be a great stocking stuffer for a fan.
The film is for ages 17 and up~ language
LOL Line: ""That's why we have to be careful when we watch certain types of nude films""
2nd Favorite: ""Holding in a massive duke""
Loved M.J.'s joy at finding a Sizzler and Shawn at finding a unique bean.
Loved the end, it finally answered a question I had from the beginning of the film... or did it?",1289692800,2,521,4.22
4285686,5,B00480PTV8,This movie shows no disappointment to who are bigs fans of Shawn C. Phillips and M.J. Kelly! 5/5 cool movie of 2010,1288915200,3,115,4.2727272727272725

4285688,5,B00480PTV8,"After getting the movie several days after purchasing the movie on here, I finally got the chance to see Around The Country.

I'm glad to say that the movie met my expectations completely. I enjoyed the movie a lot and can see myself popping it into my DVD player on many occasions in the future. And yes, it also can be said that this could be viewed as an extended ""Around the Town"" video, but that is in no shape or form a bad thing! By the end of the movie, I was sad to see it finally over with. The movie is also completely unedited and uncensored. What happens happens, essentially.

The only thing I would have to say on the con side is that I wish there had been some behind the scenes sort of stuff. There's no special features, unfortunately. I wish there had been some sort of commentary or just Shawn and MJ talking about the trip.

Another disappointing thing for the movie is that the repeated mentions of visiting Las Vegas never happened and was completely avoided altogether. Though with the reasoning they used, I suppose it's understandable in some sense.

If you enjoy their ""Around The Town"" videos, then I certainly would expect you to enjoy this movie. Because that's mostly what it is, only much more grandiose. For us fans of Shawn and MJ, this is well worth the money spent.",1288310400,9,1301,4.453781512605042
4285689,5,B00480PTV8,"I watch these guy's on Youtube all the time, they are hilarious. I can't wait till this arrives, should be a lot of fun. In case some of you don't know, this is basically a really long and unedited version of they're around the town videos they do on Youtube :)",1287705600,12,261,4.137254901960785
8418488,5,B00480PTV8,First saw this on Shawns YouTube channel & enjoyed it so I decided to search to see if it was available to purchase on DVD.,1503619200,,123,3.96
8418489,5,B00480PTV8,"Around The Country: The Movie (2010) is was fun movie to be open road of friendship and fun trip, but this is movie was pretty 1 hour and 37 minute s long. Shawn is a perfect cool guys who like talk about movies/series and of course perfect humors too.",1495497600,,252,4.163265306122449

around the country",1442102400,,36,3.625
8418491,4,B00480PTV8,"For those of you that don't know, Shawn C. Phillips and MJ Kelley were two friends that had a youtube show called: ""The Don & Murph Show"". A movie review show in which the two played characters called Don and Murph. When they weren't producing the ""Don & Murph"" show, they had a side show called: ""Around The Town"". A show in which the title explains it all.

Around The Country is the full length, uncensored movie version of ""Around The Town."" Despite it's a documentary, it has a very fictional storyline. Shawn and MJ take a road trip from Baltimore, Maryland to San Diego, California. They will take what three thousand miles of America has to offer!

I think what was supposed to be a fun ride across America turned into a uncomfortable car ride. Not long after this, Shawn and MJ ended their professional and personal relationship.

I give this a high rating because the real honesty it displays. That driving in a car across the country is not the fun you might expect. I would recommend watching their youtube shows leading to this and after to get an idea of what was originally planned for movie and how they came up with the result. Otherwise you're basically buying a home video with two strangers but even that can be interesting. A study of two people.",1392336000,,1267,4.548245614035087
8418492,5,B00480PTV8,This was enjoyable beginning to end and I am a huge fan of Shawn and MJ on youtube. If you are a huge fan of their around the town videos. (like me) Then I would definatly check out this movie because its the around the town movie: Around the country.,1338854400,2,251,4.04
8418493,1,B00480PTV8,"For those of you who were fans, or just enjoyed the coolduder channel on youtube, you may look past much of the laziness of this product. And yes, it is a product. I am disappointed I paid to see this. Some may claim that it is just a feature length ""Around the Town"" vlog.

But we were always able to view Around the Town vlogs for free...some of these vlogs were even 30 minutes or more on the coolduder channel. But if you are a fan of the coolduder channel, you were expecting Shawn and MJ's alter ego's, Don and Murph. They never make an appearance. There was no intro, no music, not even real editing.

 No stories were told. We find out nothing about Shawn and MJ...we hear nothing about their adventures in film making or being a part of other projects. Instead, we sit...and watch a lazy production, almost 70% of it boring. And its pathetic and sad. Pathetic because we realize Shawn is just a large spoiled man child, still sucking off of his parents at the age of 26, and sad, because we know this will be the end of the duo of Shawn and MJ/Don and Murph.

We know Shawn will start his new life, financial backed and secured by his enabling parents, and we know MJ will retreat back to the east coast, probably get a job, get married, and we will never hear from him again.

Everything that drew me into the coolduder channel was this duo. It was don and murph, and their skits. Now its all over.

There was no big send off. No big bang for the fans. They should've had a simple story...like they were being chased or stalked. They could have done this film Blair Witch style, like had a fictional story going on, while we watched them do non-fictional things. Something. Anything. Instead, it was like finding an old tape of your aunt traveling to Pennsylvania, and watching it.

""Oh, look at that. Look at this. OOO...they sell hats here.""

Seriously. Its that boring, that bad. The film starts off with obvious planned pranks, but that's ok. Its still entertaining. But then, shortly after, it all stops. The fun dies out, and instead we just watch a tired Shawn and MJ, bitter and obviously sick of each others presence...and there's still 800 more miles of traveling ahead of them.

This film should have been broken up into parts and placed on youtube for free. It was very unethical to have been sold. This product deserved no profit, save for some ad revenue.  It was marketed and promoted on the coolduder channel, and the details of it were kept pretty secure, so the film would sound more enticing. Shawn even brought up how it was ""not for kids"" over and over again.

The potential customer/fan was led to believe we'd see a very adult side of the duo. Instead, we see a very typical same as always PG-13 side of them, as we have been seeing on youtube for years.

It would have been nice to have seen a very genuine side of the two...really heard their opinions, their feelings on subjects and things...but instead its just two grown adults talking and acting like scared children, and too afraid to open up in any way to their fans.

In closing, this product is a sad, pathetic, depressing nail in the coffin of the now defunct youtube duo that never really launched or got off in the first place. It was made publicly clear that after this trip, Shawn and MJ barely speak to each other anymore.",1323820800,7,3321,4.442434210526316
8418494,5,B00480PTV8,"I bought this when if first was on amazon but just got around to do a review... I am a HUGE fan of the coolduder channel on youtube and so I had to buy this...the movie was well worth the price and I had no problem shelling out a few bucks for it.  It was very funny, alot of cussing but thats fine with me just not a movie to watch with the kids in the room.",1319414400,,359,3.6623376623376624
8418495,5,B00480PTV8,You may go into this movie thinking that you're really watching real people.  What you may not know is that everything is fake.  How is this possible?  I think we all know the only way to do this with modern technology is CGI and Audio Synthesis.  This movie is ahead of it's time.,1294185600,2,281,4.245283018867925
8418496,4,B00480PTV8,"I love Shawn and M.J. This movie was great, as I've been watching their videos for years now. I just wish it would've been longer. I could've gone with a 3 hour movie instead of just an hour and a half. The one thing that I wish the guys would have visited was the dinosaurs that were in Pee Wee's Big Adventure. A commentary or something would have been good, but it's Shawn and M.J. ! Nothing else is necessary.",1291939200,2,413,4.175
8418497,5,B00480PTV8,"I've been a fan of the ""coolduder"" YouTube channel since way back in the day! It was no surprise that I was looking forward to their Around the Country movie!

A word of warning; this movie is exactly like the multitude of Around the Town Shawn and MJ have done. Its 90 minutes of the two talking in the car, hotel rooms, and parking lots about random things and shots of MJ eating. If you don't like the Around the Town videos, then you won't like the Around the Country movie.

With that aside, I could watch these guys for days and I will find myself popping this flick into my DVD player multiple times.

I know some of the pranks where staged, but they always are so I wasn't surprised. Their not too obvious, but you'll know 'em when you see 'em. Also, there is one scene in the middle where the two go to an underground cavern. It's just continuous shots of the caves and is a bit boring.

Anyways, if you're a fan of ""coolduder"" or the Around the Town videos, you owe it to yourself to check this one out! If not, skip it.",1291075200,3,1030,4.186868686868687
