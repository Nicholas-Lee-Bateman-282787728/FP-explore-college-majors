8102392,4,B000DIMF7U,"It even includes some in-depth info on several types of builds, enough that you could probably build one from this alone, if you wanted to chance it. We were certainly intrigued by several I never would have considered before watching this (dirt bag, paper block). Cool and fascinating, well worth the price at this length. Some (maybe most?) of the footage was older, I would be interested in seeing how those dwellings have done over time.",1388793600,,441,4.815789473684211
8102393,1,B000DIMF7U,this DVD tells you plenty of nowt . I didn't learn any thing that I didn't already knew .  waste of money hmmm,1369526400,,110,3.782608695652174
8102394,5,B000DIMF7U,"This video remains an excellent starting point for understanding that Sheetrock and pine is not the only way to make a home.. The video shows many solutions to building a home using various materials. Papercrete and the concrete shell were a couple of concepts that were well demonstrated in this video. All of the owners demonstrated a pride in ownership and accomplishment that comes through in interviews.. I would love a follow up now that many years have passed and they can tell about growing older in their homes, since for so many of them , this was their permanent home.
I enjoyed the pace and details of the video,,",1336608000,,625,4.6909090909090905
8102395,5,B000DIMF7U,This is a great tour of different alternative building methods. Interviews with the owner/builders and in depth discussion of their techniques. Many quirky characters and some surprising buildings make it worth watching.,1306195200,,220,5.90625
8102396,5,B000DIMF7U,"When I bought this DvD, I didn't know anything about green or alternative building methods, and after I watched it, I had a clear idea of which topics I wanted to explore further.
It's a very cosy home-made, but professional documentary, made by Kelly Hart who has been working with alternative buildings for decades.
The DvD takes you first through some basic concepts of energy-efficient design(i.e. passive solar, thermal mass, etc.).
Then Kelly begins to interview different people who are all working with a different building method.(adobe bricks, Rammed Earth, earthships, Straw Bale, Light Concrete, Papercrete, Cordwood, earthbag, hybrids, recycled container)
Every speaker explains their building method quite understandable for an unknowing person.
The dvd doesn't go into too many building details, which I find good for an introduction, and it does leave you with a good basic understanding of every method.
Even though the Dvd is a bit older, the techniques haven't changed over time, and there haven't been any new methods come forward since(I believe) .
Note: This dvd focuses on alternative building techniques, this means people who are looking for info of how to make their already existing conventional home more energy efficient, won't find this info here.

Kelly Hart has also a very good website, [...] which contains alot of extra information on each building technique and he has a fantastic book recommendations list, for any further studies of green building.",1212278400,5,1486,5.323404255319149
