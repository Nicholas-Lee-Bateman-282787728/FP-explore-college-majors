521937,4,6302873150,"Definitely a good Civil War Western, Alvarez Kelly, brings to the screen the story of an American cattle rancher from Mexico who has been hired to deliver a herd of steers to Union troops taking part in military operations during the late stages of the American Civil War.  Things get a bit complicated when the Bluebellies decide that they want the livestock sent to General Grant's army (which is laying siege to Richmond) deep in Grayback territory, instead of the pre-arranged rendezvous point.

The cast carry out their performances very well, though neither the actor, William Holden, nor his character, Alvarez Kelly, are all that wonderful.

Moreover, the title for the movie is not really that great, and the dialogues could have been better too.

Nevertheless, the plot, the setting, the battles and the costumes are all excellent.

Alvarez Kelly brings to life the American Civil War and those desperate moments before the fall of Richmond and the collapse of the Confederacy.

For other wonderful Westerns I would strongly recommend The Outlaw Josey Wales, Major Dundee and The Undefeated.",1142726400,5,1101,5.122905027932961
521938,5,6302873150,"This is a good American Civil War adventure film full of bravado and action. William Holden and a one-eyed Richard Widmark turn in credible and likeable performances as reluctant partners in a raid for Union cattle. It also features Janice Rule, a foppish Patrick O'Neal and a bawdy Victoria Shaw. There are some good skirmish sequences and an interesting plot containing some witty dialogue. Some of the plantation sequences are a little reminiscent of John Ford's THE HORSE SOLDIERS also with Holden. It contains an adequate score composed by Johnny Green of RAINTREE COUNTY distinction and beautiful photography by Joseph MacDonald. The stalwart Edward Dmytryk leisurely directed it for pure cinematic enjoyment. This is the Goodtimes version of this film and the transfer leaves much to be desired.",1135209600,2,802,5.2734375
521939,3,6302873150,"He loved all the westerns!  But this one has Holden & Widmark!  Not only are their scenes together a blast but Holden's scenes with Richard Rust as Sgt. Thatcher made me smile - especially when Rust was Holden's ""watchdog!""  Not a bad storyline, probably because it really happened, a true story, and there are no dull moments.  This is one of those films that you'll just have to take out of the box again some rainy Saturday when you want to remember how fun the 60s were, and our favorite actors of the 40s-50s were making their last cool movies.",1105920000,2,549,4.46
521940,4,6302873150,"Its funny how (to me) lines from movies sometimes bubble to the surface of consciousness from out of nowhere. I hadn't thought about ""Alvarez Kelly"" in years. Recently, in my minds's eye, I recalled the image of an eye-patched Confederate leader named Col. Tom Rossiter,(Richard Widmark) silently and solemnly inquire ""Did you please her.....Kelly""? That simple line was so fraught with innuendo and suggestion that it always stuck with me. So on a rainy Sunday afternoon, I popped a widescreen version of ""Alvarez Kelly"" into my DVD and sat back to review and enjoy this 1966 Civil War oater (or should I say ""beefer"")?  It was a decent ride. Alvarez Kelly (William Holden) enjoys  pursuing the finer things in life, his earthly habits subsidized in part by trading as a cattle speculator or war profiteer depending upon your point of view. In this capacity, he has no particular loyalty to the North or the South. However, and as the opening credits point out, all armies in all times require food as well as armaments to prevail. As the Yankees and the Confederates fight for control over Kelly's 2500 head of cattle, he is unwillingly forced to provide his services to the boys in Gray. This fact in no way serves to curb his rather prodigious libido, and he continues the shameless pursuit of any woman who has the slightest physical beauty. Released in the mid-Sixties, Bond mania was in full swing and I would argue that this film was influenced by and shared some obvious similarities in attitude and tone with agent 007. Anyway, enter Liz Pickering (Janice Rule), the shapely but long suffering intended of Rossiter, a physically diminished yet gallant and honorable leader of the Southern cause. Liz is instantly drawn to Kelly's virility and earthly ways and inevitably, favors are shared. Her rather brief on screen appearance only serves to provide a convienient source of personal friction between Rossiter and Kelly. Inevitably though, the war intrudes and a battle for control of the cattle looms. Kelly, awarded with a battlefield commission takes charge of a desperate situation in his own unique way. The cinematography of this film is crisp. The strong performances by Holden and Widmark really play off each other well. All in all, this Western is elevated a notch or two above the average because of Edward Dmytryk's solid direction, an acceptable musical score although they could have lost the hokey song at the beginning, decent photography, good character actors, an interesting premise and manages to deliver all this in under two hours. Given contemporary standards, I can't help but wonder how Hollywood would handle a randy character like Kelly today.",1018224000,25,2681,5.00896860986547

521942,4,6302873150,"This is an explosive civil war western that packs in a lot of story and character delvopment. Willam Holden stars as Alvarez Kelly a Mexican/Irish cattleman who provides beef for the union army and does not care who wins  the war as long as he gets his money and enjoys a peaceful life. But things  change quickly when Col. Tom Russleter(Widmark)kidnaps Kelly and inprisons  Him. In one of the most memorable scenes in the film Russleter Shoots off  Kelly's little finger to persuade him to help out with the confederate  army, and if he doesn't he'll shoot off his remaininng fingers. Kelly  relucteny agrees but gets back at Russletter by getting his girlfriend to  leave him. Another memorable scene in the film was the heard of cattle  charging through the Union Army's brigade, With Kelly & Russelter at  the helm and by the end of the film both men end up having respect for one  another. Along with ""THE WILD BUNCH"" AND ""BUTCH CASSIDY  & THE SUNDANCE KID"" ""ALVAREZ KELLY"" is a classic Western  film and may not be best remembered as the other two but it still packs in  the same excitement and Story and it's a great film to watch!",962064000,13,1138,4.574257425742574

521964,5,6302873150,"Yesterday, Feb 9, 2017,  after browsing the TV channels I came upon the movie, Alvarez Kelly which I had not heard of. Seeing Richard Widmark and  William Holden were the stars, I watched and recorded it.  When I realized it was about furnishing cattle to the Union Army, I am a descendant of the Old South, it reminded me of the only major battle in Florida that happened in February of 1864 near Lake City Florida., THE BATTLE AT OLUSTEE or OCEON POND. Like the movie, it was fought over Florida furnishing cattle and other supplies to the Confederate Forces. No cattle changed hands like the movie but the battle was over cattle.

In February of 1864, General Quinsy Gilmore sent a Union Army into Florida to stop the Confederates from obtaining cattle to feed their troops. Confederate General Joseph Finnegan  was near Olustee, Florida and repelled the Union Army in the Battle Of ocean Pond. In the Confederate Army was General Alfred Colquit with troops from Georgia. In those troops was The 6th Georgia of which my Great Grandfather was a member of I Company. Also in the Confederate Army was the 27th Georgia with a pair of brothers who became my Great Uncles upon the marriage of my parents.
I would recommend the book and or the movie for all you civil war buffs.",1486684800,,1274,4.619469026548672

522079,5,6302873150,"I like (all my life since a small boy) western films. Some, maybe most of them, are not what one would call great or even very good of the hundreds (thousands of them made?) But I like that kind of story, all of the stuff about the old west, especially if they were somewhat true to how it really may have been.

Some from the past,  1950's, 60's and a number of them from the 80's & 90's and more recently, I think...as Clint Eastwoods ""Unforgiven,"" among some others as well...the good stories that Robert Duvall and Tom Selleck acted in, all fine movies. Then there is William Holden, so big, dominates the screen so much...the presence he has just being the man he was himself. A great actor and like Robert Redford or Spencer Tracy, he just lit up the screen when he appeared. Always I thought he ranked amongst the best of the best in anything I saw him in and this ""Alvarez Kelly"" is a fine example that would take me more time than allowed here to write all I want about the story.

The story is very good, Widmark is good in the part he plays, and since I love the character driven stories especially, even with the war and the cattle drive, somehow the characters shined in this tough, rough western and it leaves me pondering long after I see it every time. It ended well and Holden did not get killed in the end as he has in at least 5 films I can think of at the moment...
I never liked him losing & I am only one of millions that has him as one of the Hollywood heros of all time. You can make up your own ending somewhat or add to it...Kelly has to get to New York to find the girl, etc...Richard Widmark, the Colonel, keeps his word about letting Kelly go (even though Widmark's main man and aide almost kills Holden at the end."" Bill Holden gets to ride off to smile that smile at someone else, use that charm and wit. For many, it reminds us of how he left us much too soon in real life, so young, at 63 I think and still as good as he ever was...one of the especially rare type of actors that will please lovers of good movies for all time.

The movie has some exciting moments in it, but also there are periods that are a little too long. Overall the movie is worth watching.

522107,2,6302873150,"""Alvarez Kelly"" (1966) wastes an impressive amount of talent. William Holden and Richard Widmark - both decidedly miscast - fail to enliven this overlong, hackneyed Civil War adventure. The only memorable sequence in Edward Dmytryk's lackluster Western is a lavish cattle stampede. Johnny Mercer co-wrote the forgettable title song - poorly rendered by The Brothers Four. A few years later, Holden made a triumphant return to the genre in director Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch.""",1288915200,,481,5.426666666666667

I am giving the movie 4 stars because fictitious Alvarez Kelly was supposed to be Mexican-Irish and he did not look or sound either Mexican or Irish. Hollywood legend William Holden was too ""John Wayne"" like. But this is what was working at the time, not exactly OSCAR material, but it sold, this is what characterized  the 60's movies. Putting that aside, the movie is enjoyable. My respects to the real cattlemen during the filming of this movie. Thats a lot of cows! The DVD has both full and wide screen, which I always appreciate.",1200096000,3,904,4.4787878787878785
522112,5,6302873150,"Wonderful adult adventure story with a story that reaches beyond its genre, mixed with subtle humor,an anti-war and anti-hero message, with just enough violence to make it real without making you sick, but no gratuitous sex to help keep the focus of the average 3 1/2-minute attention span. All with a cast that doesn't remind you of your Grade 13 High School class.",1172275200,5,366,4.825396825396825
