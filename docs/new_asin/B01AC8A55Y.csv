8747005,5,B01AC8A55Y,"Based on a true story the film is adapted from 'Joy Adamson's' non-fiction novel  'Born Free'
After Game Warden 'Adamson' (Bill Travers) is forced to kill a Lion that had become a threat to the local community
and a Lioness in self-defence he finds thee cubs (the Lioness had been protecting them) he takes them home to
his wife 'Joy' (Virginia McKenna) to help try and care for them.
After resolving feeding difficulties the three cubs prosper, 'Joy' and 'George' become pretty close to them especially
the smallest of the three who 'Joy' names 'Elsa'
However as the cubs grow larger it will no longer be practical to keep them, arrangements are made for an emplacement
at 'Rotterdam Zoo' ..however realising how upset his wife was in parting them he doesn't place 'Elsa' at the Zoo, he takes
the young Lioness back home much to the joy of his wife as 'Elsa' had always been the one that she'd grown fondest of.
Some time later 'Elsa' caused a herd of Elephants to stampede causing considerable damage to a local settlement, 'George's'
boss 'John Kendall' (Geoffrey Keen) tells the couple that it was no longer practical to keep 'Elsa' and suggested that she be
placed at a Zoo.....however 'Joy' persuades him to give them three months to try and introduce 'Elsa' to a life of freedom on
a game reserve, though he has reservations he agree's to give them the time.
Sadly the attempt to introduce 'Elsa' into the wild with a pride fails miserably, they can't even get 'Elsa' to catch game to feed
herself....they even try to leave 'Elsa' alone to force the issue but find her badly injured just a short while later, 'Elsa' had become
to dependant on 'Joy' and 'George'
'John' gives the couple a little longer to try and successfully release 'Elsa' into the wild.......
A truly delightful story that will pull at your heart-strings as well as giving one a warm feeling...it's a family-friendly feel-good
movie all the more enjoyable because it's a true story.
The film with it's memorable score written and performed by John Barry is in my view a film from yesteryear worthy of a
viewing or indeed re-viewing for many.
(Blu-ray upgrade for this 1966 movie is pretty good)",1494633600,,2170,4.725593667546174
