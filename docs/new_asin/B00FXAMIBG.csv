8619124,2,B00FXAMIBG,"Whats it about?

A French/Arabian co-production in which a family gather after the patriarch dies and secrets are revealed that threaten relationships.

What did I think?

Come on guys. Death as a precursor for forced disclosure of dysfunctional secrets has been done. Having the dead guy (a magical Omar Shariff) narrate the funereal action is a gimmick not used frequently enough to differentiate this from any other film of its ilk. Its all been done  and been done better  before.",1410134400,,484,5.0
