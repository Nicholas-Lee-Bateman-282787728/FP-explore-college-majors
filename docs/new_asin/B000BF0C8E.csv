2415477,5,B000BF0C8E,"The season 2 set of The Rockford Files will include the missing pilot, Backlash of the Hunter that was left out of the first season of the series. Better late than never!!!",1142812800,26,172,4.40625
2415478,5,B000BF0C8E,"I could go on at some length as to the lack of restoration to the film print. The lack of commentaries, etc. However, I would rather spend my time dedicated to the brillance of one James Rockford.

This may be the perfect show. One the one hand you have what may be televisons perfect (and often reluctant) sarcastic ""anti-hero"" mixed with a brillant revolving cast consisting of (and yet NEVER being bogged down by): Dennis Becker (Joe Santos), 'Rocky' (Noah Beery, Jr.), Stuart Margolin -- Evelyn `Angel' Martin, & Gretchen Corbett -- Beth Davenport(GORGEOUS!). There is something so genius about how the sub-characters were used so sparingly and yet so adequately. I have watched about 4 episodes in a row with no ""Rocky"" and yet somehow he isn't missed (though I love him:), the others are right there to create the world of James Rockford. On the other hand you have a soundtrack that perfectly fits the mood of the show and creates it all at once.

I can agree about the episodes being all over the place, though thankfully, I would say 2/3 of them are EXCELLANT and that more than makes up for the ones that are not. I LOVE the new (beautiful!) packaging and can recommend this as a purchase - NO FREEZE UPS - 6 discs - WAY TO GO UNIVERSAL! Please make Quincy Season 3 and the rest of Rockford this way! Lastly, if you have to admit; ANYONE who can make a trailer seem like a cool place to live HAS to be appreciated:)",1141084800,,1425,4.476923076923077

I just know that I love to watch this series and it reminds me of Friday nights, entering the weekend, when I was allowed to stay up late and play in the family room while both my mom and dad would enjoy an episode.  You fall for James Garners portrayal of savvy, streetwise but always put out private detective Jim Rockford who manages to get out of the proverbial hole with a little help from his friends (usually Angel his buddy and fellow ex convict, his dad, and his on-and-off again attorney girlfriend).  One of my favorite episodes from season 2 has Rockford foiling a high end real estate investment swindle by conning the cons into believing that there was oil on their worthless property so that theyd use the swindled monies to pay up for something that didn't have value.  Rockford and compatriot Angel brought in oil rig equipment and made a mess of the front of the club angering residents and back end mobsters alike but he pulled off the con like no other!  I wish I had half of his savvy.  Id be so much smarter then!",1440720000,,1069,4.401015228426396

My wife and I got to see him film part of an episode on location in Studio City, California, in 1976 and that is one of the highlights of my life as a movie and TV fan.

2415538,1,B000BF0C8E,"This season of The Rockford Files undoubtedly had the weakest scripts of any of the 6 seasons.  However, that is not the main problem here.  I would still give Season 2 at least **** because I love the show, except for one thing.  The bonus material on disk 6 is the original series pilot, which is called ""Backlash of the Hunter"" in syndication.  The pilot was 98 minutes long, however the version included with Season 2 is only 73 minutes long.  This irritates me greatly because all of the other episodes on the DVDs of the various seasons are, as far as I can tell, unedited, except for the Season One episode ""This Case is Closed.""  That episode was originally made for a 90 minute TV slot but in syndication was shown as a 2-parter.  The version of ""This Case is Closed"" included with the Season One DVD is the two part syndication version, which is longer, but at least nothing is missing from the original episode.  However over 1/4 of ""Backlash of the Hunter"" has been edited out, and there is no way currently to buy an unedited version on DVD.",1408060800,3,1054,4.453125

2415542,5,B000BF0C8E,"The Rockford Files, with James Garner is interesting and entertaining.  Rockford loves his work and also his girlfriend Beth Davenport.  It is an amazing free spirit show.  Rockford lives by the beach.  The ocean view, his trailer, the setting, everything is
set for a lifestyle set near the elements.  Great storylines and adventures.  More than anything Jim Rockford helps a friend in need

James Garner is perfect for the part and I enjoy watching the episodes because he's a good actor and there's humor in each one - beginning with the message on his answering machine at the beginning of each episode.  The supporting characters are played by actors/actresses who are very likable and also fun to watch.

I also liked the "" Portrait of Elizabeth"" episode with the still hot Gretchen Corbett at her best.

There are only one or two shows on TV these days worth watching (NCIS and Bones). Most of the shows on TV are vulgar, violent, unfunny and promote offensive social or sexual agendas. The comedies (both live and animated) are included in that description and even game shows (Jeopardy clues are starting to be Left-leaning or presented by left-leaning celebrities and celebrity politicians including the current residents of the White House which is disrespectful of the office in my opinion). The reality shows are unreal and stupid with most having mercenary goals. And don't even get me started on the low morals and quality of Saturday morning cartoons.

The program includes his dad which reflects how people can live with their extended family members and still make it work without getting on each others nerves. The violence is never really graphic or discusting and the adult scenes don't reveal alot of sexual content or nudity and that is nice.

When I first watched the series, answering machines were just coming in. I always liked the answering machine shtick of the show. I believe this show inspired me to do a creative message for my 70s answering machine.

The show sussess is in the characters. Besides Rockford himself, I also like Beth and Rocky, and the guy (Isaac Hayes) who called Rockford ""Rockfish"". I was never a fan of Dennis, though, or any of the police.

In seeing these shows again, I realize I had forgotten how the show used some quality people for the parts. This one has Lindsay Wagner, Linda Evans, Stefanie Powers, Rob Reiner, and Louis Gossett Jr.

Of all the characters, it is Angel that I most look forward to because he is such a con. I would like to believe that watching Rockford is all I need to protect myself from Angel types.

The show reminds me of just how ridiculous the clothes were in the 70s. What were we thinking? Fun to watch again.",1336176000,2,1046,4.427083333333333

Rockford always got the oddball cases that put him in tight spots; beat up often, lots of car chases, but he always managed to come out on top with his cons & routines. Co-star his Pontiac Firebird Classic Sports Car, {The Rockfordmobile}, that out-ran all the baddies. His Texas characters, printing press, and routines are classics! Began as a spin-off from Jack Webb's Adam-12, laid the groundwork for the series, with Jim in trouble with the law. (Jim, Jimbo, Jimmy) almost NEVER got paid!
Feb 2005 James Garner received the 41st Lifetime Achievement Award

Season 1 : 23 mostly great eps including 9 Classics! Season 2 : 22 mostly great eps including 8 Classics! Season 3 : 22 mostly great eps including 8 Classics! Season 4 : 21 mostly great eps including 14 Classics!

2415593,5,B000BF0C8E,"Rockford's 1975-76 Season is awesome and is a definite upgrade to this detective dramas 1st Season even though critics indicated that THE ROCKFORD FILES took a big dip in the ratings in Rockford's 2nd Season, which I really find hard to believe and the one thing I really cant understand about this show, since Rockford's flaky persuasive ex-con buddy Angel Martin(Stuart Margolin), my favorite character which was Rockford's sexy attorney girlfriend Beth Davenport(Gretchen Corbett), Rockford's crotchety cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos), and Becker's overzealous superior officer Lt. Diehl(Tom Atkins) all seemed to really start hitting their stride on this private detective drama in this 1975-1976 Season.

In fact, Rockford's 2nd Season is also the season when Joe Santos becomes a permanent and full-time co-star on THE ROCKFORD FILES and when Beth, Angel, and Lt. Diehl started appearing on this show more often as well which made this season more enjoyable to watch than the First Season was along with the fact that the down-on-his-luck PI Jim Rockford(James Garner)had Becker from the LAPD whom he had a love/hate relationship with just like Rick & A.J. Simon(Gerald McRaney, Jameson Parker)who had a love/hate relationship with each other even though they were brothers along with the fact that the Simon brothers had their street-savy cop buddies Det. Marcel ""Downtown"" Brown(Tim Reid)and Lt. Abigail Marsh(Joan McMurtry)from San Diego P.D. on SIMON & SIMON.

In addition to why I like THE ROCKFORD FILES Second Season so much, Rockford's 1975-76 Season was what got me to like and start watching this show a lot more often, especially since Rockford's 2nd Season was a definite upgrade to Rockford's 1st Season, since THE ROCKFORD FILES was pretty much starting to walk in it's Second Season, but was just starting to crawl the First Season throughout THE ROCKFORD FILES whole 6-year run on NBC even though critics say differently.

In addition to that, Rockford's 1975-76 Season was more sophisticated with more action in it than Rockford's 1974-75 Season was especially since Becker and Beth started getting more involved with Rockford and his investigations which often got Rockford in a lot of hot water and often got Becker under fire with his pessimistic superior officer(Lt. Diehl)despised Rockford very much and always looked for excuses to bust Rockford and have his PI license removed, but at the same time it was always kind of funny how Angel would always get Rockford into mischief and how Rockford's nemesis's Lt. Diehl(Tom Atkins) and FBI Agent Dan Shore(Wayne Tippit)would always get sore with Rockford and Becker, especially when Beth defended Rockford and bailed him out of a jam, but Joe Santos later became a co-star on the detective drama MAGNUM, PI as Thomas Magnum's new cop buddy(Lt. Nolan Page) during MAGNUM's 7th and 8th Seasons, which by the way was quite interesting watching Joe Santos go from playing Rockford's cop buddy to Magnum's cop buddy.

Rockford also lived somewhat of a bizarre lifestyle just like Rick & AJ Simon did, since Rockford was a private investigator who was somewhat low-classed, but still had his bronze Pontiac Firebird who often dressed spiffy in 3-piece snazzy suits who lived in a small ragged looking old trailer in a parking lot by the beach in beautiful Malibu, but it kinda makes you wonder how was Rockford able to afford living in a trailer in a parking lot right next to a nice seafood restaurant near a nice L.A. County beach and if anyone even charged him rent to have his trailer space there, especially since Rockford was never rolling in bucks and was a private detective who was always broke and obviously didn't make much money who was often snookered by his clients and was just barely getting by on a shoe-string budget making ends meet trying to make an honest living just like Mannix(Michael Connors), Magnum(Tom Selleck), and Rick & AJ Simon(Gerald McRaney, Jameson Parker)all did, despite that Rockford charged his clients $200 a day plus expenses along with the fact that Rockford frequently got jumped by bigots, get burglarized, get robbed, frequently got shot at, and often had his Firebird racked up too, just like the General Lee often did on THE DUKES OF HAZZARD, plus this show often pointed out what a joke Rockford's cash-flow problem was.

Therefore, you could say that THE ROCKFORD FILES was like a poor-mans MAGNUM, especially since Rockford(James Garner) had a tendency to get himself into a lot of hot water just like Magnum(Tom Selleck) did on MAGNUM, P.I. for very similar reasons, especially since Rockford, Magnum, and the Simon brothers all had cop buddies in the police department who'd help them out in their investigations, but had a lot of cops who resented the hell out of Magnum & Rockford for meddling into a lot of police investigations, since police investigators typically don't like private investigators interferring with police matters.

It was also kind of funny how Rockford kept his gun in the cookie-jar, since most people wouldn't expect to find a gun a place like that and it was neat how Rockford would sometimes end up beating the goons up whenever he'd outsmart them too.

Therefore, THE ROCKFORD FILES was almost like a carbon copy of the private detective show MANNIX, since Joe Mannix was also a private investigator who lived in the L.A. Area near the beach and also got beat up quite a bit too.

I think this was also the season when THE ROCKFORD FILES theme song became a big hit on the radio back in the mid 1970's and I also liked the music scoring that was done by Mike Post & Pete Carpenter on this show, especially since they used a lot of harmonica in their music composing on THE ROCKFORD FILES, which I thought was pretty cool, which made the music scoring sound kind of Country Westernish, kind of like THE DUKES OF HAZZARD's music scoring was.

Additionally, it's nice to be able to have this private detective drama out on DVD complete & uncut like they were originally shown on their original air dates on NBC with the exception of no commercials, especially since they had deleted too many scenes when THE ROCKFORD FILES was on cable TV like when it was on A&E, TNN, TV Land, WGN, and MeTV; in order for cable TV networks to allow more time for more commercials in between, which is what cable TV and local TV stations do with every show that gets converted into reruns.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Michael Conrad in the ""Deep Blue Sleep"" episode before his co-starring days as Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on the police drama HILL STREET BLUES

*James Luisi guest starring in the ""Joey Blue Eyes"" episode before his co-starring days as Becker's disgruntled superior officer(Lt. Chapman) and before James Luisi's co-starring days on the soap opera ANOTHER WORLD

*Dana Elcar in ""The Great Blue Lake Land & Development Company"" episode before his co-starring days on MACGYVER

*Gerald McRaney in ""The Farnsworth Strategem"" episode before he was even a star and before his co-starring days as the short-tempered gonzo private investigator(Rick Simon) on SIMON & SIMON and before his co-starring days on MAJOR DAD and TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL

*Tom Atkins co-starring as Becker's superior officer(Lt. Diehl) before co-starring in John Carpenter's THE FOG and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK.

*Richard Herd in the ""Pastorias Prime Pick"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Sheridan on TJ HOOKER

*William Daniels in the ""Italian Bird Fiasco"" episode before his days as Dr. Mark Craig on ST. ELSEWHERE and doing KITT's voice on KNIGHT RIDER

*Rob Reiner in ""The No-Cut Contract"" episode during his co-starring days as Meathead on ALL IN THE FAMILY

*Bill Lucking in the ""Pastoria's Prime Pick"" episode before his co-starring days as the incompetent Army nemesis(Col. Lynch) on THE A-TEAM

*Noble Willingham in ""The Great Blue Lake & Development Company"" episode before his co-starring days on WALKER TEXAS RANGER

*Bill Boyett in the ""Two Into 5.56 Wont Go"" episode after his co-starring days as Sgt. MacDonald on ADAM-12

*Richard Venture in the ""In Hazard"" episode before his co-starring days as the hard-nosed(Cmdr. Leo Altobelli)on the short-lived STREET HAWK

*Jonathan Goldsmith in ""The Aaron Ironwood School of Success"" episode before his co-starring days on DALLAS

Rockford's 1975-76 Season takes me all the way back to memory lane to the days when I was 3 years old and living in my hometown(El Centro, CA)where I was raised at since I had lived in the Imperial Valley for 21 years, which by the way is a small rural community in the Desert Southwest that is almost always oppresively hot and always ultimately boring.

Unfortunately, NBC had cancelled THE ROCKFORD FILES all of the sudden in the middle of its 6th and last season back in the Winter of 1980, due to James Garner having health problems and showed us Rockford's final episode ""Deadlock In Parma"" on Thursday January 10, 1980, but Rockford had still inspired the premiere of newer detective shows in the 80's like MAGNUM, P.I. which debuted on CBS in the late Fall of 1980 and SIMON & SIMON which made its debut on CBS in the mid-Fall of 1981.

In the meantime, I just got word that Paramount will finally be releasing the detective drama MATT HOUSTON's 1st Season out on DVD on Tuesday March 9th, 2010 and that the Shout Factory will be releasing SIMON & SIMON-Season 4 on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 and are both available to pre-order which gives us 2 private detective dramas in the works to look forward to watching in the Spring of 2010.",1226966400,5,10138,4.956982911019446

2415597,4,B000BF0C8E,"James Garner absolutely shone in this role. Twenty-two episodes here prove why he is considered one of this country's greatest actors. Garner could do it all; romantic leading man, tough guy, western hero & his comedic abilities were, perhaps, his strongest area.

This series was practically tailor made for Garner being, essentially, an update of the Maverick character he had portrayed fifteen years earlier. When Stephen Cannell pitched this series to Roy Huggins (creator of Maverick & The Fugitive), Huggins told him the same thing: This is Maverick updated! Get Jim Garner to play the role.

Bonus features include the original Rockford Files pilot which ran as a Movie of the Week. It's about 72 minutes long & full of vintage Rockford, There are some subtle differences from the subsequent series, the most notable being another actor portraying his father.

2415600,5,B000BF0C8E,"""The Rockford Files"" was a wildly popular, and now, iconographic, television detective series based on the life and work of Jim Rockford, a private detective living in southern California in the 1970's. The series is undoubtedly one of the best television shows ever produced: so good that one almost winces when the word ""television"" is mentioned in context with the show. Although television was the format and forum for the series, the work lays clearly outside the norms of ""good television,"" and moves into areas generally only found in film and drama.

Jim is a genuinely good-hearted, but nevertheless cynical, hero of the common man who makes his sometimes meager income pursuing his unusual and often dangerous job. As an ex-con himself who spent time in jail for a crime he did not commit (and for which he eventually received a full pardon), Jim's street smarts equip him to move through all types of dangerous and unexpectedly dramatic situations that arise as he works his way through his revolving caseload, the ""files"" part of ""The Rockford Files.""  Jim's response to questions about his daily rate, usually asked by someone in most every episode, is ""200 dollars a day, plus expenses."" Jim's duties might be to look for a missing person, collect on a debt owed, solve a crime, or anything else that someone might hire a private detective to do.

Jim makes frequent use of his friend in Los Angeles Police Department, Sgt. Dennis Becker, to get important information, but as often as not, pays the favors back by providing help to Becker which allowed Becker to make arrests.  Jim claims to be averse to picking up any job that involves real danger. He owns a gun, but rarely uses it, and makes a point of telling anyone who will listen that he doesn't like guns. Nevertheless, it is Jim's care for the individual that generally moves him into danger to help someone else in need. His closest real friend, Angel Martin, is a small-time grifter and con artist who is always trying to con someone out of a few dollars, but never manages to lose Jim's friendship for reasons that may rest more with Jim's sense of responsibility to a person who needs SOMEONE to care for him than for more selfish reasons.

Jim's gold Pontiac Firebird became one of the enduring visual representations of the decade. The car was routinely bruised, dinged, crashed, vandalized, and in one episode, even blown up, but was nevertheless kept in steady repair throughout the entire run of the series. Few automobiles have been so closely identified with a dramatic character while never being the central focus of attention.

The Rockford Files was well-known for extremely strong plot lines, with virtually every episode in the run of the series an outstanding piece of dramatic writing and acting set to full musical score. The music in the first season or two is often exceptionally strong, where we often discover entire episodes seemingly a continuous musical score underpinning the story. (The theme song for the series, played at the beginning of every episode and revisted within episodes as variations on a theme, was immensely popular during the series run, and was catchy enought to be released commercially on the radio waves at some point in the show's run.) Individual episodes focus on a variety of themes, either comic, intrigue, mystery, problem solving, and others, but the common thread in them all is life as viewed through the lens and experiences of Jim's efforts to stay out of trouble while he faces trouble. Episodes typically contains enough twists and turns to keep even the most seasoned watcher on the edge of the seat in trying to figure out the angle or angles that are at play. The commanding and reassuring presence of James Garner, a greatly-loved figure in American movies and television, carries virtually every scene while keeping the plot believable and engaging. The fact that the series could maintain such high levels of realistic credibility while not allowing the viewer to assemble all the pieces until the near end of each episode is simply a marvel of narrative storytelling. These are some of the best examples of premier storytelling in the history of television, and arguably, film.

Many reviews of television shows contain lists of ""best"" episodes. In my own mind, it is simply not possible to create such a list for The Rockford Files. To do so would perhaps do some injustice to the series, because virtually every episode is ""good"" in the basic sense.  Yes, there are indeed some episodes that are archetypical examples of mastery in video storytelling, but to be perfectly honest, you can basically pick any episode of The Rockford Files at random, and, assuming you understand the basic premise of the show, chances are you'll have a great viewing experience.  But perhaps this is a series best watched by starting with Season One, and watching each episode in order, so that one can fully appreciate the cast of characters, their relationship to one another, and the unfolding story of Jim's life. Along the way, we come to love Rocky as a father and human being, appreciate Denis as an honest and hard-working police officer,  admire Beth as a skilled and knowledgeable lawyer, and feel some level of understanding, and yes, even sympathy, for Angel as he cons his way through small-time scams. Running through it all is Jim, a person who often puts others above himself, and has a touch of humanity that appeals to most everyone, and easily makes the series one of the most endearing to ever appear on television.",1183161600,4,5562,4.88865323435843

He is a reputable tough guy with great charisma and was a great asset in the pilot. Rocky and Angel really develop their roles as well.

Both Seasons Two and Three contain nice single-sided disks in a fold-out package rather than the individual slim-line cases of Season One.

2415624,5,B000BF0C8E,"Last year TV Guide called The Rockford Files the greatest detective series ever.  Tall order that, considering all the detective shows in the history of American television.  I, for one, think such praise is truly deserved.  What sets this series apart, I believe, is the tone set by its leading man, James Garner.  You can just sit back and relax in knowing that Jim Rockford will solve the case in his own personal self-deprecating style.  You can count on at least one car chase, a fist fight or two, and a healthy dose of 'tongue in cheek' humor.  The show never takes itself too seriously, and that's a plus.  Great characters abound, from Rocky to Beth, Angel to Dennis, all built around the only actor that could've pulled off the lead role with charisma to spare.  Like Jack Klugman with 'Quincy' or Peter Falk's Lt Columbo, only Mister Garner could pull off Jim Rockford and make it work.

Season two, if anyting, is clearer than season one, and with better packaging.  The audio is crisp and clear.  Bring on season three of this landmark series.  Like another recent purchase, 'Wild Wild West, Season One', I never tire of it.",1156723200,2,1137,4.658291457286432

James Garner is still one of our favorite actors and he was such a natural in this series. His Rockford character was such an honest portrayal of the everyday man.  He was funny, charming,honorable, and very much human.  He won some, he lost some.

2415629,5,B000BF0C8E,"Jim Rockford returns in the second season checking out more ""closed cases"" and solving them. Part of the charm of ""The Rockford Files"" was the witty dialogue and the interplay of James Garner with the memorable cast. Although the second season isn't quite as strong as the third season the show would return to full strength and produce some of its best episodes from season three on. The show fell out of the top ten and ranked third in its time slot for season two primarily because of the change in focus of the scripts. Roy Huggins left the show, the scripts had Rockford playing the patsy to some of his clients when he was usually smarter than just about everyone else in figuring things out. With the third season Rockford steadied with new strong scripts from Juantia Barlett, David Chase (""The Sopranos"")and Stephen J. Cannell. Nevertheless, the second season still had plenty of gems to make it worthwhile for fans of the show.

Picture and sound are good for all the episodes. Color is quite good as well although the shows have faded a bit with time. This set improves on the previous one in that Universal has stopped using those pesky 2 sided discs. We get the show on six dual layered single sided discs with nice artwork on the label. The show is presented in a fold out cover with the discs on top of each other. I do wish that the show had been put in slimline cases like the first season but the packaging is still handsome.

As Stephen Cannell points out in the interview producer Roy Huggins who created ""Maverick"" saw that Cannell's script was a modern day take on that series and immediately contacted James Garner thus began the best detective show (with humor)on TV. The networks were constantly pressuring the producers to take the humor out as they clearly didn't understand the show's appeal. Garner's charm and low key demeanor works well with this series. Now if I can only get my favorite cancelled series Garner's ""Nichols"", I'll be happy.

A 10 minute interview with co-creator/writer/producer Stephen J. Cannell who discusses the genesis of the show, how it was rejected by ABC and how he noticed that detectives on TV were never paid which is why he has Rockford be up front about money for his services.

The second extra is the 80 minute pilot episode which somehow wasn't put on the first season set. It's nice to have it here as we can see all the elements that made the series click from Rockford's low key demeanor to how his mind works at figuring out who did what to whom and why. We also get some terrific guest stars including Lindsay Wagner in the pilot as a woman trying to find out why her derelict father was murdered. Bill Mumy (""Lost in Space"") appears as her brother and the supporting cast is top notch. These appear to be the originally aired versions not the syndicated ones that we're cut a bit.

One complaint I have--Universal, would it hurt you to have a commentary track or two on the next set? It would be nice to have Garner (if he's willing)with one of his co-stars or even Cannell and some of the other writers discussing one of the pivotal episodes of the season. I'd be happy with a featurette on the third season as well as some of the best episodes of the series appeared during that year.",1153353600,10,3257,4.551194539249146
2415630,5,B000BF0C8E,"What a big difference from Season One in the packaging for Season Two of The Rockford Files. Finally, Universal pulls out some stops and starts giving this landmark series the respect it deserves.

Gone is the uninspired, let's-put-something-together design and gone are the horrid double-sided discs. Amazingly enough, all of the discs from Season Two even work in my standard DVD player (unlike my order of the first season)!

As for the episodes, Lou Gossett, Jr.'s brilliant comedic turn as Jim's smooth-talking ex-parole officer in Foul On the First Play is a must-see (again) classic.

Guest star Rob Reiner as a pathetic would-be football celebrity in The No-Cut Contract still alternately makes me cringe with pity for the character, then laugh out loud, and of course, James Garner's street-smart, ""received a full pardon"" Rockford, along with his co-horts Angel, Rocky, Beth and Dennis, is what's made me watch the show for over 30 years, and what will keep me watching for the next 30.

He's sarcastic and a guy who bases his actions on real life--not a bunch of rigid rules.  The relationship between he and this father is so special, yet believable.",1153094400,2,380,4.641791044776119
2415633,4,B000BF0C8E,"The packaging of the Second Season is great.  My favorite episodes on this compilation were Pastoria Prime Pick and the original pilot  series ""Backlash of the Hunter"" with Lindsay
Wagner. Lindsay alone makes the whole thing worthwhile. I'm not into idolizing Hollywood women, but she and Gretchen Corbett (Beth Davenport)are natural, sensuous beauties.

In the second Season you see more of the secondary characters such as the obnoxious Angel Martin and the little hottie, Beth Davenport. It is always fun to see Rockford drive two different model year Firebirds in one episode (a 73 and a 75, I think), Joey Blue Eyes. Its a kick to see him step all over himself when he gives a stranger $10,000 in ""The Great Blue Lake Land Development Company"". Its hilarious how he gets Rocky and his former cell mate Fast Harry (who Rocky wouldn't take to a chicken fight!) involved to get the money back. You also gotta love the titles to these episodes! Garners classic dialog is also great throughout the series.

I found Season One to be stronger, but there is nothing wrong with Season Two. Universal, I don't want to wait till I'm 90 to get season Three and Four. GET BUSY!!!

I also want that we continue to get the small bonus items like more interviews, show trailers, and maybe some old Pontiac Firebird advertisements. It would also be interesting to hear from Mike Post and Pete Carpenter, the people who worote the Rockford Files theme and the excellent background music throughout the CD.

I also want a repackaging of Season One by Christmas. I think Rockfords best season deserves better treatment than it got. Suggestion includes: 6 disks, more interviews, and maybe some printable materials. It would be nice to know more on how the Rockford Files came into being for the first season. Anyway, Universal has their work cut out for them. :)",1151798400,3,1847,4.8107255520504735
2415634,5,B000BF0C8E,"The boxed set of the 2nd season of The Rockford Files is a true pleasure to watch.  In fact, I have to pace myself and only allow myself to watch one episode per day.  Like a fine wine, this series is to be savored and enjoyed for the gem that it is.  The packaging is much better than with season 1, and I found the interview with Steven J Cannell to be interesting.  But the performances of James Garner are not to be topped by any dramatic series on television.  I was particularly impressed by the way his relationship with his dad was handled: warm and caring, but not sappy.  Gearjammers (2 part episode) was a great opportunity to learn more about Jim and Rocky's relationship.  Noah Beery did an outstanding job.  One plus that I haven't heard mentioned is that the season 2 box has the ""better"" theme song starting out each episode.  If I recall, this is the edit of the Mike Post radio version that is more jammin' than the original first season theme song.

In addition, the audio and print quality are excellent, even on a large screen.

Great stuff, and I can't wait for season 3.",1151366400,15,1093,4.388059701492537
2415635,5,B000BF0C8E,"I got season 2 delivered by Amazon just two days after it was released, and I watched all 23 shows over three days.

First, these are great episodes,Garner is even better, his character has more depth, and more backstory is given for Rockford, and his friends-angel, dennis, beth- all are used more in the show, and they are also made deeper characters.  These episodes should please most fans, but the series dipped here a little (and rebounded the next 3 1/2 seasons), and there are reasons why.

I had been warned that season two was the weak season of the series, by reading the book 30 years of the Rockford Files (sold by Amazon).  Normally, when something is brand new on DVD (like, I'm catching up on two seasons of Lost and House), I will avoid all television previews, print, TV guides, etc, so nothing is spoiled.  I barely remember the specific plots for Rockford anyways (I was in Junior High and High School), so it's like a new show.  However, my eyes wandered past season 1 in the book (a great book), and drifted to season two behind the scenes stories.  Perhaps this was good, because I was prepared for some of the weaknesses of these season 2 eppies, but pleasantly surprised that they overcame some of the problems.

Basically, with Stephen Cannell at the helm without Roy Huggins, who left the show after season 1, things slipped from the tried and true format of season 1.  The balance, for me, of humor, well-paced action, and a little violence, drifted towards more (silly) humor, less action.

The scripts are overall outstanding, however, much more complicated plots and better writing for most of the episodes.  But, a lot of the car chases, kidnapped by the goons in wide ties in the big 70's cars, punches in the gut are gone.  It may be Stephen Cannell and his more ""A-Team"" personality coming out, and it is also probably the networks and the FCC enforcing the ""less violence"" and ""family viewing"" pressures of the 1970s.

But, buy these DVDS and wonder why James Garner didn't win the Emmy every year in  row !!!  I looked up the Emmy Awards history for Best Actor, 1974 - 1980, and Garner did have some good company-he lost to Peter Falk and Ed Asner, and some guy in a show that lasted only one season.  But come on, only winning his Best Actor once?  I don't think the show won, either.  But then, the Odd Couple was a low rated show when it aired, and it exploded during syndication (and Star Trek's cancellation and success later on is legendary).

2415638,5,B000BF0C8E,"Universal did a lot better job of producing the season 2 DVDs. They got rid of the 2 sided ""flipper"" discs and replaced them with single sided DVDs. So instead of 3 ""flipper"" DVDs you get 6 single sided DVDs. It's nice to have one side printed so you can set these down on that side and not have to worry about scratching the data side. It's also nice to be able to easily read the label instead of  the tiny one around the hole like in the season 1 DVDs.  Also the DVD package looks better than the Season 1 DVD package. The package is one case that folds out to a tri-fold and contains all 6 discs. And unlike the Season 1 cases, the interior is not blank but contains scenes from the show. This Set of DVDs includes the series pilot ""Backlash of the Hunter"" with Lindsay Wagner, Stuart Margolin, Bill Mumy(of LOST IN SPACE and BABYLON 5 fame), William Smith(who took over for James MacArthur in the last season of HAWAII 5-0), and Robert Donley as Joseph Rockford, Jim's dad. In the rest of the series this was switched to Noah Berry Jr. as Jim's dad. This was a good switch because Berry plays Jim's dad with a lot more charisma.

2415639,5,B000BF0C8E,"James Garner is probably the hardest working television

actor of them all. My favorite shows are Columbo, Mission: Impossible and the Rockford Files, but as an actor, Garner outclasses them all. As good as Columbo is, Peter Falk is puts in uneven performances.  In Mission:Impossible, the focus continually shifts from one character to another, so no one

actor is on the spot all the time. In ""Rockford Files"", the story revolves around Jim so he is on screen much of the time,

yet he NEVER puts in a bad performance, in spite of what must

have been an exhausting schedule, putting out a new show week after week.  Of course, the outstanding writing and directing add to the charm of the program.  I was in college in Southern California while the show was being produced so I can attest to how well the show reflected the slightly wacky society of the time and in the various odd types of people Jim encounters.",1148947200,28,916,4.617283950617284

2415642,5,B000BF0C8E,"Fans were ecstatic when ""The Rockford Files"" finally was released after many long delays. The first season was great and the second cemented James Garner and his pals as weekly visitors into our homes for years to come.

James Garner's laconic charm as Jim Rockford kept us coming back for more each week and finally won him an Emmy in 1977. Garner, who would have been a star in any era, and sometimes seemed as if he would have fit more into films of the 1940's, had finally found the perfect role on television as Jim Rockford, an ex-con given a full pardon when it was discovered he was innocent after all. Working as a P.I. and parking his gold Firebird in front of his trailor on the L.A. beach, Rockford could never quite shake the ex-con tag, nor could he shake his old cellmate, Evelyn ""Angel"" Martin.

Stuart Margolin was simply fantastic as the scheming Angel, always with an angle, and always certain to get Rockford into trouble when it backfired. Like Rockford, you just couldn't stay mad at Angel, no matter what con had blown up in his face or how much trouble he would get our favorite TV detective in from time to time. Rockford and Angel remained friends because of that unspoken bond all ex-cons have, and because deep down, Angel was a stand-up guy, though you couldn't always tell it from looking at the surface.

Except for the 90 minute pilot episode, ""Backlash of the Hunter,"" starring Lindsay Wagner as Sarah Butler, who would resurface in another episode from that first season, ""Aura Lee, Farewell,"" Noah Beery Jr. portrayed Rockford's lovable dad, Rocky. Rocky was a retired trucker who loved to fish, and passed on the hobby to Jim. It was the little moments like fishing that were really the heart and soul of this show when you stop to think about it. There were always a few slice-of-life moments mingled in with the great car chases, glorious con games, and other assorted mischief, as Rockford tried to solve a closed case and stay out of jail at the same time. Some weeks he was just trying to stay alive. Rocky would always give Jim that ""look"" if he had to come post bail.

Joe Santos was Rockford's often exasperated police pal, Dennis Becker. He was the buffer between Rockford and Becker's superiors, who hated Rockford and wanted any excuse to pull his P.I. license. Becker was a pal, but could only do so much for Jim as he had to stay out of hot water himself. He had a wife and kids to support, and for some strange reason, that sometimes took priority over helping Rockford out of a complicated jam.

Last, but by no means least, was Gretchen Corbett as lawyer Beth Davenport. The relationship between she and Rockford was complicated. They both had a deep affection for each other, which was sometimes complicated by the attorney-client relationship. Her efforts to keep Jim out of trouble with the cops took up a lot of her time. There was a romance of sorts between the two, but it never matured into something that would lead to marriage.

The second season, just like the first, had some great guest stars, in addition to the already mentioned Lindsay Wagner. That original pilot episode is included this time. Guest stars from the second season include: Linda Evans, Michael Conrad, Stefanie Powers, Blair Brown, Isaac Hayes, Rob Reiner, Dick Butkus, John Saxon, Michael Ansara, Joseph Campanella, Louis Gossat Jr., Susan Strasberg, and Veronica Hamel.

There were some fine episodes the second season, in addition to the 90 minute pilot finally included. Those episodes are as follows: THE AARON IRONWOOD SCHOOL OF SUCCESS --- THE FARNSWORTH STRATAGEM --- THE GEARJAMMERS --- THE DEEP BLUE SLEEP --- THE GREAT BLUE LAKELAND AND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY --- THE REAL EASY RED DOG --- RESURRECTION IN BLACK AND WHITE --- CHICKEN LITTLE IS A LITTLE CHICKEN --- TWO INTO 556 WONT GO --- PASTORIA, PRIME PICK --- THE REINCARNATION OF ANGIE --- THE GIRL IN THE BAY CITY BOY'S CLUB --- THE HAMMER OF 'C' BLOCK --- THE NO-CUT CONTRACT --- A PORTRAIT OF ELIZABETH --- JOEY BLUE EYES --- IN HAZARD --- THE ITALIAN BIRD FIASCO --- WHERE'S HOUSTON? --- FOUL ON THE FIRST PLAY --- A BAD DEAL IN THE VALLEY

Stephen J. Cannell and Roy Huggins created this wonderful series and Juanita Bartlett wrote some of the finest scripts ever done for television. James Garner was absolutely perfect as Jim Rockford, and it has become difficult as the years have passed to separate the two in our minds. Garner was, and is, a great actor and screen presence who made everything look easy. This was a terrific show and one of the best ever to be beamed into our homes once a week.

This DVD sets of ""The Rockford Files"" have been too long coming, but now we all can wax nostalgia a bit, remembering shows like ""The Rockford Files"" which entertained with quality. Everyone loved ""The Rockford Files"" and couldn't wait to hear Mike Post's great theme music each week. It was recorded and turned into a radio hit it was so good.

Once again we will get to listen to all those crazy messages left on Jim Rockford's answering machine. Fans never missed the opening of the show because a smile or a good laugh might be missed. You don't want to miss it either.
