1342182,5,B00004RERO,"I've been looking for this wonderful musical for years, and couldn't believe it wasn't available on video. I first saw it about 12 years ago on TV, then once again while traveling in Germany, but never even got to tape  it. The dancing is spectacular, and the music is beautiful. And don't think  you know the whole plot -- there is a twist to this Cinderella Story!",952732800,3,366,4.447761194029851
1342183,5,B00004RERO,"I first saw this movie about 4 years ago on HBO.  It stayed in my memory ever since then, and one day, when I came home from school it was on the Romance Channel.  Imagine my surprise!  I sat and watched the whole thing,  I taped it as well, and I remembered all the songs by heart!  It is such a  good movie. It by far surpasses all the Cinderella movies I have seen.  Emma and Richard are two of the best actors I have seen.  The scenery is  beautiful, the songs are supurb, and the acting is just very well done.  Its extremely romantic, if you are into that kind of thing.  Even if you  are not, it is the best movie for people of all ages.  If I could give it  more than 5 stars, believe me, I would!",952646400,2,705,3.9078014184397163
1342184,5,B00004RERO,"I first saw this movie as a teenager and have loved it ever since.  I too, had a very poor copy taped off T.V. that was almost worn out.  The songs are wonderful (who can forget ""A bride-finding ball""?) and the  scenery is beautiful.  I wish that I could give more than 5 stars for this  wonderful movie.",952473600,4,304,4.172413793103448
1342185,5,B00004RERO,"I have loved this movie since I was 12 years old!  It is a great musical and I have never been able to understand why it has not received more attention.  It is a wonderful retelling of the Cinderella story with  well-drawn and interesting characters.  It even has an unexpected little  twist in the plot (no, I won't say what it is - buy it and see for  yourself!) that gives some weight to the emotions of the main characters.  It would be so easy to treat this lightly because of how familiar everyone  is with the fairy tale. This movie has a little more depth.  The music is  really great and the dancing more than keeps up with it. Do yourself a  favor and see this musical!",951868800,3,680,4.234375
1342186,5,B00004RERO,"My dance teacher made us (eh.. forced) to watch this movie in edition to THE RED SHOES. At first, our entire class was bored to death with the opening scenes, but soon we were fish bait: hook, line, and sinker. We were  sad to see it end, and we all agree it's fabulous in it's entirety. If you  can withstand 40 minutes of boredom, you will be in for a real treat!",951782400,2,365,4.055555555555555
1342187,5,B00004RERO,"Along with many other fans of ""The Slipper and The Rose""  I was delighted to finally hear through Jenni's website that this tremendous and beautiful musical was to finally be released on home video.  No longer will  I have to rely on a taped from tv copy!  This musical has everything you  could want-humor,drama,suspence, spectacular dancing, and a musical score  that leaves one humming the tunes joyously. Lavish costumes and scenery add  to the enjoyable story-telling of this  truly enchanting version of the  classic fairy tale ""Cinderella"".",951350400,5,547,5.195402298850575
1342188,5,B00004RERO,"I think I was about five years old when I first saw this movie, and immediately I was hooked. It tells the story of Cinderella, and has to be one of the most lavish tellings of the tale that I have ever seen. The sets  and scenery are beautiful, as are the magnificent houses which remind me of  the castles we all longed to live in as young children.  All roles in the  film are cast perfectly, especially Margaret Lockwood as the wicked  stepmother, who makes life hellish for our beautiful heroine.
The  Slipper and the Rose, never takes itself too seriously, but at all times  remains engaging. At the time of its theatrical release, this film was not  received well, however everyone that I know who has seen it, has remarked  on what a fun, witty, and romantic film it is, with fantastic music and  songs that you hum for days afterwards.  Definitely one for the collection.",950918400,20,880,4.506329113924051

1342191,4,B00004RERO,"I have loved this movie since I first saw it several years ago, and have been searching for a copy of it on VHS for years.  It is charming, eccentric, and funny.  It can't decide whether to be serious or campy, and  is certainly at it's best when it's campy!  Some great moments.  If you  always wanted to see Richard Chamberlain sing and dance, now's your chance!",950745600,2,364,4.358208955223881

1342222,1,B00004RERO,"I love Cinderella movies and the Victorian era.  So I should have easily loved this version as well.  Sadly no.  I don't know if it's the age of this movie, the story, or the bad singing.  Maybe it was too long.  Either way I've tried several times to get through this movie.  Twice I feel asleep.  Other times I just couldn't take it anymore.  I was just bored out of my mind.  I highly recommend Ever After.  I also suggest the original Disney cartoon, or especially their newer live action remake.  I also suggest the ABC made for TV movie Cinderella starring Brandy.  Stay away from this version onless you love old, slow, boring movies.",1501372800,,641,4.478260869565218

1342452,5,B00004RERO,"There are a number of becauses as to why THE SLIPPER AND THE ROSE should be celebrated instead of deposited in some dark corner of cinema's attic. For one, and as of yet, no other movie has strived to expand on the Cinderella mythos as comprehensively as did this one. It sucks mightily that this 1976 British musical flew under most everyone's radar when it debuted in the States one year later in 1977. But 1977 turned out to be the year of SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and THE GOODBYE GIRL... and, toweringly, the year of STAR WARS.

I had the awesome pleasure to see this movie again, after not having seen it for decades, thanks to TCM's premiering it a few Sundays ago (2/21/16), uncut and in widescreen. TCM's version ran a near 2 hours, 30 minutes, meaning the stuff that had been excised down the years had been re-inserted.

I had never heard of Gemma Craven before this picture, and, frankly, I haven't heard of her since. She is delectable! She leaves a fresh and indelible impression as the sweet, long-suffering Cinderella or, as I'd rather refer to her, as the Princess Incognita. The movie hits all the traditional beats of the classic rags-to-riches fairy tale. It also delves curiously deeper into the back story. Richard Chamberlain as Prince Edward, wilful heir to the throne of Euphrania, is very much a presence onscreen, him who'd rather not be married off to some princess what's given to swoons and vapors. No, he'd rather for true love, never mind the pressing issues of certain matters of state (ie: preventing a war and perpetuating the royal lineage). Ah, but besides Ms. Craven, the one who caught my eye  is the delightful Annette Crosbie as the Fairy Godmother. I happen to think that Ms. Crosbie flashes the most impish, most sly grin ever. There are subversive touches in this movie, courtesy mostly of Ms. Crosbie's anachronistic turn. Too, there is pointed commentary about class distinction as framed in the smartly staged ""Position and Positioning"" number.

Other folks have lauded the songs as universally solid, and everyone's entitled to opinions. To me, the songs by the Sherman brothers were just aw-ight and come off as narrative padding, with two remarkable exceptions: ""He Danced With Me/She Danced With Me"" and the ever-so-haunting ""Tell Him Anything (But Not That I Love Him)"". Gratifyingly, the cast perform their own numbers and comport themselves admirably, even Chamberlain whom I'd never once pictured as a singer or hoofer.

Three months, six days elapse from that momentous bride-finding ball to when the prince at last finds the wearer of the glass slipper. There you'd think the story's done. No. It presses on, smacks a third act to the tale, introduces one more impossible obstacle, compels the fairy godmother to perform one last bit of prestidigitation, causes her to grumble: ""I suppose I shall simply have to rise to the occasion and do something spectacular yet again. And spectacular always takes so much out of me.""

It's a bit jarring to behold Margaret Lockwood as the vile step-mother, what with my crushing on her hard in THE LADY VANISHES (1938) and NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH (1940). But change is good, and Lockwood, here cruel and covetous, is one more asset to make THE SLIPPER AND THE ROSE a watchable experience. It's also neat how the movie approached its special effects. Obviously, CGI was non-existent back in the 1970s. The crew instead made do with practical sleight-of-hand, with visual legerdemain, such as the camera's pan away and then back to the table to showcase a miraculously manifested plate of food, courtesy, undoubtedly, of some quick-change assistant who placed the prop just so when the camera was looking away. It is wondrous artifice, executed with elegant simplicity that made me grin real big. Just one more thing to qualify this as an overlooked gem. And if nothing else, there's a quote here from the fairy godmother to Cinderella that guides people who don't quite know how to react to someone's doing them a favor or complimenting them: ""You are not meant to understand it. You are meant to accept it graciously.""",1457136000,2,4146,4.86543909348442

I probably would have bought it and then would have been so mad at the money wasted. It certainly had some good actors, but it was really boring.  The tunes were unmemorable although the lyrics were clever in places. It was so bad, in places, it was funny. Richard Chamberlain leaping around in the mausoleum and swinging from the rafters with his buddy John was an eye-rolling hoot.",1456876800,,555,4.4950495049504955

And this is the best one I have ever seen (with Ever After a close second). The costumes are dazzling. The songs SO funny (ok, two are boring, but the rest are great). The twist at the end is unexpected, and so doubly enjoyable. I ADORE the godmother... she is the best and funniest here compared to all others I've seen (as well as more actively involved than other versions).

All my friends and I memorized the words to every song! But then it was never seen on TV again, no DVDs, no nothing. After all these years I was beginning to think I had imagined it ... until ... PRIME! I've been SO happy being able to watch to my heart's delight! But alas ... it's leaving PRIME soon!  NOOOOOOooooooOOOOooO!!!

It's a great retelling of the Cinderella tale in musical style. It is romantic, and funny and warm and enchanting and whimsical. After languishing in obscurity, Amazon brought it to Prime, but it's only for Prime members, you can't rent or purchase it streaming or DVD. Last I checked, only some very expensive re-recorded PAL versions were being offered by third parties.

Can't you DO something? ... sigh ... all good things must come to an end ... but trust me. If you love musicals and Cinderella ... or just Richard Chamberlain, do yourself a favor and watch this. Fun for the whole family. (I've got to get my hands on a DVD.)

 of all things ruling class and governmental, one can draw an interesting and provocative line all the way to it's producer, David Frost, who the very next year would elicit a historic confession of wrongdoing from former US President Richard Nixon in his infamous interviews that
would be enshrined in the play and film ""Frost/Nixon"".

It is the classic story of Cinderella retold and extended to what happened happily ever after. The characters were fleshed out into real people with their own problems and dilemmas. You experience the emotions of the girl sent to the basement to become her stepmother and stepsister's slave after her father died, the frustration of a prince who doesn't want to be married to make an alliance for his kingdom, and the whimsy of a fairy godmother who can make everyone else's dreams come true but her own. Also thrown in is the sad tale of a servant who cannot marry his love because of ""position and positioning"", lots of other music and dance, and beautiful scenery and videography. I was especially happy to see the Blu-Ray had included commentary and bonus features about the Sherman Brothers.

Unfortunately what you get is a fairly pedestrian retelling of the Cinderella story, chocked full of unmemorable songs, whose sole purpose it seems is to push the film over the two hour mark.  If you want a musical Cinderella, go for the Lesley Ann Warren version.  I mean, who can compete with Rogers & Hammerstein?  If you want a prince filled with angst and subject to deep thoughts, go for The Glass Slipper.  With Leslie Caron, The Glass Slipper provides all the dancing you need.  If you're looking for a little more grit in the story, get Ever After.  Unfortunately, not even a spoonful of sugar can make this movie and it's musical numbers go down.

1342634,3,B00004RERO,"I loved seeing my old favorite and the quality of the DVD was wonderful.  I just have one gripe:  it arrived from Britain and when I tried to play it, a window popped up, telling me that I needed to change my playing setting from Region 1 to Region 2, the USA being 1 and Great Britain being 2.  That part wasn't so bad.  I was able to do it quickly, but it also told me that I would only be able to play it about 5 more times, and then it would be permanently locked so that I wouldn't ever be able to play it again.  This irritates me and I'm not sure how to solve it.  I don't like the idea of paying $15.00 to only be able to see the movie 6 times.",1438905600,,652,3.7573529411764706

Just as enjoyable now as it was when I was a kid, and possibly even more now because I really appreciate the biting humor. So much talent in front of and behind the camera, from the two gorgeous leads and the wonderful and witty Fairy Godmother all the way to the enthusiastic dancers and background extras -- middle-aged men in high heels hopping around on tables and benches! the servant in the blue shirt whose smile will not quit! that stunning ballroom scene! -- and an amazing production overall. My only complaint is that we have to view it in standard definition, not theatrical / letterbox format, but I assume that's out of Amazon's control.

1342663,5,B00004RERO,"Slipper and the Rose is the best version of classic Cinderella you will ever see. Wonderful scores by the Sherman brothers.  In this version of Cinderella you see the start of Cinderella life as a servant. You get to see what the prince's life is like and glimpses into the political life as well.  Before the ball is held Cinderella has already met her fairy godmother, though she doesn't know that's who she is yet,who has left her a dog to keep her company. So she isn't totally surprised when she shows up and then reveals who she is.  The interesting thing I think about this version is while mice are used for the transformation to horses, a frog is used for the coachman.  It's a very neat transition which involves ballet that they show a very slow transition of an animal jumping to a man jumping. The Cinderella goes to the ball and of course the prince and she fall in love but she must run.  What's different is when the prince finds her again, the king makes Cinderella go away in secret because he can't approve of the marriage since he needs someone to bring strength and monetary gain to the kingdom which a commoner can't do. So the prince loses her again and has to look for her what happens next I will let you find out but really there are some unforgettable scenes in the movie and wonderful choreography. I highly recommend it.",1435276800,,1349,4.445344129554656
1342664,5,B00004RERO,"I love this movie and have since I first saw it on TV back in the 80s. It was a terrible showing, but the movie transcended the static. I've been looking for it on DVD for the last few years and I was so excited to find this copy. The restoration was good. The picture is clear. I haven't listened to the commentary, but the movie itself is of great quality.

The reason I enjoy this retelling of Cinderella is because there's a lot more depth to the story while still maintaining the fairytale feel. There is a fairy godmother (who complains about how much work she has to do), a wicked stepmother and selfish stepsisters, leaving the ball before the stroke of midnight and magic. But at the same time, there's the king worrying about being attacked by outside forces (which is why it's so important for Edward to get married to a princess), Edward lamenting his position that restricts his desires, and his companion at arms explaining that this restriction actually exists at every level of society. And best of all, the happy ending is preserved. Richard Chamberlain is excellent as the Prince. Gemma Craven is a perfect Cinderella.

The songs are great fun. The Prince gets lectured by his parents about marriage with the song ""What Does Love Have to Do with Getting Married?"" Edward sings of his ancestors in ""What a Comforting Thing to Know"". After the ball, Cinderella and Edward sing alone their perceptions of the night with parallel versions of ""When He/She Danced with Me"". The king and his advisors plan for the ball with the extremely entertaining song ""Protocol"".

I can't recommend this movie enough. If you get the chance, watch it.",1435017600,4,1649,4.698961937716263
1342665,5,B00004RERO,"I have no idea how I missed this growing up. It is a wonderfully told Cinderella story, as much from the Prince's perspective as Cinderella's. Richard Chamberlain is exceptional as the Prince and Gemma Craven is a revelation. I grew up with the Rodgers & Hammerstein Cinderella musical which I like very much--especially the Julie Andrews and Whitney Houston versions. When I saw this was a musical, I just assumed it was another version of theirs and bought it because I'm a Faerie Tale collector. I was ecstatic when I received it and discovered it was a Sherman Brothers musical instead (creators of Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Happiest Millionaire, and a host of other classic Disney and Disneyish musicals). I'm surprised that R&H got all the glory because as much as I enjoy their Cinderella, I think the Sherman Brothers' Cinderella far outshines it. The funny songs are hilarious and the serious songs are absolutely gorgeous. One song during the climax of the film actually moved me to tears. I read that this Prince is the prince that Dougray Scott based his Prince Henry on for Ever After, and you can certainly see it. While I confess I was hoping for a little romance between the Prince and Cinderella before the pivotal ball scene, that hope was disappointed and the traditional love-at-first-sight route was taken; but even so, thanks to the songs which actually progress the story instead of stalling it, their love is still believable and shines like a light in a dark room. The sets and settings are lavish and beautiful, and the Fairy Godmother is by far my favorite Fairy Godmother ever seen or read. She's funny and delightful and actually has the most character development of any of the Fairy Godmothers I've seen. I won't spoil the story for those who haven't seen it, but I consider this a must-own for Cinderella fans, and I'd put it in the top 4 cinematic versions ever told, tied in 3rd place with Kenneth Branagh's new Cinderella, after Ever After and the iconic Disney animated version.",1435017600,3,2027,4.810888252148997

1342692,5,B00004RERO,"I first saw this version of the Cinderella tale in its American release at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, back when I didn't even have a VHS player, and I bought the soundtrack album (in an LP recording) mainly for two outstanding numbers in the Sherman Brothers score: ""Protocoligorically Correct"" and ""He/She Danced with Me."" I've long since given away my record player and records, and I hadn't seen or heard any part of this movie until I saw the musical numbers on You Tube and learned that American children had enjoyed watching THE SLIPPER AND THE ROSE on television. It was finally Disney's 2015 live action version of CINDERELLA that galvanized me into buying the Blu-Ray of THE SLIPPER AND THE ROSE.

The movie seems more entertaining and delightful to me now than it did in 1976, when movie musicals seemed to be a dying art form. Now I enjoy the Sherman Brothers' score as a whole; the British cast playing comical royalty, a stepmother you love to hate, and the most tartly amusing fairy godmother ever; Richard Chamberlain's and Gemma Craven's melodious voices; and the sheer visual beauty of location-shot settings and period detail. This British movie wasn't a hit in its initial American release, but I'm glad it has won enough American hearts to be available on DVD and Blu-Ray in this country.

The 1999 commentary by the director Bryan Forbes is one of the best commentaries I've heard accompanying films. His commentary stays focused on the film and conveys his fascinating insight on the making of the movie. The video quality of other special features reveal their ages of many years, but the movie itself looks clear and is truly a joy to watch.

THE SLIPPER AND THE ROSE is a live action fairy tale with a more realistic interpretation of the prince and the traditional impediments to his marrying outside royalty. It's fitting that the prince is played by an American, Richard Chamberlain, whose only slightly British accent suggests that if this story were not a fairy tale, he would elope with Cinderella and emigrate with her to the wild New World across the Atlantic! I recommend this movie not only for children, but also for adults who enjoy the art of movie musicals.",1431388800,,2209,4.777486910994765

1342721,1,B00004RERO,"I can't imagine who gave this movie all those 5-star ratings!  It was the loooongest movie I have every forced myself to watch, mostly because Richard Chamberlain was in it.  The music must have been written by one person because all the songs sounded the same.  And precious FEW were sung by the lead characters.  Mostly it was the old geezers singing and dancing around.....(there must have been one choreographer, too, for the same reason.)
and putting Richard Chamberlain and Cinderella in powdered wigs.......don't watch this one.  Although the Fairy Godmother was excellent (even the mice danced the same.....groan.  When a movie is free on prime, there's a reason.....",1428364800,,675,5.146788990825688
1342722,5,B00004RERO,"My favorite Cinderella movie by far! With wonderful music by the Sherman Brothers (Mary Poppins), you can't find more memorable and singable tunes. While not a perfect storyline, it is one of the most realistic rags-to-riches stories. The dancing is a blast and the acting is great! This movie is equally hilarious and heart-wrenching.

The opening credits were really drawn out, though the accompanying scenery and music was nice. The music was skillfully done, but the songs not memorable.

1342761,5,B00004RERO,"This is my favorite of all of the films I've seen about Cinderella, although I'm looking forward to the newest version directed by Kenneth Branaugh that is being released this month in theaters.  The songs in this film were crafted by the Sherman brothers, also known for their wonderful songs in Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and other classic movies.  I defy you to stop hearing Protocoligorically Correct in your head for weeks after watching the film.  The fairy godmother, played by Annette Crosbie, as an overworked, magic-borrowing fairy is priceless.  I first saw the movie on television where it had be re-edited to fit in the time slot, so it was a delight to discover scenes in the DVD version that had been cut for television.

As a kid I loved the dresses and the happy ending, now as as an adult, I found there was plenty of humor I missed when I was younger, and it wasn't the least bit boring.  One naughty word in the very first song, but otherwise, good clean fun for everyone.",1424390400,,480,4.042105263157895
1342784,4,B00004RERO,This is one of my favorite childhood movies! The songs are great and will keep you singing and dancing long after viewing. The only reason it doesn't get 5 is the effects are a bit cheesy (though probably ahead of their time for the late 70s). If you're a fan of the Sherman brothers' work you can't not like it. It goes a little deeper into the class system and gives the prince (a dashing Richard Chamberlain) a lot more storyline.,1424390400,,433,4.3580246913580245

perhaps actual Castle rooms) I think this marvelous film did not fully suceed with the public because, in an effort to make the
Best ""Cinderella"" film ever made- as if 'money' was no hinderance- for Cast and Sets- I would suspect they complicated the net results with HUMOR, very involved PLOT, exceptional musical routines, etc., as if to capture the regard of ADULTS AND PARENTS by means that unfortunately may be beyond the scope or interest of the CHILDREN that should be its Basic interntion.  (I happen to think the WALTZ scene when Cinderella and the Prince first meet, is worth the cost alone).

The two leads Gemma Craven and Richard Chamberlain try hard but do not enchant. The chief value of this Bryan Forbes directed over-long over produced stodge is the supporting cast which is led by a wonderful and beautiful Margaret Lockwood (out of retirement) as the evil stepmother, Edith Evans as the Dowager Queen (she died the year of the film's release, 1976), Kenneth More, Michael Hordern and, as the Fairy Godmother, a light and energetic Annette Crosbie.",1408233600,,567,5.173913043478261

written by the Sherman Brothers, I believe.  Good tunes and orchestrations.  Not as silly as one might think. This is due to
the wonderful cast of character actors...mostly British...faces one recognizes, but names that might not be remembered.
(Dame Edith Evans in a very funny role...Margaret Lockwood as the wicked stepmother).....There are some very funny scenes, some very funny dialog, and good musical numbers.  Great costumes.....good English locales (I think)...I liked it.  Found myself humming the tunes afterwards.  Richard Chamberlain does a good job as the put-upon Prince.  Gives the story of Cinderella
some class in a very fanciful manner.  Worth seeing!",1405987200,,807,5.392

Richard Chamberlain is flawless and the leading lady is lovely, but this does not help the pacing of the story.

1343027,4,B00004RERO,"Wow!
SO many visual details on this Blu-ray that I've never noticed before on my VHS or DVD editions. You can see EVERY stitch of embroidery on the costumes, even the light reflecting off the velvet coats and pants.

There are some very noticeable differences from the VHS or DVD editions, namely in the ""day for night"" scenes which never really looked right previously. (""He/She Danced With Me"" and a couple other short moments.) On this Blu-ray those scenes were saturated almost toooooooo blue, but I guess it does now look more like nighttime rather than just filming in midday (which is what the director mentions in the audio commentary).

Audio is okay, and that's why I rated this :4 stars instead of 5. I found myself needing to adjust the volume up or down every few minutes, especially when going into or out of songs. I don't remember the audio levels in the DVD being so uneven, so what happened here?",1396310400,3,914,4.635802469135802

1343090,5,B00004RERO,"This has been a long cherished musical of mine ever since I first saw it. My old dvd had too many scratches and skips and I've been disheartened for years that this movie has been out of publication and even on amazon, copies were selling for $80 or more. I was so excited to see this bluray release! Even for those who have enjoyed this movie before on dvd, it truly is a whole new experience watching in high definition. The beautiful English countryside, stunning glittering costumes, and ornamental detail come to life with every detail.

For those unfamiliar with this movie, it is your traditional Cinderella movie but with some twists. First it focuses more on the prince and the court. Prince Edward is fed up with court traditions and being forced into a marriage for political gain. Dialogue is witty and sometimes satirical. Cinderella is a bit more low keyed compared to the prince's character but has an innocent and fresh feel that charming. Effects are minimal but well used. The settings and costumes to me are the real magic of this movie.

And of course I would not love it quite so much if not for the songs. Some are sweet and haunting, but many are addicting and fun. For instance the Prince in the royal tombs singing ""Good kings... bad kings. Sane kings or mad kings, benevolent or nefarious... here is where they bury us! Oh ho ho What a comforting thing to know. There's a pre-arranged spot in the family plot where my royal bones will go ~ Yes, I'll be slipped into the beautiful family crypt. Oh ho ho What a comforting thing to know!"" Other of my favorites are the opening ""Why can't I be two people,"" ""Protocoligorically Correct,"" ""Position and positioning.""

This is a favorite of friends and family and highly recommend the blu-ray release!",1389571200,10,1771,4.651757188498403
1343091,4,B00004RERO,"Although the movie isn't quite how I remembered it from seeing it years ago on t.v., the movie is very good and has many songs in it from the Sherman brothers (Mary Poppins).  The scenery and castle where the movie was filmed are beautifully enchanting.  Who knew that Richard Chamberlain (the prince) could sing as well as act?!  The story is quite different from the traditional one (Disney) but has a happy ending.  If you like a lot of singing and dancing with beautiful scenery, you will enjoy this movie!",1389398400,4,510,4.633333333333334

1343104,5,B00004RERO,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it is very ingratiating to see from the other reviewers so far that we are all in agreement. In an age when so many films try their darnedest to be grim, violent, scatological  and ugly, it is refreshing to watch a film that strivesand succeedsto be just plain beautiful on ever level. The costumes are sumptuous, the sets (especially the location shots in Austria) and the actors are uniformly stunning (has anyone ever worn period clothes with as much panache as Richard Chamberlain?). More than that, the performances of everyone involved are subtle, witty and engaging, and the plot twist they introduce after the Prince has finally identified and located Cinderella is insightful and inventive. This is not just a film for kids; it is the most intelligent telling of the Cinderella story Ive ever seen. And the musical score is catchy to the point of almost being maddeningjust TRY to get some of those tunes out of your head. (Although some viewers might have wished for a few fewer songsthere are a lot of them. Fortunately, they are almost all musical gems.)

No, I haven't watched the Blu-ray that just came today. But I will watch in the next few days and edit this review. Based on the film's history I expect that I'll love it. But I want this review to be helpful ASAP for you please read on.

First you need to know that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL versions and formats for a title. So if you are trying to read reviews in 2013 click in the sorting button for ""Newest First"". THEN look at, not only the date of the review but which edition is being discussed. There are DVDs that are PAL (only play in Europe) and NTSC (for US) plus Bluray. I received the Bluray from Inception Home Video. It has a BLUE photo on cover (though Cinderella's dress is white). In order to find the new Bluray version (and order it) you will need to search for the title with the word ""Bluray"" in the search. or go here:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Slipper-and-the-Rose-The-Story-Of-Cinderella-Blu-ray/dp/B00ENP2R1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Slipper and the Rose: The Story Of Cinderella [Blu-ray</a>]

The 2013 edition was RESTORED in the UK by Pinewood Studios and that is the basis for the Inception release. The audio is 5.1 DTS-MA and uncompressed 24 bit 48 kHz stereo. The bonuses include a commentary by the late director Bryan Forbes recorded in 1999 There is also a ""making of"" featurette and a featurette on the Sherman Brothers who wrote the songs. Both of these are in standard def).

So, I'm really looking forward to watching it but, based other reviews the story and music should be great. Only now - in 2013 - there is a NEW HD restoration! Make sure the item you are buying is marked 2013 release from Inception.

As I said, I'll adjust review if needed but I wanted to be as helpful to buyers here as I can.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

1343121,5,B00004RERO,"A box-office disappointment upon its original release, the lovely David Frost production of THE SLIPPER AND THE ROSE has arrived on Blu-Ray from Inception Entertainment.

An extravagant musical adaptation of the Cinderella story by director Bryan Forbes and song-meisters Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman, who wrote a handful of tuneful compositions, ""The Slipper and the Rose"" was one of the last big-budget musicals of its kind produced for the screen. Gemma Craven makes for an endearing Cinderella while Richard Chamberlain struts his stuff as the Prince (in a sympathetic performance Dougray Scott would draw upon to a degree in ""Ever After"" years later), and many wonderful British vets appear in secondary roles, from Kenneth More to Edith Evans, Michael Hordern, Margaret Lockwood, and others. The film is overlong but beautifully shot by Tony Imi, whose widescreen compositions give the mostly set-bound dramatics some theatrical impact. The Shermans' songs run the gamut from bouncy to unnecessary, but between the good-natured performances and stripped-down fantasy elements (again, an aspect ""Ever After"" emulated some time later), this is one of the more memorable adaptations of the Cinderella story placed on-screen, with ample charm and elegance to spare.

Out of circulation for many years, ""The Slipper and the Rose"" made is way to DVD in the U.S. over a decade ago from Image Entertainment. That release contained the full-length British version of the movie (Universal trimmed some 15 minutes for its U.S. theatrical release) along with several special features. Inception's Blu-Ray marks the first release of the film on video domestically since that out-of-print release, and it's a beauty: the label's 1080p AVC encoded transfer is spectacular, marked by fine detail, natural grain and gorgeous colors. It's as impressive as any catalog release I've seen this year.

A number of audio options are included, from a 5.1 DTS MA mix to a LPCM 2.0 stereo track that's more limited in its stereophonic range, and an ""alternative"" 5.1 DTS MA mix that's not quite as bass-heavy as the other DTS MA mix. All the extras from the Image release have also been retained: audio commentary by director Bryan Forbes (particularly interesting as he discusses the film's production and bizarre financing), a 30-minute, vintage promotional documentary hosted by Frost (who executive-produced the film), and a 17-minute on-camera interview with the Sherman Brothers rounds out a terrific package all around. Highly recommended.",1383782400,45,2530,5.383838383838384

1343139,4,B00004RERO,"This was an impulse purchase for me, for which I spent an embarrassingly ridiculous amount of money since the official Region 1 DVD went out of print some time ago.  While a different pressing of the disc was given out as a freebie through the ""Daily Mail"" a few years ago, and numerous copies of that version can be found at a purchase price of only a couple of dollars on-line, the ""Daily Mail"" version has a monophonic soundtrack and has been cropped from the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio down to 1.78:1.  I wanted to see the film in its original form, and so decided to go for the official hard-to-find American DVD.

""The Slipper and the Rose"" is one of those films that is mostly forgotten today, but which has maintained a modest but very dedicated following throughout the years.  I gather this picture didn't do very well in America upon its original theatrical release, but it was a greater success in the UK.  (Plus in the US it suffered the indignity of being shortened by nearly twenty minutes, as compared to the UK cut.)

The story of Cinderella has been filmed so very many times that I was curious to see how this version could add anything fresh to the time-worn tale.  (It had been many years since I've seen it, and while I remembered I enjoyed it, I had almost no recollection of any of the songs, or the specifics of the plot.)  The hook here is that the story is explored from the viewpoint of the prince, rather than Cinderella herself, and this proves to be an inspired choice.  The latter part of the film set it apart from the many other versions as well.  Usually at the conclusion of these films we see that yep, the slipper fits---and then it's only a few moments until the end credits roll.  ""The Slipper and the Rose"" breaks with this tradition, in that there's another thirty minutes of story after the big revelation, which explore a few details of the logistics of the plot that I never really considered before.  So, that was refreshing.

Undoubtedly this is a lovely film to look at.  While it is set in a mythical country, the exteriors were shot in Austria near Salzburg, and the scenery is splendid.  And despite the mythical setting, it is placed in a specific time frame---circa 1785 or thereabouts---so the costumes and interiors  (which seem to be fairly accurate for the period) are amazingly opulent and lavish.

The casting is just about perfect all around.  Richard Chamberlain is a natural in the role of the prince.  Though in my youth I was familiar with his work from viewing productions such as ""The Thorn Birds"" and ""Shogun,""  I haven't seen him in anything for quite a few years.  And when watching this film, I was suddenly struck by how amazingly good-looking he was in his prime---RIDICULOUSLY handsome, even.  Plus, he has a very fine singing voice.  I really do believe that if he had been born twenty years earlier, he could have been a big star in musical pictures during Hollywood's golden age....  Gemma Craven is a lovely Cinderella---she also has a very fine singing voice---though perhaps she's a bit colourless and subdued in the role.  However, I don't really think of this as a negative in this particular production, since the story does focus more on the prince's life than on Cinderella's....  And Annette Crosbie is a lot of fun as the fairy godmother, with her tart observations and asides addressed to her canine companion.  The supporting cast members are all good as well.

The primary drawback of the film, I'm afraid, is the musical score.  About half of the songs are rather bland and forgettable.  For the most part they serve their function admirably, in advancing the plot without the need for additional exposition.  But at the same time they do tend to make the film drag a bit; in my opinion many of the songs in this score simply do not compare to those written by Rodgers and Hammerstein for their own musical version of ""Cinderella,"" which had been produced about twenty years before this picture was made.  On the other hand, I did think that several songs in ""The Slipper and the Rose"" were excellent---most of the songs I liked were in the second half of the film.  (My favourites include ""He Danced With Me,"" ""Suddenly It Happens,"" and ""Secret Kingdom."")  Though---I do confess a fondness for ""What a Comforting Thing to Know"" early in the film, where the prince and his best friend do an acrobatic song-and-dance in the royal tomb while musing about their eventual fate in life.

While I'm quite happy to have the longer 143-minute cut of the film on DVD, at the same time I can understand why it was shortened for the US release---I do think it runs a bit slow and is overlong.  The first hour drags; I realise that it's necessary to set up the circumstances of the prince's life, so the audience can get a feel for his situation and state of mind.  But at the same time I think there's a need to move things along at a swifter pace.  And as I ran the film a second time I was imagining just what could be trimmed---perhaps I'm a frustrated film editor at heart!  I think some footage could have been ""sweated out"" in tiny bits and pieces throughout the picture without making huge cuts, though one song I most definitely would have deleted was ""Protocoligorically Correct."" It's a catchy tune, but is a completely unnecessary addition to the plot and it brings the film to a screeching halt.  I also would have trimmed (if not cut entirely) the scenes immediately following, which were about sending out the invitations to the ball.  Those two changes alone would have trimmed about eight minutes from the running time.  I'm also wondering if  ""Position and Positioning""  should have been shortened.  I personally liked the big song-and-dance in the kitchen (which brought to mind the ""Be Our Guest"" number from Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"").  But was it necessary for the film?  Also, I thought that number very oddly looked like it was missing about five or ten dancers; seemed like there should have been more of them there, on that big set.

Favourite bits?  Plenty!  But in particular I thought both of Cinderella's exits from the castle, in less than ideal circumstances, were quite nicely done---very dramatically in the first instance, and rather hauntingly in the second.

So, a slightly mixed review from me on this film----but a most enthusiastic mixed review, if that makes any sense.  They really don't make films like this anymore---this was one of the last lavish original musicals (as compared to an adaptation of an existing show) written for the big screen.  I'm sure I'll be watching this picture again--- I've run it several times already, since getting a copy.  And despite the fact that I thought the music in many cases was NOT all that memorable, there were several songs I enjoyed so much that I think I'm going to pick up a copy of the soundtrack.

The print of the film on the official Region 1 DVD is relatively clean and sharp---not restored in any way, but it looks decent enough apart from a little dust and dirt, and some damage at the very end of the last reel.  There is a bit of a problem with the sound, however, in that the musical numbers are noticeably louder than the dialogue portions.  I was wondering if this was a problem with the settings on my audio system, but the trouble was just as noticeable when listening to the audio on headphones.  Still, there's nice stereo separation across the front three speakers of a multi-channel set-up, though there's little or no activity on the surrounds.

Extras include a 30-minute ""making of"" documentary that ran on UK television at the time of the film's original release, an audio commentary by the director, and an interview with the Sherman brothers, who talked about working on the script and writing the songs.",1328227200,2,7803,4.661549707602339
1343140,5,B00004RERO,"With this tuneful 1976 repackaging of  the tale of Cinderella, viewers are rewarded with a meticulously created world of an 18th century European Kingdom that is like a photographic version of a Rococco painting, but bathed in soft white light, courtesy of cinematographer, Tony Imi.
 The setting is more than faintly reminiscent of that other notable 18th century  version of ""Cinderella"", ""The Glass Slipper"" (1955) starring Leslie Caron.
 Whereas Caron's Cinderella was a tempermental and highly disagreeable outcaste, Gemma Craven's Cinderella is soft, a bit firm, but not expressing too much open hostility when her newly widowed stepmother(Margaret Lockwood), having dismissed all the household servants, makes her the sole servant of the household while indulging her own daughters, Palatine and Isobella(Sherrie Hewson and Rosalind Ayres).
 Meanwhile, over at the palace, Edward, the Prince of Euphrania( a handsome charismatic Richard Chamberlin) expresses displeasure with life in his guilded cage, as he bitterly confronts his father, the King ( Sir Michael Hordern)about a recently rejected candidate for an arranged marriage. He enjoys the company of of his companion, John (Christopher Gable), who is attracted to a lady-in-waiting named Caroline(Polly Williams, bearing a strong resemblance to Britain's Princess Anne), a woman above him in rank. In due time, the Prince will ease the way for the couple to be together, while still pining for true romance of his own.
 As the paths of the Prince and his beloved-to-be slowly begin to diverge, we are treated to a lively number with Edward and John cavorting in the Royal Crypt, while outside the palace, the orphaned Cinderlla places flowers on the rod-iron-cross-topped graves of her parents, over which tall grasses softly wave, as she reminds herself that once she was loved, to keep up her morale.
 As the decison from the palace to have a royal bride-finding ball is handed down, Julian Orchard's foppish Rupert, the Duke of Montague is the comic relief who is desperate for a bride, and will eventually help bring the story to a favorable conclusion.
 As Cinderella continues with her relentless round of daily tasks amid the ingratitude of her stepfamily, a mysterious woman(Annette Crosbie) wanders into her life, complete with a small four-legged companion. The young girl suddenly finds her tasks to be much easier, and eventually,  she arranges for Cinderella to attend the ball as Princess Incognita.
 As is well known, Cinderella and the Prince meet,but the young girl forgets to leave before the stroke of midnight. The Prince is angry at his Chamberlain (Sir Kenneth More) when he mistakenly believes he frightened Cinderella away as they were in the garden together. But a lost glass slipper is soon put on display for all citizens to see after an unsuccessful attempt to find the shoe's owner by having every eligible maiden in the Kingdom try it on yields no results.
 When the bride-to-be is eventually found, the discovery that the Prince must make a betrothal to a foreign-born Princess to seal an alliance and protect the small country from a possible war, results in Cinderella's being sent away--an odd take on the traditional story.
 In a scene based on Frangonard's painting ""Happy Accidents on the Swing"", The Fairy Godmother confronts her charge once more, goading her back into battle and expressing her dismay about her disobedience (""...All the same, you young girls.--Never do as you're told! Men are much easier!"").
 Gradually, we get our fairytale ending amid the lavish scenery.
 Lally Bowers as the Queen, the incomparable Dame Edith Evans as the Dowager Queen, round out the delightful cast who graciously bow and curtsey to their invisible audience at the end. I recall thinking this to have been one of the strangest productions of the Cinderella story I had ever seen upon my first viewing of it in the early 80s. But it has since grown on me considerably. Besides, in which other version of the tale can we enjoy a scene of statesmen and their King singing about protocol while marching atop a table?
  And so, speaking The King's Euphranian, I will say that thirty-five years after its release, ""The Slipper and the Rose"" still holds the power to entrance!",1324512000,,4263,5.12987012987013

Nice job also to the prince and Cinderella, they both have great voices and they really outdid themselves in this one. The king is absolutely hilarious! The fairy godmother is an unexpected one, too. The lady dowager queen was a nice touch as well...she keeps us laughing with her confused looks, and out-of-place comments.

The best I can say about this is that it's mediocre. The music is pretty forgettable, despite the Oscar win. I actually remember watching the Oscars that night being at a lost as to why this film won.

The costumes are beautiful, the acting so-so. But on a whole it is bloated and overhyped.

Even the Leslie Ann Warren Disney TV version is better.

1343147,2,B00004RERO,"I liked the 5-star, musicals ""Maytime"", ""Naughty Marietta"", and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"". There was more life in the low-budget, 3-star, musical, ""Rumpelstiltskin"" with Amy Irving.

This film has lots of songs, but none make you want to sing along. There are a few pleasant songs that are relaxing. There are also songs by other actors, such as the king, who are not singers, and have no business singing. There is some pleasant humor by the fairy-godmother, but her deadpan humor is not exploited, because Cinderella has no reactions. The attempts at humor by the king and his Court earlier-on fall flat, and so by the time you get to the better humor by the fairy-godmother; you are jaded. The huge interior of the castle is too sparsely furnished giving a cold and lonely feeling. The king looks to be on a meager budget. They should have used a smaller set that was packed with interest. The dialogue is very formal and without personality. The dancing looks staged rather than fun. The producer lacked imagination, romance, a good sense of humor, intrigue, drama, and excitement. Not a character actor in the lot. Feels more like a play than a movie. A good Cinderella movie has yet to be made. Women may be able to imagine this better than it is. This may be a chick-flick that I just cannot relate to. Available on DVD at Brazilian-Cinema dot comm for $20 plus $4 shipping.",1254700800,2,1381,4.683127572016461
1343148,5,B00004RERO,"The first version I saw starred Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon. Not being a viewer of soap operas, I never saw him before this movie filmed as a play, but I did know of Celeste Holmes who played the fairy godmother. I think my favorite number was watching Warren pantomining the various people she pretended to be while in her little corner. Then I saw Brandy take on the role and loved Jason Alexander singing about the ball, though I didn't care much for Whoopi's characterization as Prince Charming's mother. Then came The Slipper and the Rose and I finally felt as if I had seen a movie that knew how to tell the story of the improbable romance between a prince seeking to marry for love rather than position, and a servant girl who could only dream of going to a ball. The music, scenery, costumes, the fabulous Austrian countryside were magnificent. I of coure knew Richard Chamberlian, though mostly from his role as Dr. Kildare, and Kenneth More, though I can't recall from where. Most of the cast members were unknown to me, but I was not disappointed with a single one. One scene I look forward to is the transformation scene, especially watching the white mice raise their arms over their heads, then lower them to become horses. Watching the frog jumping and taking on the look of a person, then becoming one, was fun. Those glass slippers sure looked a lot more interesting than those Warren wore. In the beginning, Prince Edward was wishing he could be two people so one half could marry the woman of his choice. Further into the movie, we hear his servant wishing he could marry Caorline, but not able to because of her station, which was echoed in the number Position and Positioning. Then Edward knights John and tells him he can marry the Lady Caroline. After Lord Chamberlain tells Cinderella she cannot marry the prince because it would not be in the best interests of the kingdom, we wonder how that will be changed, since we do know he will marry her. A lot of twists and turns, ups and downs, but plenty of good (to me) musical numbers to enjoy. I loved the closing credits where we see the performers' names (including the dog, Fred) so we know who played whom. I had no trouble with the length of the movie, and never get tired of watching it.",1249171200,3,2272,4.530413625304136
1343149,3,B00004RERO,"I was eager to see this movie after hearing quite a bit about it, but after watching it, I felt a bit let down. It's hard to explain why. The costumes are gorgeous, the scenery is too beautiful for words, and the story is a well-known classic which is well suited to this kind of treatment.

My problem lies with the musical portion, a main focal point in ""The Slipper"". The DVD case lauds the musical writers -- indeed, they're well known for several of their other musicals, but this is not one of their hits. I'm not comparing the songs to modern musicals, either. Take a look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1776-Restored-Director-s-Cut/dp/B000067D1R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1776  (Restored Director's Cut)</a>, made a few years before ""The Slipper"", and you'll see immediately what I mean. 1776 is chock full of songs that practically leach onto you -- you'll be humming them all day long. The songs in ""The Slipper"" just don't stick to one's mind. I often felt the tempos were very repetitive. Not to mention quite a few waltz-themed songs, which felt out of place in a 1700s setting. They weren't horrible -- several songs were pleasant to listen to and the cast did an admirable singing job, but not once did I feel like I needed to buy the soundtrack or listen to that song again.

Worse yet were the dancing sequences. The mausoleum sequence is odd: considering the Prince and his friend are grown men you don't think they would be leaping around on tombs and swinging from poles like monkeys. The second sequence was centered around the servants, but the portion was boring me so much that I fast-forwarded through the leaping maids and pirouetting butlers. It felt very stagey, and several times through the movie I thought that I might be having a better experience if I was watching this on Broadway. One part that I think was done very well was the Fairy Godmother's transformation of the animals into Cinderella's carriage. The mouse dancers were cute and the frog guy -- boy could he jump like a frog!

Overall, it's worth a view and little girls will fall in love with it. Costume drama fans might enjoy putting this one on while doing something else. But don't expect any musical magic.",1246320000,3,2254,4.908136482939632

1343157,5,B00004RERO,"I saw this movie in the movie theater when I was 10 years old. For years I looked for it to be on TV and have always considered it my favorite movie, even though none of my friends had ever seen it. When my now husband and I were dating we were talking favorite movies. He asked me what my favorite was and I told him it was one nobody had ever seen and did not tell him. I then asked him what his favorite movie was. He said it was also one nobody had ever seen and was called ""The Slipper and the Rose"". I knew then we were meant to be together! Twenty-four years later it is still the favorite movie for both of us.

I bought the DVD and CD when it finally became available. Love the story, love the music, love the actors. Not your usual Cinderella story because of the twist at the end.

This movie is good, but I would think that unless you have fun memories tied to it, it would be too ""outdated"" to suddenly watch it and love it right now in the 2000s, unless you happen to love older musical movies from the 70s and 80s.

The music is amazing (by the Sherman Brothers, who also wrote ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang""). The story is so detailed and realistic for those times and full of humor and subtle irony. Everytime I watch that movie I find another detail that makes me smile - it is definitely not only for children, but also for adults with a big heart. It was produced with a love to detail. The costumes and the scenery are truly magical and splendid. There are no words to really describe the beauty of them. The dancing scenes are wonderfully choreographed and danced. I would not change one single actor - they all are so unique and could not have been chosen better: I love the slightly confused King, the wicked but stylish Stepmother, the loveable Fairy Godmother and of course Richard Chamberlain as the charming Prince and Gemma Craven as the beautiful and touching Cinderella. I can unconditionally recommend that movie. I have seen most Cinderella movies (old and new, musical and fairy tale, ballet versions etc.) and this is my most favorite!

1343176,5,B00004RERO,"This is a truly enchanting musical version of the Cinderella story. I first watched this as a young girl and I've recently watched the DVD a number of times. I was amazed that even though over 10 years have passed I remembered most of the story, including song lyrics and dialogue...obviously it made a big impression on me the first time around! Watching the film as an adult is a real treat. There is a lavish quality to every aspect - from the beautiful costumes to the stunning landscape and gauzy cinematography. It makes me laugh and it makes me cry and, by the end, I'm cheering!

The Slipper and The Rose is the kind of film that appeals to adults as well as children. There are many funny jokes and clever songs that are great to sing along to. Of course, and most importantly in my opinion, the film is also incredibly romantic. I can't think of two better actors to play Cinderella and the Prince than Gemma Craven and Richard Chamberlain. Gemma is lovely and kind and Richard is dashing, thoughtful and oozes masculinity - quite a feat when he is wearing high heals and ribbons! In many ways, this is quite a grown-up version of Cinderella. The chracters are fully fleshed out rather than being the usual stereotypes, there are a couple of unexpected twists in the plot, and the film is also slower paced and has longer songs than the typical contemporary musical film. In short, it demands more attention and is more subtle than many of today's family entertainment films.

There are also loads of great secondary characters. The Prince's assistant John and his forbidden love Lady Caroline, the put upon Fairy Godfather (played marvellously by Annette Crosbie - best known in Britain as Victor Meldrew's wife in One Foot in the Grave), and a perfectly ghastly Stepmother and Stepsisters. The funniest characters are probably Montague (who is incredibly pompous and outlandish) and the elderly Dowager Queen (who has poor hearing and misunderstands everything because of it).

The film fleshes out the character of the Prince in a very enjoyable way. Normally, the Prince is a fairly generic handsome type who rides around on his horse and doesn't do much else. In this version though, we really get to know what he's thinking and feeling. He is determined to marry for love and no other reason, despite strong opposition from his parents and the royal household. Knowing about his troubles, as well as those of Cinderella, make you root for them both all the more.

If it isn't obvious by now, I really recommend this film to people who are looking for something romantic and old-fashioned. It is the perfect film to watch when you need a lift. I have so many favourite scenes - when the Prince and John sing `What a comforting thing to know' in the royal crypt, when Cinderella and the Prince meet at the ball and sing `Secret Kingdom', when the Prince rides up on his horse as Cinderella is dancing in the field and when the couple are reunited at the church.

I probably own at least a dozen different Cinderella movies, and this has to be one of the weakest.

Cinderella herself is a total weakling.  She is entirely passive.  Everything happens to her - she really doesn't take an active roll.  She lets her stepmother take everything away from her. She lets herself be bossed by the stepsisters.  She lets herself be talked out of marrying the prince.  This Cinderella NEVER stands up for herself.

The music drags and is often inappropriate.  There's a whole song and dance number in a mausoleum - the prince and his man at arms dance around the crypts of dead kings.

The only good point in this is Richard Chamberlain.  The one star is for him.

Save your money - buy A Tale of Cinderella or Ever After instead - better music, and the Cinderella characters don't just let themselves get pushed around.",1186704000,4,911,4.521472392638037

There is more of a back story to the Prince and a new dilemma keeping him and Cinderella apart.  The stepmother and stepsisters are divine.  They nailed the parts.

1343208,5,B00004RERO,"""The Slipper And The Rose"" is a beautiful version of the classic Cinderella story. Made in England and released in 1976, it retells the familiar story with warmth, humor and wonderful songs by the Sherman brothers, who also did the music for countless Disney films, notably ""Mary Poppins"". Prince Edward (Richard Chamberlain), heir to the throne of Euphrania, is expected by his father the king (Michael Hordern) and his mother the queen (Lally Bowers) to choose a wife and settle down. To this end, they plan a court ball to which all the princesses they can locate will be invited. Meanwhile, young Cinderella (Gemma Craven) has just lost her beloved father. But things go from bad to worse for her, when her selfish stepmother (Margaret Lockwood) and spoiled stepsisters (Rosalind Ayres and Sherrie Hewson) reduce her to the status of a servant in her own home. Thankfully, however, her fairy godmother (Annette Crosbie) is waiting in the wings to see that she goes to the ball and meet the prince. The rest is up to them... With an excellent cast and fine support from Kenneth More, as the Lord Chamberlain, Christopher Gable as the prince's friend John, and especially Dame Edith Evans as the dowager Queen, ""The Slipper and the Rose"" is magical film-making.a few twists in the story keep it fresh, while all the charm of the original is preserved. The lavish production, handsome location photography and a witty, sophisticated script has appeal for all ages. One of the best film versions of ""Cinderella"" ever made.

1343210,5,B00004RERO,"Wow, I first saw this on Disney years back but they never showed the same edited version twice so I wanted to get the full uncut version.  Wonderful!  This is a great telling of Cinderella (still not a Brothers Grimm's story but more enchanting without all the gore).  The music is hummable, the dancing fantastic (and thankfully not over the top), and the acting great.  Chamberlain is, of course, wonderful and Gemma Craven has a wonderful film debut as the sweet and unassuming princess of the night with the beautiful voice.  A must have for any musical collector or period film afficionado.  And you will be happy to know that even though this movie came out in the 70s there is still content on the DVD worth watching--the making of is particularly interesting.",1127088000,8,767,4.7293233082706765

The characters are likeable, except the step-mother and step-sisters, of course, and even step-mom is glad for Cinderella at the end.  The song that the King sings in the library about being politically correct and the song that Richard Chamberlain, the Prince, and his Companion at Arms sing in the mausoleum are gems.  In my opinion, this is the best Cinderella story.",1127088000,3,429,5.0

1343226,5,B00004RERO,"I spent many an afternoon as a young girl making the 'at ready' escape into the world of a hundred different stories.  The story of Cinderella was particularly appealing. I spent many hours seeing myself as the small ""unfortunate"" overworked and desperately underappreciated.  Watching (and listening!) to The Slipper and the Rose, I found myself a willing member of a cast I didn't even audition for! You will be whisked away (and want to stay there) by the costumes, the music (the practical prince and trusty attendee sing a rousing song--What A Comforting Thing to Know!--and dance to it as well within the walls of a family crypt!!!  It seems an unlikely place for a smashing song--but, WOW!) and the acting.  I found myself enjoying the music and dancing so much that I activated the closed captioning to enable me to see the words so that I would be able to join them!  (My favorite to join in on: Protocoligorically Correct.)  My next dime will be going towards the musical's soundtrack!  I highly recommend adding this musical wonder to any library.",1126224000,3,1058,4.8121546961325965
1343227,4,B00004RERO,"If you are not a fan of musicals, this one is not going to change your mind.  But if you can tolerate them at times, or even really enjoy the genre, then you should find much to like about the Slipper and the Rose.  It portrays the classic Cinderella tale from the perspective of the Prince, who is determined to marry for love, not for the political advantages his father the King is seeking from his only son's marriage.

  The castles and scenery, filmed primarily in Austria are beautiful, as are the magnificent costumes.  The Sherman Brothers music is marvelous--at times catchy and whimsical, at other times filled with touches of melancholy. The large ensemble cast is first rate, headed by Richard Chamberlain as the Prince, and Gemma Craven, in her film debut, as Cinderella.

  Having watched this musical several times, I found I appreciated the delightful touches of wit more with each viewing, particularly from the clueless King, played by Michael Horden,and from his nephew Montague, played most amusingly by Julian Orchard.  The Fairy Godmother is truly an original, and one of the many highlights, along with her little dog.

  This was Richard Chamberlain's first musical, but watching him, you would never know it--he inhabits the role of Prince Edward with his usual grace and poise, and the period costumes look, as always, stunning on him.  His velvety singing voice, as well as the smooth, flowing way he dances the waltz with Cinderella, may come as a surprise to those who only remember him from his years of portraying Dr. James Kildare.

 The only drawback to an otherwise top-rate production is the length--at 2 hours and 24 minutes, I think this film is a tad too long.  But this is a minor complaint.........I continue to derive great pleasure from this most unique, creative take on the tale of Cinderella.",1119139200,4,1838,4.877419354838709
1343228,4,B00004RERO,"The Slipper and the Rose is a musical version of Cinderella and stars Richard Chamberlain as the Prince who is being forced into choosing a bride but who yearns to find love. Gemma Craven is Cinderella, young and beautiful but forced into drudgery by her `wicked stepmother' (Margaret Lockwood).  Other well known faces are Kenneth More as the Lord Chamberlain, Michael Horden as the King, Annette Crosby as the feisty fairy godmother and Dame Edith Evans as the dowager queen.
The story closely follows the fairy story so beloved by generations of children but with the inclusion of numerous songs which, while not being works of musical genius, are very catchy nonetheless and find you tapping your foot alongside them. Costumes are sumptuous and the scenery (shot in Austria) is magnificent. Although this film is almost 30 years old it should still entertain children (and young-at-heart adults) as much now as it did then.
The main flaw with this DVD, and the reason it lost a star, is its poor transfer from film. There has been no effort made to clean up the picture or sound, so it looks a little faded and grainy, and the sound is not as clear as it could be. There are no extras whatsoever (Region 2), not even subtitles or scene select. In other words, if you already own this movie on VHS then the DVD really isn't worth purchasing but, if you don't already possess it, then it is worth buying purely for the entertainment value.",1118880000,3,1441,4.695652173913044
1343229,5,B00004RERO,"I was treated to this film when it was first released in the US in 1977.  I immediately dragged everyone I could think of to see it.

This rendition of the classic tale can entrance young and old alike.  The fairy tale is there, with the handsome prince (Richard Chamberlain at his best!) and the downtrodden Cinderella (Gemma Craven in the role of a lifetime) being assisted by the most ""down-to-earth"" fairy godmother(perfectly portrayed by acclaimed actress Annette Crosbie of ""One Foot in the Grave""), and complete with lush scenery, exquisite costumes, and songs by the same team who did ""Mary Poppins.""  (The Sherman brothers did get an Academy Award Nomination for ""He Danced With Me/She Danced with Me"" from the film.)

But wait. There's more.  We have a plot twist, fleshed out characters of the queen, the king, and the court, plus an attendant-at-arms in the person of Royal Ballet star-turned-actor Christopher Gable.  The whole story has wit, and bite, and a fullness of character.  The musical numbers are beautifully staged and acrobatic enough to be reminiscent of Gene Kelly's work.  Chamberlain's singing was a known factor, and his dancing work was good enough to match Gable's.  (Of course, Chamberlain has been stage-fighting trained for swordwork and such.)

If you think you saw this on the Disney Channel, you saw MOST of it.  I saw it in the theater and saw ALMOST ALL of it.  The DVD version now available has IT ALL.  Not seen in US theatres: the number ""Find a Mate"" which included the great Dame Edith Evans singing!  Then there's the song Gemma Craven sings while in exile. [Note:  the soundtrack, which was released when the film ran in the theater, does not include either of those numbers.] Also new to US audiences: a glimpse into the life of Annette Crosbie's fairy godmother, and what she has to deal with.

It's a lavish production, the last of the original musicals, and truly enjoyable.  DVD extras include a behind the scenes look at the production as well as a look at the inception of the project.  Considering the film will soon be 30 years old, and hadn't been readily available for years, this is wonderful.",1106784000,11,2152,4.798913043478261
1343230,5,B00004RERO,"I love this movie, absolutely and positively.  Can't remember how I stumbled on it.

1343231,2,B00004RERO,"After winning an autographed copy several years ago, I had to wait a long time to unite this DVD with a DVD player.  I have always enjoyed the Sherman Brothers' work, from Mary Poppins to 1776, even the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room.  I was also looking forward to finally watching Michael Hordern onscreen, after falling in love with his voice in the BBC's radio version of The Lord of the Rings (he was a spectacular Gandalf).  Now, after all that buildup, what a tremendous letdown.  I'm about 40 minutes in and bored out of my skull.  The jokes are flat, the lyrics monosyllabic and predictable, the melodies are entirely forgettable, and the acting is entirely two-dimensional.
Not recommended for anyone over the age of 5.",1076976000,4,728,4.700787401574803
1343232,4,B00004RERO,"I remember seeing this when I was young, but couldn't remember the name of it.  I was delighted when I found it again.

The leads are wonderful, particularly Richard Chamberlain, a very kind and thoughtful prince. As a veteran actor, you can almost see what he is thinking. Veteran, indeed; though 40 when he played this role, he is believable as young prince Edward. Actually getting to know the prince (who is onscreen at least as much as Cinderella) is one of the things that make this retelling of the tale superior and adds to the richness of the story.

Gemma Craven's Cinderella is lovable rather than ""parroting"" goodness, managing to stay just this side of sappy.  You believe in Cinderella as a noble being, one willing to sacrifice her own happiness for her people while trying to minimize the pain this will cause the prince. You can't help being delighted for her when things turn out right in the end.

The ensemble work is good as well. The showstopping song and dance of ""Position and Positioning"" is particularly fine, bringing back memories of ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" on the rooftop in ""Mary Poppins,"" also the work of the Sherman brothers. A few songs, like ""Proticoligorically Correct,"" do drag things down a bit, but the rest of the film more than makes up for it.

The best performance by far, though, is that of Annette Crosby as the Fairy Godmother.  Bypassing sugary-sweet, Ms. Crosby's performance is delightfully tart and very funny.  As a bonus, the reason for the ""leave before the stroke of midnight"" stricture is at last explained.

Even the actors without lines add to the fun. The facial expressions of the Queen mother of ""the other bride"" in the scene where her husband and the King of Euphrania discuss their problem children make me laugh every time I see it.

For fans of the Cinderella myth, this is a good version to choose.",1076457600,20,1860,4.712962962962963
1343233,5,B00004RERO,I bought this after reading some of the reviews.  I have always been a fan of Cinderella.  This is a great movie.  The songs are wonderful and the fairy godmother is the best.  If you like magic and music you'll love this.,1076198400,4,222,4.214285714285714

Richard  makes a vulnerable and intelligent, very lovable prince charming.  And as for Gemma Craven, she's the perfect Cinderella, no woman will ever be able to compare.  She beautiful and demure.  Her voice is like delicate crystal.  She commands the screen with her quiet grace, and her smile is so genuine can can't help but adore her.  And adore her I did.",1074816000,4,653,4.863636363636363

The sound doesn't match the Actors mouths......it was only slightly off to begin with so I was able to ignore it.  But it kept getting worse.  I recommend getting the video version instead.

Here, the Sherman Brothers (writers of ""Mary Poppins"") have brought this classic story to a whole new level.  The richness of this tale is unsurpassed.  In spite of its being fairly cheesy (hardly surprising in a fairy tale, after all) it is also wonderfully charming.  The story is expanded excellently, and this new release of it includes never-before-seen footage as well.  The added footage was wonderful, I was so upset that they had actually left it OUT!  There are even two new songs that were not in the original release, and a couple of other songs are expanded.
The music is breathtaking and sometimes downright haunting (as in the case of ""Tell Him Anything"" or ""I Can't Forget the Melody""), the cinematography is gorgeous, and the costumes are simply unbelievable!  I wanted to be in that movie if only for the sake of those scrumptious costumes!  ;-)

Everyone I have forced to watch The Slipper and the Rose has been an instant convert...grown women, children - BIG hit with gay men due to liberal use of big frocks, silly wigs and camp acting by at least half the cast...

I especially liked the novelty songs of ""What a Conforting Thing To Know"" and ""Protocoligorically Correct"" And the voices of Richard Chamberlain and Gemma Craven are wonderful.
The ball was especially colorful with the rainbow of colors in the ball gowns and there has never been a more beautiful Cinderella or a more handsome Prince Charming.  Need I say more?

1343264,5,B00004RERO,"I love this movie.  But why is it in the kid's movie section?  The humor in it is not really for kids.

It's refreshing to have the Cinderella story told from the prince's point of view.  Handsome, young Richard Chamberlain in the lead certainly didn't hurt.  Is it me or do anyone of you viewers see how the young Gemma Craven resembles Alicia Silverstone?

Another thing that's great about this movie is the music, especially the lyrics.  Sherman brothers were funny as hell to pen the lyrics.

Over all, the music, cast, production design all went tightly with the story line.

Disney's one of the few musical filmakers who does short songs because they are marketing their films for kids.

She injects a great sense of humor into the movie as a godmother who complains about being overworked.  Margaret Lockwood is a delightful wicked stepmother.

This wonderful movie can be  summed up in one word: Enchanting!",961113600,13,775,4.67910447761194
1343294,5,B00004RERO,"I found this movie one day on the Disney Channel while flipping throug the channels.  I only saw the last hour or so, but I was enthralled.  I have looked for it for 2 years.  Then I discovered it's finally on video.  I  bought it at once, naturally. This is the most romantic version of the  famous tale that I've ever seen.  Richard Chamberlain does an outstanding  performance as the prince.  He's handsome, charming and witty.  I'm  surprised more of the princesses didn't agree to come to the bride finding  ball. Gemma Cravens is the perfect Cinderella: beautiful, sweet, and kind.  A princess in her manner and character. Edward and Cinderella are the  perfect couple.  Their love is touching.  And I like all the twists and  turns in the story that leave you wondering if maybe the prince won't marry  his beloved Cinderella.  But of course he does, but the two go through a  lot.  They have their problems and separations.  It's not all roses for  them.  Though this is a fairy tale, it doesn't seem like it.  It's all very  believable.  And very well done.  It didn't lack anything at all. It's just  a wonderful, romantic tale, and a joy to watch.  Love really does find a  way!",960163200,13,1189,4.545454545454546
1343295,5,B00004RERO,I am so excited that this is available that I felt I have to share it. Richard Chamberlain in this film was my first love as a child of 8 or 9. This led to the inevitable love of him as Father Ralph Debricassar (sp?) in  The Thorn Birds...such a star in the old fashioned way. Now that I have a  daughter of my own I am so thrilled to be able to show her The Slipper and  the Rose...although she's only 7 months old so it could be a stretch at  this stage!,958608000,,456,3.8191489361702127
1343296,5,B00004RERO,"After waiting for years for the release of this film on tape, it has finally happened and was worth waiting for. It is a delightful, tunefull version of the Cinderella story. With the exception of Richard Chamberlain  as the Prince, all the actors are British and wonderful in their roles.  Gemma Cravan is a complete delight as Cinderella. She is a major musical  star in London and it is easy to see why from this performance. Normally  the version shown on American TV is about 125 minutes long, this tape is  the full 143 minute version. The songs by the Sherman Brothers, who wrote a  number of Disney musicals including ""Mary Poppins"" are wonderful.  Anyone looking for a really good entertainment should check out this  production.",957484800,4,738,4.801587301587301
1343297,5,B00004RERO,"Although The Slipper and The Rose appeared long after the heyday of big-budget musical films, it has that same glossy gorgeousness, ripe with scene-chewing performances, wonderful melodies and sumptuous production  values.  Richard Chamberlain and Gemma Craven are delightful in this  creative take on the Cinderella story, which of course never goes out of  date.  This film is absolutely perfect family entertainment, and given its  disappearance in the market for so many years, it will be a surprise hit  for children everywhere.  The timelessness of the story and the  expensive-looking sets and costumes make it a true classic.  The Sherman  Brothers, who provided endless joy in so many Disney films with their  catchy, theatrical songs deliver the goods again here. I remember being  completely enchanted by this film in the theatre, and I hope one day it can  be seen in full-screen glory again.",956966400,6,904,5.230769230769231
1343300,5,B00004RERO,when we first got a video player back in the early eighties this was one of the first films we wanted to get but could never find. I am looking forward to watching it again. The wonderful songs are still fresh in my  mind even though I haven't seen it since its theater days! It is the perfect  classic farytale romance for young and old alike!,956880000,2,344,4.196969696969697
1343301,5,B00004RERO,"Finally!  I remember the first time I saw this grand musical.  Many people have been trying to find it for years and now it's here.  From the magical ""Suddenly"" to the tragic ""Tell Him"", this is one for  anyone who loves musicals or the story of Cinderella.  I don't know what it  is about the Sherman brothers, but I love all of their music.  Many people  don't know it, but besides Mary Poppins & The Jungle Book, I believe  they wrote the music for Lansbury's Bedknobs & Broomsticks - another  great musical that was basically a failure at its initial release, like  S&R; but has found a huge fan club!",956707200,2,605,4.409090909090909
1343302,5,B00004RERO,"my aunt taped this movie and watched it something like fifty times until the picture got really fuzzy. then i borrowed it from her and watched it about another fifty times, and the tape is about to fall apart. i tried to find a copy of it online, but i kept typing ""The Rose and the  Slipper"" so i never got any results.  i finally saw it on tv the other  day (strange coincidence) and made myself remember the exact title.  and i  found it!  as sappy movies go, this is one of the best i've seen. the  movie is romantic and funny at the same time, and no matter how many times  you watch it you find yourself catching things you didn't catch before. i  thought the king was one of the funniest characters, but i loved the fairy  godmother best of all. and instead of making cinderella a complete  goody-goody, like the fairytale paints her, gemma craven portrays her in a  way that's easier to identify with. (yes, she _hates_ her stepmother.)  meanwhile, instead of having the prince be some silent minor character,  (think the disney movie. did he say...one line?)  they focus a lot of the  story on him. watch this movie!",956361600,5,1125,4.414634146341464
1343303,5,B00004RERO,"This is one of those rare movies you'll want to rewind and watch again and again.  An absolutely beautiful film filled with unforgettably beautiful songs, wonderfully funny and delightful characters and... well, there are  no words good enough to praise it, it's a must have, a movie you should  see, and once seen you'll want to see it again and again.  I have no idea  how often I've watched this movie but each time I do it always has the same  effect on me, even when I watch it twice the same day and now it's being  released on DVD and I'll finally be able to see it in widescreen ...  wonderful.  DON'T PASS THIS ONE BY, It's worth every cent.",955238400,4,650,4.305785123966942
1343304,4,B00004RERO,I've been hoping to see this movie released for years.  This is the movie I went to see at the movie theater instead of Star Wars. I made a good choice. The music is great and the characters are what makes this movie a  must have.  I don't know how they managed to make a movie this funny and  romantic too.,954979200,4,307,3.9836065573770494
1343305,5,B00004RERO,"I, like most viewers, saw this years ago, and it has been in my heart ever since!  I am so thrilled that it is finally being released and others  will become acquainted with, what I consider, the greatest Cinderella story  ever!  The casting is absolutely superb, Richard Chamberlain and Gemma  Craven are the epitome of this famous prince and his leading lady! Equally  enjoyable is the fairy godmother, whose character is like icing on the  cake! The story is very romantic, but also very believable, as each  character deals with the demands of protocol. The scenery and musical score  speak for themselves! Absolutely superb! I've been singing the songs for  years! (""Once I Was Loved"", ""Rainbows Raced Around The  Room,"" and ""The Family Crypt song,"" which is hilarious, are  favorites!)  Buy this movie today! It's one you don't want to miss!",954979200,10,847,4.921985815602837

1343307,5,B00004RERO,"A lovely adaptation of one of our favorite fairy tales.  Good cast, a pleasant version, nice scenery.  Richard Chamberlain is the noble prince thirsting to find love.  (I especially like the plot twist in regard to his  friend John. Despite the prince's personal pain of loss, he is generous and  helps John.)  Gemma Craven is a perky Cinderella.  But watch for Annette  Crosbie as the Fairy Godmother.  A wonderful performance!  My own personal  ""Best fairy godmother ever"" award goes to Annette Crosbie!",953942400,2,505,5.036585365853658

I am so glad I will be able to own a copy of this beautiful musical telling of the classic Cinderella story ...a perfect  family film! I especially love the beautiful costumes and the music!

I had no idea I would be able to get it as a DVD!  Great! This film has enchanted me from the first time I saw it back in the  early eighties. It is the most charming version of the Cinderella tale that  is out there. You'll find yourself humming the tunes because you can't help  yourself!
