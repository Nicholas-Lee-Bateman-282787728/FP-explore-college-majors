This is for those that have already created good endurance in the sport and want to take their jump rope abilities and skills to the next level. If you are just starting out, or can jump for less than 10 minutes, do not get near this video (yet) as you will find this too extreme. As in other reviewers' post, the video presents advance movements in slow motion which makes them easy to see (not easy to perform though) they way it is done.

An awesome and entertaining for those that like the sport. 5 stars all the way...",1328832000,,542,4.356435643564357

I buy many workout dvds and this was the worst one I have ever seen.",1260748800,,103,3.9523809523809526
8066107,5,B0009SCV6Y,"No industry secret left unturned in this DVD. Every move I've seen experts do is displayed in super slow motion with instructions narrated for better understanding. This is NOT a workout DVD, but a demonstration/instructional DVD instead. This is where you learn more ""show off"" moves that will give you boredom free workouts and a way to impress on lookers, and of course burn some serious calories.

Every move is not for everybody but there are some moves for everybody, you just have to find those that are tailored made for you. I highly recommend you collect all 4 DVDs, from beginners to extreme or pick up from whatever level you are.

You cannot get the rope from the ropesport website. I guess they no longer sell their own product, but the videos are everywhere including AMAZON.COM where I purchased all of mines.

I honestly enjoy this type of workout that has stood the test of time for many boxers and other elite athletes, even though they don't jump at this level. This extreme lesson will allow you to set a goal to learn various moves that will burn calories just from practicing.",1246233600,4,1099,4.683937823834197
