8754718,5,B01D2995F6,No one is who they appear to be; all have an agenda. Remade 1945 by Fritz Lang as Scarlet Street. Renoir places more emphasis on character.,1517788800,,139,4.384615384615385

8754720,3,B01D2995F6,"A sorry state of affairs these people put themselves in.  I found the story mostly frustrating, though the characters are brought to life very well by all the actors.",1488585600,,166,4.724137931034483

8754723,5,B01D2995F6,"La Chienne is the original of Scarlet Street which I had always liked better until I saw this new Criterion release.  I don't even miss Robinson, Bennett, and Duryea.  This movie is that good!",1470268800,6,192,4.617647058823529
8754724,4,B01D2995F6,"I'm a fan of Renoir, the actor Michel Simon and 1930's French films so this was right up my alley.  A nerdy older man with a shrewish wife falls for a prostitute who only has eyes for her pimp. It ends badly. Hollywood's remake with Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett called Scarlett Street does not end badly as was typical for Hollywood. This original version is a lot better. The bad get punished and the victim too but not in the Hollywood way.",1469664000,5,449,4.345238095238095
8754725,5,B01D2995F6,"Excellent Criterion package. LA CHIENNE is one of Renoir's masterpieces, a tale of obsession and lust told with touches of great humor. It also comes with ON PURGE BEBE, Renoir's first sound feature, a slightly stagey farce. LA CHIENNE has been restored with great care and is probably the best this film has looked in decades! Certainly a great showcase for Renoir's talent, showing remarkable fluidity in terms of camerawork and marvellous invention in the use of sound.",1469232000,6,472,5.064102564102564
8754726,4,B01D2995F6,"This 1931 Renoir movie, made four years after the arrival of the first talking picture, is a very realistic analysis of some aspects of Montmartre way of living, with it's crude dialogue, lightened only by Renoir's naturalistic poetry. Michel Simon gives in this film (and in ""L'Atalante"") one of his top performances as the constantly humiliated husband who goes painting to support his mistress who exploits him.
""La Chienne"" comes with the 1936 short ""Une partie de campagne"" , a masterpiece of French freshness which reminds us that Jean Renoir is also the son of the impressionist painter Auguste Renoir.
One complaint about this bonus film: dialogue is almost inaudible due to sound parasites.",1021075200,32,699,5.140350877192983
