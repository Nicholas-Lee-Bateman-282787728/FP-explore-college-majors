2294170,1,B0009J93V4,I thought this movie was worthless... I remember first seeing it about 15 years ago because of all the hype behind it. After searching and searching I found myself a copy and paid a ridiculous amount for it. The plot and the idea behind the movie is way better than the actual movie itself. I was excited to get it but truly disappointed to see it. Personal opinion... If you haven't seen it; save your money and let your imagination run wild with what it could have been... Otherwise you will be soarly disappointed.,1293321600,11,517,4.51063829787234
2294171,5,B0009J93V4,"First of all, yes this movie is as sick and twisted as youve heard,especially the end,which i belive has to be seen to be belived. This movie is so much more then just a horror movie like another reveiew said,its a look at the mind of a man gone mad. Pushed over the edge after his girlfriend left him for a corpse he can only then find the ultimate sexual fulfilment at the sharp edge of a knife. This a movie that is worth the hefty price you will pay as it will probably never be released on dvd again (god bless the fine folks at Barrel Entertainment,too bad they went belly up). By all means should no one under 18 see this movie. It is grusome, repulsive but in a strange way also beautiful and captivating, one of my all time favorite movie.",1289001600,3,748,4.201388888888889
2294172,5,B0009J93V4,"Before viewing this film you will need to prepare yourself for: Animal abuse, necrophilia, corpse cunnilingus, decomposing body parts and a very dark and deranged love story!!! If that's your thing you will surely enjoy this masterpiece. The SFX are hit and miss, but know doubt enough to get the point across, overall very, very twisted. The sound track is great and the picture quality sets the grim mood of the film, almost enough to make you feel dirty! Nekromantik is classic shock gore that divulged subject matter that horror/cult writers of that time era were either too disgusted by or too terrified by and not to mention the death threats and possible repercussions of completing a film this explicit. This film paved a new pathway to the obscene and perverse and the ultimate taboo-- NECROPHILIA!!! A great film and story, definitely worth the hefty price tag and absolutely essential to any real horror collection!",1276646400,6,926,4.980645161290322
2294173,4,B0009J93V4,"NEKROMANTIK is every parent's worst nightmare. It is the film they have built up in their minds to represent the Horror genre at large. However, genre fans will be surprised to find that the film is just as much a character study into the darkest recesses of the human psyche as it is a repulsive shocker. The action finds a man who is growing increasingly jealous as his wife begins to prefer making love with the festering corpse that he has brought home from work for their necrophilic escapades. After she leaves him for the corpse, he is left to wallow in despair as he spirals deeper in to his own psychosis and even more deplorable acts. Every scene of NEKROMANTIK is intentionally shot to shock and disgust, including unnecessary shots of urination, animal slaughter, and a range of perversions that are often irrelevant to the plot. The visceral gore goes far beyond anything that has been seen in the past, inducing vomit in even the hardened Horror fans through the use of real animal intestines and a sickening finale. The 8mm filming combined with the unnerving score and grotesqueries on screen culminate into a gritty and voyeuristic experience. Buttgereit makes bold statements concerning desensitization through media exposure, but he does so by using even more extreme sensationalism and gore than that which occurs in the films he is commenting against. Despite the purely exploitative plot and lurid themes, NEKROMANTIK is competently acted and directed in order to achieve maximum effect. The fact that it is not poorly made makes the film that much more powerful and dangerous, since it cannot be easily dismissed or disregarded as callow and unsophisticated garbage. This same form of subversive cinema would carry in to Buttgereit's subsequent films, and would also serve as a significant influence on later shockers found in the AUGUST UNDERGROUND series and more recently the equally necrophilic DEADGIRL. While certainly not for all audiences, NEKROMANTIK has a notorious reputation that is well deserved, making it an important (if not distasteful) entry in the genre.

2294174,5,B0009J93V4,"Never in the history of cinema has a director tackled such controversial subject matter, as that of necrophilia, and attempted to portray it in such a beautifully erotic way.
German cult director Jorg Buttgereit has done just that with his film Nekromantik. His film tells the story of two deeply depraved individuals, Rob and his girlfriend Betty, who are obsessed with collecting human body parts, which they keep on display in formaldehyde sealed jars throughout their apartment. Rob works for a roadside accident cleaning company and is responsible for bagging the dead bodies of car wreak victims, which gives him the perfect opportunity to add to his collection. Not content with body parts alone, Rob surprises Betty by bringing home a bloated corpse. Betty is overjoyed and the couple decide to introduce the corpse into their sex life. All is good, but as time goes on Betty becomes enamored with the corpse. She leaves Rob and takes the corpse for her own sexual pleasures. Unable to cope with his loss, Rob travels a twisted road of sickness and self-abuse before finally finding salvation in this one of a kind movie ending you have to see to believe.
This film is not for the faint-of-heart, and is extremely graphic in depicting scenes of gore and necrophilia. However, if you are a fan of exploitation films this is a must see. This is the definitive DVD release of this film and it's loaded with extras, you will not be disappointed.",1216771200,56,1449,4.846774193548387
2294175,5,B0009J93V4,"Made on a tight budget and an 8mm camera Jorg Buttgeriet (the king of extreme horror) has made the most dark, filthy, disgusting, appalling, obscene, gross, vile, hideous, atrocious, crude, offensive, shocking, outrageous, and vulgar movie to have ever been made. Jorg Buttgereit show's veiwers just how disgusting life can be and pull's no punches in regard's to offensive content, most people do not like to see or think about these thing's............... but they do exist and this is a film about it.

In summary it is a story about a guy who find's a slimy, rotting dead corpse in the swamp and fall's in love with it (it is a pretty hot corpse, I do admit) He decides to take it home to his deranged girlfriend so they can carry out there twisted/perverse sexual fantasy's. So when he get's the corpse home him and his girlfreind replace his/it's ""member"" with a chair leg and the fun begin's. As appalling as that sound's it's actually pulled off in a very classy way (did I just say that?). Soon the wife decide's she is more interested in their dead freind and decide's to leave him, and she take's the corpse with her (bummer). The guy cannot live without his rotting lover, fall's into a deep depression, and what follow's is the most disgusting climax (no pun intened) ever put to celluloid. I don't want to spoil anything but I think it is one of the coolest, outrageous ending's ever and has to be seen to believed.

Gore and offensive subject matter includes (but is not limited to)- Necrophelia, a scene of a rabbit being gutted, more necrophelia, a surgical disembowelment scene, gore, suicide, nudity, a cat being slammed against the wall, more gore, rape, and more necrophelia.

If you enjoy such film's as Cannibal Holocaust, Men Behing the Sun, Cannibal Ferox, Isla She Wolf of the SS, Flower of Flesh and Blood, Street Trash, The Untold Story, Visitor Q, or New York Ripper, and haven't seen Nekromantik then you need to pick this one up...........NOW!",1193097600,,1974,4.732558139534884
2294176,4,B0009J93V4,"I actually watched this on DVD from Netflix last night.  Why did I rate this film 4 stars?  The acting isn't that good.  The cinematography isn't that good.  The plot isn't that good.  The pacing isn't that good.  In fact the film just isn't that good, but what it did do was what I wanted it to do and that was gross me out completely.  It's been a long time since I was that disgusted watching something, and that's a good thing.  I'm a huge fan of horror films so I like to be grossed out and scared.  While this film didn't scare me it almost made me look away.  This would rank right up there with watching The Thing and An American Werewolf in London when I was a child and then again watching Cannibal Ferox (Make Them Die Slowly) when I was a teenager.  So I give this film 4 stars for the plain fact that is lived up to it's potential and made me sick to my stomach.  Excellent!",1156982400,56,887,4.093023255813954

2294183,3,B0009J93V4,"This film somehow slipped under my radar until recently. I was pretty intrigued when I read about certain scenes in the movie, so I had to check it out for myself. And all I can say is that I wasn't disappointed. This movie does have its disturbing or ""messed up"" moments.  However, this is a very cheaply made film. The production value is poor,  the acting isn't great, and most of the special effects are sub-par (expect for a scene that uses real footage that involves the death of a rabbit). But because of its bare bones style production, it somewhat adds to the film's effectiveness. The tight camera shots, and the dirtiness and grittiness of it, make it feel a bit more real. However, some of the effects (or lack thereof) hurt the film. For example, the ""climatic"" scene at the end is indeed shocking, but because of the really cheap and fake looking effects, it does take a lot of the sting out, sort of speak. Another positive for the film is the soundtrack. For the most part, it has some really good pieces of music, especially a beautiful piano piece that's juxtaposed with the necrophilia scene. Overall, I think this is a pretty good film for what its worth. Again, its not about it's production, but rather the lack thereof. However, this is one film I would really love to see remade. To be able to keep the grim atmosphere and the tight camerawork, but add much better special effects and acting. I would like to see the story be expanded and the two main characters, (especially Rob) to be re-written and add more layers to them. Sort of like with the Maniac remake. In fact, this film does remind me of that film is some ways. But even with its flaws, again, I think its a pretty decent film. And if these types of films are your thing, I don't think you'll be too disappointed with it.",1432684800,,1808,4.459214501510574

2294186,4,B0009J93V4,"This is one of those movies that every horror fan run into sooner or later. It have such a reputation and just reading the synopsis makes you wonder what sick filth you are about to watch. But you will watch it. Sooner or later curiousity will win you over and ""Nekromantik"" will stand proudly right there, right in the middle of your collection.

When Cult Epics released both ""Nekromantik"" and the hillariously undertitled sequel; Return of the Loving Dead, on luxurious limited edition blu-ray discs I was defeated. I could no longer hold back my curiosity for this macabre shockfest and the inevitable finally happened. Both films are now in my possesion.

I have still not watched the second one but ""Nekromantik"" I had the honor to watch some days ago. How was it then? Well, first of I want to say that both the Blu-ray discs feel and look great. Cult Epics have given all you curious movie fans an offer you simply should not refuse. If you are going to get these films now is a great time to do so.

The movie itself was pretty much exactly what I had expected. Maybe it had lost some of its punch thou through out the years. Maybe the internet generation will not be as easily shocked as the elders who watched this stuff way back. But this is deffinitely still not anything to suggest on a date. For doing so would probably scare any sort of new found love far, far, far away.

The movie is in most parts so cheap, weird and bad that when the really effective stuff make an appearence you are taken kind of off guard by it.

The sexier scenes is something you probably never will forget.

But I did enjoy this movie. The acting was bad and the overall feel was so insanely cheap but the pure guerilla style movie making and determination to make a movie make this shocker a pretty fun watch. You can tell that there were so much movie making passion involved in making this movie that you simply must look past its many flaws. ""Nekromantik"" is in a way like ""Clerks"" but for the exploitation crowd. This movie makes you want to make a movie and I love that. Thats why I will recommend this movie to everyone who can handle the dark content. ""Nekromantik"" is a great movie!",1427500800,2,2183,4.43142144638404

The movie is about 2 kooks Rob and Betty who are into bizarre things like human organs, bathing in blood, and having sex with a corpse. I do have to say the decay corpse looks good, but not good enough to save this movie. Then Betty decide to run off with the corpse leaving Rob to have sick fantasies about death. What's more shocking is not the movie. but that it got a blu ray release!

2294196,3,B0009J93V4,"The title of this review is tongue in cheek, but there's more than an element of truth here.  This isn't your standard-fare '80s B-movie.  The dual subjects of sex and necrophilia are as exploitation-friendly as they come, but this film comes across as more arthouse than grindhouse.

With that said, the film is not for the faint of heart.  In fact, at times, it's downright disgusting.  The budget here was so small that the special effects are all practical, and the props are often real animal parts and blood.  The onscreen slaughter and skinning of a pet rabbit is an important plot point, but it also caused two members of our film group to immediately tap out and leave the room.  The camera lingers on entrails and corpses, and the protagonist's final scene... well, it's unforgettable.  I'm assuming that if you're willing to put a film with this cover into your Blu-ray player, you're a member of a self-selecting tribe who's willing to take a bit of punishment.

The opening scene might be the worst in the film (the opening shot is a woman urinating), but if you can hold out for a bit, you're going to be treated to some lovely shots and surprisingly poignant music.  The director does an excellent job of manipulating the audience -- at times he wallows in the sex, violence, and filth.  At other times, particularly during the first scenes featuring the beautiful Beatrice Manowski, when he is downright restrained.  This will never be a five-star film -- the acting and the visual/sound design are too sub-par.  But if you're looking for something trashy, this is some of the classiest and most unique trash out there.",1421107200,,1635,4.75531914893617
2294197,5,B0009J93V4,"This is a movie about, as the title indicates, the love to the dead. A sort of perverted theme. And yes, it is a film with a lot of gore and a lot of disgusting dead meat. The weird thing about this movie is, that all this nastiness is filmed in a beautiful way  with beautiful music. This makes this film unusual and definitely needs an open mind to be watched. I personally liked the cheap synth-music the best. It suited the bad quality of the movie (which was filmed with a hi8 camera) perfectly. Combined this created a great and unusual atmosphere.

I rate Nekromantik as highly as I do because while it's obviously out to shock it also manages to be quite an effective character study. I'm sure many detractors of the movie will point to the minimalistic script (by director Jorg Buttgereit and Franz Rodenkirchen), the lack of any genuinely great acting and the varying quality of the special effects but I think that the film is powerful enough to rise above these things and still pack a hell of a punch.

I Give This Film My Highest possible recommendation! And I mean that. This stands as one of the most original films in the horror genre and one film that cannot be remade. Sure, the production value could be improved upon, but you'd never get the feeling you get from this one.",1419811200,,1293,4.470338983050848

2294209,4,B0009J93V4,"NEKROMANTIK is probably one of the most controversial and yet sought after films ever released.  This German shocker quickly gained notoriety around the world because of its gruesome subject matter, and it has been banned in several places.  Because of its reputation, I knew it was a film I had to see.  The fine folks at Cult Epics recently released the film on Blu-ray, and I had the privilege to check it out.  My reaction?  WOWshocking, disturbing, but yet very well done, artistic and full of merit.  If you can handle the subject matter, this is one film every horror fan should definitely own!!

I guess I should insert a warning here:  many people will find this film offensive and off-limits.  The subject matter is obviously taboo and will probably make some viewers recoil in revulsion.  But the film does not glamorize necrophilia or anything of the sort; on the contrary, it shows how such a thing can destroy a person.

NEKROMANTIK is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The Blu-ray version contains two versions of the film:  the new directors approved HD transfer, taken from the original Super 8mm negative, and the new Grindhouse HD version, taken from the theatrical 35 mm print.  Regardless of which one you watch, youll be impressed by both.

The film contains some excellent gore, too.  Aside from the corpse, we get to see several scenes of carnage, including a car accident that leaves a woman cut in half, a real rabbit that is killed and skinned, and even a man who has the top half of his head severed in two!  Gore-hounds will be happy here for sure!

If you do get the chance to give NEKROMANTIK a look, you should definitely watch it on Blu-ray.  Aside from the HD transfer for great picture and sound, youll get four hours of extras, including:

  * New Directors approved HD transfer (taken from the original Super 8mm negative)
  * New Grindhouse HD version (taken from the Theatrical 35mm print)
  * Introduction by Jorg Buttgereit (2013)
  * Q&A with Jorg Buttgereit at the American Cinematheque (2013)
  * Never Before released short film Hot Love (1985) in HD
  * Hot Love Audio Commentary & Featurette
  * Audio Commentary by Jorg Buttgereit and co-author Franz Rodenkirchen
  * The Making of Nekromantik
  * Nekromantik Featurette
  * Still Photo Gallery
  * JB Trailers
  * Original Motion Picture Soundtrack

The first 10,000 Blu-ray copies also include original collectible artwork by Johnny Ryan and a special Nekro photo of Beatrice M.

NEKROMANTIK will certainly not be for everyone, but its a big win for me, and I recommend it if you can stomach the subject matter.  I was happy to discover I can still be shocked, even after everything Ive seen onscreen, and this film certainly surprised me.  It is available now.",1414540800,3,2764,4.780851063829787

Sure there could have been more extras but with a film that hasn't had an official DVD release in America since the late 90s it's hard to complain. As for the film itself, its gruesome, disturbing, gross, beautiful, cheesy, funny and taboo breaking horror film made for pure exploitation fun!",1413936000,,400,4.897058823529412
2294213,4,B0009J93V4,"A young man named Rob uses his job where he collects and disposes of corpses to help build his growing collection of body parts. Not satisfied with just collecting mere body parts, one day he brings home an intact corpse. Rob in not alone in his obsession for the dead, his girlfriend Betty is also a necrophiliac. Unfortunately there moment of bliss would be short lived and Robs world will be turned inside out when Betty decides to leave him for the corpse he recently brought home. Unable to cope with this great loss he seeks out new avenues in hope that he will be able to fill the void that now dominates his life.

Todays audiences are constantly bombarded with violent imagery in films and in the news, which has led to a desensitization towards violence. And though it appears that each new film appears to be trying to outdo the last one when it comes to pushing the limits in regards to its depiction of violence. There are always going to be those films that are beyond the fringe that would shock even the most jaded cinema file. Case in point, Nekromantik a film that is just a potent today as the moment it was unleashed on audiences twenty six years ago.

On subject matter alone, there are very few films that are going to push buttons more than Nekromatik, a film that features a protagonist who obsession with necrophilia is bound to revolt the majority of perspective viewers. And if this were this films only objective, then it would have already faded away into obscurity.

Fortunately this film is not your run of mill shock and awe gore feast. And at the core of this film is story about love and death and how these two things are intertwined. Other subjects that this film explores include obsession and dealing with a loss of a loved one.

With that being said, this is the type of film that is bound to divide perspective viewers. It is a film that defies all genre conventions and more importantly it is a rare example of film capturing the true essence of horror. And though things that go bump in the night are bound to make most jolt, this film takes you to place where even the darkest of dreams are an afterthought compared to the events which unfold in this film.

From a production stand point there is a rawness to the visuals that add a level of authenticity to them. With the two scenes involving the corpse being fondled and the films brutal final being this films most memorable moments visually. And when it comes to moments of gore or bloodshed the films delivers in spades. The one area of this film that is most surprising is how well it incorporates humor into such a morbid tale.

Performance this are more than adequate as the majority of the characters within this film are mere props to further the story along. Thankfully the strongest performances come from this films two leads, Bernd Daktari Lorenz in the role of Robert and Beatrice Manowski (Wings of Desire) in the role of Betty. Both actors totally immerse themselves into the performances.

Since the beginning of cinema filmmakers have been forced to create within a confined area that far too often dilutes their vision. Thankfully not all filmmakers are content to just toe the line and that is why films like Nekromantik exists. Ultimately Nekromantik is a truly unique cinema experience that is best summed up as cinema without boundaries.

The BluRay:

Nekromantik comes on a 50 GB dual layer BluRay. This release has been flagged for progressive playback and the film is presented in its intended 1.33:1 aspect ratio. This film has been given a brand new HD transfer sourced from the original negatives and the end result is easily the best this film has looked to date on home video. The film was shot on 8mm and there are many limitations to this format. Outside of few darker moments colors look very good, details generally look crisp and there are no issues with compression.

This release comes with two audio options, a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix in German and a Dolby Digital Stereo mix in German. Both audio mixes sounds, clean, clear and balanced throughout. Range wise the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix in German sounds more robust of these two audio mixes. Also included with this release are removable English subtitles.

Extras for this release include, two postcards, a extensive stills gallery and trailers for Nekromantik (2 minutes 1 second  1.33:1 aspect ratio 1080 Progressive), Der Todesking (2 minutes 21 seconds  1.33:1 aspect ratio 1080 Progressive), Nekromantik 2 (1 minute 5 seconds  1.33:1 aspect ratio 1080 Progressive), Schramm (1 minute 31 seconds  1.33:1 aspect ratio 1080 Progressive) and Hot Love (1 minute 10 seconds  1.33:1 aspect ratio 1080 Progressive).

Other extras include, a Q & A with co-screenwriter / director Jrg Buttgereit (39 minutes 56 seconds  1080 Progressive Widescreen), a short film also directed by Buttgereit titled Hot Love (29 minutes 5 seconds  1.33:1 aspect ratio 1080 Progressive, in German with English subtitles), a featurette titled The Making of Nekromantik (12 minutes 24 seconds  1.33:1 aspect ratio 1080 Progressive), an interview with Buttgereit and producer Manfred O. Jelinski (9 minutes 23 seconds  1.33:1 aspect ratio 1080 Progressive) and a Making of segment for Hot Love (3 minutes 27 seconds  1.33:1 aspect ratio 1080 Progressive).

Topics discussed in the Q & A include the difficulties faced making Nekromantik, issues with censorship, the origins of the film, the films distribution history, how the two Nekromantik films represent the city of Berlin which at the time the first film was made it was divided by the Berlin wall, the films score, how the majority of shots had to be achieved in one take including the gruesome finale, his thoughts on the Japanese version which altered many shots with mosaic, Pink Flamingos and John Waters influence on the way he approaches cinema and he also talks about his other films. The The Making of Nekromantik featurette is a collection of onset footage, stills and outtakes, that have comments from Jrg Buttgereit and Franz Rodenkirchen who discuss the origins of the film, true crime books and their influence on this film, depiction of violence in horror cinema and the special effects. Topics discussed in the interview with Buttgereit and producer Manfred O. Jelinski include constructing the corpse used in the film, raising the money need to make this film, the script, finding an actress to fulfill this films unique requirements, how the two leads in this film did not get along, how a the film was confiscated before a theatrical showing in Norway, the various home video releases this film has received around the world and censorship that it faced in a few countries. The Making of segment for Hot Love is essentially footage of those who have just seen the film and their thoughts on what they have just seen.

Rounding out the extras is an option to listen to the films soundtrack, a Grindhouse version of the film that was sourced from a 35mm print (71 minutes 9 seconds  1.33:1 aspect ratio 1080 Progressive, in German with English subtitles). Quality wise the Grindhouse versions transfer is not in as good of shape as the other transfer included as part of this release. And though it has more print debris, it does give fans of this film an option to see this film the way most viewers saw during its original theatrical release. And an audio commentary with Jrg Buttgereit and screenwriter Franz Rodenkirchen, who discuss locations, special effects, the cast, the score, how they wanted to create a film that would not look dated, the difficulties on shooting on a limited budget and shooting over a prolonged period of time, the look of the film and why there are so many close-ups in this film and their thoughts on key sequences. Overall Nekromantik gets an exceptional release from Cult Epics, highly recommended.

Note: This release is a limited edition of 10000 Blu-rays and 2000 2 Disc DVDs.

2294215,5,B0009J93V4,Disturbing masterpiece of a film. I was shown this at a party and it left a permanent impression on me. I was glad to see it make it to bluray and it viewed much better than the VHS version I had seen 18 years prior It is not for the faint of heart. I give this film a 8 out of 10.,1413417600,,281,3.5483870967741935
2294216,3,B0009J93V4,"PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW UNLESS YOU ARE OVER THE AGE OF 21, AND OR HAVE A LIGHT CONSTITUTION- I GET GRAPHIC...ALSO SPOILER ALERT, First I want to state that I have not watched this particular Blue-ray, but I have seen this movie on other formats (such as on DVD).
The overall purpose of this film was to show the life style of people who enjoy having physical relations with corpses. There was one scene in which a woman and a man had a corpse in their bed (the woman used a poll as a substitute for a man's....uh?....you know what). The scene involved sucking and loving the dead person up...and when I say dead, I mean dead. And it's not a, ""just died"" kinda dead. No, we're talking rotting in the earth for several years looking dead!. At first, I thought the corpse was real. This particular scene is what made this film so popular...and in fact, this film had been banned in several countries after its initial release.
What I had written above is why you would buy this film...and for no other reason. The overall story in un-interesting, bad acting, and other then the corpse, bad special effects. There is, however, a scene in which a man kills a real rabbit, and you actually watch the life drain from it. Personally, I don't have to watch this movie more then once. However, if YOU want to feel grossed out then buy this film. Don't buy it for the scare factor, because it's just not there. If you like movies with a lot of gore you should also try ""Cannibal""- related to the real life incident of one man ki--ing and eat-ng his partner. The end of ""Cannibal"" is about 20 minutes of gross graphicness. Another gross film is ""Nekromantik part two"" (yes, they made a part two!). In the second one, it's pretty much the same story..however, in that one I believe (I'm trying to remember-watched years ago) they kill a real seal/cut open a dead seal????? or some larger animal.  Another movie you might like for grossness (though it is very campy) is ""Dead Alive"".",1408665600,26,1976,4.488888888888889
2294217,1,B0009J93V4,I was so glad I was able to use someone else's copy so I didn't have to buy it. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

2294222,1,B0009J93V4,"In a nutshell, this film was make to revolt the viewer.  There is no deep meaning or underlying message.  It is a pile of slime with licking popped-out rotten dead eyeballs.  There is also animal violence in this film.  The film maker takes a cute little rabbit and has it murdered so he can make buck.  The murder of the animal is not a special effect. He kills the animal in the most inhumane way possible, making sure the viewer can see the pain and suffering of this innocent living creature.  Then he skins the rabbit's body making sure to get in close for all to see.  Is this art? The director is so proud of killing the rabbit that he shows the skinned carcass over and over again throughout the film.

Here is a movie that can be used to get rid of unwanted guests.  Just show it and people will think the host is a perverted creep who enjoys sickness.  This piece of crapola can be found on other Internet cites for about $20.00.  It it total garbage.  It stinks in more ways one can even imagine.  Any film that needs to kill animals to get a rise out of its audience should be relegated to the trash can.",1367712000,65,1116,4.232227488151659
2294223,3,B0009J93V4,"NEKROMANTIK is, without a doubt, one of the most nauseating horror films ever made. The budget is small, but the over-all effect is ultra-real.
You will notice outrageous prices for this DVD.
These people who are selling this movie for $80-$120 just don't want you to own a copy of this film.
They've been sitting on this title for years.
Just type-in the title and use the search engine for small, but honest stores selling this for under $20.
This is a great, but sick film, but it's not worth the prices these rips are selling it for...BEWARE!",1326585600,14,546,4.581632653061225

Its really very atmospheric in its sick way.

Another director tried to make a necrophilic movie, I am talking about Nacho Cerdas AFTERMATH. This movie is just about pure splatter effects and necophilism, there is no story, no music, no atmosphere.

So if you want a very SPECIAL movie about necrophilism WATCH IT!!!!!

It is not reallhy a horror film though other than just utterly disgusting. But I love these kind of films. It pushes the boundaries more than any other film I have ever seen in dealing with necrophilia. One of the most shocking films on celluloid. The film almost looks like a snuf film and its the most grotesque films I have ever witnessed. Its like running a soldering iron through your brain. Once you see it you will be scarred for life. NO KIDDING! Do not let the kids see this one. I have seen just about every horror film in the world and this is the most macabre. Pleasant viewing.",1307059200,2,767,4.260273972602739

8061811,5,B0009J93V4,"Simply put, Nekromantik is a film that delves into the taboo topic of necrophilia. Yes, it is sick, yes, it is disgusting, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a great movie. It does have captivating cinematography, and the acting is pretty convincing all things considered. It's more of a visual experience, there's not a whole lot of dialogue, which adds to the haunting nature of the film. Regarding the plot, the protagonist, Rob, works for a streetcleaning agency that deals with cleaning up after crime scenes, car crashes and the like. He brings home souvenirs from his job and displays them in his apartment with his equally demented girlfriend Betty. One day, Rob brings home a slimy corpse (which for a prop, looks convincingly real) and you can probably fill in the rest. It is a disgusting movie, but it's not as explicit as you would think. It also has one of the craziest endings I've ever seen in a film. If you think you have the stomach for it, I'd definitely recommend it.",1507075200,,990,4.598870056497175

The movie can be along with ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, ATTACK OF THE KILLER THOMATOES, PINK FLAMINGOS, ERASERHEAD, FANTASTIC PLANNET.

But this is the strongest.

Graphic, low-budget gore-shocker about Rob and Betty, a couple of ordinary necrophiles who apparently don't mind if their dead sexual partners are not so fresh. Rob's job affords him the opportunity to bring home corpses and the odd body part; when he loses his job, he loses Betty, and Rob's life gets REALLY bizarre.
When Rob cannot stand anymore, he kills himself and burried inside the land, guess who came along to dig it?

It is an odd movie to watch.
When three of them have sex the image becomes afterimage, artistic like, blur so we cannot see all the details.
Some will call it an art, some will call it a 70s 80s porn theater look.
The movie was shot in 35mm but the final print was 8 mm so what we see is not widescreen so we feel like watching a low budget cheap porninsh film.
But thanks to late technology they clearn it all up with HD and the image is very decent.

There are a lot of new things to watch.
Body parts and all.
When I was studing at CalArts MFA program, there is this experimental course showing a long documentary about automsy a most beautiful woman. It started with a naked dead woman. And then they start to dissect her part by part. We see everything from her vulva, vagina breast and everything. It almost feel like it is immoral.
And we finally see her inner parts dissected. Her heart, her lung, her breast cut out, her hands, her legs cut out, now nothing's left but a bunch of parts and bloods.
There were 100 of students at the beginning but when the film was over there were only 5 inlcude me.

This movie was not that shocking and all we see is a rabbit evenly being all cut dead, but it is quit a ride too.

There is no true love it's all about craze for something dead body and feel of sex for dead corpse sticky corpse nightmarish.

But I tell ya, it's interesting still.",1476144000,,2026,4.401069518716578

With that said, it was not a bad film. The pacing was very poor and some scenes dragged on a bit. But some of the scenes were very well shot. The story dynamic between the two characters and the dead body was tastefully done. Underground horror fans will want to check it out so they can check it off the block. Non-horror fans may actually be disgusted by the idea of the film, but that's the point. Overall, not great but not bad.",1470009600,,596,4.146551724137931

8061818,3,B0009J93V4,"Impossible to describe or rate in any convential way, Necromantik can only be called what it epitomizes: underground film, in this case German underground film. It is not seamlessly made nor a masterpiece nor pretty to look at. But it is certainly different, and ostentatiously creative in it's own individual way. What plot there is involves a morgue worker's grisly experimentation with necrophilia, and various strange scenes which, German critics claim, are a commentary on postwar Germany (circa 1980s). Horror is a large element here but is not the only one, and the story comes off more like a particularly gruesome drama than anything else. Bizarre traces of redemption narrative also enter the picture, especially with an unforgettable climactic sequence involving a particularly gory suicide, and the memory of a slaughtered rabbit who the suicidee seeks to return to life. Without doubt it's likely the strangest and bloodiest scene, in a lifetime of movie viewing, that I can still call ""moving"" in an emotional way. To say that this film is not for all tastes is not nearly a strong enough warning. Simply put: do not enter unless this review  piqued a serious curiosity!",1465776000,,1184,5.103092783505154
