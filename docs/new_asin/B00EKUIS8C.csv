8606490,4,B00EKUIS8C,"This had a slow start, but then everything picked up.  The subtitles are not perfect, but are better than both 'Iris' & 'Athena Goddess of War'.  A good mix of both action and drama.  If you liked 'Iris' then you should really check this out also (you will have to give it more than just a couple of episodes).  'Iris' is definitely better, but I am glad to have watched this and to have it added to my collection.",1399248000,,414,4.2025316455696204
8606491,2,B00EKUIS8C,"The action is too much. The camera moves too fast. I had a hard time reading the subtitles and keeping up with how fast the camera moved from character to character or from scene to scene.  This drama is not nearly as good as Iris the original.  The character depth is not great either.  Jang Hyuk looks good, but I still cant get into the plot as of yet.  I  really don't care what happens to the chracters, unlike the original.  I would not recomend it.  Get Iris  ( the original ) instead.",1397692800,,492,4.21505376344086
