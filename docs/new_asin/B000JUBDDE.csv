The music near the end is annoying. I want to hear the engine when I watch train tapes.
It stopped playing before the last 3 chapters had run. Same story on my computer where I got a ""severely damaged"" message.
However I looked with a magnifier and there is NO damage. It just won't play.",1389571200,,524,4.198019801980198
8153072,5,B000JUBDDE,"I had heard somewhere about the 2-foot gauge railroads in Wales, and unusual steam locomotives they operated, some having been imported from South Africa. ""Boy, would I everl like to hear and watch those in use!"", I thought. But I knew I'd never get to Wales. Then I got a catalog from a small firm listing their railroad DVDs. I'd never heard of the firm, either. I had a gift credit at Amazon which I wanted to use, but I knew Amazon would never carry such an offbeat item. Was I ever glad to be wrong! Courtesy of a daughter and son-in-law, I could treat myself watching narrow gauge Welsh steam, with Fairlie double-enders and Beyer-Garratt three-section articulated locomotives. What stunning sound and mesmerizing motion set against the glorious Welsh countryside. This is a DVD I'll watch over and over, thanks to Highball Productions, Amazon, and my family members.",1206230400,,873,4.865771812080537
