804934,3,630411219X,"Soft porn, no question. I'm totally fine with that, just stating the facts. I'd say there's a sex scene every 5 minutes, for about 10 minutes. It reminds me of Playboy videos I used to watch. Barely a story, and barely any clothes. The women were all totally hot, but after years of hard core in my diet, this only gets you so far. I'd imagine a lot of women would like this film. There is a plot, almost, and the sex is penetration-free. It's not just minutes and minutes of pounding. Even the nudity got kind of boring. Again, if I was 16 this would have been the best thing I ever saw.

804939,5,630411219X,"OK, first off, I bought this one because Jacqueline Lovell (Head Of The Family, Hideous!) is in it. I admit that I paid little attention to reviews. Well, FEMALIEN is a light-hearted soft-core romp w/ just enough of a story to tie the many love-scenes together. Venesa Talor is the title character, here on earth to experience human pleasure. She uses her powers to help her in this venture. Now, I was not offended or shocked by this mostly naked movie. I guess I'm just getting old, because I found myself fast-forwarding through most of the lovey-dovey parts. However, as this sort of movie has a rather obvious objective, I'd say it accomplishes this very well indeed! The women are beautiful and the encounters are more erotic than raunchy. So, even though it's not for me, I highly recommend FEMALIEN to all the flesh fans out there...",1215129600,,841,4.727891156462585

804977,2,630411219X,A DVD of clear good photography and quite pleasant to watch but a little embarrasing in family company.  Really only suitable for watching in private.,1153008000,10,150,5.0
804978,4,630411219X,"So many reviews, please read the synopsis or others for the ""plot"" details. Here's what's important - this flick is pretty much wall to wall skin, some decent pink (no spreads that I remember), and erotic fun.

There is a bit of filler to fast forward thru (silly subplot about saving a diner, blah blah). A sexy alien experiencing human lust is enough for plot - I guess these folks can't help themselves.

But Femalien has turned me into a real fan of Jacqueline Lovell, the pretty blonde who is actually a good performer who delivers her lines believably, and particularly Venesa Taylor. Venesa will blow you away here - pretty girl-next-door face, dreamy eyes, long legs and amazing double Ds that will have you short of breath. She's so hot, it may take you a couple viewings to make it thru the movie (get my drift). The scenes w/ other performers, including some mid-90s porn stars, are all adequate, but the scenes w/ Jacqueline and/or Venesa are stellar.

All & all very good for this type of movie, though I would have liked more pink.",1145404800,40,1045,4.60752688172043
804979,5,630411219X,My husband and I have enjoyed many wonderful nights thanks to this movie. Some movies have problems with keeping us interested but this one did the job. Kudos to the writers.,1140739200,11,174,4.645161290322581
804980,1,630411219X,"Flat lighting, cheap sets and costumes, dull dialog, wooden acting, and a goofy plot; even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this movie.

Now of course there are better softcore flicks, but this one was just.....cool. I don't like using that word but it's rather appropriate. I liked the way that the fantasies that a lot of us have are used to make this movie good. Go ahead and buy. 5 bucks is a reasonable price.",1125014400,6,437,4.2023809523809526
804982,4,630411219X,"This was my first venture into any explicit sex movie. The acting was, well, bad. But who's really watching it for that? Some of the women were cute, but mostly fake. One or two of the guys were hot.

Kara has just beamed down from a planet that wants to study human sensations. She's naked in the first scene and for most of the rest of the movie. It starts when she sees her neighbor sun-tanning and wanting her guy to put oil on her so she won't burn. After not alot of coaxing, they start going at it right there in the yard completely naked, in multiple positions. Kara experiments by herself watching them and then gets off while watching people she's 'touched' (she makes them feel really good). She makes some models do it, a guy at a cafe, then two women at a lingerie store get it on just for Kara to watch. They invite her to a kinky party with just women and she gets 'some more experience'. The best part is the end where there are three couples at a meditation center, that Kara touches. She always wants more experience.

To sum it up, plot 20% of the movie. Sex scenes 80%. Definitely more guy erotica, but it was good for its purpose. Could've used more guys in it though. I'd buy it again.",1122076800,11,1207,4.2663755458515285
805023,4,630411219X,"Nice show.  All the ladies were good looking, especially the ""Alien"".  I would have been satisfied just watching her in the massage room, for the whole 90 minutes.",1121817600,3,163,4.785714285714286
805024,4,630411219X,"As a nerd, I'd always dreamed that a race of nymphomaniacal superwomen would descend upon me from space and probe me to no end. Until the night it happened. It turns out excessive probing can be quite painful, not to mention humiliating. Femalien offers those nerds too scared to undergo sexy alien abduction a legitimate erotic alternative. Three billion thumbs up.",1117238400,6,366,5.016393442622951
805025,5,630411219X,Enjoyed it from the first scene. Enjoyed watching femaline try to understand our individual sexual appetite and in exchange she shared her collection from thru-out the universe. She was kind and willing to try what was suggested. It helps to have a knock out personality along with a knock out body. Then I found myself really trying to understand how someone from outside would view us. You wait for each new action scene and her feedback.,1110153600,2,440,4.802631578947368
805026,4,630411219X,"I was in the mood for some alien invasion movies the other day and watched a small marathon.  As well as such movies as The Arrival, I watched a film called Femalien.  Femalien reminds me of a modern remake of The Girl From Starship Venus.
Femalien is the story of an alien landing on Earth to study human interactions.  The energy being is given the form of a young woman.  What follows are scenes of her spying on couples and her interactions with others.  The alien is collecting and cataloging experiences for her race who have risen above physicality but still miss it.  During her adventures she tries to help a local woman retain ownership of her diner.
While the plot is weak I do recommend this film for those times when a movie like Invasion of the Star Creatures or Galaxina is the sort of thing you are looking for.",1084838400,32,827,4.443708609271523
805027,1,630411219X,"No plot,waste of time and money in this 'Disney Porn' flick with ugly girls and stupid story line,Stay away!!!",1067299200,2,110,4.842105263157895
805028,5,630411219X,"Possibly my fave surrender film.  I was very pleased to find this here.  The price was right so I had to go for it.  If you are into minimal plot and alot of soft stuff, go ahead and get this one.",1057795200,3,196,3.731707317073171
805029,4,630411219X,"It may seem like an oxymoron, but this soft-core is intelligent. Sure it's a easy to follow plot of an alien woman come to study sex, but as she moves from one episode to another they are all well linked. This film has a plot!
And the woman are excellent! This is also much much better than the sequel. Make sure to get the unrated version.",1049846400,8,340,4.166666666666667
805030,5,630411219X,"I have to say I really enjoyed Femalien.  Yes, it's undeniably soft-core porn, but it is absolutely the best movie of this type I have ever seen.  The plot isn't anything to brag about, but it does make some sense and holds together quite nicely.  Femalien is an alien ""collector"" sent to earth to study human intimacy.  Her people have evolved beyond physical bodies to become energy beings, and intimacy has been lost in the process.  Femalien is given a ""suitable"" form (I'll say!) that will allow her to pass herself off as a human being and learn all about interpersonal relations by observing humans interacting with one another.  She doesn't have to look very far to find subjects for study, and she is a quick learner, engaging in her own interaction experiments before very long.

This whole movie just exudes professionalism, from the acting to the camera work to whatever else directors do that makes a film a real treat to watch.  You won't find this many attractive women in most films of this type, either.  Venesa Taylor in particular is a living doll; hers is a classic beauty that is quite rare these days.  She is just completely captivating.  She has talent, too, and her naive, innocent manner of speech and appearance just suits her role in this movie to a tee.  The sex scenes, even the ones that don't include Venesa Taylor, are also as good as you will find in movies of this genre.  Basically, Femalien has it all.  Forget about all the disappointments you may have felt when watching other supposedly good movies of this type; Femalien is sure to please.  As long as you are aware of this movie's exceedingly erotic nature and don't approach it expecting a thrilling science fiction adventure, there is simply no way you can be disappointed.",1046390400,133,1767,4.710097719869707
805031,1,630411219X,"I thought this movie was going to have an incredible plot - All I wanted was to be able to go home and watch a really bad movie.  This movie was different.  It went beyond the limit of manass.  It would have been better with Chuck Norris- 10 TIMES BETTER. ""Sun"" should have had more speaking parts where we could get to know her better. Next time, see Cyborg 2 with Angelina Jolie instead.",1039219200,2,389,4.22972972972973
805060,4,630411219X,"Femalien is probably among the most famous softcore movies to date, thanks to its undeniably campy premise and graphic sex. I don't know, softcore films usually bore me, but there are exceptions (like The Erotic Witch Project, The Alien Files, Casting Couch) and this is one of them.
Part of the reason's got to be the silly sci-fi premise, which is about a female alien (get it, femalien?!) who comes to Earth to observe humans engage in sexual interaction. By that alone, this softcore film has more plot than three average late-night cable flicks combined. So, basically, the movie doesn't consist of much more than 90 minutes of this femalien (played by Venesa Talor), calling herself Kara in a hilariously dumb scene, watching people have sex while getting off on it, even occasionally joining in on the fun. Well, okay, there is the subplot with the chick named Sun (Jacqueline Lovell) who owns a diner that's about to be shut down by a guy who owns a massaging company, but it pretty much exists only as a set-up for Talor and Lovell to get it on.
Femalien has a pretty decent sense of humor, which also places it above most films of its kind. Yeah, the jokes are awful, but they have a unique anti-charm that works in its favor (and Venesa Talor is so gosh-darned gorgeous, you can't help but get sucked in by her character's naivete).
There are numerous sex scenes in this film, so I'll give a rundown of the highlights. Let's see, there's the photoshoot segment, which is actually probably the film's highlight. Whoever the actress is playing the other part of this coupling during this scene, I'd like to know her name. Simply put, she's hot. The other standouts include Venesa Talor's two love scenes, there's the superior one with the guy in the diner and another very graphic one with Jacqueline Lovell, which is so graphic, I could almost swear they were really going at it. Nice.
Performances are mostly really bad, though Venesa Talor, in a campy B-movie way, excels as the hottie alien. It's got to be the naive way she approaches every situation, which isn't too unlike Starman, but come on, she's easier on the eyes than Jeff Bridges. Okay, that's an understatement, considering she's one of the sexiest women I've ever seen.  Yeah, she's had work done on her (now very large) breasts, but I for one think they look great and at any rate, are far more of a turn on than the ludicrous basketballs on Shauna O'Brien's chest.
Femalien sure isn't a good movie, not by a long shot, but it's an enjoyably silly one that can be easy to take thanks to non-stop sex and nudity. There's also a sequel, but I have yet to see the uncut version of it (which sort of defeats the purpose of watching softcore).

Which there were an endless string of. Starting with in minutes of the start when Femalien looks out her window and watches the neibors get it on in the backyard. The kink scene left me cold. Maybe the scene will seem kinky to a really Vanilla person, but hardly anyone else. The actors were so-so. They didn't look bored, but didn't seem to put much into their roles. Most of the acress were agmented and in one case had the profile that comes from a bad job of surgury. The main star had a wonderful face which reminded me of Jennifer Tilly.

805067,1,630411219X,"This movie (the unrated version) has received much praise, from what I have seen. It has been described as ""very sexy"" by more than one viewer. Well, there are heaps of nude people, for sure.  However, the nudity, as it comes across to the viewer, is not sexy. It is rather boring, in fact. True, the women are pretty (with notable exceptions) and they have fine bodies (with notable exceptions) and thus they could, should the script/direction have provided the opportunity,  have put on fine performances. Yet they do not. They seem...well, bored. And they ""act"" as if they have never had sex before: as if this was the first time and they had all their knowledge from adult magazines and hardcore novellas. But I guess that's the fault of the director. And the males? Well, I am sure the director was joking when he decided to trot them onto the screen because never, even in the worst porn films, have I seen a greater collection of un-handsome male ""actors."" Gread bodybuilders, no doubt, but man do they have empty faces! What's left? The script: It's a collection of vignettes joined together by a common thread, the lead actress, who appears to have an aversion to frontal nudity. The set: Very cheap. For the most part it looks like a hastily put-together set of a porn movie, not real environment. The camerawork: Flat. Unimaginative. Total aversion to the mixing together of close-ups, medium and wide shots of the same scene. Yet the camera is on a tripod - well, you get the picture. Lighting: Harsh. Coupled with the strong, almost unnatural colors of the set it becomes almost hurtful. Conclusion: Most of us, lovers of the soft core genre, would want to be turned on by a movie. This, however, turns you off. Don't waste your time.",979689600,7,1747,4.687296416938111
805068,5,630411219X,"Easily Surrender Cinema's All-Time Title. It has everything guys like me want to see to excess--thin storyline, and great-looking,  surgically-altered women. The story revolves around Kira, played by Vanesa  Talor, who I might add, is the most beautiful woman on the face of this  earth. After viewing this movie with my wife (a former Miss South  Carolina), she purred, ""I've never thought about another woman  sexually, until now."" In fact, she has even allowed me to extend an  invitation to Vanesa for a night of unbridled passion (I'm still waiting  for her to respond.) The scene that did it for my wife was the one with her  and Jacqueline Lovell (a real cutey). This scene was as close to XXX as you  can get. It should not be missed! Throughout the entire film, the sex was  intense, the girls were mind-numbingly hot, and the story, although thin,  was fun. Don't rent this film ... Buy it. Buy it now, but buy the unrated  version.",967766400,59,942,4.676829268292683

It's the more serious Sci-Fi aspect plus serious treament of sex and sexual issues, and concerns I was after. Did not get it here. Maybe I not smart enough to appreciated this particular versions of campy. A few laughs humor might have gotten a higher rating for these gorgeous pretty people's effort.
