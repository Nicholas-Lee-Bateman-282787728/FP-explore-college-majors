3754906,2,B001PO7J9A,"The instructor knows what she's doing and the exercises are well taught.  But the quality of the video is poor and the instructor is rather dull and lacks personality.  Additionally, the background music is repetitive and boring.  The exercises are fine to do, but between each one there is about 60 seconds to rest, which is fine, but fun music to move in place or something would be so much better than what's there, which is basically nothing.  This is a good DVD to learn some exercises from, but it is way to boring to use more than a couple of times.",1250640000,21,556,4.421568627450981
3754907,5,B001PO7J9A,"I am an avid fan of KB's and believe they are the only workout tool that a person needs. This DVD is FUN and super effective. This DVD contains instructions, warm-up, a short 12-minute workout, and a longer 40-minute workout. I was skeptical that the 12-min workout would be as effective as I had read in other reviews. What I found is that in the first 30 SECONDS your heartrate truly increases so that it is in the optimal range for burning fat, and you are sweating within the first ONE MINUTE. There may not always be time for a proper 45 minute to 1 hour workout during our busy schedules, but there is always time for a measly 12 minute workout (except this 12-minute workout is anything except 'measly'). If you feel that the 12-minute workout is too easy and ineffective, then you are not doing it correctly, or you need to use a heavier KB. You should be thanking Lauren Brooks for all of the breaks that she gives you between each set (it's THAT effective). I love this DVD.",1244592000,82,984,4.412087912087912
3754908,5,B001PO7J9A,The 40 min workout was great. 2 minutes work then 1 minute rest. At first the rest period was easy enough but by the 12 round I really needed the 1 minute break. Really gets my wind and a great burn in the legs. There is also a 12 minute workout 1 minute work 30 sec rest. Well worth the money.,1243382400,7,294,3.8360655737704916
3754909,5,B001PO7J9A,"I purchased this DVD in December 2008 and have been using it regularly for the past year.  When I began, I was totally out of shape and was using only a 7lb bell.  I have progressed to a 15lb bell, a 20 and recently moved up to a 25lb bell.  Some of the body weight exercises, such as push-ups, squat thrusts and mountain climbers were too difficult at the beginning, but I stuck with it and am now able to do them with no trouble.  I have reduced my resting heart rate from a horrible 94 beats per minute down to 67, and have lost nearly 40 lbs, 8 inches from my waist and really firmed up my arms, legs, shoulders and back.  I owe it all to this fantastic DVD!  Including a 12 minute workout was genius on Lauren's part, because it really gives beginners confidence to learn and practice the moves and get in better condition for the 40 minute workout.  I feel so much better physically and mentally since using this workout.  Highly recommended!!!",1235865600,205,950,4.327683615819209
3754910,5,B001PO7J9A,"I recently started using kettlebells by purchasing videos from another instructor after seeing his ""infomercial"" (Kettleworx).  Thank God I discovered Lauren Brooks; she is 100 times better than what I already had.  Her instructions are clear, her form (and her partner's) is excellent, and the DVD is a great production overall.  I really appreciated the detailed guidelines (proper weight selection, etc.) and instructions she provided (for 15 exercises) prior to completing any of the workouts.  You can tell she knows what she is doing and her personality is great.  I was using a 10 pound bell but I purchased a 15 pound bell prior to attempting Lauren's workout; I was so glad I did--it made the workout much more challenging and I felt wonderful afterwards.  I am looking forward to increasing my kettlebell weight and I hope Lauren completes another video soon.  (I returned Kettleworx to the manufacturer; I was thankful for the refund.)",1235433600,87,946,5.103896103896104

3754912,5,B001PO7J9A,This is such a great workout!  This DVD has 2 different workouts.  One is a 45 min workout and the other is about a 12 min workout for when you are short on time.  I use an 18 lb kettelbell and I get a serious workout.  I'm an avid exerciser and I am hooked on this workout!,1233964800,7,274,3.754385964912281
3754933,5,B001PO7J9A,I bought this for the 12 minute workout and have been very happy with it.  12 minutes is about my max if I want to stick with the program.  It's a good workout - I am out of breath and feel great after.  I've also felt stronger in general since I began.  I use a 20 lb kettlebell.,1457395200,2,280,3.7758620689655173

I was looking to buy this beginner volume for the 12 minute workout to start kettlebell training with. I'm really frustrated because now I need to wait for a re-order to come in and I have to bother with the return process to get my money back for this Volume 3. I don't trust ordering from this listing again, though, in case I end up with another incorrect DVD. I was hoping to start my kettlebell training today.

3754953,2,B001PO7J9A,"So I have been exercising for the last 4 years and after reading the great reviews about the dvd I decided to order it and I was disappointed. first she will give you too many breaks so the 40 minutes workout will only be about 25 minutes of a workout because every 90 seconds she will give you a 1 minute break which I found very boring. I did not feel that I got a workout at all and I just felt I was wasting my time. I prefer Paul Katami, he will give you a good workout. I consider my self advance and I did not find this dvd challenging at all.",1429142400,2,550,3.8761061946902653
3754954,2,B001PO7J9A,"So far, I have done a couple of the workouts. She gives you way too much rest time (30 seconds after about 2 minutes of exercise), so I find myself fast-forwarding to get a good workout. Bob Harper, Brooke, and Jillian are much better. This is pretty dated.",1428969600,2,257,4.375

I do know her 40 minute workout is tough and I (50+ year old woman) was mighty proud at my ability to complete the workout. A nice variety of kettlebell moves mixed with push-ups, squat-thrusts and mountain climbers that WILL get your heart pumping!",1399507200,4,346,4.688524590163935
3754960,5,B001PO7J9A,"I learned about kettle bells working with a trainer, and I wanted to do more at home.  I watched this DVD all the way through, and then started to do some exercises, and tried a workout.  This is clear, concise and efficient.  All of the basics I learned from the trainer were adequately covered in the exercise demonstrations.  The workouts were done in real time, with the 30 seconds of rest between exercises, and they were good programs.  I read all of the reviews, including the one and two stars, and after reviewing the DVD and using it, I think those reviewers missed the point.  I am very happy with this DVD and recommend it unconditionally to either new kettle bell users or more experienced ones to get started right away and to get a good full body workout.",1395964800,4,770,4.503597122302159
3754961,5,B001PO7J9A,"Read many reviews and I decided that I wanted to buy this DVD to learn kettlebells.  Lauren is an excellent instructor the section where she demonstrates how to do each exercise is excellent.  She wants to make sure your form is good. I started with a 15lb KB within two weeks I bought a 20lb. KB. I started this workout Jan 15, 2014.  The 15lb was good to learn the form, but after two weeks it wasn't enough so I went to the 20. This week I started using 25lb KB this should do for a little while.  Each time I increase the weight It changes the exercises.  Lauren does two exercises and then takes a break.  I didn't like that at first, but after upping my weight I began to appreciate those breaks. I do the joint mobility before and after the workout and that makes the workout last about 52mins. There is a very short 12 min workout I've done that once it's too short when I workout I want to get it on. I will buy Lauren's other workouts.  Many complain that her DVD's are expensive and they are but I think they are worth it.  Cheaper than a personal trainer. I like her pace she knows what she's doing, and she's not all happy happy, she's all about business.",1394064000,7,1168,4.20627802690583
3754962,3,B001PO7J9A,"Enjoyed the workouts with this CD for a few weeks and also did get muscle strength. However, kettlebells require you to snap your hips forward with every swing, causing pain in lower spine",1391644800,3,188,4.7272727272727275
3754973,4,B001PO7J9A,"Let me start off by first saying that I'm definitely a beginner. My fianc bought this for me after he started working out with the kettlebell. I've done it on a few occasions.

My likes: Lauren is great at reviewing and explaining each move. She seems sweet and down to earth. The breaks seem silly at first, but once you get into the workout, you realize they are much needed. I do think once I progressed in my strength, I may require less rest time but i don't know.

My dislike: Why is this DVD so much??? I don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth with it. I'd like more workouts. Maybe one or two more that will increase in intensity and hold my interest once I progress. Right now, I already feel bored and like I said, I've only done it a handful of times.",1390780800,7,768,4.217687074829932
3754974,5,B001PO7J9A,"I quite enjoy the DVD as well as Lauren, too. She is down to earth and unpretentious. She is not overly sculpted, but clearly in excellent shape. Inspirational. I like, also, that the DVD takes the time to teach proper form. VERY important. This was my frst kettlebell workout experience ever and I had no pulled muscles, etc. Recommended.",1389139200,3,339,4.762711864406779
3754975,5,B001PO7J9A,"I love this DVD!  I have already been doing kettlebell swings on my own for about 6 months but I wanted to take it to the next level.  This DVD is perfect for that.  It kicks my butt but is so worth it.  I love the section where she walks you through each exercise and how to do it properly.  I did this DVD the first time on Friday, just learned each exercise and then did the 12-minute workout once, and I was sore all day Saturday, all over my body.  The 12-minute workout didn't even feel toooo insanely challenging at the time. Today (Monday) I did the 40 minute workout and man what a workout! I fear how my muscles will feel tomorrow but I know it's giving me a great workout.  I have never had a personal trainer but I imagine this is similar to what it would be like...teaching you how to do new moves, leading you through well-planned workouts, challenging you to work harder than ever before.  Highly recommended for kettlebell users!",1388361600,3,945,4.329545454545454
3754976,5,B001PO7J9A,"I found kettlebells randomly on the internet about 4 years ago and ordered this dvd, and her second, and started using them without any other KB experience. Her instruction is so easy to follow and very thorough. I would totally recommend it for a beginner at any fitness level.

I got fantastic results with these workouts, only doing them 15-25 min/day, 3 days/week. I was able to easily maintain a loose size 6 eating whatever I wanted at age 45! A short workout only 3 times a week that gets results like that is a GREAT one.

However, personal trauma and life changes led me away from working out and now at age 48 I'm back to it. I have a few pounds to lose but I know these workouts will do it. I just ordered her brand new workout and looking forward to adding that to the que! KB's have turned out to be my ""soulmate"" form of exercise because you get ridiculous amazing results right where you want them (guts and butts and fat loss fast) and they are FUN. The most fun I've had working out. I love kettlebells!",1382486400,9,1020,4.307291666666667

3754980,5,B001PO7J9A,"Great intermediate kettlebell workout. The dvd is broken apart by ""workout"". So depending on your time allowance you can customize your workout for the day.

Lauren Brooks is a great instructor and provides demos of each exercise. I really like how she doesn't talk too much either - just enough to motivate and instruct.",1378944000,,321,4.944444444444445
3754981,5,B001PO7J9A,I bought Lauren's 1st dvd and loved it. Very clear instruction. And this one is the same. Great routine. Great Instruction. I like how the workouts mix and match. I can't wait for her next dvd!,1378598400,,193,4.388888888888889

3754983,5,B001PO7J9A,I love working out with Keettlebells and this is a great video for beginners. The moves are explained in detail and the workouts will have you sweating in no time.,1376352000,,163,4.466666666666667
3754984,2,B001PO7J9A,I hardly broke a sweat during this workout and I was using a 20 pound kettle bell.  I hated all the breaks. I even tried fast forwarding through the breaks and I still felt like I hardly got a work out. I would not recommend this to anyone who is experienced at kettle bell and wants to get their heart pumping.,1375315200,,311,4.098360655737705
3754985,5,B001PO7J9A,Great workout - awesome variety - intermediate to advanced moves. I started with Lauren Brooks iPad app and wanted more of a challenge after a couple  months. I found it in this DVD. I could probably stick with this one for a year without getting bored.,1374969600,,253,4.5
3754986,5,B001PO7J9A,"This DVD is expensive, but its still less than 2 kettlebell classes/workshops if you have a studio in your area. I think it is worth it because I trust Lauren's training and instruction. And I can do it over and over on my own time. Plus this DVD gives me some visual instruction to go with Laruen's book, which has TONS of workouts and is a much easier intro to a full workout. I'll probably use the DVD as visual for some moves, do the beginning workouts from her book, and then move onto this when I can handle it & don't want to think through following the book.

Plus if you are a REAL beginner (like me) you can do it in the privacy of your own home without embarrassing yourself about how out of shape you are. Seriously. Just going through one round of the instruction moves was a workout for me. I'll admit it!!! I tried it with a 15 pound bell and just that got a full body sweat. If you are like me (a 10 hour a day computer worker) who has barely above a hospital patient level of activity, start with a 10 pound bell (for a woman). She says start with 15-18 but that will kill you. Get this cheap one here or from Target:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reebok-Kettlebell/dp/B008R5I728/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reebok Kettlebell</a>then move up. Even a 10 pounder will leave you sore for a week until you progress, which is what I have been using for her book workouts.

Downsides: the video quality is low (think VHS) and the music reminds me of someone in college who just learned how to mix beats on their computer lol.",1374192000,4,1580,4.619217081850533
3754987,5,B001PO7J9A,"I've done the main workout twice now and I can see that it will be a favorite. The 40 minute length is slightly longer than the Skogg/Sarah Lurie workouts (30-32 mins) that have been my mainstays for the past 18 months. There is more of an interval format with 1 minute rests between the 2 minute workouts. This is a nice break in the beginning rounds of the workout but almost not enough during the last few rounds, where my heart felt like it was thumping out of my chest. I use a KB that is 1/5 of my bodyweight so that is nice and heavy, I could not  press any more than that. If you see any reviews that the workout is too easy, those persons are not using heavy enough kettlebells. I've already ordered Vol 2, for additional variety.

It's not glitzy, but I don't need glitz when I am concentrating everything on finishing the 2 minute rounds. I like that she cues verbally to switch sides in 3 seconds and I don't have to watch the tape to know when to do it. I like the few bodyweight segments intermixed, it makes for a well rounded workout.

In general, I have found that I like workouts that start at light to medium intensity and ramp up to heart pounding and sweating half way through to the end. The Bob Harper ones are fun but a bit too tough and long. The RKS ones are in general too short (15 mins avg) you can certainly do 2 back to back. I tried AOS Santa Monica but that didn't quite take with me, not sure why.

In summary, happy I finally got this and it will be thrown into my Skogg/Lurie rotation.",1374019200,5,1521,4.180887372013652

3754990,5,B001PO7J9A,"I really cannot say enough good things about this DVD and Lauren Brooks. I was a little unsure about the price but can tell you it is worth every penny...and more. I ordered and received the video in three days with Prime and couldn't wait to get started. Lauren is a fantastic, caring instructor..and she is Russian Kettlebell Certified which is very important! I liked Lauren's style from the first minutes and immediately felt confident  handling the kettlebell with her instruction. The video is set up very nicely too: Lauren explains and demonstrates all of exercises in a straightforward, relaxed and easy way and then you can choose between a short(12 min)or long 40 min) workout.

The workouts are FUN and very thorough at the same time. I do the 12 min workout every morning to start my day right/energized! I do the 40 min workout 2-3 times per week at night - in addition to the morning workout. I also alternate Jillian Michaels' No More Trouble Zones and Killer Buns and Thighs DVDs. On the JM days, I find myself wanting to do the kettlebell workouts...but force myself to switch it up!

If you are unsure what kettlebell workout to buy...choose this one and you won't be disappointed. I will definitely buying Lauren's Vol 2 and 3.

3755004,4,B001PO7J9A,"I absolutely LOVE this video.  I'm a woman in my early 40s and I've been an avid exerciser for many years (P90x, Insanity, Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper, not to mention running half marathons and triathlons).  I wanted to try kettlebells but had no idea how to get started.  I'm so glad I found this DVD!  Lauren breaks down each movement and shows you how to safely swing the bell and do the other moves on the DVD, which is SO IMPORTANT!!  She is not annoying at all and her moves are challenging and effective.  The only thing I don't like is the 1 minute rest between rounds.  I find it too short so I fast forward through it and it ends up being about 30 seconds which I prefer.  There are 2 main workouts, one is a 12 minute ""quickie"" which I personally think is too short, but if you need something quick it's great.  The other is a 40 minute total body workout which is really about 32 minutes due to the 1 minute rests between sets.  It gradually gets harder in intensity and the last round is a high intensity round that leaves you breathless.  There is no cool down - she does an ab segment as a cool down but I prefer an actual stretching segment. It's not a really big deal, I just do my own after the DVD is over.  The setting is nice, she's outside on a rooftop, and the woman she's with is older and looks fabulous which is quite motivating.  I love Lauren and have purchased her Volume 2 workout and her Kettlebells for Women book, both of which I highly recommend.  This lady knows her stuff and I look forward to much more from her.",1367107200,9,1550,4.227891156462585

It has multiple workouts that you can mix and match to both vary your workout and customize based on the amount of time you have to exercise.  I appreciate that Lauren has a separate menu item for instructional video that shows you proper form and technique for the different exercises.  That way, the workout videos are packed with movement instead of a lot of ""down time"" explaining things, like I've seen in other kettlebell workouts.  I also appreciate the 30-second recovery breaks in between each circuit.  Her DVDs are much more expensive than other kettlebell DVDs, but I think it's totally worth the extra cost.",1364342400,3,666,4.8584070796460175
3755007,1,B001PO7J9A,"Absolutely do NOT recommend this DVD. No introductions, no explanation of the workout or what weights are suggested. She goes right into each exercise with no preface or instruction whatsoever. This is so rudimentary and amateur, that I could have done better! There are so many good instructional programs out there--don't waste your heard-earned money on this one. I'm returning it despite the fact that I am only receiving a partial refund.",1362700800,,443,5.166666666666667
3755008,3,B001PO7J9A,"Well I of course read all other reviews before I purchased this DVD and I am glad that I bought it.  Lauren does an excellent job of giving you a great work out, but for someone who is suppose to be a physical instructor I wish that she would have given more pointers on the moves that she does in the video.  I have a herniated disc in my back and I felt that if I was doing the moves wrong that I could really hurt myself. there is an instructional section to watch at the beginning of the DVD but lets face it we sometimes need coaching as we are doing the exercises to keep us on track as to not cause injury.  There was also no cool down/stretching at the end of the video.  I guess after doing other videos and physical therapy I know what exercises to do that will give a proper stretch. I also did not like the part at the end where she does a small ab section.  She does two moves and to be honest I put in one of my other videos to finish out my abs (Gilad 45/45 split)(He does a great ab workout).  So overall I like the video (I am really sweating at the end and I have already lost a couple of pounds along with cutting out junk food) and would purchase it again if I was asked to.  Maybe Lauren might read this and improve her workout some.",1362614400,7,1254,3.9721115537848606
3755009,5,B001PO7J9A,"Highly recommend for anyone just getting started with kettlebells.  The instructions are clear, she reminds you of your form and it is a killer workout!!!",1362441600,,154,5.16
3755010,4,B001PO7J9A,"Someone from a local Kettlebell Gym recommended this DVD to me because I found their one hour Kettlebell Gym classes to be too demanding for my age and fitness level, or lack thereof.  So far, I really like this DVD.  Lauren does a great job of explaining all the moves and offering a quick workout as well as a more extensive workout. I also appreciate that she has a very ""no nonsense"" approach, meaning you don't have to listen to all kinds of silly motivational gibberish.  She just tells you what to do, how to do it and for how long.

My only criticism, and it's small, is that I would have liked the 30 second rests, between sets, to be shorter.",1362355200,3,652,4.319672131147541
3755011,2,B001PO7J9A,"Because of one glowing rating in particular, and because I thought the DVD expense surely reflected a superior product, I expected something amazing!  I was very disappointed.  I understand interval training, but the pattern of 2 minutes at medium intensity, followed by 1 full minute of recovery, for the entire routine, feels like a very inadequate workout.  Had I rated only the trainer, I would have given it 3 stars.  This DVD isn't nearly as good as another trainer's that I bought on sale at Target for 1/4 the price... I'm irritated at myself for spending my money on this!",1362009600,,581,4.78
3755012,5,B001PO7J9A,I love the way this DVD is put together. It has both a quick 12 minute fat-blast and a 40 minute total body workout. Even the 12 minute workout leaves you sweating and out of breath. I believe this workout would be great for beginners as well as the more advanced. I also love the hour glass time countdown on the screen that helps you see exactly how much time you have left on each exercise and the countdown for the rests shown on the screen too. I remember thinking 2 mins of work and a min of rest didn't sound that bad. Wow! It's an awesome workout!! Just seeing Lauren is motivating as well. Thank you Lauren!!,1360195200,2,617,4.237288135593221
3755023,5,B001PO7J9A,Great video...have gotten the whole family involved. Would highly recommend the video to beginners or intermediate kettle-bellers. Worth the money.,1359504000,,147,6.4
3755024,5,B001PO7J9A,"Lauren Brooks' DVD's deliver great workouts and great results. I love the way she breaks the workout into bite-sized sections, so you can fit it into your life. My first DVD of Lauren's was Kettlebell Lightning, which I love. Then, I got this one, and have been doing it almost exclusively for the past month. The abs section has made major changes in my core muscles -- strength-wise and in the way they look. I'm so incredibly happy with my Lauren Brooks DVD's and workouts. My only complaint is that there aren't more of them! I'm looking forward to the next installment.",1356048000,4,574,4.637254901960785
3755025,5,B001PO7J9A,"I am a long time exerciser but new to kettlebells, only incorporating them into my exercise regimen this past year.  All I really knew to start is that form is critical, and it is imperative to learn form from a certified kettlebell instructor.  I have heard great things about Lauren and decided I was going to choose this DVD to learn proper form.

This DVD has a lot of content, it includes two workouts, one is 40 minutes and the other is a short 12 minute fat blasting workout which can be done more than once for a longer workout.  Also included is a tutorial where Lauren explains the moves and demonstrates proper form and an extended warm up which I thoroughly enjoyed.

Many of the standard kettlebell exercises are included, double arm swings, suitcase deadlift, one arm swings, one arm rows to name a few.  Lauren also includes bodyweight exercises to really keep the heartrate up such as squat thrusts and mountain climbers.  Each set contains a few exercises generally done together, followed by a 60 second rest.  A short ab section is also included.

Lauren is joined by one backgrounder, they are exercising on a terrace with the city view behind them.  I really like the setting myself.  They are exercising in bare feet which is standard for kettlebell training, if shoes need to be worn flat soled shoes are preferred.  I am one who needs proper arch support so I wore my normal tennis shoes.  While this is not standard the only effect it has on me is that I may not be getting the proper range of motion.  This is something I will personally need to adapt to.

Overall I am pleased with this DVD, Lauren demonstrates excellent form and I feel I made a fine choice selecting this DVD to learn proper form.  The only quibble I have is that I would have preferred other kettlebell exercises in place of some of the bodyweight exercises though.  This is just a personal preference, I don't feel it takes away from the workout in any way.

I would highly recommend this DVD, it really is a fine introduction to kettlebells.  Lauren Brooks is one of the best instructors there is.  5 stars.",1355011200,2,2106,4.565333333333333
3755026,5,B001PO7J9A,This DVD has great instruction on how to do each move so that you don't risk injury. Its a great video for beginners or intermediate excercisers. You just adjust the weight of the kettlebell to your fitness level. I started out with a 10lb kettlebell and I grew out of that pretty fast as my strength increased rapidly within the first couple weeks. I then switched to a 15lb kettlebell and wow what a difference 5lbs makes. I still cant get through the entire 40 minute workout with the 15lb ball. I can do about 30 minutes. Its challenging. I've only been doing this for a month and I definitely notice more muscle tone in my arms and legs. I plan to keep using this a few days a week and am looking forward to even better results with longtime use.,1354665600,,751,4.333333333333333
3755027,4,B001PO7J9A,I have used it with her and it is very well done. The production value is minimal but that should not matter. The content and instruction is what is important. I highly recommend this DVD.,1352937600,,188,4.4
3755028,5,B001PO7J9A,"Before being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in June 2012, my son kept asking me to use kettlebells.  To appease him, I bought a 5 pound one and later a 10 pound one - and they sat on the shelf.  Always athletic, I continued with the Step that I've used for the past 20 years.  I would lose four or five pounds only to regain it.  Then came the frightening diabetes news and so many thoughts crossed my mind.  My son told me this was no time to hit the snooze button and I had to get into gear.

I started on a low carb diet and got the kettlebells off the shelf and started using them 5 times a week.  I bought two other kettlebell DVD's, one for beginners that ended up with her doing jumping jacks (*.*).  The other one has three people using the kettlebells with the lead gal perpetually smiling and saying something like no cardio is lardo.  No breaks, no pausing, too severe for me.  I told my son that I wasn't happy with the ones I bought and he suggested I look at the kettlebell queen, Lauren Brooks, on You Tube.  I liked what I saw and bought The Ultimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning with Kettlebells DVD and am I ever glad I did.

I like Lauren's soft approach and thorough explanations of what we're about to do and why.  I feel like I'm engaged when I'm working out to her DVD as there are messages on the DVD and a timer and Ms. Brooks tells us how long a particular work out will be and how long a break we will have.  A rest and water break!!!  There's a great idea!  It gives me a moment to cool down and get ready for the next segment.

I'm 64 years old and in spite of my athletic abilities when I was younger, I've never had strong arms.  Imagine my surprise when one day at the dinner table, for fun, I made a ""Popeye"" muscle - and I actually had a lump there - a good size one.  I don't think any one would want to see me in a dark alley!

I had no idea that you use 400 calories for a 20 minute workout.  Lauren's DVD has a warm up and a 12 minute work out along with a 40 minute one.  I keep up with them both and now have a 15 and 20 pound kettlebell that I use.  I cannot believe my strength and stamina.  Lauren's DVD includes a mountain climbing exercise that I used to just sit out or swing the kettlebells.  One day I thought, oh, what the heck, I'll give it a try.  And I can do it!!!  Again, never had strength in my arms, never able to do pushups and here I am on the back nine of my life and I'm doing it!

Since that June day, I have lost 37 pounds.  My glucose level has dropped from 137 to 104 (range 65-110). Cholesterol fell from 217 down to 164 (range:  120-200), LDL-Cholesterol went from 133 to 104.8 (50-130) and triglycerides came in at 213 and went down to 96.  (Range:  36-165.) (Today is 10/18/12 - not quite 4 months since the ""D"" date.)  I take no medicine as I prefer a holistic approach and believe that my success is due to my new eating plan and Lauren Brooks' kettlebells DVD.

I am amazed at the mobility I have - and I have no more back aches!!!  I'm sold on these kettle bells and glad my son 'introduced' me to her wonderful work.  I love her sensible and down-to-earth approach. I am going to purchase whatever else this 'kettlebell queen' has produced.  I'm sold - give it a try.  The only thing you have to lose is weight.",1350518400,24,3285,4.059190031152648
3755029,5,B001PO7J9A,"I have been ""lurking"" enough through the reviews and felt it fair to finally post my opinion.  I really enjoy this DVD.  It is a SERIOUS workout ! I think it is important to approach it like a one on one training session with a personal trainer.  No, there is no fancy choreography, or glitzy set.  The rest breaks that many have concerns about are really a lot like when your trainer has you take rest breaks between sets. If you give 100 % during the sets, you will NEED that break. I do not feel as if I have to pace myself, so I go ALL out during the sets ( I mean, toungue hanging, panting, grunting ALL out) because I know that rest is coming.  I am usually a little sore the next day, all over, but I am functional and I know that muscle is building.  I will definitely buy the other DVD's in her collection.",1350000000,6,815,4.09433962264151
3755030,5,B001PO7J9A,"I am in love with this dvd!!! I heard great things about kettle bell workouts and the fast results you can get so I figured I'd try it. First thing I did was search the web. I googled ""10 best kettlebell workout dvds"" and I believe this was was in the top 4 (keep in mind that was mens and womens.) I checked some of the reviews on here and that is what ultimately made up my mind. I was a little intimidated because I was new to kettlebells and any other dvd probably would've turned me off, but this dvd was perfect for me. The 30 second break in between each set makes such a difference especially when you are new to the dvd. The main thing I love about this is that it is straight kettlebell strength training and its not throwing in a bunch of annoying cardio like alot of women directed workout dvds tend to do. This gets right to the point. I didn't feel like I was overexerting myself too much while doing the moves but I still felt that wonderful workout soreness days later from all those squats. The 12 minute workout is THE BEST idea!! I do that workout when I'm feeling lazy and I always end up doing it twice because I feel so great after. It is also ideal for those days when you're short on time so you can get some type  of workout in. I have about 30 random workout dvds and this is the only one I felt happy and willing to do 3-5 times a week. Without even realizing it until someone pointed it out to me, this dvd got me in great shape in 3 weeks. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it!!!! Not only for women, but for men too. I am buying the 2nd dvd right now. Thank you Lauren Brooks!!",1346112000,4,1599,4.076190476190476
3755031,2,B001PO7J9A,"I began Kettlebells with Bob Harper Cardio Shred and Angie Miller Kettlebell Boot Camp. Both videos are great but in different ways. Bob Harper is a bit more arobic and is a really tough workout. Angie Miller is a bit more anarobic and I needed to improvise to protect my knees but a very good workout. I've been doing these videos on an alternating basis for about 6 months and can see results. I started with 15 lbs for both and now go back and forth between 20 and 25 lbs. Both videos are close to 1 hour in length with little rest time.

I liked the kettlebell workouts so much that I decided to try something new. After reading reviews I decided on Ultimate Body Sculpt by Lauren Brooks. The video was, for me, disappointing. I wanted something to kick it up a notch but the 2 minutes workout/1 minute rest was too much rest. I know you can fast forward but you end up
 with less than 30 minutes of workout. Also, I used 20 lbs for the entire workout and this seemed way too easy. I have a 35 lb kettlebell but I'm not sure that much weight would be wise.

All in all, the video is good but not great. If you want to get a really great kettlebell workout for a reasonable price you can get both Bob Harper and Angie Miller for less than 1 Lauren Brooks. The video quality of Harper and Miller is much better as well. Brooks is not my worst purchase but definitely not up to Harper and Miller. In my opinion I would use the Brooks video only when in a time crunch and then only if I could fast forward the rest periods.",1344816000,4,1523,4.15593220338983
3755032,5,B001PO7J9A,"I thought the video was pricey, but went off of the good reviews.  Laurens workout seems simple when you just watch the video, but boy you feel it when you do the workout.  Great all over body workout and something I can stick with.  I like her teaching methods and she is inspiring, just look at her physique from using the kettlebells.",1341964800,,337,4.403225806451613
3755043,4,B001PO7J9A,"This DVD cost more than I wanted to or should spend, but I gave it a go.  I like Lauren, she is to the point and not a lot of chatter. That being said, some pointers during the workout might be helpful for those new to the kettlebells because the instruction is in another section of the DVD. However, I really like the timers and the fact that they don't call for a specific number of reps. You just do as many as you can in the time allotted. I'm quite experienced with the kettle bells, but I'm not sure if this is for a an absolute beginner. I really love the kettle bells and feel it is a fast track to getting fit.  You just know it's working.
Nitpicking: I don't like the other person, Robin, being in the background. She throws off the symmetry. Or get a third person for the other side...perhaps a person that has more than 3% body fat. I know that sounds snarky, but not all of us workout for a living and we just want to be healthy and look the best we can. Got to say when they do the push ups it really is annoying. Lauren says (paraphrasing) ""Robin will do them on the kettlebell handles and I'll do them on my fists""....Really? I can do them but not on my fists or the kettlebell handles.  It's showing off.  She should be telling those who are just getting into working out an alternate way to do push ups. For example, on your knees and go down as far you can, etc. I can overlook all this, because all in all, I like the workout.
I would love to get volume two but another $40 is out of my price range right now.
More would be sold if they weren't so pricey!!",1339545600,11,1577,4.077419354838709
3755044,4,B001PO7J9A,"The DVD itself is fantastic. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but I like that she takes the time to break down each move, to make sure you have proper form and body mechanics down. I also like that there are two different workouts, depending on your endurance and time requirements.

My only complaint is that the first time I ordered- the DVD had popped out of the holder and was so scratched it didn't play. I returned, and ordered again, and the second DVD also arrived out of the DVD holder, and was scratched as well- but this one did play okay.",1337040000,2,562,4.30188679245283

Sucks because I'm abroad for the rest of the year and shipping it back would be more expensive than buying a new one. Never had this problem before.

I started out with a 9 lb kettlebell, you use two hands so that's very light but that was my fitness level. Now I use a 35 lb kettlebell. The DVD unlike other kettlebell DVDs has actual work outs that are timed and planned for you not just instruction, there is instruction but you can just do the work out is what I'm saying. There are two workouts, one is 40 minutes and one is 12 minutes. No matter what I can always find 12 minutes and at the end (like right now) I am dripping in sweat. She gives you 30 second rests, the work out is in intervals. I love Lauren Brooks DVDs, she's awesome. And her body is just inspirational.",1334880000,,767,4.260273972602739
3755048,4,B001PO7J9A,"I've previously taken in person Kettlebell classes which I loved and Lauren seems to teach a similar style, maybe because they both are kettlebell certified instructors and seem to love kettlebell?  I don't know, but this dvd will help me ease back into kettlebell after an injury, at my own pace.  My kettlebell class instructor presented different workouts each class, and added  a lot of personality to the workouts so this dvd doesn't come close to a real class as there's really just 1 40 minute workout and a condensed 10 minute workout, but seems to be most of the basic moves, which she does explain and present well.  Also, there seem to be much more and longer rest periods than in my live class too so it's not as intense as a real class so you probaly only get 20-30 minutes of actual exercising in.  However, I wouldn't be able to do a real hour long class at home because you don't have the live group motivating you, so maybe it's good that this workout seems shorter and easier.  It just seems for 40 bucks you'd get more than 1 workout although the quality of that workout I think is about all you could want, and if you stuck with this dvd, and didn't get sick of it after a while, you'd get in awesome shape I think.  Lauren is not annoying at all and seems to be pretty serious, so maybe it would take a while to get bored with this dvd.  I've only done it twice so far.  Delivery sucked - it arrived quickly, however within the padded envelope I could hear the dvd shaking around inside of the dvd jewel case.

She teaches proper techniques and is very easy to exercise with. I originally started out with 15 pound dumbbells and no have moved up to 25 pounders!

3755050,4,B001PO7J9A,"I purchased this DVD as it was raved about by people as ""the"" DVD to get.  I have just started using KBs but am pretty familiar with them and though I am a small female have spent out 15 years doing some form of serious resistance training. I am in decent to good shape.

I guess I do enjoy this DVD (hence the 4 star) rating...but I am unsure as to why this is 2x as much as other DVDs out there.  To keep it brief:

Pros:
-I like LB's style - she reminds me of me I guess..petite, female, similar age, no nonsense style - so I can relate
- She is inspirational  for a # of reasons and frankly how a trainer looks or instructor/how in shape they seem - fair or not - is part of an assessment
-Liked that was an older person in the video  to make it less intimidating
-Good form intros
-I liked the inclusion of body resistance work - as any trainer I have worked with has used these - and I think there are important. Her WOs are meant to be routines...not just KB drills.
-Nice outdoor setting

Cons (why 1 star off)
-No real cool down section  - I think for people new to KB  - trying to avoid extreme soreness and injury through proper post stretch is important..there are some stretches that are especially important to do for ex in KB training
-Would have like to see more moves for 40 bucks besides the basic ones you can learn on YT (Turkish getup, Figure 8s, etc).  While this is a nice DVD - these moves are basic basic
-Felt her workout partner's form was very poor at times.  Yes  - she was there just to be a companion and not as the instructor but it's glaring and I am not a PT or KB trainer
-Would like better production quality for the price

All in all - nice.  I think given I have a couple of decent intro CDs (I love AOS Providence!) and there are so many good YT tutorials on basic moves I could have passed on this one. I like LBs style way better than any of the other more popular female instructor led DVDs.  For non-female led DVDs, I like Anthony's style of AOS Providence and Newport, and I think alot of other female reviewers feel the same way.

If you know anything about KB or have any other decent intro DVD - I would spend the $ on Volume II",1332806400,,2176,4.072769953051643

Highly recommend.",1330732800,,369,4.630769230769231
3755053,5,B001PO7J9A,"Since beginning of Jan 2012, I have purchased several DVDs for kettlebell training.  I wanted to begin with this one, but when I received it, the case was broken and the disk had been floating around getting scratched up during delivery.  The little I watched before it froze up in my DVD player, I was very impressed with Lauren's technique and training style and couldn't wait to try it out.

Because Amazon's return policy isn't great for DVDs and being so anxious to try this workout, I went to Lauren Brook's website and contacted her directly.  A new DVD was promptly shipped to me. What awesome customer service!! I will purchase future DVDs from Lauren's site directly and not through Amazon.  Not sure happends during shipping, but I read others had similar problems with theirs.

OK, on to the workout.  Lauren's training and cueing style is not what I've been used to with other workout DVD's.  She's quieter and more focused on technique. If you're looking for an instructor that yells out the next move or counts down all the reps or chatters throughout the workout, this is not that.

The tutorial is REALLY GOOD for learning technique.  She reviews many basic kettlebell moves.  I would recommend practicing the techniques really well before starting the workout.  Use a mirror or have a workout buddy watch your form. I can't emphasize this enough. Ideally, we'd all have an RKC instructor available to train us in person...but they aren't easy to find and can cost a lot. This is the next best thing.

I experienced a full-body soreness after completing all the workouts on this DVD. I will continue to use the workouts, just increase the weight of the bell as it gets too easy.  You really could do this workout 2x/week and get amazing benefits. I can not believe how my strength has improved in such a short time.  I notice it most in my core and glutes/hamstrings. I can even do a couple of pushups now without being on knees. : )  Daily activities are suddenly easier...carrying groceries and laundry, power cleaning the house, etc.  I have more energy.  I haven't experienced this rapid strengthening with any other workout.  I've even convinced my 60 year old Mom to try it (and now she's hooked).  My husband went through the tutorial with me and plans to continue.  This is good stuff, folks.  I've heard comments from friends about the workouts looking dangerous. Well, yeah.  You're swinging a heavy cast iron ball around.  You have to pay attention to what you're doing and do the moves correctly.  I'm clumsy and prone to hurting myself and I haven't gotten injured...just take it slow.

Overall, GREAT workout...highly recommended.",1329868800,11,2661,4.8061674008810575
3755054,5,B001PO7J9A,"Just wondering why this DVD is so expensive($40)compared to the other KB DVD's which are $20 or under? Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy this video! Especially the 60 second breaks in-between exercises, with a preview of which exercises will be next so you can grab the appropriate bells and not feel rushed into the next set. I have used Pavel's From Russia with Tough Love & the  KB Goddess video as well. These provided precise instruction & proper form when using the KBs..& his book was very helpful too.",1328659200,,510,4.604395604395604
3755055,4,B001PO7J9A,Excellent but choppy. She carefully goes through about 12 kettlebell movements. Not particularly great video but she demonstrates well. There are several training loops but some were overwhelming for my level of exercise.,1328054400,,221,5.7272727272727275
3755056,4,B001PO7J9A,"Bought this as a gift for my husband. He had made his own routine for kettlebells and I was concerned that he wasn't properly executing some of the moves. There is a brief intro on how to do the exercises that is okay. The great part of the DVD is how it is broken down into a quick 12 min session and a longer session if you desire. There is also a cardio aspect incorporated into the routine with down-ups and push-ups. There are slight breaks, needed, between sets. He is continuing to use it all these months later. I found it way too difficult for me to complete all of the reps, but very easy to modify. He has always been in shape, I have never been there.",1327881600,,663,4.147286821705427
3755057,4,B001PO7J9A,"I will admit that this DVD is not the most professionally mastered workout that I have ever bought.  It seems like she filmed it with a standing camera on her balcony.  However, the DVD is so well designed.  There is a 12 minute workout, a 40 minute workout and instructions for each move that you can click on individually if you need a refresher.  I actually like that Lauren doesn't talk more than necessary.  She also doesn't have a fake smile plastered on her face.  This makes it much easier to handle with repeated viewings.  Other DVDs I have used became so irritating after a while (ahem, Jillian Michaels).  This one can be viewed again and again.  I noticed that another review said the workout is too easy.  I have been using a 15 lb kettlebell for about 6 months and have used other kettlebell workouts and I still found this challenging.",1326844800,,851,4.5394736842105265
3755058,5,B001PO7J9A,Lauren is a very good instructer.  The DVD gives you enough varity to keep your exercise needs satisfied.  She is pleasant to watch and the back ground music is nice to listen to.,1326326400,,179,4.393939393939394
3755059,4,B001PO7J9A,I underestimated this video because i did the first 12 min video with a 18lb weight and i barely broke a sweat so i thought the 40 min video would be a breeze. Mind you i do insanity and Jillian Micheal's DVDs so after the first minute of the 40 min video i thought i could be bad azz and adjust my kettle bell to 20lbs! how WRONG i was... lol. I had to go right back to 18lbs because this video is a bit difficult if you have a heavy kettle bell. And 40 min swinging a heavy weight is a LONG time i couldn't get through the whole thing which made me rethink this whole work out. All in all its a good workout and the only reason im giving it 4 stars is because i think after each exercise a 60 second break is unnecessary you kinda got to fast forward the video to make it consistent which can be annoying. Another thing is the price. Its pretty pricey but i guess your paying for a Certified Kettle bell instructor. But a good workout overall!,1326240000,3,945,4.031914893617022
3755060,5,B001PO7J9A,"This is an excellent DVD for runners.  This DVD is broken into 2 20 minute workouts, a 6 minute workout, and a 13 minute ab workout.  The first of the 20 minute workouts is called ""The Grind"".  It is a perfect workout for an easy run day.  It involves Turkish-get ups, push-ups, single leg dead lifts, one arm rows, and some squats.  The ab workout is a nice length and really works your core.  I also like the 6 minute workout.  It's called ""The Finisher"" and consists of snatches and squats done in 20 sec intervals, and it is also perfect to tack onto the end of a run.  I don't do the second 20 minute workout.  It's more intense and I don't usually have that kind of stamina after a run.  The video also includes a section giving detailed instructions on how to do each exercise if you are new to kettlebell.",1324512000,14,813,4.254901960784314
3755061,4,B001PO7J9A,"I waited for a long time to purchase this dvd because of the price and because of some of the reviews. I finally ordered it because I need variety in my workouts and frankly, there just are not that many intermediate- advanced kettlebell dvds out there. I own many and have traded in or sold a few because of lack of intensity or interest. That being said, I really am glad that I finally bought this one. The two minute workout/one minute rest format is helpful because it sets me up to work extremely hard for those two minutes. There are no fancy combinations but her form is great and I feel that I am not going to injure myself with her straitforward approach. She is not bubbly but that is fine - she is pleasant enough. The production quality is poor - the sound especially is bad. However, it does not lessen the effectiveness of the workout. Definitely recommend using a heavy bell for this one.",1323475200,2,904,4.419161676646707

Excellent workout.  I like both the short workout and the 40 minute version.  It works for quick weight loss.  It's my new fave!",1322697600,2,222,4.475
3755083,4,B001PO7J9A,"I just bought this workout DVD after doing Kettleworx for 9 weeks. Kettleworx is good, but I needed more of a challenge, so I went with this vol 1. I was able to complete the 40 min workout the first time using 15 lb kettle bell, but I was glad when it was over because I was sweating and breathing hard. The instruction is great and the production of the video is good. Lauren is straightforward and quite pleasant. Based on some of the reviews I read, I expected the video production to be like a bootleg DVD and that the music would be horrible-- not the case. Lauren is not Chalene Johnson of TurboJam fame, but that's the beauty of the kettle bells. Nothing elaborate, no big studio production, but a heck of a workout. In a month, I know I'll need to move up to another weight  to maintain the challenge or I'll have to move up to another DVD to learn some additional moves and get some variety.  I have only been doing kettle bells for 10 weeks now, but  I also do 3 hours a week of intense Zumba at a dance studio and I have lifted free weights as well although I was on hiatus due to an injury.  I say this to say, i am not new to working out. The 14 min workout would be good for a beginner who can then progress to the 40 min workout.
Only downside is that I wish I could select different segments of the 40 min workout to create my own shorter workout with the same level of intensity.",1322006400,,1397,4.106227106227106
3755084,5,B001PO7J9A,"Kettlebells is the ONLY type of weight training I can stick with, and I started with this DVD.  Only doing it 3-4 times a week, I had people asking me what I did to be so fit.  I highly recommend starting with this DVD.  It is beginner friendly and safety comes first!  Ladies, do yourself and your body, mind, and confidence (and your booty!) a favor and please skip those other fluffy kettlebell dvds.  This is the real deal!!
Also, I love the breaks in this video. I can even manage to sweep or stir something on the stove - all while working out.  LIFE saver.  Lauren, you are so awesome!
If I can do it, so can you.  I even trained through a little over half of my first pregnancy with her dvds (she has one called Baby Bells).  Just put it in your cart and proceeeeeed to checkout!  You won't regret it.",1320192000,4,809,4.194805194805195
3755085,4,B001PO7J9A,"A friend was kind enough to lend me this DVD, and I am really glad I had the opportunity to try it.  I am a high intermediate exerciser but am fairly new to kettlebells (been using them for just over a month or so).  I had heard excellent things about instructor Lauren Brooks, especially her excellent form pointers, and so I mainly wanted to take a look at this DVD to review Lauren's exercise demos and to make sure that my own form was correct.

The Main Menu for this DVD reads as follows:

INTRODUCTION
KETTLEBELL SAFETY AND SIZE
EXERCISE DEMONSTRATIONS
WORKOUTS
CONCLUSION
MORE INFORMATION

In her brief (<2 minutes) Intro, Lauren talks about how she is both a certified RKC kettlebell instructor and a clinical nutritionist.  She also introduces her long-time client, Robin Duncan, a fit woman in her 50s who joins Lauren for the workouts.  The recommendations for Kettlebell Safety and Size appear on-screen accompanied by Lauren's voiceover.  She suggests that women who are in shape start with about 15-18 lbs (up to 8kg); men can go even heavier than this.

The Exercise Demonstrations cover ALL of the moves included in the workout, which is nice.  They are short (about 1 minute each), but Lauren does do a thorough job of breaking down each movement.  Here are the exercises which are included (as they appear on the submenu, correcting for typos):

1.  Deadlift
2.  Suitcase Deadlift
3.  Two-Hand Swing
4.  One-Hand Swing & Alternating Swing
5.  Overhead Swing
6.  One Arm Clean
7.  Front Squats
8.  Kettlebell Push-Ups
9.  One Arm Rows
10. Russian Twist
11. Pullover Crunch
12. Mountain Climbers
13. Back Lunge
14. Squat Thrusts
15. High Pull, Catch & Squat

As you can see, no all of the exercises are actual kettlebell moves; Lauren incorporates some bodyweight exercises into the workouts to increase the cardio effect.  Selecting ""Workouts"" takes you to the following submenu:

JOINT MOBILITY WARM-UP
QUICK FULL BODY FAT BLAST
SCULPT AND CONDITION IN UNDER 40 MINS.

The Joint Mobility is a 6-minute segment that can be used as a warm-up for either of the two workouts.  It begins with neck, torso, and shoulder stretches.  Lauren performs a full body roll and then travels down the body to roll the hips, knees, and ankles; she finishes by rolling out the wrists and forearms.

The Quick Full Body Fat Blast is a shorter version of the main workout which can be done in about 13 minutes.  This workout is performed in one minute rounds:  you will perform two different exercises for 30 seconds each within each round, and then you will rest for 30 seconds before moving on to the next round.  Here is the breakdown of rounds:

#1:  front squat and two-hand swings
#2:  push-ups and squat thrusts
#3:  deadlifts and mountain climbers
#4:  clean, squat & press (left & right)
#4:  one-arm rows (left & right)
#6:  high pull, catch & squat plus alternating cleans plus alternating swing plus overhead swing (this round is 2 minutes)
#7:  abs cool-down:  forearm plank and Russian twist

The 40-Minute Sculpt and Conditioning Workout follows a similar pattern, but here the rounds are 2 minutes long with a 1 minute break in-between.  Also, every time you complete two rounds, you go back and perform a second set of those same two rounds.  The breakdown is as follows:

#1:  suitcase deadlift (left & right)
#2:  one-arm row (left & right) and alternating swings
Repeat 1 and 2
#3:  front squat (left & right) and clean & press (left & right)
#4:  tricep pushups plus squat thrusts and overhead swings
Repeat 3 and 4
#5:  back lunges (left & right) plus alternating cleans and mountain climbers
#6:  high pull, catch & squat plus two-hand swing and alternating swings
Repeat 5 and 6
#7:  abs cool-down:  pullover-to-crunch and Russian twist

In her Conclusion, Lauren talks about how using kettlebells helped her to get back in shape just months after her pregnancy; she is enthusiastic about the benefits of using kettlebells for anyone.

Overall, I think this DVD is generally well-done.  However, it didn't quite click with me, as there where several things I didn't like about it.  To be fair, I will list both what I did and didn't like so that others can make their own decision.

What I DID like about this DVD:
*I like that Lauren is a certified RKC instructor AND a clinical nutritionist (although the later doesn't really come up here).
*I liked the inclusion of exercise demos for all of the moves.  These were helpful, if brief.
*I liked the inclusion of two workouts, both a shorter workout (and one that was truly short!) and a longer one that was still well under an hour.
*I liked the inclusion of an older, very fit background exerciser (Robin).
*I liked the pleasant outdoor setting (it appears to be a city courtyard).

What I did NOT like about this DVD:
*I just didn't warm-up to Lauren.  I'm not sure why; she definitely seemed competent.  It may just be an age mismatch--I am nearing my mid-40s, and she appears quite young (I am guessing late 20s/early 30s).  I haven't had this problem with other young instructors, but I just found myself unable to relate to her...and wishing that her background exerciser, Robin, was leading the workout!
*This may relate to the last item--and it may just be a pet peeve of my own--but it REALLY bothered me that Lauren wears her hair loose for these workouts.  Normally this would not be an issue for me, but she has hair that is almost down to her waist, and she was constantly pushing it out of the way.  Not only did I find this to be a distraction, but also I found it to be unprofessional.
*Although I liked the inclusion of the exercise demos, they seemed a bit short and felt a bit rushed to me.  I actually preferred the exercise breakdowns by Anthony and Beth on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kettlebell-Way-To-Your-Perfect-Body-Volume-1-DVD/dp/B001T77E4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kettlebell Way To Your Perfect Body Volume 1 DVD</a>.
*Regarding the workouts themselves, I personally did NOT like the inclusion of non-kettlebell (bodyweight) exercises.  I have taken up kettlebells because I want to work with the KETTLEBELL not because I want to do the same old exercises I have seen on other DVDs for years now!  Also, working with the kettlebell provides plenty of a cardio effect on its own, so I see no need to ""thrown in"" other exercises.
*I also did not like how the same exercises were repeated in the main workout; I found this boring.  If ALL the rounds had been performed and THEN the entire set was performed again, this may have been better (most other kettlebell DVDs I have do it this way, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Core-Warrior-Volume-1-and-Volume-2-DVD-s/dp/B00355OGTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Core Warrior Volume 1 and Volume 2 DVD's</a>).
*During the rest periods, some of the on-screen messages are little ""plugs"" about Lauren's achievements.  This time could have been used to give form pointers, which is what is done in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Core-Warrior-Volume-1-and-Volume-2-DVD-s/dp/B00355OGTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Core Warrior Volume 1 and Volume 2 DVD's</a>&nbsp;workouts.
*Finally, I do not like the there is no real cool-down/stretch to finish the workout.  It seems like many kettlebell instructors skip the inclusion of a stretch at the end; obviously I can add this on myself, but I'd love to see just a few minutes of targeting stretching devoted to some of the areas which might become vulnerable during kettlebell use, such as the lower back.

I know that not everyone will agree with me, and certainly many users love this DVD.  However, if you are closer to my age and are an experienced exerciser (just new to kettlebells), you might consider purchasing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kettlebell-Way-To-Your-Perfect-Body-Volume-1-DVD/dp/B001T77E4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kettlebell Way To Your Perfect Body Volume 1 DVD</a>&nbsp;instead of this DVD.",1318118400,18,8131,5.1667941851568475
3755086,5,B001PO7J9A,"I took a one-month Boot Camp for Women.  We used Kettlebells quite a bit and I really liked using them.  When the month was over, I decided to continue on my own at home.  I bought Kettlebells from Amazon and this DVD.  There are less expensive DVD's but I couldn't be more pleased with this one.  I think Lauren is a wonderful coach.  She reminds us how to breath and she's comfortable to listen to.  I can't handle a 'Cheerleader-type' DVD instructor!  Others have reviewed the format of the DVD, so I won't repeat that.  I am 55 years old and have never enjoyed working out until being introduced to Kettlebells.  I started out 40 pounds overweight, and have lost 20 so far through working out and eating quite healthy.  I use Lauren and Kettlebells every-other day and do something else, like walking or another work-out DVD, on the in-between days. I think the best part is how fast the Kettlebell work-out gets the heart rate up.  A 12 minute work-out probably equals a half hour of other exercises!",1314316800,5,1005,4.553072625698324
3755087,5,B001PO7J9A,"I've only been doing this dvd for about three weeks being really consistent doing it two to three times a week with a 15 lb kettle bell. I was already in decent shape and eat a pretty healthy vegetarian diet. I was really looking to tone up. Even though it's only been three weeks, I swear I can already see a difference. This workout is amazing, Lauren is so fantastic at explaining how to do the moves and making sure to remind you to do them properly during the workout. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone looking to get into better shape. I can't wait to get the other two she has out!

My only critique of the dvd is the  music. It's kind of lame. But, the awesomeness of the workout makes up for it.",1314057600,4,708,4.160583941605839
3755088,5,B001PO7J9A,"I bought this video after doing quite a bit of research online. I have been using it for 3 weeks now. I wasn't sure about what weight bell to start with so I went with a 10lb that I bought at the same time as the DVD. It was good to get started, but I have already graduated to an 8kg Ader bell that I bought locally. I haven't progressed to the 40 minute portion of the DVD yet, but I feel confident that if I keep at the 12 minute I will get there. I am having quite a bit of trouble with the clean, my forearm is pretty banged up. I guess more practice is required. I haven't lost any weight yet, but I have lost 1"" from my waist. Overall I am excited about working out with this video and look forward to my daily workouts. I haven't felt that way in quite some time.",1312070400,2,771,3.8860759493670884
3755089,5,B001PO7J9A,the ultimate body sculpt and conditioning with kettlebells dvd by lauren brooks was a great purchase. She shows you all of the exercises in a separate demonstration section. you learn how to do them properly so you don't hurt yourself. the instruction is straight forward and motivating. this is not a dancey complicated workout. it is a tough heart pumping interval workout that will get you soaked. i have seen great results using this video as well as her other videos. my whole body has gotten tight and toned and i now fit into clothes i haven't worn in a while (like years). she also has a great website that is loaded with great information and motivational material. the video has 2 separate workouts. i do one or sometimes both and i also mix them with her second dvd workouts for variety. i love that i can do my cardio with weight training all in one.  when the workout starts getting easier you can increase the size of your kettlebell and increase the workout intensity.  you won't be disappointed with this purchase.,1310342400,,1030,4.653846153846154
3755090,5,B001PO7J9A,"This workout is amazing!  It has a 12 minute quick body blast workout, as well as a longer 40 minute workout.  This is in addition to a few warm-up excercises AND an option to see all the moves demonstrated before you begin.  The thing I love, love, love about this workout is that you exercise for 1-2 minutes and then get a 30 - 60 second break.  This is repeated throughout the entire workout.  When I do this workout in the bedroom, I get my clothes folded, bed made, etc., during the breaks.  In the living/dining room today, I straightened items, Windexed my glass dining room table, used the restroom, etc.  Don't get me wrong...I was sweating, breathing hard, etc. while I was doing those things.  I just thought that if I sat down, I might not get back up!  No matter how strenuous an exercise is - it's great to know that you just have to push through it because you have a break coming up within 2 minutes or less.  Today was the 2nd time I tried the 40 minute workout.  I stopped at 20 minutes, took a 5 minute break, and then resumed for the last half.  I can feel that every major muscle group in my body got a workout.  Arms, butt, legs, abs - I can feel them all!  I can't imagine ever needing another workout video, unless it's another one of Lauren Brooks'!  By the way, the first kettlebell workout I did was Jillian Michael's ""Shred-It with Weights"" DVD.  For the first time in my 38 years, I really hurt my back (for several days).  I starting reading reviews on another forum, and found that I wasn't the only one.  While I was on those forums, I learned about this DVD from others who were recommending it - most said something along the lines of - ""May cost more, but it's so worth it!""  So I took the plunge and you should too!  The only pain I feel is the muscle workout kinda pain!  That means it's working!",1310342400,3,1834,4.273255813953488
3755091,5,B001PO7J9A,This is a good workout DVD. I used this when I first started using kettlebells. I still use a light bell (10 pounds) but even the 12 minute workout gets me sweating.,1310083200,,165,4.1875
3755092,1,B001PO7J9A,"A couple of months ago I became interested in Kettlebell workouts in addition to my weekly routines of Body Pump, cycling, and yoga. ""The Ultimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning with Kettlebells"" was the second DVD I purchased for home use. I did two of the workouts, found them very boring/dull, and have not used it since. Also, some of the moves did not include using the Kettlebells which was surprising for a KETTLEBELL workout. More recently I began using the Skogg System. It rocks! Spend the extra money and you'll be glad you did.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SKOGG-System-Kettlebell-Workout-5-DVD-Set/dp/B004Q74WRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SKOGG System Kettlebell Workout 5 DVD Set</a>",1309392000,9,741,6.203883495145631
3755103,5,B001PO7J9A,"After purchasing, AND LOVING, Lauren's KB Vol. 1 DVD, I decided I had to have this one as well. I love working out with kettlebells and think Lauren is probably my favorite instructor. She is so basic and always shows great technique to follow. She gives lots of reminders on form and her workouts are just so simplistic and easy to love! In addition, these workouts will make you sweat!! I have buckets of sweat pouring off of me everytime I do them. The intensity level is high and this workout gives me a challenge each and every time, even once I felt like this workout had gotten a bit easier. I just upped the weight of my bells and the intensity level changed and I had a whole new workout again! She has a joint mobility warm-up section which I definitely recommend, and do, every time. The workout is also broken down into segments: The Grind, The Punisher, The Finisher and Ab work, making the workout customizable. For instance, I find it more beneficial to do The Punisher and Finisher followed by The Grind, even though that is not the order that they are in on the DVD. It is easy to pick and choose what segments you want to do. There is also a Cool-Down stretch at the end. I am so happy that I found this series and have worked it into my regimen 3x per week. I am seeing results that I had not seen in awhile. If you're looking for a challenging workout and haven't tried kettlebells, think about adding them to what you already do and consider Lauren's Ultimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning series.",1306022400,8,1517,4.421428571428572
3755104,5,B001PO7J9A,"With the persistent persuasion and encouragement of a good friend, I finally decided to buckle down and try kettle bells as a way to take my fitness to another level. I wasn't sure how well I would like kettlebells and was skeptical that they would be effective and that I would notice results. After much research and reading reviews from others, I decided to purchase the first 2 in the series of Lauren Brooks' Kettlebell DVD's. From the first moment I tried them, I have loved them! The workouts are challenging and I am seeing results that I had not seen in awhile. I had reached that ugly ""p"" word that we all know and hate....these kettlebell workouts have helped push me through my plateau and I could not be happier! There are currently 3 volumes in this series with Volume 1 being more basic, obviously, than the other 2. Lauren just gives you basic routines and kettlebell work in this DVD, which is perfect for beginners to kbs, but at the same time, the intensity level is up there making it challenging for someone who's not a beginner to working out. I highly recommend this DVD! As others have stated, it is not of the highest production quality, but I love the simplicity of it, which proves you don't need all the ""fluff"" some other DVDs contain in order to have an effective workout. Lauren has a very ""relaxed"" instruction style and doesn't get too excited in her DVDs but again, it is effective and I actually like the more natural approach. Nothing worse than instructors who try too hard to be motivating and it just ends up being annoying and you can hardly stand to do the routine. Once you have mastered this volume, you can move and purchase Vol. 2 in the series, which is harder and then on to Vol. 3 if you desire. Her DVDs are also broken down into segments that allow you to customize each workout to your needs. Since taking the plunge into kettlebell workouts and adding them to my weekly regimin, I do these workouts 3x a week and I am a believer in kettlebells, thanks to Lauren! I am finally seeing results again and I would have to say her videos are probably my faves! My only complaint with Lauren's DVD's are the price. They are some of the pricier ones, but if you do them and get results, it's worth it, right?!",1306022400,4,2253,4.4576271186440675
3755105,5,B001PO7J9A,"I started working out with kettlebells before I was pregnant, and used Lauren Brooks's Baby Bells DVD during my whole pregnancy. (I highly recommend that DVD for any woman who is interested in maintaining a great level of fitness during pregnancy.) After I gave birth, I emailed Lauren & asked how I could best get my body & strength back. She recommended this DVD, and I'm so glad she did! Within 3 months, I had lost all of my baby flab and gotten back to a size 6. Now, 8 months after delivering, I'm stronger and more fit than I was before pregnancy, thanks to this DVD. This DVD provides detailed instructions on all the kettlebell moves--invaluable for beginners!, a 39-minute full body workout, and a 12-minute ""fat blast."" Each workout is based on timed intervals, rather than number of reps, so you can go at your own pace. I use the 12-minute workout all the time when I don't have time to do a long routine. It's enough to help me maintain, which is all I need some days. I think that reviewers who complain about the music or a ""lack of personality"" are really just trying to find an excuse not to work out, & would rather be entertained than challenged. This is hands down the best workout DVD I have ever used; I would recommend it to anyone who's serious about being healthy & in shape.",1305763200,4,1301,4.447698744769874
3755106,5,B001PO7J9A,"Just needed to let everyone know that this is the best kettlebell dvd out there! So worth the money. Yes the music and layout might be a bit amateurish but the workouts blow that away! I have been using this dvd for the past 2 years and it is still my favorite, and it was my first intro to kettlebells! I have several other dvds but always seem to return to this one. Thank you Lauren!",1304467200,2,386,4.092105263157895
3755107,4,B001PO7J9A,I've really enjoyed using this kettlebell workout DVD. It's a tough workout but fortunately there is a short form (~12 minutes) which can be repeated for a little longer workout. There is also a much longer (~40 minute) workout which I haven't quite been able to get all the way through yet. I love the exercise demonstration and the introduction to kettlebells that is accessible from the menu.,1304294400,,395,4.823529411764706
3755108,2,B001PO7J9A,"I purchased Lauren's first kettlebell DVD and love love love it!  I was so excited for the 2nd one.  Sadly, the killer abs section was defective and kept freezing.  I sent it back for an exchange.  I received the replacement and the whole DVD is frozen!  I guess it wasn't meant to be, Lauren :-(",1303430400,2,296,4.3090909090909095
3755109,5,B001PO7J9A,"I'm in my mid 50s and decided I needed to ramp up my activity.  Kettlebells seemed to be the way to go for me, and am so glad I read the reviews and purchased this DVD.

I've never attended a KB class or had instruction, and too far to travel where it is offered.  Had studied a bit before buying my KBs (went with the contoured bells, easier for my very small hands to catch).  I feel confident with my moves following Lauren (I have a mirror set up so I can see my posture).

I am really enjoying the workouts.  I started with a 10# to get the form down, moved to my 15#, and once I build up to my 20# KB I will be moving onto her 2nd DVD.  Even after a couple of weeks I am finding a bit of toning taking place, noticing muscles I haven't felt in years, and am loving the overall sense of well being I have developed knowing that I am gaining strength and endurance. I feel confident with this video and am pleasantly ""used up"" after the 40 minute workout.

Lauren isn't known as the kettlebell queen for nothing!",1302134400,5,1016,4.0703517587939695
3755110,5,B001PO7J9A,"I bought 4 kettlebells (varying weight) and Lauren's DVDs Ultimate Sculpt volumes 1 and 2) without having worked out with KB. Having pushed aside any workout routine for the past year, I felt it was time to give KB a try.
I began working out to Lauren's Ultimate Sculpt volume 1 DVD for 12 minutes with 5lbs for 4 days the first week and 10lbs the second week to see if I could even perform the moves correctly, as I suffer from regular neck and back pain.
I find Lauren's instruction-style to be very user-friendly, especially for a beginner, and as I've progressed to my 4-week point and want something a little more demanding, Ultimate Sculpt volume 2 is fitting the bill very well. Overall, I really like Lauren's more subdued approach to exercise. I have strained my back in the past by performing strength training exercises incorrectly and Lauren's approach is slow but intense enough to make you really focus on each move being performed so that you won't injure yourself. Her exercise demonstrations are great and a must if you're a beginner; her warm-up and cool-down sessions are amazing medicine for your joints. Albeit, there are some moves that I simply cannot perform well yet (Turkish Get-Ups and pushups with KBs for fear they will turn over - I'm a clutz, too. lol!). For these moves, I either lay out or do traditional variations like regular pushups with no KBs.
Note: I did purchase a KB workout DVD from Amy Bento to break up the routine and I have to say, I honestly found her style to be almost manic. Although, my heart rate was up during the entire workout and this was great (heart rate is up with Lauren's, too), plus, some of her moves are rather challenging and provide an interesting approach to KB, her style is not my cup of tea. It's like Amy is grasping to come up with some new twisting move just to make the 20-minute mark. Lauren's style is methodic, intense and you can feel the fruit of your efforts the next day.
When I want quick and calm, I go to Lauren's Ultimate Sculpt volume 1 for a basic 12 minute workout or do it all again for a total 24 minute workout. In volume 1, Lauren's workout partner is also an inspiration, as she is either in her 40s or 50s and has a super-sculpted body thanks to KB, according to Lauren. There are three things that really appeal to me with Lauren's DVDs: her purposeful instruction, the fact that you can get a 12 minute quickie in or go full throttle with a 20 or 40 minute workout and the time cue included in each session is helpful. Also, the music is actually kind of soothing and is very appropriate to each workout session. I'm getting ready to purchase her US volume 3 today - from her website - [...]. Also, another note to add about KBs - they are great - I'm seeing a difference in only a few weeks and actually look forward to my workout, which are two major accomplishments, in my world! I'm really noticing definition in my glutes, my arms and my waistline is shrinking. I'm able to lift and carry items I was having trouble with and the best part - no more daily back or neck pain!",1300838400,42,3075,4.434628975265018
3755111,5,B001PO7J9A,"I have just started working out with kettlebells in the last month.  So I'm starting from scratch.  I purchased three other kettlebell DVDs from Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper and Paul Katami. (all instructors who I love) But this DVD is by far my favorite for a couple of reasons.  First, the instruction on the basic moves is SO CLEAR.  That was so helpful b/c if you are not doing the moves with proper form you will hurt yourself.  Having said that, it is going to take me a while to actually do the moves right, but at least I have a clear understanding of what I should be doing.  Both the 12min and 40min workout fly by.  I found the production quality to be very good and I really liked Lauren's teaching style.  She gives you all the information you need without being annoying and fake.  Since I plan on doing this (and the other) DVDs in the collection a lot I really appreciate that.  I feel like I can focus on the workout much better that way.  I also like the way the moves are broken down (2min workout 1min rest).  At first I thought that is wasn't going to be a workout that flowed or kept up my heart rate, but that is not the case at all.  I'm working just as hard as other DVDs but I feel like I'm able to do each of the exercises with much better form b/c I'm not rushing between moves.  IMO this is much safer especially for a beginner.  Having said that, as I get stronger and use heavier kettlebells this workout will continue to be just as challenging. On the DVD Lauren mentions that if you want a workout routine feel free to email her.  I did and to my delight (and quite honestly surprise)  she responded very fast and sent a detailed email with routines for the weeks to come.  I'm super impressed.  This workout was worth every penny and I'm looking forward to incorporating Vol. 2 and the Workshop DVD.",1299024000,11,1833,4.291545189504373
3755112,5,B001PO7J9A,"For years I've searched for a workout routine I like enough to keep doing. Countless DVDs, many dollars wasted...until now. This one is so fantastic, I want to do it every day, or even twice a day.

Don't let the cover fool you--this is a serious, professional DVD well worth the money, time and effort.

I was looking for something short, 10-15 mins, as I have little time for exercise. This DVD offered a 12-min workout, so I thought  okay, I could grit my teeth and get through 12 minutes.

Another thing is having to very carefully watch my knees, as they were seriously stressed teaching figure skating for nearly a decade. Now they're painful going up & down stairs.

Well, the gritting-teeth never happened, and somehow even the squats don't bother my knees. This workout's FUN! Which is not to say it's not hard work, but in a good way. When I finish I feel thoroughly worked-out but it was so much fun I want to do it again. On the off days, since I'm doing an every-other-day schedule, I find myself longing to do the workout again as well.

Lauren's no-nonsense style is just perfect for me. I cannot bear the ""cheerleader"" types bouncing all over with wide grins on their perky little faces. Lauren encourages without all the gimmicky rah-rah found on so many workout DVDs. Her RKC form is excellent, which is exactly what I wanted. If I'm going to work out with a kettlebell, I want to do it right.

In a separate section of the DVD, Lauren demonstrates every exercise with proper form. Here is where to practice it before trying the workouts. I really love her technique for the clean, which minimizes forearm-banging (read: bruising if you do it wrong). Super.

The music is nonintrusive, very pleasant. The countdown timer in the corner of the screen is really helpful. As other reviewers have noted, having a 50+ year old workout partner in fantastic shape helps encourage those of us no longer in our 20s.

Check out Lauren's blog on her website ontheedgefitness.com and read the story of the young woman with MS who used Lauren's kettlebell program to go from bedridden to doing a 40-min intense kbell workout in TWO months -- truly amazing.

I really cannot say enough about this fabulous DVD. At first I balked at the price, but let me tell you it's absolutely worth it. I've never paid so much for a DVD, but I will definitely be buying her Vol 2 and 3 when I advance that far. This one will keep me busy awhile -- in only a week or so I lost 6 lbs without changing my eating habits. (Except now I do consider more carefully: do I want to negate all that fabulous kbell work by eating this? Nope!) Already I feel firm muscles in my obliques and legs, and overall I feel so much better. This is coming from a desk-job single mom with 50 lbs to shed.

One tip: Try to get the best kbell you can buy. Some have rough handles that will tear your hands, and the concrete or sand ones are pure crap. At the moment I have a kbell from Sports Authority, which is okay, but I'm ordering a Lifeline kbell (recommended by Lauren) because I want optimal results.

I have found incorporating the two as Lauren recommends has been really great giving me fast results over a short period of time.

3755126,1,B001PO7J9A,"After all the great reviews I read I was very excited.  The workout is tough but repetitive.  She as an instructor is pretty dull.  And with her credentials I was hoping for more cues on alignment and safety.  I get that this is vol. 2 but for me as an instructor myself, I never take for granted that people need reminders on those things.  Afterall isn't that what ""instructing"" is all about.  Not just showing moves like a dancer would but explaining them, pointing out muscles being used, and always safety reminders!  She never once cued breathing which is crucial to kettlebells and never cued a pulled in abdominal wall for back safety.  Maybe once she mentioned packing the shoulder girdle.  It looked very ""made in the garage"" in quality and sound.  I am thinking of returning it.",1296172800,13,789,4.6521739130434785
3755127,5,B001PO7J9A,"Sept 2011.  I wanted to explore kettlebell since having back surgery (the vertibrae is bone-on-bone). I know it is important to develop a strong core to help from repeating any future back problems.

I am 51 years old, an avid swimmer and I even teach safe exercise to people over 65 years of age. With that said, safety is always a key requirement for me to any DVD exercise video especially to body's that do ultimately change with age.

There were two DVDs on kettlebell that I have tried recently and would like to give a review on both.

Angie Miller's ""Kettlebell Bootcamp"" was the first that I purchased. It was a good workout that made me sore every time that I did them, but for me there were just too many lunges (bad knees).  With safety in mind, I would rate this a 3.

The second DVD I purchased was Lauren Brooks' ""The Ultimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning with Kettlebells"". Lauren is a Certified Instructor of Russian Kettlebell and you feel like you are in a private session (no frills to this video). She gives wonderful instruction on what is most important to me proper form and safety. Her DVD is broken up into a 12-minute workout, which can be repeated for a second or third set. Then there is a 40-minute workout. I like Lauren's style and instruction. There are no lunges...just squats. If you want proper form and safety I would recommend this highly. On a scale of 1-5, I would rate this tops.

Update Report 1/2/2012.  After doing Lauren's 12-minute and 40-minute DVDs for 4-months, I have to report that I do not feel any athritic stiffness in my back after rising from 8-hours of sleep.  My vertibrae is bone-on-bone, and I truly believe that KB is stregthening my multifidus and other stabilizers critical to support a weakend vertibrae.  I'm a KB convert for life.",1294531200,102,1796,4.601880877742946
3755128,1,B001PO7J9A,"This is not a good workout if you have been working out regularly for years. This is very simple, slow and it will not challenge you at all. This should be rated easy and would be very good for new exercisers only.",1292112000,6,214,4.119047619047619
3755129,5,B001PO7J9A,"I spent weeks researching a great kettlebell intro dvd and found out that there are very few on the market.  There are even fewer if you are looking for a dvd which utilizes proper Russian Kettlebell technique.  I found several ""kettlebell-aerobic"" dvds, but realized that the majority of the instructors on those dvds are not certified Russian Kettlebell Trainers.  Lauren Brooks is RKC certified, has a BS in Exercise Science and is a certified clinical nutritionist.
Some of the critical reviews complain about the cinematography.  However, I wasn't bothered by this because I was too busy working up a sweat working out!  I was mainly concerned about the workout content.  No doubt-Lauren is a great trainer and the workout is awesome!
Others complained about all the ""breaks"" in-between the movements- this is called HIGH INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING.  The breaks are on purpose and are proven to increase your metabolism.  If you don't NEED a break in-between the movements the weight you are using is too light!
One of the most helpful things on this DVD is the intro.  Lauren goes through all the different movements with proper techinique.  That is something very important since you are swinging a 15 lb kettlebell with bare feet!  Kettlebells should be done on bare feet so that you can stablize better.  I am a petite woman and I think a 10lb kettlebell would have been too light.  They say you should choose a kettlebell that you can't lift/press more than a handful of times, otherwise it will be too light and the workout won't be as effective.",1290988800,44,1558,4.8783269961977185

If you lift heavy things ( me my two 35 pound children)I wouldn't get anything smaller than a 15lb bell but do what you feel would be best for you.

3755138,4,B001PO7J9A,"First, a little background on my fitness level:  I hate exercising but force myself to do it for at least 20 minutes a day, 40 minutes max. At my peak, I would jog/walk 2 miles a day and then do some stretching or light weights (5-10lb dumbells)... or I would go on my elliptical for 30-40 minutes. very boring. My BMI was probably around 20. I often tend to have an exercise routine for 3-6 months and then go off of it for 3-6 months.

For some reason I like to read fitness blogs. My favorite is Josh Hillis ([...]) and that's how I learned about kettlebells and Lauren Brooks.

Now for my review. I started with the 12 minute fat blast workout... I couldn't even get through the whole thing. I was seriously dying.  There's this one part where you do clean-squat-press and I could barely get that 20lb bell over my head.  I really had to thrust it up from the squat. At one point I tried doing the 40 minute workout and you have to do overhead presses... I definitely couldn't do it... so I kept with the 12 minute workout. I would do this 3 x week and go walking. After a few weeks I was able to do this workout twice in a row for a 24 minute workout. I'm always always aaaalways drenched in sweat! After that I decided to go for the 40 minute workout. I would skip using the bell for the squats and lunges sections because otherwise it's TOO killer.  I think I've only made it through the entire workout a handful of times. BUT I CAN do the overhead presses now (with ease!) and I can tell that my body is toning up. I think I've gained weight since starting this DVD... but hopefully it's muscle!

I've been doing the 40 minute workout exercises but instead of repeating each one twice, I just skip and do them all just once... its like the 12 minute fat blaster except it's around 20 minutes and more challenging.

When I got the DVD in the mail, it looks like it was made from her home computer. The music, the graphics... it all looks low quality. But the workouts themselves are HIGH HIGH HIGH QUALITY STUFF. I love that timer bar on the side so I know how much I have left to suffer. All in all, it's really fun because I feel strong and it's makes me focus (so I don't go throwing my kettlebell into the wall).

Oh and at one point I emailed Lauren and asked her how many calories are burned in the workouts... she estimated between 400-800 for the 40 minute workout depending on various factors.",1279065600,36,2409,4.253829321663019
3755139,5,B001PO7J9A,"Being a fan of Lauren Brook's first kettlebell workout DVD, I had to buy this one when it came out.  It definitely does not disappoint.  Lauren kicks up the intensity a bit with this DVD and includes some new moves such as the Turkish Get-Up.  I have always been intimidated by this move because it seemed complicated, but like her last DVD, Lauren includes an instruction section where she explains most of the exercises.  After following her step-by-step instructions, I can now do a Turkish Get-Up!
There are three short work-outs on the DVD: The Grind, The Smoker, and The Finisher.  All of these names are quite appropriate.  There is also a joint mobility warm-up, a tough ab section, a short cool-down as well as the previously mentioned instruction section.  In my opinion, this justifies the price for this DVD.
The production value is a little spotty in some areas.  This doesn't bother me at all because the workout is so incredible.",1277424000,26,944,4.783950617283951

I workout on a regular basis, so already do strength and cardio training, but for some reason Kettlebells looked too scary.  I am so happy I got this video.  When I first saw Lauren, my thought was ""here we go, little miss young georgeous person is going to turn me right off, and I'm never going to watch this again"".  After putting my jealousy aside, I continued to watch.  Lauren was easy to understand, and then introduced a woman who is on the video with her, and is in her 50's.  Good move!  If she can do it, I can for sure.  Lauren is a great instructor, and really cares. I was pretty sore from the first workout, but loved every minute of it. Another bonus, I really liked the fact that you can do it with bare feet, which I prefer since I'm a yoga instructor.  Give yourself time to get the moves down right.  It does take some coordination.  It's a great way to work out the whole body in a very short amount of time.  Don't be afraid all you women over 50.

3755153,5,B001PO7J9A,"This workout is definitely not for the faint of heart.  First, people who are just starting to get in shape, this workout will be too hard for you.  This is not to say that it can be achieved with alot of hard work though.  First, you must have a relatively strong core and work out regularly.  If you have never done kettlebell workouts before then I highly recommend that you watch the instruction segment on the video so that you can do the exercises correctly.  The instructions are very good and I felt like if I had not watched the instruction portion then I could have easily fallen into a trap of doing the workouts incorrectly and possibly been injured.

Lauren is not the type of instructor who is jumping up and down and talking nonstop, but honestly, I don't see how a kettlebell workout is designed for that type of instruction.  First, it's even hard to talk while swinging a 15-20 pound weight over your head for a minute straight.  Lauren is definitely no-nonsense and you can tell that she is not one of these Hollywood type fake instructors.  She truly cares about being in shape and helping others reach their goals.

The full workout is about 40 minutes long with one minute breaks in between.  Other reviewers have complained about the one minute break being too long.  If you are just starting this workout, then believe me, it will not be too long as each segment gets significantly harder.  Even so, if you feel like the one minute is too long, then fast forward through it.  I usually grab a drink of water and fast foward through the last 30 seconds or so to begin the next segment.  As far as the workouts themselves, they are not too difficult (moves-wise) and with practice you will be doing them like a pro.

This is definitely my number one kettle bell workout. I searched for a good kettlebell workout and this is by and far the best, instruction and workoutwise!  It has increased my strength and and each segment gets my heart a pumpin'.  Also, if you feel that it is getting too easy, increase the weight of the kettlebell and it will be just like starting over - you will be surprised at how much harder five pounds makes the workout.  Lauren uses a 35 pound kettlebell - 20 pounds is about all I can handle, but wow, I can't imagine how I would be rockin it if I could do a 35 pound bell.  There is always something to work towards with this workout!",1271635200,22,2387,4.431192660550459
3755154,5,B001PO7J9A,This DVD is a terrific way to learn the basics of kettlebells and then how to work the various exercises into a credible workout.,1267660800,2,129,4.416666666666667
3755155,5,B001PO7J9A,Lauren Brooks knows her stuff and presents it well. By sharing her story about her pregnancy and having a 50 plus training partner she shows us all that it's never too late to get in great shape. The ancedotes/factoids shown as subtitles during rest periods give additional inspiration and background.,1267056000,6,301,5.04
3755156,5,B001PO7J9A,"This is the first kettlebell workout that I have done. I was really impressed with her introduction to the moves, very clear on form. You definitely have to get your form down or you can really hurt yourself on these moves. I did the 40 minute workout and it was tough. 2 minutes on and 1 minute rest in between. It's nice because she has a running time meter on the side so you know how much longer you have to go for each segment. This workout is really worth it.",1266710400,11,465,4.1208791208791204
3755157,5,B001PO7J9A,"I love this video. The 12 minute workout kept me busy for a month and 2 months later, the longer workout is still helping! Ms Brooks does an excellent job teaching here. My personal preference is music that's a little more rock/Tiesto and a little less hyper techno, but this is not a high budget production, so I'm not expecting the perfect music for a huge audience. People forget sometimes that there's a cost in that, and things like market research involved with choosing music with a large company involved. This music is simple techno pop and fine for what it is.
The scenery is beautiful with great sunlight. You can see this genre of workout puts Ms Brooks and her partner in great shape. They look natural and fit, which is something I don't see everywhere.
This is a good investment and a great introduction to a great way to work out and develop both endurance and functional strength. I am sure that her videos will get better and better. She has a fan in me.",1266537600,5,972,4.497175141242938
3755158,4,B001PO7J9A,"**4/30/11 - Update: I'm still doing this workout. I mix it up with my other videos. I just did my first 50K bike ride and whooped my husband's behind, and I definitely credit kettlebells. The stamina you get from just swinging a bowling ball around is tremendous. - end of update**

This workout is terrific for anyone just starting out with kettlebells, although more seasoned users will certainly get a powerful blast from this DVD. However, this workout is not for beginners to fitness! You should already be working out regularly and have basic cardio and muscular (particularly core) fitness before doing this. I've been doing Jillian Michaels DVD's for close to a year now, and I'm finding this workout quite a challenge. The great thing about it is that once you master your form and build your strength, you can move up to a heavier kettlebell. As of now, I'm doing the 15lb. bell.

I love the demonstration segment. Lauren goes through the moves methodically so you can follow along and get the form right. Then there are 2 workouts: a 12 minute blast, and a 40 minute workout. Both are great. I do the 40 minute one. In between high-intensity segments there is a 60 second rest, which you can use to either really rest and get some water or do some light cardio like jumping jacks or running in place. By the middle of the workout, you'll appreciate the rests!

Some have complained about Lauren's personality. She's very matter-of-fact and she is not here to entertain you, she is here to give you a good workout. Which she does. I personally like not having to listen to the same stupid jokes over and over again or be forced to endure a false bubbly personality at 6 in the morning. Lauren gives you straight-up workout moves with solid form. I appreciate her use of a 50+ yr. old woman as workout buddy, she should be a huge inspiration for any woman, she looks better than a lot of gals in their 20's. Thanks to Lauren and Kettlebells!

My only complaints - It seems I have to restart from the beginning each time I play this DVD in our Playstation. Not a huge deal, as you're not forced to watch a whole bunch of nonsense like other DVD's. Also, I think the brightly colored, scroll-y design used on the DVD wrapper and the graphics in the video look amateur-ish. When I received the DVD, I took one look at it and thought ""Oh no, poor production inside!"" I'm a designer so I notice these things. I also think the hip-hop music used in the intro is silly. However, the music during the workout proves to not be nearly as annoying.",1266364800,43,2546,4.516268980477223
3755159,5,B001PO7J9A,"I love kettlebells and used to have a trainer that would incorporate them.  This dvd is fantastic, free of flashy graphics or annoying music and Lauren Brooks is clear, uber-helpful, and very easy to follow.  I was skeptical about the length of the breaks at first (60 seconds) between circuits, but you need them!  I checked my heart rate during those breaks and it was consistently between 150-160 bpm, which is ideal for fat-blasting cardio.  I love this dvd and I'm so glad I purchased it.  It is well worth the price- my personal trainer was way more than that per hour. :)",1265328000,9,578,4.572815533980583
3755160,5,B001PO7J9A,"I am new to the Kettlebell, but not new to working out. I've accumulated
hand weights 3 lb to 15 lbs - leg press machine, leg extension/curl machine,
various dvd's.  I decided to try the Kettlebells, and WOW what a workout.
I wish I had found this earlier.  I looked at other dvd's on the market for
kettlebell workout and decided on Lauren's.  She is a excellent instructor, with
form and technique. She has a subtle way about her instructions, not alot of talking or screaming.  I am using a 15 lb and am totally exhausted at the end of the
workout. One pc of equipment to workout your total body. Excellent. The dvd is mixed
with the kettlebell workout  and different aerobic type moves to get your heart raised even higher, and I welcome that one minute rest.  You can do jumping jacks, jump rope, or anything at your disposal during the minute if you want. But by the mid to end you will just take the minute to catch your breath.  I mentioned the reason I choose Lauren's DVD.  This is all she does, Kettlebell.  She is not following a trend.",1261094400,10,1048,4.38860103626943

3755162,5,B001PO7J9A,"I am new to kettlebells and this DVD has made me a KB addict!! The DVD is simple and straight forward with excellent instruction and proper form technique. There is nothing fancy or frilly about this DVD...just a kick-butt workout. If done properly, you will be burning hundreds of calories in just 45 minutes. And when you are short on time, there is a 12 minute, sweat-inducing express workout.
Nice job Lauren...very impressive!!",1251158400,10,432,4.931506849315069
8334034,4,B001PO7J9A,"I really enjoy this DVD, I think it is very organized, with the introduction and how she goes into each exercise.  Her technique is very precise and impressive.  For the life of my I can not pop my hips like she does.  I love the 40 minute work out, it is very challenging and if it starts to get easy I can always go up in weight.  Right now I am doing 20 pounds and I sweat and my hurt is pounding.  I think the 60 second breaks are too long so I take what is needed and skip to the next exercise.  The quicker work out is nice too, with different exercises, I chose to do that one twice.  I do not find her boring, the DVD has no frills no fancy background no fancy outfits, just two ladies working out.  I look forward to working out and the time flies by.  My only complaint is not with Lauren it is with the DVD, when stopping I wish it would start from where you left off not from the beginning.  Other then that i am very happy with the work out DVD.  I will try her other DVDs as well.",1499299200,,994,3.8955223880597014

8334040,5,B001PO7J9A,"A great workout.  I already owned Volume 1 and after purchasing this one, I will definitely purchase Volume 3 as well.",1467676800,,118,4.619047619047619
8334041,5,B001PO7J9A,"Although I appreciate that many reviewers gave a description of the length of the segments in the video along with the length of the  break periods and the ""lame"" music . What I, along with many other prospective buyers would like to know,  does thus provide results? Level of difficulty? So having said that here are my two-cents on the matter.
I bought an 18 lb kettlebell which is what Lauren/breaking muscle recommends women should be able to start with. If you can't do the 18lb start a little lighter but this is not an endurance video. It should be challenging and at first you may not be able to do all the reps but that's part of building muscle, therefore burning fat. You have to fatigue the muscles. She combines weight training with HIIT or circuit intervals, Hense the breaks in between. This form of exercise has proven to be the most effective fat burning form of exercise. I would encourage people to be more aware of inches lost rather than lbs on the scale. So measure before u begin this workout journey. The second and probably the most important is diet. You have to be mindful of what you are putting in your body. The 80/20 is probably the most realistic approach since we are human and enjoy a slice of pizza occasionally.  The is a very effective workout and will deliver results. Review her form instruction at the beginning of the video for safety.
This video can be done by a beginner. It is difficult at first and i didn't finish all the reps but have worked up to pushing through the entire thing. Focus on form and the reps will come. The price isn't that much if you consider what a gym membership costs. This type of body weight exercise along with the kettlebell will go way beyond any machine at the gym. I have had GREAT results using this video 3 times a week and on the other 2-3 days I use Bob Harper's totally ripped core!!! Another excellent video.
Hope this was helpful!!",1465344000,3,1914,4.478510028653295
8334042,3,B001PO7J9A,"Really good workout, but I LOVE UBSC Volume 1 much better. Didn't like the music in this one as much. I REALLY LOVE the Finisher Tabata workout, the Smoker workout and the warm-up/cool-down on this DVD. The reason I gave this 3 stars, is because I don't like some of the exercises in the Grind workout or the abs section, nor the music, except for the music in the Finisher (VERY DYNAMIC AND FUN). I'll be looking out for more good stuff from Lauren though.",1460246400,,457,4.3882352941176475
8334043,5,B001PO7J9A,"After trying Lauren's Shut Up & Train (good), reviewing Ultimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning with Kettlebells Volume 2 in its entirety (pretty good), Kettlebell Body (pretty good) and reviewing clips of her other DVDs, I MUST say that Ultimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning with Kettlebells Volume 1 takes the cake! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT. Lauren Brooks has really done well with this one! The irony is, this I believe, was her first DVD and yet in my opinion, is her ABSOLUTE BEST ONE YET. Love the breakdown of all the moves included in this DVD, love the 12 minute Fat Blast (13 minutes really) for when you're short on time and the 40 minute workout for those days you REALLY wanna kill it! I've done this 40 minute workout with my 25 lb kbell and it challenged me GREATLY, but I got through it several times, SUCCESSFULLY. For those days when I'm just a little tired from a restless night's sleep, I just use my 20 lb. **Tip: When doing the 12 minute Fat Blast, I suggest using nothing less than a 25 lb, as you'll get more of a challenge and feel like you've got a great workout. Also, I've even done the 12-13 minute workout twice, back to back for a total of 26 minutes, not including the 6 minute warm-up, for a total of 32 minutes, which is still 14 minutes less than the 40 minute workout, not including the warm-up, which brings it to about 46 minutes total. All in all, this UBSC Volume 1 is my absolute favorite kettlebell workout DVD of all time! And I've searched high and low, off and on for the last 4-5 years and tried many of them! Another thing, I love, love, love that you get the best of both worlds with this DVD in my opinion - KETTLEBELL AND INTERVAL TRAINING IN ONE WORKOUT. Now how great is that? Not to mention the music is pretty nice. Btw, Lauren's Kettlebells for Women Workout Book is really good too. I just like to workout to a DVD better. This DVD will go with me when I travel too! Great, great work, Ms. Brooks!",1459036800,6,1946,4.3489010989010985
