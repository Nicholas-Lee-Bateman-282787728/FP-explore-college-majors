8660614,5,B00KPI18ZS,"Otar Ioseliani is a wonderful Georgian Director. He has his own very special cinematographic language which you will always recognize if you watch his films once. His first films were made in Soviet time in Republic of Georgia (""Once upon a Time There Lived a Singing Blackbird"" and some others). Then he emigrated to France and ""Favorites of the Moon"" was the first film which he made there. It is a very special comedy with such a nice ""Georgian"" humor transferred to French background.
