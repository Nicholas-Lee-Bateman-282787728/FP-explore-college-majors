I LIKE ALL OF HIS WORK AND HAVE MANY CD'S AND SOME DVD'S  IF YOU WANT MY OPINION YOU ACCEPT WHAT I WRITE OR DO WITHOUT...I NOT FILLING WORD QUOTAS",1359849600,,187,4.166666666666667
3739778,1,B001P729XI,"I am always looking for insight and wisdom. But if you apply any critical thinking whatsoever to this program, it simply vanishes as nothing but vapor.",1353628800,4,151,4.846153846153846
3739779,2,B001P729XI,"I was really dissapointed in this DVD,it was not what I had anticipated. I had expected more up to date information from Greg Braden. These workshop Dvds are really old. Dragged on for too long. I think that the information is out of date.",1322697600,,239,4.454545454545454
3739780,5,B001P729XI,"If you didn't get a LOT out of these two DVD's, then it was over your head, and a waste of your time.

I rented the two DVD's on Netflix and got so much out of them, I'm going to now buy them so I can watch them again and again! He is so intense, and has a very unique way of seeing things! His DVD's are so much better than his books, as you can feel a sense of his strong belief is everything he says. You can see the sincerity in his eyes. As a Spiritualist, I am in awe of this man.",1287792000,7,486,3.6285714285714286
3739781,5,B001P729XI,"I am actually totally fascinated with all this. I've gotten a lot from reading Carolyn Myss, Marianne Williamson, A Course in Miracles, Gary Renard, Michelle O'Donnell, etc. and viewing several Gregg Braden videos.  This video has given me a lot to think about ... a TON of intriguing questions and thoughts, and some possible techniques (Essene mirrors) to explore further. Not a ""how-to"" book, more a way to plant the seeds of some new ideas(new to me!)

I don't know anything much about Essene mirroring or indigenous spirituality, but i didn't need to know much to enjoy the references and stories, and my lack in this area didn't lessen my excitement or joy in viewing this DVD.

I frankly loved that Gregg illustrated his themes with personal stories ... it made them more clear to me. I had a few remarkable insights just watching this the first time tonight. For example: how we viewed our parents or primary caregivers (or even lack of them) when we were children, how we view them now, how this expresses itself in our adult relationships, and how we view God (and if we do).  I even shed a few tears AND was totally stunned and awestruck at one point.

p.s. Clay Aiken rules!! :)",1278460800,13,1190,4.647619047619048
3739782,2,B001P729XI,"Braden is like that super sweet friend of yours that you can only take in small doses. And yet this is like having that friend stay in your house for a month. His overall message has some value, but it's delivered in an unfocused, self-indulgent matter - with long personal anecdotes and very little historical or scientific support. Hmmm... perhaps he's ""mirroring"" one of my own faults?

This film communicates like a therapy session, rather than a workshop on spirituality or science. My preference is the latter.",1267315200,3,516,4.931034482758621
3739783,3,B001P729XI,"I find that this video is typical of Braden's work.  For the first part, the material seems somewhat irrelevant, as if he's not focused on the material, or not very clear on what it is that he wants to convey.  But Braden is sincere and genuinely wants to help people.  What I found so valuable came in the second half, the teachings of the seven Essene Mirrors of Reflection.  If you are very interested in self-transformation towards the Enlightenment Game, then this part is worth the cost of the product.  I could not find this material anywhere, and his examples for how these reflections work in the human psyche were excellent.  Putting them into practice, I have found them to be right on mark.",1219017600,2,702,4.620967741935484
3739784,5,B001P729XI,"This DVD was professionally filmed and offers insights to the Essene Mystery School teachings of the mirrors of relationships and compassion.
One of the seven mirrors tell us how our relationship with our parents is in fact our relationship with God and the Earth.  Another tells us what we have given or had someone take away from us in our lives.
The four hour classroom setting is filled with multimedia teaching and articulate direction.
When going through what some call ""the dark night of the soul""  these teachings were my life raft.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone needing direction or healing in their life in combination with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-Zero-Point/dp/B000S0WDFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond Zero Point</a>
Gregg Braden is a head above the other author/presenters when it comes to teaching concepts.  Well worth the investment since the book is no longer available.

8332218,5,B001P729XI,"I have the original VHS version and the book.  I've been hoping this would be released on DVD.  Now I wait, because it is currently sold out.  Not a surprise, since I think Walking Between the Worlds is among Gregg's best works.  The person who said it does not hold up to ""critical thinking"" should define ""critical thinking.""  The Essene Mirrors alone make this a true exercise in critical thinking in a very personal way.  Understanding oneself and humankind is the key to a better life and a better world.",1436572800,,509,4.6

8332225,3,B001P729XI,"I love the information demonstrating the converence of science and spiritual matters that Gregg Braden brings, but had I known that this dvd is from a seminar held in the late 80's or early 90's I would not have purchased it. I feel a bit hood-winked. Additionally, I had a diffult time really listening to the message due to the props on the stage.  Especially the ""picture"" of Jesus. This is simply too impertinent; especially, considering the people groups (the yellow, the black, the brown, and the red) who maintained these ancient documents through the ages.",1360022400,3,564,4.875
