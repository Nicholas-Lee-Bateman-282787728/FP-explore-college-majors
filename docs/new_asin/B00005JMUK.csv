1511717,3,B00005JMUK,"Excellent performances from both female leads, but be prepared for one of the most depressing films of 2003.
Theron portrays a prostitute serial killer, but as we learn, she became this way because she was nearly killed herself by a client.  It became a habit for her, and obviously she enjoyed killing people.  Ricci portrays her lover, but I felt her character became annoying as the film went on. I'll always think of Ricci in the Addams Family.
The transformation of Theron from Hollywood bombshell to downright ugly is incredible. Amazing what make-up can do to people these days.
An interesting film, but is far from being the masterpiece it has been hailed as.",1086048000,3,667,4.842105263157895
1511718,4,B00005JMUK,"Monster is a movie that supports Hannibal Lecter's observation that monsters aren't born, they are made that way out of years of systematic abuse.  We sympathize with Aileen, the central character of Monster, even though we cannot forgive what she does.  That's OK - she can't forgive herself, either.
This movie has gotten a little lost in controversy.  First is Charlize Theron's Oscar-winning performance as Aileen.  She definitely did deserve the award.  Then there was the issue of how factually-correct the film is.  Although this movie is ""based on a true story"" I always take that proclamation with a grain of salt - any film version of anything will change things for dramatic purposes.
Controversy aside, Monster is a GOOD film.  We get enough sensationalized movies about serial killers - this is a film that shows what one really might be like.  It is not pretty.  Christina Ricci gives another great performance as Aileen's lover.  This film is not a boring, preachy melodrama - it is a fascinating character study of people on the fringes of society.  Also, it has a surprisingly GREAT soundtrack which the director uses to create many lyrical moments.  Highly recommended.",1085616000,3,1187,5.030769230769231
1511719,3,B00005JMUK,"I followed this case with studied interest at the time events portrayed in the film were actually happening and there are several problems with it's approach and content. Aileen was not our first female serial killer. The histories of England and America history are full of women who have killed a number of victims before being caught, tried, and executed.  This one just used a gun and did her killing in the age of television and and ""Entertainment Tonight"" style news reporting. I believe the writer and director wanted to partially excuse her behavior because she claimed to be abused. If you care enough to investiate the backgrounds of most all antisocial killers you can find evidence of childhood abuse. The problem is in our culture. We do not attempt to excuse the behavior of abused men, only abused women. The statements made about violent ""johns"" were recanted when Aileen testified requesting that her appeals be dropped. Charlise Theron gained some weight, wore false teeth, and learned to grab her crotch in her attempt to portray a basically nasty, stupid, mentally deficient lesbian who hated men enough to to take their money and kill them. Strike 1-Aileen put her faith in Tyria Moore and made a valient attempt to protect a woman who wanted nothing more than to save her own butt. Strike 2- she put her life in the hands of a guitar strumming lawyer who was w-a-y out of his league taking on any death penalty case let alone six!. Strike 3- she was then legally  adopted by a Florida woman who became involved simply to get her 15 minutes in the spotlight and make whatever money she could. She tried to extort $10,000 from a British documentary crew who wanted to tell Aileen's story in a more balanced mannor. When it became clear that they wouldn't pay and there was nothing in it for her this woman became invisible.  Aileen was a very immature, angry woman.  Her choices got her killed and Charlise got an Academy Award. Bravo, what a message! I have been very successful in past years at picking Academy Award winners. This is my secret: I assess the liberal causes the Hollywood elite wants to champion in any given year and then evaluate which films and roles might win movie watchers to their points of view. Voila! Those involved with the production of ""Monster"" sought to show that women who go wrong are usually abused by some man and were it not for that all would have been a-ok a-n-d that this was somehow...unfair for poor Aileen.  There was no stand taken about the immorality of lesbianism or prostitution (except for the hypotheses that these guys kinda got what they deserved for entertaining a hooker to begin with). Aileen was a filthy looser who killed a bunch of people and got executed for it.  Why does that rate the Hollywood treatment? Save your awards and dvd money for more deserving projects.",1085356800,12,2846,4.716297786720322
1511720,5,B00005JMUK,"Let me preface this by saying that ""Monster"" is in my opinion the best film of 2004, but it may also be one of the most infuriating for me personally.  You see, as a fairly unattractive human being, it's always bothered me when gorgeous people have complained about not being taken seriously, and I guess I never really thought that this was a concern of Charlize Theron's.  I mean, she's always been one of the sexiest actresses in Hollywood, and extremely capable in guilty-pleasures like ""The Italian Job"" and ""Reindeer Games"" (yes, I really liked that movie).  But the one thing we, the average-looking people of Earth, have always had on her and her kind, was that we made really great, gritty, personal films.  Now, though, even that's being taken away from us.  With this movie, she, along with writer/director Patty Jenkins, have taken our last bastion of usefulness.  Soon we'll all be expendable...
I write this in jest, of course, but her performance truly is exceptional, and not just because of the physical transformation, which in my opinion has slightly overshadowed just how remarkable her embodiment of the character really is.  This is one of ""those,"" and by those, I mean something that simply can't be put into words. Oh, and by the way, the movie ain't bad either.
How good is it?  Let me tell you a brief story.  I walked nearly two miles in twenty-below windchills to see this film the first day of it's release in Toledo.  And as I settled into my seat, beginning to warm up, all I could think about was how miserable the walk home was gonna be (I'd have to cover the same distance, only this time without the sunlight).  But soon thereafter, the projector began to roll, and as the movie started, everything else just seemed to fade away.  I was hooked.  I sat riveted to my seat, and never once thought about the long trek home, or any other external factor for that matter.  Wanna know what's more impressive?  When I finally did get around to leaving the theater to head home, I didn't even notice how cold it was.  I just kept replaying the movie in my head, over and over again.  Some scenes are just that unforgettable.
For example, the ""Judas"" scene, as I've come to dub it.  We all know that it's coming, at least anyone familiar with law enforcement does, yet when it happens, somehow it manages not lose a bit of it's potency or power.  Now that's filmmaking!  The camera pans, we see a shadow on the wall, and suddenly the betrayal becomes hauntingly clear.
Having said that, you may ask, ""What are the film's faults,"" and I'd be naive to deny that there aren't some, the most obvious of which being that Aileen, as portrayed in this film, comes off as entirely too sympathetic.  I was with her every step of the way and, though I already knew the outcome, was still hoping for the happy ending I knew was never going to come.  Whose fault is this, you ask?  The answer might surprise you.
Christina Ricci.  That's right, the little girl from ""The Adams Family"" is the linchpin of this film.  It's only because of her, and the way she's able to make us, the audience, fall in love with her, that we're able to understand, and even empathize with Aileen.  I can even pinpoint the exact moment that this happens.  It's as the couple, Aileen and Selby (Ricci), rollerblade to a 80's rock ballad, a song that I never really cared for, but having seen it in the context of this film have come to appreciate (not unlike Martin Scorsese's brilliant knack for taking so-so pop songs and making them transcend their cheesiness).  But getting back to ""the moment,"" Charlize looks deep into her big, brown eyes, the music swells, and that's it.  She had me, and so did this film.",1085097600,5,3705,4.571212121212121
1511721,5,B00005JMUK,"First off, if Charlize Theron had not won an Oscar for this performance, it would have been a HUGE injustice.  Charlize was absolutely brilliant as she took on this deeply emotional role by actually becoming Aileen Wuornos.

What is most disturbing about this movie is the fact that the emotions of Wuornos are real.  Her life was completely wasted after a horrific childhood, being raped, giving birth to a child at 13 and finally resorting to prostitution in order to survive on the streets.  She eventually comes to meet Selby (a very loose portrayal of the actual girlfriend Tyria Moore) in a lesbian bar.  She becomes very agitated after being somewhat hit on by Selby.  Eventually, she finds that her attraction to Selby is strong and she enters into an affair with her.  Christina Ricci is equally amazing in her portrayal as the naive turned selfish Selby, firstly being innocent and just wanting to be with Aileen to becoming an incredibly selfish, self-centered girlfriend.

Aileen wants a normal life for her and Selby and after being turned down many times at various job interviews for her lack of education and her mannerisms, she must reconsider her options.  Fade into Selby telling Lee she must go back to prostituting because their money is short and any prospects for going straight are slim to none.

The first murder is highly disturbing.  This scene was incredibly emotional.  After being knocked out by her john, her back is completely cut and he pours rubbing alcohol all over her and she is screaming.  Her then rapes her and she manages to slip out of the rope tied around her wrists and she then committs her first murder.  Understandable this murder is in self-defense, but once she sees how easy it is to get free money and cars by robbing these men after she has taken their life, it seems like the easy way to live.  She then becomed the hunter, looking for men she could easily kill and take their possessions.  Many, if not all of the men she murders following the first, are not in any way deserving of being killed.  Even Wuornos herself has to make herself believe that these men are only out to hurt her and that they are deserving of their fate.  Tired of being used, abused, taken advantage of and treated horribly by the majority of people in her lifetime, she convinces herself that these men are the culprits, thus finding it easier for her to vent her frustrations by slaughtering these men.  Taking their belongings is just a bonus for her.

Not only is Theron's visual transformation incredible but she actually becomes Wuornos.  The emotions are real and you find yourself wanting to comfort her, while at the same time being appalled by the monster that she truly is.  All she ever wanted from anyone was to be loved and unfortunately she went through life without ever being truly loved.

This is a highly emotional movie that is very hard to get out of your head, even days after you've seen it.  I would higly recommend this movie to anyone.",1082764800,9,2991,4.685823754789272
1511722,5,B00005JMUK,"Slight spoiler alert toward the end....
Most the reviews of this film I've seen all seem to be under the assumption that the film maker here was trying to ""Get inside"" the mind of a serial killer, or show an understanding of Aileen's motives and rational behind the murders she commited. In my opinion it's a mistake for any viewer of this film to go into the theatre expecting the film to analyze the whole Aileen Wurnos controversy and by the end of watching it expect to be a little more wiser as to how and why this type of person comes about in our society and how they come about commiting such crimes. It's just not that sort of film. To me all this film is, is a little window in to the lives of two people. It just so happens that these two people are Aileen Wuornos and Tyria Moore. This film isn't there to answer any questions or justify any moral points, or be a vehicle to show the talents of the make up departments ability to change a stunning Hollywood actress into dirty trailer trash. It just shows a dramatic representation of some events that occured in two peoples lives and to show the humanity that can occur behind two people who find themselves in this bizzare situation. And it does it very well. The acting is of a very high standard and the story is told very solidly, depicting the facts. I didn't feel like I was being made to make any judgements on the characters and their actions in this film, I didn't feel like I was being made to expect a happy ending, it was just an interesting story being told in an interesting way.
Another point I cannot understand with the majority of reviews of this film is how the reviewers seems to be under the impression that this film is somehow obliged to provide us with a happy ending, and when we don't get a happy ending then the reviewer feels somehow cheated by the film. Not all art is beautiful, nor is it supposed to be. As art is supposed to be a reflection of life then it would be wrong for all films to have a happy resolution. But then loking at it another way the film DOES have a happy ending really, (...) I liked this duality of the film. In the words of Dr. Pepper, Try it you might like it!!",1082419200,4,2179,4.265700483091788
1511723,5,B00005JMUK,"The fact that Charlize Theron gives an unforgettable performance plus that ""Monster"" is very intimidating has been told in detail by most reviewers here, so instead, i'll take on the objections voiced by those who feel that this film is portraying a serial murderer in a way so she comes across as ""more human"".
  First off, some people claimed that the film is not accurate and that Aileen Wuornos (the real life killer) was nothing more than a cold blooded murderer. Aside from the first murder, which even in the evidence presented in court, was shown to have been committed in self defense after a savage rape, the film does show that eventually Wuornos killed for the money. Or did she?
  The reason i feel that this film does a good (but not quite great) job of going below the surface is because it shows us this woman's life without resorting to cheap sensationalism and without overstating or understating anything. This woman, like many 1000s, or even millions of people, basically live in that fringe of our society that resembles hell. She acquired street wits in the process but she also acquired brutal hopelessness, terminal despair, and ultimately distrust for anyone around her.
  When she gets in an affair with Selby, this relationship becomes to her the only way to exit the giant toilet bowl she virtually lives in. Problem was, like with many other things in life, she had no clue how. In her particular case, the fact that she wound up killing for a mere $200 shows what type of despair we're talking about. It's an old argument really, but one that won't go away no matter how hypocritically some of us choose to look at things, that is: anybody in our societies, ""good"" or ""bad"" is a direct product of that society. And that's undeniable, noone drops suddenly from the sky and lives amongst us.
  The character in ""Monster"" eventually comes to the point to treat people as she was treated. Yes, noone killed her physically (except the state in the end) but she had been morally and mentally ""murdered"" countless times before she turned into a murderer herself.
  Charlize Theron is incredible not because she took on 40 pounds and was made ugly to play this film, but because she stunningly managed to portray the mess in this woman's soul. That's the part of her acting that gave her the Oscar, which by the way - I felt- was one Oscar well deserved after a long, long time.
  But the same counts for the director of the film who manages to capture a life between rainy highways and back seats of cars, filthy apartments, sleazy bars with other hopeless characters, and ultimately a vast scape of nothingness. That's where the ""Monster"" was bred in and lived in.
  As for those who might've been offended with the film's language or the themes presented in it, well that's a true paradox, because that's like admitting that reality offends them. Sure, one can choose to avoid reality, but that never really works in the long run as ""what's there"" eventually -and always- catches up with us no matter what medium we use to avoid it.
  ""Monster"" is a truly good film, and in my opinion, whatever objections can be raised are either trivial or hypocritical.
  C.Theron is not the only one giving a great performance by the way. Christina Ricci is up to par with her even if this goes ""unnoticed"" as Theron's role is inevitably overshadowing.
  A film that intimidates with its rawness and its ultra-realism, ""Monster"" is one that won't let you easily forget it. Nor should you, if you ask me...",1082332800,2,3517,4.68780487804878
1511724,5,B00005JMUK,"I can't honestly say whether this a ""great"" film or not, and it doesn't really matter. Charlize Theron's portrayal is such a revelation that any lapses in truth or artistry in the storytelling are inconsequential. I saw this film early in its release, and my first reaction was that if this girl didn't receive an Oscar (for whatever it's worth), then they (The Oscars) really are a sham. Not that the story isn't well told and directed. It's just that Theron's portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuernos is so overpowering to the viewer that it IS the film. I had never caught more than a glimpse of Miss Theron, who seemed an intelligent but generically gorgeous blonde. I was surprised as anyone that she created one of the best performances ever captured on film. It is a performance that is much, much more than a weight gain by an actress and prosthetics. It is eerie in its ability to transpose one from the fiction of moviemaking... she IS Aileen Wuernos. And, while Christina Ricci and the other supporting players are effective in their roles, they are merely small planets in  Theron's orbit, and, totally eclipsed by her. As I have lived in Florida for many years, I was well aware of the carnage that Wuernos inflicted, and her well publicized lack of remorse. Her attitude and repulsive appearance brought forth little compassion. I also recall the twisted public jubilation at her execution, and though I had no sympathy for her actions, I was overwhelmed with the feeling of wasted life. After seeing this film, I still can't excuse the results of her actions. But, the feeling of a life wasted is more overpowering than ever, Theron so effectively portrays her wretched exhistance. Of a life totally devoid of any love, stability, or nurturing. That the little girl who grew up in the shadow of the ""Monster"", the carnival ride which loomed dark and evil over her in childhood, turned out to be viewed as a monster herself seemed inevitable and pitiable. Let's face it, the superlatives used to laud most acting performances almost always turn out to be nothing more than hype. Above and beyond that, there are a handfull of very good performances every year. Then, rarely, there is a performance that goes way beyond that, in its ability to take the viewer out of the reality of the fact that you are sitting and watching a film, it so totally involves you. It becomes worthy of being referred to as ""art."" This is one of those films, and it is due to Charlize Theron's performence alone. Whether she ever succeeds in ""topping"" her performence here is unlikely and incidental. Every once in a great while, something is ""touched by God"" to make a small and perfect creation. Charlize Theron's performance in ""Monster"" is one of those times.",1080864000,,2756,4.753653444676409
1511725,5,B00005JMUK,"A real life prostitute who flips and kills six people seems perfect TV-movie material, but not for a genuine attempt to interpret the character with anything other than the most cynical, shock-laden, exploitative eye. Monster, about the killings of Aileen Wuornos, proves otherwise.
Using a simplified narrative, and pseudonyms for all the characters except Wuornos, Monster covers the penultimate period of Wuornos's life where she killed six people before her 1991 arrest. The film begins with a portrayal of someone on the verge of suicide. From there we see her find love, nearly lose everything (in one of the few genuinely harrowing scenes in this film) to a murderous rapist, and, apparently change from a victim into a flawed avenging angel. There's some clever use of irony and artistic license here - one implication, for example, is that the first person to die at the hands of Wuornos intended to kill Wuornos after raping her, implying that he would have ended up being a serial killer had he succeeded.
Much has been made of Charlize Theron's Oscar winning performance as Wuornos, a credit she certainly deserves. Without her delivery and her control over the character, writer and director Patty Jenkins would not have made as powerful a case as she has. Wuornos's powerful personality, outer strength, and inner insecurities, are masterfully portrayed. I'm lead to believe by people I know with connections to Wuornos that Theron's Wuornos persona was spot on. Theron is able to make us feel sympathetic towards the character even in the midst of some terrible crimes, where you feel like screaming at her to stop, for her sake as well as her victim's.
Not having heard of Wuornos before this film's release, I wanted to know where Jenkins got her story from, and mostly drew blanks. Looking on the 'net you could be forgiven for believing a conspiracy exists to hide who Wuornos was. The media and police needed a serial killer and presented Wuornos as one. When problems with her conviction for the murder of Richard Mallory became apparent, advocates for rape victims and victims of prostitution intervened portraying the somewhat sociopathic six times killer as an almost innocent victim of a justice system biased against women. To death penalty advocates, she was a convenient embodiment of evil to use to demonstrate the justice executions supposedly serve. Everyone, probably including Jenkins herself, seems to have their own Aileen Wuornos around, a canvas to settle an argument or prove a point.
Wuornos wasn't simply a ""highway prostitute"" as described by the movie, she also took part in a variety of crimes before meeting her partner three years before Mallory's 1989 death; she even served prison time in 1981 for an armed robbery. Wuornos's claim that the killing of Mallory was self defense was initially met with skepticism, but with Mallory's record - never revealed to the Jury and involving a ten year sentence for a violent rape - and with inconsistencies in her original, dark and unhinged, explanations for the death, it's possible that Mallory did indeed attack her. But it's also hard to believe that the need to kill, in self defense, arose six times in the space of a year.
It is believable that, as Jenkins describes, a defensive killing during a horrific attack may push a very insecure, amoral, and frustrated woman over the edge. In this respect, regardless of the specifics of the Wuornos case, Jenkins has made a believable and informative film about human character and the choices we make. Whether it is an accurate portrayal of Wuornos though is something that can only be answered by seven people no longer alive to tell us.
The story may not be historically accurate, but it doesn't matter. A powerful performance, well paced script, and decent direction makes this a compelling and thought-provoking film. Well worth seeing.",1078704000,5,3880,5.02639751552795

1511831,4,B00005JMUK,"I saw ""Monster"" in the theater in 2004, and immediately knew no performance could beat Charleze Theron's portrayal of Aileen Wuonros, labeled a serial killer after shooting 9 men in Florida in the late 1980's.

Theron completely transformed herself from the inside out for this role.
Unrecognizable, she WAS Wuonros. She won the Oscar. Golden Globe, SAG and others.

Although I loved the movie, I have read accounts of Wuonros' childhood and the condensed version at the beginning of the movie was grossly unfair. It did not at all depict the level of instability, years of sexual abuse, and neglect Aileen suffered as a child and teen.
Her parents were young teens. Her mother abandoned her when she was 4, and her father was in prison for sex related crimes. He also was said to.have suffered from schizophrenia.

Aileen lived with her grandfather, who often beat her, and one of his friends sexually assaulted her for years, resulting in a pregnancy at age 13. The baby was given up for adoption.

I seem to remember she ran away, and lived mostly in nearby woods until she became involved in prostitution at age 13.

Aileen was not someone who evoked sympathy. She was loud, often angry, and spoke frankly.

I think she was treated unfairly AND inaccurately by the press, which could have changed the course of her life after being captured.

Just because there were unexplained murders of men in Florida, that seemed to be linked to sexual encounters, they began being referred to as serial killings, and when it was believed to be a woman, the press exploded with speculation about the first woman serial killer.

I think it is sexist, and an opportunity to sell stories.

Bonnie and Clyde killed people
during their robberies, John Dillinger, Al Capone, and many more who killed, or were responsible for many, many deaths. Yet, they are not labeled serial killers.

I think Aileen was likely not at all a sociopath, and especially nothing like the aforementioned who regulary either gunned men down, or ordered it, without batting an eye. Yet, they are not labeled
serial killers.

Just because men were being killed by a woman, and there was an element of sex, involved, she's a serial killer.

What is SO sexist and obviously a male perspective, is sexual gratification is almost always the motive for male serial killers.
Yes, Aileen, a prostitute since age 13, wanted just ONE more paunchy old man heaving over her! She was simply there to rob them, just like the notorious people above.
Labeling Aileen made stories more enticing, but it is a gross injustice and unfair that she be remembered that way.

The movie shows a horrifying rape, torture scene in a customer's car in a remote area, where she was severely beaten, tied up and penetrated with a metal object.

When Aileen regained consciousness, and he announced his plan for more rape and her murder, she managed to get free and shoot him with a gun he hadn't noticed in her purse.

It's interesting, with all the evidence of a bloody, horrible sexual assault, and beating, even then, she did not report it to the police.
Who knows what would have happened? However, it seemed  the state of Florida didn't much like hookers, gays, the non-religious, blacks..........

Wuonros, denying any previous gay activity, falls in love with Selby, played well by Christina Ricci, a shy, young gay woman, who flees with Lee from her Christian fundamentalist family, furious about her relationship with a prostitute.
Extremely dependent, the clear condition of their relationship for Selby, is that Lee is able to support her.
Although severely traumatized by her attack and the shooting,
Lee is desperate to hold on to Selby and their happiness, and does not tell her about it.

Lee announces she is going to get a regular job, but her valiant effort fails.
Even though she has done her best to dress up, her face and demeanor tell the story of her hard life, and the lawyer interviewing her summarily rejects her with some very nasty commentary.

Running out of money, Selby is pressuring Lee, and she is forced to go back to hooking.

In the trick's car, Lee begins to experience severe PTSD flashbacks and immediately starts firing, killing her second victim.
After that she went home with all the victim's cash and his car. She gained a sense of power being able to control her safety with a gun, but I would not say she developed a ""taste"" for killing. She felt empathy, and never killed for the sake of killing. She did not enjoy it. It did cause conflicting and buried emotions to surface, but the killing was always necessary to avoid getting identified.

Lee was obviously a very damaged person before she began killing. Bruce Dern, the manager where she rented a storage unit, and sometimes crashed, tries to give her food and go easy on her for the rent. A Viet Nam vet, he sees her hardship as equal to his.

Its not hard to see how isolating her world was, and how alone. This film is a cold stare at the complete absence of a place for Lee to go for help.  She has no family. Like most women in prostitution, family was something to escape.

Not only did she not seek or expect help, she probably gave up on help AND hope by age 5.
Even if we didn't know the story, we know the story

1511981,5,B00005JMUK,"First of all, Wuornos was not the first female serial killer in America!  Legend has held that the first widely recognized first female serial killer in the United States is Lavinia Fisher, born in 1793,  Fisher was hanged for her crimes.  The Six Mile Wayfarer House was thoroughly searched and the grounds dug up. Filled with hidden passages, the Sheriff reportedly found items that could be traced to dozens of travelers, a tea laced with an herb that could put someone to sleep for hours, a mechanism that could be triggered to open the floorboards beneath the bed, and in the basement, as many as a hundred sets of remains.
 Severely abused as a child, the horrors of Aileen Wuornos's life culminated in the killing of several men and her own execution. Good movie, with excellent acting, of a very sad woman.  Hardened by a lifetime of abuse, Aileen went on to murder 7 men.  A good watch, just does not touch the horrible abuse this murderer experienced.",1508889600,,961,4.690476190476191

I remember thinking of the reporting that there's something amiss here, something very different other than her being a woman and a serial killer. Then a couple of documentaries came out that shed light on Aileen Wuornos' life and MONSTER beautifully brings this horrific tragedy to cinematic life. There is nothing about this story that is not heartbreaking, but in MONSTER what we really see is the travesty of our society played out. The abuses certain women - most of them economically poor - have to take just to survive, only to be punished for them when the weight of it all becomes the impetus for psychosis. That's not to say Wuornos did not deserve either the death penalty or life in prison for killing the men that she did. But MONSTER illustrates how someone with a capacity to love can be pushed by life-long circumstances to her breaking point. Theron more than earned her Oscar, and every other accolade she received for this performance. Well done, Patty Jenkins.",1504915200,,1058,4.786885245901639

1512300,5,B00005JMUK,"If a human being were a country, her mind a head of state, would she have a right to wage war against rapists, child molesters, sexual predators  and other species of scumbags who would do her harm? How would her actions compare morally to waging a war?  Taking the analogy further, if the country's citizens were starving, and yearning for a better life, could a war be waged to acquire the resources to feed and nurture them?

That seems to be the ""monster's"" thinking in this movie. She has become a country onto herself, her lover a citizen who needs her protection. But as with any war, as is it progresses, it usually requires crazier and more distorted justifications to continue and eventually the enemy that is the target in reality may be increasingly innocent, as for example the women and children intentionally killed in Hiroshima in the atomic bombing. In this film, the final victim was not even interested in having sex or any  other type of exploitation, but was instead just reaching out to help her. He was still killed. The money and car were still taken, but by this point the ""war"" had lost its citizens' support and the monetary gain was essentially meaningless.",1486857600,8,1185,4.7101449275362315

They certainly made me feel sympathy for Aileen Wuornos, when perhaps she wasn't so worthy of it in real life. If all of her victims had been as horrible as the first one seemed to be, I would have had even more sympathy for her, but that one seemingly nice guy......
Christina Ricci was under-used in her part, I believe.

However, my very raw emotions of pity, anger, disdain and guarded empathy for those in life that are abused and often become abusers came out strong when watching this story.

If this isn't a wake up call to the world to eliminate abuse, treat others with respect and love, then I don't know what is.

1513016,5,B00005JMUK,"I lived in Daytona while this was taking place. But, that isn't why this film is important to me. This is a tragic true story, it's a testament to what can happen when life is so painful that a person starts to fragment into a broken soul, with a broken heart, and a monster emerges. It's a deeply moving story about what happens when instead of family, support, love, help, humanity, a person falls into despair out of lack and isolation, pain, abuse.
Everyone over the age of 21 should watch this, to learn, to explore compassion, and to have insight to share with preteens for the same reason.
Tragic lives are everywhere. We need to see it, to care, to be involved. If people like Aileen are not helped, we will be surrounded by the monsters our society has created.",1485129600,10,770,4.468085106382978

1513260,2,B00005JMUK,"I'll give Charlize credit for taking the ugly treatment to transform herself into this vicious (and ugly) serial killer. She looks a like the real Wournos and has clearly studied her peculiar twitchy behavior. She had it down pat.  Beyond that, this is just another attempt by Hollywood to elicit sympathy for someone who does not deserve it, I live in Daytona and have for many years so I know the Wournos story well. She was a career criminal and psychopath... and lifelong prostitute.
I guess the whole lesbian angle, which Hollywood loves, made them love this movie. That is the main reason it fails. An obsessive, almost single minded focus on the lesbian love affair, which happened but was not the most interesting part of the story. Wournos was not a victim. She was a serial killer plain and simple who got what she deserved.
 If more time had been spent focusing on that (her criminal record went far beyond prostitution) and the criminal investigation and trial, it might have been a much more interesting movie. This ultra low budget movie (made for a reported $8 million) is mostly fiction. Also, don't look for any authentic locations, other than the bar where she was arrested. The rest of was shot in Hollywood, probably mostly on the back lot.",1484438400,,1260,4.748858447488584

Sad, how as a child you are taught you can reach the stars and then your innocence is ripped away and there's no one to protect you, leading you unto a dark path.

Ricci, owner of the biggest, oddest female head in the movies, is so small in comparison to Theron that she almost disappears.  If she had a bobble head it would forever be falling over from being top-heavy.
Too much attention is paid to the relationship, not enough to the murders, meaning, of course, that Hollywood wants to EXCUSE the monster for her crimes, to humanize her.  Well, it didn't work with me at least.
A really cheaply made movie, most of the budget probably went into salaries for the actors with not much left over.  What a waste.  Of my time.",1483142400,4,679,4.540983606557377

1513777,1,B00005JMUK,"This movie managed to make Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci look really ugly.
Charlize looked exactly like Aileen, but Christina looked nothing like Selby.
I would have preferred two other actresses.

This movie was very boring with not much of a plot.
There was a lot more to the real story that the movie could have used,
like the backstory on the two women, and what happened to them after the movie ends . . . .

Specifically, the movie ended, when it should have continued with things like....
(1) Aileen getting arrested
(2) police and TV interviews with Aileen and Selby and the families of the victims
(3) the trial
(4) Aileen taking back her confession and changing her story several times
(5) death row
(6) the execution
(7) what happened to Selby after Aileen's death

There was so much more information available for this story that was left out.
It was never explained what Selby did all day and all night, while Aileen was hooking and killing - -  was she just sitting around in hotel rooms?
Why couldn't Selby get a job after her cast came off?

This movie does not make it clear what happened to Selby at the end - - I had to look it up - - and Selby was not even her real name.
If they were telling a true story, why did they change the lesbian lover's name?",1480118400,,1278,4.375527426160337
1513778,5,B00005JMUK,"Aileen Wournos was  the daughter of a narcissit a personality disordered woman evidenced in the documentary done by a British filmaker.  She was the daughter of a personality disordered mother and an abusive father.  She  never had a chance yet she was a lovely , kind, intelligent person.  Unfortunately American society is so sick that to add insult to injury rather than understanding that this woman was raped and traumatized they labeled HER with a personality disorder and criminal.  SHE was NOT the criminal.  Every man who paid her for sex when she was under age is A CRIMINAL and in America every man who paid her for sex when she was of age is a CRIMINAL.  Her mother is a CRIMINAL out walking around not having a conscience and not caring that her daughter was raped by her HUSBAND and many other men, not CARING that her daughter was ON the STREET.  Her mother and father are criminals that will surely burn for eternity for what they did to her.  And I know that the narcissistic lesbian  who pimped her out Sylvie or whatever her name is will burn too.  Anyone who watched the documentary and this film who does not cry has Serious issues.  This is a heart wrenching story of an abused child who could have frozen to death living in an abandoned car in freezing Michigan weather when she was 14 after giving birth to her father's child and then being thrown out of the house.  This is a disgrace. The American judicial system is guilty of murder.  Why America are you misogynistic so much so you'd rather elect a misogynist than a woman?  Why?  Ask yourselves that question.  And when you see the real documentary of this film and this film itself as yourselves why you hate women-because you do.

Ricci looks every part the lesbian but fails miserably speaking in a squeaky high voice and deserves a razzie. Charlize Theron deserved the Oscar for this performance;  in Monster, she embodies tragic victim and killer, Aileen Wournos.  Theron did a fine job, portraying Wournos as the abused and good-hearted woman she was.  Men raped Wournos repeatedly since she was age 13- she was not a cold-blooded killer the way the American media painted their story.
 The most annoying character in the film is the unattractive manipulative and lazy Silvie who refuses to work and executes perfectly,  her agenda to pimp out Aileen and keep the money to support herself.  SYLVIE is as guilty or more sinisterly liable for the repeated rapes of Aileen Wournos as the men who raped Aileen themselves, Sylvie was well aware that Aileen was damaged and killing men due to her ptsd.
  Silvie is a murderer.  She encouraged Aileen to murder these men and support her; she knew what was happening and she exploited Allen sending her into the streetts again and again to be raped.  I really hated the manipulative Silvie character-I don't know if Ricci intended to make her so annoying, ugly and cloying but she managed to alienate the audience.

Aileen wasn't born a lesbian she was forced into it from being raped repeatedly, and this is documented in the film.

There is another documentary by a sensitive British filmmaker on Netflix which describes the case factually ;the filmmaker exposes the people around Wournos who exploited her and he states, "" the only honest individual I dealt with involved in this case and Aileen's life,  was Aileen.""  Everyone around her wanted money and a piece of the action; even American police officers tried to sell false stories about her. The American judicial system is unjust.  The Aileen Wournos prosecution was a witch hunt in the most misogynistic country in the world.

More recently misogyny showed in spades in the United States when Hilary did not win because America keeps only White women down; African American women refused to vote for her because she is white.  Even Elton John stated  the United States is the most misogynistic nation in the world.",1480032000,,3902,4.752976190476191

While ""Monster"" is gritty, it doesn't really focus on the murders, the way the Henry Lee Lucas films did, so it's not nearly as disturbing. Actually ""Monster"" goes a long way in generating sympathy for Aileen.

The film is actually kind of plodding and very slow, but the reason I stayed tuned into the film was the performance by Charlize Theron.

There is no moral gray area here.

The only takeaway here is the safety net in the US still sucks, especially for those who have suffered mental trauma.

The acting was so convincing, the delivery of emotion had no doubt, and the music captured the essence of the film. Definitely not for kids; the violence, sex, and cussing are up there. After watching this film, I couldn't help but think about how damage and desperation could push a person so far to be able to carry out such brutal acts, and see how that's all they know, specially when you take in to account, what they've had to endure.

This is mainly a story about Charlize Theron who wants to be loved who has no home, no friend but ends up with being raped by this cop and happens to kill him for the first time in her life. From then on, she constantly kills any man who wants to have sex with her by paying her.
She becomes a serial killer after all.
But she also meets this girl Christina Ricci who seems to be the only creature who understands her.
She even decides to acompany with her by going out from home, apart from her mother.
To keep from alive, the both of them, she keep having fake hitchike and kills men. First she asks them money for the return of sex. Then she kills them all. For the revenge of the first man who raped her.

Charlize Theron was amazing in this film and she really deserves the oscar. And she sure won the both Oscar and Golden globe Best Actress.
As I first mentioned, Monsters Are Created Not Born!
It was not her look but her behavior that made her a monster. Killing men for no reason.
She even kills the man who really wanted to help her. The man who wanted to give her some money because she showed him some photos of her kids and tells him that she has to take care of them and need money. Maybe it's all lies though.

At the end she even  take the rap for the Christina Ricci. She ends up with having the death sentence.
I know that she deserves to die since she killed a lot of men. But it is just sad that no one saw her as a human being. They just wanted to see her as a sex toy and not even wanted to pay her as well.
She became a monster because of them not that she wanted to be one.

There was this French film called RESPIRE based on the noble written by a 18 year old girl and made into this movie. I really expected a lot but ended up with so much dissapointement. I wanted to see a true monsterous girl who had no friend, no future who finally meets this girl who ruins her whole life so bad that she has to kill her.
This movie made me kind of compensate me for that movie.",1466553600,,2230,3.986547085201794

Theron as I have seen others say did really an outstanding job in her portrayal of Aileen. Only thing really missing is any back story of her life that the Docs. cover and why this woman became the ""Monster"" she did. IF you like this Movie, on Prime are a couple of Free Documentaries done by the same man the real life Aileen seemed to trust to tell her side of the story to. Along with her thoughts of the ppl around her that she once trusted, setting her up along with Police Officers and ""friends"" that she claimed was making $$ from her crimes. Selling her story while she sat on death row. Including her 1st Lawyer who is interviewed while smoking pot on the way to Court to represent her. No excuse for her killing spree BUT a ""perfect storm"" to push a female into the man's world

1515992,5,B00005JMUK,"Although I am not generally a fan of bad language, the movie was well done indeed, with  Charlize Theron doing a phenomenal job of ""being"" Aileen!  This film makes you think about how abuse of a child can show up later in such heart-wrenching ways  This film is hard to watch in many ways, but it also shows both victim and perpetrator as victims.",1454025600,2,347,4.390625
1515993,5,B00005JMUK,"When film actresses Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci walk out on red carpets at international film and awards festivals, they often look like they stepped out of a shoot with vogue magazine, donning satin gowns costing $1000's. And yet in ""Monster"", about the notorious and mentally-ill Aileen Wuornos and her lesbian lover, Theron and Ricci don the clothes and outlook of lower-middle and even lower-class America. No longer are they the elite of Hollywood but two struggling lower-class nobodies, except, unlike her girlfriend, Wuornos is mentally ill, possibly schizophrenic, and she eventually becomes a serial killer.

Charlize Theron, in a performance which is nearly unbelievable in her transformation from Hollywood starlet to Midwest hooker for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress, plays Aileen Wuornos, an unstable prostitute who engages in a romantic fling with a young lesbian, Selby, played by Christina Ricci in an equally-compelling performance. (Wuornos' real lover's name was Tyria Moore.) Selby is a misunderstood and somewhat unloved young woman constantly residing with different family members who don't know what to do with her. For them, her lesbian predilections are anti-Christian. She meets Aileen Wuornos in a gay bar in Florida, and she's the first woman to respond to Selby's advances. Although Aileen is a prostitute and very high-strung, often flying into rages for little reason, she seems at first harmless. Shortly thereafter, Wuornos takes on a ""client"" who drives her to the woods and subdues her. Wuornos breaks free and ends the prostitute-client relationship--violently.

At the same time, Aileen and Selby's relationship is on the upswing, and they decide to run away together, infuriating the younger woman's family who know how Aileen makes her living. Aileen decides to renounce prostitution, but can't find a legitimate job. They are running out of money, and Selby is disillusioned with the entire affair. Her lover then returns to prostitution but with a twist. She's not going to engage in any sexual acts, as she had before. She's going to use her clients in a different way.

This is a very dark story about the underside of American life. Part of what makes it very disturbing is how real everything is. The dive bars, the cheap cars, and broken down houses are places often not portrayed on the large screen. None of the characters are particularly likable, except Selby (Ricci). Her parents are god-fearing but seem very heartless. And Theron as Wuorno is so unbelievably convincing you can't reconcile what she does in this film with her persona at social events. After production, Theron and Ricci returned back to the world of the Hollywood elite, but this story is forever etched in celluloid.",1454025600,,2765,5.2089887640449435

1516503,5,B00005JMUK,"Charlize Theron is the reason this movie is thrilling.  She is spell binding in this role,which is about as far away from the beautiful Ms. Theron most men find irresistable as one can imagine.  Mistreated and abused as a child, Lee suffers rejection in every aspect of her life.  Running away at 13 she becomes hard and unfeeling as a form of self-protection in her life as a prostitute.  Merely surviving she loathes what she's become UNTIL one fateful night she meets the love of her life.  Just when you think she's caught a break, things turn ugly quick as a serial killer emerges.

It's a portrait of a loveless life tragically accelerating toward destruction.  Theron's brilliant performance is indeed riveting and keeps the viewer stunned at the transformation this actress accomplished to persuade us she is this Monster.  Although it's hard to watch at times, there's an amazing life story told in the midst.",1441065600,4,918,4.877419354838709

All that aside, Charlie Theron was incredible in this movie.  Absolutely riveting.  This movie is sad and frightening as it is based on true events.

1516553,2,B00005JMUK,"I understand this was loosely based off of Aileen Wuornos, but I expected a little more accuracy than what was presented in Monster. Theron was absolutely amazing in her portrayal of Wuornos. After watching several interviews of Wuornos I have to say that Theron captured the complexity of Aileen - not just in looks, but in the way she carried herself and mannerisms. Wuornos was by no means hero, but she did have some sympathetic qualities that Theron managed to bring out brilliantly.
I didn't care for the movie because the real story of Wuornos was so incredible (rumors of incest, crooked cops, money deals gone wrong, conspiracy theories, etc), and what was delivered was a story that didn't quite capture the most interesting parts of Aileen's story. Instead viewers had the focus of the tumultuous relationship of Aileen and Tyria or ""Selby"".
I really wanted to love this movie, but I'm largely disappointed in the story-line. I'm sure others who are familiar with Wuornos's story will find themselves underwhelmed Monster's portrayal of America's first female serial killer.",1439942400,2,1085,5.101123595505618

This movie did a wonderful job of showing why she was this way. I don't believe she she was almost killed by one of her clients  or had a hard time murdering  the others. In the movie she was desperate to hold on to the one relationship she thought was real and would do anything to keep it. She had no regard for men who had used her since she was a small child and killing them seemed easy for her. I felt bad for her that she had such a hard life.  I don't condone her behavior at all.
I was amazed that Theron captured this woman's appearance and gestures so accurately. I could see the woman's desperation and distrust and unfulfilled needs. The storyline is gripping and the acting is the best I've seen. It is definitely worth watching again.",1439596800,3,907,4.292397660818714

However, when I actually finally got to watch this movie, I'm so glad I did get to see the bio-documentary, because there were things I wouldn't have understood, otherwise. That's probably why I was really disappointed, because if I'd only seen this movie, I wouldn't really gormtten it. It didn't seem to go anywhere except for that one last chapter in her life, but not much about her, except that she couldn't read or get a job, etc. It wasn't a TERRIBLE movie, but it didn't have much detail.

And if anyone ever had doubts about Christina Ricci's abilities this movie also smashes them.  Talented, creative, and un-afraid to push their limits, these women took their parts and RAN with them!  Simple in photography, scenery, direction and production, the movie feels raw - realistic, immediate and bare.
It is a really, really good movie that tells the true story of what happened when these two women got together.  I remember when it happened in real life. It was horrifying then and Ms. Theron's take on the facts brings all that back, and more.  The horror and the sadness, resignation, and humanism is right up front with the monster that Aileen Wuornos had become.  Ms. Theron got it.",1430611200,,793,4.880597014925373

1517072,5,B00005JMUK,"This film starts just as homeless prostitute Aileen Wuornos is going to kill herself with a gun she ironically keeps for protection, but first she wants to buy a drink with the few dollars she has left in her pockets because she doesn't want anybody to get for free what she worked so hard to get. So she goes down the hill to a gay bar to get her last drink where she meets Selby. Selby is sexually attracted to Aileen, who at first gives her a fierce rebuff. But then Selby tells her a little about her story - how her family is trying to ""reform her"" from being gay - and Aileen accepts at least some friendship from her, and changes her mind about suicide.

The friendship grows to mutual sexual attraction, and Aileen and Selby run off and move into a motel. Aileen intends to go straight, dresses up for interviews, and gets turned down by everyone. Selby's affection turns to impatience and ultimately angry manipulation as she uses Aileen's attachment to her to get her to go back into prostitution so that they can go out and have a good time. Aileen ultimately gives in, and that's when she meets up with convicted rapist Richard Mallory, whom she claimed to kill in self defense. That is the scenario the movie shows. From that point forward something in Aileen just snaps and she sees every john as a rapist worthy of death, even the ones she had to cajole into accepting her services using sob stories of fictitious hungry children.

The movie is grim and if you read the headlines at all during the late 80s and early 90s you know the story, but just let me say that for once the Academy got it right by giving Charlize Theron Best Actress Oscar. If you've ever seen the actual Aileen Wuornos captured on film, somehow the beautiful Theron got her down even to the wild look she'd get in her eyes - the look of an animal caged.

The movie didn't go too much into the real Aileen Wuornos' past, but all I can say is that she never had a chance given what I read. Born to a teenage girl and a schizophrenic criminal father, abandoned to be raised by grandparents who didn't want to be burdened with her or her brother, and then thrown out of the house by her grandfather after her grandmother's death when she was 15, nobody ever treated her like a human being. I'd like to think the title of this film - Monster - is the ultimate in sarcasm, because what else could Aileeen Wuornos ever have become but a monster given that all she had ever known from other human beings was monstrous treatment.",1428796800,,2508,4.389247311827957

In ""Monster"" she is an ADHD'ed, hopped up version of a killer that I don't recognizr as Charlize. So props to her for great acting.  And she is a whirl wind of frenetic energy. And Ricci's character serves to make her the killer she is. Why the name, ""Monster?"" watch the movie.

"" It's said that Charlize gained 30 pounds, shaved off her eyebrows, colored her hair, and wore contacts and prosthetic dentures to completely change her appearance. Toni G, the movie's make-up artist, also applied a great deal of makeup to age her skin and add freckles.

1517362,5,B00005JMUK,"Charlize Theron is dumbfoundingly great in this story based on the life of Aileen ""Lee"" Wuornos, the murderer of seven men whom she claimed solicited her for prostitution but threatened to rape or kill her, provoking her into self-defense.

When Lee meets ""Selby""--a naive, friendless but also self-involved young lesbian, wonderfully portrayed by Christina Ricci--she isn't yet a killer; she's ""just"" a woman abused since childhood: a homeless, suicidal drifting prostitute who's worked her way down to Florida but reached the end of the line. Selby reignites Lee's never-quite-defeated belief in true love, and there follows an odyssey of motel rooms and dreams of the Good Life farther south. But then comes a brutal rape and torture at the hands of a john which ends in murder, which Lee first attempts to hide from her new lover. She'll go straight, she announces; she'll quit hooking, and even makes an attempt at straight jobs--only to have that attempt end in further disaster and humiliation. Rejected by the straight world and pressed by Selby for money, she ultimately returns to prostitution. But it's quickly a short step from ""he raped and threatened me"" to ""he would have done the same things if I hadn't killed him."" Seemingly horrified at first by the murders, Selby is soon egging Lee on: they need cash, they need a car, where is the Good Life that Lee promised? Selby's knowledge of the killings--and the question of where her particpation in, or encouragement of, them begins--is a question handled adroitly in the film. One thing is certain, though: when news of the slayings finally hits the airwaves, it's a slow fall for Lee from revived dreams to capture, prison, and betrayal.

What makes this film so exceptional isn't just its harrowing storyline; it's the near-perfect performance of Theron--who manages to convey at the same time the represssed rage and repressed hope that made Wuornos such a complicated individual. Theron captures Wuornos's tough, hardened exterior with every line and gesture, yet also the captures the tenderness she longs to express; although the cruelty Lee endures becomes the cruelty she perpetrates, she remains a character one can empathize with, as Theron exposes her every layer with subtlety and sureness. This is a bravura performance backed up by fine writing, an exceptional cast, and a story that stays with you long after you leave the theatre. It's the kind of movie you wish everyone made; but it sets an impossibly high standard, so it may be a while before we see its like again.",1419465600,3,2550,5.011792452830188

Recently I watched it for the second time. If you have never seen it you are missing a tour-de-force performance by Charlize Theron as she completely transforms herself into Aileen Wuornos. It is skillfully directed and beautifully edited.

I recall Aileen's trial and execution. She was one of the countless people in this world who have no chance at all.",1412467200,,515,4.586956521739131
1517404,1,B00005JMUK,"First off, the acting in the movie was great. Charlize earned her Oscar. Ricci was good too even though I found her a bit whiny and too naive but maybe that was just the character. The movie wasn't that riveting, in fact it was kinda boring and draggy in spots. What I hated most was how the film depicted Aileen as a victim and even tried to say she killed the men because they abused her, when Aileen ADMITTED before she was executed that she lied and that the men didn't attack her and she just killed basically for the fun of it and to rob them. So I think it was sickening for the filmmakers to paint her out as some victim when Aileen even said she lied and the men hadn't done anything to her. I couldn't get over that. Also I doubt Aileen even was this kind and sensible as Charlize was in real life. She didn't seem that way from the real-life footage I've seen of how Aileen really acted. She was smug and cocky and even bragged about her killings. A woman who had NO remorse and even said she'd kill again if she was ever released. I had NO sympathy for Aileen in the movie and none for her in real life either. NO WAY. Sad life or not, many people go through the same things Aileen claim she went through and don't kill people. The filmmakers tried to portray Aileen as this misunderstood person but she was a stone cold, evil person who killed in cold blood. Period.

Hollywood needs to stick to facts and stop romanticizing real-life villains.",1412294400,3,1457,4.278985507246377
1517405,5,B00005JMUK,"Aside from mesmerizing the viewer with her amazingly true to form portrayal of Florida's, convicted serial killer: Aileen Wuornos, Actress Charlize Theron is superb, in her performance as a highway prostitute, who was abused, once to many times by the john's that frequented her. Aileen Wuornos, the once pretty, little girl who wanted to become an actress, who - quickly, at a young age, having been viciously molested and raped, fell into the world's oldest profession for women, prostitution. Her's was the dangerous world of biker bars and rough, highway prostitution within the State of Florida. Wanting love and not getting any, this woman became her own lone wolf madame and having for years practiced the act of sex in the most bizarre and kinkiest of forms which initially she allowed, she decided that this time, she was going to retaliate. How? By killing the men that had hurt her. Down went a john. Down went a cop. Down went a happily married family man, who just happened to have picked up the wrong hitchhiker at the wrong time. As well as a few other men who were killed by her. She continued this killing spree because having unsuccessfully attempted to find reputable employment positions, she continued with her licentiousness and whoredom for the finances to impress, secure and provide for a greedy, selfish woman whom she had fallen in love with, played by Christina Ricci. Her lover, was a spoiled-rotten, immature, brat, who had a nauseating 'sense of  entitlement' and Aileen, with her desperate need for true love, became an immediate 'enabler' to her lover's demands. She made excuses for her. Protected and lavishly provided for her lover, even to her own detriment. But after the initial novelty of the romance wore off and the honeymoon period was quite thoroughly over, the two of them having smashed a stolen car, were on the run and started arguing. This led to the ultimate leaving of her lover and the capture and trial, which having been found guilty, led to her demise by way of lethal injection. Aileen Wuornos was one of the few women from the whole of the United States that was listed as, a female serial killer. Sad, but true. This true story is gut-wrenching drama, that is very sobering with a powerful message with plenty of food for thought, for adult men and women and their expression of: Sexuality with strangers. For mature audiences, only. Nina Kish",1412035200,,2401,4.85609756097561

1517407,5,B00005JMUK,"I wasn't expecting Monster to be such a devastatingly surreal and emotional journey involving the real life of a woman who became a prostitute and eventually a murderer.  I certainly wasn't expecting to sympathize with a murderer either but you know, the way this story is told you sort of can't help but sympathize with the woman.

What makes this movie so remarkable is the acting of Charlize Theron.  I am absolutely stunned at two things- one her acting performance being one of the very best and edge of your seat worthy I have witnessed from an actor or actress in a long long time, and two that she looks NOTHING like the woman she portrays in this movie.  I mean she must have done everything in her power to make herself look homely and withered because she very accurately portrays a prostitute who once had dreams as a young girl to find the perfect man only to find herself in the grimmest of situations- having to deal with filthy sex-driven men on a constant basis.  Charlize is actually a very attractive woman who looks *nothing* like the dirty, beat up and worn down character she portrays in this moive.  Remarkable transformation!  She also looks alarmingly similar to the real life murderer Aileen Wuorous who she's portraying which is kind of freaky if you ask me.

This movie shows what it's like to be a prostitute in the hardest most accurate way that I've possibly ever seen (and I've seen hundreds of movies showing prostitutes in many different scenarios, but none like this one).  While at a bar she meets up with Christina Ricci's character, who happens to be a quiet, confused, vulnerable loner type.  She and Charlize's character eventually hit off a relationship that soon becomes romantic and intimidate.  The scene that plays Tommy James & the Shondells ""Crimson and Clover"" and all the grooviness, funkiness and dreaminess associated with the song during an intense make out scene is an extraordinary moment.

I truly can't find the words to describe how impeccable Charlize's acting skills are.  When she's angry you feel angry, when she's sad you feel sad, when she's optimistic and believes she and Christina will find a way out of the dingy motel rooms where they often stay, you feel optimistic as well.  This is how you know you're experiencing a phenomenal actor or actress- when *you* are able to feel what the characters on screen are feeling.  Amazing job!  Christina Ricci provides another touching moment of characterization.  You know that she comes from a very different background than Charlize with a loving family and yet, you're surprised she's so willing to throw her comfortable lifestyle away and basically run away with a prostitute she doesn't even know despite what her parent think all because she feels a connection with Charlize.  I love the way Charlize does everything in her power to protect Christina from the brutal reality of the outside world in addition to preventing Christina from finding out what she actually does for a living.  This movie is just REALLY good all around in so many ways.

The only issue is your emotional state of mind.  What do you want to happen?  I mean, Charlize is going around killing men while being a prostitute due to one particularly horrific incident (and I mean HORRIFIC in how realistic it looks) where she was raped and roped while a man almost killed her but she managed to free herself and turn the tables by killing the man.  You feel like justice is served right?  Because for one thing you saw what was about to happen- she was about to get raped and killed.  You want her to win as a result.  And also you're seeing how her life has deteriorated and continues to spiral out of control.  But... she's now a murderer and murder is wrong.  That's why I ask, what do you want to happen?  It makes you feel guilty for supporting Charlize Theron the first couple times she kills but then you realize she's starting to find excuses for killing to the point it appears she's enjoying it because it means free cash and a car to steal, so you back away your guilt trip in a hurry!  At least I did.  I guess I shouldn't speak for anyone else but I certainly know Monster made ME feel guilty for supporting her all because she's the one receiving the most attention and giving us her detailed story concerning her past.

When it gets to the point that the moment she steps inside a car with a man and he suggests a really dirty sexual move and BAM!  He's shot and killed in cold blood instantly well... you can't really cheer for that!  However you recognize her life is just so crazy she almost can't help it.  She's done lost it and must be on the defensive for now on just to survive.  Whenever she sits with Christina Ricci and tries to justify her behavior, that's when you'll experience her award-winning acting skills in all its glory.  I do dislike the way the men are betrayed, even if it might be realistic.  To just say really awful sexual and perverted things to a woman while demanding sex and handing over cash is... ugh, just horrible.  Apparently a selection of men out there actually act this way towards women (prostitutes or not) but I find it repulsive personally and anyone with a conscience should feel the same way.

Overall highly recommended movie but be warned- the interaction between Charlize and the dirty men is REALLY inappropriate with sexualized words spoken very clearly and offensively.  Otherwise if you can withstand the language, this is an amazingly well-told drama.",1411689600,,5504,4.691666666666666
1517458,5,B00005JMUK,"I have followed the Robert Hansen story for a long time, and have even read ""Fair Game,"" a true-crime thriller in which I gave a fairly strong recommendation on this site.  I have seen YouTube videos and watched ID Network documentaries about him, and finally screened ""Frozen Ground"" last year featuring John Cusack as the killer, an actor whom I've always really liked.  Suffice it to say, not that it was Mr. Cusack's fault by any means, but that movie was a huge misfire, to risk using an inappropriate word.  Mr. Hansen was portrayed as a one dimensional -- perhaps two-dimensional tops -- character, as the audience learns almost nothing about one of the scariest serial killers ever while watching that film.

Not so here.  Charlize Theron, an actress who is truly three dimensional in this role as Aileen Wuornos, plays this character as well as anyone could, perhaps even better than Ms. Wuornos could herself.  I have seen this film several times now over the years, and Ms. Theron's performance never ceases to amaze me.  In particular, there is one scene where she is gazing into the eyes of Christina Ricci, where Ms. Theron is about to give her supporting actress a kiss.  I cannot tell you how good of a complement this is, but I almost puked looking at Ms. Theron, as I was thinking that I wouldn't get within ten feet of her, let alone want to kiss her.  She is that disgusting here.  Now THAT is acting, since in real life she's an obvious beauty, but obvious kudos also must go to the makeup department as well.

In another scene, a cop forces the female killer to perform a sex act on him, and I can't remember any other film where I said out loud (and I am a guy, which really matters here):  ""Bite his d--- off!""  When a guy yells that while watching a film, you know that the actress has truly done her job -- OK; pun intended -- making her character beyond sympathetic.  And if you can make Ms. Wuournos come off as sympathetic, well, you can probably make the audience care about and understand anyone.  And you probably should win an Academy Award, just as Ms. Theron did.

This is a serial killer film, no doubt about that, but it is surely more than that.  You could call this a love story as well, although it's hard to believe that anyone loved Ms. Wuournos in real life, including herself.  But ""Monster"" forces the viewer to at least consider objectively how Ms. Wuournos turned out to be such a monster herself, and if most of the story is true -- I'm not sure myself, but I have placed a Kindle book on my reading list and will soon find out -- then even the most cynical viewer might shake his head and moan, ""Well, I might have killed that guy too.""  Or perhaps say, ""I wish that he at least gets his d--- bit off.""  But then again, I don't know which one is worse.

Well, if you can make Aileen Wuournos a sympathetic character, you've nearly pulled off the impossible, a feat that I suppose is not completely surprising given the standard incredible acting chops of one Charlize Theron.  But it's too bad that the director of ""Frozen Ground"" didn't at least take an extra peek at this film before shooting that much weaker effort, which would have given another fine actor -- Mr. Cusack -- at least a chance at making us understand Mr. Hansen a bit more.",1410825600,,3292,4.469899665551839

1517489,5,B00005JMUK,"Well...What we have here is a disturbing movie in some ways, but that is its intention, anyway. It allows us to think about the marginalized of our society and tries to make us understand what Aileen Wuornos went through in her life. Of particular importance is the absolutely terrific acting by Charlize Theron (for which she received Best Actress in this role) and Christina Ricci, who nearly steals the show. Before viewing, one should take a look on Wikipedia of the real story behind one of the nation's few women serial killers. And then, make a decision as to whether or not she should have been executed or not. In working with those deemed mentally ill as well as the marginalized, I have discovered they all have their own stories, some of which are just plain awful. Such is the case here. Other reviewers state with an air of ignorance and subtle racism that Wuornos should have approached social services in an attempt to wrestle with her demons in a safe manner and get some support, medication and resolution in a halfway house. I seriously doubt that Wuornos had the belief she could trust those agencies in light of the fact no one really understood her, or those demons she grappled so hard with. While it is true that as a prostitute one's daily life is always at risk, knows the dangers faced, and try to get something to eat to keep from starving to death. To care about persons such as what is depicted here knocks on the door of our capacity as humans to show some level of compassion, some level of maturity. That can be hard to do at times. Scenes where Theron faces potential employers are disturbing, as she gets angry and tells them off, rightly so in some respects. Bad behavior, indeed. On both sides. But practicing loving kindness is something not only lacking in Wuornos, but in those potential employers as well, and society as a whole. When you see this film, think about the true fact Wuornos was deemed Borderline Personality Disorder and Anti-Social Personality Disorder. Most of the time, personality disorders are difficult, if not impossible, to resolve, with or without medication, with or without therapy. Then, to be subjected to the criminal justice system in Florida is also difficult, and the subject's notoriety preceded her before she even had the remotest chance of a fair trial. When one deals with pathology of this magnitude, it is indeed, difficult to cast aside one's own prejudices in dealing with this population of the marginalized. The saving grace of Wuornos' legacy is that when one sees this film or reads about her life, perhaps compassion will find a way into one's life so that others may benefit. Movie Critic Roger Ebert at the time thought this the Best Film of the Year when it first came out. I would agree. Worth seeing and highly recommended.",1404000000,3,2814,4.733197556008147

1517493,5,B00005JMUK,"Monster is not an entirely perfect film. The story, overall, is pretty weak, and the original score is problematic in that at certain points, it diminishes the emotion instead of magnifying it. Other than that, Monster is a movie that demands the viewers undivided attention, and that's exactly what it gets. Charlize Theron as Aileen Wuornos is a godsend. The character of Aileen is one that is so complex: she's sympathetic, relatable, brutish, and often disgusting. Normally, this kind of range would seem uncomfortable or forced, but Theron pulls off Aileen's attitude with shocking exactitude. Although the performance's legacy may suggest otherwise, Theron playing Aileen does not come off as showy, or like she was going for an oscar-grab. She simply WAS her character and that's all there is to say. Christina Ricci as Selby Wall, Aileen's lesbian lover, proves to be a great foil for Theron. Selby's character, who is easier to pinpoint, isn't any less engaging. She is what makes this movie about a murderous prostitute a story that's grounded in reality (even though it's based off true events). Whether or not Selby truly loved Aileen, she was just a young girl trying to find her place in life and fed off Aileen's dangerous vibes. She lived vicariously through her lover's adventures, and as filmgoers, we can all relate to that. As shocking as it sounds, Selby and Aileen may be one of the most engrossing on-screen couples ever. Bravo to the brilliant actors and a fine script by Patty Jenkins. The visuals by Jenkins and Steven Bernstein are downright tailor-suited for the subject matter. Monster has a very dark and gritty cinematic tone which harkens back to 70's Scorsese, namely Mean Streets and Taxi Driver. The grain and the low lighting mix perfectly well with the trashy retro backdrop to create such a vivid setting for the drama. Monster, at its heart, is a relationship movie. But it is so far removed from the genres implications that it becomes something entirely different and special. A near masterpiece.",1402358400,,2037,4.9941176470588236

No wonder why Charlize Theron got the Academy Award for it: at first, I thought that Christina Ricci actually performed better than her but throughout the film, Charlize conveys a feeling of fragility and loss that is unequaled. No spoiler alert but I shed tears at the end...
Of course, this got me to learn more about the real case and I have noticed there were some differences with the movie (in real life, she had already been in a relationship with a woman before...) but that's okay. Hollywood likes to dramatize things and in this case, they did it very well.

1517695,5,B00005JMUK,"This film was certainly no glam role for gorgeous Charlize Theron!  She supposed put on 45 pounds by eating junk food for her brilliant and extremely disturbing performance of serial killer, Aileen Wuornos, in the indy 2003 film Monster.  I truly believe that her performance in the film is one of the greatest acting jobs I have ever seen.  I recall reading that after Wuornos was apprehended, the FBI (who categorizes killers) had to create a whole new category for her.  Apparently, at that time, she was the only female sexual serial killer who worked alone.  The film does not dwell much on Wuornos's early life of great abuse and neglect, nor does it attempt to offer excuses for the heinous crimes she committed. It does not take a stand on capital punishment.  (Wuornos was executed by lethal injection by the state of Florida in 2002).  It is a difficult film to sit through.  I found myself becoming uncomfortable and was even tempted to turn it off when Theron hit the Florida highways again, seeking her next victim.  But that's all part of the actor's and the screenwriter's genius.  They created such unbearable tension, horror and heartbreak. This film may not be for the weak of heart, but it is a must see for anyone who can deal with graphic, real life violence and wants to see a truly amazing performance.  I was very pleased when Theron won the Oscar.  It was well deserved.",1379548800,3,1395,4.672131147540983

1517727,5,B00005JMUK,"This movie is now part of my home library. I even bought another copy on Blu-Ray, that's how good it is. The direction and prodution values are as good as I have ever seen as are the performances by Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci.

Here's the problem. Exactly how truthful IS this movie?

Charlize Theron is a tall blond woman and, made up to look neglected and dissipated, she certainly looks like Aileen. Video recordings of the real Wournos will show you how good Charlize's physical and vocal impersonation is. It's damn near perfect.

From that point on, the movie takes us in a different direction. Aileen's lover. Selby, is played by Christina Ricci, one of the best of our young screen actresses. Christina probably could not be upstaged by a monster if she were playing opposite Godzilla himself. That's how good an actress she is. Christina is petite and pretty. Aileen's real-life lover, Tyra, is a large, homely, masculine looking woman with broken teeth and bad skin. She's not the type of woman who elicits sympathy from an audience the way that this artificial Selby can do.

The movie continues to take liberties as Aileen begins her career as a serial murduress. Aileen's first victim (played by Lee Tergeson of OZ), is a violent woman-hating rapist who beats, sodomizes, rapes and almost kills her. She shoots him in defense of her life. You will want to applaud.

From there, the story meanders into audience manipulation with each victim a little more sympathetic than the one before him and Aileen now on a path of no return.

The men that Aileen encounters, even while not ""plying her trade"" are insensitive dirtbags including a cop who forces her to perform oral sex in order to avoid arrest and, in the film's most unbelievable scene, a prospective employer who insults and degrades her during the job interview. The truth is, Aileen would have been screened out long before the interview. Except for her lover Selby, Aileen is alone.

Aileen's final victim is a sympathetic middle-aged grandfather who only wants to help her out of trouble, offering to take her home to his wife and let her use the spare bedroom.

Now see here! The only people who know what happened on the nights of the murders are Aileen and five dead men! Aileen says she was raped but who is there to contradict or support her story?

And, how about Aileen's marriage to a much older man with a little money of his own? Aileen beat him repeatedly, until he filed for divorce. This little detail is conveniently left out of the movie.

All this does not negate the fact that this is an excellent movie. It is a great movie and you should see it, but see at least one of the documentaries as well, just to keep things in perspective.

If the title hadn't already been taken, i would have called this movie, this story, An American Tragedy.

Obviously, Aileen had a very sad history of neglect and abuse that was never dealt with properly by society.

So, you start out feeling pity for Aileen as someone who has fallen through the cracks of society and cannot pull herself out of her tailspin. Then, as she begins to kill, she becomes more and more frightening as her mental illness takes control of her life.

It's a sad story, really.",1372377600,,3236,4.664323374340949

1517773,5,B00005JMUK,"Charlize Theron with out a doubt gives one of the greatest performances in movie history as convicted serial killer Wuornos, a prostitute that was mistreated her entire life and then turned to killing her Johns after she experienced a rape at the hands of a sadistic trick. Theron's performance is nothing short of astonishing here. She was clearly so consumed by this real life character she was playing that it is absolutely terrifying to see how good she was playing this woman. Christiana Ricci also gives an unforgettable performance as Selby, the young lesbian that Wuornos decides to have a gay affair with. Ricci is so good that if she had played this character to the same perfection in another film without being overshadowed by Theron's amazing performance she might have her self won a few awards for a deeply moving and believable performance. To play characters like these, especially if you are a heterosexual playing a homosexual, it must be painfully difficult, especially considering the demands made on the actors who had to engage is some very steamy sexual situations the script called for. Yet both actresses seemed so connected to their roles that it truly is incredible to see them together on screen producing two of the greatest performances in cinemas history. This film while extremely depressing in its unfortunate subject matter is an electrifying experience putting it bluntly. The film is very depressing in a unique way that may leave you saddened that some people on this earth could suffer and lose so much that they would resort to murder because of the horrible way their lives turned out. Ultimately its a very tragic story about how one woman makes the worst choices in life, and the horrible ruin and bitter end that it leads to.

That fact that Theron got the Oscar for this portrayal only adds to the fact that this is a great movie. This is Independent film making at it's best. I love how every scene feels real. When Theron does her monologues she manages to take you on a roller coaster. At times you feel sorry for her and at times you are terrified by her. Especially in the scene where she proclaims that everyone kills and it's alright to kill. And I cry with her when she's at the bus stations and she bawls her eyes out telling Shelby, played by Ricci, that she ""f-ed up"" (my favorite scene). And the way Ricci portrays her character only adds to Theron's performance. She is able to play this innocent, confused girl who just wants to be accepted and loved.

1517960,4,B00005JMUK,"Model Charlize Theron plays an abused girl (Aileen Wuornos) who grew up to become a homeless, mentally-disturbed, slow-witted prostitute, and ultimately becomes a serial killer. Early in the film she meets Selby Wall, just beginning to accept her lesbianism. Theron tries to stop 'hooking,' but cannot get a 'regular job.' Returning to her prime expertise, she encounters a dangerous customer who severely beats her. Theron escapes her ties and shoots/kills him.

Done once, it becomes too easy to repeat as an easier source of money. Eventually she kills a total of seven, is caught, convicted with the assistance of Wall (in exchange for immunity), and ultimately executed after 12 years on Death Row. While three psychiatrists concluded she was sane, her behavior suggested otherwise at the end.

Further research establishes that Wuornos never met her father because he was in prison for rape/attempted murder of a 7-year-old girl when she was born. He subsequently hanged himself, Wuornos and her brother were placed in the custody of their grandparents. Both the grandfather and her brother had sex with her, as well as others in school. At 15 she was thrown out of the house. More prostitution, an armed robbery, forged checks, and a failed marriage to a 69-year-old followed.

Next let's make a movie about Josef Fritzl, and how his life was tragic (as it was) and how he's a victim, while totally ignoring the suffering he put his daughter through, locking her in his basement and sexually abusing her for a couple decades. Not to mention the fact that daughter had a much harder life, but unlike Aileen never did anything bad - robbing, whoring.. the effects of which everyone seems so happy to ignore, while in hypocrisy feeling self righteous about accusing others of things like cheating, as Aileen does in this movie numerous times, as if it gives her some kind of high ground. In fact maybe some of Aileen's victims were similar people to this daughter locked in the basement, with worse lives but who suffered to do good, while getting screwed over even more. by Aileen.

But I digress, I've been known to feel pity for people like rapists and so on. I think what I'm trying to say is that I'm mad at the way society overlooks some evils, like whoring, while demonizing others. This movie does that, and to REALLY cut to the chase; I just feel like this movie is really just another platform for selfish people to be parasitic; sexually careless and selfish; flaunting; virginity collecting and so on, totally profiting and dehumanizing the best of people, who suffer way more at the hands of a conformist society, all the while making themselves out to be victimized. It's so standard in society, and I can't stand how the dynamic between victim and victimizer has switched roles in people's minds from where I really feel it should be. You know that 99% of what goes on in the world is just people being selfish. Not their hands being forced, and even if their hands are forced, the negative consequences remain.

On a more personal note, I've studied Aileen, and she's nothing like the film portrays....",1328572800,,1853,4.646341463414634

1517965,5,B00005JMUK,"Hi:

The DVD of the movie The Monster arrived on time and in excellent condition. The purchase price (about $4) is hard to beat.

The movie, about the female serial killer Aileen Wuornos, features superlative acting. It doesn't get any better, folks. I saw the documentary on Aileen Wuornos, which featured several interviews with her. One gets a feel for her mannerisms and personality. Not only did Theron in ""The Monster"" have her movements down perfectly -- they way she'd throw her head back with her eyes bulging when she was mad, the way she'd burst with rage at little provocaton, her great good humor and exuberance -- but she looked a lot like her. As in the documentary, one couldn't help but like Wuornos -- certainly a lot more than most of the men she was servicing as a hooker.

The first killing was self-defense -- the director showed her briefly holding a saw: Okay, did she dismember the body? Don't slide that past the viewer. We know she wasn't a sweetheart -- after that, as the movie made clear, she was murdering them. In other words, this is a fair portrayal of the woman. And one still can't help but like her.

A student of the cinema might want to watch this film a number of times to catch all the little things the director does with the actors, lighting, etc. There is a lot to watch for. The only issue I had was understanding, at first viewing, how it was that Aileen came to be apprehended. It wasn't entirely clear.

But watch it for the acting. Theron won best actress for this role. I understand the woman who played her lover was nominated for best supporting actress. Bruce Dern was also in the film -- he's always terrific.

If you haven't seen it, you're in for an acting treat.

1517998,4,B00005JMUK,"I think Wournos had a little Anne Heche syndrome which a surprising amount of women rebels and lesbians seem to conveniently get. Mental illness, threats, extreme, strange abuses.... did you know that male supremacist secret societies like Christian secret groups, white supremacists, the mob, freemasons, millionaires boys clubs and other groups practice psyche warfare and certain women seem to be getting these troubles more than others. At one point in the documentary (not this movie) she says they are using sonic pressure on her ears. The government and other psyche warfare groups actually do use techniques like this in hostage situations etc... and the CIA have done experiments with these and other techniques to manipulate people mentally. We are living in fascist country and she could well have been being driven mad. Some of these techniques are very focused and subversive, so if you are a target, getting proof or convincing others to believe you will be hard.

Wournos reminds me of John Brown of Bleeding Kansas fame, she mentions that people kill for all sorts of reasons - religions (usually male supremacists and anti-women's freedom religions) wars over resources etc... but you kill in defense of a woman's body and freedom, you get thrown in the crucifixion machine (lying media, court system, death system.) If you're against religions that practice child sacrifice and torture (Christianity especially) against animal abuse or the slavery of women you are shut down or shut up. Wuornos knew what happens, many of us are threatened, raped, tortured or killed. Watch the Stoning of Soraya M. and know that we are already living that reality in this country. Men define our morality (and it usually has something to do with being their slaves or ""subject in all things"" as per the bible) and then brutalize us for defying it. Secret male supremacist groups rule our lives in this so-called ""free"" country. Your right to vote is an illusion. Defy the male rule society and you stand a good chance of going mad, being conveniently afflicted with ""stressors"" psyche warfare style (lose the job, relationship, family, death in the family or friends. pets, using children or pets as hostages and threats)-  the networks of white and/or male supremacists do these things. White supremacists have openly stated they're using women to breed for their armies having many children per family. Male supremacists are doing this also and brain controlling children from a young age for breeders and slaves. Free speech is often a lie, many of us have trouble getting our message out there. You must stand up and fight back. The word is they are selling San Fran as the city of joy for homosexuals and then plan on destroying it. Do not gather in large numbers in one place, disperse yourself throughout the nation in groups large and small. If you are black or any race, do not gather in large numbers in one city. Homosexuals same thing. White supremacists are targeting you as are Christian fascists. If you gather in very large numbers you are in danger of being exterminated.

This movie portrays her as grotesque and clueless as the people attacking her would like. I bet she wasn't. In high stress the first thing to go is your mind and hygiene, not high on your list of priorities when being assaulted continually, which is why people in the know often end up crazy and on the streets talking about conspiracy theories (which have a lot of basis in reality). Do not believe psyche and image warfare. Aileen was a possible feminist folk hero to me and she was discredited because of the damage done to her mind, which is a common trick. In spite of the attacks to her psyche she was a strong fighter.",1298246400,,3717,4.878164556962025

Then, you have Selby Wall. For all purposes of the movie, a main ingredient, but truthfully non-existant.

1518004,5,B00005JMUK,"Critics and film audiences applauded Charlize Theron's revivting performance in 2003's ""Monster"" which documents the real-life incidents of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who went on a killing rampage in the late eighties and early nineties, eventually murdering 7 men. The film details the torment Aileen went through as a young girl, feeling unloved and abused, to the point that she became a street walker. Instead of feeling hatred for Aileen we feel for her as the movie makes the viewer realize the anger and torment a person goes through to get to the point of becoming a prostitute. Even the fact that she becomes a killer still doesn't make us hate her, as there is one terrifying scene where she is raped and battered by a john in the isolated woods. In order to survive she kills this man, which is the starting off point of her murderous rampage. The film is a lesson for us all as we see how society can be insensitive and crue to people, and its that insensitivity that can eventually make monsters out of people. Theron won a well-deserved Academy Award for her portrayal; in the film she gained 30 pounds and wore fake teeth to alter her Hollywood glamorous look. Most critics, even Roger Ebert, stated that Theron gives the greatest performance of any actress in any year. In one word her portrayal is spellbinding.

1518006,5,B00005JMUK,"A dark tale based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, one of America's first female serial killers. Wuornos had a difficult and cruel childhood plagued by abuse and drug use in Michigan. She became a prostitute by the age of thirteen, the same year she became pregnant. She eventually moved to Florida where she began earning a living as a highway prostitute--servicing the desires of semi-truck drivers. The tale focuses on the nine month period between 1989 and 1990, during which Wuornos had a lesbian relationship with a woman named Selby. And during that very same time, she also began murdering her clientele in order to get money without using sex. This turned the tables on a rather common phenomena of female highway prostitutes being the victims of serial killers--instead Wuornos, herself, carried out the deeds of a cold-blooded killer. Charlize Theron's performance in this movie is so incredible. It is a sad and moving movie. Never have I felt so disturbed yet riveted by a movie such as this one.",1264118400,2,1013,4.895348837209302

For a woman who is used to walking red carpets and gracing magazine covers, she really becomes an ugly, badly-damaged woman hooking along lonely highways. There isn't a false note in any single frame of this movie. She deserved the Academy Award, that's for sure.

From what I've seen in the documentaries about Aileen Wornos, this film humanizes her more, shifts a little away from her mental illness, and makes Christina Ricci's character more attractive, although it keeps her betrayal of Aileen at the end.

This is a sad, frightening story about women on the outside and the lengths they'll go to find love and acceptance in a dark and horrible world. Even cold-blooded murder.",1259539200,,869,4.979310344827586

Look at the plots of both films: victimized female beset by a collection of males that are uniformly evil and disgusting.  This is the standard RadFem plotline, which likewise wants to pose lesbian love (good) over against heterosexual love (male rape and abuse).

Anyone who has been exposed to feminist academics over a long period of time comes to recognize this plot coming down the street.  The value dialectics go thusly: ""Sure she kills men, but as the film shows all males are trash.  Sure, she's a monster, but it was males who made her one.  Sure, she kills men and is a serial murderer, but all the males in the movie conform to the standard anti-heterosexual-male feminist hatemongering.""  The portrayals in this film are strictly melodramatic: good girl vs. bad boy, a form of thinking that RadFems specialize in, thus putting on display their own questionable maturity of thought and judgment.

I gave the movie two stars because of the performance of the main actress, which truly succeeded in making her thoroughly repulsive (but don't forget: it's all men's fault. . .)

So much attention to teasing out the finer points of the two female characters' lives, while the male characters are interchangeable and interchangeably seen as having nothing to show but crude behavior.  They are characters out of the writings of Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon, who deal in the identical plot-line, something MacKinnon in any case has gotten the U. S. federal government to take seriously in its sexual harassment regulations.

1518116,4,B00005JMUK,"As with many people, my main draw to this film was the acclaim for Charlize Theron's performance. Well, that and the physical transformation. Unlike some, at least, though, that transformation didn't distract me from her performance because both are just so superbly well done. Charlize the model is so completely removed in sight and psyche that I ceased to think about it. I simply watched an amazing and, yes, Oscar-worthy performance. This is a tremendous acting achievement from someone who heretofore had precious little to indicate this level of potential. As I say, wow.

I can understand where some might find Theron's performance a little over the top, but personally I didn't think so. Knowing nothing of the real Aileen Wuornos, it struck me as merely the grandiosity of someone whose self has become so stretched beyond the bounds of normal behavior. I also understand but disagree with the opinion of some that the movie dismisses Wuornos' crimes behind so much PC victimology. The unfortunate truth is that whereas many killers are in fact born with an evil bone (and I'll brook no arguments that they aren't), some are indeed bred to it by circumstance. This doesn't excuse their behavior, it merely explains its source, which is what I believe Monster does very well. I think in the scenes where she does feel pity and shows mercy, the movie illustrates that Aileen does indeed know right from wrong, so that later, when she doesn't show that mercy, it's clear she's consciously chosen the wrong, and for the wrong reasons. I just didn't get from the movie the message that she didn't deserve her punishment.

The only minor negative I found in the movie was Christina Ricci's performance. That's not to say it wasn't good, but it struck me as merely that. In retrospect I think she could have occupied the role better. Though in all fairness to her, it may be only that Charlize is so good, Christina by comparison comes off as merely effective.

This is a difficult movie to watch, no doubt about it. It's one of those I'd usually choose to watch on video at home, due to the almost voyeuristic nature of watching something so intensely personal. But I didn't want to wait to check out Charlize's performance. I'd suggest others do the same. The movie is excellent--literally, directorially, musically--but Charlize Theron is outstanding.

Always seeing herself as a victim rather than a cold blooded killer, the movie lends some support for that notion.  We are to believe she is nauseous at the thought of casual sex yet does not hesitate to fire fatal shots.  She is even depicted as having mercy on one potential victim who was a virgin.  The acting is excellent.  However, the scenery, costumes and music are mediocre.  The film offers no comic relief. To its credit, the movie does not glamorize crime, but starkly portrays the bleak existence of those on the run. The title MONSTER is provocative. She did not torment her victims or even scare them.

This is a woman who had no one to help her, no place to go, and she survived day-to-day by taking what she needed.  Christina Ricci is also very good playing Lee's naive and dependent girlfriend, Selby.

Somehow, they find love in a completely believable way.  In addition, the story is rivetting. To maintain their life style and express her rage, Theron goes on a murderous rampage of robbery and murder, after killing a brutal rapist.  In a way, she is searching for justice, but gets crazier as she continues and feels increasingly desperate to maintain Ricci's love, which is perhaps the only good thing she has ever known and yet based on the cash that Theron brings in.

Let me be the first to say it- Theron's award winning performance is one of the worst to ever win an Oscar- it is not deep, nor scary, and even lacks the essential redeeming silliness of a Hannibal Lecter or Freddy Krueger. This film is one of those that people are just agog at, and so at odds with the Hollywood machine and its fawning parade of acolyte critics, that no one has the guts to say it's terrible. And, worst of all, every time I think about the film, and Theron's performance, it slides down another notch in my mind, just like so-called feminists who see a hero in Aileen Wuornos. That said, the Monster referred to in the title of the film most aptly applies to the film itself. Avoid this tripe!",1221350400,,1531,4.451957295373665

The beautiful Charlize Theron is almost unrecognizable, but superbly acted as Aileen, as is Christina Ricci in the role of Selby, her lesbian lover.

Anyone familiar with the actual case will appreciate the back story of Aileen's early life which is properly presented in this film. The viewer may feel an amount of sympathy when she begins her vengence; you've heard the expression ""some people just need killin',"" and that certainly applies in that sad instance. But Ms. Wuornos, unsuccessful in a quest for a ""normal"" job as she tries to maintain a comfortable lifestyle for herself and Selby, descends into the dark world of sequential murder on a regular basis in order to survive.

Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci fall in love, and I am so happy.  Then the proverbial s41t hits the fan, and the unhappy hooker (Theron) goes psycho.

You thought some of your ex-s and lovers were tough?  The unhappy hooker, a delusional loser, finds a second chance, gains romance, then goes off the deep end.  Christina Ricci is young, naive, and runs away to live happily ever after with her girlfriend.  Stop the movie, and all is well.  Continue the movie, and experience the result of way too much pent up aggression literally exploding.  The hooker struggles desperately to retain her new life, love, and she tries to go straight.

Without education, the hooker thinks she can waltz into an office and simply attain a real job.  She has no education, credentials, or manners, so the real world is much tougher than she expected.  Trying to make a nice home for her young lover, she strives to provide.  Sounds like a nice drama or romance to cuddle up to, eh?

Suffice to say that the hooker kills the mood.  Poor little (maybe not so naive) Christina Ricci becomes tough, and things progressively get weirder.

If you don't dig the psycho drama, tension, or criminal theme, you may enjoy the lesbian romance as it unfolds in unusual ways.",1206144000,2,1363,4.764957264957265
1518169,4,B00005JMUK,"One thing I'd never thought I'd see was Charlize Theron holding an acting Oscar.  That isn't meant to be an insult to the actress; it's just to say that based on her filmography I didn't expect her to be handed such an iconic role.  The iconic role that I am referring to is of course her brilliant turn as Aileen Wuornos, the hooker turned serial killer, in Patty Jenkins `Monster'.

When you watch Theron in `Monster' you are immediately blown away by the physical transformation she undertook.  All her undeniable beauty (she is one of the most spellbinding beauties in Hollywood) is stripped bare of her to expose the ugliness that consumed this woman.  Her skin is yellowed and loose; her eyes are small and beady; her hair is thin and coarse; her voice is gruff yet vulnerable; her waist has expanded...but beyond any prosthetics there lies a `performance' for the ages.  Charlize Theron brilliantly captured the woman that was Aileen Wuornos.  Her mannerisms, her speech, her attitude; everything that she was is projected on the audience with reckless abandon.

`Monster' recounts the events that led up to Wuornos arrestment and first death sentence (she received five more before her execution).  We see her lifestyle, most elements forced upon her by her childhood and early adolescence.  We see her desperation and apathy, both of which root themselves in her actions.  Then she meets Selby (based on Aileen's real life lover Tyra), a young nave girl who just wants someone to love her.  Wuornos is in a way just like Selby.  She has never truly been loved or understood by anyone, always being rejected and thrown away so-to-speak and so they immediately form a close bond, but that bond is tested almost as soon as it is formed.

After a brutal attack Wuornos discovers her inner monster.  In order to preserve her life and her hope of a future with Selby she murders her attacker in what proves to be the most intense and moving moment in the film (that one scene to me is what sealed Theron's Oscar...heartbreaking).  After crossing that line she finds that it's the most awful and grotesque things in life that prove to be the easiest to carry out.  Aileen has been degraded and abused since her conception but in the flash of the gun she finds that becoming the monster is so much easier then remaining the victim.  Determined to stop hooking altogether she runs off with Selby to start her life, but without an income and under pressure from Selby to `provide' for her she returns to the streets, this time with a new agenda.  Aileen has no intentions of giving these men anything more than a bullet.

I had really known nothing about Aileen Wuornos when I first saw `Monster' but since watching this film I've seen two documentaries and read some articles on her.  While the film for the most part remains true to Wuornos case there are some Hollywood fragmentations that can alter our perspective of this woman.  What is fact is that she was a very tortured woman who in the end snapped under the crushing powers of frustration and heartbreak.  She had lost so much, but then again never really had that much to begin with.  Her life was one never-ending slide towards pain and suffering and she couldn't take it anymore.  She was betrayed by the ones she loved and as the final frames capture her anguish as Selby testifies against her we are brought to the purest of sympathies for this convicted killer.

The film as a whole works in a devastating way, but a lot of this is due to Theron's magnificent performance.  Unlike `Boys Don't Cry', I don't feel `Monster' would have worked without Theron.  There are moments, especially towards the center of the film, that are almost `soap operaish' and that take away from the steely darkness of the film.  Parts move slower than they should and this can take away from overall impact of the film.  Once the film starts to spiral towards its climax though it never lets up.  The initial murder marks a moment of change not only in Aileen but in the film itself.  As we watch her scream and cry and parade around in utter misery and hostile confusion it's as if a switch goes off and the films pace starts to shift.

Jenkins is no Pierce (that is to say Kimberly Pierce, director of `Boys Don't Cry') but she does manage to extract Theron's finest performance ever; and by `ever' I mean `EVER'.

Aside from Theron there are some other well established performances.  Christina Ricci (an actress I expect one day to hold an Oscar) turns in a very well constructed turn as Selby, Aileen's love.  She can't really hold her own against Theron mostly because Charlize is so absorbing, but her final scenes are devastating and raw; just what this film needed.  A group of actors that I think should be singled out are those who portrayed the men who lost their lives to Aileen, especially Marco St. John and Scott Wilson.

`Monster' is not a flawless film but it is a solid three star film that deserves to be seen.  Charlize Theron's performance though is so flawless, so undeniably remarkable that she elevates this film to four stars, demanding that we give it a chance.  This is not an easy film to watch for it ravages the audience with brutality so repulsive yet so heartbreaking that our emotions are jumbled and confused.  Do we feel sympathies for this woman or do we feel anger towards her actions?  One thing is for certain, because of `Monster' everyone will know and remember Aileen Wuornos.",1204502400,5,5465,4.673640167364017
1518170,5,B00005JMUK,"The rage of Aileen Wournos is yanked from the past and and viciously strewn upon the screen.  Sweat, blood, tears--they're all shed here in brutal fashion.  This harrowing depiction packs a grip like a bull rider's and refuses to let you go.
This is due in large part to Charlize Theron's complete transformation.  She encompassses everything about the serial killer--her temper, mindset, hopes, fears, anxiety.  Her lack of education, her state of disarray.  And above all, her need to be loved.
Wournos unraveling from a desperate prostitute into a psychotic murderer ironically came shortly after meeting her female love interest, played with subtle precision by Christina Ricci.  It's easy to overlook her superb performance due to the overbearing presence of Theron.  But she is outstanding in this role as a naive, meager young woman who also needs some companionship.
The story progresses with sort of an edgy discomfort.  There are moments of humor, shock, disbelief, and pity.  There are times you'll be staring at the screen, unsure of how to react.  Kinda like when someone tells a joke that you don't really get.  The violence can knock you off balance.
I love how the momentum accelerates and doesn't let up.  It plunges through the murders like a runaway train.  Aileen was a startling head case, ready to derail at any given moment.
Overall, this movie will cause vastly different reactions.  Some might conceive it as an anti-death penalty statement.  Others might simply sit back and say well, justice was done.  I think the director tries to make the viewer see some of the reasons behind the ""Monster's"" madness.  Her actions aren't condoned(with one possible exception), but hopefully this story will provoke a certain degree of empathy.  Quite an absorbing account of this true story, with the best female acting tandem that I have ever seen.  Highly recommended.",1203465600,10,1884,5.078175895765472
1518171,5,B00005JMUK,"Sometimes there comes a film that just makes you want to go take a shower because you need to after watching it.  No, not those types of movies, I'm talking about those movies that suck you in and make you feel like your part of the movie from beginning to end and don't let go till the credits role. I felt this way after seeing Charlize Theron's performance in Monster, a well acted, well crafted film from Patty Jenkins.

For those of you who didn't follow the story during Oscar time a few years ago, the performance and transformation of Ms. Theron is amazing and a earns over her Best Actress Academy Award several times over.  The movie follows the criminal rise of serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute in Daytona Beach, FL.  After a life full of curve balls, we first met Aileen under an overpass waiting to kill herself with a rusty old revolver, the only thing that stops her is her thoughts to spend the money she made on a John a few hours before hand.  At a local gay bar, she meets Selby (Christina Ricci) a local lesbian girl living in Florida with family friends.  Selby's life isn't great either, she can't work due to a broken arm, she is trying to escape her father and a life of dullness in Ohio and her boarders at the home don't approve of her lifestyle.  After a night of heavy drinking, Selby and Aileen become fast friends on a track to become lovers.  Aileen convinces Selby to move out and live with her on the streets.  Selby hesitantly agrees to this venture and we begin a journey with Selby and Aileen.  Selby soon learns that Aileen has killed a man for brutally rapping her and stole his money, but Aileen is apologetic and tells Selby it was in self defense and that it would never happen again.

Aileen begins to try and make her life turn for the better, she applies for jobs all over the Daytona Beach region and is turned down, cruelly is some cases, and this only fuels her rage.  Aileen decided to go back to hooking on the streets and highways but decides to kill the Johns before the sex act and takes their money and cars.  Eventually, this begins to catch up to Aileen and Selby as they start to run all over the state, trying to avoid the law.  Aileen is eventually caught and sentenced to be executed by the state of Florida.

To find a fault with this film would be hard.  If any, I would have to say that Selby could have been fleshed out a little more but her character is not lacking in development but pales in comparison to Aileen in back story and motivation.  The work of director Patty Jenkins (who also wrote the script) is well done, crafting a tale of murders that allows room for motive and reasoning behind the ones we see on screen.  Ms. Theron and Ms. Ricci are both excellent in playing their characters; especially the emotion between the two and the acceptance to what Aileen becomes towards the end of the film is noticeable.

Ms. Theron's performance is the highlight of the film.  Not only her physical transformation but also her emotions on screen make you cringe after each murder we watch her commit.  As the writer, Ms. Jenkins does an excellent job letting us into Aileen's head and explaining motivations to us.  Aileen begins to rationalize her actions after each killing, talking to herself in a fast and worried voice and as the killings and her confidence progress; she begins to tell her victims why she is doing what she does before she kills them.  As a whole, Ms. Theron's performance should rank among the all time greats.

The other actors in this film excel when ever they are on screen and there isn't a down performance among them.  Bruce Dern's role as Aileen's male friend/confidante is good and would probably be great if he had more screen time.  The strong supporting role of Christina Ricci is a sight to see playing the mousy and shy Selby who gains confidence and feeds off Aileen's own bravado increases, only to collapse once again once Aileen succumbs to the manhunt for her and gives up.

Watching this movie makes you wonder exactly how the victim's families feel.  Most of the men we see killed on screen were married and had families.  Yet they were killed brutally in the act of soliciting sex from a prostitute and left for dead, even some of these men in the film make lewd request to Aileen before she is about to render her services.  You have to wonder if these scenes were those made by Ms. Jenkins in the writing process or taken form transcripts of Aileen Wuornos to the police and how they reacted seeing these scenes on film.

All in all, this movie can be summed up this way: Great for a viewer who enjoys a movie with strong performances and strong dialogue, though the movie is violent and does not blink when looking into the life that Aileen has lead.",1195516800,2,4776,4.474048442906574

1518204,5,B00005JMUK,"""Monster"" delves into the mind of the first female serial killer, Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron.) But it does not condone what she did or take sides. Instead, the film describes her life over the nine months after she found love with Selby (Christina Ricci); from 1989 to 1990. I really liked the narration/voiceover that Charlize did (as Aileen.) It lent a little credence to the movie and some humanity to Aileen, as well.

Charlize Theron very rightfully won the Academy Award for her portrayal of Aileen Wuornos. Charlize completely metamorphosed her entire look which was so eerie and uncanny because it was impossible to tell that she was acting in a movie. She also changed the sound of her voice, sounding exactly like the women she played. Charlize is a true actress and very deserving of the Best Actress nod from the Academy. Christina Ricci was also excellent playing the shy and introverted Selby, and has proven herself to be a very accomplished cinema actress.

The movie follows the tale of harried and hopeless Aileen Wuornos as she tries to pick up the pieces of her shattered and tattered life. When Aileen meets Selby it was almost love at first sight. Selby practically saved her life and for that Aileen was forever in her debt. I think my favorite scene was when they were together in the bed (that first night they met) and Selby asks Aileen if she could touch her face. Aileen seemed so sensitive and gentle.

Besides that horrible rape scene and other depictions of degradation (I really hated that scene with that scumbag cop that picked her up after her job interview), I also found the scenes when Aileen tried to look for work very bitter. No one would give her a chance or listen to her. She had no money, no education, no family; absolutely nothing. All the doors were loudly slammed in her face. Society gladly threw Aileen Wuornos away. She was just another hooker, why did it matter that she wanted to clean up her act? Charlize was especially perfect during these parts. Her look of rage, and total desperation was purely obvious.

Another aspect of this story that I found terribly sad was when Selby turned her back on Aileen. Aileen loved her more than her own life and she finally thought that she had a chance of happiness. Maybe Aileen also thought that she finally found a person that she could honestly trust. Maybe if Aileen never met Selby she would still be alive today?

I really liked the way the movie ended. It wasn't too deep or sad, instead I found it very surreal because it wasn't too weighty. The movie ended the way it started, with Aileen narrating to the viewers in her own sarcastic and comical way.

""Monster"" did make me feel sorry for Aileen because she was obviously an incredibly broken person that was never given a fighting chance. Someone please tell me why is Aileen vilified while these horrible men that raped her and sexually abused her aren't? Whoever said it's a man's world sure wasn't kidding.",1184112000,30,2971,4.6928982725527835

1518207,3,B00005JMUK,"The film follows the life Aileen Wuornos( Charlize Theron), a female prostitute, who in the 1980's and the 1990's, kills 7 different men over the course of months. It also shows a relationship she had at the time with a woman (Christina Ricci) and how the murders tore their relationship apart.

Depressing. That is the first word that went into my head after I got up and left the cinema when I went to see this back in 2003. I also felt digust and had a sense of being dirty. In the car, I didn't speak about it to my companion that was feeling the same thing that I was. The film hits the mark dead on with the feelings and the emotions and the acting. When you are done with this movie, you walk out of it feeling ""Why did I see that?"" because it is one of the darkest stories I have ever seen told on the screen. It makes you feel bad. It just makes your skin crawl over. There is not a single bone in my body that was creeped out by what I had seen in that.

Patty Jenkins, for a first time director, introduces nothing new to the film world. She has so-so direction that is highlighted by Theron's amazing transformation into Wuornos. The only way that a person can say they got something out of the film was to look at Theron's performance and say ""that is the only good thing, her performance."" The reason why the film was critically acclaimed was by her performance, and performance only. The performance was what set the film. You weren't watching the other actors take their turn. You were watching Theron in awe as she displays the sickening life of the murder that she was ask to portray. The writing itself was mediocre and was all over the place, it took Theron's character and developed her the most while leaving other characters with little or no development at all. Like I said, it was a star making vehicle for Charlize Theron like Risky Business was for Tom Cruise or The Hustler was for Paul Newman. The film focuses mostly on Theron and never lets up.

Theron's performance was amazing, in a word. She takes the character and develops the mannerisms of the person and the personality also. She makes you hate and feel for her at the same time the development of the character shows towards the end of the film when Aileen looks back in desperation of getting a last glimpse of her lover.

Overall, the film make me depressed, but I was in awe of Charlize's performance and was glad that she won the Oscar for it, because before this, she really hadn't impressed me with her other films as they hadn't any challenging roles that she could free herself in as a actress.

1518208,5,B00005JMUK,"'Monster' is a marvelous movie because Charlie Theron plays her character with such thorough knowledge and conviction that we are convinced that we're watching prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos like it was done the first time.  Add to the fact that writer/director Patty Jenkins makes all the right moves to tell the story without softening or sermonizing, and you have yourself a movie classic.  Surely, it's not easy stuff to take in, but it's so interesting, one becomes glued to the heartaching tragedy in every detail.  Much like 'Dead Man Walking,' this film brims with authenticity and assembles itself with an unflinching camera and leaves the audience to judge in its aftermath.

Having been a prostitute since age 13 and having been disowned and abused in numerous ways, Aileen can only earn a living on the way she was brought up.  Having to face a particularly nasty ""John"" she overreacts but at least has a plausible self-defense argument to muster.  Having a desperate challenge for tenderness and money, she comes upon a lesbian, Shelby (played with excellent tension by Christina Ricci) from a devout Christian household when she stumbles into a gay bar.  Trying a little tenderness her occupation lacks, she enters a relationship her original proclivities forbade.  Finding rare compassion her storage unit landlord, Tom (played effectively by Bruce Dern) and striking a partnership with Shelby, she, nevertheless, goes down a slippery slope; one that makes her a modern MacBeth with more fate following her than ambition.

It can't be said enough how well-rounded and detailed Theron's performance is made.  Capturing pathos and desperation, 'Monster' reveals the rationalizations and roadblocks that make this story such a masterpiece in unsettling anguish.",1177545600,,1786,5.301418439716312

Patty actually went to Aileen's hometown to talk with the people who loved Aileen. Patty looked at lots of photos of Aileen and when you watch this movie the resemblance between the real Aileen Wuornos and Charlize Theron is amazing!! The make-up was done so well on everyone. Another reason why I love this film is because Charlize just kind of disappeared into the roll of Aileen Wuornos she played Aileen Wuornos very well! Christina Ricci played Selby Aileen's lover (Aileen's former girlfriend' real name was not used in the film for reasons unknown by me.) Christina also gave an amazing performance in this film I mean the actresses and actors really knew how to draw you in!

This movie is important as a cinematic achievement - the seedy underbelly of lower class Florida is absolutely depressing as one of the important elements of this story that the director nails, as well as for its unflinching look at the utter darkness residing inside Aileen Wuornos. The director does not force the viewer to conclude whether this darkness is intrinsic to her particular personality and is in some way ""loosed"" by the agony of her particular story, or whether, having never been treated as a real human being, that she is just ""one of us"" with a different context. - blogophobe-",1174262400,,1055,4.932584269662922

The physical presence of Theron's character is brilliant; this is an artist who transcends her own physical beauty, sacrificeses it by gaining weight for the ultimate reward: perfect characterization.  There is no trace of Theron left, only the high strung serial killer bent on living the life she longs for, while systematically ruining it with murder and prostitution. Ricci does a wonderful job as the unwitting ""lover"", and optimistically blinds herself to the dangerous aspects of Wuornos' out of control life. The random ugliness of prostitution is a stark contrast to the intimate and tender relationship between the two women; the violence bred into an abused woman is sad and terrifying to witness.  The disasterous results are sobering and thought provoking. This performance by Charlize Theron demonstrates the very best of what acting is all about. Truly, one of the premiere performances of our time.  100% recommended!",1170633600,,1291,5.303921568627451

1518257,4,B00005JMUK,"Upon renting this movie, I expected something along the lines of ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" with some psychology and some serial killin'.  I was surprised to find very little actual killin' in this film, and a whole lot of psychology.  This movie is a character study, not a plot-driven narrative.  As such, it provides Charlize Theron with a real actor's showcase.  She takes full advantage of it, turning in a fantastic performance.  Christina Ricci does a fine job, too.  Given that we spend most of the movie with these two, their performances are critical, and they bring it strong.

What I didn't like about this movie was its lack of plot.  It meandered around a bit much for me, and became a little tedious in points.  Also, it was a little too sympathetic to Wuornos.  It's clear how she got to where she was, but she is portrayed as a complete victim who at no point (well, perhaps one) has any control over her choices.

1518259,5,B00005JMUK,"This movie is disturbing...incredibly disturbing...It is the story of serial killer Aileen Wuornos...but you knew that already. Aileen is used and abused all of her life and then she snaps and she starts her killing spree. Being a Spiritual Practitioner I encourage every one to take 100% complete and total responsibility for their lives and yet even though I encourage this, I know that some things are not so black and white. The sad fact is, that people do use us, they do abuse us, they do confuse us and sometimes we are walking a very thin line between sanity and insanity.

Sometimes, it's a wonder how most of us have made it this far without snapping.

I had a situation where I was involved with an abusive person. This person made me feel small, inadequate, and totally worthless. I was relatively young when a lot of this happened, but I can clearly remember going to bed one night swearing to myself that if this person didn't knock it off, one day they were going to be sorry.

Fortunately, that person died before the rage within me completely boiled over. And yet even though this person had died, there was still this anger, this bitterness, this hardness that was growing over me that could have infected my entire world but instead of taking it out on others, I took it out on myself in various forms and dresses and it was only until I got a small glimpse that maybe I was worthy...maybe I was deserving...maybe I was good enough to have love and respect and appreciation for myself, that all of this hate, all of this bitterness, all of this rage dissolved from a true and honest willingness to forgive this person that had violated my psyche and not let them abuse me any more.

I don't approve of what Aileen Wuornos did, but I also don't judge her. This truth is, that she was all too human and yes, her acts may have been considered ""monstrous"" and horrible, but were the acts that were done on her any less horrible? This movie will make you question your life right down to the marrow of your bones. I know that after watching this, I had several fitful nights of sleep, I was very troubled, and very upset. Who knows how my life would've been if somehow the power of Grace hadn't stepped in?

We are all capable of being monsters, but the Truth is, the real Truth is, that we are much more capable of being angels. Aileen Wuornos is now an angel. She didn't go to hell. She was in hell while she was here and because God is a God of Love, God's Love redeemed her and gave her yet another opportunity to begin.

This is what Grace is all about.

1518260,3,B00005JMUK,"Perhaps priviledged isn't the appropriate descriptor, but I happened this week, to experience two films that both reek of murder and whose protagonists give astonishing performances in the course of their tragic undoing. But any parallelism diverges at this point. It's not that,'Monster' deals with a white-trash loser and,'Fists In The Pocket' with middleclass dysfunction. Or that the former is from southern U.S.A and the latter from Northern Italy. And discount the forty years that seperate their appearances. And colour versus black and white. Whatever all these factors contribute to visionary status, clearly Bellocchio's,'Fists' has it and Jenkin's,'Monster' is void of it. I can only imagine that Bellochio's investment, his poetic grappling and empathy with his 'monster' is total. we feel the disturbance in every nuance of the film, its rhythms, lighting, angles, editing. You could say that the murder/directror's consciousness is spread into every cranny of its making: that form is interlocked with content. While Jenkins's 'monster', for all her gravitas, remains spectacle, endistanced, horrific, but only as affecting as a tabloid header. Theron is terrific as the whore driven to destructive distraction. But by comparison with Lou Castel's character, the work is hers alone. Criterion have done us a service in digitally restoring a high-definition copy of a neglected masterwork that, for all my devotion to 60s Italian cinema, completely passed me by.",1159833600,,1475,5.56
1518261,5,B00005JMUK,"Charlize Theron, as is widely known, is superb in this film, for which she won the Academy Award for best actress. With a little help from the artists in make-up, she transforms herself into Aileen Wuornos, Daytona Beach prostitute turned serial killer (a true story; Wuornos was executed for seven murders in 2002 after spending 12 years on FLorida's death row). Christina Ricci is also brilliant as Wuornos' naive and vulnerable lesbian lover. There is little I can add to the comments of other viewers about the amazing quality of the acting, which extends beyond the protagonists to the talented men who play Wuornos' various ""johns."" Special kudos go to Marc Macaulay and Scott Wilson (who plays the last ""john"" with breathtaking poignance).

The DVD also includes a very enlightening featurette on the making of the film, which I highly recommend, narrated chiefly by Theron and director/writer of the film, Patty Jenkins. I learned from watching this extra feature, for example, that the movie was shot on the actual sites where the real events took place and that Theron and Jenkins met and interviewed many acquaintances of Wuornos in the process. As both Theron and Jenkins explain, they came to understand that they could only tell a part of the horrifying story of Wuornos' evolution from abused and abandoned child to killer. To that end, the script is remarkable in conveying Wuornos' story with sympathy while not attempting to glorify or excuse her slide to the dark side. The events of her early life that damaged her so extensively are narrated indirectly through dialogue and description, which I think was a good choice, because we never come to feel that any one experience explains or justifies the monster she became.

One of the best movies I've seen.",1159056000,2,1775,4.973063973063973
1518262,4,B00005JMUK,"If I could only use one word to describe the feeling I had when watching 'Monster', that would be it.  Painful.  As I watched the account of this woman's life I was in constant agony for I felt for her and her situation, her horrific lot in life.  Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) is not the monster here.  The monster is the life she led, the life forced upon her, the life that ate at her everyday.  Aileen, prostitute since thirteen, never knew anything more than what she had, and as the film opens we see that she is about to take her own life because of this, that was until she meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci).  Selby (real name was Tyria Moore) is a closet lesbian who wants to come out against the will of her overbearing parents.  She meets Aileen in a gay bar, a place apparently Aileen was unaware was a gay bar, but after they meet they lose something they've felt their whole life...they no longer feel lonely, alone.

In order to keep Selby by her side Aileen turns back to prostitution but after being abused horrifically by a 'John' Aileen makes a change.  That's when the murders begin, and even though some are not justified and some are heartbreaking (especially when she murders and innocent man out of pure fear and hopelessness) you never feel as though she deserves what she gets.  She didn't deserve the hand she was dealt and its heart wrenching to see her have to go through everything she went through.  Yes, it's true that not all women who are raped by their father figure turn out to be murderers, but I don't feel that's the reason she killed.  There is so much we don't know about the woman that was Aileen Wuornos, but from Charlize's brilliant performance we gather that she was afraid, she was alone, she was confused and she was emotionally dieing if not already dead.  She had been abused in everyway possible and thrown out without a chance, without a care in the world, even by the ones she loved the most (most notably Selby).

This is a truly heartbreaking and, yes, painful film to watch but it's one that we all do well to experience to know the tragedy we ourselves are at times too guarded (and judgmental) against.",1154908800,,2164,4.487244897959184
1518293,4,B00005JMUK,"The centerpiece of this film is Charlize Theron's stunning portrayal of Aileen Wuornos -- a Florida prostitute who murdered 7 murders in 1990 - thus becoming America's first female serial killer. Theron's transformation from Hollywood beauty to forty-something burned-out highway hooker occurs inside and out. While makeup can depict weather-battered skin, and a few extra pounds can take the bloom off the rose, Theron becomes alternatingly swaggering and pitiable, melting into the tottering psyche of Aileen. Her perpetually down-turned smile is both a mark of inner pride and an expression of the bravado that she needs to survive emotionally.

As depicted in the movie, from a tender age Aileen craved for acceptance and love. The men in her life, from her abusive father to her schoolmates, only abuse her. The closest she comes to love is in letting men use her body in every degrading way imaginable. She prowls the highways, selling sexual favors for pitifully small amounts of cash. But after years of this degrading work, one trick turns violent and Aileen guns down her assailant. This seems to empower her in a way she has never experienced, and she continues to kill for money, partly to avoid hustling, partly to support her young paramour, and partly for revenge. It's not hard to see where this not-too-bright, friendless, alcoholic and unconnected person will end up.

As seen in the DVD featurette, writer/director Patty Jenkins connects strongly with Aileen. Jenkins sees Aileen as a victim whose world has cut off every avenue of escape. Jenkins also sees in Aileen the desperate need of every human being to be loved. When Aileen meets Shelby (Christina Ricci) it seems that for the first time she has a chance to hope and dream of something better than hustling truckers and married men. Whether the film accurately portrays the true Aileen Wuornos is something I cannot answer. In fact, Jenkins's attempt to tell the ""larger truth"" about Aileen practically screams ""agenda-driven distortion!"" A larger truth than Jenkins's may be that when you make a film about people (including the men Aileen murdered) it is important to depict them fairly and accurately. Whether Jenkins did that, or just chose to take the word of a likely psychotic, drug-addicted, emotionally damaged woman is the big question. By choosing to ignore Aileen's drug problem (replacing it with excessive alcohol consumption) or her ever-shifting testimony about the murders provides an insight into Jenkins's possible agenda.

Nevertheless, as a story of how a victimized human being whose last shred of self-respect comes exploding from the barrel of a gun, the movie is affecting and upsetting. As an unvarnished look at the humiliations and trials of the disposable people that some use for their gratification, it is troubling and moving. Viewers must ponder the question of the identity of the ""monster"" of the title. Is it Aileen, washed-up loser, prostitute and deranged serial killer? Or the men and communities that trampled her human dignity? And if the answer is ""both,"" then what do we do with monsters we willingly create?",1154390400,4,3129,5.131372549019608

1518298,4,B00005JMUK,"Simply put I'm a guy that loves his horror movies and murderous villains found within. Yet, despite this morbid fascination that I, and dare i say many others have, i find no other villain more mesmerizing than the real life villains that live amongst us, that we at any time could really become a victim too.

Sadly, Hollywood has distorted some of these villains (i.e. yea Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw was based loosely on Ed Gein but its hard to believe he was the unkillable killing machine found in the movies). In MONSTER you watch as the horror of Aileen Carol Wuornos unfold (the scary part about the movie is that they made it more pleasant than it probably was in real life).

Here is a woman that had a father who was a child molester, her mother abandoned her to her abusive grandparents, which may or may not have physically and sexually abused her, she alleges she had sex with her brother, she used drugs and was suicidal, she gave her firstborn up for adoption at age 14, oh and did i forget to mention she prostituted for over a decade, since the age of 13, and needless to say rapes, along with other horrors ensued during this period.

As you watch, part of you wants to feel that she gets what she deserves in the hardships that play out in her life, you feel that she is worthless trash not worthy of the air she breaths, yet when she meets naive lesbian Selby Wall (wonderfully played by  Christina Ricci) you realize that all Aileen Wuornos ever wanted in life, was to be loved, which Selby Wall is all to willing to give, as a lonely young woman pressured by her overzealous and religious family .

By the way this may well rate as the best work Charlize Theron has ever done (she actually put on thirty pounds to play the role). Wuornos at first gives up her former ways of selling herself, wanting to live an honest life and take care of Selby. Sadly, we come to realize that although her motives are pure, the only thing she knows how to do is prostitue and must return to the life she once hated in order to keep the love of her life. But soon after, during a 'date' gone bad Wuornos and Selby's lives fall apart.

The question i was left with after watching this movie was why the heck was it made (i mean why give a serial killer more press); but was left to ponder as i did when i watched the end of 'Natural Born Killers', in that society makes these killers, yet we scream for justice when they snap and lash out at the very society that helped make them. I mean really with the upbringing she had what would one expect her to grow up to be; a glowing socialite at the local country club(which ironically she had a chance to do when she married a wealthy 69 year-old yacht club president Lewis Fell, in '76 who later had the marriage anulled)? But i digress..Sorry.

Simply put the acting was great, the story completely mesmerizing, and i dare to say better than anything you'll see in the theater, right now. So if you enjoy an awesome story, or are looking to get an inside view of the MONSTERS that are being made today, possibly next door and across the street from you (with that family you think are just living the Clean Cut American Dream) check this movie out.

1518299,4,B00005JMUK,"I feel that's the whole story of Aileen Wournos. Nortorious prostitute/serial killer. The story was a rather sad one because I can relate to the fact that it seems as though the deck was stacked against her, and no one really seemed to know what to do with helping her, and at times no one seemed to really care. Born in Michigan to a dysfunctional family whose father committed suicide when she was rather young; she gets bounced around all over the place, and along the way she is raped, molested, and gives birth to a child at 13, and then has to put it up for adoption. The allegations are dismissed, and what's worse she's blamed, and thrown out into the snow. She's been humiliated, rejected, violated, and all society can tell her is to turn to God, go to church, deal with it, move on. She does all that, and the end result is she's dumped on even more. It's like she's told that this is what her life's all about that God ordained it; mind you the words weren't uttered, but the sentiment was there. She tries to do honest work, but it doesn't pan out, and men just have a intense hatred towards her and her kind. She decides it doesn't pay to have a relationship with a man, so she turns to a woman named Shelby Wall whose own life is very fragile right now as her legalistic religious family is trying to deprogram her from the lesbian lifestyle, and there's no love for her. Aileen and Shelby find each other, and little by little they fall in love, but Shelby is completely in the dark about Aileen's double life, and in an attempt to tell the truth ends up betraying Aileen. Aileen as portrayed by Charlize Theron was done rather well. Worthy of an oscar. She shows Aileen's attempt to be the kind of woman she always dreamed about: the kind, the holy, the compassionate woman, but the demons of abuse self and infliced on her would not let her go. She tends to show she doesn't trust her own instincts especially when she was told by her true friend that he wanted to get away with her, but she took it to be not pure in motive, but not realizing that the other men around her were 2 undercover police officers. I feel that the one thing that held down Aileen was her inability to realize that her life was made of choices...her choices. She certainly had to make the final decisions of her life, but with no one to love and nurture her she was lost. She had a heart on certain things, and with certain people, but if they were violent towards her they got a one way ticket to the lake of fire, and that was with murder, but with others she had a soft spot like the one who didn't have any money, and she jacked on him to give him relief. I know that her experiences do not warrant murder, but if someone reached out to her she wouldn't have had to murder, but it looks as though no one did. I guess Aileen felt like in the end that Society had to tell her something because we're all human, and it's better to cover up the dirty deeds with something new than to expose everyone's sins. I'm talking about those who used her body for impure motives, beat her up for their own inadequacies, and rejecting her from jobs, from life, and from relationships. Of course the ending seemed choppy, and didn't do much of a courtroom drama, but that's rather good; that's what Lifetime's for. She's convicted, and sentenced to death; I'm sure that Shelby's betrayal was too much for her, and I often wonder what she did for the 12 years on death row? Did she go to the chamber with her heart mind and life unshackled?, or was she as bitter as the day she was when she was thrown out into the streets as a child? I can relate because at times I feel with people's advice that I'm given it's mostly ""They Have To Tell Me Something."" I really don't know why, but I'm sure it's because we're all supposed to believe in something....that's like an unwritten rule, and if you don't believe in anything then that's like telling others ""Life Isn't Worth Living."" It wasn't as dark as I first thought, but it was dark enough. It was a rather excellent piece of movie of a woman who's death sentence was widely celebrated as parties throughout Florida were thrown to toast the death of woman whose crime was making bad choices on how to deal with abuse. As I said I feel for Aileen, but it's no excuse for murdering others. This is a story all abusers should watch.

1518301,4,B00005JMUK,"The two main characters in Monster are people who will never touch happiness. They may have seen happy people, had enjoyable moments, and grasp what it may mean to be happy, but the harder they fight towards it, the further away they get from it.

In one of the most dramatic and successful transformations in film history, Charlize Theron plays Aileen Wuornos, a short-tempered, ugly, slow-witted, pathetic prostitute. She is on the verge of suicide when she is hit on by Selby (Christina Ricci), a frumpy, weak willed lesbian. At first Aileen violently rejects Selby's advances, but before long they are making out in an alley behind the bar. Aileen probably isn't a lesbian, but she has been used, beaten, or raped by nearly every man she has ever known, so accepting the love of another woman isn't too hard.

Of course, their relationship itself is hard, as neither has any money nor a place to go that would accept them. One night, a john ties up Aileen and begins to rape her, but she manages to grab the gun she carries and shoot her attacker dead. She ditches the body and swipes his car and money, and for a few days, her and Selby enjoy booze and a hotel room. Aileen dresses as nicely as she can and applies for a few secretary positions, though her complete lack of credentials or charm ensures that she can't get a job. Desperate to keep Selby around, she goes back to hooking, and before she knows it she has blown another one of her johns away, and with his money can continue being with Selby just a bit longer.

Aileen keeps coming back to the house with new cars and more money than her tricks could provide, but Selby isn't the type to ask difficult questions. Aileen is surprised by how easy it is just to kill these men and empty their wallets; she has been abused by men, and now they are getting their just desserts. Aileen always talks to Selby with the conviction of someone who sees the light at the end of the tunnel, swearing that soon they can move somewhere nicer, eat at better restaurants, and inhabit that happy world the two of them have only seen through others. When Selby finds out exactly what Aileen is doing, she protests; shortly afterwards, Aileen returns home without as much money as expected, and Selby demands Aileen head right back out and score another car.

Theron does an amazing job with Aileen, who comes across as truly despicable, yet with a desire for something better that is easy to relate to. Everything in her life has been terrible, and when she finally finds someone who makes her feel good, she can't help but promise the moon and then try her hardest to provide it. Aileen rarely sees anything as her fault, and maybe not everything is, though when she shoots a kind Christian man who offered her shelter at his family's house through the back of the head, childhood rape is a tough sell.

Through voiceover, she tells us that people think she has taken the easy way out by being a hooker, but that she hasn't, as being a hooker is hard work. She may believe this, but it isn't so; by murdering these men, she is indeed taking the easy way out instead of improving herself the hard way, as is Selby for lapping up the promises this wretched creature flings out at her. Consistently, both Aileen and Selby have lived their lives in terrible circumstances, and look feverishly for the easiest way they can to get out.

Monster is entertaining, sad, heart-breaking, and revolting. Entertaining because of its masterful performances and direction, sad because we know that the story is true, heart-breaking because we see the squalor in which its characters inhabit, and revolting as we see them murder in cold blood and then belligerently make excuses. Monster is one of the best films about a murderer ever made, revealing the human story of Aileen, and leaving no doubt that she turned out to be worse than those who wronged her.",1142467200,,3892,4.600864553314121
1518302,5,B00005JMUK,"If you have not seen Charlize Theron 'channel' Aileen Wuornos in the film Monster, you are in for an amazing film experience. This performance by Theron will become legendary, much like Robert DeNero's legendary acting in Raging Bull. Let me explain why I found this film to be exceptional: When I read a book or see a film, I watch for the manner in which the writer,director, and actors portray the characters.  The more justice shown and compassion shown, generally the more I like the work. I am not  convinced of pure evil or pure charity or pure innocenence or pure revenge. Charlize Theron allows us to see the terribly twisted youth and adolescence of Aileen, the series of bad breaks and miscalculations, and yet we also see her crimes as unnecessary, especially all her murders after the first murder. She did kill a sadistic rapist in self defense in her first homocide, but unfortunately this melts into a series of murders. It is when a good Samaratan type of family man picks her up thinking that she is really a person in need of help, and circumstances come together so that Aileen chooses to kill him also, that we see her final sentence is just and we can leave the end of the film with a sense of closure.

Christina Ricci plays the lost lesbian girl that was Eileen's partner in these final months and during the murder spree. She does a good job of playing the rebellious teenager, rebelling against any boundaries and yet dependent on the adult world for her meals and clothing and shelter.

The film will make you sad and maybe even angry. I become angry when I think about the physical and sexual mistreatment of children and how these experiences may destroy a life course or life path.

After having seen interviews with the real Aileen Wuornos in Life and Death of a Serial Killer ( a film based on personal interviews with the real ""Monster"" ), I realize what an Outstanding performance Charlize Theron gave. Also, heads up to the make up artists for transforming beautiful Charlize into looking strikenly like Aileen. Charlize well deserves the award she won for her performance in this true story. What a perfect pick! I have to say also that the character of Selby ( played by Christina Ricci ) was well played. As everyone must know by now, this film is a true story about America's first female serial killer. Although the movie does not go back into Aileen's ( Lee ) childhood, the viewers can sense that this woman must have had a rough life. The movie starts where she meets Selby in a bar and they soon become lovers. What Selby doesn't know is that Lee is a killer.... at least not until later in the movie. Lee spent most of her time as a highway prostitute in Florida. After being picked up and raped by a John, she murdered him and stole his vehicle. This soon became a pattern for Lee and she had to kill over and over to get both cash and a new vehicle...... for she would get rid of the other vehicles soon after she took them so she wouldn't get caught in them. After wrecking a car with eyewitnesses at the scene, a sketch of Lee and Selby were put all over the news stations and Selby began to run scared. Lee got enough money for Selby to get on a bus and leave, while Lee remained there in Florida. The police eventually caught up with her and she was apprehended at her favorite local bar. Aileen was sentenced to death for the murder of 7 men. She was executed by lethal injection. If you like true stories and don't mind violence, I strongly recommend renting and buying this movie. I've seen alot of true stories made into movies but this one has to be one of the very best ever made. Great Movie!!!!!!!!!!!",1141257600,2,1985,4.367567567567567

How will we be aware of these people? how will we know that we should notice them and try to change them and help these people?

I won't give you a summary of the story, since so many people did. I just like to point out the explosive performance of Theron- how could you even imagine a model-like beauty could pull off a psychopath? The make-up certainly helped, but of course, all props to Theron, she definitely needed the Oscar, which she rightfully won.

The movie revealed that it's not true all serial killers are cold-blood murderers, as many of us like to believe, but the result of negative drives. I'm not justifying for Aileen's actions, they were definitely wrong, but she definitely needed help. If she didn't have an abusive childhood or had recieved professional help, she probably would never have ended up this way. I think it's completely true that while Aileen's action is her own, maybe we all share a part of the responsiblity; while she's wrong in killing people, the people who drove her mentally mad to do it also did a very wrong thing.

Monster truly is a masterpiece. But it may not be for everyone. People who do not like the idea of this aka. people who think there is a clear distinction of right and wrong, and that every action and cause of action is one's own, will not like this film. People don't like gruelsome killing movies will not like it, and people who generally don't like negative things will not like it. But that's why it's rated R.",1135987200,,1683,4.440129449838188
1518346,5,B00005JMUK,"The reason that this movie is so great is because of the grit and ugliness that inhabit it. While the majority of film's made are built around perfect landscapes and beautiful people, this film gets down to the nitty-gritty of the reality of modern society. This movies is not flowers and lace. It's more comparable to scum and mildew, but that is exactly what sets the film apart from the rest.

Charlize Theron's tranformation from the beautiful South African woman that she is, to a homely, non-descript woman is truly amazing. Her portrayl is so convincing of Aileen, that you hardly remember that it's Ms. Theron at all. Her usual sensuous voice takes on a tone of a decandant prostitue, with a butch overtone. Christina Ricci is also not to shabby in her role.

Even though the character of Aileen is such a horrendous person, Charlize Theron manages to pull at your heart strings. By the end of the film, you are filled with such sympathy for her character, that the murderous crimes that she has commited seem to not matter much anymore. You come to realize that even a person like her can have so much love for someone, that forgivness isn't forced, but utterly natural.

The movie has a tone of ugliness and darkness throughout. And really, that's what makes it such a brilliant movie. From the acting, to the plot, to the dialogue, its full of grit and scum, yet is developed into a true gem of a film.",1131321600,3,1413,4.599206349206349
1518347,5,B00005JMUK,"The film Monster depicts a story of a real life street prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  In her childhood, Aileen suffered from detrimental child abuse by close family members.  Her childhood made an effect into her adult life where the only mean for Aileen to support herself is through prostitution. At the near point of breakdown, Aileen met with Selby, a nave lesbian teenager at a local gay bar where they engaged into an odd relationship.  From that day on, Aileen tried to pick up with her life by finding a real job to support the relationship, but with her lack of job experience and education she was turned down by all interviewers.  The failure to finding a decent job winds Aileen back to working in the streets in order to uphold the relationship because of Selby self-centered and demanding personality.  On one night, the story intensified as Aileen was violently raped and beaten by one of her customers.  With anger and frustration, Aileen killed her rapist with a handgun in act of self-defense.  This mental excruciating experience marks the pain of her life and allows Aileen to develop strong hatred and anger toward men.  Nevertheless, Aileen continues to prostitute as a mean of providing financial support.  The progression of the movie continues showing Aileen's rage and frustration killing nearly all of her customers.  Her daunting rampage did catch up with her as she was captured and betrayed by Selby, who in the end turned Aileen to the authorities.

Miss Theron deserves every mark of complements for her great acting role.  Her language, gestures, posture, and attitudes throughout the film make the movie more interesting and intense, as is.  The director deserves a great applaude as well for her adaption on Aileen's life and bringing it into the screens.

1518348,4,B00005JMUK,"This controversial film is worth seeing, if only for Charlize Theron's outstanding, Academy Award winning performance. Ms. Theron totally loses herself in the character of Aileen Wuornos, the serial killer who murdered seven men in Florida and was arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. Aileen Wuornos was finally executed in 2002, after spending many years on death row.

The film details the hard knocks life led by Aileen Wuornos, from that of a troubled teenager looking for love in all the wrong places to that of a hard living prostitute. It also looks at the very human side of Aileen Wuornos, a woman who found love in the person of a troubled, young lesbian in her late teens (Christina Ricci), who would ultimately betray the trust that Aileen Wuornos believed lay between her and her eventual fate.

Ms. Theron's physical transformation is startling, though I found her still recognizable as Charlize Theron. It is her performance, however, rather than her physical transformation, that is more startling, as she infuses it with a high voltage intensity and swagger that bowls the viewer over. She makes the person of Aileen Wuornos come to life. She is a low rent individual, white trash to the core, prostituting herself by getting into cars in order to have sex with total strangers. So, this film is not for the fastidious, as we are looking at the seamy underbelly of the beast in this film, and it sure isn't pretty. It is also a credit to Ms. Theron's compelling performance that the viewer is able to feel pity for Aileen Wuornos, a woman who is so vile, yet, at the same time, so vulnerable and pathetic.

The direction is excellent in the film, as are all the supporting performances. Christina Ricci is very good as the weak, passive, troubled young woman with whom Aileen Wuornos enters into a lesbian love affair, a relationship which lasted years in real life rather than the short time depicted in the film. Ms. Ricci infuses the role with a certain amoral, vapid selfishness that makes the character's betrayal of Aileen Wuornos comprehensible. Bruce Dern, in the role of Thomas, Aileen Wuornos' only true friend, is a stand out, as he adds depth to an otherwise small role. It is clear that Thomas saw something in Aileen Wuornos that the rest of the world missed. It is the most decent relationship that Aileen Wuornos appears to have had.

The film itself, despite the stellar performances, is somewhat flawed, as it is unclear as to what made Aileen Wuornos tick, though it makes an attempt at deciphering her psyche. There are several theories that are exposed for the viewer to ponder: abused child, rape victim, and love sick puppet. They fall short of explaining adequately this troubled woman who would go on to achieve such notoriety. Notwithstanding this unresolved issue, the film is still a compelling one, though not one I would necessarily care to view again, as there is nothing at all uplifting about the disturbing and sordid life led by Aileen Wuornos. Consequently, I consider this film to be a one shot deal, despite the wonderful performances.",1130630400,,3105,4.875

1518350,4,B00005JMUK,"I was reluctant to see this movie b/c of all the violence I knew would be shown, but I'm so glad I saw it!  Charlize Theron was unbelievable and fantastic in the role of Aileen Wuernos.  She was not only unrecognizable, but completely transformed in every way as this woman.  Christina Ricci was good too, but not a terribly strong performance, by an actress who usually plays much stronger personality roles--usually nasty, selfish and manipulative.  By the end of the movie,I really had mixed feelings about the behavior of Aileen Wuernos.  When she's raped and beaten by the first ""john"" who she murderers, I was almost cheering for her in defending herself.  Then, she takes it too far of course by murdering all the ""johns"" she encounters.  Why not just rob them and steal their cars and then flee the state?  Resorting to murder every time showed her clear insanity and being oblivious to the reality of eventually getting caught.

I thought the scene where she does a ""favor"" for one of the policeman who stops when he sees her on the street and then ignores her crimes and doesn't arrest her was an important scene, showing how corrupt the police force can be, even in these types of situations.

An excellent movie and portrayal of a disturbed woman--I couldn't help but feel sorry for her at times and it was a very thought-provoking movie of our justice system and it makes you wonder if they chose the right solution for this woman's crimes.",1128816000,2,1453,4.68503937007874
1518351,5,B00005JMUK,"Charlize Theron's got down pat the foghorn voice and the wild gesticulation - like a drunken sailor attempting to restore circulation to all four limbs at once - proving to industry nay-sayers that when it comes to filling Michael Keaton's shoes, she is the most shoe-fillingest of all actresses.  She filled them, all right, and then some, taking home the gold-plated proof last March.

In the role first incarnated by alleged kleptomaniac and drug addict Wynyna Rydyr,  Christina Ricci almost ""steals the show"" while seemingly operating under massive doses of narcotics.  The scene where she almost starts to get upset about something will haunt this viewer for some time to come.  Likewise, the troll-like make-up effects created for Ricci's character are almost as stunning as the transformations wrought upon Theron, and should certainly have garnered Academy attention.

Though most of the original ""Beetlejuice"" plot points have either been jettisoned or so transformed as to be unrecognizable, its ""exorcising living people from houses"" angle is neatly transposed to ""exorcising living johns from their cars, and then stealing the cars"".

(Irony of ironies: the ""Monster"" of the title refers not to Aileen Wournos, but to an entirely SEPARATE fearsome, ramshackle amusement ride.)",1127001600,,1288,5.41
1518392,4,B00005JMUK,"As advertised (and Academy-awarded) this movie contains a brilliant, startling and sensational performance by Charlize Theron as the true-life prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Theron is over the top yet at the same time so totally controlled that her character is beautifully--if horrifically--realized.  Opening as a much-abused street hooker who is treated like trash by almost everybody, Theron morphs ""Lee"" into a swaggering, macho murderess in a manner sure to chill many viewers straight to the bone.  Yet all the while Theron conveys the vulnerability of a tragically twisted person who was never loved, only beaten, raped and tossed aside.  The sordidness of her life and the hopelessness of her future are indelibly etched upon our memory.

Much of the credit for this once in a lifetime performance must go to director Patty Jenkins who also wrote the script, which is itself quite a sensation.  Jenkins books no compromise with propriety or with the audience's sensitivities.  She rubs our face in Aileen's dehumanized life as a street hooker picked up by strangers who treat her like filth and abuse her in ways that are unspeakable.  Central to the irony of the film is the fact that her life is that of a likely serial killer victim herself, since women who ply their trade in such a way are most vulnerable to sadistic attacks.  But ""Lee,"" inspired by her passionate and first-in-a-lifetime love for Selby, her mousy lesbian girl friend, played with sly and sneaky sparkle by Christina Ricci, turns the tables on the sickies who pick her up and finds a measure of short-lived empowerment by blowing the johns away with a large revolver.

Jenkins uses quick and deft strokes to establish who and what Aileen is, and just as deftly establishes Selby as the church-going wallflower at the local same-sex bar.  Jenkins's technique thrusts the viewer headlong into the story as Aileen drags herself out of the rain and into the bar to meet Selby who immediately latches onto her.  Quickly they become friends, and then in a compelling and entirely convincing scene, fall in love while roller skating.  This is followed by a steamy alley engagement in which both ""Lee"" and Selby discover their wild passion for one another.  Both scenes are among the best of their type that I have ever seen.

Although Theron got the major share of the glory for the success of this movie, and Jenkins most of the credit, Ricci was not far behind.  Her character too is etched in my mind.  How wonderfully cast were the two, the one physical and manlike, the other weak, naive and femme.  And how lifelike the chemistry and how tragic the conjoining.

Yes, this is an American tragedy thurbo'ed up for sensation-seeking audiences, presented with relentless views of violence and sensuality, featuring humanity at its most debased.  So over-the-top were some of the scenes that I found myself unaccountably laughing in surprise at the sheer hutzpa of Jenkins's savage treatment.

Be forewarned that this movie leaves little to the imagination, and when it does, it makes sure you know exactly what depravity you are to imagine.  As such I would not recommend that anyone with delicate sensibilities view it.  It is a study of the character of two women who find first love and first real passion together, but it is so thoroughly laced with violence and depravity that for many that love will become nothing more than ignoble animal lust.

See this for both Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, two of cinema's most gifted young actresses.",1126137600,4,3540,4.961016949152542

1518394,5,B00005JMUK,"While IMHO ""Monster"" is an absolutely amazing film, it obviously is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But the only reasons for criticism are writer/director Patty Jenkins' exploitation of a real-life situation and the perception that serial killer Aileen is portrayed as more of a victim that those she murdered. While there is some logic to those arguments, I think Jenkins actually showed considerable restraint. Exploitation and character identification are inevitable in this type of story. It is more a question of degree-if you compare this to 1990's tearjerker ""Too Young to Die"" (starring Juliette Lewis in an almost identical story), Jenkins comes off as a model of objectivity and distanced perspective.

What is most unique and compelling about ""Monster"" is that it is much more a love story than a thriller or a crime drama. The two main love scenes are absolutely riveting, with intensity levels higher than you are likely to find in any other film. ""Tide Is High"" and ""Crimson and Clover"" will never sound the same.

One thing that works unexpectedly well is the incredible contrast between the two characters. Jenkins works hard to emphasize this, with camera shots that emphasize the physical size differences coupled with dialogue and behaviors that emphasize the contrasting personalities of this odd pair. Having Scott Wilson play the last murder victim is a homage to an earlier ""Mutt and Jeff"" pair of murderers, as he played Robert Blake's ""In Cold Blood"" sidekick.

Although most of the critical acclaim has gone to Theron for her portrayal of Aileen, I think that a lot of the credit for Theron's masterful performance should go to Ricci's subtle and nuanced portrayal of Selby. Watch Ricci's eyes in all her reaction shots, it is as close to acting for the camera perfection as you are likely to ever see.

If you really enjoyed Theron's incredible transformation from her typical hot starlet to this gritty prostitute role, then check out Catherine Deneuve in ""Repulsion"" (1965) and ""Belle de jour"" (1967). While not as physically extreme as Theron's transformation, Deneuve's two characters are equally hard to reconcile as being played by the same actress. Yet another acting for the camera marvel, as wardrobe, makeup, and hair-styling combine with behaviors and speech to effect an amazing range between two characters played by the same actress.

1518395,3,B00005JMUK,"At the Last Resort Bar & Grill, they have a sign: Home of Cold Beer and Killer Women.  Such gross exploitation of the terrible deeds of Aileen Wuornos makes one queasy in the stomach.  Arrested in 1991 and executed in 2002, Aileen Wuornos was not the first female serial killer in the world, or the first woman executed for murder in the U.S., but she was the U.S.'s first female serial killer.  A highway prostitute who killed only men, she was a scary looking woman whose simmering rage was visible in photos of her staring dark brown eyes.

Monster was written and directed by Patty Jenkins, who says in the DVD featurette that she was just ""showing what she sees,"" and would let people make up their own minds.  But unlike an objective journalist armed only with the facts, Jenkins writes a fictionalized script with made-up characters and events.  Although Aileen killed around seven men, we see only four killings in the film.  In the film, people treat her with horrible cruelty, for example a job counselor who says she can only get factory work, but there is none, and a lawyer at a firm where Aileen goes seeking work as a secretary.  It seems unrealistic that everyone would have been so vicious to a woman seeking a job.  That said, Monster is still worth a viewing or two.

Charlize Theron worked hard to play the killer Wuornos.  Her performance is like watching the real thing.  Every muscle in her face, every minute expression, conveys more than words ever could (which is good, considering the weakness of the script).  In the film, the Monster has a lot of humanity.  It has just gone unrecognized, which is incredibly tragic and moving.  Christina Ricci plays her girlfriend, Selby.  Bruce Dern plays a Vietnam vet who is Aileen's only friend.  He gives a great performance. I love me some Bruce Dern!

The score by BT is perfect- but never played!  Most of the movie plays with no music!  And when there is music, it is barely audible over the speaking.  Memorable shots and lines I can count on one hand.  The most striking photography shows Wuornos resting under an overpass, as cars pass by.  I would have used these shots a lot more.  Monster is really more like a made for TV/Lifetime movie than a large film production.

Monster ends strongly.  The last phone call between Wuornos and her girlfriend was very well done and had the most emotional impact of any scene in the film. At the end of the movie, I cried despite saying I would never cry for this murderer.  But I cried for this wasted life, this abandoned soul, and for other abandoned souls out there, looking for survival and for love.",1124236800,3,2622,4.606911447084233
1518396,5,B00005JMUK,"Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci star in this graphic and true story about Aileen Wuornos, an abused prostitute who was convicted of killing at least seven men in Florida.

Theron stars as Wuornos, while Ricci stars as Selby, a young and extremely naive girl who becomes involved, both romantically and eventually on the run with Aileen.  Aileen met Selby in the midst of her spree, and after spending time with her, she begins to fall in love.  Due to these feelings she's developed, she longs to have a real life and a real relationship with Selby.  However, she can't stop the killing.  She kills for revenge for the years of abuse she suffered, and she also kills for money for herself and Selby to survive.  Most of her victims were married men.  Aileen tries to get a ""real"" job, but no one will hire her due to her lack of skills.  As her life continues to crumble, even Selby begins to question her.

Eventually, Selby finds out what is really going on with Aileen, and she cooperates with the authorities to convict Aileen of multiple murder.  After being convicted and sentenced to die, Aileen Wuornos survived for twelve years on Death Row before finally being executed in October of 2002.  Aileen and Selby never spoke to each other after Aileen's trial.

This is a very good movie.  Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos won her an Academy Award for best actress.

1518399,5,B00005JMUK,"Charlize Theron burst on the movie scene in the usual ""starlet"" fashion, sexing up the big screen in such movies as ""Two Days in the Valley"" and ""The Devil's Advocate.""  Her sex appeal was undeniable, and for those who had the patience to look closer at those lightweight films, her acting was generally good.

What a difference a role can make!!!!  Theron virtually disappears into her role as Aileen Wuorno, ""America's First Female Serial Killer,"" in Patty Jenkins' ""Monster.""  While much has been made of the superficial aspects of the role (such as Theron's much-publicized weight gain and harsh, gritty make-up), Theron mastered the more difficult job of embodying the mannerisms and expressions of a woman who never really had a shot at life.  A grim demeanor that occasionally melts into pure happiness, self-conscious arm gestures and hair adjustments that occasionally morph into unconscious pleasure, and a stance that goes from awkward confusion to empowered confidence -- Theron has all these down cold, so much so that you're not even aware of an actress being on screen -- you're watching Aileen Wuorno.

Aileen Wuorno, according to the film, was a cipher, a nobody condemned to a life of prostitution by circumstance and indifference.  A lesser movie would have found excuses for her nefarious deeds, and while ""Monster"" shows that there may have been some rationale behind Aileen's killings, there is no justification.

Aileen is down to her last $5 and is making her peace with God when she runs into Selby (Christina Ricci, in a wonderful performance), a naive young gal exiled to relatives in Daytona Beach by her Iowa family so she can be ""cured"" over her lesbianism.  These two desperate souls soon develop a tight bond, and we get the sense that the romantic ""couples-skate"" at the roller rink is the first moment of pure peace and joy these two have experienced in quite some time.  Watch Theron's furious, hostile face melt as she sees something in Sel's eyes that she never expected -- acceptance.

With no skills but with a reproductive system, Aileen has turned to life as a highway prostitute.  Her first murder is pure self-defense, but as we watch her pump extra bullets into the dead body of her attacker, we see the vast reserve of rage that has been built up inside this poor woman.  Aileen learns that murder can be more profitable that prostitution, and she rationalizes her early killings with the idea that the men she's killing are scum of the earth . . . an idea that the movie (correctly) refuses to sustain.

Sel doesn't challenge Aileen, and is generally content to be kept by her new friend.  Watching Ms. Ricci inhabit this weak, lost character is a wonder, for after watching her in assertive, intelligent roles (""The Addams Family,"" ""The Opposite of Sex"") one could not imagine her a little cork bobbing along in someone else's wake.

Eventually the murders catch up with the duo, and it is worth noting that Aileen's victims become less than less ""deserving"" of their fate (indeed, the last ""john"" she kills isn't a john at all, but a good samaritan at the wrong place at the wrong time).  But by this time, Aileen's horrorific life has scarred her beyond redemption, and a helping hand must be chopped off before it can touch her.

Aileen's fate is a foregone conclusion - we all know how things turn out.  The power of ""Monster"" comes in the telling -- we may shed a tear at the end of ""Monster,"" but it's not because we know that a good woman is going to die.  It's because we have been reminded that there are people in this world whose lot in life is so pathetic that their Holy Grail is merely to live a hum-drum, normal life, and there is no chance in hell for that to ever happen.

A solid movie from start to finish that is dominated by stellar acting (even the supporting actors are excellent), ""Monster"" is a must-see.  Put it in the category of movies like ""The Passion of the Christ,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Platoon,"" and ""The Accused"" -- these aren't the kinds of movies that you're going to pop into the DVD player every Friday night.

I wonder if she will ever be able to top this performance.  That in itself makes this a definite DVD to add to your collection just as a reference for future Charlize projects.",1118620800,2,1263,4.555555555555555
1518443,5,B00005JMUK,"Monster is based on the true story of female serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a common prostitute that left a string of dead Johns in her wake.  Aileen (Lee) is on the verge of taking her own life when she meets up with Selby, a lesbian who is looking for companionship.  Selby gets Lee to talk, and they agree to meet again the next night.  Lee needs money, so she takes to the streets to make some cash.

Her last John brutally beats and rapes her, and in an act of (what seemed to be) self-defense, Lee shoots him to save her own life.  Selby and Lee hit it off and decide to set up house together, each having their own ideal of what 'a real life' should entail.  While Lee believes that giving up hooking and finding a real job is the key to her new life, Selby is too dependent to go out and get herself a job, therefore remaining reliant on Lee's income as a prostitute.  Life does not stay peachy for the new lovers, and after many heart-breaking rejections from the job market, Lee returns to hooking in order to feed her and Selby.

Whether Lee had simply had enough of prostitution, or whether the last brutal John soured her, or simply the idea that she had gotten away with it once, Lee adds a new twist to her hooking schema; murder.

Monster is not a fast paced story of the police investigation hurdling towards finding a killer, but the horrifically commonplace lives of two women who want more out of life but can't seem to find their way out of the trenches.  It didn't strike me as 'what would you do for love' type of story either, simply a deviant's twisted mentality of right and wrong.  It is a story of the human inside the animal, even a human as alien as Lee was, and the presentation those animals will make to remain human as long as they can.

Get ready to see the performance of a lifetime from previously uncelebrated actress Charlize Theron.  She *should* have won the award for her amazing performance in Monster, never again will you see her as a 'blah' or 'so-so' actress.  She immersed herself so deeply into the role that she became almost unrecognizable as the Charlize you have seen before.  The talk, the walk, the mannerisms, are all portrayed with a natural flow, you simply will not believe how good she is in this movie.

Special mentions go out to Christina Ricci (Selby) and Bruce Dern (Thomas) for their stellar performances also.  Director Patty Jenkins receives a tip from my hat also, for finding the human inside Aileen Wuornos and bringing it to the screen.  In the featurette, Patty mentions that Lee's behavior wasn't about strength or weakness, but about damage, and she managed to highlight this in the film.

I'm not usually a big fan of Special Features, but you absolutely MUST watch the featurette, where it shows the work behind the scenes and how they transformed Charlize Theron into Aileen Wuornos.  It's not just seeing the make up applied, but watching her mannerisms change as she imbeds herself into the role.

Monster is a superb movie, an emotional killer, which will leave you full of both pity and rage at what becomes of those who society turns their polite cheek away from.  I highly recommend Monster as a 'buy' rather than 'rent' DVD.  Enjoy!",1116806400,18,3216,4.525951557093426
1518444,4,B00005JMUK,"""Monster"" is just one of those films where you want to pull for the villain(or perhaps, victim?) but you know that deep inside she is wrong.  ""Monster"" tells with vivid detail the story of Aileen Wuornos(Theron), a prostitute who has basically been held down her entire life.  Abused sexually, physically and emotionally by her family, Wuornos grows up on the streets as a prostitute.  Eventually she finds true love in the arms of Selby(Ricci), a young outcast who she runs away with.

While trying to become honest, Wuornos runs into wall after wall for the simple fact that all she has ever known is prostitution and hate.  She is turned down for jobs due to the lack of experience.  She's even turned away by the unemployment office.  In short, she is kicked hard while she's down.  Returning to hooking, she has a violent experience that ends with the death of a ""John.""  Perhaps he deserved it, that's what you'll probably think when you see the film, but this is only the beginning of a violent string of murders that Wuornos will commit.  Though she does show mercy to one man in the film, she eventually becomes nothing but another cold-blooded murderer who is tailed by the cops.  She runs again, along with Selby, and the rest is history.

This is a very disturbing film.  It is openly honest and, as stated before, you will long to cheer for Wuornos, but in the end, she is ultimately a lost soul with no real light at the end of her tunnel.

Theron shines as Wuornos, almost unrecognizable under make-up and her own physical alterations.  Ricci does a good job as well, making me want to hate her for the selfish things she does to Wuornos.  The rest of the cast does well, but the focus here is placed obviously on Theron.

Check this one out, it is definitely a must-see.",1116460800,2,1786,4.566037735849057
1518445,4,B00005JMUK,"Gritty tragic tale about the exploits of a female serial killer. The title of the movie is slightly ironic since this movie fills out the flesh and bones of what we have read in the papers and succeeds in granting her humanity. The performance of Charlise Theron as Aileen Wuornos is every bit as good as you have been lead to believe. Theron does not simply manage to look like Wuornos, with her big boned gangly stride and psychotic rage filled eyes (when she is angry) she also does a good job of describing her inner workings, her peculiar vulnerability and pain. We see Wuornos the prostitute, homeless friendless and aimless, then when she finally meets someone who actually seems interested in her friendship (a newly outed lesbian girl well played by Christina Ricci) she finally has something to lose. One night she is nearly raped and murdered by a sadistic 'customer', she just manages to get the upper hand and kills him. The film explains that from this point on she is finished with prostitution, yet she must still eat and her new young lover demands to be fed so she meets would be 'Johns' and sets about unleashing her long pent up rage upon them, one after another she kills them and steals their car and money. We get the impression that she is insane, unable to differentiate anymore between the violent attacker and the other johns, she lumps them all together and only once is she merciful in an encounter with a john, in all other cases they die regardless. When a customer calls himself 'daddy' during one such encounter she rounds on him, accusing him of paedophilia. Is she fully aware of what she is doing and cynically manipulating herself to believe they deserve to die in order for her to be able to justify their murders to herself? Or is she hopelessly insane? As the film nears the sad inevitable conclusion we see her killing (in coldest blood) a concerned kind man who only wanted to help her. It is to the credit of this film that the director doesnt make any moral judgements about Aileen Wuornos, we are allowed to feel sorry about the murders of (most) of her victims and yet we cannot help but to feel sympathy for Wuornos herself, the pain of living such a sad dissapointing life would be difficult for anyone to bear and stay sane.

I have also viewed the documentary 'portrait of a serial killer' about Aileen Wuornos in prison, and a lawyers attempt to stop her from becoming another victim of the Bush familly. After viewing the interview with her it is plain to see that she is clearly stark raving mad, it would be impossible to fake such a display. It was cruel to incarcerate her without the medication she needed, even less humane to execute her in that condition, but good politics yes.",1115856000,,2737,4.597137014314929
1518446,5,B00005JMUK,"This movie is not for everyone. It's hard to take & depressing. It's the story of a lost, tortured soul who was certainly ""walking wounded"". She was a serial killer & by all accounts only the first killing was justified & the lowlife deserved his fate. The film tells the story of Aileen (Lee) Wuornos without justifying what she did. The viewer actually gets to know her as a human being & I sympathized with her to a degree. It's the humanization of her that made me sympathize with her. Otherwise, she'd just be another nut-job/hooker/murderer who also got what she deserved. There are some insights into her here & there in the film (molested as a child, raped by a family ""friend"", beaten by her father who later committed suicide, discarded by her siblings, became a prostitute at 13 to survive, battered by partners & cops, alcoholism etc.) that make you feel that this somewhat powerless & uneducated woman actually became addicted to killing once she started because it was a release of anger & hatred that had built up inside of her for so many years. I also felt sympathy for her because she wanted to ""go straight"" & work but she set her sights too high & was knocked down once again. Granted, the attempt to straighten her life out was mostly out of fear of being caught after she killed the first guy in self defense, but she also loved Selby & possibly wanted more ""nomalcy"" for them as a couple in that respect as well. I know the movie takes liberties with some facts. For example, the real Selby was not a whiny, naive nineteen year old, but a big bruiser who enjoyed instigating & egging Wuornos on into fights with others. Charlize Theron deserved her Oscar for portraying & transforming herself into this complex woman with so much passion & dedication.",1113696000,,1774,4.599369085173501
1518447,4,B00005JMUK,"""Monster"" is the heartwarming story of one Aileen Wuornos, a rough and tumble gal who killed a bunch of guys in Florida back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Eventually the cops got wise to the fact that the person bumping these chaps off was probably one of the numerous harridans roaming the highways and byways looking for johns. The authorities eventually hauled in Wuornos and got a confession, tried her for capital murder, and executed her about three years ago. End of story. Well, not according to writer/director Patty Jenkins. She thought Wuornos's tale of woe would make for a great movie, and thus ""Monster"" arrived on the scene last year to great acclaim. Thanks in large part to the shocking metamorphosis of lead actress Charlize Theron, the movie grabbed a lot of attention in all corners. Moreover, the film is notable because someone in Hollywood managed to make a film about a social outcast that didn't cover the subject with retch-inducing sycophancy. There aren't any heroes in ""Monster,"" and while the picture tries to garner some sympathy for the despicable Wuornos, it never attempts to justify the horrible actions committed by this loathsome serial killer--at least not that much, anyway.

One look at Aileen Wuornos ought to make any sane person head for the hills, but surprisingly many different types of guys pick her up on the side of the road. This works well for the woman since her appearance and rough manner virtually ensures that she can't find adequate employment anywhere else, at least not the sort of work that she could use to support herself. Indeed, one part of the film documents Wuornos's attempts to leave her ugly past behind in order to find a decent job only to find rejection awaits her at every stop. Anyway, her life suddenly takes on new meaning thanks to two major events. First, she meets a young woman with serious personal issues, Selby Wall (Christina Ricci), in a bar and the two strike up an odd relationship. Wuornos is just what this young girl is looking for, primarily an escape from the fundamentalist relatives her father sent her to after exhibiting questionable behavior up in Ohio. Second, Wuornos kills a john after the guy nearly kills her on an abandoned road. Needing to move on for a time to avoid potential problems with the police, Aileen eventually convinces Selby to tag along.

The two move through a string of scuzzy hotels and run down shacks before settling in a fairly nice house. But there are problems, mainly Selby's need to meet people outside the relationship and her ever so subtle manipulations of Wuornos's frail ego. Afraid of losing Selby and with her absence the only sense of love she's ever felt in her life, Wuornos not only continues but also escalates her vicious rampages. She starts offing any of the patrons who pick her up even when it is clearly obvious they have no intention of physically harming her. Wuornos then sells off the men's cars for the cash needed to keep her girlfriend satisfied. It's really a sick relationship made even worse by the fact that Selby knows what's going on and refuses to put a stop to it. Oh, she goes through the motions, crying and screaming and asking her beloved ""Lee"" what is going on, but she always comes back for more. And why not? Every so often Wuornos shows up with a wad of cash and takes care of everything. That Selby will eventually turn on her lover when the cops come a knockin' should be a foregone conclusion.

While I don't fully agree with others who have said that ""Monster"" overly sympathizes with its subject, there is evidence of such objectionable behavior in the script. We don't know what Aileen Wuornos really said or did when she killed her victims, so presenting her as crying and remorseful even as she drops the hammer on a victim is a bit of a stretch--especially when it's more than obvious that by this point she is killing solely to make money. But getting something out of the film doesn't really rely on agreeing or disagreeing with how Jenkins depicts her subject as much as it does on the amazing performance turned in by Charlize Theron. An incredibly beautiful woman by any standard, the actress undergoes an incredible transformation to play the pasty faced, obese Aileen Wuornos. She's got everything down, from the woman's voice to her posture and body language. If you don't believe such a thing possible, try and find a documentary or crime show on the real Wuornos and then watch the movie. It's quite remarkable, actually, and very disturbing as well. The only time I could tell I was looking at Theron occurred when she smiled, but other than that we might as well be staring into the late Aileen Wuornos's mug. Scary.

The DVD comes with a few extras, primarily a couple of short featurettes explaining how Jenkins and Theron conducted research into the character and one outlining how the film score came about. No commentary track, surprisingly, but that will probably arrive when someone releases the collector's edition, super duper special feature two disc compilation delivered to your home by Theron herself wearing her Wuornos get up. I heartily recommend ""Monster,"" and would watch it again if given the chance. It reeks of nihilism, contains some of the finest acting I've seen this year, and deals with subject matter most filmgoers avoid like the plague.",1113523200,,5360,4.7976190476190474
1518448,5,B00005JMUK,"I can't help but say Charlize's effort alone at portraying America's female serial killer Aileen Wuarnos, is worth the five stars. But the movie was sad to me. You can't help but feel sympathy for alieen in the film and real life. By the way, they wrote the movie way before Aileen's confessions that she made up the stories about her being raped and attacked, and they had already wrote it into the movie. Also, a while ago I was at a hotel and there was nothing on except a documentary about Aileen, and I watched it and I couldn't help but feel sympatthy for her. It's very easy to say she deserved to be executed, for her cold blooded murders. Towards the end, the interviews showed her paranoid delusions, and she believed they put camaras in her cell, and she kept saying ""it's all a conspiracy, they are now controlling my brain waves and making me ill."" Those are ramblings of a skitsophrenic. Lets not forget her police conspiracy theory. How they made her a killer by not catching her even when she had a record and left her fingerprints everywhere. And her detailed self defense story raises serious question about her mental health. Like how he put alcohol on her after he raped her. It was all lies. She clearly had a mental illness that was probably not overlooked but rather ignored. And at the end of the documentary, they played this song that she wanted played at her wake, by natalie merchant. I forget the title but it went ""I walked these streets in a spectacle of wealth and poverty.."" I don't think it's wrong to feel sympathy for sick people, and she did do a terrible thing, and I'm not sure if executing a mentally insane person was the solution which is also what the interviewer said after they excuted her in 2002 i think it was. She also said that when the ""rock hits us in the future"" she will be riding on the rock in a space ship or something weird along those lines. Obviously, that is not a stable person talking, and her laugh was high pitched like a witch. No doubt about giving me the creeps, but if you heard her life growing up, her mom abandoned her, she was sleeping on the streets, having to have sex for money to buy food. It's not an excuse, but how we grow up, shapes our adult characters teremendously. I am not condoning turning to homicide just because you had a hard life. Alot of us have had tough times. But even her mother said she suffered brain damage when she was born, when she was giving birth to her, she went without oxygyn for too long. Next, her lover betrayed her, which of course is the right thing (turning her in). But all her life, no one loved her it seems. Every person she trusted either betrayed her or abandoned her. We don't even know if Alieen felt remorse or not for killing those men. In the film, aileen cried before shooting that guy who begged for his life and pleeded to her how he had children and a wife. I just think she was mentally disturbed and couldn't help it. Even good people turn bad. You'd have to know your psychology to understand, and she even had a relationship with selby and took care of her girl, so if she was able to love her, she isn't completely cold blooded and heartless. People can kill and feel remorse. I just think it's a chemical imbalance or brain damage. There's a difference between killing and enjoying it, and killing on impulse and being unable to control yourself. There are so many mental illnesses we cant even begin to understand unless you have one of those diseases. Like skitsophrenia. Paranoid delusions, where you think everyone's after you, when it's not the case at all. I think if this movie focused more on her early years that led up to when she met selby and started killing, maybe it would help with understanding the circumstances that led up to her murders.",1113091200,2,3791,4.448275862068965

She is the product of years of hammering on the soul-destroying anvil of street-life and selling her body for money. Moments away from commiting suicide, Aileen meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) in a bar and sparks fly, leading this hopeless woman to believe she might actually find happiness. Aileen attempts to run off with Selby and save her from her hyper-religious family.

1518534,3,B00005JMUK,"Hollywood and its baby brother on the indy front have decided they don't want to make movies that mean anything anymore. They have decided, like an overbearingly pompous mother, just what is good for us. Gone are the days of films like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Apostle, The Shawshank Redemption and other films that changed our movie habits forever. They do, however, have a newfound liking for films that empathize with characters caught in a nigthmarish hell and that seize our emotions and shatter them like glass. I'm sorry if I sound the part of a simpleton here, but nihilism is getting tiresome.

In Monster, the empathy for a woman who, although having things done to her so heinous that I felt sick at the thought of the miscreants who hurt her, still seems to scream at us - in the films theme, that is - that it's not really her fault that she now kills people. It was the fault of the rapist who molested her at age of eight. It was the fault of the man who rapes her when she starts ""hooking."" It was the fault of society. It wasn't her fault when she takes an innocent man out to a field and shoots in in the back of the head.

I hated when the film started to twist its ugly, but nowadays predictably thematic head. Another gem of a ""thinking"" film was at it again, bringing forth all its pretention and presumption along with it. The message, escorted handsomely by numerous awards for Therin and the film, told us, ""If you village dwellers don't grasp our statement here, you probably adore films like  The Wedding Planner and Racing Stripes.""

WRONG!

I got the theme and I almost puked all over myself. I can empathize with a woman who's been pained by a terrible childhood and life - both of my parents have lived through nightmarish hells as children and grown into people who love others without condition - but I will not empathize with that woman when she decides to keep the cycle of hell going by taking life.

I would have liked to have watched a film about the family of the innocent man who is killed in the field. I would have enjoyed that very much, being that it would be an honest balance. But alas, you will never see that. Curse these film gurus for dishing it out so one-sidedly.

I assume many of you will dismiss my opinion but for those of you who have doubts, save yourself from washing off the vomit and the unwanted influx of tears from your already tattered movie shirt.",1109980800,8,2425,4.423766816143497
1518535,5,B00005JMUK,"We all know that Charlize Theron is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in Hollywood today. But for her role in the 2003 film, Monster, no one had expected see this beautiful girl take on a role so horrifying. That role is the real life role of serial killer & prostitute, Aileen Wuornos.

  Aileen Wuornos (played the beautiful Charlize Theron) has grown up living the worst life you could even possible think of. She was raped and beaten. You would think she would have at least one day to be happy during her adolescent years. But Aileen had one day killed the man who she was living with the time for raping her and beating her.

  No grown up and living Florida, Aileen has no professional job. Instead, she earns living as a prostitute. Living with her is Selby (played by Christina Ricci), who has made abundantly clear that is a full-blown out Lesbian. Together, Aileen and Selby have developed a friendship, which goes into a sort of love affair. Because of her rotten teen years, Aileen is all screwed up. I mean, she is experiment with lesbianism, she is prostituting all over Florida. Now, she lures men into thinking she'll give them a quick bang in the backseat of their cars. Apparently, the men do get a quick bang in the backseat, but the bang is not even close to sex; the quick bang is a gunshot, coming from the gun owned by Aileen. Seven murders later, Aileen is arrested and taken to court, after she allows Selby to go free, since she has nothing to do with the murders. Aileen was locked up, sentenced for life, where she and Selby never spoke again. On October 29th, 2002, Aileen was executed after a 12-year trial.

  For this role, Charlize Theron's beauty had vanished into the hideous face of Aileen Wuornos. Because of her outstanding portrayal as the psychotic woman, Charlize had received the Oscar for Best Actress. And I tell you something, this woman more than deserved the award. Aileen may have been a complete wacko, meaning she lied about the whole ordeal she went through, while growing up, Charlize had portrayed this character so brilliantly that there was no choice, but to allow Charlize to be the only actress to win this Oscar award.

I now know how people feel when they tell me they have to close the book from time to time because of the scenes I've written.

Patty Jenkins wrote and directed Monster, which is a powerful depiction of a woman who had been brutalized for years, and ended up becoming a murderess. Charlize Theron won the Oscar for her surreal protrayl of Aileen, who only needed to be loved. This seems to be a recurring theme in our society. The monsters of the world create more monsters as the brutalized mind twists and then turns the tables on their captors.

Aileen Wuornos was finally executed in 2002, after spending many years on death row.

The film details the hard knocks life led by Aileen Wuornos, from that of a troubled teenager looking for love in all the wrong places to that of a hard living prostitute. It also looks at the very human side of Aileen Wuornos, a woman who found love in the person of a troubled, young lesbian in her late teens (Christina Ricci), who would ultimately betray the trust that Aileen Wuornos believed lay between her and her eventual fate.

Ms. Theron's physical transformation is startling, though I found her still recognizable as Charlize Theron. It is her performance, however, rather than her physical transformation,  that is more startling, as she infuses it with a high voltage intensity and swagger that bowls the viewer over. She makes the person of Aileen Wuornos come to life. She is a low rent individual,  white trash to the core, prostituting herself by getting into cars in order to have sex with total strangers. So, this film is not for the fastidious, as we are looking at the seamy underbelly of the beast in this film, and it sure isn't pretty. It is also a credit to Ms. Theron's compelling performance that the viewer is able to feel pity for Aileen Wuornos, a woman who is so vile, yet, at the same time, so vulnerable and pathetic.

The direction is excellent in the film, as are all the supporting performances. Christina Ricci is very good as the weak, passive,  troubled young woman with whom Aileen Wuornos enters into a lesbian love affair, a relationship which lasted years in real life rather than the short time depicted in the film. Ms. Ricci infuses the role with a certain amoral, vapid selfishness that makes the character's betrayal of Aileen Wuornos comprehensible. Bruce Dern, in the role of Thomas,  Aileen Wuornos' only true friend, is a stand out, as he adds depth to an otherwise small role. It is clear that Thomas saw something in Aileen Wuornos that the rest of the world missed. It is the most decent relationship that Aileen Wuornos appears to have had.

The film itself, despite the stellar performances, is somewhat flawed,  as it is unclear as to what made Aileen Wuornos tick, though it makes an  attempt at deciphering her psyche. There are several theories that are exposed for the viewer to ponder: abused child, rape victim, and love sick puppet. They fall short of explaining adequately this  troubled woman who would go on to achieve such notoriety. Notwithstanding this unresolved issue, the film is still a compelling one, though not one I would necessarily care to view again, as there is nothing at all uplifting about the disturbing and sordid life led by Aileen Wuornos. Consequently, I consider this film to be a one shot deal, despite the wonderful performances.",1106524800,3,3112,4.875

I found it to be just plain average...I was pretty excited to see this film but ended up dissapointed.  Theron did a great job but lets admit here, great acting...but Not a GREAT film.  Christina did a fine job too I must say.  I'll make this short and sweet for you, Good acting, Yeah it's based on a true story but it could have bin more convincing, some parts were NOT needed and I won't bring up those parts...and if they were..well...Sue me for saying that.

I thought it was just an average film, really I did, But I'll say it again this had some superb acting but just a really average film..which is based on a true story...

1518554,5,B00005JMUK,"I didn't watch this at the cinema. I watched it on DVD at home. I have to admit this movie was so strong I couldn't watch it at one go. I had to watch it a few scenes at a time. Now, with regards to gore and explicit nude and sex scenes, this movie is not over-the-top. In fact I'm impressed why a lot of people with negative reviews have been scandalized by the movie's sexual scenes. The most you see is Charlize's [...] and I think we should be used to seeing this type of flesh exposure on cinema and TV. Maybe it's the lesbic content of the sexual scenes that some people just can't digest. But, for me, that's just turning one's eyes away from an accepted reality nowadays. However, despite all this, this movie is still very strong.

Reading other reviews, I noticed that some people were angry at the movie for trying to justify murderers while other were angry at the movie for putting homosexuality in a bad light. This shows that ultimately the movie does not bias itself towards one perspective rather than another but it actually gives an objective picture of the story, leaving the viewers a space for their personal interpretation. Personally, I never thought the movie was trying to justify anything. Based (with an emphasis on the word BASED) on the true story of Aileen, of whom I made a bit of research on the internet, the movie highlights both the difficult childhood and youth of the serial killer and what she became in her adulthood. The movie doesn't try to justify Aileen at all. In fact, in one scene of the movie, there's a conversation between Selby and her aunt in which Selby sympathizes with her terrible past while her aunt says that not all people with a difficult childhood become hookers. The way Aileen's futile attempts to escape what she has become are depicted is done in a very effective manner. And finally, in the scene were Aileen and Selby are talking over the phone while the conversation is being taped, I couldn't not break into a waterfall of tears. The scene was so heartbreaking! I couldn't not feel for a character who lived like a stray dog, throughout her whole life was treated like a stray dog and in the end had to die unloved, just like a stray dog!

Ultimately, the movie's aim is not that of depicting Aileen as a good person. It depicts Aileen as a weak and fragile person who, throughout her life, was punished for her own bad decisions. Despite all of this, not everyone is intrinsically bad, and we see that Aileen was still a person in need of love, and who was still able to deeply love Selby. In other words, we get a very 3-dimensional view of the serial killer's character.

A very good but strong movie. So beware of this, whoever watches it!",1105488000,4,2712,4.496957403651115
1518555,5,B00005JMUK,"If there was ever a more deserved academy award for a lead dramatic performance, Charlize Theron as serial killer, Aileen Wuormos, it most certainly is this one. Take away the latex, make-up and false teeth, the extra thirty pounds and damaged blond hair, and you would still have the unnerving personification of this tragic woman.

This dark tale, based on a true story, is disturbing on many levels. The character of Aileen Wuormos, on one level, is a terrible indictment of a compassionless society. A more accurate title for this film would be, ""The Making of a Serial Killer."" Aileen Wuormas was sexually abused as a young child by one of her father's best friends, and then beaten severely by her father for telling him. In effect, this little child was raped on a continual basis throughout puberty. Forced on the street at thirteen years of age, she turns to prostitution, and lives her life in this manner for the rest of her days. As the character states at one point in the film, no one knows what life is like as a homeless person and a prostitute, unless you are one, it is not an easy life, taking a tremendous amount of will to survive, but if it's the only thing you know to survive, you keep doing it.

In a seeming compassionless world, she meets a lonely young woman who reaches out to her. Selby (Christina Ricci) is a lovely enough girl, naive and inexperienced, but is weak, incapable of action, and utterly dependent. Though for the strong and independent Aileen, a perfect partner to care for and love. This is a complicated relationship, but in the end, a transparent one.

The turning point in the film, and for Aileen Wuormos, is the unmentionable incident, where she's beaten, made a prisoner, and horrifically raped. To save her life she retaliates as any person in the same situation would, killing her assailant. This sets her off onto a killing spree across Florida, assassinating Johns, found in compromising positions. When she finally confesses to Selby about the murders, her justification is,

""Everybody out there is killing and raping, and I'm the one out there killing them"".

There is no justifying murder in any situation, unless in self defence, or in the organised arena of war, but writer/director, Patty Jenkins, has endeavoured to reveal to us another side, and that is a victim living on raw hopes and dreams that are continually crushed, unleashing a response, an almost primeval reaction of extreme violence.

This is a film that I would have no desire to see again, though brilliant, once is enough, as it is such a tragedy.",1105401600,2,2576,4.76457399103139
1518556,4,B00005JMUK,"I love to drink while watching movies, but I was so transfixed while watching this movie, I barely drank at all, and had a dry mouth by the end of this movie. I'd be shocked if I blinked at all, while watching this.

I bought this, purely because it was in the sales, and it was on my wishlist. And I needed to spend some money. So I got this.

I'd never really heard of Aileen Wuornos before, apart from all the press coverage saying that Charlize Theron was going to play her. Now, I'm more curious about her whole story, and after watching the movie, I'm curious to find out what happened to Selby, apart from the fact they never spoke again. I'm curious to find out why these people like Aileen spend so much time on Death Row, and why they can't be exectuted straight away. To spend 12 years (and more, in the case of Kenny Ritchie) on Death Row, only to die in the end seems pointless.

As soon as Charlize appeared on screen as the hard, butch, Aileen, my mouth dropped open. I just could not believe it was the same girl. There's two shots in the movie where she appears topless, and in just her underwear, and it's amazing to see the physical transformation she's gone through just to play Aileen. Charlize, notorious in my eyes for being super skinny, has boobs & a booty, and cellulite. There is a God after all! She gained 30lbs for this movie, and although it's slightly too much, she looks better with a little bit more flesh. She's so tall (5ft 9 and a half - the half is always important), that she can carry it off well, whereas, Christina Ricci, who only gained 10lbs, looks plain dumpy. After a while, you stop comparing the Charlize on screen, to her normal self, and you get caught up in the story, and really begin to believe that it's Aileen - it's almost like her spirit possessed Charlize. Not many actresses can pull that off.

What was so noticable about Christina, apart from how utterly short she was next to Charlize (she's 5ft 1), was how young she looked. This was probably to make the difference between the two actresses as big as possible. And Christina's hair was dreadful! Absolutely dreadful! With only five years between the two actresses, it would have been difficult to make the beautiful actresses look as harsh as possible, to make a bigger comparison.

I loved this movie, I was warned beforehand that I would probably hate it, but I didn't. I was fascinated by the entire movie, and was shocked, and was nearly in tears by the end of the movie. It never excuses the murders, or attempts to make them any less cold-blooded murders than they already were. Also shown is that Lee (her full name is never given in the movie) does have compassion - she never killed the stuttering virgin. The film is shown to be very bleak & sparse, and none of it was in the slightest OTT. Just a grittier, more realistic version of Thelma & Louise.

Aileen's murder victims have been fictionlised to spare their families more grief & embarrassment. But they're still well-portrayed, especially the last John. You really felt for Aileen & him in the final moments.

If you're a rather sensitive soul, and cross yourself every time someone swears, then you should avoid this movie. Aileen drops the F-word (and other related words) a mere 189 times. But her coarse language is absolutely necessary to the character. You can't imagine Aileen every being brought up to speak politely.

This movie has definitely aroused my interest in Aileen, and I'm going on the hunt for her biography, which is no doubt out there somewhere. The movie & Charlize have to be seen to be believed, and afterwards, a lasting impression will be made on you. This is a movie that will never be forgotton.",1105056000,,3705,4.527653213751869
1518557,4,B00005JMUK,"I echo the other reviews here, giving Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci full salute for their stellar performances.  However, I thought I would write about the caveat I found in this movie.  That is Jenkins's overly-thorough scenes of Aileen and Shelby having sexual contact.

It's ironic that a film about a prostitute can contain unnecessary, tedious lesbian scenes, especially since the film was able to focus on the important motifs -- humiliation, survival, and exploitation -- during Aileen's experiences ""hooking"".  I fast forward through Aileen and Shelby's whoopee, to get back to the stellar performances and thought-provoking themes.  Honestly, the lesbian scenes are unpleasant, grotesque, and incongruous to the treatment of sex and sexuality in the rest of the film.  Orgasmic music, lighting effects, clever camera angles, groping, and nudity were not necessary in any of the other sexual sequences in this film.

Aileen's search for love and acceptance were brilliantly handled, but the fad-like showcase of exotic lesbian sex negatively impacts a lot of the excellence.",1104969600,,1088,5.479041916167665
1518558,5,B00005JMUK,"No one could predict Charlize Theron playing this role and winning an oscar no less.  Roger Ebert even went on record saying this was one of the best performances he had ever seen in film history. (Considering how many thousands of films critics see, that's saying ALOT).  I still can't believe it's her when I see the movie.  What an amazing transformation, up there with Nicole Kidman's in ""The Hours"".  Charlize's performance is so gut wrenching and sad it almost makes you  feel sorry for this woman you almost forget is a serial killer. You end up feeling so bad for her when she's out trying to turn her life around and go on job interviews, only to be scoffed at and denied,  (i'm sure we've all felt that rejection at some time in our lives).  I only wonder if Ailleen Wournos actually did try to find a way out. Rather than view this movie as a play by play real life crime drama, I was more impressed with the brilliant acting.  Christina Ricci also did a great acting job, she's always a trip.  I have no idea how Charlize channeled the aura and energy of her character but it is almost unreal to watch. A sad and ironic twist of fate that Miss Wuornos didn't get to see the movie about her crime spree life and an academy award won in her essence.",1104710400,,1259,4.346153846153846
1518559,4,B00005JMUK,"As you can tell by the 300 other reviews here, this version of the Aileen Wournos story doesn't tell the whole truth. If that's what you're looking for you need to view one of the many biographs on the serial killer.

If you want to see Charlize Theron's monster performance (and makeup) of this real life ""Monster"", this movie will do the job for you. With the help of some magnificent makeup artistry, pretty girl Theron transformed herself into a trailer trash hooker for this flick. She was well abetted by an equally strong performance by another pretty girl, Christina Ricci, who plays her best bud and lover.

If I was a state of Florida official I wouldn't be too happy with the way the Sunshine State is portrayed in this movie. It sure doesn't look like the place everyone east of the Mississippi River aspires to retire to!

But the main reason to rent or buy this is to see Theron's once in a lifetime performance. She probably equals the transformation Cliff Robertson made playing a mentally retarded man in the 1968 film ""Charly"", another tour de force that won an Oscar. People that think great actors are made and not born might want to think again after viewing this movie for Theron sure is a different animal that the one she played in previous movies.",1103587200,2,1272,4.594713656387666
1518560,5,B00005JMUK,"Aileen (Charlize Theron) has lived most of her life waiting to be discovered in a similar way to Marilyn Monroe, but this never happened. She ended up blowing guys for five bucks in the back seat of their cars, living out of a storage room, taking baths in the sinks of public restrooms and trying to survive. She has really nothing to cheer her up, until one day she walks into a gay bar and meets Selby (Christina Ricci). They quickly become friends and even more, but not before Aileen recanted some statements she made due to her being a compulsive liar.

When things go south with one of her clients, Aileen ends up killing the man after being brutally abused. From that point on we can see her rage towards her clients and her desire to ""punish"" them for being what they are. Or maybe she is angry with herself for having to do this job and takes it out on them. She does try to change paths though, mainly due to her love for Selby. She wants to take care of her partner's need, but finds no help whatsoever when looking for a job. So, back to the old work...and hello serial killer.

There are several things about this movie that make it brilliant, with Theron's performance right at the top of the list. For an actress that is usually involved in representing classy and beautiful women, it must be a real challenge to play the role of Aileen. Part of the credit has to go to the make-up artists though, who made possible an incredible transformation.

The other point that I think is worth mentioning is the quality of the script, since the story takes us inside the mind of the serial killer. It is fascinating to understand the motives and reasons behind her actions. I can understand though that people that have been touched by the effects of Wuornos' crimes are not interested in this and may resent it. Also, I am not sure about how much of what is presented is fiction. In my mind, even if part of the ""facts"" presented are fiction, this movie is a high quality creation and a very interesting option to consider the next time you plan to sit in front of the TV for a couple of hours.",1103500800,4,2102,4.384615384615385
1518621,5,B00005JMUK,"The movie is a sad and depressing look at the life of Aileen Wournos, one of the most notorious serial killers in American history.  As we see her slow desend into her murderous rampage, we also see what her life was.  Raped at the age of 8 by a family friend, forced into prostitution to make ends meet and then finally kill a john in self-defense.  We see that she had the chance to straighten up her life.  Unfortunately, she had no choice but to go back to the life she lived before because no one would give her the chance.

Never have I seen a better performance in the last 40 years.  Her performance is one for the ages, right up there with Marlon Brando, Bette Davis, and Katherine Hepburn.  Charlize Theron is an amazingly beautiful actress.  The transformation into the character in this movie is incredible.  She is barely recognizable!  In addition to Theron, Christina Ricci gives a great performance and has blossomed into a great actress.  Those who are not familiar of Wournos' life should look further by reading ""Lethal Intent"" by Sue Russell or her autobiography in print or the DVD documentary by Nick Bloomfield.  This movie is unforgetable!",1103414400,,1163,4.674876847290641
1518622,4,B00005JMUK,"...I just did a little research on Ms. Wuoronos after being amazed by the film.  When I saw the first killing, which in the movie, is spurred by a very violent rape, I thought that perhaps Ms. Wuoronos was executed wrongly.  However, it appears that she recanted the rape claim altogether (victim's real name was Richard Mallory).  That kinda ticks me off, because that is a key scene that made me feel sympathetic for this pathetic woman.  NOW I read that she recanted that story altogether!  With that in mind, this now comes off as a man-hating diatribe that you can watch with your girlfriends who have been wronged by men.

In any event, even if this major fact is wrong in the film, this really IS an amazing film.  Charlize, as you've heard, does a fantastic job of pulling off the trailer-trash personality of Ms. Wuoronos.  Christina Ricci does a great job, but I read that Aileen's friend in real life was 28, while the film made Ricci's character seem like 17 or 18 years old.

So, although I was glued to the TV, I am a little disappointed at the major factual flaws that I have unearthed since watching it.",1102291200,,1119,4.5
1518623,3,B00005JMUK,"I have read Lethal Intent and watched several biographies on Aileen Wuernos. This movie claims to be based on the ""True Story"", however, at best it is a loose adaptation of Ms. Wuerno's life. Aileen was involved with her lover long before the first murder occurred, and despite what the film portrays, we have only Aileen's words for what actually happened between killer and victims. Until her death, Ms. Wuernos maintained that all the murders were the result of self-defense. Christina Ricci, who plays the role of Aileen's lover, is perhaps most misaligned throughout the movie. Contrary to what the producers would have us believe, she was sporadically employed and contributed financially to the relationship. There are also a number of other inaccuracies, but, having said that, the film still moved me to tears. I can't say enough about Charlize Theron's ability to portray Aileen's desperate and fruitless search for love and belonging. She slipped into Aileen's character with an ease that is almost uncanny. For me the saddest part of yet another Aileen Wuernos movie is that so many people have profitted from the crimes and misfortune of this woman. I only hope that on some level we all realize that Aileen was also a victim.",1102204800,,1239,4.990338164251208
1518624,4,B00005JMUK,"This was one of the most gut-wrenching movies I've seen in quite a while. It takes the life of serial killer Aileen Wuornos, one of only ten women to be executed in the United States since the reinstatement of the death penalty, and actually makes us empathize with her. Wuornos's story is a tragic one, and when one looks at her history it becomes clear that she was doomed from the beginning. Repeatedly molested by a family friend as a child, she began prostituting herself by the age of thirteen. It was the only job she ever knew. The movie picks up with Aileen (Charlize Theron) as an adult, suicidally depressed, entering a gay bar. There she meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci), a similarly lonely and depressed, yet far more naive, lesbian teenager. The two, desperate for love and companionship, enter into an odd sort of relationship. But unfortunately, as Aileen quickly finds out, love is not enough.

At first Aileen and Selby build grand dreams of creating a new, ""normal"" life together. Aileen plans to clean up, stop hooking, and get a real job. But with no experience, no degree, and an abrasive personality that offers a glimpse at the deep-rooted and barely-restrained anger constantly seething inside her, she is turned down at every place she applies. Ultimately, she returns to hooking. The situation intensifies when, brutally raped and beaten, Aileen kills one of her customers with a handgun. From here on we see her pulled further and further into a tangled web of murders, each one embroiling her more and making it harder to contemplate turning back.

The progression of her murders makes an interesting study. (At least, the way they are shown here is fascinating. It is hard to know the exact circumstances of Aileen Wuornos's murders since she continually changed the details of her confession.) Her first victim clearly deserved what he got, and is a perfect example of what made Aileen hate men. But after this Aileen begins to see murder as a way of getting money and thereby supporting herself and Selby. With each successive killing we see Aileen's demeanor change. At first she still shows signs of having a heart and some human feeling. But by the third murder her manner is far more calculating and cold. Killing has become a business transaction. And by the time she kills her seventh and final victim, who wasn't even a customer but simply a kindly man trying to offer some help, we see that she has reached a point of no return.

Do the unfortunate circumstances surrounding Aileen Wuornos's life excuse her murders? Certainly not. But ""Monster"" manages to show a much more human side to her than most of the articles written about her case. We can, at least, understand WHY she ended up as she did. Abused and molested, she never knew the love that every child needs in order to grow into a healthy adult. She became pregnant in her early teens, was turned out of her home by the surviving members of her family (her father, in prison, had committed suicide, and many other family members were lost to drugs, illness, and other causes), and gave her child up for adoption. From then on she earned money the only way she knew how, by prostitution, and when she did try to find a better job, she was repeatedly turned down. If only ONE person had offered her any kind of chance at some sort of real job, then - though it's impossible to know for sure and one can only speculate - perhaps she would not have ultimately resorted to murder.

Aileen did manage to find love, after a fashion, with the aforementioned Selby Wall, but it was not the kind of love she needed in order to prevent her downward slide into murder and madness. Selby, in whom Aileen can see traces of her own younger self, has not seen much of the world. Though at odds with her own family, she has never known true hardship. She is naive and selfish. Though the relationship between Aileen and Selby has plenty of raw passion, it possesses none of the things that make a relationship really work. Selby is still a child, expecting Aileen to support and take care of her, and simply cannot make up for the love and nourishment that Aileen's childhood lacked.

Charlize Theron deserved every ounce of her Academy Award as Best Actress for this movie. She did not just portray Aileen Wuornos - she WAS Aileen Wuornos. The physical transformation alone is incredible, makeup making the usually stunning Theron nearly unrecognizable, but her actual performance is above and beyond. The speech, the swagger, every little mannerism is nailed down to perfection. Christina Ricci also turns in a very good performance, and is very convincing as the angsty, lonely lesbian teen who just wants to find someone she can connect with. The rest of the roles in the film are minor by comparison, but all are done well.

My only reason for giving this film four stars instead of five is the fact that it is just so depressing. It's not the kind of movie you'll want to see again. I loved it, and believe it was incredibly well done, but it doesn't leave one feeling very good about the world, except to be thankful for the things we tend to take for granted and that Aileen never got, like a loving family, supportive friends, education, and a chance at a rewarding career. Also, ""Monster"" isn't a movie for everyone. It's not very gory as far as serial killer films go, but it's certainly violent and disturbing. If you can generally handle such movies, however, I'd highly recommend it, as it's well worth seeing. However, because of the fact that it's simply not the kind of film you'd want to see over and over again, I'd suggest it as a rental rather than a purchase.",1102204800,4,5667,4.673346693386773

1518626,5,B00005JMUK,"Having seen the HBO specials on the real life Aileen, and hearing all about how Charliz Theron transformed herself to play the part to Oscar's applaudes, I was anxious to see this film.

I was riveted to my place, absolutely spellbound by Theron's performance.  She so drowned herself in this character that she literally had ""breakdown moments"" on the set during filming (see this on the featurette with great behind the scenes coverage with director and costars)  She notes that every film has their 2 or 3 ""hard"" scenes to film, but this entire picture was a hard scene.

The knowledge that it's based on a true story makes you pay more attention to the details, to the history behind Aileen's sad life the reasons she hated men, the disdain she held for her family, in particular her dad.

Christina Ricci's portrayal of lesbian lover, Selby Wall, is wonderful, however, it bothered me to see how she provided the straw that broke the camel's back with Aileen.  Had Selby been self-sufficient and truly loved Aileen, she would not have demanded so much money for silly things; at one point in the film she comes home from an afternoon of drinking in the bar, loaded with ""groceries"" that she said they needed, however, Aileens checks the packages and pulls out a stuffed animal!

She wanted to travel, go to Fun World - an amusement park, and basically live off of Aileen's money.  Selby was childish and immature, had only half a conscience, and this is the shame of the story, since Aileen looked to her as the savior that rescued her from suicide, and gave her something to dream of and hope for...a better, normal life.  In the end, Selby betrays Aileen, the killer takes full blame for her brutal actions and Selby disappears free and clear of any blame.

The murder scenes, in particular one that is completely senseless and gut-wrenching, are enough to make you lose sleep at night.  This film haunted me for some time after viewing it, and though my heart went out to the abused and lost child that once was Aileen Wouronos, I cannot agree that her messed up early life was the reason for her choice of prostitution and murder as a way of living.  Her heartbreaking childhood couldn't be changed, but the roads she took in later years led to deeper trouble, and ultimately to her execution in prison in October, 2002.

The true sadness of this woman's life and death is that had the right people reached out to her, things could have been better.",1101686400,2,2458,4.648960739030023
1518627,5,B00005JMUK,"Having watched the trial of Eileen on Court TV many years ago, I believe Theron did more than acting in this film; she brought Eileen back to life.  The entire cast was magnificent, the film was shot exactly the way it should have been.  You felt like you were watching something seedy and disturbing, which is exactly what her life was all about.  Trying to justify that many murders based on a single sexual violation was insane.  I am glad the film told the tale as close to what it probably truly was.",1101600000,,505,4.397849462365591

1518629,4,B00005JMUK,"This is a brutally told but compelling version of the Aileen Wuornos story.  She was a deranged psycho, sure, but Charlize Theron's ""monster"" performance also allowed us an insider's view into the woman and her troubled past.  While there can be no excusing her actions, this movie makes it possible at least to understand why she turned to prostitution, and then ultimately to murder.

Christina Ricci is also excellent as the lonely lesbian who befriends Wuornos, and inadvertently, at least at first, sparks the violence that rages within Wuornos' troubled mind.  As the story unfolds however, the tough hooker becomes putty-like in the hands of the disatisfied, nagging girlfriend, falling deeper and deeper into trouble, in an effort to buy happiness for their most unlikely partnership.

While certainly disturbing and at times depressing, you'll find yourself unable to turn away, even though you already know how this story ends.

To assist the people who are watching this movie for the ...ummm.. ""Cinematic experience"", your chapters are six and fifteen on the DVD, and your new favorite song is ""Crimson and Clover"".

Well performed and directed, and thoroughly deserving of all the awards that have been heaped on it.

1518630,4,B00005JMUK,"'Monster' is not the first film that feature the life of Aileen Woumos -- Jean Smart did her role in made-for-TV film 'Aileen Woumos: The True Story' in 1992 (which I have not seen), and director Nick Bloomfield made TWO documentaries 'Aileen Wuomos: The Selling of a Serial Killer' in 1993 and 'Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer' in 2004.  So, what makes her life so compelling in this morbid way?

Though 'Monster' does not give the definite answer, it still attempts to shed a light on the life of this serial killer in terms of her relations to another woman named Selby (Christina Ricci).  As you know, Charlize Theron gives very convincing acting as Aileen who finds a hope of life in this lonely girl, which turns out short-lived and more pernicious than she at first imagined.

The story is surprisingly simple.  Aileen meets Selby at a bar, and Selby, knowing that her relation with Aileen would be looked down as indecent by her father and relatives, keeps on meeting her, and fell for her.  Finally Selby leaves the home, and begins a new life with Aileen, but later she comes to realize that Aileen killed a guy, and she just cannot stop killing men, even the totally innocent ones.

Don't try to seek 'truths' about the killer and her life.  The strength of 'Monster' lies more in its obviously fictionalized (so I believe) part of Aileen who seeks desperately something in life, than in the reveiled facts themselves, which the film hardly has.  The film leaves out many things -- such as Aileen's marriage, and at least one killing is depicted as self-defence (as the real Aileen claimed) -- but whether or not you trust that part, it's up to you.  Me?  Not at all.

The unremarkable script (which is full of predictable turns) works simply because it is supported by two good acting from Theron and Ricci.  Though Theron underwent a physical change with make-ups and special diet, it is her performance that makes the film compelling.

The film is at its best when it describes Aileen's incredibly naive outlook on life, which plays one of the basic part of the whole story.  The idea of showing that aspect of her is original, but otherwise the film itself is not as great as many critics' raving reviews would lead us to think.  And as to Ms. Theron's prosthetics, well, I guess it's time to stop that trick.  Like Nicole Kidman who won the Oscar 'by the nose,' and whose career suddenly started to look unimpressive, I think it brings a bad luck.  And have you ever seen 'The Life and Death of Peter Sellers' or 'Head in the Clouds' both of which feature Charlize Theron, and went nowhere?",1100476800,,2616,4.613390928725702
1518651,2,B00005JMUK,"Monster tells the story of Aileen Wuornos , a vagabond prostitute and one of America's first female serial killers. The film picks up just before she begins the killing spree that claimed the lives of nine men, many clients of the enterprising lady-of-the-night, murdered in cars or deep in the woods where they were to partake in her services.

The director of the film (Patty Jenkins) uses the life of Wournos to comment on what she sees as the evils of contemporary society. But the target of Jenkins's film is not the killer, but rather a society that the film suggests led Wuornos to commit her crimes. The true villains of the world (according to Jenkins) are not serial killers, but rather capitalism, patriarchy and homophobia. These are the true ""monsters"" of the film, as they are the real reason nine men died at the hands of our hero.

OK, maybe calling her the film's ""hero"" is a bit of a stretch, but the film does work very hard trying to add humanity to a woman who (let me say this again) murdered nine men. Her childhood is sad, her dreams are shattered, and she can't get a real job because her only previous employment consisted of wanking winkies. Therefore, the only thing left for her to do is...start killing people.

What I see as dangerous about this movie is that it is indeed based on a real woman and nearly all the facts in the film are true. But this film shows how a write/director can use facts to produce a thesis that doesn't necessarily grow naturally from the story itself. Many people will walk away from this film buying the ideas that drive the film, because (they will say) it is based on fact and must be true.

In the hands of a less ""enlightened"" director, the film would portray a very different Aileen Wuornos. Rather than pointing criticism out at the world around her, a more responsible filmmaker would force the criticism to point back at the star of the film, the monstrous Aileen Wuornos.",1100044800,6,1940,4.566091954022989
1518652,5,B00005JMUK,"Monster. For some reason, the title fit well for how the world treated Aileen Wornos when she was alive. But for some people she was the real monster, not the victims she murdered when she was alive.

The story began with a picture of Aileen Wuornos, sitting under the bridge with a gun in her hand, in the most lowest point of her life, where she was completely lost & feeling hopeless. With a monologue for the insights of the history of her life, it rewinds back to a young lesbian, who was taking her first steps to come out from the closet - regardless how her family objections, named Selby. Selby was a shy, lonely lesbian, struggling to find a perfect start to get a compainion, I guess, and decided to go to a gay bar to try her chances. And there, she met the pathetic, messed up looking blonde woman, who was a bit of homophobic at first, who introduced herself as Aileen.

After spending time together, Selby & Aileen got emotionally attracted and Aileen decided she would get some money for their next date by hooking bit earlier that day so she could treat Selby. Unfortunately for her, she the last customer of the night, she met the most horrible man that would effect the rest of her life. She got beaten & rape not to forget, he almost killed her, if she wouldn't had escape the bondage he put her in when she was out, and killed her out of self defence.

Honestly speaking, yes, she would have done better if reporting it to the police, but since she was a hooker, would she really had a chance in court? - but then again, I guess she loved Selby that much, she afraid, she might lose her if she didn't come for their date.

So, this was the beginning mark of their field trip together escaping the authorities, and Aileen, despite people not giving her a chance to change her lifestyle with a legal job for a chance, more accurately kind of blew her off and humiliate her in the process as well - she went back hooking.

But never did she realize, the experience with the guy who she killed once, left her with a phobia. A foreplay reminded her of him and fear crept up, scared that this guy is just the same with the guy she murdered. That he might kill her too. So she killed her first 'innocent' victim - I say 'innocent' since he was married and still went out to get a hooker (seriously what kind of man is that?) - she stole his money and car.

Later on their misfit adventure, Selby - who I feel lazy and a golddigger - grew away from Aileen, decided to go out and be with another lesbian. Seriously, if that other lesbian didn't meet up with her old fling, Selby would had had broke up with Aileen and run off to her, but she didn't and Selby felt alone again, with her tail between her legs, cuddle with Aileen once more.

Mostly at the end, Selby just betrayed Aileen - I guess she just wish to get a better looing lesbian gf than her in the inside - and turned Aileen in to the authorities to pointing guilty directions at her. And what I don't get is, Selby should had had gone spend time in prison too, but she didn't. She knew but she didn't spend time. Now that's a bit sad, and infuriating.

Bottomline, this movie has open up a few cans of worms discussions about death penalty and murderers. Referring to her traumatized childhood and experiences, did she really deserved it or not. For what I care, I think she be better off spending the rest of her time in a mental instituition and death. But then again, death perhaps was a blessing for her life full of miseries. But then again, do we really have the right to take a life away from a living person? Evil or not?",1100044800,,3604,4.2897058823529415
1518653,5,B00005JMUK,"Charlize Theron is absolutely brilliant in her portrayal of serial killer, Aileen Wournos. Her Academy Award winning performance is flawless as she takes you into the dark underside of a psychopath.  Christina Ricci is also great in her role opposite Theron.

Although the story is discomforting, disturbing, and provocative, you will find yourself drawn into it and wondering how someone can end up so tragically.  Prostituting herself as a young teenager and living on the streets, Wournos' early life is almost incomprehensible to the average person.

This is not a horror film per se, but you will be horrified at what you see.",1099612800,,631,5.097087378640777

Second, We do what we feel is right in our own lives. If any of us had lived her life, we would certainly look at this world in a different perspective. All she was trying to do was find a way to live the American Dream. I have to have compassion for the people who REALLY lived this story, and also the actresses and actors who had to put them selves in the place of true to life characters. This is an amazing film, and if you can think outside the box for 2hrs. I reccomend this film. I was absolutely speechless in the end, and touched beyond belief.

1518655,3,B00005JMUK,"For starters, Charlize Theron gives a landmark performance as serial-killer Aileen Wuornos as the Oscar and other testimonials will attest to.  Her performance is not all make-up, prosthetics and weight gain.  Theron gets inside the skin of this used and abused and ultimately evil individual.  Christina Ricci matches her as her naive lover and unwitting accomplice.  Also, any film that features Bruce Dern, albeit in a smallish role, is aces in my book.  As tawdry as the tale here is, it is not done in an exploitative manner.  That said, this is not the type of film I care to re-visit very often.  It's a compelling yet not very pleasurable experience.  If you have to see one serial killer movie, then this is probably the one to see.",1099008000,,741,4.734375

VOMIT.  She looked disgusting throughout the thing and did well.  Great performances and DEFINATELY well deserved Oscars.  Very, very well directed, too.  Christina Ricci was also good as the whiney sidekick of the serial killer...

GAH!  I should keep a thinking-about-that-woman-from-Monster vomiting bucket on hand at all times.  Charlize just looked much prettier in Mighty Joe Young is all I'm sayin'.",1098662400,,578,5.322222222222222
1518657,2,B00005JMUK,"This is a sanctamonious portrayal of a truly evil woman.  I realize that movies take liberties with true stories, but ""Monster"" portrays Wournos as some sort of victim and martyr when she was really just a psychopath who killed innocent people for money. I wouldn't even have a problem with it if perhaps it changed the character names (like ""Badlands"" did), or perhaps stylized the movie a little more (ala ""Bonnie and Clyde"") so it doesn't feel like a docu-drama. But instead, the very fictional ""Monster"" OPENS with the phrase ""based on a true story"".

Theron gives an adequate performance, but there is no real soul or layers to the character. Theron's Wourons is a Florida white-trash version of Joan of Ark. She does a little better than an imitation of this idealized version of Wournos. It's obvious she won the Oscar because she is a young, attractive acress slumming it in a dark movie where she had to gain about 10 pounds. It's not a fully realized character, like Hilary Swank in ""Boys Don't Cry"", which this movie often imitates.

""Monster"" and the two Nick Broomfield documentaries are a complete waste of your time.",1097971200,4,1131,4.78974358974359
1518658,4,B00005JMUK,"The movie script is based on a true story about Aileen ""Lee"" Wuornos (Charlize Theron), a prostitute who killed her johns and stole their money. She did it because she wanted to support her lesbian lover Selby (Christina Ricci). The film starts with their chance meeting in a bar Aileen has entered not knowing it is a gay/lesbian hangout. Selby offers Aileen to spend the night in her bed where she is discovered by her guardian Donna. They arrange a meeting the following night but Aileen is late. She was brutally raped and in self defense kills her assailant and takes his car and money. The rape scene is very disturbing and difficult to watch. Theron excels in the following scene where she murders the rapist. Particularly memorable is the scream she releases at the end, right before she looses consciousness. Afterwards Aileen still manages to meet with Selby and offers to take care of her. The two of them run away and make some motel room their home.

Soon after the money runs out and Aileen tries to earn some and disgusted by her last john, decides to leave prostitution. This is the weakest part of the movie. Aileen tries to get a regular job and is turned down on many occasions. She even tries to get a job as a secretary at a lawyer's office. I'm not sure what was the point of those scenes. If the author tried to build some kind of sympathy in the viewers for Aileen she failed because in some scenes she looks almost comical and I'm sure that was not Patty Jenkins intention. After her last job interview, with the lawyer, she is taken away by a policeman who knows she is a prostitute.

Aileen then realizes that her only option is prostitution and she takes to the highway again. The following scene in which she realizes that she can repeat the murder is the most memorable in the movie. The performance of Theron is simply brilliant as her eyes and body language shows the conflict, realization and finally the decision to commit another murder. This time Aileen does it much easier and shows less remorse.

The romance between Aileen and Selby suffers when Selby starts going out and meeting new lesbian friends. Aileen is left on the side to watch but comes to term with the situation. Ricci portrays Selby very well as a spoiled and weak teenager trying to fight for her life choices. Her performance is good but never matches Theron.

Aileen continues to kill her johns and provides for Selby but makes a fatal mistake when she kills a police officer which offered to help her. Selby has a car accident in one of the stolen cars and they are seen together by an elderly couple. Police starts to tighten the noose around them and releases their sketches on TV. Aileen realizes that they are going to be caught and sends Selby to her father. She is then caught and Selby is a star witness in her trial. Aileen is sentenced to death and executed after spending 12 years on death row.

The movie is presented in 1,85:1 widescreen. Picture quality is very good with well defined color and no visible digital artifacts. I was a bit disappointed with sound quality. Even though there is 5.1 DTS mix available as an option the sound is sometimes poorly mixed. In some scenes it is difficult to follow the dialogue because it is obscured by music and sound effects.

The special features include:

Featurette This is a 16 minute Making of ""Monster"" documentary which features interviews with Charlize Theron and Patty Jenkins. Theron talks about a research trip she took with Patty Jenkins while preparing for the role. She visited some of the places where Aileen lived and spent her time. They talk how they read her letters which she wrote in the last years of her life and talked with her childhood friend. The there is a part about the makeup where we see a bit of work necessary to transform Theron into Aileen. We get a short glimpse at working on location and see some of the creative process Charlize Theron used in creating the character of Aileen. One interesting line Theron says in the interview: ""There is no way to get the story right, because there is so much happening in a persons life that it is impossible."" That is true, and that is why I don't like ""based on a true story"" movies, because they are never right.

International Trailer

Monster ""Surrounded"" is a brief bit about surround mixing of the sound and the score for the movie.

Film Mixing Demo This is an interesting interactive demo where you can isolate or mix sound effect and dialogues from some scenes in the movie. It is interesting but with no long term value since it quickly becomes boring. Also, it feels like it doesn't belong to a DVD with this sort of movie. It would be a nice edition to a movie like ""Monsters inc"" but here it just seems out of place.

Interview With Patty Jenkins & BT This is a longer documentary about the evolution of a musical score for the movie. BT is a young composer who made his name in ""Fast and Furious"" movie and was a bit of a surprise for this kind of movie but in my opinion it turned out great. The score is very good and reflects the mood of the movie but it is a shame that it is sometimes too loud and obscures the dialogue.

This is a very good movie but it is nowhere near the five star rating. It is closer to three stars but the amazing performance of Charlize Theron earns the fourth star. The Oscar is well deserved. Even though her face is filled with makeup and prosthetics she manages to portray all the emotions the character is experiencing. The makeup team led by Toni G (Dawn of the Dead, Planet of the Apes) also deserves a big applause for their work. Her performance is a great example of total immersion in the role. She had to gain almost 30 pounds to give her the required look.

The biggest problem of the movie is its apologetic story toward the main character. The movie is full of references to Aileen's hard life and the abuse she suffered as a child. But hard life is no excuse for murder. Half the population of the planet would be murderers if it was so. The script is based on the stories Aileen told her bunkmate in prison. But are those stories true or are they the product of a deranged mind of a convicted killer, we will never know. So this story is one dimensional, from a point of view of a killer. There is no mention of the suffering she caused by killing those men, the loss their families had to endure. Her first victim, the rapist is a despicable human being but, what are his reasons to act that way. Did he had a hard life as well?",1097625600,3,6548,4.468619246861925
1518659,5,B00005JMUK,"Several reviewers have said that they expected the film to be about a serial killer who happens to be a lesbian, not vice versa. Let's keep in mind that Wuornos was not a lesbian at the beginning. She became infatuated with a woman because this was the only human being that was interested in even talking to her. Wuornos was so intensely desperate for meaningful human contact that she would have done anything to prolong the romance with Selby Wall, including murder.

This film has boiled down the most distressing human experiences: homelessness, failure, shame, regret, isolation, substance abuse, etc. Its depiction of this is so real that you will truly feel something. And that is what watching a movie is supposed to be about.",1096934400,4,735,4.88

I guess it really boils down to taste but this movie didn't exactly do it for me. Thats not to say that Therons performance wasn't absolutley amazing, she does well and proves that shes not just a pretty face, Christina Ricci also does a great job as Selby. The film is based on the life of Aileen Wuronos(?) the first female serial killer who was executed in Florida in 2002(?). As we start off the film Theron is sitting under a bridge contemplating suicide, she goes into a gay bar, not really caring where she is heading, and buys a drink. After meeting Selby Wall, Aileen has a new motivation and believes she is in love with Wall. Another reviewer summed up my thoughts perfectly when they wrote ""I thought this was a film about a serial killer who happened to be a lesbian, not a lesbian who happened to be a serial killer"". I thought the film would be more focused on Aileens killings and life, then her relationship with Selby, also I really didn't find any chemistry between Aileen and Selby. Having said that this film is definetly not bad, its a well above average film, just really not my kind.

1518693,3,B00005JMUK,"Let it be known that this column will not serve as a pro/con platform to such popular debates as capital punishment or judiciary bias toward homosexuality and prostitution, all three of which are readily apparent in the film ""Monster."" Furthermore, neither will this review compare the events seen in the film to those documented in reality, nor will it address Aileen Wuornos' plea that her homicidal deeds were in self-defense.

Instead, the purpose of this piece is to praise the impeccable transformation of a South African model into America's most infamous female serial killer, Aileen Carol Wuornos. It's a performance so stunning that your humble critic trembled on more than one occasion during the film.

Prior to ""Monster,"" Charlize Theron was relatively unknown. Her roles were never daring or eye-popping. In fact, perhaps her most memorable part was that of the charming Candy Kendall alongside Tobey Maguire in John Irving's ""The Cider House Rules."" Besides that, leading roles in such critically lambasted motion pictures as ""Reindeer Games"" and ""The Astronaut's Wife"" had partially tainted Theron's acting rsum. What's more, the longer Theron hung on to her glamorous sex appeal, the longer critics would disavow recognition of any real talent.

It wasn't until ""Monster"" writer-director Patty Jenkins approached Theron with the assignment of portraying the freshly executed mass murderer Wuornos that Theron saw an opportunity to acquire earnest critical appraisal.

Theron has said that when she accepted Jenkins' proposal to play Wuornos she wasn't fully aware of the physical demands. She didn't have the faintest clue as to how drastic the metamorphosis would be, because she wasn't familiar with Wuornos. Rather, she took the role to see how far she could push herself. Theron went on to admit that the task was as daunting as any she'd tackled.

By poring over dozens of death-row letters and studying news footage of Wuornos, Theron was able to duplicate her masculine mannerisms and vile thought processes.

In an interview, Theron relayed the secret to internalizing Wuornos. Theron stated that though she thought her character study stemmed from the outside in, it was, in fact, completely the opposite. It wasn't until Theron began to conduct serious research that all the physical aspects of Wuornos revealed themselves.

As good as the characterization might be, Theron required a makeover and serious weight gain to complete the transformation. With the assistance of renowned makeup artist Toni G, Theron's silky locks were reduced to Frankenstein's Bride status. Her faultless teeth became tobacco-stained and crooked. Her gorgeous turquoise eyes were made a soulless black, and her eyebrows were plucked to oblivion.

Like Nicole Kidman before her, who donned a prosthetic nose and an incredibly chapped upper lip for her depiction of Virginia Woolf in ""The Hours,"" Theron's metamorphosis is worthy of the golden statuette for Best Actress.",1096243200,,2975,5.355460385438972
1518694,3,B00005JMUK,"I had been lookng forward to this movie from the day they commenced shooting it.  I must say that it left me feeling cold and slightly uninspired. Yes, Theron's performance is engaging and it is worth watching for this reason.

However it is not the movie that I had hoped to have seen. I found myself feeling sympathy for the character of Wournos and I didn't want to.  Yes she had a disgraceful childhood, yes she was beaten up by several men (one in a very brutal way), yes her future looked grim but there are thousands of women all throughout America whom are living this life. It is not an excuse for murder.

Having read quite a bit on the Wournos case I would rather have seen a movie about a woman who was kicked at her lowest time and time again and made the wrong choice and went down the pathway of destruction. Wournos supposedly said to many of her friends throughout her adult life that she would be famous in one way or another. She was even quoted as saying that she was going to be like a female Jesse James and be idolised and adored by woman the world over for being an outlaw and getting rid of men. I also think that in the film Ricci's character is the one controlling all the shots. However from what I have read Wournos was also very domineering and controlling and whilst she may have been more desperate and needy of the relationship she also was said to have had the upper hand on her real life lover.

You never quite get this feeling in the movie.

Ricci, whom I usually enjoy on the screen is nothing short of painful. Her voice goes right through you and her character is at times more of a monster than Wournos.

Ms. Theron has had some interesting roles, (Cider House Rules, The Italian Job) but this role is the defining one of her career up to now and shows us just how well she can act.  Had she relied solely on the amazing makeup and weight gain for the role that transformed her physically, Charlize would not have been able to convince us that she was Aileen Wournos.  But she took that step a really good actor or actress makes to really become the person she is portraying and really made the role believable and thorougly watchable. Christina Ricci was also good as the young woman, who beguiles Wournos and then betrays her once the truth is revealed about her killing spree.  But it is Theron who shines and absolutely deserved the Academy Award she won for this role.  I look forward, with great anticipation, to the roles she chooses in the future and I highly recommend this film featuring such an amazing performance.",1095724800,,1070,4.7005347593582885
1518697,4,B00005JMUK,"Monster, starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci is a disturbing film based on the true story of a destitute, drug-addicted prostitute and serial killer, Aileen Wuornos. For me, the best part of the film is the stunning performance by Charlize Theron as she transforms herself completely into the Wuornos character, both physically and psychologically. Her every move, and inflection of her voice is impeccable in her portrayal. Theron's 2004 Academy Award for best actress is well deserved. Christina Ricci's performance as Wuornos's lover is incredible. I had no prior knowledge of the true events of Aileen Wuornos's life before watching Monster, therefore, I am only commenting on the merits of the film, its cast, and writer/director Patty Jenkins. The make-up artist, Toni G, who expertly transformed Theron into Wuornos, did an amazing job. She turns a beautiful model into a person who had clearly never taken care of herself, and had abused her body most of her life.

Monster is a very sad story of a girl who is so depressed she contemplates suicide, which in retrospect would have saved the lives of seven men. One rainy night, at her lowest point, Aileen ends up in a sleazy gay bar where she is picked up by Selby-a lonely girl whose true ambition is to get away from her fundamentalist father, and the aunt she was sent to live with. Aileen tells Selby to get lost, that she's not gay, but she ends up spending the night in the girl's bed anyway. They just sleep, but the relationship develops into much more as time passes. It seems Aileen has never experienced love, or a semblance of it, in her entire life. Even though the movie did not leave me happy, I could not stop watching it. Not knowing the story before hand increased my suspense. I was mesmerized by Theron and Ricci's performances. I could see what caused Wuornos to snap and kill the john who physically beat her almost to death, but I was horrified that she was able to kill repeatedly. The fact that Wuornos was sexually abused as a child, uneducated, and unloved had a lot to do with the way she turned out. Her background cannot be overlooked. Though not an excuse for committing murder, Aileen justifies her actions by feeling that men aren't worthy of living...they are all dangerous predators. At one point in the film, Wournos expresses a desire to turn her life around and find a respectable job. Her attempts end in failure, but she is desperate to keep Selby happy. Selby encourages Aileen to keep tricking in order to avoid being hungry, and to continue having a good time. Alcohol, drugs, food, and motel rooms cost money, and if Aileen can't get a real job, she'll have to remain a hooker. I don't think Selby planned on Aileen's brutally murdering the men she enticed, but she's sure happy with the money.

What bothered me about the film, beside the story itself, is that Hollywood thinks nothing of showing heavy petting between two women, but they loathe, or are too afraid to show the same situation with two men. I feel Hollywood has the responsibility to depict loving LGBT relationships instead of concentrating on the dregs of society. While Monster did not glorify lesbian relationships, I honestly believe that Aileen truly loved Selby Wall on some level. The love scenes were more than convincing without being too graphic, even though Wuornos claimed she was not gay. Perhaps she used the excuse of love to justify killing her johns--after taking their money and cars. Another take would be that Aileen would have loved anyone who cared about her. You have to wonder if Selby really loved Aileen, or if she was just using her to escape her homophobic family. Either way, it's a tragic story all around--but still worth watching.

Do I recommend the movie? The answer would have to be yes, and no. I think the movie was very well made, but I don't think depressing movies are for everyone. No matter how you look at it, Wuornos was a murderer. Even though she was abused and neglected as a child, and didn't have anyone who cared about her, nor did she have a good role model, she was still responsible for her own actions. In the beginning, Monster makes the audience sympathetic towards Aileen...she is so pitiful. When she's seeking honest employment, even when she fell in love with Selby, I felt myself rooting for her to turn her life around. However, when she started killing all those men, she became a monster and had to be stopped. I prefer feel-good movies, but sometimes you need a downer to put life in perspective.",1094428800,2,4540,4.744303797468355
1518698,5,B00005JMUK,"Since 2000, it seems as though the only actresses to win Best Actress Oscars are the ones that are scrumptiously  beautiful in real life, but ... dress down for their movies.  Arguably, Julia Roberts did this in ""Erin Brockovich"" in 2000, Halle Berry in 2001, and Nicole Kidman in 2002 ... which brings us to Charlize Theron in 2003.

But luckily Charlize gave us an INCREDIBLE and SHOCKING performance to match the incredible and shocking makeup she had to wear in Monster.  Her Oscar is well-deserved.  And it's a shame Cristina Ricci's performance wasn't recognized.  AND ... I'm not really sure all of the murders featured in the movie could be deemed ""brutal"" other than the first one we're shown on-screen.  In real life I'm sure they were, but ... the movie is mainly a basic love story, and less emphasis is put on the murders.  The second-to-last scene (where Selby and Aileen are on the phone) will reduce you to tears, and in a way ... we actually feel sorry for Aileen and I think that was the intent of the movie.

ANYWAY, I usually go off on tangents, but ... the first half of the 2000s, like I said, was all about actresses dressing down, REALLY down.  I just hope that 2004's winner (which I'm predicting will be Annette Bening) will not have to dress down just to win an Oscar, because acting should come from the inside and not the outside.

BY THE WAY ... Annette Bening did NOT wind up winning like I thought she would.  The winner (for the second time) was Hilary Swank, the ""million dollar baby.""  Someday Annette!

Christina Rucci performance has the native Selby works so well in contrast with Theron's strong and independent character that two have incredibly chemistry.

But one night after Alieen is rapped, she kills the man and knows she just can't go on hooking again.

1518720,4,B00005JMUK,"There should have been more extras on this DVD, but it is a handy way to preserve Charlize Theron's performance in a difficult part, the performance that netted her this year's Academy Award for Best Performance by a Lead Actress.  Some of the extras show her in different stages of makeup, and also researching with the director the very places the real life Aileen Wuornos used to frequent, down in Florida on the ugly side.  I thought Scott Wilson also deserved a nomination, he had also a very resonant part as the last man Aileen managed to kill, the one who tried to help her, who was a family man, thus showing that Aileen had become addicted to murder and that her excuses for murdering these men (""they tried to molest me"") had grown paper thin with repetition, even though the first one really did try to murder her and raped her in an ugly way, and yet when the audience watches Scott Wilson die for apparently no reason at all, we're brought back to our memories of him as a handsome young man playing one of the heartless killers in Richard Brooks' IN COLD BLOOD, and we feel that Movie Karma has played a part in deciding his fate.

Christina Ricci was pretty good too, though I wonder what the real-life person she's playing had to say about Ricci's portrayal of her as a user, a whiner, a sloth, a slut, and one who would sell out the only person who ever cared for her in the world.

Now that the movie OPEN WATER has come out, with its leading actress Blanchard Ryan who is an exact duplicate of the ""pretty"" Charlize Theron, will we ever see that one again or will we always be seeing the grim one with the Lon Chaney makeup?  That would be a loss because Theron was so alluring in THREE DAYS IN THE VALLEY and THE ITALIAN JOB etc.",1092960000,2,1750,4.355828220858895
1518721,5,B00005JMUK,"As everyone else has mentioned, Charlize Theron is absolutely brilliant in this film. She plays her character with such emotion. In the movie you get into Aileen Wuornos' head as she becomes a serial killer. It is a dark movie filled with prostitution and violence, but is realistic. Get ready for a wild ride of a movie that will put you into a trance with much thanks to Ms. Theron. You also learn about Aileen's lover, played by Christina Ricci. She battles her family were are unnexcepting of her 'ways'. Highly recommended!",1092873600,,528,4.75
1518722,4,B00005JMUK,"Even though I expected this film to be more violent and depressing-it was really more about the dysfunctional relationship between Aileen (Charlize) and her girlfriend, Selby (Christina Ricci). I am a big fan of Christina Ricci-she's a real unusual actress and always gets these awesome roles. Like some of the other reviewers I also saw that there was no on screen chemistry between Ricci and Charlize. However, separately they acted very well. The writer and director minimized Aileen's character to a more likeable individual, one that you could have some grain of sympathy for. However, had Charlize been given a chance to play a more intense, crazed Aileen, I bet she would have done it well. So, I wished this movie was less of a love story and more of a ""Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer"" type, because the love story part was getting a little played out toward the end. For these reasons I subtract 1 star-(acting excluded).",1092873600,3,934,4.84375
1518723,4,B00005JMUK,"I was actually hesitant to see this, simply because, while I had followed the case of Wuornos, I had never been a full out Charlize Theron fan, judging her work based on 'Sweet November' and 'Devil's Advocate,' essentially I perceived her as attractive set dressing.

Man, did Monster ever make me eat my words!  Theron delivers a true, jaw-droppingly good, transformative performance.  Having seen many documentaries on Wuornos, I was familliar with her, and Theron absolutely channels this woman.  Her physical transformation alone is brilliant, but the way she adds a depth of humanity and pathos to a very unsympathetic person is astounding.  It's not just a question of good 'mimickry,' but you actually do learn about how Aileen viewed the world, and can see it from her point of view, based solely on Theron's heartbreaking performance.  It truly is well worth purchasing this DVD, because work this good is rare.

The story, however, leaves alot to be desired.  While not a bad retelling, certain facts are smudged, and the character Selby never existed, and is not as fully developed.  But the flaws are minor in light of Theron's no-jolds-barred attempt to humanize a serial killer who seemingly had no soul.",1092787200,2,1218,5.019900497512438

1518725,3,B00005JMUK,"First off, go back and see how many people are trying to chuck their used copies of this film.  As of this review the total was 141 ""merchants.""  One of the reasons for this is that watching this film more than once is nearly impossible without being totally disgusted with the story.  The only redeeming factor is a phenomenal performance from Charlize Theron, in a miraculous transformation that needs to be seen to be believed.  She is incredible!  As for the character she plays, it is really hard to feel any sympathy for her beyond one particular incident where she certainly had just cause for murder in self-defense.  The other killings are unjustified except in her own warped mind.  Yes, she had a horrible life, and yes, she seems to attract mountains of garbage that fall on her whenever she begins to become hopeful.  As for her counterpart in the film, played by Christina Ricci, she only seems able to whine and complain throughout the story in a needling way that becomes annoying by the end of the film.  As for Charlize Theron's performance, this film gets 5 stars!  As for the story and film, it's just too repellent to be viewed more than once.  I do recommend watching this movie via a movie rental, for Charlize Theron's performance is stellar.  But I do not recommend buying the DVD.  I saw it once, and that was certainly enough.",1092700800,5,1353,4.6344537815126055
1518726,4,B00005JMUK,"When Aileen Wournos was at large, I was in my teens and living in Central Florida, following the story with sick fascination.  I grew up in Marion County, and the first thing I looked for when I saw this movie was accurate depiction of the area, accents, and overall look of the sets. Gotta say, I felt like I was home again.

Charlize Theron goes through a major transformation for this movie, where she plays Central Florida serial killer, Aileen Wournos. Not only is the make up and the extra thirty pounds striking as she was uglied down for this role, but her mannerisms, accent and general attitude complete the illusion. Charlize looks so much like Aileen Wournos that when you put her picture next to the real killer's, the resemblance is so uncanny that it gives chills. She also looks a lot like James Hetfield of Metallica fame, but then, so did Aileen Wournos.

Her performance is perfect, and Christina Ricci as her selfish, lesibian lover gives a performance that is also well worth watching. Ignorant of her lover's crimes, she pushes her to make more money for them, never realizing until much later that the money is coming from the dead men that are appearing all over Central Florida.

Are we expected to feel sorry for Aileen Wournos now that we have the background on how and why she snapped and became this monster? Are we supposed to be sorry that we went to the electric chair? No. While this movie shows us that Aileen's first murder was in self defense, and the second murder was made easier by the post traumatic stress of her first experience, we also see that the other killings are completely calculated and her victims were generally innocent people. Briefly, we see her anguish at killing during an especially disturbing murder scene, but Wournos was not that sorry, so that scene doesn't inspire sympathy for her so much as it leaves a person feeling cold.

I would have given this movie five stars except for one thing. The relationship she has with Shelby (Ricci) is too drawn out and slow in developing at first. Then, it seems to be more important than the murders, because we have more screen time with Theron and Ricci making out, arguing, or otherwise planning their next move than we do anything else, which seems to put the murders on the backburner.

However, if you want disturbing non-fiction, this movie disturbs on two levels. The first is Charlize Theron herself. She is freakin' amazing. The second is the actual story. It is very hard to watch, but you will be glad you did.",1092528000,,2524,4.6606741573033705
1518727,5,B00005JMUK,"There's little that can be added to this forum regarding the Oscar-winning ""Monsters"".  Theron is unbelievably both grotesquely repulsive yet appealing as Aileen Wuornos, a woman that a ""monstrous"" society shaped.  Ricci, as always, is in fine form as Wuornos' companion.  After appearing frequently in films of late, it's refreshing to see Bruce Dern as Aileen's supportive friend.

As I watched the film, I found myself in awe of the lengths that Miss Theron took in tackling this role, turning her strikingly beautiful good looks into something unrecognizable yet totally captivating.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences got this one dead on the mark when it awarded the actress with its coveted ""Best Actress"" Oscar.

It would've been a greater honor if director Jenkins had won, too!",1092441600,,801,5.170542635658915
1518757,5,B00005JMUK,"In ""Monster,"" writer-director Patty Jenkins' retelling of the story of serial killer Aileen Wuornos, Charlize Theron gives an Oscar winning performance that will go down in history as one of the best ever captured on film. Theron, a moderate actress previously seen in ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""The Italian Job,"" is a revelation in this wonderfully executed film. Her transformation into the disturbed Aileen Wuornos is so complete and so devestating that part of me still can't believe that it's her.

Aileen Wuornos was an abused child that eventually turned to highway prostitution to stay alive. When we first see Aileen, her face is in extreme close up, and it is dirty and battered, just like her soul is beaten down by the horrific life she has endured. Aileen is on the verge of suicide, but her life changes forever when she meets and falls in love with Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) a young lesbian who wants a better life but doesn't want to do the work to achieve it. The two embark on an odd couple romance, and their passionate meeting scenes set the screen aflame. Then Aileen picks up a man who brutally rapes her, and she kills him before he can take her life. She and Selby then make a tenative life together, while Aileen slowly goes off the deep end, killing more men. Selby seems to know nothing about the murders, but she is not as naive as she appears.

Charlize Theron plays Aileen Wuornos with a combination of breathtaking ferocity, unexpected humor, unbearable pain, and passionate devotion. She is so increibly real in the part you forget that it's acting. The movie does not condone Wuornos' crimes. Her scenes of killing are painful to watch, but it also paints a portrait of a woman who was utterly destroyed by life, whose last desperate grab for happiness fails. It is unforgettable. Theron's achievement can't be described in words, you just have to see it.

A great deal of ""Monster"" works because Christina Ricci is so perfect as Selby Wall. Ricci makes Selby a very complex young woman, who is aware of Aileen's crimes but says nothing as long as it benefits her. Selby seems to be naive and innocent, but she turns out to be far more calculating than the severely disturbed Aileen. Sometimes it's hard to decide who is the real monster. Ricci, one of the best young actresses around, really didn't get much attention for her part in ""Monster."" That's a shame, because without her perfect performance to match Theron's, the movie would't work.

""Monster"" is an astounding achievement. The caliber of acting, writing, and directing is incredible. As a film it is nearly flawless. It was made by a group of people who really cared about presenting Aileen Wuornos's story as well as possible, and they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.",1092009600,2,2776,4.789144050104384

Do not be misled by the many negative reviews.  The Academy knows its actors, and she deserved the award.  However, when viewing this movie, approach it with as little expectation as possible.  It is not meant to keep you on the edge of your seat.  It is a walk down the relationship of a serial killer and her lover.  It is very graphic and disturbing.  Many feel that the use of these tools was to ""Hollywoodize"" the story.  I disagree.  While much of the scenario seemed almost too simple or too outrageous, you must keep in mind...that the character would not carry on as we would.  Many reviewers felt that the story was horrible and that the use of sex and violence was for shock value.  It is not for shock value.  It is the life of this particular woman.  For those that want an thrilling and nail biting fictitious story, look elsewhere.  This movie is a walk into the dark, violent, and very real life of this serial killer, who despite the pain, love is able to find her.  Highly recommended; but take it at face value.  To reply to some negative reviews, keep in mind that there is nothing hollywoodized...as young women who live as Theron's character did...rarely take time to write a movie review; meaning, you can't say something is hollywoodized until you set foot into the shoes of this person that walks the street as so many others do.  You can't say something was ""hollywoodized"" until it happens to you...then you'll know the difference between reality and hollywood.

It turns out after viewing the movie and doing my research- this woman was simply made an example of without anyone making anybody accountable.

Okay to the movie. The movie is really about a woman who never had love and love finds her. She gets into a warm relationship and finds that the person she loves- is exactly the type of person she wish she could be. After all the hooking and selling herself- she is empty inside- all those dream disappeared. She finds those dreams in this special person. However, things change, when she is trying to make some money and a john, aka prostitute killer (this never came out until after her death), got a hold of her and made her snap- and kill. And to be honest rightfully so. The movie continues until she is caught.

This movie is so powerful. It makes you really think about how really lucky some of us are and I think what shook me throughout the whole movie...that she didn't care one bit about herself- but she loved this other person with all her heart. That she was so smart and yet not able to get herself out of hell.

The film is well directed and has good acting.

Subject-matter excluded, the film is a good character study.  By the end of the film, the audience can (if not accept) understand what factors in Aileen Wuornos' horrible life were responsible in turning her into a such a psychotic monster.  Being a low-end call girl walking the streets and the victim of many male creeps and perverts, its somewhat easy to see why she became a lesbian and a killer: not that this is any excuse for what she did.  The film actually wants to show how Wuornos' lover Selby (Christina Ricci) was encouraging her killing spree so that she could keep running from her relatives.  I could've done without the steamy love scenes though.

Again, although I hardly even have a modest interest in the gay film genre, this film was well acted and directed.  Charlize Theron truly deserved an Oscar for her role.",1091491200,2,1121,4.742268041237113

This will be the magnum opus of her career.  If she does nothing else worthwhile, Theron will be remembered for this one role and deservedly so.

The movie is about a female serial killer from Florida. Christina Ricci plays her lover in the film and she does a nice job.  Monster does a fine balancing act between showing compassion for Wuornos and her as a brutal killer.  Monster shows how Wurnos tried to go clean and how she became more violent after failing to go straight.  Highly Recommended.",1091318400,,823,4.613793103448276
1518766,3,B00005JMUK,"Though this film is brutally honest about Aileen 'Lee' Wuornos' crimes it does provoke some sympathy for her. Yes, she does kill many people (all men) but when you consider how many men battered her and raped her all through her life, even as a child, it's no surprise she became so psychotic.

And I don't think it's exactly fair that she got the death penalty. Surely it would have been best to help a woman who lived her entire existence in the dregs of society (which is surely to blame for sending her mad) than executing her.

Focusing entirely on Lee instead of the police investigations following her (there is a TV movie from the mid-90s that does exactly this if you're more interested), we see her straggle from thinking about suicide, hooking up with lonely, naive Selby (Christina Ricci), killing in self-defense and finally killing for revenge/money.

Charlize Theron completely vanishes as she brings her take on Lee (her full name is never mentioned in the film) to the screen. She sure deserved her Academy Award and Christina Ricca (who is very cute here) is also very good. However, for a lesbian couple I just didn't see any real feeling between them. It annoyed me how fast the film moved and there are not really many quiet moments for these two characters to bond in any way. Yes, they proclaim their love for each other but I just didn't see it. There was too much shouting and screaming.

There are no surprises in the film, as we all know how it ends anyway. But some of Lee's killings are harsh, compelling and even ironic. The overall effect of the film isn't so long-lasting on me though.

It's shot and lit like a TV movie and Lee's heavy judgment at the end of the film is played down. For a film that is slightly biased to her point of view it's annoying that her unfair trial and life are not exploited just a little bit more for us to gain a little extra insight into the making of a 'monster'.

Aileen Wuornos starting ""hooking"" by the time she was 13...I've seen many doumentaries and read many to attest to this. How Patty Jenkins can turn someone like that into a victim, is beyond me. Charlize Theron's preformance is brillant, it's the one saving point of the film. If you're going to tell the world about someone's life...be objective...don't put your own personal thoughts and feelings into the mix. Don't base the storytelling on your personal thoughts and feelings. Patty Jenkins should have been more objective...she shouldn't have tried to get the audience to feel sorry for Aileen. She should have portrayed the Aileen for what she was..a sick twisted, human being who refused to be accountable for her actions and tried to paint herself as a victim in a pathetic attempt not to have to pay for her crimes.",1091145600,2,923,4.811320754716981

 Having studied Aileen Wournos a bit in school, I came to the conclusion that she was a sick piece of trash, conjured up from some sewer. This film did not change my opinion of her, but it did succeed, however in painting a poignant picture of a human being transforming into a complete monster. To some it may seem that the makers of this are trying to convince the viewer that Wournos was a victim of circumstance, had no choice, but I don't think that is the case. The facts concerning Aileen's rampage of terror are portrayed with accuracy, her personality is captured by the brilliant Charlize Therzon. It is as if the viewer were a member of the jury, walking along with Aileen, being presented with the story firsthand, without the lawyers bickering back and forth, and not having to worry about undue sympathy being evoked.

 If this movie had been some feminist war-cry, then I, being the sentimental sucker that I am, most likely would have been convinced that Ailleen was misunderstood, etc. But that was not the case. I think that monster got exactly what she deserved (along with her first victim). To sum it up: Great Film!",1090886400,5,1345,4.591666666666667

You can see that even though Aileen did some horrible horrible things, she was still human, still a person just making a last attempt for love.  Christina Ricci also did a great job as Selby, the phone call scene will stick with me for the rest of my life, it was almost physically painful to watch.  The movie was very disturbing at times, and i had to fast foword through the rape scene, but it just pulls at your heart without making Aileen into any sort of hero.

Christina Ricci with her big expressive eyes portray the innocence of Selby, Aileen's lesbian girlfriend.
The movie is very disturbing and sad especially when you think prostitution like this happens everyday to women who probably have similar stories.  There are no uplifting moments.  No ""win"" at the end of the movie.
The take home message is trust your kids, love your kids, and ask yourself if the disagreement that you have is worth disowning your child and have the potential for their life to end really really bad.

1518788,5,B00005JMUK,"Wow......
Charlize Theron is brilliant in this film with her portrayal of ""serial killer"" Aileen Wuornos. Theron not only manages to completely change her looks but her entire persona, she becomes Wuornos, capturing all of the mannerisms and deep bedded anger that Wuornos exhibited during her trial. Theron's acting is fantastic and through her performance many questions are raised, some that will stay with you for awhile.
Christina Ricci should not be ignored in her performance in this film either. She captures naive innocence in her role as Wuornos's girlfriend. Ricci's emotions are raw and she holds her own against Theron's brilliance.
But this film is really more than just the acting; it is a statement about right and wrong and about the justice of our death penalty. I don't think anyone can walk away from this film and not feel that Wuornos might have deserved a different sentence. While I agree she was wrong to kill her victims I have to wonder what any normal woman might do under her circumstances. Rape is almost as brutal as death despite the lack of permanence. After seeing the life Wuornos had to live I became wracked with compassion for a woman with no place to turn. Was she right to kill? No! But at what point is a person a cold blooded murderer and at what point is she crushed by her circumstances. At some point blame needs to rest with the child abusers, rapists and sexual predators that helped to create Wuornos and others likely to come in her wake. This film will really cause you to reflect on where you stand on issues like this.",1090195200,25,1570,4.692028985507246

1518790,4,B00005JMUK,"Charlize Theron gives a five star+ performance as the executed serial killer Aileen Wuornos, the monster in ""Monster."" I would have rated the movie the same, except it is just too filled with pain, desperation and hopelessness for me to rank it that high. The script is not particularly strong. We only get a glimpse into the life and mind of this woman, and we never discover what made her kill. Many abused women hate men, but they don't become serial killers. There is also a lot of repetition, as Wuornos goes through her pattern of solicitation, violence and anguish over and over again. Without Ms. Theron's magnificent acting the film would be rather mediocre.
Director Patty Jenkins begins Wuornos' story in 1989-90, just before she was caught and imprisoned. She portrays Aileen more as a victim than as a victimizer. Through an initial monologue and various dialogues the viewer learns of Aileen's very troubled childhood in Michican. Her father, a convicted child-molester, committed suicide. Aileen was raped repeatedly by a family friend, and she began prostituting herself when she was thirteen. Her only job had been as a hooker. I think Ms. Theron portrays Aileen as a woman suffering from serious mental illness. Her moods swing from suicidal depression to euphoric overconfidence. She had delusional periods where she believed that all her dreams would come true and that she was invincible. She is a tough talking lady who drinks too much and barely holds her rage beneath the surface.
It is during this period that she meets Selby (Christina Ricci is superb in this role.), a shy, naive teen, in a bar. Selby is a lesbian who wants to come out of the closet against her family's wishes. She is a misfit, without friends. So is Aileen. At first the two are so thrilled that they like each other - that they are not alone anymore. Their desperate, mutual quest for affection culminates in this doomed relationship. To me the relationship is more about loneliness and emotional dependency than physical attraction. The honeymoon is short-lived, however. Selby had never been on her own before and for some reason, doesn't think to get a job. She expects Aileen to provide for them. She manipulates Aileen into continuing to work as a prostitute, even though she is aware of at least one murder. Jenkins suggests that as long as the money keeps coming in she will ask no questions. Wuornos tries to get work and go straight but has no job skills or experience. She winds up going back on the road as a prostitute again, and then, after a violent episode with a john, her rage takes over and the murders begin.
Charlize Theron does give an extraordinarily powerful performance as the serial killer. It is amazing how she was able to literally transform herself into a woman who looks exactly like the actual Aileen Wuornos, mannerisms and all. This transformation is not just make-up. She speaks like Wuornos, walks like her, with a masculine swagger, captures her intensity, and her eyes often hold a glint of madness.
The film is shot in a gritty style on the highway, streets, bars and motel rooms. The ambiance is pure sleaze, reflecting the true crime drama. Overall, the story is fascinating, as is the point of view. And, as I have said, the performances are simply excellent. Highly recommended!

1518810,5,B00005JMUK,"Charlize Theron is simply amazing in this engrossing, fact-based thriller. She is extremely convincing as serial killer Aileen Wuornos, giving a haunting and well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance. The otherwise gorgeous star transforms into the not so gorgeous killer and gives a very eerie and sympathetic performance. I was wowed.
Charlize Theron may rule the film, but the always wonderful Christina Ricci is very good as well, playing her love interest Selby. She brings an immature vulnerability and wide-eyed innocence to her character and pulls a real person out of what could be just a ball of insecurities.
This is not a movie that is easy to sit through; it is dark, ugly, and violent. An early scene in which Aileen is raped is almost traumatizing at best, it is so lacking in any form of humanity. In another scene, a too-far-gone Aileen comes across an elderly gentleman who is genuinely willing to help the woman, but that isn't something that Aileen is prepared to deal with if it comes from a man. His needless death is an eye-opening turning point to the film, when it really sinks in that this woman is hopelessly lost and can probably never be found.
Fair warning: this is a dark, harshly severe movie with no relief until the house lights come up, but if you can disconnect yourself from the onscreen horrors for a few moments, you'll see a story of humanity's worst nightmare: individuals cast aside with no ability to crawl out of the hole into which they've been thrown. There is certainly a message here that needs to be heard, and this movie is one that should be seen. I highly recommend it to those with an open mind, but it is definitely not for the squeamish.

1518811,4,B00005JMUK,"A film by Patty Jenkins
Roger Ebert listed ""Monster"" as the best film of all of 2003.  Charlize Theron won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  For months before the Oscars the talk had been about how amazing Theron's performance was and how not only was it the best performance of the year, it was one of the best performances in years.  This is a lot of high praise that raised my expectations on exactly what it was that I was going to see in ""Monster"".
""Monster"" is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos.  Aileen lived as a prostitute in Florida and became a serial murderer, killing her prospective clients.  As the film opens, Aileen is sitting under an overpass and is reflecting back on past events, specifically her meeting of Selby (Christina Ricci).  After meeting Selby in a bar, Selby quickly becomes Aileen's best (and only) friend and also her lover.  They are both very lonely and needy people.  For the love of Selby, Aileen wants to clean up her life, quit hooking, and find a real job so she can support Selby.  Unfortunately for Aileen, she is unable to find a job because she has no work experience, no resume, and a huge chip on her shoulder that prevents anyone in a position to help to even want to help her.  Selby is demanding, telling Aileen that she needs to start hooking again because they don't have any money, she is hungry, and this is one thing that Aileen can do to support her.
When she is raped by one of her clients, Aileen finally snaps and kills him.  She tells Selby that this was a one time thing, but after this first murder she starts killing and robbing her other clients.  It is at this point where we start to see Aileen crack under the pressure of what her life has become.  She feels that from day one she never stood a chance.  She was sexually abused as a child and by age 13 was pregnant and a prostitute.  This is her life and she has no opportunity to improve her life.  Her experience trying to find a legitimate job is proof of this.  ""Monster"" is the story of Aileen Wuornos and it is brutal and unflinching.
It is impossible to separate the performance of Charlize Theron from the rest of the movie.  ""Monster"" is built on the raw power and pain of Theron's transformation into Aileen Wuornos.  This transformation was both physical and emotional.  Charlize Theron is a strikingly beautiful woman and early in her career the roles she became known for were little more than the beautiful wife/girlfriend/woman (Legend of Bagger Vance, The Devil's Advocate, The Cider House Rules).  ""Monster"" required a physical change in the appearance of Theron's face and the make-up helped change the beautiful Theron into the ugly Wuornos.  The other part of the transformation is that Wuornos was a tormented, pained, and angry woman and this required Theron to not simply be a woman acting but rather to ""become"" Aileen Wuornos.  She succeeds.
During the first half of the movie I could not figure out why Theron had won the Academy Award for Best Actress.  She had become Aileen, but the performance was nothing terribly impressive for the first fifty minutes.  But when Selby confronts Aileen to return to being a prostitute, that scene nailed it for me and brought Theron's performance to an entirely new level.  The raw emotion Theron conveyed carried the movie.  The performance became more emotional, angry, vulnerable, fearful, and edgy and at no point did I think that this was Theron acting.  I saw Aileen Wuornos.
The movie itself, without Charlize Theron, did not feel to me that it was telling a story that could not have been told on a made for cable (because of the content) movie.  But the movie is not so much about the plot and about the story, but rather about the performance and transformation of Charlize Theron into Aileen Wuornos.  The performance makes the viewer capable of feeling pity for Aileen without excusing her actions.  I don't feel that there is any question that Theron deserved the Oscar for ""Monster"".

1518813,5,B00005JMUK,"This is one of the most talked-about movies of the past few years. Sometimes when so many great things are said about a movie, it can't help but fall short when you actually watch it. Everything you've heard about this movie is true. Charlize Theron gives an excellent performance. Much has been made of her physical appearance in the movie, but I think the real achievement is the psychological transformation she underwent. She nails what this person really was: a product of her environment. Aileen's hopes and dreams were what every person wanted: success, fame, and true love. Her life was crap, and watching this movie, you can't help but feel sorry for her.
The great thing about this movie is that it gets you to feel sorry for her without glorifying her crimes. She does many horrible things, and although she may have been abused as a child, her crimes were brutal and horrifying nonetheless. The fact that the movie really makes you see who this person really was- victim, dreamer, murderer- is what makes it a must-see. You see a real human being, not some cartoonish villain who runs around killing people.
First and foremost, this is a love story. I really cared for Aileen and Selby as a couple, and that is what makes the ending so heartbreaking. You see all sides of the story and that isn't something all movies can pull off. What I also liked was that the relationship didn't seem gimmicky. When they kissed, it wasn't like ""Oh, 2 girls kissing!"". It was about seeing 2 people connect in such an incredible way.
I also think Christina Ricci did an underappreciated job as Selby. She just wanted to find happiness and saw the beauty in a woman who had had a crappy life. She may seem a little annoying in some parts of the movie, but I think it fits the part. Selby got caught up in this whirlwind of events and tried to deal with it as best as she could because she really did love Aileen.
As for the DVD itself, there aren't many extras, but they are worth watching. There is an interview with writer/director Patty Jenkins and composer BT on how the score on this movie is essential to the impact this movie gives you. It is a little dull at times but it's ultimately insightful. There is also a featurette that shows how deeply Patty Jenkins and Charlize Theron invested themselves in this project. You also see that the movie was filmed on location in the actual places Aileen was at during this time in her life. You also learn that some of the extras in the movie were really there while all this happened. For instance, the bartender in the movie is the actual bartender who works at the bar Aileen frequented and actually knew her. There is also a film mixing demo that shows how elements like dialogue, music, and sound effects are woven to create a scene.
I am glad I saw this movie. It is one that will stay with you long after you watch it. If you haven't yet watched this yet, then you should do so. It is disturbing, but it really makes you think. It's not a movie I will soon forget, that's for sure.",1089936000,,3034,4.478339350180505

I knew to expect a lot of blood, sexual stuff, and a ton of emotions, but I was looking more for something of a TV movie nature.  However, I will not take away from this movie's many cinematic achievements.  It is a bold drama that takes many risks in the movie business--the casting of a beautiful starlet (Charlize Theron) as a murderous prostitute, the shooting of realistic love scenes between two straight actresses, and the list goes on....
The result is a twisting, turning, story with unbelievable outcomes.  Since it is based on actual events, ""Monster""'s negative portrayal of the sex trade is that much more astounding.  For many viewers, this may be a ""reality check""-type glimpse into the often-glamorized world of prostitution.  Instead of bling-blinging and living a high life, Theron's character, Lee, resorts herself to ""bathing"" in public restrooms and stealing money and cars.

Aileen Wuornos was a sad and pathetic creature whose past made her into what she became and Charlize Theron brings every complex dimension of her completely to life again in this film.  It wasn't just the makeup and added pounds that made Theron into Wuornos but her uncannily accurate portrayal of the woman who was lost between the horror of her personal life and the dreams she had to be somebody more than her circumstances dictated. Theron almost seems to be inhabited by the soul of Aileen Wuornos with every word, body movement and tormented and crazed wide-eyed look.  Her performance certainly deserved the Best Actress Oscar for this role and possibly of the decade. The music by BT adds another suitably eerie dimension to the film but it is really Theron's performance of the wonderful screenplay that makes this a 5-star film.
There's really not any gore to speak of, but the raw and bottom-line truth of Wuornos' life is what makes the story nearly unpalatable. Guaranteed, this movie will sicken, frighten, sadden and make you squirm.  If it doesn't, you should check to see if you still have a pulse.

On the story level, it is amazing to watch a street prostitute like Wuornos go from victim to killer.  At the beginning of the film she is brutally raped and forced to kill to save herself.  By the end of the movie, she is the killer, preying on innocent men with no lecherous intent.  This is a stunning story to view.

And there is no way of knowing about the details of the relationship between Aileen Wuomos and her young lesbian girlfriend Selby, played by Christina Ricci.  But it doesn't really matter because, due to the excellent writing and directing by Patty Jenkins, the characters come across as very real and very human.

Charlize Theron is cast as Aileen in a performance that won her an Academy Award.  Whoever did her makeup should get an award too.  All her glamour and ""babe-like"" qualities are hidden.  And what comes out is the true actor inside of her in every sense of the word.  Every gesture, every expression on her face and every bit of anger and pain come through as authentic and real.  She's totally believable as the deeply troubled woman, damaged by life.  She's desperate for love and a little bit of happiness.  But she hasn't a chance.  When one of her customers seriously mistreats her, she kills him in self-defense.  After that she just keeps killing.

As I recently saw the documentary about her life just a few days ago, I couldn't help comparing the films. Both were excellent.

If I had known how powerful her performance was going to be, I would not have gone.
Charlize Therone so intensely captured the feelings of abandonment by family and friends over and over, of doing anything to get love, of looking for love in all the wrong places, of wanting people to know she really just wanted to be a good person but something beyond her control caused her to act out. I understand those  feelings. Unlike me, Charlize didn't get therapy; that wasn't what they did in her neighborhood. The rejection she received when her attempts at getting help didn't work hurt her to the core so she soon stopped trying. Again, I understand how deeply it hurts when rejection is commonplace.
Charlize even caught the emotion of forgiving Ty for betraying her in the court room. She still loved Ty after the deception.

Charlize Theron's performance cuts right down to the bone from her portrayal of Aileen's last ditch effort and lifelong quest for love, fortune, and fame.  The film addresses Aileen's childhood trials, her longings, her unrealistic goals, her disappointments, her crimes, and ultimately, her execution.
Charlize transforms herself into Aileen and has the uncanny ability to talk, walk and has Aileen's physical expressions down pat. You literally forget that you are watching the same beautiful, Charlize from ""Cider House Rules"".
However, what this film does NOT address is the majority of the true story of Aileen Wuornos' lifelong criminal past, her numerous arrests, a rap sheet a mile long and finally the trial & unfortunate execution of Ms. Wuornos as we know it.
That being said, overall, this film really moved me. The feeling of hopelessness and helplessness was overwhelming at times.
Seeing Aileen FINALLY finding love and happiness with Selby, trying to clean up her act & trying to be a productive citizen, whatever miserable attempts were made by her, they WERE made, nonetheless. I really believe that once she found Selby she tried to leave the life she had known for something better.  It's just that she didn't even know WHERE to find it.
Aileen was a mentally sick human being in need of something SHE wasn't even aware of. A product of the world and of the system that so many children and adults fall in. After Aileen's rape and the first killing (self defense, no doubt) she really ""snapped"".  That incident, above all others, was indeed the straw that broke the camel's back.  Aileen KNEW that she was doing wrong after the second killing.  She even handpicked her victims.  It certainly wasn't ""random"" nor self-defense in every killing. In one scene with a sweet, stuttering ""John"" (played by ""Heavy"" star, Pruitt Taylor Vince)Aileen chooses NOT to kill because she feels compassion for him.
The true story of Aileen Wuornos is a depressing one, that's for sure but it will make you think about the world that we live in.
Included on the DVD is a short featurette.  Not much information on the complete story of Aileen as you can tell the director wanted to make this film a compassionate one. Thus, the film is a biased tale, but a great tale, nonetheless with a groundbreaking performance by Theron.

1518864,5,B00005JMUK,"Theron did an awesome job first off. Secondly, though, this movie is mind blowing. It is unfortunate that the woman Aileen went through all that pain as a child, and had that demented way to see things. I actually felt sorry for her for a while, when she was killing the first few guys. But damn it all to hell when she killed last guy. He wasn't even down for no sex. It was just a bad move. I could see killing the rapist, and the guy she thought was a child molester. But everyone else is a little much. Either way, Theron deserved her Best Actress Award and the movie should have been the winner for Best Picture. Definately a must-see",1089158400,2,639,4.245901639344262
1518865,5,B00005JMUK,"I watched Monster without any expectations, save knowing that it was a movie about two women. At the end of the screening, i was totally blown away. One, Charlize Theron gives a spectacular performance as 'serial killer' Aileen Wuornos. Her facial expressions and bodily movements strongly resemble that of the actual person (based on what i read). Secondly, the 'human' aspect of Aileen was brought out in the film, and despite her brutal killings, one can symphatise with aspects of her life which brought her to this point of no return when she started killing her johns. Thirdly, although Monster is primarily about Aileen the killer, yet the viewer is treated to a love story between Aileen and her lesbian lover. This is in many aspects, the driving force of the film and which makes the film memorable. Some prison psychologists had diagnosed Aileen as having Borderline personality disorder, which explains her behaviour of wanting to keep Selby Wall, her girlfriend (in real life, the girl's name is Tyria Moore) at all costs, despite the fact that Selby was at times a selfish, immature person who ultimately betrayed Aileen. The final scene of the 'confession' phone call (which basically nailed it for Aileen) is heartbreaking. Aileen basically took the fall for everything and absolved Selby of any blame. Even though the audience may sense a taste of Hollywood drama here, one must remember that in real life, Aileen did take the blame for everything, and even went to the extent of sending Tyria money while she was on death row. Perhaps this is a glimpse into a rare aspect of her life (which traditional documentaries on her never cover), which shows us that at the end of the day, she is a human being like the rest of us and despite her heinous crimes, she too longed to be loved and feel love. The betrayal scene will stick in my mind for a long time to come. I welcome emails on this film as i am interested to know more about the film as well as Aileen and her lover",1089072000,2,1988,4.682857142857143
1518866,4,B00005JMUK,"Despite the harsh judgment implied in the film's title - ""Monster""- Charlize Theron accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of turning a convicted serial killer into a sympathetic figure with whom we can identify and relate.  Aileen Wuomos, a hooker in the 1980's, was executed in Florida in 2002 for the premeditated murders of half a dozen or so unsuspecting ""johns"" with whom she came in contact.
Writer/director Patty Jenkins sees Aileen more as a victim than as a perpetrator, an individual more sinned against than sinning.  We are told, from the outset, that Aileen grew up, like all of us, yearning for the good things in life: stability, love, a bit of fame, fun and fortune if they happened to come her way.  Unfortunately, due to an abusive and troubled family life, she ended up selling her body at the tender age of thirteen.  When we first encounter her in her 20's, Aileen is a beat up, down-on-her-luck prostitute with barely a penny to her name.  Lonely and desperate for companionship, she wanders into a gay bar one night and meets up with a shy young lesbian named Selby who is, herself, just looking for someone to connect with and talk to.  Though Aileen claims to be straight, she finds herself drawn to the genuine niceness and warmth emanating from Selby.  A tender relationship develops between the two, with Aileen believing she has finally found a person whom she can truly love and who will reciprocate that love.  Feeling herself on the road to better things, Aileen even attempts to give up prostitution and get a ""real"" job, but the legit world is a far from welcoming place for an untrained, uneducated woman whose social skills leave much to be desired.  Desperate to get money to support the two of them, Aileen returns to hooking.  When one of her johns rapes her in the woods, Aileen shoots him dead and steals his car.  The success of this endeavor leads Aileen to kill a succession of men whom she deems, for the most part, to be morally bankrupt, psychologically abusive scum.  It's when Selby discovers what Aileen is up to that the real trouble begins.
Theron won an Oscar for her performance in this film, a complex piece of work that goes far beyond the surface aspects of the much-publicized changed appearance she underwent to approximate the bruised-up look of the actual Aileen.  Even without the de-glamorizing makeup job, Theron is in total command of the screen from first moment to last, showing us the multi-faceted nature of this hurting, troubled woman.  Christina Ricci, in a much less showy role, is equally impressive as Selby, providing an understated contrast to her far more flamboyant companion.  Together, these two fine actresses explore the complexities of both their characters and the relationship between them.  In a way, the film is really a love story between two lonely, troubled people who express that love in the only ways they know how.  Aileen goes on a murder spree to provide ""her girl"" with the comforts and necessities of life, while Selby, though at first disturbed by Aileen's homicidal tendencies, manages to come around to Aileen's way of thinking, knowing full well the grim alternative of a life lived unwanted and unloved.  There's an undercurrent of macabre humor flowing through the film as we watch Aileen heading out the door to kill another victim and steal another car every time the girls run a little short on spending money.  The nice thing about ""Monster"" is that we can't always sort out our feelings about these two women.  They both have characteristics that we simultaneously abhor and admire.  Aileen, despite the horrible acts of violence she commits, does appear to have a conscience of sorts, occasionally sparing a potential victim whom she believes doesn't ""deserve"" the fate she has mapped out for him.  Unlike Hannibal Lecter, Aileen does not murder out of madness, but rather out of practical necessity.  This makes her both easier and harder to identify with and understand than the average serial killer.  Selby, likewise, is a woman inexperienced in the ways of love who discovers that the person with whom she is trying to forge her first romantic relationship may, indeed, be a bit more than she bargained for.
""Monster,"" though it isn't afraid to deal with the complexities of its characters and situations, sometimes feels a bit too one-sided in its presentation, a bit too sanitized and nonjudgmental for its own good.  Maybe because Aileen's victims tend to be pretty much ethical scumbags to begin with, it becomes easy for us to detach ourselves from what we are seeing and to overlook the horrendous moral implications of the acts she's committing.  Perhaps, Theron is a bit TOO successful at making her character sympathetic, of letting her off the hook a mite too easily.  That, in a lot of ways, may be the single most disturbing aspect of the film - that we in the audience don't feel more anger and outrage at the things she's doing.  That effect might be the result of either hidden genius or inadequate development on the part of the filmmaker.  Who knows, perhaps the title of the film is actually meant to be ironic.  I'll leave that up to you to decide.",1088985600,3,5188,4.822799097065463
1518867,5,B00005JMUK,"To be honest, I didn't think much of Theron (she always seemed to be just a pretty face in Italian Job etc), but this performance completely blew me away.  Her transformation into Wuornos (both physically, the makeup is crazy, and emotionally) is completely believable without seeming like over acting or fake.
But be warned, this movie does not hold back.  Admittedly, the violence is appropriate, and the movie would not have the powerful effect it does without it, but if this sort of thing makes you uncomfortable then you'd be best to avoid it.

Based on the true story of Florida serial killer, Aileen Wournos,'Monster', takes you into what goes on in the life of a serial killer.  Theron's portrayal is remarkable. Christina Ricci, certainly has come a long way from 'Casper', while she plays Aileen's lesbian lover.  However, as dramatic and different this role may have been for Ricci, she could've done it a little better.  The role was obviously challenging for Theron, as seen in the DVD extra featurette.  Theron put her heart in soul in this film and the Oscar was given to the right actress!  For some people,the language and sexuality of the film maybe hard to take in at first.  It definately takes and open-minded and mature person to be able to watch and appreciate this film.  Intense and memorable.

What you have here is basically a movie with where profanity and sex replaces the story. But that's what Hollywood does when it doesn't  have a decent script: replace it with special effects or cuss all night long. It's as if pre-pubescent teens were in charge of making this movie. On the positive side, Charlize Theron can act. And from what I've heard, it didn't take much makeup to make her look like she does in this movie.
I kept shutting the DVD player off throughout this movie. At one point I shut it off to watch the news.  Then I was fast forwarding a lot. Finally I gave up and just stopped watching.
I was familiar with the true story behind this movie. So I was annoyed when the director had so much material to work with, and instead wound up with this mess. I remember the real serial killer once had sex with her brother and was kicked out of her house in her early teens. But you wouldn't know that from watching this thing.

1518891,5,B00005JMUK,"...aesthetically, this film was simply brilliant.
However, it was hard to watch Charlize Theron's character careen downhill for most of the last 2/3rds of the movie.  The parts where she tries to go straight and does job interviews are especially painful---I kept looking away from the TV screen because it was so painful to watch---really a testament to her phenomenal acting skills.
There is a raw emotional/spiritual violence going on here and perfectly captured on screen that is far far worse than anything I saw in ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Schindler's List""---it is the absolute horror and heartbreak of watching the total and relentless destruction of a human being despite all of her indomitable vitality and will.  This is what I imagine it'd be like to watch somebody being buried alive, you end up wishing for a mercy killing, that someone would at least be kind of enough to shoot her first.
It's safe to say that Charlize Theron earned her Oscar every bit of the way.
Christina Ricci also puts in a very strong performance as Lee's lesbian girlfriend...I don't know what their real-life sexual orientation is, but the scenes where the two women first make out outside of a roller rink are as dizzyingly passionate as any I've ever seen on film.",1088467200,2,1258,4.873831775700935
1518892,3,B00005JMUK,"We all know it. Charlize was probably one of the most typecast actors in all of Hollywood: the (...), the one who is lusted after. This doesn't make her a bad actor, but it doesn't show her at her best.
Charlize's performance as Aileen in 'Monster' definitely breaks all the barriers and wowed me numb. I couldn't believe that she was such a skilled actor that she could turn into something other than the vixen. I was stunned. I was flabbergasted. I was... there are no words.
I was also surprised by Christina Ricci's performance. She also totally became a character that doesn't seem to 'fit' her.
Despite these amazing performances, I must give the film three stars. Even though this was inspired by real-life events, I didn't find it incredibly interesting. It moved relatively slow, and I didn't like how Aileen showed almost no mercy. The killings seemed almost as unmotivated as they were random, so to speak.
Yet, I still feel that 'Monster' is a necessary film, mostly because if you didn't previously like Charlize Theron, you probably will after see this one.",1088467200,,1071,4.794594594594595

This movie was so very, very good, the acting was superb and it really made you feel what was in Aileen's heart and that even though she made men victims she was a victim too, from being raped and beaten from the age of 8,which is such a shame. Again like I have said people need to get some help.
Charlize Theron portrayed her perfectly and looked so much like her, I could not believe it. It was like Aileen was not executed, it was like she was starring as herself, from the way she laughed to the way she walked, Charlize had her down-packed; she really knew her character. I also learned that Aileen had an lesbian lover by the name of Selby which I neglected to find that out when I watch Death Row Prostitue on A & E or Court TV, which made the story more interesting and the reason she killed was to keep the love of Selby which she never got from anyone else especially her father because he didn't believe that she was raped by his bestfriend so he started beating her himself.

I now understand why she ended up at the electric chair. Monster is based on a true story of the first American woman serial killer. She killed seven men while she prostituted herself in Florida.  Aileen, who is played by Charlize Theron, was abuse by men since she can remember. She never had a decent relationship with a man; furthermore, no man has ever really loved her. She was always out looking for love and never found it. She never found a man to love her but she did found a woman to love her. Aileen fell in love with Selby Wall, played by Christina Ricci. The relationship between these two was awkward but they experienced attraction toward each other. They needed each other and a relationship flourished out of there need of love and acceptance. All she ever wanted was love and once she got it, she did everything to keep it even kill of it. Shelby Wall was selfish and was always asking for more. She never attempted to help Aileen; furthermore, she pushed her to prostitute herself so that they can eat. I was quite disappointed that the director did not spend more time on Aileen' childhood abuse. The director did a poor job showing the audience why Aileen turnout the way she did. Both the actresses did a great job portraying the life of Aileen Wuornos. The movie failed to show us the soul of Wournos.  She was not born a monster; our society turned her into one.",1088380800,2,1530,4.5398550724637685
1518895,3,B00005JMUK,"Oscar smiled on Charlize Theron.  And boy did she deserve it.  Her performance (aside from the much ballyhooed physical transformation) is the stuff legends are made of.  There isn't a moment that Theron isn't Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who murdered at least seven of her johns.  Charlize takes each movement, each emotion, each glance and makes Aileen a character you DO feel sorry for.
And for me, that's the problem with MONSTER.  Aileen certainly had a difficult upbringing, a youth full of abuse, of not being pretty, of not being loved.  But, ultimately, does that justify the lives she took?  Granted, her first kill could be considered as self-defense. But later she planned her murders, she solicited these johns knowing she would murder them, and doing it just so she could keep her little kewpie doll lover, Selby.  Director/writer Patty Jensen obviously stacked the deck in favor of Aileen, trying to manipulate her audience into accepting Aileen as the victim of her background, of men who used women, etc.  But what about the last victim she killed?  He wasn't even interested in her for sex, but she killed him anyway.  This is a heartless, self-centered, and certainly disturbed woman who demonstrated little remorse in the end.  MONSTER is a manipulative film, and one that tries to make light of Aileen's crimes.  It also portrays her lover as a selfish, self-centered young girl who couldn't face up to the fact that not only did she know what Aileen was doing, but encouraged her to continue doing it, just so she could get her house by the beach.  Serial killers are not role models, and although one can sympathize to a point, this movie whitewashes the facts with its unabashed bias for Aileen.
But, as a movie, one can't fault the performances.  Not only is Theron brilliant, but Christina Ricci does a fine job as Selby, even though her character ends up being as despicable as Aileen.
And while we're at it, why should we feel sorry for Aileen when she goes for a job interview at a law office without a resume?  Is this really true to life?  You don't get interviews for legal secretaries without a resume, and just because Aileen WANTED the job, why should she get it when she's not qualified?  This manipulation of facts by director Jensen is typical of the stacked deck of a movie.

But towards the end you don't know what to feel because she keeps killing innocent men. You still feel a little bit sympathetic for her even after what she has done, this film really makes you think about right and wrong and people in general. It makes you not so quick to judge others circumstances because you don't know what they are going through. All in all this is an excellant movie with great performances by all. Aileen finally has some recogniton. Wouldnt say its good recognition but it portrays her as more than a monster but also a human.

1518932,5,B00005JMUK,"Some reviewers of this movie felt that the film really didn't show us what makes Aileen Wuornos, the serial killer, tick. I beg to differ. Charlize Theron, in her outstanding job of acting, magnificently brings out the suffering, the loneliness, the despair of this unfortunate individual. Aileen comes from a dreary background (her mother abandons her, her father commits suicide, and she turns to prostitution in her early teens). The movie opens with Aileen contemplating suicide. Then she meets her future lover, Selby, in a bar, and becomes intoxicated with the type of friendship that has been denied her all of her life. She becomes alive, wanting nothing else but to hold on to her new lover, and make her happy.
She engages in a frenzied bout of hooking in order to get some cash to sustain her in this new relationship. A tragedy ensues in which Aileen kills a psychopathic john. Aileen continues to kill, mostly for the cash, and to have a car to get around in. In her desire to leave the life of a pro she tries to get a job to support herself and Selby. She doesn't have a clue about how to dress properly or interview for a job. The experience is frustrating and painful to her, and she sees, as do we, what a true outcast she is. She puts on a sour grapes bravado with Selby: who wants their stupid jobs anyway.
This carefully scripted movie leads the viewer to an understanding of Aileen, but does not promote sympathy for her. Her murders are too repellent for sympathy. Ms Theron is excellent in showing the frantic hopelessness of Aileen, who struggles desperately to hold her life together. She wants to live with Selby, have a job, and a house in the suburbs, but knows deep down under the macho front she tries to maintain, that her dreams will never be realized.
See inside Aileen? We see inside her with every wild wide eyed look; with every gesture; with every word she utters. Her anger, her walk, her desperation all show us a person who is totally outside society. There is no way she will ever fit in. We know it and she knows it.

Ms. Theron totally loses herself in the character of Aileen Wuornos, the serial killer who murdered seven men in Florida and was arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. Aileen Wuornos was finally executed in 2002, after spending many years on death row.
The film details the hard knocks life led by Aileen Wuornos, from that of a troubled teenager looking for love in all the wrong places to that of a hard living prostitute. It also looks at the very human side of Aileen Wuornos, a woman who found love in the person of a troubled, young lesbian in her late teens (Christina Ricci), who would ultimately betray the trust that Aileen Wuornos believed lay between her and her eventual fate.
Ms. Theron's physical transformation is startling, though I found her still recognizable as Charlize Theron. It is her performance, however, rather than her physical transformation,  that is more startling, as she infuses it with a high voltage intensity and swagger that bowls the viewer over. She makes the person of Aileen Wuornos come to life. She is a low rent individual,  white trash to the core, prostituting herself by getting into cars in order to have sex with total strangers. So, this film is not for the fastidious, as we are looking at the seamy underbelly of the beast in this film, and it sure isn't pretty. It is also a credit to Ms. Theron's compelling performance that the viewer is able to feel pity for Aileen Wuornos, a woman who is so vile, yet, at the same time, so vulnerable and pathetic.
The direction is excellent in the film, as are all the supporting performances. Christina Ricci is very good as the weak, passive,  troubled young woman with whom Aileen Wuornos enters into a lesbian love affair, a relationship which lasted years in real life rather than the short time depicted in the film. Ms. Ricci infuses the role with a certain amoral, vapid selfishness that makes the character's betrayal of Aileen Wuornos comprehensible. Bruce Dern, in the role of Thomas,  Aileen Wuornos' only true friend, is a stand out, as he adds depth to an otherwise small role. It is clear that Thomas saw something in Aileen Wuornos that the rest of the world missed. It is the most decent relationship that Aileen Wuornos appears to have had.
The film itself, despite the stellar performances, is somewhat flawed,  as it is unclear as to what made Aileen Wuornos tick, though it makes an attempt at deciphering her psyche. There are several theories that are exposed for the viewer to ponder: abused child, rape victim, and love sick puppet. They fall short of explaining adequately this  troubled woman who would go on to achieve such notoriety. Notwithstanding this unresolved issue, the film is still a compelling one, though not one I would necessarily care to view again, as there is nothing at all uplifting about the disturbing and sordid life led by Aileen Wuornos. Consequently, I consider this film to be a one shot deal, despite the wonderful performances.",1087257600,9,3107,4.875
1518976,5,B00005JMUK,"Monster is one of the only movies, (if not the only) that not once did I see the lead actress.  Instead for the entire film you are emmersed and witnessing a character come to life.  Not just because of the intense prostetics Charlize Theron had to wear but instead the startling performance she gives.
Monster is the true story of the only known woman serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Ive seen many documentaries on this woman and every one portrays her as a cold blooded killer, the movie though tells the whole story from her point of view.  On the verge of suicide, Aileen meets her soul mate Selby, played by Christina Ricci in the performance of her career.  You see that Aileen wasn't just a murder who did for some sick unknown reason, but that she feels she is on a mission to rid the world of all skummy men who take advantage of woman.
The most heartbreaking, and heart warming moments of the film are when Aileen decides to not prostitute herslef anymore, and go clean.  You see the hope she has for a real life with the love of her life at her side.  There are a number of very violent and graphic seens in this movie, which only adds to the dramatic tension.
Director Patty Jenkins, atempts a first in cinema history, by showing a serial killer as not a cold blooded murderer.  Instead she surprises you by actually caring for the characters and even finding them funny at times.  Imagine trying to do that with Charles Manson.  Most credit though belongs to Charlize Theron, who i must admit surprised at her talent.  Who knew she was capable of something like this?  She gives one of the best performances of all time, and also gives true meaning to deserving the Oscar.
DVD extras include a documentary on the film, with a few shots of the real Aileen in court.  It takes you through Charlize's day to day prostetic job.  Also includes theatrical trailers, and a few featurettes on the music, & score of the film.

She executes her johns in their cars with a .44 magnum. No this isn't a made for TV movie on the LifeTime Network for Women, this is Monster. The story of a real female serial killer from Daytona Beach.
Surprisingly little nudity in this, but a lot of sexual undercurrents. Aileen is clearly a little loopy to begin with, but being hit unconscious and tied to a car door and then being sodomized by a wooden stake throws her over the edge. Her naive 'partner' gets caught up in the murder and mayhem, and by chance is responsible for Aileen's arrest. A chance turn taken too fast throws them into the front yard of an elderly couple who fingers them later and gets their pictures on the TV.
The actors were all brilliant in this, not just the star and her partner, but the johns were cool too. You got the retarded type guy who's life is spared and gets a handjob to boot. Then you got the Good Samaritan who tries to help her, but is executed on his knees.

as I was saying they compare her performance to Halle Barrys of

Needless to say we were shocked when we found out that our search was for 2 women. This case was personal to me because one of the men she killed was a friend of mine. He didn't the pattern after the type of men Aileen Wuornos was killing, but at that point when she killed him it wasn't about sex, but the need of money. I am very please that the movie showed that he was only trying to help her out just as he did many other strangers.
Charlize Theron's performance was excellent,and a carbon copy of Wuornos, the attitude and personality were a match.
I strongly believe that Wuornos had been crying out for help to deaf ears her whole life, all she wanted was someone to care about her. And yet all she ever knew was violence and abuse, so she snapped, and then there was no turning back after she killed the first man who violently raped her. Set in her mind all that any man wanted from her was sex, she saw nothing else good about any man. Very sad, maybe this movie can be a lesson to anyone out there who may know someone like her who still has time to be helped before they snap.
 Christina Ricci also deserves to recive high credit for her role in the part of Wuornos lover, who in the end turned states evidence to have Wuornos convited of the murders. I strongly recommend this movie. Just don't let the kids watch it.",1086912000,119,1502,4.215277777777778

One would think that Theron took her que from Halle Berry in virtually BECOMING female serial killing prostitute Aileen Wuornos; in any event, she pulled off one of the greatest on-screen performances I have ever seen.  Just like Berry, Theron is a model-turned-actress and, just like Berry's outstanding performance in ""Monster's Ball,"" Theron's blisteringly brilliant turn as Wuornos shows that this South African beauty has titanium acting chops.

You know the story; We've all heard it before.  The little girl grows up to be a big girl and the abuse doesn't end, but the cycle continues and continues...
Then the prostitution, more beatings, more humiliation.
The little girl is still searching for love, still hoping for somebody to see who she really is, still holding on to a little thing called 'hope.'
Wuornos is that girl. And the viewer will love her and hate her at the same time, but mostly want to wrap their arms around her and scream...STOP!
Theron plays her to perfection--- The way her upper body swaggers, the way she swings her hair, how her teeth appear to large for her mouth, the masculine walk, and oh! let's not forget how she lifts that cigarrette to her unglossed mouth...cigarrette after cigarrette, inhaling and exhaling as if it's her last (maybe it was.)
My God, she was stunning.  The next best performance to Liz Taylor in Virginal Woolf!!!!!!

In fact, without Charlize Theron, Monster would be a B movie at best. But even as good as Theron is, there are moments where her mannerisms and characterizations remind me of Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice character.

1518985,5,B00005JMUK,"I don't think the Academy Awards people have had any trouble in choosing the winner for the best actress in a leading role, nor I think they took too much time to arrive at their decision,despite the other wonderful performances of the other nominees.
Anyone who watches Monster, and the mind blowing performance that is so gritty, real and totally involved and involving would not flinch for a second in presenting Charlize Theron with a truly deserved award!
The story itself, a biopic of infamous serial killer Aileen Wuornos, has been filmed before,(I don't think such a 'meaty' subject matter for a movie would had to wait till now to be filmed),but there is a difference..
For one, all credit should go to writer/director Patty Jenkins for her totally sympathetic and unsentimental treatment of the Wuornos story. She was more than capable of handling the complexity of emotions, with very visual as well as character based approach.
Although the story is told largely from Wuornos's point of view, the success that Jenkins manages to achieve is to win the viewer's sympathy for both killer and victims: there are no real monsters in Wuornos's story..just a very tragic life, a woman who has been abused for so long by family and 'customers' and neglected by society at large when she tried to 'go straight', pushing her back into the ending that she could not avoid.
And while the loss of lives of the innocent men she killed was totally inexcusable, the feeling I got from the film was that Aileen Wuornos was also dead long before she was executed.
A very powerful scene sees Wuornos in the back of a corrupt cop's car, allegedly booked for some complaint but picked up for sexual favors. She tries to pretend that she is having a day off from a normal 9 to 5 job,but then the cop revealing that he knows what she does for a living, replies sarcastically, do you go to church on your day off?
I find this scene extremely important because it shows how Wuornos tried to maintain her dignity as a human being but failed..very sad indeed.
The relationship between Aileen and Selby (played so well by Christina Ricci in one of the best roles so far) which is central to the whole story,was very well written. We know that Wuornos was not gay but someone who craved affection and love and (as she says in the film)can 'train' herself to love a woman to achieve a most desperate need to love and be loved.
I thought the love scenes were very well filmed, with enough passion between the two women, yet never gratuitous.
Now a word about the acting again..
Charlize Theron is not only one of the most beautiful women ever, but she is equally talented..She reminded me a bit of De Niro, Hoffman, Kidman or Streep, that kind of actor/actress who totally dedicates him/herself to his/her role, not only emotionally but physically as well..and had I not known she is playing the lead role, I would have been be excused even for few seconds for failing to recognize her..this is how great the physical transformation and likeness to the real Wuornos is. I would also like to mention that I real loved Pruitt Taylor Vince, one of the best actors in American Cinema today, and although his role was short, he as usual excelled.
So Monster is a real gem of a movie, a tragic story about the life of one woman who from early on had all the odds stacked against her, and at a moment of weakness unleashed demons that slowly took control of her, and had to pay dearly for it. A Must Buy!",1086652800,,3478,4.593247588424437
1519036,5,B00005JMUK,"Patty Jenkins' directorial and screenwriting debut is one heck of a start. She certainly has a future in Hollywood. But let's get down to the real heart of this film. The performance of Charlize Theron as America's first femal serial killer Aileen Wuornos is astonishing. It has been hailed as ""one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema."" And it truly is. Watching Theron in this movie is like watching a master's class in acting. This is truly what acting is all about. For not one second of this film, did I see Charlize Theron on the screen, I always saw her character. The utterly amazing and phenomenal transformation of Charlize Theron who is quite possibly the most beautiful woman alive into this gritty, disturbing, violent, and unkempt killer is something who any film buff must see. Theron's performance will never be forgotten, and will certainly go down as one the greatest ever. I must also pay tribute to the unsung hero of this film, Christina Ricci. Since Theron was so brilliant, Ricci took the backseat for this film. But it must be noted the Ricci gave a powerhouse performance, and held her own playing off Theron. As far as owning this film, I think it is worth owning. It must be said that this is not a movie that can be watched over and over. It is just way too disturbing and unsettling to watch many times. However I think it is worth owning to own the amazing performance of Theron. It is much like Adrian Brody in ""The Pianist"" These movies are worth owning for their truly brilliant acting, writing, and directing. Charlize Theron like Adrian Brody took home the Best Actress/Best Actor Oscar for her performance. And she so deserved it. Theron was also honored with the Golden Globe, and SAG (screen actor's guild) awards for ""Monster"" Make sure you catch this critically aclaimed, and truly brilliant film.

1519038,5,B00005JMUK,"When you think about a movie that is based on a serial killer, you could think ""how ordinary and overdone"". It is about a woman named  Aileen Wuornos who was a prostitue, and winds up committing several murders (note that I did not refer to her as a serial killer). What makes this story different though, is the road that takes her there. This movie illicited a response from me that I had not expected which was a tremendous amount of sympathy and pity. Her life started out incredibly difficult, and only got worse. Unlike the other notables (John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, et al) in my opinion she was not crazy and was more or less driven to do what she did. The first murder that she committed was a ""John"" that was brutally raping her, and had planned on killing her. That was the one that opened the flood gates of rage. The rest were the product of a lifetime of abuse from, and hatred of all of the other ""Johns"" previous. Only one that I saw could be considered oppertunistic, and towards the end she actually has difficulty killing one of her last victims. If you had never heard of Aileen Wuornos before, this one will make you never forget her name.
  Along those same lines, Charlize Theron's performance was easily the best in her career, and she will likely be immortalized for her protrayal - and rightly so. While normally a incredibly beautiful bombshell, she had to gain thirty pounds, and go through an amazing transformation with only make up. The only prosthetics were used were fake teeth. She winds up looking nothing like herself, which makes it very easy to forget that it's really her.
  Coming from a guy who owns more than 500 titles, I consider this to be one of the best that I own. If you want a supplement to this movie, also check out ""Aileen: Life and death of a serial killer"" which is a biography done by HBO and helps to answer several questions as well as fill in some blanks.",1086566400,2,1914,4.4415954415954415

What can be said about Charlize Theron's performance that hasn't already been said? Nothing, really. Suffice to say, a well deserved Oscar. I have never seen an actor completely disappear into a role like this. Ever. Theron was all the way gone. I have never seen a more convincing job.

1519099,5,B00005JMUK,"Charlize Theron's acting has us almost at the point where we *understand* Aileen's actions and why she did what she did, and we sympathize with her.  The rape scene brought me to tears.  As the movie goes on, you can find her becoming more and more desperate, and it's like you're watching the REAL Aileen Wuornous, not someone playing her on TV.  I can remember the entire media circus surrounding her trial and thinking to myself that she was nuts, but this movie really tells us the meanings behind her actions and what brought her to murder, and I find myself almost sympathetic.  I can't stress enough how great a job Charlize did at portraying her.
Oh, and finding out that the title ""Monster"" wasn't nearly what I thought it meant was neat too...",1086220800,2,753,4.597014925373134
1519100,3,B00005JMUK,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie. But from all the hype this movie has been getting, I thought it would've been better. The acting was awesome. The transformation in appearance Charlize made for this movie is just gruesome compared to her everyday look. The plot seemed kinda thin at times and dragged on. I was intrigued by this story and was somewhat disappointed though after watching the movie. I guess I expected more than a drama film, but I would recommend checking it out anyways.",1086220800,,496,4.712643678160919

1519102,4,B00005JMUK,"You don't gain much by watching a film like this, other than the fact you can realize your crappy life isn't really so bad after all. The performance by Charlize Theron is truly one of the best ever on film by an actress. I had know idea she could act until I saw this brutal portrayal of this killer with my own eyes. She deserved her Oscar easily. I also thought Christina Ricci was very good too as Selby, her sidekick and partner. Rent this movie and watch it once. It is well made, but I doubt many can stomach this fairly disturbing film more than a couple of times. And who would want to?",1086134400,,595,4.182608695652174
1519103,5,B00005JMUK,"A brilliant portrayal of what we'd rather not know. It's a story of the betrayal of one woman. Raped, abused, falling into a world of fantasy and prostitution, she fights for her single chance at a happy life in the only way she knows. This is one of those wonderful films that show us our own judgmentalism. How many are of us are so content to look at the unfortunates around us and feel a buzz of moral superiority because we aren't there? The film pointedly shows us how unfortunates become unfortunates. I was deeply moved.",1086134400,4,528,4.510416666666667
1519104,5,B00005JMUK,"The extraordinary achievement of this film about a prostitute who was a serial killer (all the more horrifying because the story is true) seemed to demand the vast reaches of the large theater screen to bring home all the grisly details of this story.  But now that the movie is on DVD and is available for viewing in the sanctity and privacy of the home, the real treasure of what Director Patty Jenkins has achieved comes home.  Aileen Wournos was a killer of her johns, yes, but seeing this biography on the small screen reveals more of the motivation that drove her to commit such acts.  Patty Jenkins has entrusted Charlize Theron with the power to explore Wournos' mind, and between the two of them we discover that the mental state of this killer was shaped by her childhood and her actual experiences while plying her business on the freeways.  She was an abused soul, not that that forgives her crimes, but that it makes them credibly motivated.  Christina Ricci as her lesbian lover Selby follows suit in holding the mood and motivation of this doomed woman.  An additional feature on the DVD is an excellent 'featurette' in which Patty Jenkins, Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci interact to explain how the film was made and why was such an exhausting mission for the entire company. Highly recommended film that tansfers to DVD extremely well.",1086134400,3,1357,4.777777777777778
1519105,5,B00005JMUK,"""Monster"" is one of the most talked about films of 2003, not just because of Charlize Theron's groundbreaking performance.  This is one of the most daring films released that year.  It desplicts the life of the first female serial killer in US history, Aileen Wuournos.  It explores the time between Wuournos moved to Florida to her meeting girlfriend Selby to her making her first killing to the conclusion.  The brilliant plot digs deeper than just a woman who kills.  It shows how she became so angry of life, influencing her murders.  Contrary to popular belief, the crew assures that they do not symphathize her murders.  The chain of events has the level of direct impact to keep audiences on the edge of their seats.  The powerful theme never fades for a moment throughout the film.
Charlize Theron's performance as Aileen Wuournos is one of the best in many years.  Film critic Leonard Maltin once said that this is the best performance in cinema history.  He may be correct.  There was never a year that any actress was as well-deserving of every Best Actress award in existance, including the Oscar and the Golden Globe.  Such acting quality goes beyond gaining thirty pounds and abandoning the Hollywood glamour for a while.  She almost literally became Wuournos.  Her facial expressions, her physical mannerisms, her vocal style, and her presence resemble the real-life Wuournos.  Therefore, she clearly researched her role thoroughly.  Theron never loses that presence for a moment.
Christina Ricci's underrated performance as Wuournos's girlfriend Selby is wonderful.  Her character's compassion and her anger is well expressed in the film.  Thought the role is not as demanding as Theron's, she still proves that she is a rare young talent.  All other actors present themselves wonderfully.
The physical surroundings, including the buildings and the make-up, greatly add to the gloomy film theme.  It wondefully desplicts Aileen Wuournos's extension to her life.  The make-up team wonderfully transformed Charlize Theron's face and skin into Wuournos's, making Theron resemble her much closer.  Such accomplishment also offers a deeper to Wuournos's painful past.
""Monster"" is an unforgettable experience for its audiences.  It is sure to please them for a long time.  The special features are great, interesting pieces that explore the film's production.  Those wanting to learn more about Aileen Wuournos should also read the book ""Deep Ends: The Pursuit, Conviction, And Execution of Female Serial Killer Aileen Wuournos, the Damsel of Death"" written by Michael Reynolds.",1086134400,2,2589,5.271393643031785

While we are horrified by Wuornos' slip into mindless slaughter we are MORE agonized by what happened to her. I think she is a latter day (not Mormon) saint. She sinned bigger than any medieval dude and found her way back, and then some, before execution. I was extremely impressed with the film.",1524268800,,443,4.842105263157895

7940381,5,B00005JMUK,"It broke my heart watching this. What tragic circumstances lead to a life like that. People will say..."" oh, there are thousands of children that are neglected and horrifically abused, and they don't become serial killers"". To me, that's like saying ""there are thousands of men and women that go to war, and they don't get PTSD"". We read and hear stories of child abuse. Child abuse of all kinds, even child murder, that is SO traumatic and depraved to US, that we will break down sobbing, and threaten what we would do to that person if we could get 5 minutes with them...that poor child. We have such sympathy and empathy. But what if that child grew up and murdered someone? THEN every one is outraged without truly understanding the mitigating circumstances. A child living that life, knows no other way...how could they? They have never seen it, felt it, learned it, or could even imagine it. I watch true crime court cases, and in one case of rape and murder of a child, the  Medical Examiner broke down while testifying about the child's injuries, and the court had to take a recess. I'm not talking about psychopaths
  , they're in a class of their own. I'm talking about psychological pain so deep in a brain, it's a darkness that rarely comes to light. I'm an RN,C and maybe I have more understanding of what people can become, because I have seen it all. I also believe in the death penalty, (so I'm not some sappy advocate for murderers), but ONLY for ""the worst of the worst"", and NOBODY should be executed if there is UNTESTED DNA. That actually happens!! Have I convinced anyone to have sympathy for her? I don't know how much of the movie was fiction ""for entertainment purposes"", but the part that broke my heart, was when she felt someone actually loved her. For the first time in her life. Can you even imagine? One tragic scene for me, was when she killed her very last victim. He was the most decent man she had ever met and didn't even recognize it when she saw it. Now, I'm going to watch the documentary again! I recommend ""Aileen: Life And Death Of A Serial Killer"".",1519776000,,2091,4.511873350923483
7940382,4,B00005JMUK,"I liked the movie overall. The thing I don't like, is how in real life her girlfriend was a butch lesbian, and in this movie, her girlfriend is real feminine and timid. It's an example of the erasure of any non feminine women in the media. And also, my belief is that all of the dates, after the one who tried to kill her, did attempt to rape her. And she did something that is a radical act for a prostitute, and defended herself. Most prostitutes know, if you kill a trick, the cops are always going to say it was a robbery gone bad, and arrest you, and then you sit in jail for two years on like a million dollars bond, and if you're lucky, you get found not guilty, and all you lose is 2 years of your life, or else you get life... or death. So, we are pretty passive about tricks robbing and raping us, as long as they aren't trying to kill us. I think after the guy actually tried to kill her, and she had that girlfriend to live for, she just got scared that every rapist, robber and creep was trying to kill her, and she defended herself. To me, this court case showed that prostitutes have no right to defend themselves in America.",1516924800,,1140,4.13963963963964
