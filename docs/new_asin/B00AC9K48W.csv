8549951,4,B00AC9K48W,"What a charming spotlight on an eccentric and endearing man.  Ive been to Chicago many times and enjoyed seeing familiar scenery in the movie.  Never heard of Vincent Falk before, but now Ill ask my Chicago friends.  It looks like a lot of detective work went into learning about this marginalized man who appears to be a staple tourist attraction.  Some interesting camera exposures.  Heartwarming story about how an outsider carved a place of welcome for himself putting smiles on peoples faces.",1525305600,,497,5.012195121951219
8549952,5,B00AC9K48W,"A sweet look into a quirky guy who just wants to be loved and make people feel good. At first glance, Vincent is an eccentric kook in bright colors who likes showing off. However, this documentary delves a bit deeper to see the path he took to get to be famous in Chicago for entertaining the passing boats and crowds and his never ending smile. This is a great reminder that differences help make the world a more vibrant place.",1525132800,,429,4.375
