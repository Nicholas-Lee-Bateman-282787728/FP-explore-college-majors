1506367,4,B00005JMAY,"While not as good as the first one, GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE 2 still made me laugh.  Director David Grossman keeps the cartoonish feel of the animated series and Christopher Showerman impersonates Brendan Fraser just fine.  His opening explanation for why Brendan isn't in the movie is funny; in fact, most of the ""narrative voiceovers"" by Keith Scott add a lot of fun to the film.  Julie Benz replaces Leslie Mann as Ursula, and she did a good job in playing the ""second banana"" to Showerman.  Christina Pickles is fun as Ursula's Mom and Thomas Haden Church must be baffled himself that he's an Oscar nominee considering his one-note performance in the two films, but he fits the role.  Voices of John Cleese and Michael Clarke Duncan add some fun as well.  Kids will love it, although there is some sexual innuendo and scatological overkill, but I admit they made me laugh...and that's what a silly film like GOTJ2 should do!",1109203200,,924,4.708074534161491
1506368,4,B00005JMAY,"George of the Jungle returns in this sequel to the hit 1997 movie. Only this came to video and dvd, and it is misses at least 2 people from the first film, but for some Thomas Halden Church returns in this movie, along with John Cleese and Keith Scott who provides the narrator's voice. But this time, Disney decided to take a live action movie, and make a sequel out of it, usually they do this with animated movies. As the movie opens, George of the Jungle (Christopher Showerman replacing Brendan Fraser). And now he is king of the jungle, and has to divide time for both the animals and his wife Ursula (Julie Benz) and son Junior (Angus T. Jones), and usually he ends up late for things for his family including lunch! But one day, George's mother-in-law Beatrice Stanhope (Christina Pickles) comes to the jungle for her grand son's birthday, and has secretly has plans, to return her daughter and her grand son to cvilian, and reunite Ursuala with her ex-fiance Lyle (Thomas Haden Church). While Lyle has plans win the deed for Ape Mountain, fro Ape (John Cleese) who is now in Las Vegas, during a poker game, Lyle hides in disquise, and plays, Ape, and cause him to go broke, and when Lyle suggests to play for the deed to Ape Moutnain, he reveles his doesn't have it, and that it belongs to George of the Jungle. And has serious debt, and has to work in a casino for 17 years. And when George learns that Ape is in trouble, he goes to Las Vegas to talk to Ape, becuase Geroge thinks that Ursuala is not happy in the jungle.",1085616000,,1531,4.394366197183099
1506369,1,B00005JMAY,"Everything about this production is 2nd rate-or worse.  Not only don't we have any of the important members of the original cast, we also don't get the writing, the pacing, or the production values-some of the animal characters appear to be done with plastic simulacrums!  This is really painful to look at-I got through about 30 minutes and I rarely turn off a film.  This isn't even good enough for afternoon television-junk cartoon fare.  I'm amazed Disney would release this piece of tripe under their banner.",1069113600,2,513,4.930232558139535
1506370,4,B00005JMAY,"George of the Jungle 2 was released by Walt Disney Home Video in 2003. This movie is in color and has a running time of 87 min. The director for this movie is David Grossman(third).
  Even without Brendan Fraser, Disney produced a funny movie the whole family can enjoy. In the beginning of the movie there were a couple of tongue in cheek references to Brendan Fraser's absence. Christopher Showerman is the new George of the Jungle and he proved he can be just as funny as Brendan Fraser was. Ursula, portrayed by Julie Benz, is confused as to whether she will ever become first in George's life. In turn George worries that Ursula isn't happy about living in the jungle. An opportunity to take Ursula and their son, portrayed by Angus T. Jones, to the states arises. This is a good family movie with various parodies.",1067817600,5,820,4.571428571428571
1506371,5,B00005JMAY,"What a hilarious film! The sexual innuendos are so over-the-top and fun that you hardly think you are watching a Disney movie.
Ursula: ""Honey, I wouldn't worry about Junior swinging...he's the son of the greatest swinger of all time. How could he not learn how to swing?""
All the actors are in great form (especially George's!). The uberfabulous Julie Benz (""Darla"" from ANGEL) appears as Ursula, George's wife (lucky broad) and Christina Pickles (""Sorceress"" from Masters of the Universe:The Movie) plays her evil mom! Christopher Showerman makes his debut as George, taking over for Brendan Fraser, as he explains. The Amazon review is correct, the camera does oogle his body but you'll get no complaints.",1067299200,2,707,5.156521739130435
1506372,5,B00005JMAY,"I think that this sequel was wonderful! George of the Jungle is a family favorite and my children and I thought sequel equally as good! I am a huge fan of Brendan fraser however I think that Christopher Showerman did an AWSOME job as ""new George""! He won our hearts! Two thumbs way up!!!!!!!!!",1066780800,2,293,4.444444444444445
1506373,1,B00005JMAY,"My husband and I just love the first movie, you can`t resist Brendan Frazer`s silly but charming playing without Brendan I expected a worse movie. but not this bad.... After a couple of scenes my husband leave the room, I just remain out of curiosity, how bad it could get? but it could... so don`t even bother , if you so curious about it just rent it and save money....",1066780800,4,371,4.314285714285714
1506374,1,B00005JMAY,"The first George of the Jungle was so silly, it was kind of cute and at times funny, helped by Brendan Frazer, this sequel, minus Frazer,is so silly it is actually unwatchable.
Any comedy whether silly or not should have an absolute minimum, to be funny, and George of the Jungle 2 is actually every word you can think of but the F word.
After 15 minutes of listening to the very annoying narrative talking about the old movie, the new movie, Disney etc...you want to give up watching movies altogether and watch CNN!!(this is how bad it is)
Even the delightfully charming and pretty Julie Benz could not save an awful direction and script.
If you like silly comedies,and want the F back in films then the market is full of well made and very funny examples, like Top Secret,Naked Gun, and the classic Carry On Up the Jungle (an all time favorite of mine), but trust me this film should be avoided at all costs!",1064966400,13,911,4.461077844311378
1506375,3,B00005JMAY,"Yes, it is a stupid movie but let's not forget that this was meant to be a stupid one. In that key it's pretty well done. Sure, don't watch it if you're in the mood for something deep and serious but if you just wish to spend some hour and half with no thinking or even laughing at sometimes, well, in this case it's OK. Most of kids love it indeed, as it was also for the previous part. And personally I liked half-naked Christopher Showerman as new George! :-)",1063324800,3,462,4.144444444444445

We were all disappointed all the ""stars"" of the original movie except Thomas Haden Church were gone as replaced with no-name actors.  Not that that is necessarily bad, it is just that they didn't have the charm or comedic timing as the original actors.  Also, the script wasn't as good as it just wasn't as funny or cute as the original movie.",1408665600,2,400,4.527777777777778

1506579,5,B00005JMAY,"Ok, everyne agrees that it was stupid and silly - but who cares? This is a movie to watch just for the fun of it and have a few good laughs when trying to relax. I enjoyed it just as much as the first ""George of the Jungle"" and actually felt my headache go away after a bad afternoon of argueing about computer problems with some friends. The new cast is just as good as the old one and just as funny. I was surprised to actually see Angus T. Jones from ""Two and a Half Men"" play George's son, he did a fine job. I didn't mind the narration at all - it added to the comedy and that is what the movie is all about - comedy. And Disney always knows how to present it. No, these kind of movies are not Oscar winners but once again - who cares? I know I don't. If you feel the same way I do - buy it. I bought both ""George 1 & 2"" together for under $12 on Amazon (cheaper than going to the movies), and each movie is on its own disc, not two-sided like some. Very enjoyable!",1355529600,,970,3.855
1506580,1,B00005JMAY,"I remember watching the GOTJ cartoon on Cartoon Network back in the 90s, and seeing the 1st George of the Jungle movie when I was 2 years old at the movies, it was the first film I saw in a theater and I laughed my ""coconuts"" off and sang the theme song when my parents drove me home.  After hearing that a sequel was in the works, I wasn't too enthusiastic and knew that it would be bad. The only good thing about this retched sequel was the opening animated cartoon opening, that's it! Like the title says, here's my pick of the top 10 worst sequels of all time:
1. George of the Jungle 2
2. Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House
3. Caddyshack 2
4. Speed 2: Cruise Control
5. Crocodile Dundee 2
6. Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles
7. Wayne's World 2
8. Shrek the 3rd
9. Stuart Little 3
10. Spider Man 3

Christopher Showerman was perfect and played the role to its maximum silliness.  I would recommend it for children five to 12 years old, then they will probably have to wait until they are adults to enjoy it again.",1349049600,,361,4.774193548387097

1506653,5,B00005JMAY,"George of the Jungle 2 is the 2003 Disney direct-to-DVD sequel to the hilarious 1998 orginal and based on the classic 1960's animated cartoon series. Christopher Showerman makes his film acting debut as the new George(replacing Brendan Fraser), also starring John Cleese(Fawlty Towers)as the voice of Ape, Michael Clark Duncan(Daredevil) as the voice of the Mean Lion, Julie Benz(Angel) as Ursula, a young Angus T. Jones(Two and a Half Men) as George Jr. and Thomas Haden Church(Spider-Man 3) as the evil Lyle. The film involves George, Ursula and George Jr. living peacefully in the jungle when word reaches to George that Ape has money troubles in Las Vegas and George, Shep and Tookie-Tookie heads to Nevada to help out. Meanwhile, Ursula's mom, Mrs. Stanhope(Christina Pickles)is devising a plan to get her daughter away from George with a little help from Lyle, and to make matters worse, there is an plan by the Mean Lion to overthrow George and make himself the new king. The special features includes deleted scenes, bloopers and a behind the scenes look of the film, as well as trailers for other Disney DVD favorites.

And he is funny,not a bad choice considering he is in the place that was of Brendan Fraser, a very versatil actor ,very talent one. I said to me when film started in Brazilian tv; hey this is not Brendan and a second later this was the first joke of this film .Not very special to see in theaters is as many movies a very good choice to see at home with all family.",1168387200,,482,4.366666666666666

1506659,2,B00005JMAY,This movie was a whole lot worse than the first one(I actually like the first one).  You can tell the animals are computer animated.  The actor that plays George is terrible!

1506660,4,B00005JMAY,"Lets face it, no one expects a cinamatic masterpiece with ""George of the Jungle"" either 1 0r 2. They are based on a dumb but funny cartoon. So those people who expect something terrific are handicaping themselves from having a good time. It is nothing more than a cartoon done with humans and some CGI. Face it, any film with a sarcastic narrator lets the audience know exactly what type of film they will be watching.

The cast is just fine. It doesn't matter that there are new actors for George and Ursala. They are both very good in the roles. Anyone expecting an Oscar winning performance needs serious therapy. Christopher Showerman gives life to the stilted dialogue and is a perfect George. To play it differently would be to deny the character. The dialogue is also a satiric take off on that of the Tarzan films - ""You Jane - me Tarzan"".

There are many ""inside"" jokes in the film. One very funny bit is that evil lion who wants to become King, is standing on a recreation of Pride Rock from ""Lion King"", the whole scene is a take off on that part of ""Lion King"". There are many other such items that make the film really fun for the adult with the ability to recognize them.

Not a ""great"" film, but certainly a fun 90 minutes.",1115510400,9,1238,4.397379912663755

7940252,4,B00005JMAY,"If you loved George of the Jungle (the first film) then you will probably enjoy this movie enough.  The biggest drawback to this film is that it does not star Brendan Fraser.  His replacement just comes off as a cheesy goofball.  Fraser's George was still goofy because that's the nature of the character and franchise but he manages to pull it off in likeable way.  This movie is okay as a family flick once or spaced out with a year or more between viewings but I think most adults would not want to re-watch it much.  My (at the time of viewing) 7 year old son loved it as much as the first, my 13 year old son said it was okay, and my 14 year old daughter thought it was tolerable but annoying... I think it's target market is 10 and under.  It's a sequel so I didn't have high standards for it but I felt it could have done better and really should have had Fraser reprise the role.  But it was still funny enough and had a moderately decent plot and okay acting that I would say it was okay.  I personally would say 3 stars but my 7 year old says 5 so I think it probably deserves 4 stars as an average between us.",1512950400,,1120,4.082191780821918
