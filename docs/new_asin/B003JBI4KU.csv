8397980,5,B003JBI4KU,"Having viewed nearly 30 instructional tennis videos in the past 25 years, this ranks in the top 6-7. It does contain some ""filler"" type information (for more experienced players), but still provides some very sound tips/strategies that can improve your game and help you win more matches. If you have a 5.0 rating or better, this would essentially be a waste of your time/money; but for players rated 4.5 or below (especially 2.5 to 4.0 players), you will never regret this purchase. I am a 4.5 rated senior and it definitely helped me beat a 5.0 rated player for the 1st time ever earlier this week. No kidding! It is also amusing to watch, and downright hilarious at times. All in all, a solid B+!",1379462400,,699,4.6

Agreed - there are some sections on equipment. Some you've seen, some you haven't. I would save this section for last, and dive right into the tennis strategies, because they are PURE Gold.

Here's an example. If you haven't seen Tom's lob trick, check it out here (it's the video about 3/4 down the page). It's short and to the point.

Here's the video: [...].

Being mid-summer, I used this thing just last week. Not only does it mess your opponent up for the particular shot, but he (or she) will be seeing spots for at least another point or 2. And if they're up to serve.. you can go ahead and take the next point to the bank.

These DVD's include MUST-HAVE information for club players. I don't care how advanced a person is, you'll walk away with more than a handful of gems you didn't have before, because each tip can not only be used AGAINST your opponent, but can also be used to improve your game.

For example.... Tom points out that you can frustrate the heck out of folks that use western forehand grips by hitting the ball at them low. They hit it in the net almost every time. Genius. But what's even better, there's 2 lessons here.

1) When Playing an extreme western forehand player, keep the ball low

2) If you're like me and use western forehand, when low balls are nailed at you, simply use a more conservative grip instead of trying to force it with the western forehand.

This tip ALONE has helped me win more than 2 dozen points since learning this simple strategy.

And there are TONS of common sense strategies all through out the Program that when you see them, it's almost like a light bulb goes off.

In my opinion, Tom is 2 points short of Jenius when it comes to tennis - and anyone who plays tennis, regardless of level, should have a copy on their shelf.

Check out the Shadow lob, and I think you'll agree:

[...] <=== Give this sneaky trick a go

Good luck!

8397984,5,B003JBI4KU,"This is a great DVD for those who always wanted to play tennis but didn't think they could because of their weight.  It may not seem serious at first glance,  but Tom is actually extremely thoughtful and encouraging. The tips and strategies he provides are very intelligent - and ones that I would have never thought of even though they are almost ""common sense"".  Will recommend to anyone who is ""thinking"" about playing - because with this DVD,  Tom proves that anyone CAN play (and play well) regardless of their weight!",1279584000,,523,4.714285714285714
8397985,5,B003JBI4KU,"I'm a PTR Certified Tennis Pro, with over 30 years of experience teaching/coaching, and I've seen literally thousands of club players over the years. This DVD has the exact kind of tips needed if you are a little bit or even ""hopelessly"" out of shape.

Even if you aren't totally out of shape and you're looking for a large collection of tips and equipment that will help you this DVD has an enormous amount of information... over 3 hours long!

Tom covers lots of unique and little known gadgets and equipment for staying cool and avoiding injury. He explains court geometry and tactics extremely well. His motto is ""run the other guy to death while you eat a piece of pizza"" hahaha, I loved that.

He shows drills to put pressure on your out of shape opponent and he explains drop shot and lob tactics too, and serving and return of serve techniques to run your opponent literally right into the fence. He covers way more than I can even fit in this review and I watched every single minute of his looooong 2 DVD set.

Tom has come up with a totally original approach to helping to deal with some of the problems that the overweight tennis lovers encounter on the court. Through this DVD, with an arsenal of tips that are right-on and so very useful, he will for sure help many players, ""not just overweight"", to improve their game, and start winning more against any style of opponent!! Good Job Tom!! Cheers!! SALUTennis!!",1279497600,2,1426,4.55859375
8397986,5,B003JBI4KU,"As a tennis coach and instructor, I have seen a lot of DVDs 'come and go', but this is one that will stay - as in your DVD player. Tom's got a TON of cool tips and tricks up his sleeve on this two DVD set, and even if you're NOT overweight or 'hopelessly-out-of-shape', you will definitely glean some insight into some killer tactics that you may not have ever thought to use before - because you didn't know they existed! If you ARE carrying around a few extra pounds, then this DVD will help you in three ways:

1. It will get you out on the court implementing his tactics and techniques, ergo you burn some calories.

2. It will help you figure out how to make your opponent start gasping for air - instead of you!

3. You'll instantly discover how to beat the 'gazelles' of the tennis world at their own game, by using what they love to do against them!

Tom also shows you a ton of cool gadgets he uses for post-match recovery, injury prevention, and game improvement. All in all, extremely high value packed into this DVD set, and well worth the price.",1272412800,4,1058,4.301507537688442
