I did not receive the complete series as advertised.  I received only the first season. After contacting Amazon about this incident, action was taken on the spot.  I received an immediate refund back into my card, and greatlakes media also contacted me and made an apology.  For my trouble (I suppose) they asked me to ""keep it, or throw it away"".  I happily kept it.",1323388800,5,602,4.36936936936937
8240242,4,B00113SCEQ,"A great show now available on the PSN network. You can download each indivisual episode for 1.99 as it includes the complete first season. This show is a laugh riot with some of the best voice acting out there. The story centers around the Devil trying to raise his 21 year old daughter Lucy, in the bay area. The problem is Lucy's new boyfriend just happens to be a DJ named Jesus. The episodes are only about 12 minutes in length and feature a transient score. I'll pass on films like Wedding Crashers and The Break Up, but I'll also treasure little found gems like this one. Hop online with your PS3 and dowload these shows now!",1255996800,2,631,4.401709401709402
8240243,5,B00113SCEQ,Lucy is the daughter of the devil. The devil is trying to be a good father. And Jesus is a Dj. Any more questions? Fluid Animation created this cartoon and it is twisted in every sense. But don't take my word for it have faith and watch it yourself.,1234051200,2,249,4.1020408163265305
8240244,5,B00113SCEQ,"I am a lover of animated shows.  That aside, this show took me by utter suprise.  I can actually say I have never seen a show with this premise before.  I was instantly entertained and had to wait a long time after the pilot episode aired for the show to be picked up.  Thank Satan (HAH) that it was and we got to enjoy several outtings with these characters.  DJ Jesus is just to hilarious for words as the second coming of JESUS.  He is in love with Lucy..the ANTICHRIST!!  Then you have to talk about Satan and his secretary...she was worth the entire show...I love it when secretaries steal the show!!  I am so glad some people got over their own religion enough for this to get on the air.  I am craving a second season and this DVD.  You will too!!",1216944000,13,754,4.20979020979021
8240245,4,B00113SCEQ,"Be forewarned: this series isn't for the crowds that don't like their animation to be a little strange, offbeat, or challenging. Lucy DoTD is one of the latest ventures from Loren Bouchard, who had earlier teamed up to create the incredibly popular series 'Home Movies' with Brendon Small.

The series surrounds Lucy, a normal looking girl (other than a pair of small black horns on her head) who just wants to paint, create art, and flirt with her DJ boyfriend. Her father (the devil) wants her to grow and become the anti-christ, which she could really care less about. Her boyfriend is none other than the reincarnation of Jesus, a fact (of many) that he's oblivious of. Meanwhile there's a crew of elite specialists from the vatican who are supposed to kill her, although they never quite succeed due to personal problems & failings within the crew.

The show's humor mostly surrounds parodies of horror films, books, & mythology surrounding the antichrist. While sometimes the humor can be hit or miss, overall the show is incredibly enjoyable to watch. In fact, it's actually more entertaining than other series that were still on AS such as Perfect Hair Forever & Xavier. There's a few rough patches to the series, but they are forgivable ones that will be smoothed out as the series progresses (if it is renewed).",1215561600,7,1321,4.84070796460177
8240246,5,B00113SCEQ,We LUV this show! My wife got me hooked on watching this on the cartoon network. We cannot wait for this to be out on DVD! Will buy the season for us and family as well!,1203984000,4,169,3.7222222222222223

Look at your chubby cheeks,

Cartoon Network's Adult Swim have become the absolute masters of dishing out servings of twisted animated humor in 15 minutes or less.  ""Lucy the Daughter of the Devil"" is a welcome addition to their stable.  The premise is exactly what it sounds like: Satan's rebellious daughter (voiced by a sassy Melissa Bardin Galsky) is more interested in being a typical young lady and romancing the possible second coming of Christ, DJ Jesus (pronounced in Spanish like hey-soos), then in bringing about the end of days.  The characters in this all CG show vaguely resemble cock-eyed Legos figurines and the budget is obviously quite low.  But as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Park/dp/B00023P49C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Park</a>&nbsp;continues to prove, great comedy doesn't require fancy effects or even halfway decent animation, just solid writing.  This show has exactly that.

The first episode is arguably the strongest and is pretty much 11 minutes of solid laughs with some blatant homages to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/B0000524CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omen/dp/B000HCO87W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omen</a>&nbsp;thrown in for good measure.  The characters and the music are the strongest points in the series and are played for chuckles rather well.  One episode features Lucy attempting to tell her father (who owns a sex toy company, Sinspirations, which parodies Willy Wonka's factory) about her ideas for the ultimate dildo.  One would think that The source of all evil would play it cool, but it turns out NO father wants to hear that from his little girl.  Classic.  The Devil's arc follows his attempts to help the political career of a satanic congressman.  His enagements with Senator Whitehead and with his own charming skullfaced secretary, Becky, the Devil's advocate, make up a large part of the show and are usually good for at least few snickers.  Opposing our evil protagonists are the bumbling Special Fathers, sent by the Catholic church to kill the antichrist.  Add one shrieking, gun-toting nun known in her school days as ""Hairy Mary"" to that mix and you've got yourself a show.

The music that accompanies each wonderful title sequence is twisted and humorous, and usually the highlight of the episode.  A child vampire choir singing ""Boogey Oogey Oogey"" as they tear apart the congregation comes immediately to mind.  Then there is a fantasticly humorous rendition of Alice Cooper's ""Go To Hell"" that is accompanied by the visual of a figure being dismembered in perfect time with the music.  The Devil himself turns out to have quite a girlish singing voice and a talent for making musical romance.  And a giant monster that can only be defeated by human beatboxing?  Yeeeaaah Boyeeee!  Turns out the Pope is a crummy beatboxer.  Who knew?

""Lucy the Daughter of the Devil"" is not perfect and at times drags just a little with excessive dialogue and jokes that aren't as clever as they'd like to be.  The title character is often pushed aside for flights of fancy with the Special Fathers, DJ Jesus, or yet more cutesy dialogue between Satan and Becky.  This is okay every once in a while, but in a mere 11 episode season it's a problem.  But, hey, this is a show that has a  sentient tumor in one episode so what's a little pacing problem?  Consider this a necessary show for fans of offbeat animation who enjoy having their darkness made light of.",1199232000,26,3720,5.5
