8750979,5,B01BPEBDO6,"Cannon Season One and Two were previously released in 2008 thru 2010 on pressed DVDs by CBS/Paramount. The first 2 seasons were released as 2 Volumes per season. Then in 2013 CBS/Paramount released season 3 in its entirety, however they put it on DVD-Rs instead of pressed DVDs. Pressed DVDs are supposed to last longer than DVD-Rs. Then CBS/Paramount did NOT release the final 2 seasons of Cannon. CBS/Paramount did not remaster Cannon. The video quality is like VHS, contrasty and sometimes there is a thin band of color on the left side of the screen. Then in 2015 VEI released Cannon as a box set with all 5 seasons including the pilot movie and the ""revival"" movie, ""The Return of Frank Cannon"". Now in 2016 VEI has also released the 1st season separately. This VEI release is NOT remastered and is missing the episodic promos that were on the earlier CBS/Paramount releases. However ALL the DVDs are on pressed DVDs and are single sided and have color labels on them unlike the grey labels that CBS/Paramount used. Each season is in a  plastic  6 DVD case, except for season 5 which is a 7 DVD case, and all the cases fit in a cardboard slipcase. And it appears all the original 1970s music is retained and the episodes are NOT cut, they are complete and are around 50 minutes each. The extras are the 2 movies and a 7 minute slide show of scenes from the series set to the theme music(these extras are on the DVDs in the season 5 case). Cannon is different than the rest of the private eye shows, he is a loner with no regular supporting cast like the Rockford files and Mannix and he is fat, William Conrad frequently jokes about his weight. Cannon is a fast paced show with believable action in it. Cannon is a tough, but likeable guy. It's too bad VEI didn't remaster Cannon, the show deserves it, but at least they released the whole series uncut on colorful pressed DVDs. If you like classic TV with masculine private eyes and fast paced stories you should buy Cannon.",1460505600,,1980,4.512534818941504
