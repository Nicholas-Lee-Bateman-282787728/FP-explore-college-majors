3498627,5,B001BSBBC6,"Watching these dvd's brought back soooo many memories of my happy childhood. The episodes were so funny and very entertaining,after some of the more hilarious shows were over me,my brothers and sisters would try to reinact them. Like making something to ride on similar to the fire engine the gang made that was falling apart as they went down the street or dressing up to play the part of the many characters they played. I even let my 12 and 13 year old nieces and nephews watch them. They loved it. I also loved that they also  colorized them .I definitely suggest these dvd's to help bring back the good old days.",1303516800,,617,4.508928571428571

3498630,4,B001BSBBC6,"I give this only **** four stars because most of these films have already been released on DVD restored from 35mm. There is little new here.

The thought is that kids won't watch B&W films, so lets COLORIZE The Litle Rascals. Purists can watch this in B&W also, which is good since the colorization looks cartoony & unnatural.

I just could not pass up the extras that are included on these DVDs.

BEST OF OUR GANG has
Alfalfa short soundie ""The Singing Lesson"",
Broadway Highlights short clip of Pete the Pup becoming a member of a entertainment night club,
""You Asked For It"" clip of the segment with the OUR GANG REUNION showing the silent stars (Jackie Condon, Joe Cobb, Farina & others) as they are in 1955.
Our Gang clip from ""The Stolen Jewels"" ( o.k. this is the only clip un necessary as the complete short is widely available ).

Oh, yes.. there are the comedy shorts. These are all from 35mm 1950's RE-ISSUE PRINTS, not the same MGM transfers as the Cabin Fever / Hallmark DVDs. But they are 35mm prints and they look very good. There is a variety of title sections representing almost every company that re-issued these shorts in 35mm, including Official Films which I never knew made 35mm prints.

BEST OF OUR GANG
""FLY MY KITE"" - Official 'Famous Kids' titles - The rascals help Grandma save her property from the evil banker.

""A LAD IN A LAMP"" - ERKO 'Kids 'n Pets' titles (1st time on DVD?)- Spanky & the gang find a 'magic lamp'. Spanky whishes Buckwheat was a monkey and thinks his wish came true when a real monkey comes in (there is always one around in a Little Rascals comedy).

""KID FROM BORNEO"" - Monogram titles - a short that has been long banned from television due to racial jokes & the main character being a wild man from borneo who goes around saying ""Yum , Yum , Eat'em Up"" while chasing Spanky & the gang. It is unlikely that Hallmark will do an official release of this on their DVD sets, so you might want to consider this if you don't have the old Cabin Fever videos.

""HI! NEIGHBOR"" - Allied Artists titles - The gang gets a new neighbor, who owns a shiny new kiddie firetruck.

""HIDE & SHRIEK"" - Official 'Famous Kids' titles - another classic featured on this disc starring Alfalfa, Buckweat & Porky. Alfalfa plays a sherlock holmes type of detective and hires Buckweat & Porky to investigate some missing candy.

The shorts are offered in both Colorized & original B&W restored versions, but switching back & forth while playing the short is not possible. The bonus material is B&W only.",1266192000,,2528,4.512035010940919

together.  They loved the first episode the best and they begged to take
it home with them.",1246838400,,165,4.892857142857143
3498632,5,B001BSBBC6,"This is a video for both young, and old. A surprise feature is the ability to watch in color. I would have liked the contents more detailed...more info about each clip. But, this aside, I highly recommend buying this. It's a good watch for...oldsters...boomers...children...grandkids!",1244073600,,284,5.4772727272727275
3498633,5,B001BSBBC6,"You probably remember the Cabin Fever tapes from back when you were a kid.  After all, where can you find a more wholesome piece of Americana than in the Depression-era antics of Spanky and company?  Now that you're grown, you probably want to introduce your kids to Our Gang the same way that your parents introduced them to you, as a part of their socialization as equally wholesome, proud citizens.  There's only one problem, I suspect: kids today have no tolerance for ""antiquated"" black and white cinema.  And really, who can blame them?  Color, the de facto standard to which they were raised, lends life, vibrancy and realism to anything that it glazes.

Thanks to this DVD, you can now bridge that generation gap by watching this newly colorized version of the Little Rascals' greatest shorts (even on the kids' Playstation if need be!).  The drab, depressing black and white of '30s film suddenly comes to life in a full rainbow.  And, should you succeed in making your kids into new fans, you'll always have the option of graduating them to the thoughtfully included black and white versions of the colorized material.  From what I can tell, there's simply no other DVD that allows you the same flexibility.

Hardcore fans of Our Gang should take note of this disc's special features, which include clips of the gang's twenty year reunion and a hilarious skit where they encounter peer jokesters Laurel and Hardy.",1227657600,,1423,4.8429752066115705

8284620,4,B001BSBBC6,"My expectations were different--perhaps I should have ordered another title.  My grandson is in the musical Ragtime at his high school.  One of the characters gets into movie production and wants to create a series of films with a group of kids from all different backgrounds getting along.  I expected a later show from the cover of the DVD case.  Spanky was quite young and most of the ""regulars"" were not in it.  The episodes did not reflect the variety of the group members.  Quality, etc. was fine.",1481414400,,503,4.659090909090909
