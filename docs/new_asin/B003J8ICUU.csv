The audience sees a bit of Weber and a lot of images from the given period and each lecture is a good mixture of general over view and a few illustrative details.  What is great is that Weber makes a few good salient points in each which help to sum up the accomplishments and challenges of the period.  The style is both objective and dramatic.  He does generally follow the established, traditional view for the ancient period, ""dark ages"" and middle ages.  It is a fine introduction or refresher for these periods.  You won't find revisionst theories but the basic, conventional approach which is a good starting point for those times.  BUT when he addresses the Rennasiance and then the early modern (15th-16th century) periods, things really pick up.  He is at his very best when dealing with the 19th and 20th centuries, which were his specialities.  He provides excellent insight, far more sophisticated that what you ever get in other educational programs about the some material.  Weber was a specialist in European social movements and his analysis makes the viewer really understand what was pressuring and motivating average people through rough waters and toward the very tragic outcomes in the World Wars.  We get really excellent insight into how we got to the late 20th century economic and political world in the western world (he does address colonial empires in this context).  I thoroughly enjoyed these and they helped bring the history to life for my teenager.  The half hour format is perfect for busy people.",1336953600,2,1710,4.895833333333333
