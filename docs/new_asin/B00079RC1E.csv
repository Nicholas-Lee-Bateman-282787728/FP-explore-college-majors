8046445,5,B00079RC1E,"I was encouraged to buy this video by the good reviews I had read, and they weren't wrong.

The videographer's love of the sport is evident and the camera craft is great. Also good was the above-water interaction among the divers. A real treat for divers--and for anybody else who likes exotic adventures.",1170720000,3,305,4.754716981132075
8046446,1,B00079RC1E,"After reading all the great reviews of this video I was excited to receive it. Unfortunately, it failed to live up to expectations. Much of the video centers around the divers. As a wreck diver, I recognized many of the names but the video failed to report any interesting facts about them. The narrator simply repeatedly announced their names as they came on screen. The video actually offers little to no insight into such things as gear configuration or diving techniques as suggested by another reviewer. The underwater videography on the wreck was interesting but was a small part of the video. The bulk of the video was the narrator dryly repeating the same lines over and again.",1168300800,2,685,4.813559322033898
8046447,5,B00079RC1E,"This short documentary about Wreck Divers was fascinating.  The underwater photography was excellent, unusually clear shots around a wreck after such a long submergence.

On a personal note it was an emotional experience seeing my old sub, my home for a year, 61 years later.  I last saw it being towed from the sub base at New London out to Block Island to be torpedoed.  I wasn't aware that the Bass was in a thirties movie as U-Boat, very interesting.

8046448,5,B00079RC1E,"This is a ""must have"" video for anyone interested in Scuba Diving, Wreck exploration, or World War II history. Capt Lou Costello brings a group of professional divers together off the coast of Rhode Island for a dive on the USS Bass, a WWII sub. Its interesting to see how the Pros prepare for and manage their equipment and the dive. As a non-diver, I found the video probably the next best thing to actually being there. And to see the old Sub and how it has fared over the years in the dark depths of the Atlantic was fascinating. Capt Lou took me down there with them and showed me a part of the world I would otherwise never see and for this I thank him. A great video to have in your collection.",1113264000,18,701,4.2
8046449,4,B00079RC1E,"The Wreck Hunters: Dive to the Wreck of the USS Bass explores the history, mystery, and tragedy surrounding this vessel.  During her time as a naval submarine in World War II, a fire claimed the lives of 25 crew members.  She was decommissioned, converted to a cargo carrier and finally, in 1945 deliberately sunk near Block Island, off the coast of Rhode Island, USA.  To learn more of this intriguing tale and visit her remains join the salty Captain Lou, his crew and fellow divers as they journey through New England waters and take you 160' beneath the sea.",1111968000,16,562,4.656565656565657
