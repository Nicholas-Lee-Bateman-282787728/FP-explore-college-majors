When his setup is good, easily graspable and inherently funny the whole thing works almost effortlessly. Each character is clearly defined, and what happens to them is something you really care about--the best formula to have. This is one of the top ten Allen films for me.",1509408000,2,386,4.776119402985074

SYNOPSIS--

In this Prohibition era farce, a mobster bankrolls an unknown, talentless dramatist's new play and as part of the deal strong-arms his equally untalented girlfriend into a major role. The aging leading lady, an often inebriated adulteress, seduces the playwright so that her part can be enlarged in rewrites. The leading man grows enormously fat from clandestine rehearsal binge eating and tries to hide his expanding waistline with a corset.

Watching from the back of the theater is the gangster's scary-looking legbreaker, there to guard the big guy's girlfriend, an egomaniacal ignoramus with a voice like a bucket of glass. This inarticulate thug thinks the show as it stands is terrible, so he rewrites pages of clumsy dialogue and turns a disaster into a potential hit (if his boss's sweety doesn't appear in it). Great fun and perfectly paced, this one has a just-right finale. Another superior work by Mr. Allen.
