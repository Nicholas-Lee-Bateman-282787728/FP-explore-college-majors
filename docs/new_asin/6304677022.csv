Gokou's voice, as provided by Masako Nozawa, is a whole new world for the Occidental otaku who have loved the series with a more masculine  voice. Nevertheless, the plot is not new: you have seen it somehow in the  series, with different names and situations. Besides, the villain in this  movie, Garlic Jr., is a demon who will scare small children when he  confronts even God (Kami). Good for the experience of japanese voices.",915408000,,505,4.7701149425287355

Piccolo and Krillin come to help Goku, but they are too late and not strong enough. The Dragon has already been summoned. The wish has been made and a Dead Zone has been created. With Goku, Piccolo, and Krillin being too weak; Gohan is the only one who can finish the job. But Gohan is just a munchkin.

This is another really good movie! I like most of the DBZ movies. Usually I prefer the newer ones, but this one is a very good. I think anyone that likes DBZ will enjoy this movie.",1351555200,,621,4.132231404958677

904482,5,6304677022,"Like I said up there in the title, this DVD is quite old. It was originally released in North America on December 9, 1997. So just to have this is amazing to me, but also this is the uncut version of the film. Plus the dub, BEST PART! It's the original Ocean Dub of the film, like I watched when I was younger when this movie came on Toonami. So it was great to see the movie with it's original voice actors, like I had watched it so long ago. I have not watched the movie with the Japanese audio on it yet, but I will it's just that I got the movie today.

The DVD was in perfect condition, the case was also in perfect condition, and pretty much everything was in great condition. Looked great even for a DVD in 1080p(watched it on a Blu-ray player), and it also sounded good for such an early DVD release.

All in all, for only about $4, this was a great buy. I would highly recommend this for fans of Dragon Ball Z that want the first DBZ movie, original Ocean Dub of this film, and with the original Japanese audio as well.",1329436800,3,1028,4.084158415841584

What you've neglected is that this film has been redubbed by the immeasurably inferior FUNImation Studios voice actors.

If you want slick features, uncut dialogue, and an altogether newer product, go ahead and take this.

But, if you'd prefer a movie with vastly superior sound effects, music, and voice acting talent (which is 50% of your viewing experience), avoid this, and all other FUNImation dubs, like the plague.",1204329600,,589,5.061855670103093
904486,3,6304677022,"This movie is pretty good overall. It is very heavy on action, which leaves the story line a little on the thin side. Not to say that it doesn't make sense. This movie actually could fit in to the story line better than some of the other movies. The basic story line involves a character named Garlic Jr. He wants to gather the Dragonballs to wish for immortality. While searching for the Dragonballs, the last one he needs winds up being the four-star ball, which is in the possesion of Gohan, the son of Goku. Garlic Jr. kidnaps Gohan and is surprised by the high level of power Gohan has at his age, and wants to take him in as his pupil. Goku finds out that Gohan has been kidnapped and quickly retreives the Dragon Radar to locate him. Galic Jr. gets to make his wish before he gets there. Goku teams up with Piccolo, Krillin, and Kami to combat this immortal foe. Garlic Jr. creates a ""Dead Zone"" to suck Goku and and company in to. Seeing his friends suffering unleashes Gohan's hidden power and he throws Garlic Jr. in to the Dead Zone. Overall, this is a fairly decent DBZ movie.",1185235200,,1088,4.364532019704433
904487,4,6304677022,"Of all the numerous DBZ American movie releases (discounting The History of Trunks and Bardock the Father of Goku) Dead Zone was the first and the best, and the only one to actually have some life in the series. In many ways, it's an introduction to the DBZ series, as it introduces Goku as he is currently, shows us what he's been up to, and brings in his son, Gohan. Along with that, Piccolo and Krillin join the action.

And in this one, the bad guy wins. Garlic Jr., who later has a saga between Freeza and Trunks, starts the movie by collecting the Dragon Balls and making his wish for immortality with the Eternal Dragon. But, while obtaining the balls, Garlic Jr. kidnaps Gohan, who wears the 4-star ball on a hat, and thus Goku gets involved. In an attempt to save his son, Goku, with Krillin's help, and eventually Piccolo's help as well, battles Garlic Jr.'s numerous, spice-related henchmen until the final, inevitable showdown with the immortal Garlic Jr., who has not only a powerful fighting form, but the Dead Zone sucking in the Earth into its Limbo as well. And then, Gohan stirs...

This movie carries itself with some great action, and in this one it has yet to become pointless. Enemies aren't suddenly introduced to make the movie longer. We know who Goku will face from the start. Along with that, it has some pretty funny moments, like Gohan's tripping scene--he accidentally eats a drug-laced fruit--which ends with Gohan peeing on Krillin's head.

Unfortunately, this movie started the never-ending trend of keeping the ""movie"" length less than an hour. Everything in this movie, and the ones to come, seem jammed in. Something you rarely see in the DBZ series is a fight that lasts less than five minutes. Most go into episode after episode. Maybe this was a good thing about the movie, but you kind of get used to something and to have it suddenly stop is kind of a jarring feeling.

Still, Dead Zone is the best of the movies, with some good action and laughs. And the good thing about this movie is that anyone could pick it up and enjoy it, whether you're a new fan or a long-standing one. And if you haven't yet seen this and you are a fan, then pick this up.",1138147200,,2190,4.550761421319797

I suppose there's some market for ""DBZ,"" and perhaps I'm not one of them, but I feel like a story would've helped this mini-film a lot. What little story there is involves Goku going to rescue his son Gohan from a weird little guy named Garlic Jr., who has collected all the dragon balls together and wished for immortality.

904808,5,6304677022,"Dragonballz is the amazing anime by Akira Toriyama, a

legendary Japanese writer and animator.

Dragonballz is the epic adventure of a Saiyan warror

named Goku and his friends against good and evil.

The series actually started with ""Dragonball"" in 1985,

when Goku was a kid. Goku started as being a remarkable

child with incredible strength like ""Superman"".

We find later in ""Dragonball"" that Goku is not

an ordinary kid, but a Saiyan, a very powerful race

of warriors. Goku eventually meets Master Roshi,

a great warrior himself who has lived for the past

thousand years!!! Roshi, trains Goku for martial

arts tournaments, and his epic battles.

Goku also meets friends like Kuririn, Bulma, Oolong

( a shapeshifter) and his wife Chichi, all who

help Goku in his daily quests against evil.

In both ""Dragonball"", ""Dragonballz"", and ""Dragonball

GT"" , the main focus is also on what's called

a Dragonball. A Dragonball , we learn, can be gathered

and used to grant wishes for good and evil purposes.

7 Dragonballs are needed to make a wish, but all

the Dragonballs are in dangerous places with

foes. Part of the fun of watching ""Dragonball"" and

""Dragonballz"" is what the characters have to do

to get them, and how they overcome enormous obstacles

to get them.

At the end of ""Dragonball"" Goku fights Mr. Piccolo,

A Namek warrior with great powers. Also at the

end, Goku and Chichi have a child named Gohan.

This movie ""The Dead Zone"" originally released in 1989,

revolves an evil leader named Garlic Jr. from

the darkside.

Garlic Jr. and his band of warriors come from

the Darkside to extract chaos and horror on Earth.

We learn that Garlic Jr. main motive is revenge against

a holy warrior priest named Kami (His name is God in the

Japanese version).

Kami, like Mr. Piccolo is a Namek with extraordnary

powers. We learn that Kami enslaved, and battled

with Garlic Jr. father and put away inside a ""Dead

Zone"".

Garlic Jr. comes up with the brilliant plan of getting

all the Dragonballs, to get unlimited power.

Garlic Jr. also makes the stupid mistake of

kidnapping Goku's son, Gohan, and pretty soon,

Goku, Piccolo and many others, enlist

an epic , climatic fight Garlic Jr.

This film has a great share of action scenes with

Goku, including a scene in which Goku uses

the ""Kamehameha"" (A powerful energy beam) to

destroy one of Garlic's henchman.

The movie also has alot of humor, including when

Goku's son, Gohan, gets drunk, and starts causing

trouble with Garlic Jr.

This movie also like ""Dragonballz"" starts revealing

the hidden power that Gohan has. Just like his

dad, Gohan, is a Saiyan with great strength.

""Dragonballz"" ended in 1995, but it's till now that

the series has aired in U.S., and with great success.

Akira Toriyama, has made millions with the success of

""Dragonballz"" and it's movies, and has gained a whole

new audience in the U.S..

The ""Dragonballz"" franchise is one of the most

popular Japanese anime's in the U.S.. Games,

DVD's, music videos, have all been done with

the Dragonballz copyright.

The U.S. though has only aired 3 movies of ""Dragonballz""

on Cartoon Network, but seeing all the movies, I can

tell that all the movies are great, and terrific!!!

This movie ""The Dead Zone"" is a great intro into the

world of ""Dragonballz"" and will most certainly satisfy

anime and action fans of all ages.",1096675200,,3387,4.798951048951049
904928,5,6304677022,"Gohan is kidnapped by the menacing Garlic Jr because he wants revenge from Kami over his father Garlic's death. Goku, Piccolo, Gohan and Krillin join the fight as Garlic Jr opens the dead zone to suck KAmi's tower in it. action highlights include when Goku knocks one of Jr's henchmen with his powerpole into a domebuilding then blows it up, where Gohan crys out and knocks Garlic Jr. in and where Piccolo fights a henchmen. purely for fans, others would find it corny. uncut version is better",1066262400,,493,4.67816091954023
904929,5,6304677022,"The dead zone takes place before the events in the Sayin saga.  In it the evil Garlic Jr. is searching for the seven dragon balls so he can wish to become immortal.  In his search the last one he needs is on the hat of Gohan.  He and his troops kidnapp Gohan and Garlic can sense a tremendouse energy coming from the young boy.  It is because of this that he wants to addopt Gohan as his own.
In the Meantime Goku has discovered that GOhan has been captured and immedietly uses the Dragon Radar to track him down.  By the time he gets there though Garlic Jr. Has already made his wish for immortality.  Goku teams up with Piccolo and Kami and they battle Garlic Jr for the sake of earth, however in the end GOhan uses his sleeping powers to attack Garlic and throw him into the Dead Zone.  From there we can assume that one year later (due to the fact that it takes on year for the Dragon balls to be restored) the events of the Sayin Saga take place.
This is one of the better DBZ movies (they all are great but) and in saying that I mean that it fits into the story line or mainstream universe (the others being Bardock, Coolers Revenge, and History of Trunks) while the other movies focus on a sub universe.  Overall this is a must own for any DBZ fan or causal anime fan.",1039219200,,1275,4.154471544715447
904930,4,6304677022,"INTRO/PLOT:  Fans of the later sagas of DBZ tend not to like this movie as much because of its ""lack-of"" ki (energy) attacks.  This movie is mostly about hand-to-hand fighting which I miss so much in the series as it progresses.  Since this is the first movie, you won't see such characters as Vegeta or Trunks.  This is basically a Goku save Gohan early DBZ movie.  Akira Toriyama (the creator) tends to make the movies (when he does make them) sort of like the series.  This movie is basically a spin-off of the Raditz battle, in that Gohan is catured by the villain and Goku and Piccolo team up to fight the villain for their own means.  Heck, even the villain (Garlic Jr.) uses a few attacks that Raditz does.  So its pretty obvious.
DVD:  The DVD is ok, but a little annoying.  Everytime you go to the main menu, you are greeted by the Eternal Dragon Shenlong saying his famous phrase about what is your desire.  It gets old really fast.  Most people enjoy quick and to-the-point menus, and this certainly doesn't deliver in that aspect.  The good thing is that the original Japanese audio track is included...which was one of the few things Pioneer did well with DBZ while they had it.
EXTRAS:  This is one of the only DVDs in DBZ history to have original unedited clips from the series included.  Its a nice addition from the usual ""commercials"" that are included in the present DBZ DVDs.
AUDIO:  The audio is very good quality.  Japanese & English audio tracks are included so you get the best of both worlds, depending on which you are a fan of.  The Dub isn't ""too"" bad, although a little below par.  The Japanese always blows the English audio away as far as DB is concerned though.
OVERALL:  Overall, I liked this DVD, even though its a mere 60 minutes (actually 50-something).  If I were the buyer, I would purchase this DVD as long as its under [price], otherwise you are spending too much for the time of the movie.  As far as the quality of the DVD, I can put up with the annoying menus enough to enjoy this better DBZ movie.",1029888000,,2041,4.444743935309973

Basically Garlic Jr. becomes immortal after kidnapping Gohan and using the 4 star Dragonball on his hat. Gokuu (or Goku) but is said Gokuu in the movie comes to save his son, yadie yadie ya. Then Kurrin (or Krillin) comes to help. Then Piccilo comes because the hench men beat him up a long time ago. Gohan knocks Garlic Jr. into the Dead Zone he's trapped there.

7875207,4,6304677022,"Welcome to my fourth review and now i will be telling you about Dragon Ball Z ""The Dead Zone"". to put it simply this is DBZ's first movie and did they had to pull it off, so did they? well yeah they did and since they did let me get my cons out of the way right here. first would be the action because when i watch it the action feels stale and just isn't DBZ it isn't intense, but i understand that this is immediately following dragon ball so i somewhat forgive it for being a little more styled for Dragon Ball. second con is that way too long gohan musical dream sequence at the beginning but other than that its a good movie. for the plot its pretty much the same as the plot for season one's start where Goku has to go rescue his son from Garlic Jr. and Garlic's too powerful so he teams up with piccolo the anti-hero in order to stop him. i won't spoil anything but the ending is why i  liked this movie particularly more than i would since it wasn't typical and was fairly surprising. no special OST but added with a little bit of humor and characters i grew up with leaves me awarding this with the (Enjoyable Watch) rating.",1370908800,,1133,4.15
