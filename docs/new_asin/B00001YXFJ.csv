7915003,3,B00001YXFJ,"This movie is pretty silly. The plot is awful what there is of one. The only thing worth the puchase price of this film is the first scene in which Gloria rides a bucking washing machine. She puts every bit of her body on that thing separately and says ""Sorry about the mess..."" to some guy with his tongue hanging out at the end of it. After this she takes lotion and rubs it all over herself puts on her little outfit and that's the end of it. It only lasts a few minutes but,it is so funny and so hot. Get it just for a laugh.",1363305600,,529,3.953271028037383
7915004,2,B00001YXFJ,"This DVD comes with one feature and one short.
Vampire Call Girls is a silly film.  It is not surprising that it is an excuse to show topless women, but it makes little sense otherwise.
[...] No consistency.
The nude scenes are just that, with little or no action.
Battle of the Colossal Women makes even less sense.[...]
Both the battle and love scene between the two women are super staged and awkward.  Both woman look like they want to look like they are trying to do something without actually touching; almost as if they are afraid of exceeding their contract.
For simple visual pleasure, Vampires is the better piece, but both are worse than much of what you can find on cable and TV.",1054598400,4,691,4.52
7915005,1,B00001YXFJ,"The editorial reads ""Two features for one low price"" Obviously I have a different concept of the word 'feature' as the film ""Battle of the Colossal Women"" is about 35mins long. Hardly a 'feature'.
And what of the film itself? It's about two women who are increased in size by some scientific experiment, who then push and shove each other for a while (hardly a 'battle'), and then carress each other a little.
Vampire Call Girls was a dud too, but was in fact long enough to be both a 'feature' and an exercise in boredom.",1053388800,3,522,4.447916666666667
7915006,1,B00001YXFJ,"My expectations weren't very big for this movie.  I mean hell, it's called Vampire Call Girls, ya know it's gonna be cheap.  I was hoping that this would be one of those ""it's so bad it's good"" movies, but nope, it was just bad.
It's Bill Sims birthday, the guys are over celebrating and he's telling them his dream.  In the dream he called up the Night Vamps escort service.  Well low and behold, she turns out to be a vampire.  Bill manages to escape and calls up the service.  Wanting his money back, he goes to the Night Vamps headquaters and finds himself with 3 more vamps.  Turns out it wasn't a dream though, and he gets turned into a vampire himself.
You get unattractive girls with implants wiggling around naked and a bunch of nasty guys (sorry folks, no sex).  The only redeeming quality is Lilith Stabs the 'fetish' model, and believe it or not, she's the only one that doesn't get naked.  She plays a wannabe-goth vampire in a Walmart Morticia costume, go-go boots and sunglasses (light sensitive maybe? or going for that oh-so-cool look?).
If you're still curious, rent it.  If for some reason you think the above would still turn you on, then go for it.  *shrugs*",971913600,,1179,4.514150943396227
7915007,4,B00001YXFJ,"Starring Lillith Stabs, gothic sex symbol, and buxom babes Roxanne Michaels, Lisann Devaul, and Glori-Anne Gilbert.  Directed by Everette Hartsoe
A man is out on the town, looking for some action. He decides  to use an escort service, and unfortunately he picks one where the girls  think he's quite yummy, literally.
Not alot to it other than the ladies,  the film is low budget, and underdeveloped, but if you are a fan of gothic,  bondage, or horror themed T&A flicks, try it out, it's a shame they  don't have the box art, Lillith is quite the hottie with her jet black hair  with a big white streak in it laying in a coffin suggestively.",963792000,3,642,4.578947368421052
