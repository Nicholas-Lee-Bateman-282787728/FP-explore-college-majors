8041536,5,B0006GBMS2,"I've been an avid Corrie fan for over 40 years;  these 4 DVDs, produced by Granada in 2004, provide a superb summay of characters and past story lines.  The 13 specials, spanning 19 1/2hours, include actors' comments as well as archival footage and are grouped  into catagories:  Barmaids, Double Acts, Weddings, Deaths, Love Cheats, Villians, Tracy Barlow Exposed, When Karen met Steve, Hunks, The Street Undressed, In-Laws/Out-Laws, Peter Barlow Exposed and Richard Hillman Exposed.  For those who haven't seen a lot of Corrie, this set provides an excellent foundation;  it fills in the gaps and makes any future viewing more enjoyable.  For those who have closely followed the program, it's a marvelous journey down memory lane.  Should be required viewing for those who act or write humerous drama - truly a master class in how to do it properly.",1395100800,,851,5.071942446043166
8041537,5,B0006GBMS2,"I got this DVD for Christmas and had thoroughly enjoyed watching the little bit of it I have.  It's divded into 4 DVDs, each with 3 45-minute segments.  The segments have titles like ""Barmaids,"" ""Births & Deaths,"" ""Villains,"" etc.  They're all REALLY well done, featuring both clips from the show and interviews with current and former actors, as well as directors and writers.  They also feature ""behind the scenes"" looks and neat little facts.  An absolute must for all devoted CS fans!",1104019200,9,488,4.902439024390244
