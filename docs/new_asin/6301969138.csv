398304,5,6301969138,"This beautiful story of fallen love from director Clarence Brown is given a romantic glow seldom seen in sound pictures. Garbo's magic, only occasionally seen in her sound films, is gloriously displayed here by photographer William Daniels. John Gilbert's charisma is also shown to great advantage, giving those who never saw him an explanation for his huge popularity during the silent era.

There is more story than usual is this lush and romantically told tale of forbidden love that just won't die and the long friendship it threatens. Based on Hermann Sudermann's novel, ""The Undying Past,"" Benjamin F. Glazer's screenplay doesn't really seem that dated even today. The settings arranged by Cedric Gibbons and Frederic Hope make this fabulous production from MGM one of Garbo's finest films.

Leo von Harden (John Gilbert) and Ulrich (Lars Hanson) are military men whose bond runs deep and far, all the way back to childhood when they became blood-brothers in the presence of Ulrich's little sister Hertha (Barbara Kent) on the ""Isle of Friendship."" When as young men they return home, Leo sees for the first time the woman who will perhaps destroy not only that friendship, but Leo himself.

Garbo is the image of romance stepping off the train in her first screen moments. It is not long after at a ball that the two meet again, the white rose exchanged at their first meeting in hand. The scenes that follow are some of the most romantic in screen history. William Daniels frames Garbo's Felicitas in matchlight and moonlight beneath an arbor as one of the most romantic build-ups to a screen kiss takes place.

The shots of Garbo and Gilbert that follow are justly legendary. Though fully clothed, there is an oozing afterglow of implied intimacy that can almost be felt by the viewer. The scenes are filled with romance which takes a sudden and dark turn when the husband Felicity did not inform Leo of finds them together. A duel incurs in which Leo prevails, but only the Pastor knows the real reason for the tragedy.

Garbo's scenes picking out the right veil to mourn in shows the viewer all that Leo can not see with his eyes. He will have to spend five lonely years in Africa before he can return to her so they may be together. He implores his friend for life, Ulrich, to watch after her until he returns. He will not realize what a mistake it was until he returns and finds the two married, Ulrich being unaware of their prior love, and unable to resist her charms.

Barbara Kent is terrific as the grown Hertha, whose crush on Leo as a child has turned into an abiding love ignored by a brooding Leo. Felicitas begs him to reconcile with his friend but her motives are not pure like the white rose and soon temptation will overcome them. What follows cannot be revealed to the viewer but you will not see the ending of this romantic drama coming in any way.

Garbo and Gilbert were actually in love here, and it comes across in every scene. It is ironic that the haze of Garbo's spell cast over Gilbert in real life would destroy him nearly to the same degree as Mayer did when sound came along. This is a beautiful and romantic film with a lush and lovely glow you will not find anywhere else. Watch Garbo and Gilbert by firelight some rainy night with someone you love. It is an unforgettable film experience.",1151366400,3,3330,4.653061224489796
398305,5,6301969138,"This is the first picture starring Garbo and John Gilbert together, and the sparks do fly. The story is already old and hackneyed, though it wouldn't prevent Hollywood from using it, or elements of it, a thousand times again.

Gilbert meets Garbo and they fall instantly in love. One night in her bedroom who should show up but her husband. Surprise! A duel is arranged (pistols) and Gilbert kills him. Since Gilbert is in the army he is sent away to Africa for five years as punishment. He and Garbo swear to wait for each other, and while he's away he tells his best friend (Lars Hanson) to watch out for her.

The five years go by and Gilbert returns only to find out Hanson and Garbo are married. Surprise! Another duel ensues (pistols again). But the friendship between Gilbert and Hanson is so strong that neither can shoot at the other; meanwhile, Garbo is crashing through thin ice while crossing a river trying to prevent the duel. Thus at movie's end Gilbert and Hanson have each other but neither has Garbo - who has gone to her just rewards for being such a wicked temptress. The story is high opera, but Garbo is beautiful and the whole picture is saturated with sex and passion. The print used on the DVD (and VHS) is excellent, and the musical score by Carl Davis is also very effective. Definitely worth a watch.",1134259200,2,1328,4.529166666666667
398306,5,6301969138,"Of course is a pleasure to see these brilliant silent films starring the great GARBO. ""Flesh and the Devil"" and ""The Mysterious Lady"" was part of my VHS collection. But ""The Temptress"" is a real surprise. Thanks to TCM for this and I (we) am waiting for ""The Torrent"" and more.

UNFORGIVEN: What happened with the Garbo pics collection? In the middle of one of the portraits montages there is a TALLULAH BANKHEAD picture. I don't understand! Who made the montage? Obvioulsy not a Garbo fan!",1128556800,8,490,4.6976744186046515
398307,5,6301969138,"I had been waiting for some of the late silent era's best films to be released on DVD, in particular those with Greta Garbo, and while hoping that there would be more, I'm still very pleased with the 3 Garbo films in this set.  The picture quality of ""The Mysterious Lady"" is not much better than my old VHS, but apart from this, I'm very pleased with the overall quality on these discs, particularly the wonderful musical scores for each one, some unusual and inventive photo montages and other special features.  Anyone interested in music would probably also find the half-hour documentary ""Settling the Score"" an unexpected and rewarding highlight, as I did.  It depicts the TCM Young Film Composers Competition, some work from each entrant and how the final score for ""The Temptress"" was done.  It helped me get a lot more insight into this challenging and fascinating work, and it left me with a much deeper appreciation and respect for good silent film scores.

No doubt everyone has one or more Garbo favourites, and perhaps TCM had trouble deciding which ones to include in this set.  For some powerful emotional drama, ""Flesh and the Devil"" is probably one of the best and a good choice, especially as it features the two biggest stars of the time who were drawing large audiences: Garbo and John Gilbert.  For a love story with espionage and suspense, it doesn't get much better than ""The Mysterious Lady"", and finally, ""The Temptress"" shows an interesting angle on Garbo's character.  Her sensuous and alluring beauty brings men's lives to ruin, but she is unaware of any wrong-doing on her own part; and in fact, when she does see what problems she has unintentionally caused, she ends up a pathetic alcoholic on the streets of Paris, making one last sacrifice out of love.  This story intrigued me the most, in fact, as it has some depth and an angle that might not be so obvious at first.  There is also an alternative happy ending which was shown to other audiences; also an interesting point to consider. Each film on these discs has an optional commentary by 3 different experts, covering all kinds of background information, some gossip and other insights to give a more in-depth and complete picture of Garbo and these three particular films.  No doubt there's something for everyone here, both for silent and general film or Garbo fans alike.",1127001600,14,2363,4.795566502463054
398308,4,6301969138,"Although part of the large scale GARBO:THE SIGNATURE COLLECTION featuring 7 of her 1930's films, THE GARBO SILENTS is available seperately for the silent film enthusiast or for those who don't want to purchase the whole package. It joins the sets of Buster Keaton and Lon Chaney films released earlier by TCM Archives. As with those sets the production values are high, the extras plentiful, and the set offered at a reasonable price considering what it contains.

I do however have a few issues with this new release. First up is the exclusion of the new documentary GARBO from this set (it's part of THE SIGNATURE COLLECTION). It is listed as being included according to the TCM website but instead there's a documentary on the recent rescoring of the movies by a group of young composers. While that is interesting and important, the documentary on Garbo is more important and would get more people to buy the set. The packaging is annoying too with two of the three films presented on a double sided DVD (which can come apart) although I suppose it does keep the price down.

Then there's the choice of films. I'm sure every Garbo fan has something to say about this. I would like to have seen WOMAN OF AFFAIRS included as I think that remains one of her very best silents with fine work from a young Douglas Fairbanks Jr. I also wish that they could have used the tinted print for THE MYSTERIOUS LADY that was used for the VHS release since the quality of this print is no better than that one which had damage issues. The musical accompaniment for this edition is much better than the old release and overall it's up to TCM's high standards. While not the best of her silents FLESH AND THE DEVIL still remains electrifying thanks to the chemistry between her and John Gilbert and the glorious photography of William Daniels. THE MYSTERIOUS LADY is fun with the courtmartial scene a standout and Garbo a knockout in every frame. THE TEMPTRESS gives us a look at Garbo at the start of her American career. Perhaps these films were chosen because she has a different leading man in each one or to give Garbo fans something to argue about. Who knows?

Nevertheless it's great to have Garbo back where she belongs, up there on the silver screen (even if its a lot smaller and not nearly as silver as it used to be). Thanks to TCM Archives for once again bringing us the good stuff from the M-G-M vaults. Keep it coming Warner Home Video. First Chaney, then Keaton and now Garbo. What's next? How about the Lillian Gish Collection (THE SCARLET LETTER, LA BOHEME, THE WIND) or the Tod Browning Collection (THE SHOW, WEST OF ZANZIBAR, FREAKS). Just a thought.",1126224000,25,2657,4.613107822410148
398309,4,6301969138,"Garbo is my favorite actress and I am very happy to see this collection, which is included in the ""Greta Garbo Signature Collection"" being released at the same time.  I am even more happy to see ""The Temptress"" available for the first time.  I would give this collection 5 stars if only they had included ""The Torrent"", her first Hollywood film, instead of ""Mysterious Lady"".  While the latter has been available on VHS, ""The Torrent"" has never been available on home video, not to mention the fact that this collection would then have included her first three Hollywood films. The only Garbo film previously available on DVD is ""Grand Hotel"", so despite this criticism, I salute TCM Archives for giving us this collection, and especially for releasing ""The Temptress"", never previously available.  I also recommend the TCM ARCHIVES LON CHANEY COLLECTION.",1118275200,10,855,5.042553191489362
398310,5,6301969138,The first time I saw this film I was completely overwhlemed by its artistry. I believe every would-be actor should see this film to understand the fine art of acting at its best. Of most note is not John Gilbert or Greta Garbo but LARS HANSEN. If you need more proof of this actor's phenomenal talent -- see The Scarlet Letter (1928)!!,1085702400,4,335,4.419354838709677
398311,5,6301969138,"Flesh and the Devil is my favorite silent film and one of my favorite movies period.  Of course, this film was the one that sparked the real life romance between Greta Garbo and John Gilbert.  Motion Picture Magazine, at the time, was right on it. In the December 1926 issue, an article on Garbo and Gilbert sported the following subtitle:  ""When Clarence Brown Filmed the Love Scenes with Greta Garbo and John Gilbert for 'The Flesh and the Devil,' He Was Working with Raw Material.""  Yes, especially for its time, the love scenes are red hot (accounts from the cameramen claimed that Garbo and Gilbert kept going even when the cameras stopped).  I think this film, however, is often overshadowed by the Gilbert/Garbo romance and the tragedy that would follow.  I find this film to be a classic based on the relationship between the two best friends in the film, the incredible acting, and the seductive atmosphere it presents.  The interesting backdrops (sometimes of a fantastical nature) lend further charm to the story.
The film seems to take place in 1800s Germany.  It certainly takes place before the First World War, as there is a sense of confidence and security among the characters and their families at the beginning of the film.  It was a time when the privileged classes lived in a sheltered world of their own and when honor meant everything.  The two best friends Leo (Gilbert) and Ulrich (played by Lars Hanson) are from this wealthy ""Junker"" class.  Leo is the free-spirited, spontaneous one, Ulrich the sensible, naive one.  Their seemingly unassailable friendship is threatened by the ""devil"" herself, Felicitas (Garbo).  Unaware, at the time, of the seductress' marriage, Leo soon finds himself in a duel with her husband.  Leo's victory results in his 3-year military assignment in Africa, where he waits anxiously to be with Felicitas again.  Only the two of them know of the passion they shared as a dispute at cards was the public reason for the duel. When Leo returns, he finds that his Felicitas is now married to his best friend.  The evil enticement of Felicitas soon seizes Leo by the flesh, and he cannot resist her passion, even at the sake of his friendship with Ulrich.  Will the devil cause the two best friends to meet their end in their own duel, or will the naive Ulrich prove the stronger of the characters?  Suspenseful to the end, you will definitely watch this film more than once.  Worth the price, especially for any Garbo, Gilbert, or silent film fan.",1032393600,24,2497,4.805620608899297

 I enjoyed all the drama... The characters were easy to believe...I try hating Felicitas (Greta Garbo) but it's dificult (what a face!!)
One more thing ... actually Leo was suppose to be gone for 5 yrs. but was really gone for 3 thanks to his friend...
fave scenes: 1)Leo covers up for Ulrich's being out late and get caught celebrating... 2) Greta Garbo's close up at her home when she's laying down talking to Ulrich... 3)when Ulrich finds out his love is married to his bff... (damn! that's gotta sting!)

398387,5,6301969138,"At the end of 1926, when this movie was released, it exploded the box office records not only because of the sensational stars but also due to the dazzling love scenes of Greta Garbo and John Gilbert. The rumor spread from the gossip columnists that they were real life lovers. The publicity was bigger than the movie itself. Clarence Brown who became Garbo s favorite director used the sensationalist story of this movie about a woman desiring only one man (Gilbert) despite she is a married woman.

The Garbo fuse had warmed by her movie ""Torrent (1926)"" and then fanned by the next film ""Temptress (1926),"" and finally reached the might of dynamite with ""Flesh and the Devil."" This is a wonderful pre-code era movie with a lot of ""moral"" issues. Hay's office would have frowned upon this film if this was produced after the codes were in force in 1933.

Greta Garbo paying for her sins by death on a floe is a dramatic moment in this film. She will be on her way in a hurry to stop the duel between her husband (and best friend of John Gilbert) Ulrich, and Leo (John Gilbert) who still loves Garbo. While racing to stop the duel, Felicitas (Garbo) falls through a layer of thin ice and drowns. The two friends realize that that their friendship is more important than Felicitas and reconcile their differences. This movies is based on the play ""The Undying Past"" by Hermann Sudermann, and in 2006, Flesh and the Devil was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".",1420588800,,1588,4.729241877256317

398454,5,6301969138,"This is the TCM release of three of Greta Garbo's silent films,Flesh and the Devil(released Dec/26),The Mysterious Lady(Released Aug/28)and The Temptress(released Oct/26).There is also a 9 minute segment from her Divine Woman feature,considered a(mostly)lost film. All three are melodrama's,the kind your mother always warned you about,typical of the era but overall well done. All three plots involve Garbo as a temptress,or a vamp;luring men to their doom,emotionally and/or physically. Theda Bara was vamping and doing what Garbo was doing more than ten years before. This was just the twenties' new and improved version of those older films. This is ``the woman,no man could resist!``.
The Flesh and the Devil has Garbo as Felicitas. Gilbert meets her at the train station on his way home and is smitten immediately. Next time they meet is at a ball and they swear their undying love for each other. After this they rendezvous at her home,but then the hubby walks in. Gilbert is beside himself. The two men duel and Gilbert wins,killing his opponent. Gilbert is sent away by the Army to Africa to do penance for his crime. He serves three of his five years,each day and hour looking forward to the moment when Felicitas and he could be together.
On his return he is picked up at the train station by his very good friend Ulrich,and his love. His friend was supposed to have taken care of Felicitas for him,but he did better than that and married her. Gilbert is now terribly torn between his love for his Felicitas and his deep friendship for Ulrich. Ulrich goes away on a business trip and the day before he is to return Felicitas repeats her undying love and devotion to Gilbert,and they decide to elope the next day. The next day comes and she is having second thoughts about leaving the good life she has with Ulrich,when her husband arrives home with a fancy bauble. When Ulrich retires to bed Gilbert shows up and asks why Felicitas isn't ready to go. She asks him why they couldn't just stay there and see each other secretly. Gilbert goes over the edge and starts to strangle her. Ulrich walks in on the scene and a duel again rears its ugly head.
The next day on an island where the two men once made a pact of deep friendship,they stand in the snow with pistols at the ready. Felicitas in the meantime has decided to trudge through the cold snow and over the ice covered lake to stop them. Along the way she meets her end when she falls through the ice. It is at that moment that Ulrich has an epiphany and now understands what the circumstances are that has led to these unseemly events. The two men reconnect in their bond of friendship.
The Mysterious Lady stars Conrad Nagel as Capt. Von Raden. He purchases a ticket to an opera and the only other occupant in the box is Garbo. The two immediately fall in love and they spend an idyllic next day in which she professes her love for Nagel. However Nagel's uncle is the head of the secret police and he tells him that Garbo is a Russian spy. He gives Nagel an assignment to take some secret papers to Berlin for him. When next Nagel and Garbo meets he tells her he knows who she is and he rejects her.
On the train to Berlin she is waiting for him in his cabin,knowing what he carries. She tries to persuade him,regarding her love for him,but he is not moved. She leaves and later he discovers the papers have gone also. Nagel is court martialed and imprisoned,but soon his uncle comes to the rescue. He gives Nagel an assignment to exonerate himself;to find the traitor in their midst that has been spilling secrets to the Russians.
Nagel arrives in Warsaw as a pianist. He finds Garbo,who again who expresses her undying love for him. She in fact helps him this time,especially when the Russians have cottoned on to who he really is. Nagel not only finds out who the spy is but retrieves some secret documents. The two flee back to Austria to be married.
The Temptress has Garbo at her vamping best. This time we are in Paris and Antonio Moreno stars as Robledo an engineer/architect. He is at a masquerade ball and meets the alluring Garbo and they fall in love. Next day while visiting his friend he discovers Garbo is his friends wife! Moreno is disgusted and tries to get out of a banquet being thrown by a rich banker at which his friend and wife are attending,but he cannot. At the banquet the host ends up killing himself with poison over Garbo;seems she has snared more than one man before.
Moreno leaves Paris and returns to Argentina where he and some friends are involved in building a dam. His homecoming is something else,as the locals all turn out in fine fashion. One day his Parisian friend shows up unannounced,with Garbo in tow. To add confusion to things already in disarray,a local bandit has been making trouble for the engineers. He shows up after Garbo`s arrival,also smitten with the vamp. Moreno and the bandit end up in a duel with whips,and Garbo couldn't be more excited. Moreno defeats the bandit,but when the bandit tries to shoot Moreno,his Parisian friend takes the bullet and dies. Garbo is now a free woman,and she has her sights set on Moreno more than ever.
Moreno's close friends on the dam project all set their sights on Garbo,much to Moreno``s chagrin and the entire project is in jeopardy. They fight amongst each other and in fact one such fight leads to the death of one of them. At this time the bandit strikes again blowing apart a good portion of the damn. Mostly through Moreno's efforts the dam is saved. But he is a beaten man and collapses at Garbo's feet. He can resist her allure no longer. She finally gets a conscience and leaves Moreno and Argentina for good.
Six years later Moreno returns to Paris and happens to spy Garbo in a small cafe,now an alcoholic and delusional. Moreno can't get through to her who he is,but he leaves her a goodly sum of money secretly. After he leaves she looks at another down and outer at a nearby table and thinks it is Jesus. She pulls out the ring that Moreno gave her that first night at the ball many years before,and gives it to him.
The films are all in varying states of condition,some better than others,but the best I am sure we will most likely ever see. Extras abound on these two discs(one double sided)with such things as the scoring of the films,alternate endings for the Flesh and the Devil and the Temptress,commentary,and photo montages of all three films.
Now as to whether one likes Garbo or not. Many think she is right up there with the Second Coming,but I firmly believe her silents are her best works. From the moment she first uttered a single word with that low,mono toned voice she had,it was curtains as far as I was concerned. And Mayer thought Gilbert had a bad voice for sound....geesh!! It was Garbo,not Gilbert,that should have been tossed to the side,as far as I am concerned. It shows you it is not what you know but who,as Gilbert,the superstar,had fallen out of favour with the mogul and you never got on the wrong side of Mayer and expected to get away with it. Look at Keaton and so many others.
I may not be a Garbo fan of her talkies,but of her silents I think she did some good work in them and you will appreciate these three films TCM presents here as they are three of her best. They are presented in overall good quality for their ages and is a must have for film history buffs and Garbo compleatists/fans alike. Recommended.",1344556800,,7426,4.563295880149813
398455,5,6301969138,"Greta Garbo made twelve major silent films, beginning with the Swedish THE SAGA OF GOSTA BERLINGS in 1924 and ending with three MGM films, THE KISS, WILD ORCHIDS, THE SINGLE STANDARD, in 1929.  With a few exceptions during the VHS era, few of these films have been widely available to the home market.  THE GARBO SILENTS COLLECTIONS offers three, one that Garbo fans have likely seen a dozen times already and two lesser known titles that are equally fine.

The most famous of three, of course, is the 1926 FLESH AND THE DEVIL, Garbo's third film in Hollywood for MGM and her first to co-star her with John Gilbert.  At the time there was no question about who was the bigger star: Gilbert was a huge box office draw and his name is above the title.  According to film lore, Garbo was not eager to make the film.  Her sister had recently died in Sweden and the film's schedule prevented her from being with her family at that time; perhaps more to the point for the ever-practical Garbo, she disliked the role, which she considered ""just another vamp.""  Gilbert, however, was interested in doing a film with Garbo, the studio twisted her arm, and the result was a film with love scenes that were shocking for their day.  Although her previous films had indicated her powers, it was really this film that made her a major star.  It also prompted her love affair with John Gilbert, which would run off and on for many years.  It is also unexpectedly homoerotic.

The story concerns two friends, played by John Gilbert and Lars Hanson, whose attachment seems to be of the hands-on variety: they hug each other, fondle each other, and in general cavort to a point at which one expects them to play a semi-nude love scene at any moment.  But then Garbo tempts Gilbert, who is drawn away from his friend and finds himself caught up in a duel that sends him into exile in Africa.  Upon his return he finds Hanson has married Garbo.  What can he do, torn between the men--er, man and woman--he loves the most?  The ending that resolves the problem is quite unexpected, expecially by standards of the day.  The original ending was so questionable that alternative ending was shot to soften the whole thing and shown in many markets.

Of the other two films, THE TEMPTRESS was made in the same year as FLESH AND THE DEVIL, and it is very likely the film she had in mind when she said her role in FLESH AND THE DEVIL was too much like her earlier films.  In this tale, Garbo plays a woman married to a fop she dislikes--and who falls in love with one of her husband's friends.  One can certainly see the similarity, but the two films are quite different, with Antonio Moreno quite a different type from Gilbert, and the story involving Garbo tricking her husband into helping her pursue Moreno all the way to Argentia, where she does everything from provoke a fight with bull whips to precipitate a murder.  Like FLESH AND THE DEVIL, the conclusion was so completely uncompromising that an alternative ending was shot for markets which couldn't handle the original.

THE MYSTERIOUS LADY was made somewhat later in Garbo's career, in 1928, and it is quite different from the other two films offered here.  In this particular film Garbo is a spy whose interest in Conrad Nagel begins as purely professional but soon progresses into true love.  When Nagel discovers the truth, she declares her love for him--but rejects her and she revenges herself upon him by stealing the top secret papers he carries.  Nagel is subsequently court martialed and drummed out of the army, but he sets out to redeem himself by recovering the papers.  When he once more meets Garbo, he finds that she loves him still--and that she is repentant and willing to help him recover the papers, assuming that neither of them get shot first.  It is an interesting film, very atypical of Garbo's movies, and perhaps all the more fascinating for that.

All three films offer audio tracks of varying interest; FLESH AND THE DEVIL and THE TEMPTRESS include their alternative endings; and there are a number of other tidbits besides.  The visual elements of THE MYSTERIOUS LADY are somewhat weak, but it is no less watchable for that.  Recommended.

398456,4,6301969138,"I really enjoyed this DVD set. Okay, it would have been great if all of Garbo's silent films had been included (especially ""A Woman of Affairs""), but perhaps this is still to come. The films themselves are excellent examples of what it was that made Garbo into the legend she is. As much as I enjoy her later films, for me her strongest performances are those in her silent films. I especially enjoyed the audio commentaries as they give a much deeper insight into the film.

And here the reason why I only rate 4 stars: As much as I enjoyed the audio commentaries of ""The Temptress"" and ""Mysterious Lady"", giving all the background on the actual film usually given in audio commentaries, the commentary I most looked forward to - Barry Paris' of ""Flesh and the Devil"" - I found extremely annoying. Whereas the other two commentaries give valualbe information on the film itself - the main actors involved, the director, lighting, script development, scene development, etc. - Paris' commentary is a mere repetition of the Garbo-Gilbert story and a lot of general stuff from his biography ""Garbo"". I really enjoyed reading the biography and found it very well researched, but when I listen to an audio commentary of ""Flesh and the Devil"", I really would have hoped for a commentary concentrated on the movie itself. And though Mr. Paris might find it amusing to immitate Garbo's accent throughout his commentary, I found it annoying and actually quite disrespectful.

Also, I am wondering a bit about the musical scores. Didn't these movies have their own original score (like ""Woman of Affairs"" or ""Wild Orchids"")? Of course it might be tempting to create new scores, but it would have been nice to have had the original ones as an optional choice.

Still - overall a great DVD set, and I hope that the other Garbo silents will also be released in a set like this!",1315612800,2,1865,4.7323076923076925

MYSTERIOUS LADY is an OK film with a completely unrelated score that sounds like a cheesy Yamaha keyboard demonstration. FLESH AND THE DEVIL is not my cup of tea, but there's quality in the craftsmanship of this film. The extras (montages and documentary) don't contribute much to viewing these films. Running commentary tends to get too scholarly and dry. Price was too good to let go thanks to amazon alerting me to a price drop. Highly recommended.

398459,3,6301969138,"""Flesh and the Devil"" is a seminal film from the mid 20s. It launched many careers and was a box office and critical success.

John Gilbert (1989-1936) stars. He was at the peak of his career when the film was made, coming off successes in ""His Hour"" (1924), ""The Merry Widow"" (1925) and ""The Big Parade"" (1925). Only Valentino rivaled his popularity as a romantic star. Gilbert's career declined in the 30s, partially due to his soured relationship with MGM head Louie Mayer, and Gilbert never managed to make the transition to talkies complete.

Garbo's (1905-90) name appears ""below the line"" along with Lars Hanson. Prior to this Garbo had been in 9 silent films, starting as early as 1920, and mostly in Europe. This was her third American film, for which MGM paid her $450 a week. She followed it with ""Love"" (1927) in which she co-starred with John Gilbert. She was nominated 3 times for an Oscar (""Anna Christie"", ""Camille"", and ""Ninotchka"") but never won. She is listed as #5 on the AFI's list of Greatest Actresses.

Garbo does not appear until 30 minutes into the 2 hour film. Up until this time it is a rather poor comedy, and comedic elements remain even when the heavy melodrama takes over.

Lars Hanson (1886-1965) was a Swedish actor active in the silent era. He made 35 films, most of them foreign. Apart from this film his most notable U.S. film was ""The Scarlett Letter"" (1926) opposite Lillian Gish. His heavy accent meant that he had to return to Europe once films talked.

Barbara Kent (1906) does a great job as the woman child who adores Gilbert, and George Fawcett (1860-1939)performs memorably as the Pastor. Kent appeared in more than 30 films, mostly silent, and is best remembered  for her role in this film and as Rose in ""Oliver Twist"" (1933). Fawcett's stern but malleable face was seen in more than 100 films, mostly silent, with featured roles in such classics as ""Intolerance"" (1916), ""Silas Marner"" (1922), ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles"" (1924) and ""The Merry Widow"" (1925).

Clarence Brown (1890 - 1987) directs. Brown was a well known silent film director (""Last of the Mohicans"", ""The Eagle""). He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times (""Anna Christie"", ""A Free Soul"", ""The Human Comedy"", ""National Velvet"", and ""The Yearling"") but never won. His films earned 38 Oscar nominations and 9 wins, but never for Director. This was his first film with Garbo and they worked together on 5 more films. He loved working with actresses, and also worked with Joan Crawford 6 times.

Williams Daniels (1901-70) is the cinematographer. Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 (""Conquest"", ""Two-faced Woman"") which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim, who was Garbo's favorite director (even though she made 6 films with Brown). Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times (""Anna Christie"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""How the West was Won"") and won once (""Naked City"" in 1948).

Irving Thalberg (1899 - 1936) produced. Known as ""The Boy Wonder"", Thalberg transformed MGM into the powerhouse it became. He sponsored the Marx Brothers as well as films such as ""The Big Parade"" (1925), ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935), ""San Francisco"" (1936), and ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936).

The sets and costumes are lavish, but otherwise the production values are slim. Most of the shots are done in the studio. The special effects of blending painted backdrops with stage action are pretty good

The film opened to critical and commercial success. It propelled the careers of Gilbert and Garbo as well as Brown, Daniels, and Thalberg. Made at a cost of $373,000 the film earned more than $1,000,000.

Known as one of the great romantic films of the silent era, the film is filled with homoerotic imagery which apparently passed for masculine friendship in those days. Nowadays the melodrama appears comical, but for the mid 20s this was common place.",1289952000,,3993,4.830161054172767

It was the first time he saw Garbo and the first time I did. A moment of love at first sight captured in film. From then on Garbo will become a star and we will follow her every gesture.

""Flesh and the Devil"" is a romantic drama about two childhood friends who grow up to be soldiers in Germany. After returning to civilian life, one of the friends, Leo(Gilbert) becomes infatuated with Felicitas (Garbo). A woman who would be the friction in their friendship.

This film is probably one of the most beautifully photograph silent films. There are scenes and shots here that are simply epic. For example as Gilbert and Garbo dance for the first time the camera scrolls up and down with them creating the feeling that we are dancing with them. The scene in the snow is also remarkable with Gilbert standing tall and front but insecure while Garbo is in the background trying to catch up but with a steady step denoting confidence.

That box set includes this exact same set and much more. Occasionally it drops a lot in price and costs about as much as this set currently does. I bought my copy of the Signature Collection elsewhere for much less than this set is currently priced.
I'm pretty sure some used vendors even buy the Signature Collection at a low price separate its contents and sell them individually. I assume that's why the used prices for this are sometimes so low.

398486,5,6301969138,"This is Hollywood and this is Garbo. The only reason to watch the movie is to see her in action: The still close ups of her incredible face, the dramatic poses, the romance of her and Gilbert lighting a cigarette and the tremendous, passionate waltz they dance together which is unforgettable. The plot is  a simple love story set in Germany, which is a perfect excuse for her to be  Countess Felicitas von Rhaden, and her love interest Leo von Harden to wear fabulous uniforms, and the story to have a gay sub-plot.
In reality there are two love triangles: The first is Felicitas-the Count-Leo, the second is Leo-Felicitas-Ulrich. When Leo returns from being away for a few years after he has dueled with the Count (Marc McDermot) he finds out she has married his best friend since childhood, Ulrich Von Eltz (Lars Hanson), at the train station, they did not have the heart to tell him before. It is not too long before Felicitas drags Leo into a revived fatal attraction and starts making all of their lives a complete mess.
She is always well dressed though, and whether wearing a widow's hat with a veil, or a simple dress and a fox she is always the living image of glamour. The two men had an ongoing relationship even before she arrives on the scene, as their whole relationship in military school very much points in that direction. It should have its own entry under ""Closet relationships and celluloid censorship in America"" which is the ongoing encyclopedia of repression of sexuality in Holywood, with several volumes of gay material disguised, twisted, hidden and implied in Holywood productions since the silents till today. They after all, have been 'blood brothers' since childhood when they swore eternal friendship at a Grecian pavillion in the middle of this lovely island of Friendship, in front  of the gayest statue I have ever seen on film, featuring two half nude male athletes, in a semi embracing position, which is the stamp on the gay passport.
Although the story is hard to follow (there were two writers involved), the director, Clarence Brown makes an effort at making it all look good. There are  great angle shots aplenty. In a close up of Felicitas and Leo lying together she is wearing a top that looks like material from a Klimt painting, the lighting of her face at the train station is a great moment, as also when she looks happily at herself with a black veil in a mirror after her husband's demise and we understand that she is appreciating him so much more now that he has become a fashion accessory. The scene of the duel is another great highlight totally shot in silhouette, which is beautifully effective and magical.
A must see for all those interested in Garbo's career as this is one of her finest performances. Had she done this movie with Valentino it would have broken all records in profits and would have remained the classic romance forever.",1250467200,2,2896,4.717391304347826
398487,5,6301969138,"If you're not familiar with Garbo, start here, because this is a great introduction. All three feature films include commentary that is insightful and stays on track. The commenters do not meander off into side issues as is often the case.

In both cases, they are not giving you the absolute best that the artist did, but are trying to give you a sample of their works with one extremely good film (in this case ""The Flesh and the Devil"").

""The Temptress"" is the film that I liked the least. Made before ""Flesh and the Devil"", you may be slightly annoyed that Garbo is not as much the center of attention that she is in the other two. ""Flesh and the Devil"" is of course the center attraction here, with this being the beginning of the Garbo/Gilbert collaboration that was so successful onscreen. Finally, there is 1928's ""The Mysterious Lady"" made as the silent era was waning with Garbo starring opposite Conrad Nagel.

I would still like to see another set of Garbo silents, since there is so much good work still out there that she did at MGM that is not on DVD - A Woman of Affairs, The Single Standard, Wild Orchids, and The Kiss come to mind. It is somewhat ironic that one of the extras in the set is a featurette on TCM's Young Composers Contest. This is a competition in which young musicians score part of a silent film and the winner goes on to score an entire silent film in the TCM library that is then premiered on TCM. That competition has now been eliminated, and is one of the reasons that Warner Home Video has not releasing any more silents. Releasing the films I mentioned would bypass that problem since they were all made with a Movietone score and synchronous sound effects, something that was popular in the non-dialogue films released in 1928 and 1929.",1227916800,2,3061,5.548179871520342

This imperfect restoration does not affect your viewing but is just sad to see how dirty this film is compared to the others. None the less, it is actually younger than the previous two.

I loved this collection and is worth every penny. It is also worth every penny if you're a Pre-Code movie lover (like myself) because all of these, especially Flesh and the Devil, seem very scandalous.",1224547200,,690,4.52
398489,5,6301969138,"This beautiful story of fallen love from director Clarence Brown is given a romantic glow seldom seen in sound pictures. Garbo's magic, only occasionally seen in her sound films, is gloriously displayed here by photographer William Daniels. John Gilbert's charisma is also shown to great advantage, giving those who never saw him an explanation for his huge popularity during the silent era.

There is more story than usual is this lush and romantically told tale of forbidden love that just won't die and the long friendship it threatens. Based on Hermann Sudermann's novel, ""The Undying Past,"" Benjamin F. Glazer's screenplay doesn't really seem that dated even today. The settings arranged by Cedric Gibbons and Frederic Hope make this fabulous production from MGM one of Garbo's finest films.

Leo von Harden (John Gilbert) and Ulrich (Lars Hanson) are military men whose bond runs deep and far, all the way back to childhood when they became blood-brothers in the presence of Ulrich's little sister Hertha (Barbara Kent) on the ""Isle of Friendship."" When as young men they return home, Leo sees for the first time the woman who will perhaps destroy not only that friendship, but Leo himself.

Garbo is the image of romance stepping off the train in her first screen moments. It is not long after at a ball that the two meet again, the white rose exchanged at their first meeting in hand. The scenes that follow are some of the most romantic in screen history. William Daniels frames Garbo's Felicitas in matchlight and moonlight beneath an arbor as one of the most romantic build-ups to a screen kiss takes place.

The shots of Garbo and Gilbert that follow are justly legendary. Though fully clothed, there is an oozing afterglow of implied intimacy that can almost be felt by the viewer. The scenes are filled with romance which takes a sudden and dark turn when the husband Felicity did not inform Leo of finds them together. A duel incurs in which Leo prevails, but only the Pastor knows the real reason for the tragedy.

Garbo's scenes picking out the right veil to mourn in shows the viewer all that Leo can not see with his eyes. He will have to spend five lonely years in Africa before he can return to her so they may be together. He implores his friend for life, Ulrich, to watch after her until he returns. He will not realize what a mistake it was until he returns and finds the two married, Ulrich being unaware of their prior love, and unable to resist her charms.

Barbara Kent is terrific as the grown Hertha, whose crush on Leo as a child has turned into an abiding love ignored by a brooding Leo. Felicitas begs him to reconcile with his friend but her motives are not pure like the white rose and soon temptation will overcome them. What follows cannot be revealed to the viewer but you will not see the ending of this romantic drama coming in any way.

Garbo and Gilbert were actually in love here, and it comes across in every scene. It is ironic that the haze of Garbo's spell cast over Gilbert in real life would destroy him nearly to the same degree as Mayer did when sound came along. This is a beautiful and romantic film with a lush and lovely glow you will not find anywhere else. Watch Garbo and Gilbert by firelight some rainy night with someone you love. It is an unforgettable film experience.",1219104000,2,3330,4.653061224489796
398490,2,6301969138,"I DON""T MIND THE CRITICISM--but instead of JUST piling up ""unhelpful"" votes for this review--why don't you write one of your own? Very few people read the comments, compared to the number of those who read reviews. This review fairly DRIPS with sarcasm (my take on the movie); tell people how wonderful it is, if that's the way you feel!

The only reason to watch this movie are some fairly sizzling scenes between Gilbert and Garbo. But this is a movie about...friendship. Otherwise: Garbo keeps looking out of the top of her eyes, and the man she marries constantly looks as if his eyes were propped open with toothpicks. In spite of the fact that the friendship between the to men is RAMMED down your throat (for instance, the vaguely Greek statue on Friendship Island where the two boys become ""blood brothers,"" and where the movie ends), perhaps because of the overkill, I didn't believe it, and I didn't care, either. At the end of the film, after the Garbo character has proven herself to be thoroughly reprehensible--and then falls through the ice and drowns (unlike Liza in Uncle Tom's Cabin), the two men, instead of shooting eachother in a duel (yeah), fall into eachothers' arms (gingerly).

You don't believe a word of this, and I imagine the alternate ending (someone thought the movie seemed to imply a same-sex romantic relationship...lots of luck) in which one of the men goes home and marries the other's sister, is probably no better than the original.

I've seen enough silent movies to know that they don't have to be ridiculous. Suggestions: ""Wings"" (1927), ""Sunrise"" (1927), ""The Last Laugh,"" ""Nosferatu,"" ""Berlin: Symphony of the Big City,"" ""The Passion of Joan of Arc,"" and leave us not forget ""Birth of a Nation,"" and ""The Battleship Potemkin,"" ""Nightmail"" (a documentary on the mailtrain run between London and Edenborough--with poetry by Auden!--oh, sorry: that's not silent!) But if you really want love and/or friendship--the first two I mentioned.

Sorry, but I really found this movie pretty appalling.",1215475200,,2034,4.973529411764706
398491,5,6301969138,"Superficially, this is the so-so love triangle talked about too much.  However, taking the sub-texts and the subconscious minds of the story, it perverts the obedient old high society.

If the sliding knife on the hands of two young boys in front of a girl as a ritual to the ""brotherhood"" signifies the abiding homosexuality doesn't horrify you enough, the unending Greta's rolling love between the two men leading to death of her own sinking self surely would. There are a lot of subtle shots like this gesturing the sub-texts everywhere. This looks like a psychoanalysis paper of the love-oppressed.

Greta Garbo performed Countess Felicitas, good luck in the ancient Roman mythology, criss-crossed among men leading them to gun-duel for her. Leo killed the Count for his indulgence in Felicitas.  Ulrich then took care of Felicitas and married her while Leo served his sentence away in South Africa.  With Pastor acting the religious sentence, the fate of the love is sealed.  The ""brotherhood"" finally ""won"" in the end as they stopped the duel back on the island where they gave their oath to each other. While the two ""boys"" legs are deep in the snow, it seems to suggest their love is pure and blessed.

This is ""the"" avant garde movie, silent in black and white, that is so farward to its time.  Symbolic, liberal, and Europeanized, this is no place like France, but America MGM. I think every moviegoers should see this film and revive the golden years that movies once were.  A highly recommended feature film.",1198627200,,1520,4.8604651162790695
398492,5,6301969138,"Remembrance of things past is an important part of history and surely silent movies are among our glorious past. The famed onstage and offstage romance between two colossal characters - Greta Garbo and John Gilbert - is electrifying, all the moreso because the lack of dialogue illuminates their breathtakingly dramatic body language.

Each artistically framed B&W shot illuminates the unquenchable and deadly passion between the duo, who, in real life, are from Stockholm and Utah. While the viewer may be rooting for Virtue to win - or even make a token appearance - the Devil is firmly in charge, in this always suspenseful, unpredictable flick made in 1927 when Garbo was all of 22 and her co-star 27.

The final scenes of icy grandeur are haunting. No wonder Garbo (1905-90) insisted that this same cinematographer film her during much of her career. She was a woman who, during the studio system, controlled much of her own destiny. You'll see why when you see her, even in silence, a woman described by many, including famed poet Wallace Stevens, as the most striking woman to light up a screen.",1161475200,,1102,4.887700534759358
7818832,5,6301969138,"The walk.  Hips forward, back slightly hunched, incredibly sexy.  That face.  Those eyes.  She never again looks as beautiful as she does in this movie. Maybe because it's her first Hollywood movie and they hadn't had a chance to mold her yet.  (Or fix her teeth).

The plot is corny and the characters ridiculous and over-the-top, but it's still my favorite Garbo pic.  And knowing that she is falling in love with her co-star, John Gilbert (or he's falling in love with her at least), makes it even sweeter.",1517011200,,509,4.651685393258427
7818833,4,6301969138,"Part of a set of three Garbo films, Flesh and the Devil is a good print with a really outstanding score by Carl Davis. The biggest drawback, if there is one, is that the film moves from high comedy touched with whimsy at the beginning to heavy melodrama at the end.

Brace for emotional whiplash.

Two lifelong friends Leo and Ulrich (John Gilbert, Lars Hanson) become separated by the alluring Felicitas (Greta Garbo). Leo loves her first and asks her to wait for him, which she agrees to, yet upon returning from service in Africa - with nothing but Felicitas on his mind - whose memory sustained him through those long, weary years ..... Leo arrives home, at last, only to see ....

The downside is Felicitas is not happily married to kind, gentle, loving, giving Ulrich. She still lusts for Leo. Leo, on the other hand, is loved by pure, chaste Hertha (Barbara Kent) Ulrich's sister. This messy quadrangle allows Garbo much opportunity to emote immensely as she strives mightily to overcome the hurdles she, and only she herself, has put in her way.

The ending is over the top but moved this specific viewer to genuine tears. And the highest compliment I can pay to any art form, be it music, writing, film, whatever, is to get so drawn in as to let down my guard.",1498521600,2,1269,4.552631578947368
7818834,4,6301969138,"my 4-star rating is a compromise - greta's potent 5-star presence has often been undermined by her movies - even those films considered her best have never risen to the top of my favorites - but if you've never seen these films (and can enjoy silent films) - these are worth seeing at least once

if you've never seen garbo in her early years in hollywood - prepare yourself - the 20 year old that appeared in The Temptress was as stunning as she could be - it would be a few more years before her face hardened into a mask - but that was mostly seen in her photos - in movies - she was still nubile beneath the chiseled on pancake

you might consider seeing the movies in their release order - The Temptress - Flesh and the Devil - The Mysterious Lady - just to experience what the audiences of the day experienced

the quality of the film is generally pretty good - there is some deterioration on all - strangely the later film (The Mysterious Lady) has some bad deterioration in spots - but not enuf to get in the way of the fan

the film commentaries that accompany each one aren't the best - but they are informative if you don't know her history - with silent films you can watch the film while listening to the commentary at first viewing - tho of course the commentary may give parts of the story away

for garbo fans who don't have these films - this is worth considering - for newcomers - this is worth renting first - but be warned - dat svedish gurl is a temptress like no other",1495756800,,1490,4.2140350877192985

There is a beautiful Carl Davis score added, which bumps the movie up a couple of notches for today's audiences.

Lots of romance and drama among the trio of two lifelong friends and the woman who enters their lives.  Garbo as Felicitas is wiser in the ways of the world than the two idealistic soldiers--especially John Gilbert as Leo. There is plenty of room for tragedy and redemption.",1482969600,,573,4.653465346534653
