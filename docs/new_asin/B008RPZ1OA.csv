8530093,4,B008RPZ1OA,"I purchased this DVD because I personally know one of the actors and was interested for that reason. After viewing it and because of its meaningful message for all, I plan to give my copy to a friend. Short enough to watch easily with a powerful message that makes you think about life and there's more than one message if you watch and listen closely. I hope Smart Dog Films continues this story with a follow up movie. I found the interview with the actual couple the movie was based on which played at the end of the DVD especially touching. A nice extra piece for a film based on a real life story. This DVD would make a great little gift for a lot of reasons and the price is right!",1345852800,3,687,4.212121212121212
