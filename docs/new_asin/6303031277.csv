536277,5,6303031277,John Williams is original because he doesn't play for the late Segovia.  Instead he plays for the composer of the piece.  The second half of the video portrays Williams as a yuppie sheltered from society.  More playing  could have prevented that impression.  The video contains a great variety  of pieces ranging from Japan to Cordoba Spain.  One must understand that  his flawless playing is from countless hours of practice.  Yngwie Malmsteen  and John share one trait-the denial of dedication and lengthy practice  sessions.,955929600,3,527,5.228915662650603
536278,5,6303031277,"This Video is not for the Guitarist wanna-be.  Be warned, if you watch this video, you may never feel worthy to pick up a guitar again.  He's a Master and we can't even touch his tuning pegs.  The best collection of  vurtuosity I have ever seen.",946166400,5,245,4.260869565217392
536279,4,6303031277,"This man is truely a gift to the world of the classical guitar. His technique is so flawless, and he economizes finger motion so effectively, that the music appears to flow without effort. The reason I olny rated this  video with 4 stars was due to the decision of the film maker to cut away to  scenery at pivotal points in many of the works. While the scenery is  striking, anyone wishing to observe the master's technique will be quite  perturbed-as I was. None the less, a phenomenal video. (Don't forget to  watch the documentary after the concert!)",931651200,7,554,4.612244897959184
536280,5,6303031277,"I cannot believe how this guy plays... it seems effortlestly.  As for the video, it is well done with lots of variations on the type of music he plays.  If you are a serious guitar player, you should watch this video for  inspiration.  John Williams will inspire you.",927676800,5,267,4.5
7834855,5,6303031277,"Excellent ""concert"" backed with an intimate profile of guitarist John Williams. I've seen Williams twice now, and I greatly admire his sense of purity, lack of exhibitionism, and startling technique. His concerts were so perfect, and I've never seen anyone look so right with a guitar. View and testify!",1177113600,,303,5.204081632653061
7834856,5,6303031277,"Why this title has got 5-star rating is quite no doubt.  In 1995, I bought that Seville Concert in LD format.  I went to Singapore last August (2004) and found that title, in DVD format, at both the Boulder bookstore, at Orchard Road, and the HMV music store (Capital Theatre & Building branch), at North Bridge Road. The price is about SG$ 40-45 (around US$ 25-28), tax excluded. I bought one.

The disc is provided by Sony Classical and distributed by Sony Music Asia. The catalog number is SVD 53475. It is all-zone (playable anywhere without region-code restriction), NTSC (compatible with US TV broadcasting system), 118.59 minutes length. It bears a bar code ""4 893391 105890"". I believe that this disc is made in Germany.  The main difference between DVD format and LD format is that the DVD starts with the Seville Concert, while the LD starts with the Film Profile (documentary that shows JW 's playing techniques and life style. The only flaw I found is that, unlike LD, there is no chapter selection offered for the part of the Film Profile.  That means you can only fast forward if you want to search for some contents. You can't use the skip button on your remote control or your player.

I hope this title will be offered as DVD format in the USA soon.",1095897600,9,1266,4.604444444444445
7834857,4,6303031277,"Mr Williams plays his stock and trade without flaw. Its about time a serious video was made to display this brilliance.
Only two gripes,
The sound quality on the second half of the video is almost criminal, poor recording or mastering makes for pea soup.
secondly, can you stomach watching John look cold and disinterested for this whole video? He may be robot perfect, but Romero or Bream could teach him a thing or two about music and emotion",1062028800,,444,4.632911392405063
7834858,5,6303031277,John Williams as we want to see him. I have the Laser Disk edition of this wonderful video but the disk is 20 years old and time has destroyed it. I hope Sony will release it in DVD in the near future. I am sure there is a great market for it.,1050796800,,243,3.6923076923076925
7834859,5,6303031277,"John Williams has created one of the most beautiful and educational music videos of all time.  Filmed at the Palacio Alcazar in Seville, Spain, surrounded by beautiful moorish architecture and quaint interior patios with lovely gardens and fountains, transfers the viewer into another world.  If you've never seen Williams perform in person, then please purchase this video in order to witness his perfect technique and style.",1032912000,4,426,5.4393939393939394
7834860,5,6303031277,I am rather new to the classical guitar world.  I think that this video is great.  Not only do they show William's hands plenty but I think that the scenery adds to the wonderful music.  The profile of him after the concert is worth the price of the video alone.  You just can't lose if you purchase this video.  I think it is a great buy.,1032134400,2,339,4.075757575757576
7834861,5,6303031277,"John Williams plays fantastic musics. He makes guitar music so beautiful and so marvelous. In this album, especially the profile part, I saw John's passion for guitar and how he trnscribe musics. As a fan of John Williams, you can't miss this album.",1007251200,,249,4.813953488372093
7834862,4,6303031277,"Really terrific video.  The selections are representative of the classic Spanish repertoire.  Of course, Williams is fantastic.  The production values are high.
If watching this master guitarist playing weren't enough, the video includes a full bio on Williams.  This was almost as engrossing as his playing, as one gets a rare glimpse into the life an extraordinary guitarist.  Williams excitement as he talks about his own favorite players and composers is the best commentary on his approach.
My only reasons for less than a five star rating:
1) As Williams plays, the camera spends much of the time on his surroundings which, while often quite serene and always beautiful, robs the viewer of the opportunity to see Williams' technique.  For a both the aspiring and accomplished guitarist, the video soars when the camera lights on Williams fingers.
2) DVD.  The ability to instantly cue up a specific performance would have significantly enhanced this video.
The absolute beauty of Williams approach to the guitar, however, and it's ocassional didactic value, is enough for me to lovingly lug my clunky VHS tape for as long as I tote my guitar.",1001462400,4,1148,5.074468085106383
7834863,5,6303031277,"...[I] think this video was worth it. The program selected for the first half of the video is great, featuring spanish classics like Albeniz' Asturias and Sevilla and and the Adagio from Rodrigo's concierto de aranjuez, to a piece called Sakura Variations written by a living Japanese composer named Toru Takemitsu. Absolutely nothing is left to be desired in Mr Williams' playing. His technique is flawless as someone else wrote and musicality spectacular, although he can get a little boring to watch. Direction of the film is good. Camera angles are usually interesting which make John's dullness a little less obvious. Scenery is sometimes shown (usually at the begginings of the pieces) and can be a little annoying but the scenery is beautiful and it doesn't last long so who cares. The second half of the film which is a profile on John is worth the money alone. It includes tidbits of John in recital or just playing and allows John to share his opinions and let us get to know him. I found out somethingn interesting.... Anyway, highly recommended!",999043200,,1057,4.877777777777778
7834864,5,6303031277,I don't have enough superlatives to describe this video. I'll just say that I ordered two extras to give to friends. There should be more like  this of other great guitarists also.,968976000,2,180,4.625
