8491142,1,B00007JZYG,"I think I found a winner for the most boring film of the year or maybe of all time: Looking through Lillian.  This film is about a prostitute who services an old guy and she decides to get out of the trade.  This film is 90 minutes of totally inept dialogue, amateurish acting and a total lack of direction.  It almost seems like the actors slipped away from their day jobs during lunch to quickly make this film, and then go back to their day jobs.  Poor production qualities all around, I really don't recommend this film at all, in fact, I recommend to stay away from it at all costs.",1123632000,3,587,4.261261261261262
8491143,1,B00007JZYG,"This movie has to be the most boring movie that I have seen....absolutely no plot and cannot hold a viewers attention.  Thank goodness for fast forward!

Don't waste you time on this one.....can cause impotency as well.",1109894400,,219,4.891891891891892
8491144,4,B00007JZYG,"Lillian (Jade Henham) earns her keep playing mistress to wealthy married businessman Sam Bottoms. But when a stranger unexpectedly enters her life, she's forced to reevaluate her lifestyle. Sound cliche'? Believe me, it's not! First time director Jake Torem and co-writer Henham take what could have been a standard ""girl caught up in circumstances beyond her control"" story and focus on the characters. The surprising thing is that whenever the story pulls a surprise (and there are a few)it feels justified because the characters are so well drawn out. Director Torem is to be commended for maintaing a difficult balancing act of the film's subject matter without spiraling down into the kind of distracting self-indulgence that a Lynch or Tarantino would. Erotic, endearing without being sappy, and very well directed, LOOKING THROUGH LILLIAN is a rare gem of a film you won't want to miss.
The DVD has Deleted Scenes and Audio Commentary by Torem and Henham with a film critic. The behind the scenes stuff is as good as the movie (your jaw will hit the floor when you find out the film's budget and shooting schedule).
LOOKING THROUGH LILLIAN won 1st Place at the Houston Film Festival a few years back. Pick up this disc and you'll see why.",1070928000,3,1245,4.9052132701421804
