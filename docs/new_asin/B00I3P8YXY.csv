8638755,5,B00I3P8YXY,"This DVD fits perfectly with all my other FOP DVDs,and I love how they all look on my shelf! I already had the fairly odd parents season 6 volumes 1&2, plus the season 6 collectors edition (which for some reason didn't contain all the episodes from season 6) so I'm really glad nickelodeon finally released a complete season set! There's no special features, but I expect that from these kinds of DVDs. I also don't like how the DVDs are arranged to overlap with each other. But overall a good DVD set, I hope to see more FOP DVDs for sell in the future!",1483660800,3,554,4.336538461538462

8638759,4,B00I3P8YXY,"Okay, this might have gotten a higher rating, but there was a problem.  It's a blatant rip off of FOP fans. Why? Because, back in 2009/2010, Volume 1 of this DVD was released commercially, but Volume 2 never was. I purchased Volume 1 and waited in vain for Vol. 2. This resulted in me having to order a DVD set that had many of the episodes I already had.  However, in order to get the episodes I did not have, I was forced to get this.  So congratulations Nickelodeon, you made money off of me twice from something I already had. Nonetheless, the episodes are very enjoyable and the quality of picture and sound is great.  And unlike the commercial release, it is in production order.  In short, 4 stars because I enjoyed the episodes but it would have been five stars, if I hadn't felt I'd been cheated by the producers of FOP",1442966400,3,828,4.35064935064935
8638760,5,B00I3P8YXY,Loved it I enjoyed it very much thanks,1439769600,,38,3.875
8638761,4,B00I3P8YXY,"I love the fact that Nickelodeon and Amazon hasn't given up on the people that actually like to physically own their DVD's. digital is OK but it has too many variables - ""Am I connected, is my connection fast enough, what if I don't want an ISP because I use Amazon or Hulu, etc. The younger generation needs to know what it's like to truly own something without continually paying for it. So thank you Amazon and Nick, me and my kids truly enjoy owning this cartoon and many more in the future.",1430352000,3,495,4.333333333333333
