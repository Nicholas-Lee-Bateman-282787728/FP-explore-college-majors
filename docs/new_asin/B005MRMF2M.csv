4836634,5,B005MRMF2M,"Written and performed by Colin Quinn.  Directed by Jerry Seinfeld.  This show was so well done and so funny, I saw it Live twice at Bleeker St. Theatre.  It was so well received it moved uptown to Helen Hayes Theatre in Times Square where I saw it again.  Hilarious view of civilization.  Highly recommend.  Deserves a Tony, if there is a Comedy category.  Glad it was made into a DVD.",1325635200,11,385,4.414285714285715
4836635,5,B005MRMF2M,"This is a hilarious, smart summary of the history of the world. Colin Quinn is largely accurate (I did notice a historical error on the Latin America piece) and wholly entertaining. I only wish there was an edited version I could show my world history students, as the curse words are free flowing. I can watch this repeatedly and still laugh heartily at Quinn's performance. I HIGHLY recommend this product!",1323302400,8,408,4.8428571428571425
4836636,5,B005MRMF2M,My wife talked me into seeing this when he came to philly. i wasn't too sure but i'm glad i did. it took about 5 minutes to get going but when he did it just took off. my only regret is that i didn't bring paper and a pen to write down all the jokes that i wanted to repeat later to friends and family. i cant wait to get this in the mail so i can see it all over again,1323129600,12,369,3.5121951219512195
4836637,4,B005MRMF2M,Very funny take on modern history. One of his methods is to play the European countries and others of the world as a person leading to one of my favorite bits where all the countries are leaving a bar at 3 in the morning; hilarity ensues.,1477353600,,238,4.195652173913044
4836638,5,B005MRMF2M,Yes. I love this and watch it a lot.,1473206400,,36,3.111111111111111
4836639,5,B005MRMF2M,Possibly the best one-man show of all time.  Saw it first with the family on Broadway and then many times since on DVD.  I particularly enjoy seeing it again with people seeing it for the first time.  I've given it to many people and these copies are just two more to give away when the right person comes along.  A history of the world in 75 minutes!  Who could ask for more?!,1463011200,,377,4.180555555555555

4836642,5,B005MRMF2M,"I saw this live a few years ago and had to have the DVD, as well.  Colin Quinn is very talented at performing this one-man show that summarizes significant historical occurrence's in a very entertaining way.  While humorous, his portrayal is also thought provoking.  I recently purchased his book on race relations - another splendid portrayal of these issues in a provocative way.",1454198400,,381,5.015873015873016
4836643,5,B005MRMF2M,Colin is hysterical.  This DVD is worth it if you haven't seen his take on the history of the world.  Catch him live if you have the chance.,1452902400,,140,3.9642857142857144

4836652,5,B005MRMF2M,Colin Quinn nails each country's personality as if it were an individual and brings us home to where we as a country are today. Hilarious yet poignant and right on. Just the right length to hold you the whole way.,1410739200,,213,4.35

4836654,5,B005MRMF2M,"One time, I was getting into a cab in New York City and Colin Quinn came lumbering down the street in a long grey trenchcoat, smiling and saying hi to those who greeted him. ""Hey Col, love your stuff!"" yelled a kindly doorman. ""Hey buddy, lemme shake your hand,"" said a buff, tight-tee-shirted guido from Jersey. I tapped Quinn on the arm and said: ""Keep up the good work!"" He was not creeped out by this at all. In fact, Quinn seemed genuinely pleased to have fans and to interact with them. What can I say: he seemed like a likable, genuine sort of dude. In this great one-man show produced by none other than Maestro Jerry Seinfeld, Quinn is the history professor I always wish I'd had. Not some stuffy, bow-tied milquetoast with a fetish for total recall of exact days/months/years and ""Top 3 causes of the Reformation"", but a guy who just gets it, who tells it like it is. Quinn's comedy plays just-loose-enough with the facts so that you can appreciate the capital ""T"" Truth behind those facts. Don't just watch this on YouTube for free. Buy it. Be nice to the artist. He is a genial, middle-aged man.",1406505600,,1107,4.485148514851486
4836655,5,B005MRMF2M,Very good humor and an easy way to understand how civilizations came to be.,1406073600,,75,4.428571428571429
4836656,5,B005MRMF2M,This was a fun look at human history.  With all humor there is that serious look though at the human condition.  This was well done and thought provoking.,1402790400,,154,4.464285714285714
4836657,5,B005MRMF2M,This show is hilarious and intelligent .  It appeals to the history buff in me.  I first saw it on HBO and HAD to own it!! I've watched it numerous time and it never fails to satisfy.,1400198400,,183,3.918918918918919
4836658,5,B005MRMF2M,"I think this guy is a genius! WHERE has he BEEN all this time???!!!
  Colin Quinn wrote the whole show and manages to poke fun at everyone without being cruel -  hard for some comedians to do. He gives you a history of the world, more or less, with lots of diversions on the side to showcase our funniest fears, humiliations, and neuroses. The show is so densely packed that you have to watch it over and over to get everything - thus, you need to own the DVD.
  I don't often pass on DVDs, CDs, or books, but this one I've sent to all my friends. Colin Quinn is also good at foreign accents and zeroing in on stereotypes we love to have about not only foreigners, friends, and family, but ourselves. It's truly amazing that you can watch 75 minutes of this man's snide-ness and feel great about having done so!
  I'm looking forward to the DVD of his next show called, ""Unconstitutional,"" in which I believe he tells us all about our illustrious fondled Fathers...",1393027200,,965,4.387640449438202
4836659,5,B005MRMF2M,Great DVD. Gotta love Colin Quinn. He makes history fun. Add Jerry Seinfeld to the mix and it's the perfect formula!!!,1390003200,,118,4.666666666666667
4836660,5,B005MRMF2M,One of the best comics out today! Great interpretation of world history... A subject I otherwise wouldn't give a care about!,1388620800,,124,4.9523809523809526
4836661,5,B005MRMF2M,This special is really funny! I enjoyed it. I think his metaphors for history & empires are so entertaining. Filler,1386806400,,115,4.8
4836662,5,B005MRMF2M,"where has CQ been since his mtv days?  where ever it was i'm glad he's back!  a brilliant, comedic world view.",1385424000,,110,4.190476190476191
4836663,5,B005MRMF2M,"Colin Quinn's Long Story Short is spectacularly funny. His wit on our history is extremely well said and can't help but make you go ""Yeah...thats what happened."" The dvd works perfectly as soon as it arrived--a bit slow, but I'm sure there was a valid reason for the delay--and had no skips, no markings on the disk and the box on the outside was still intact. If you haven't watched it yet, check it out on Netflix or tune in on HBO, as I'm sure they'll have it playing over and over again.",1379980800,,491,4.290322580645161
4836664,4,B005MRMF2M,"Colin Quinn has decades of experience in comedy, including Saturday Night Live, which seems to be the prerequisite for any successful comedian. This is a filmed version of his one-man show about the history of uncivil civilization, from a nod to prehistoric times through the Greeks and Romans, the British and Russians, side trips to Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and the entire Western Hemisphere. Along the way, he skewers politics, religion and culture. Interestingly, he ties up the program very clearly and only afterward did I realize how intelligently he put this show together. It is not a set of jokes and one-liners, but a cohesive narrative which is broken into bite-sized bits that are hysterically funny. Quinn is not only highly entertaining in the subject matter, but he does wonderful caricatures and accents in his presentation. I had to take off 1 star, however, because religious people might find parts of the show edgy rather than funny. He doesn't pick on any one religion but jabs at all of them. My favorite part of the show actually had nothing to do with politics or religion: there was an aside on how we treat the elderly and he suggests that Early Bird Specials were designed so we wouldn't have to watch old people eat. I watched this DVD with my mother, who is in her late 80s, and she thought it was hilarious, right down to the little fruit cup. As for me, I laughed until I choked.",1377302400,,1420,4.684
4836665,5,B005MRMF2M,"The foundation to this piercingly funny show would have to be the connections CQ makes - Julius Caesar as the ultimate GoodFella, the Silk Road trade route as a forerunner of radio, England as France's 100 Years sulking, would-be  lover.  CQ's timing and delivery are up to the level of this very, very funny / witty material.  He kind of looks out at us like a brilliant but pugnacious kid, his eyes wide and his palms at his sides as if to say, ""Look, I don't WANT to have to be the one to tell you these things....""  (Maybe being a New Yorker helps in this regard.)  My only disappointment is not being a zillionaire...if I were I would glady underwrite his idea / template for an Idealistic White Teacher in the Inner City movie; his jokey version sounds better than the real films in that genre.  The whole performance was just excellent.",1370131200,,843,4.477124183006536
4836666,5,B005MRMF2M,"I would have ordered a dozen to give to hip persons.

4836667,5,B005MRMF2M,"Saw this special on HBO and it's very funny.  My son loved it too and has wanted to share it with friends so we purchased it.  Quirky view of world history, lots of laughs.",1369094400,,172,4.029411764705882
4836668,5,B005MRMF2M,I saw this first on HBO and knew I had to add it to my collection. This is so entertaining and Colin Quinn is fun to watch. I laughed the whole time!,1369008000,,149,3.6875
4836669,5,B005MRMF2M,"I cannot say enough about what I can only call the Genius of this work.  The only down side about the project is that I would feel sorry for any comedian ever trying to top himself with this work!  I say that kiddingly, of course, but Colin Quinn does such an amazing job here that I don't know how he ever could top it.  It is intelligent and HYSTERICAL from beginning to end.  I enjoyed every single second of it.",1366156800,,415,4.15
4836670,5,B005MRMF2M,"A really fun trip through 4,000 years of history. It is Saturday Night Live for the History Channel. Colin Quinn delivers his lines flawlessly. There are pretty much no sacred cows in his stories. I wouldn't plan for kids to watch it. Funny but not PG.",1364169600,,252,4.5
4836671,5,B005MRMF2M,"Colin Quinn is arguably the greatest comic working today. This show is the culmination of all of his hard work and comic brilliance. Often dismissed as a has-been from his Remote Control days and Tough Crowd (hugely underrated and misunderstood show he hosted on Comedy Central; unique in every way), Long Story Short was his redemption. He started out in underground theater and then transferred it to Broadway with big production values (for a one-man show). Colin's grasp on various specific accents is incredible, not the typical, stock voices comics do to mimic certain races and ethnicities.

8479688,4,B005MRMF2M,"Wasn't sure I was going to like this video. I'm somewhat familiar with Colin Quinn's style of comedy, but this one-man show seemed to be something else. Turned out to be worth watching, his dry wit actually worked well with this sort of intellectual stand up. After watching it I saw that Jerry Seinfeld was the producer and I could imagine this would have been the sort of thing he would help create.

If I were to have a complaint, it would be that the presentation seemed a bit too short. I wanted more. I watched the video again later and listen to the commentary track with Colin & Jerry discussing the production (and other things). There is also a short (15 min) behind the scenes feature.

I'm glad I picked this video up for my collection.",1491696000,,748,4.452554744525547
