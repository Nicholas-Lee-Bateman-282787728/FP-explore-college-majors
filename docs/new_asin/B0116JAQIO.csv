8723692,4,B0116JAQIO,"An interesting overview of the festival and the time in which it was staged 1969. Unlike  some other documentaries it does look at some of the worst aspects of the event, for example we see the name and picture of the young boy run over and killed by mistake by a pick up truck running over his sleeping bag. And an ABC reporter tells us of the dozens of kids he saw ""having bad drug trips in a tent believe me you have not seen anything until you have seen that"" ! And as David Crosby points out corporate America woke up to the vast sums of money that could be made in rock n roll after seeing headlines of the event . So a more balanced report on the festival that the puff pieces you usually get on it.",1519862400,,706,4.042857142857143
8723693,3,B0116JAQIO,"This DVD contains a 1994 documentary of some of the behind the scene activities, and also interviews with several original 1969 concert goers, band members and organizers. If you are looking for new or lost concert footage this is not the video for you, as there is very little video footage from the actual concert that is not contained on any of the original Woodstock Movie releases. However, the documentary did contain numerous 1994 interviews that were somewhat interesting and it was also interesting to see what several of the 1969 attendees and band members looked like in 1994. I have always wondered Where are they now?, and this video answers that question for several of the 1969 concert goers. The video also contains footage of what the original concert site looked like in 1994, as well as some information on what was then, the upcoming 25th anniversary concert, Woodstock 94.
Also, if you are thinking of purchasing this DVD, it should be noted that the copy sent to me was marked as a Region 0, so it should be viewable in all regions.
However, potential purchasers of this DVD should know that this DVD is a copy of a documentary from the ABC Networks television program ""Turning Point"", which was also titled Woodstock, Behind the Myth and the Magic. The TV program was originally aired just prior to the 25th anniversary Woodstock concert in 1994.
While the producer of this DVD did a nice job on the cover sleeve and the printing on the DVD, I am only giving this DVD 3 stars because I feel like $18.99 was too expensive for a copy of a TV show that was rather poorly edited. The DVD only has a rudimentary menu, with only a Play feature, and there are no provisions for chapters. This means that if you have to stop watching this DVD and you return later, you have to fast-forward to the point that you previously quit watch. Also, in the middle of the video, there is a TV commercial break that was not completely edited out.
Hopefully, this review will give future purchasers a little better idea of what they are buying.",1485820800,,2047,4.610958904109589
