8508289,4,6305621470,"Chow and Yeh, future costars of John Woo's ""The Killer"", and Raymond Wong, one of Hong Kong's top movie clowns at the time, help achieve a nice mix of romantic comedy, farce, and horror.  The romantic comedy is  no Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, the screwball farce is no Marx  Brothers, the horror subplot is no Exorcist.  But the film manages to  please, if not impress, the viewer, since it tries hard to be amiable,  without any sex or violence that characterize many HK films.  Even the  horror sequences are fairly tame (but not at all ineffective).  It's  worth  collecting for fans of Chow or HK films in general since good-quality  videos for foreign films (speaking to US customers), especially HK films,  are sometimes hard to get.

** ADDED 6/5/2012: **

The review above is for the 1999 DVD edition made by Universe in Hong Kong.  In 2008, a remastered DVD was released in Hong Kong by Joy Sales/Fortune Star.  Both discs are now out of print, but are still being sold at Amazon.  The newer Joy Sales edition (ASIN: B004GBQW3S) offers an anamorphic widescreen video transfer that looks 100% better than the non-anamorphic picture of the Universe DVD (ASIN: 6305621470), but that is not saying much, as it still looks like it could use some more remastering.  Sharpness, contrast, and color are still very much less than optimal due to undoubtedly the age of the video source.  Unless an expensive HD scanning of the original film negative is conducted (don't count on it), it is never going to look pristine as it should.  Both discs exhibit ""ghosting"" when viewed on a progressive display, such as an HDTV or a PC monitor.  The Universe disc actually sounds better, while the audio tracks on the Joy Sales disc shows distortion, thus affecting clarity.  Both are region-free NTSC single-layer discs containing Cantonese and Mandarin audio tracks, and Chinese and mediocre English subtitles.  The Universe disc also offers Korean, Japanese, and French subtitles.  The Joy Sales disc contains lobby photos and a trailer as extras, while the Universe disc has stars' biographical notes (in English and Chinese) and trailers.",963964800,2,2138,4.938202247191011

At any rate,  enough of that.  This film was made in the 80s and looks dated but don't  let this deter you.  It's still good.  It's a fun little film about a woman  photographer from Canada(Sally Yeh) who is doing a little research on  superstitions.  She rents the wrong apartment and runs into some ghostly  problems.  Along the way she meets Chow Yun Fat and Raymond Wong who are  both interested in her.
Now, this film isn't a horror film, it's actually  a comedy and a fairly screwball one.  Sally Yeh and Chow Yun Fat are good  as usually.  But the true star of this film is Raymond Wong.  His  performance as the desperate/loser/coward character is quite a hoot.  The  film isn't as good as Mr. Vampire but it's above average fare.",953337600,4,948,4.426900584795321
8508291,4,6305621470,"This film really shocked me. I recieved it in a bundle of Chow Yun Fat DVd's I purchased. I only knew two of the titles. This one worried me, I  was scared I may have paid for a really crappy CYF film.
I was however  pleasantly suprised. I'm not usually a fan of HK comedy (too much  slapstick). But this film held up, really funny comedy (raymond wong is  particularly funny, his scenes trying to woo Sally Yeh as chow yun fat  tries as well are very funny), and good horror. Many scenes were pretty  scary (especially those dealing with a dead security guard).
A few  problems, overly cheesy (one animation scene particularly was a howl), and  an horribly cheesy conclusion. Otherwise, good HK fare",949190400,2,700,4.544
