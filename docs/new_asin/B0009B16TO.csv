2274733,5,B0009B16TO,"As a kid in the 1960's, this was one of my first favorite shows.  I just marveled at the use of magic on the show and as a kid it was so incredibly cool.  It also helped that Elizabeth Montgomery was such a stunning beauty.  The show spent six seasons in the top 25 including three in the top 10, making it one of the top shows of the 1960's.  These early, first season black and white episodes are among those that seemed to pop-up on reruns the least up until TVLand started showing them in order and allowed me to see the pilot episode for the very first time.

It was a classic cast. Dick York with his bulging eyes and seething anger was fantastic.  I disliked him as a kid because I always thought he was so mean but as I've matured I've really come to appreciate his talents and he was SO much better than Dick Sargent.  For me the best years of the show were those that were pre-Tabitha and especially pre-Adam, as the show in its final years seemed to revolve way too much around the kids.

David White as Larry Tate was one of the great supporting characters of the 1960's.  You always wondered what he did since all the work was always put on Darrin's back.  Irene Vernon co-starred as larry's wife Louise for the first two season and was replaced by the more remembered Kasey Rogers in the final six season.

And who can forget Agnes Moorehead as Samantha's ever-butting in, Darrin-hating mother Endora.  her battles with Darrin were classics.  Endora's husband, the Warlock Maurice was portrayed by Maurice Evans.  Then there were the next door Neighbors, the kravitz's played by Alice pearce and George Tobias.  Mrs. Kravitz was always witness to the craziness and witchcraft that went on in the Stephens' home that would end just before husband Abner saw it for himself, causing Abner to always think his wife was sick or going crazy.

Here are my favorite Episodes from the first season:

""Be it ever so Mortgaged"" - The Stephens' move into their new home and it's the first appearance of nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz and doubting husband Abner.

""It Shouldn't Happen to a Dog"" In what would be a recurring theme, Sam is hosting a dinner for one of Darrin's clients.  The man makes a pass at Samantha and she turns him into a dog.  We also meet Larry and Louise Tate.

""The Witches are Out""  DArrin is working on a candy ad that uses an old, ugly, haggy witch and Darrin insists on making the witch gorgeous like Sam against his client's wishes...until Sam and Aunt Clara, making her first appearance, change his mind.

'Just one Happy Family"" features Maurice's first appearance as Sams' warlock father who is not happy to hear his daughter married a mortal.

""Samantha meets the Folks"" Sam meets Darrin's parents for the first time featuring Mabel Albertson and Roy Roberts.

""A Vision of Suger Plumbs""  A true holiday classic.  The Stephens' take in an orphan boy who doesn't believe in Santa Claus until Sam take him to the North Pole to meet him in person.

""A nice Little Dinner Party""  Same arranges a dinner party for her mother to meet DArrin's parents.  Endora promises not to use magic.  Phyllis becomes jealous when Frank hits it off with Endora.

""Driving is the only Way to Fly""  Sam has to take driving lessons and her teacher is none other than the future Uncle Arthur Paul Lynde who plays a guy named Harold Harold.

""Illegal Separation""  Abner Kravitz gets kicked out of the house by Gladys and the Stephens' let him stay with them.  Sam then has to get them back together.

""Open the Door Witchcraft""  Sam uses magic to open the garage door which is seen by Gladys Kravitz.  Now Darrin has to buy a remote opener to keep up appearances but the thing keeps opening whenever a plane flies over the house.

This is one show that I have been waiting to appear on DVD for a long time!",1114732800,7,3814,4.502915451895044
2274734,5,B0009B16TO,"Screen Gem Elizabeth Montgomery never missed an episode of Bewitched in the series' run. Attractive, classy and just plain fun to watch, Liz made us all believe she was Samantha Stevens,contemporary housewife,living on Morning Glory Circle in Conneticut, with very funny relatives and funny situations.

The real magic here, was that miss Montgomery had us all believing her!

2274737,5,B0009B16TO,"Bewitched has to be one of my all time favorite shows! The characters in the series all made me laugh! Elizabeth Montgomery, Agnes Moorehead, David White, Paul Lynde,and the rest of the cast entertained millions of fans for decades and will continue to do so with the release of this series! I'm more partial to the series with Dick York as Darrin because he simply played the role better! I just wasn't interested in the show anymore once Dick Sargent took over as Darrin. What is interesting is that the first season is being offered in the original black and white as well as color giving the buyer a choice. I'm leaning towards black and white because this is how I remember watching the first couple of seasons.",1114128000,4,716,4.6015625

2274739,5,B0009B16TO,"At a time when interracial marriage was still making many Americans anxious, this sitcom helped to diffuse that real-life tension through a suburban fantasy. This show thus focuses less on the supernatural and more on issues of family, community, and idenity.

Thirty six episodes make up this 1964-1965 season. A 1963-filmed pilot episode is included in this season for good measure.

Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) is a witch who fell in love with and then married the mortal Darrin Stephens (who, for the first couple of seasons, is played by Dick York). Darrin accepts her `heritage' only on the condition that she now refrain from using witchcraft and `settle down' to be a normal American middle-class housewife.

To the horror of her mother Endora (Agnes Moorehead), Samantha has agreed to the request. But, Endora ultimately worried over nothing. Samantha herself soon discovers that giving up witchcraft was an impossible promise. Conflict between her promise and an often-more complicated reality drive this series' storylines.

Tensions immediately flare in the first season when an old flame of Darrin's (Nancy Kovak) invites them to a dinner party. Because Shelia Sommers is so obnoxious, Samantha breaks her promise in order to avoid being shown up in front of her husband. Beginning with this episode, Darrin recognizes that he cannot control when Samantha does/does not use her magic, and can only make suggestions. Whether this advice is taken then rests entirely with Samantha.

In ""Be it ever so mortgaged"" we meet Gladys and Abner Kravitz (Alice Pearce and George Tobias) who are the Steven's next door neighbors. Ever the busybody, Mrs. Kravitz begins a series-long tirade about `something weird going on over there'. Less concerned, her husband is a largely-silent type.

""It shouldn't happen to a dog"" introduces us to Darrin's boss Larry Tate (David White) and his wife Louise (at this point being played by Irene Vernon). It also previews the many problems Darrin will have working at the McMahon & Tate advertising company.

""The witches are out"" finds Samantha protesting the negative pop culture images of witches traditionally associated with American Halloweens. With the help of her beloved Aunt Clara (Marion Lorne) Samantha convinces an advertising client of Darrin's that using a pretty witch for their candy sales would be a better strategy through changing that executive's appearance: If he did not like being an ugly witch, neither did they! Aunt Clara has the distinction of being Samantha's only female relative who genuinely appears to like Darrin

Samantha meets her in-laws, Phyllis (Mabel Albertson) and Frank Stephens (Robert F. Simon) during ""Samantha meets the folks"". Aunt Clara's unexpected return and helping out upsets Darrin who had wanted his parents to believe that Samantha did all the housework by herself. Because she had wanted to find some fault with this housework (regardless of who actually did it), Phyllis was honestly disappointed by how perfect everything looked. Darrin's mother is later relieved to learn that her daughter in law is not actually a good housekeeper, and Darrin then makes up with Aunt Clara.

Aunt Clara makes another great appearance in ""There's no witch like an old witch"". Aunt Clara is a great babysitter until she accidentally tells the kids that she is a witch. Because witches supposedly do not exist, she is barred from babysitting. Although a judge (who had every reason to doubt her statement of being a witch) is instead impressed with Aunt Clara, the Stephens decide to send her to Miami for a convenient get away vacation with her friends. This will provide time for people to forget what they were told in this episode.

Forty years later, these episodes hold up great. Some sitcoms which cannot age well obviously depend on extras in the DVD sets in order to gain market appeal with `today's audience'. Bewitched is one of the rare titles which has always remained watch-able and really does not need the special features included in this release.

Even the 'black and white' filming of this season is not annoying. Bewitched was head and shoulders above many other sitcoms of the era to begin with.

The price for this product is really affordable considering the production quality AND all of the DVD extras. Exclusive DVD featurettes include bloopers, a feature how the 'magic' was performed, and a theatrical trailer for the upcoming Bewitched movie with Nicole Kidman.

I am only saddened that Montgomery and both `Darrins' are no longer around to participate in the DVD release for this series.",1113523200,216,4600,5.133689839572193
2274740,5,B0009B16TO,"Hola Amigos;

I'm for sure getting my ""Bewitched"" DVD Seasons 1 & 2 and then all the way to 8th Season here in Lima-Peru (South America)!

I have enjoyed and cherished this show ever since I was a kid in the 80's and right now it's on Cable TV for all of Latin America in two stations:

""Retro TV"" and ""TCM Turner Classic Movies""

So if you ever come to visit Peru and Latin America you can have some fun with ""Hechizada"" in spanish (and portuguese in Brasil!).

Actually I was going to buy it even without the extra audio track and hoping it could have good sells in USA that eventually they'd release a DVD edition for Latin America with the spanish extra audio track!

So it's a very nice surprise that it features the extra audio tracks in spanish and even in portuguese!

When I receive my ""Bewitched"" DVD this up coming june from Amazon.com I'll take some digital pictures of me receiving my parcel and then opening the package and watching the show playing on my DVD player!

It's going to be quite an event for me!

I just hope it arrives on saturday afternoon when I'm not at work. Well, it all dependes on calculating the day I place my order...

Very well done Sony Pictures and Sreen Gems!

I knew this important release couldn't let me down and that it was going to be a real collector's gem!

I really hope some of my posts here and there with my resquest helped --at least a little bit-- just as my international phone call to the DVD producer on charge of the ""Bewitched"" DVD special features some weeks ago......I want to believe so.

I'm so getting my DVD from Amazon!

I have bought from them different DVDs and they have proven me excellence!

I just watched last week that episode with Serena zapping Mrs. Stephens into a cat!. I didn't remember this episode so well since I last watched ""Bewitched"" over ten years ago! Very funny!

Serena is quite a dish while dancing in the Stephens living room!

I wish for ""Bewitched"" DVD to have a very nice picture on the cover, not that dull cover of a --bad drawing-- cartoon Samantha on her broom, a previous VHS I've seen here that looks more like a bad pirate copy.

I want the Menu of the DVD with an interactive cartoon Sam pointing at every selection with a nice background audio!

Something very nice also would be that every time you enter a selection in the Menu a ""Zap!"" or ""Twitch!"" sound would pop in and out!

By the way: The spanish version has no laugh track so all the Zaps! and Poofs! on the show are untouched with no laughing stepping on!

The extras could include rare footage, promotional pictures, original promos, even those ads like Kodak, Clairol, Chevrolet...and Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery)!

I know that with a little effort they can release a very nice Bewitched DVD and for the future seasons too!

Samantha deserves it and we: Die hard life time fans!

I work for the Tourist Information Offfice down here in Lima-Peru, let me know if you plan to come and visit Machu Picchu (The lost citadel of the Incas) I'll feel very happy to help you with your visiting and to share nice ""Bewitched"" memories!

I can't hardly wait for my ""Bewitched"" DVD!

Looking forward to hear from you all very soon!

Bewitching Regards!

2274812,5,B0009B16TO,"Although I previously purchased the colorized version (which I will admit isn't bad at all quite actually, considering that not too many years earlier, colorized versions of various shows were a bit disappointing), I opted to purchase this black and white version anyways.  First, it's still available so why not get while it still is and pricing is reasonable.  Secondly, I simply wanted re-live the memory of having viewed the first season as a young kid, in black and white, on the old television sets most of us remember having.  While the colorized version is perfectly fine, I'm just of the opinion that glorious black and white allows your imagination to wander just a wee bit more in some ways, offering a special touch that sometimes colorization seems to take away from, if that makes sense..  I suppose it wouldn't be too terribly difficult to simply plop in the colorized dvd version, make some adjustments to my current television to enjoy essentially the same black and white experience -- but why go through all that fuss just to have to undo your adjustments afterwards? ..  Bewitched will always remain 'magical' for a whole host of reasons, but it's great to stroll down memory lane again enjoying that first season as most of us truly remember it, in black and white.",1466208000,,1286,4.827272727272727

2274932,5,B0009B16TO,"Okay, I'll admit when I'm wrong and boy was I wrong about this. When the colorized versions of Bewitched came out I was horrified and said I'd never watch or buy them, I only wanted the black and white versions, as the show was originally shown. HOWEVER as a student of mid-century modern design, my curiosity got the best of me and I just had to know what colors were used for the sets during the first two years of the show. I still like the black and white versions best but I've enjoyed the color versions immensely. The colorization isn't perfect but for those of us who have been dying to know what color everything was, this is a priceless resource.

The only thing that really, really aggravates me (and this applies to the black and white versions as well) is the fact that Sony cut off the original Screen Gems credits at the end for seasons 1-5. To me this is as integral as opening or closing credits and should not be messed with under any circumstances. If the current owner wants to ADD credits up front or at the end, I can see that, but never should anything that was part of the original broadcast be removed. Sony seems to have gotten some feedback on this as later release seasons do have the Screen Gems credits at the end intact. I wish the earlier seasons would be released in their entirety with the Screen Gems credits appropriate to each year restored.",1416614400,6,1378,4.425196850393701

2274950,5,B0009B16TO,"Bewitched was a groundbreaking, clever, unique, situation comedy that gently addressed our radically changing social and cultural values during the turbulent 1960s. The show first aired in the Fall of 1964 and reflects a world still untouched by the changes that are beginning to rock our Western world. By series end in 1972, the show reflects a social order closer to what we know today.  Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) is a beautiful witch who falls in love with Darrin (played by Dick York, and later in the series, Dick Sergeant). Darrin tells Samantha he just wants a ""normal"" marriage. He's the breadwinner. He provides whatever is needed. She is the 'good wife' who stays at home and in her place. He asks her to suppress her true nature and not express her witches powers because that's what 'normal' looks like in Darrin's ""mortal' culture. Samantha's mother, Endora (Agnes Moorehead) is infuriated that anyone would attempt to control her daughter and force her to suppress her true nature and gifted abilities evem though Samantha says it's her choice to do so. From there, the calamity of differnt world views collide. Throughout the series, Darrin, along with hysterical neighbor Gladys Kravitz and many others meet the ever more diverse members of Samantha's family and learn sometimes happily and sometimes reluctantly that we live in a colorful world of diversity and non-conformity.",1406678400,3,1401,5.144736842105263

2274995,5,B0009B16TO,"I really think the Bewitched DVDs I have,have kept me more or less sane since I've had them. Maybe it's weird that an old TV show with eccentric or semi-eccentric characters based around the situation of a ""normal mortal human being"" married to Samantha,a witch who has powers more like a magician  or a fairy godmother than a stereotypical witch...when she acts more like mortal people/non-witches behave is when she gets the worst character-traits she shows... But my old favorite show from when I was a kid, at least is a sort of escape or a sort of stability from where or what my thoughts usually run to. Often I am thinking of what they do to animals,in slaughter and for food and in labs and research and testing,and it is very horrible. Very upsetting and depressing.

 I watched(well,I had it on,online,on my laptop. I listened to it and peeked through my fingers maybe 3 times for a good 2 or 3 seconds each time)....to say ""I watched"" Glass Walls narrated by Paul McCartney wouldn't exactly be accurate. But I did listen to it. Crying or in plain anguish the whole time. There probably are people who can watch and/or listen to Glass Walls and they might not get upset, or be affected by it at all.

I can't. I started crying and didn't stop. And my life circumstances are fairly tolerable. The animals have to live and die in what they're born into,and can never escape from. Just knowing about it is horrible and upsetting and very wounding to the psyche... But the animals live and are slaughtered in horrible and completely abnormal and cruel states of existence. Suffering. Misery. Nothing natural or normal is in their whole lives. I couldn't watch it but I did listen to it. I tried watching it about a year ago. I couldn't. I lasted about a minute or less and had to turn it off.

Maybe a weird review for a Bewitched DVD but,like I said,since my time and thinking is usually taken up by things that are not so nice,or are very horrible and upsetting to think about (I'm always trying to be a better animal rights advocate and I also have PTSD;it's not a fun thing but these two things go together very naturally. They sort of fuel each other. ) It's good or a relief to put on a DVD and just take my mind off serious or upsetting things for awhile. I watch Bewitched when I exercise,which also helps me keep the routine or habit fairly regularly most of the time. Having some relief from stress and my typical state of mind is probably an addiction or habit not unlike drinking or any other escapism or escapist form of behavior that people have. We don't like to suffer or be in misery. People will drink to escape feeling that way. I doubt it helps,even though it might feel good for a little while... But an exercise habit actually does make you feel better because of the endorphins,the ""feelgood"" brain chemicals your brain and body produce naturally when you do physical activity. And the show has enough moments that make you smile,if not laugh a little bit. Or laugh out loud. I might just be an easy audience, but I think The Joker Is A Card episode is hysterical. I actually like the first 2 seasons the best and I tend to ""do Groundhog Day"", like the Bill Murray movie,watching (every time I exercise) the first few episodes on the first DVD.... I've watched all 8 seasons at least once or twice (I've had them for about 10 months,just so I don't sound too weird...)and I tend to like the first disc the most. Though all 8 seasons have some good or very good or a ""best"" episode in them too.

Double Split,Double Tate,Disappearing Samantha,The Joker Is A Card,My Grandson,The Warlock,Abner Kadabra,Always Speak The Truth,Illegal Separation,and most or all of the first season are some of,for my tastes,the best episodes. They're very tame and very mid and later '60's TV (which is nothing at all like television is today,I'm sure- I have no idea what's on television because I quit watching TV a very long time ago. I have had bouts of TV watching. I had cable for a few years etc but that was when Southpark was a newer show....I liked the outrageous humor in it. I also liked Seinfeld, Roseanne,Home Improvement and the BBC show,Absolutely Fabulous. Also the Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker Dr. Who seasons or series when they each played  Dr. Who in Dr. Who. My tastes are pretty tame and G-rated...except I also Robin Williams,George Carlin and Richard Pryor. Still pretty tame,but not exactly G-rated. And I like Bill Cosby. His stand-up comedy is both tame and G-rated. I always loved the ""Sisters"" song Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye did,when they dressed in evening gowns and took over the showgirl number in White Christmas. For years when I was growing up,that was on every Christmas Eve and we always watched it ).

For plain entertainment that is easy to watch and is just nice to watch, Bewitched is a good show. I'm putting this review on the first season set of DVDs,which also comes in the original black and white format(I might get it sometime. I actually kind of like black and white TV, films,and photographs). Anyone who liked the show would enjoy these DVDs. Anyone too young to have seen it (though I'm sure it's floating around on cable TV or dish channels) would also like it. It's something you can sit and watch with your five year old child and not worry about what they're seeing or hearing. For me it's something that allows me to take my mind off things that are very stressful and almost always on my mind...I can't help thinking of what they do to animals because you can't get through a day,or even an hour,without being reminded of what animals are going through,are being put through,by man.

But anyone in any intense or stressful situation goes through the same thing I'm talking about. War veterans with PTSD,caregivers with special needs children or a sick or disabled family member,or people who have just had a lot dealt to them that is hard to bear. It's hard, if not impossible, to take it all on every day,without a break from it or some kind of relief. Mother Theresa said ""God only gives us what He knows we will faithfully do...I only wish He didn't trust me so much!"" Or words to that effect. It's close but I don't think I quoted her completely accurately.",1384560000,,6227,4.577578475336323

2275013,5,B0009B16TO,"Well, I have just finished the 1st season of Bewitched & I'm just as enchanted with this show now as an adult the same as I was when I was a youngster viewing the daily reruns of this magical sitcom.

And let me just add that I bought the ""black and white"" edition of this DVD collection. I'm pretty old school in my thinking that old movies and sitcoms don't need to be ""improved"" with digital colorization. Maybe it's just me.

At any rate, the 1st season of Bewitched introduces us to the mixed marriage of witch Samantha (the beautiful Elizabeth Montgomery) to her mortal husband Darrin Stephens (the affable Dick York) and Samantha's host of otherworldly relatives, most notably Agnes Moorehead as Samantha's meddling mother Endora.

In this early stage of the show, the Darrin/Endora conflicts hadn't quite developed to the levels one might have grown accustomed to from watching the show in later seasons when it seemed that the two were going at it in every episode & Endora was zapping ""Darwin"" with some kind of spell, but I guess that's part of the fun in watching the show in its chronological order, seeing how the relationships between the characters would build over time.

Included in the first season are the next door neighbors, Abner Kravitz and his busy body wife Gladys, and more of Samantha's magical relatives including her father Maurice & the bumbling, but well meaning Aunt Clara plus some mighty fine looking neighbors, most notably the characters of ""Pleasure O' Reilly"" and her baby sister ""Danger O' Reilly"" (insert wolf whistle).

Back then I loved the magical part of the show but now I like it more for the humor and all the cool cars and gadgets they had back than that we don't have today. It also makes me wish America was still like this,it had to be a great time to be alive.
I wish the family unit was still this way as well. A Mom and a Dad living in the same house, married and loving each other. Darrin went to work and Samantha stayed home to take care of their house and children. He made enough to support them and they had no big worries about a job or money. It just seems like a better time than this crappy 21st century where the economy sucks, no jobs, and the family unit is in disarray.

2275063,4,B0009B16TO,"The mid 60's was a golden time in television.  The time period marked the transition from black and white to color programming, accompanied by an explosion of creativity that produced a number of ground breaking sitcoms that would become classics.  Among them was Bewitched (1964-71), a series that featured a witch with a mortal husband.

Bewitched put a magical spin on traditional middle class suburban life.  Besides the normal adjustments, newlywed Darrin Stephens (Dick York) also faced some unique challenges because his wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) possessed magical powers, and her family and friends were mostly witches and warlocks.  And some, like Sam's mother Endora (Agnes Morehead), were not exactly thrilled by the ""mixed marriage"".

Compared to what would follow later, the witchcraft and special effects featured in the first season, reflects a measured, ""less is more"" approach, as the emphasis is generally more on the establishing of relationships, and character development.  Sam usually performs magic by twitching her nose, but she also uses hand gestures, or recites incantations.  The presentation of the magic develops a certain sense of style, with an emphasis on practical effects, although camera tricks are also used.

While the supernatural aspects are definitely a factor, it is the creative writing involving real life situations, and some very solid acting performances, that are the main reasons for the program's success.  After being on television for years, Elizabeth Montgomery (1933-95) found the perfect role as Samantha, working with her then husband William Asher, the executive producer of Bewitched.  Sam is smart, sexy, sophisticated, and yet compassionate and totally down to earth.  The complete and total package, she understands nearly everything in the modern ""mortal"" universe, as well as her own supernatural one.  In 1964, could there have been a more ideal wife for the average American business executive?

As Darrin, Dick York nicely fits the mold of an average American businessman.  He's reasonably attractive, but no pretty boy, with more than his share of faults.  Prone to emotional outbursts, Darrin struggles early on with his unique situation, and is often clueless, but over time, he learns to recognize when witchcraft may be involved, and discovers better ways to cope.

The supporting cast is excellent, headed by screen veteran Agnes Morehead (Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte), as Sam's crusty mother Endora, who although she finds her daughter's marriage to a mortal distasteful, is attempting to come to terms with it.  David White is great as Darrin's boss Larry Tate.  Alice Pearce would win an Emmy posthumously, in recognition for her performance as nosey neighbor Gladys Kravitz.  And George Tobias is also great, as the deadpan Abner Kravitz.

Highlights in Season One include, ""A Nice Little Dinner Party"" where Darrin's parents meet Endora for the first time, creating some turmoil in their marriage.  In ""Ling Ling"", Sam transforms a Siamese cat into a beautiful woman, who then becomes a model in one of Darrin's ad campaigns.  Samantha convinces Gladys Kravitz that she has ESP in ""Abner Kadabra"", causing her high strung neighbor to attempt to develop her psychic ""powers"".

Confusion abounds in ""...And Something Makes Three"", as Larry believes that Sam is pregnant, but it is his wife Louise (Irene Vernon) who is actually expecting.  Curiously no further mention of the pregnancy is mentioned for the remainder of Season One.  In ""The Girl Reporter"", Darrin is interviewed by a flirty woman who is interested in more than business tips.

The Kravitz have a spat, and Abner becomes a houseguest at the Stephens' in ""Illegal Separation"".  In ""That Was My Wife"", Larry believes that Darrin is having an affair, but the woman in question is actually Sam wearing a wig.  When Darrin gets involved with a sexy neighbor, Endora asks ""George, the Warlock"", to drop by for a visit.  Christopher George guests as Sam's unsuccessful former suitor.

Compared to what the series would become later, the stories in the first season are a bit more grounded in reality, with only sporadic instances of magic, and occasional visits by Sam's relatives.  The writing improves as the season progresses, setting the stage for Season Two, where the level of magic would dramatically increase.

Season one is available in the original black and white, and a colorized version.  Purists may regard colorization as sacrilegious, however the process has greatly improved since its early days, and the colorized Bewitched episodes actually look pretty accurate.  Image quality for the series is quite good, with 36 episodes on four single sided DVD's.  Subtitles are available, but only in Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Thai.",1355270400,,4792,5.292328042328043

I would trust buying from you next time if there are any products you're going to sell... I would like to thank you for selling me this series I will totally take great care of it and enjoy them.  I'm really big on buying different series of shows I love or hadn't seen them except for 1 show and decide to start from season 1 and collect the rest of the series.

Once, I'm ready to buy my next season of this series, I'll be sure to look for your username to see if you might have any more...

Also, I'm a frequent customer here on Amazon, and I would give Amazon 4-5stars for their services because I'm always satisfied or  way satisfied with everything I order Good Job and I continue to keep my service with your website...

Anyway the funny thing is the show I bought was season 1 of ""Bewitched"" and my mother's name is Samantha and mine is Tabitha... She says she didn't copy off the show but it was around the time the show was on air when she was a little girl.

But I like those types of shows (supernatural) so much I've collected quite a bit of the entire series.  Such as Charmed, Ghost Whisper, almost all of Medium as well as her books, all the Twilight movies and 4 books (except for the last one which is cut into two diff movies), and I'm starting on the vampire diaries DVD series.  I'm even into Harry Potter at my age LOL...

So I think the collection of Bewitched would be a great addition to my collection.  I just had to add that tad bit in there because most people find it amusing ' b/c the 1st time people learn our names it's the 1st thing said oh like the show ""Bewitch.""

Anyway, yes I love my 1st season, it was used and I was surprised it would be in such good shape...  Also I was impressed that since this show was aired in black and white the DVDs were copied in color which was pretty awesome...",1341619200,,2023,4.156410256410257

Bewitched is a fun show. You would think that being able to cast spells, become invisible, and fly would make your life easier; but somehow Samantha or one of her relatives managed to cause problems. I thought that Darrin as a loving husband should have been more tolerant about her witchcraft, but the show would not have been as funny if he didn't seem unreasonable at times. And they did always make up at the end.
In later episodes, however, they reworked earlier plots and they were not as well done as the originals.",1321056000,,669,4.491803278688525

2275089,5,B0009B16TO,"I was very fortunate to have gotten this wonderful season 1 as well as season 2 at Target for the amazing price of $20.00 for both seasons. I'm sure this is one of those amazing deals. Still I don't understand why Amazon has each season for $30.99 per season, for a show that is still in syndication (on TV). I received two seasons for $20.00. I know that's a great deal, but perhaps Amazon will bring the price down to $20.00 for each season.

It is a great show and brought back fond memories. I thought the writers made Darrin too much of a jerk in the first episodes...if I were Samantha I would have left him, when he called her a liar, and said she couldn't possibly have come up with a great idea without her magic, and in another episode when Darrin's client was making passes at Sam, and Darrin didn't believe her, until he saw it with his own eyes. I still enjoyed all the episodes, and I love Endora (Agnes Moorehead)...she was perfect for Sam's mom right from the start. Absent-minded Aunt Clara is wonderful, too. But non can compare with Elizabeth Taylor playing Samantha. Note: Samantha doesn't really twitch her nose, she moves her mouth back and forth to look like she's twitching her nose. Don't let that bother you. It is still magical. These are DVDs worth getting. I only hope amazon cuts the price to $20.00 a series.",1277942400,,1339,4.46530612244898

2275092,5,B0009B16TO,"Bewitched was one of several 60s comedies, that had fantasy themes. Other shows in the same genre, included I Dream Of Jeannie, The Adams Family, The Flying Nun, Mister Ed, My Favorite Martian, etc.

Bewitched's shtick revolved around an ordinary housewife, who had extraordinary magical powers. Samantha Stevens happened to be a witch, who was married to her husband, Darrin. Darrin was a regular guy (a mortal in witche's lingo) without magical powers, just like the rest of us.

Darrin had to deal not only with the powers of his wife, but also his wife's many relatives, including his little daughter, Tabitha. Samantha and her witchy family, were always twitching their noses and conjuring-up chaos, for poor Darrin. He was forever trying to hide Samantha's, and her family's, supernatural mischief from his boss, Larry Tate.

Elizabeth Montgomery was excellent in her role as suburban wife, mother, and witch, Samantha Stevens. There were two different actors who played Darrin, throughout the series. Both of them, coincidently, had the same first name; Dick. Dick York, played Darrin early in the series. Dick Sargent, stepped into the role of Darrin, after Dick York left the show in 1969.

To me, Dick York was better than Dick Sargent, as the high-strung, overwrought Darrin Stevens. Other supporting cast members, really shone in this series. Especially David White as Darrin's demanding boss, Larry Tate. And also Agnes Moorehead, as Samantha's meddling mother, Endora.

Bewitched was a very entertaining show, that was enjoyable for all ages. And it's really stood the test of time. I highly recommend it, for fans of '60s sitcoms.",1261872000,,1645,5.169172932330827

There are some things you don't mess with.

These black and white episodes take us back to a time that was more simple and yet oh so comfortable. If you're a true Bewitched fan as I am, you will relish watching and re-watching these wonderful episodes in their original, fabulous black and white.

And how beautiful was Elizabeth Montgomery is these episodes. To me, the Grace Kelly of the small screen. So elegent. A true beauty from any angle. Durwood was a lucky man. :-)",1251676800,2,800,4.548611111111111
2275095,5,B0009B16TO,"I've just been looking through the cast list for BEWITCHED and other than the children, everyone in this beloved show died awhile ago.  I wonder how many of them realized they'd be best remembered for this show.  In some cases, they were remembered for nothing else, this show has had such lasting impact.  One would think I would have outgrown this show. I watched it as a kid and here I am watching it at age 61!  This first season is stellar. It starts out with Dick York as Darren finding out that he is married to a witch, Samanatha.

I think the universal aspect this series captured was the ultimate nightmare of life with the in laws and life with the nosy neighbors and interfering boss. If all the rest of us endured the day to day irks of in-law life, at least none of ours could turn us into a frog, or worse. If our boss was an idiot, at least he wasn't on the verge of discovering we lived with a coven. And if the neighbors gossiped about us, then at least their gossip didn't lead to constant calls to the police that they come out and inspect us because we were witches or aliens. And those are the good days for Darren! Just as often, he may be reduced to a bug on the floor scuttling around there for days. And the witch characters are great too. Uncle Arthur and Endora (the mother) and Aunt Clara were the best.

Watching these shows really relaxes me and let's me drift into a very pleasant place for awhile.

2275097,5,B0009B16TO,"""Bewitched"" continues to be recognized as one the greatest situation comedies of all-time. What made the series so special is that the cast and crew knew they were blessed when the show debut in the fall of 1964-everything from the writing, acting, and to the amazing special effects were innovative and original. You also have to realize ""Bewitched"" had special effects at a time when they didn't use computers or animation to depict something disappearing-those who worked on the series were dedicated and talented individuals who made more than a simple tv program-they made a televison show that has never been dated and has never stopped airing since its inception; this proves why ""Bewitched"" has had the longevity it has, while other tv series disappear and are never heard from again.
 The crowning jewel with ""Bewitched"" is Elizabeth Montgomery, who made Samantha one of the most beloved characters in broadcast history. She made acting look simple which accounts why Elizabeth received countless Emmy niminations for her portrayal. Others in the cast were first rate from Dick York to Agnes Moorehead, who was a movie star before being cast as Endora. Alice Pierce, as nosy neighbor Glady's, was a scream, and was always one of my favorite characters on the show.
 The shows 1st season is it's best. 36 episodes were produced that year, and are included in this boxset. The pilot episode, ""I Darren Take This Witch Samantha"" is really a mini-movie, in that we are introduced to the characters, and we see how Samantha and Darren discover each other. Other episodes are excellent too, from ""Witch or Wife"" to ""Mother Meets whats-His-name"", where Darren meets his mother-in-law for the first time.
 These shows were not shown in the series' first original syndication run in the early '70's; only the shows last 6 colored years were shown in daily viewings. It wasn't until 1989 that cable's Nick at Nite tv station started showing the black and white seasons and treated viewers to the best of ""Bewitched"". The first 2 years were the shows highest rated on ABC( the series finished at number 2 in the season ratings after ""Bonanaza' in 1964-1965), and ""Bewitched"" became ABC's first primetime hit. Perhaps it was the fact that America was going through a hard time in the '60's that made the show a hit, as viewers wanted to be swept away into the magical world of Samantha and her family and friends; but whatever the reason ""Bewitched"" was and is a true classic.
 There is also a colorized companion DVD boxset to this season, where the shows were colorized, but I'd suggest in buying the black and white set. The colorized shows look good, but they are the cut episodes shown in syndication, whereas the black and white shows were uncut. The black and white shows are also the ones that were originally produced that way. I have always had a problem with coloizing old movies and TV shows, as you are taking someone's hard work and are tampering with it. But if you are an ardent fan buy both the color shows and the black and white sets to complete your collection; I did!
 The only problem I have with this particular set is that the original opening has been replaced with the 1966 opening; this is obvious on a few points-the cat we see in this opening is black, but the cat in the 1964 opening is a shade of grey, and Samantha's kitchen in the original is a bit larger; also you can see the 1966 copyright on the bottom of the opening that they use in these boxset's shows. I am not complaining though; at least we have the shows forever to enjoy!
 The packaging is also first rate, with the dics coming in 2 slim-cases and are held firmly in place with hard plastic. I have had my set for 4 years and have had no problem with the dics becoming dislogged.",1238371200,,3772,4.681749622926094

Cheryl recently passed away and she was my favorite mouseketeer on The Mickey Mouse Club.  I never saw any of her other acting appearances, so I bought ""Bewitched"".  It was worth buying the entire first season just to get to see this episode.  I intend to watch every episode now that I own it because this is good!  Very entertaining, plus the video and audio is great quality. Cheryl was also in ""Leave it to Beaver"" and played Wally's girlfriend.  I'm going to buy this next.  RIP Cheryl.

2275099,5,B0009B16TO,"I was young when Bewitched was on and missed the first few seasons on prime time television though I saw the later episodes.  On reruns, my brother and I always looked with glee for the Black and White episodes of Bewitched.  We knew those were the best and were always excited when they came on television.  I am happy to see the episodes fully restored and looking beautiful as I remember them.  It's fun to see the stars on the show whom I remember other places too such as Paul Lynde and Artie Johnson.  I think we forget with all the episodes television shows ran in those days how many actors found steady work being a guest star on them.  It was fun to see some of them over and over again.  The stars in the show are wonderful to watch and Elizabeth Montgomery is a wonder.  It's surprising that she never won an Emmy but I think she was too polished and good at her job.  Dick York is wonderful too.  Agnes Moorehead is a classic actress who first introduced herself to me as Endora.  I had two ladies down the street who dressed like her and wore that kind of makeup.  My friends and I were convinced they were witches!  This is the best season of the series and don't miss it.  It was a breeze to watch these episodes in 4 straight days.

I was impressed with how they were able to colorize the episodes without making it look too bright and fake.

Epsiodes in the first season like ""That Was My Wife"" and ""A Change of Face,"" alone show the classy humor and charm that the cast members had with each other. I believe she had great chemistry with all of her cast members. I think that the original Black and White version of this show is fantastic and I also really like the colorized version.

My 19 year old daughter wanted this, and we were so excited when it arrived.  Granted, it can seem to be pretty unsophisticated humor sometimes, but we consider it wonderfully clean family fun.  Our youngest is 3 and I have no problem showing this in her presence.  Many of the recent years' ""family viewing"" has a lot of trash--language, inuendos, etc.  Last night we got a movie from the library that was a Disney movie--and the main character suddenly had a daughter ""he didn't ever know he had"".  Does that sound like a family movie?  Granted, that is becoming very common place in our culture, but it still isn't what we want to make our children think is an easy or fun lifestyle to live.  We also are really sick of the bathroom humor and bodily function noises that are even in today's cartoons.

I have the ""coloured"" version of series 1, as it was the only one released here in Australia, but it didn't get me in, the way the B/W version did.

It was still funny and as watchable as it had been back in the days before computers and mobile phones.  For good family entertainment there is very little to beat this marvellous series and I recommend it highly. They don't make shows like this anymore - the type of show where the humour is in Darren's long suffering looks, Samantha's mischievous grins and Endora's raised eyebrow.  It is a golden representative of a bygone era of simply great tv - its shame we didn't appreciate properly when we had it.",1200787200,5,704,4.669354838709677

Do yourself a favor, spend some time reading the customer reviews and only purchase from the studios that own the rights to the original prints of the shows.

I love watching the beginning and seeing the characters develop.  You get a real feel for how much this cast really respected and worked well with eachother.

2275151,5,B0009B16TO,"My connection and affection for ""BEWITCHED"", that super special '60's Sitcom , is so strong I often thought William Asher and Elizabeth Montgomery conjured up the series especially for  me.  I am delighted the series is available, complete and unedited, on DVD. The first four Seasons are currently available, and I shall review each season  in turn,  I highly recommend purchasing the First and Second Season  episodes in the original black and white; as they were originally broadcast. It's all high-quality. With the exception of the excellent series pilot episode, the picture quality of each episode  is pristine. The show was blessed and a blessing from the very beginning. ""BEWITCHED"" remains one of the most perfectly written, directed, and cast shows in TV history. The writing was clever, imaginative, and often innovative. Within its fantasy framework, ""BEWITCHED"" included important messages about the stupidity of prejudice and stereotypes, and the importance of inclusion and unconditional love. The show succeeded brilliantly because the premise never became more precious than the characters and their relationships. The series, naturally, speaks about the ""empowerment of women"" (and by extention, the empowerment of all people who might feel like an outsider because they are

in some way ""different from the norm"" or blessed with special abilities). Samantha is amazing. She is something of an outsider, but she perfectly and naturally assimilates into a mortal, suburban society that will never fully understand, accept, or appreciate her special abilities. Samantha can easily sacrifice her  witchcraft  because it is not  a sacrifice of herself or her special ""essence"". She maintains her feminity, her individuality, and her intelligence,  This is because Samantha's self-definition is never wrapped up in the fact that she is ""a witch""-- a very important fact that her mortal husband and disapproving family never completely understood. A central theme in many classic fantasy stories is the adage: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Samantha is a level-headed lady who knows that witchcraft is merely a gift; and she knows how to use her gift wisely and well. On the rare occasion when a mere mortal like Darrin was temporarily gifted with supernatural powers, the results were disasterous because the power went to his head.

  The pilot episode, credited to Sol Saks, is perfectly written and perfectly sets up the series to follow. The series begins with the magic four words: ""Once Upon A Time."" Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) is properly introduced

as a ""typical American girl who happens to be... a witch."" Fearing a prejudical reaction from her mortal mate Darrin, Samantha doesn't tell him of her special heritage unil their honymoon night. She was right. Darrin freaks out, but Dick York  is excellent as the bothered, bewildered, and harried husband on the verge of a nervous breakdown,  Samantha promises not to do anymore magic ""stuff""; or at least to ""taper off."" But the audience will cheer when Samantha gives Darrin's snobby ex-girlfriend Shelia (Nancy Kovack) exactly what she deserves at a dinner party.  Samantha and Darrin were TV'S first ""mixed marriage""; and also the first TV couple to sleep in the same bed! Samantha's parents, Endora and Maurice (the outstanding Agnes Moorehead and Maurice Evans) are happily separated and furious over their daughter's apparent marital bliss

  * SEASON  ONE HIGHLIGHTS:  Endora is quite cordial towards Darrin at their first meeting. ""Why do you object to my daughter being who and what she is?"" (The audience may well be asking the same thing). Darrin explains he wants to live a ""normal"" existence. Endora archly replies, ""What is normal to YOU young man, is to US... Assinine!"" The classic Endora vs. Darrin battle is officially ON! Endora's reaction is nothing compared to Samantha's infuriated father Maurice, who makes Darrin vanish to who knows where or what. Samantha pleads, ""I love him... with all my heart I love him. Please don't take him away from me."" Elizabeth Montgomery's performance is so sincere and touching, you never doubt the depth of Samantha's love for Darrin. The scene is a perfect illustration of one of the show's central themes: unconditional love is the most powerful ""magic"" of all.

  *  Alice Pearce is superb as Gladys Kravitz, the neighbor across the street who knows there is something special about Samantha. Pearce's priceless and pearless comedic talent reaches its apex in the episode  ""Abner Kadabra."" Gladys sees Samantha do some magic, and Samantha hurriedly convinces her that she, Gladys, has ""got the power"" of ESP. This leads to a seance scene where Gladys' long-suffering husband Abner (George Tobias) is briefly turned to dust. Marion Lorne is instantly endearing as Samantha's dotty and adorable Aunt Clara. In ""There's No Witch Like An Old Witch,"" Clara innocently tells some neighboorhood children she's a witch, and a battle-ax mother tries to have Clara declared mentally incompetent. Samantha, of course, will not stand for this.

  * In ""Driving Is The Only Way To Fly,"" Paul Lynde makes an early appearance as Harold Harold, a neurotic instructor who tries to teach Samantha to drive a car. Lynde subsequently joined the cast in the Second Season

as Samantha's mischievious Uncle Arthur. In ""It Takes One To Know One,"" Endora sends a brunette witch to seduce Darrin (!!)  and, in another episode, Christopher George makes a memorable guest appearance as a warlock ex-boyfriend of Samantha. George initially arrives to whisk Samantha away. He turns Darrin into a penquin, and ends up falling in love with Danger O'Reilly, a very mortal and attractive neighbor of Samantha and Darrin.

  ** ""BEWITCHED"" is a comedy of its time that easily transcended the decade of its original broadcasts to achieve

timelessness. There are countless reasons why ""BEWITCHED"" is as enduring as it is endearing. The allure of Elizabeth Montgomery is a primary factor. She is the main attraction. Just as Samantha bewitched Darrin, Elizabeth Montgomery enchanted TV audiences with her natural charms and the subtle, sincere delicacy of her performance.  Although Montgomery and most of  the rest of the marvelous ""BEWITCHED"" cast have sadly passed away, the spell they continue to cast is impossible to break. Don't be surprised if ""BEWITCHED"" makes you feel uplifted with tears in your eyes.",1174176000,7,6430,5.23609756097561

  1) it truely was worth buying

  2) it is cheaper to buy the whole season than to rent it

  3) the quality is much better than what we used to see on TV

She even looked up all the info on the show, stars, etc. on the internet to learn who these people were...

The acting is more subtle, the characters more endearing, and if it can be said, the plots more ""realistic"".  With a few notable exceptions, the plots and the characters became more one-dimensional as the seasons wore on.  The episodes in this season seemed more motion picture-esque and less like a TV sitcom.  As the series progressed into its 3rd season and beyond, the soundtrack and sound effects began to sound more ""cartoony"".

The only thing odd about seeing them in color is that these were filmed in the early to mid-1960's and the color doesn't always match the mood of the episodes. Having said that, the colorizing is flawless, and it will make you wish that more classic shows could be given this treatment, especially to make them more popular with younger viewers, many of whom will not watch them if they're black and white (something I've heard over and over from kids).",1166227200,3,572,4.617647058823529

This single sided 4 disc set with great artwork and packaging contains all 36 season one episodes for your viewing pleasure. Sony Pictures has done a fantastic job with the audio & video for this DVD release.

It's obvious that great care went into the presentation of this show in color format and the episodes are evidence of just that. The colors are sharp and vibrant making the show even more fun for me to watch. While I'm not in favor of colorizing classic old shows, I've really warmed up to ""Bewitched"" in color. The video transfer is excellent and the digital 2.0 audio is clean and crisp and it sounds great. ""Bewitched"" with its memorable characters and theme song is pure fun for the whole family. The bonus features include: The magic unveiled featurette and magic & mishaps featurette and I found them interesting to watch.

2275174,5,B0009B16TO,"First, this is an excellent show. I have not seen it in years and it's better then I remember it. I thought it was a bit of a denegrating show for women, because even a girl with witch powers cant escape patriarchy. However, it's clear by the 3rd episode that Samantha is a strong independent women (when she kicks Darren out of the bedroom). I now realize that the message was aimed at men, to gain a better appreciation for their wives.

The cast is wonderful, infact I don't think I will buy the seasons without dick york. Agnes Moorehead in particular is fantastic as the mother in law.

Finally, the hardest decision for me was choosing to go black and white or color. I love the black and white, but I decided to go color and Im glad I did.

2275176,5,B0009B16TO,"Blessed with superb writing, dazzling special effects, and inspired casting down to the bit roles, BEWITCHED is a must-see on DVD.  I am only at season one, but it brings back all of the nostalgic magic from watching the series live as a teenager in the mid-1960's.  Ad executive mortal Darren Stephens (Dick York) is happily married to beautiful witch Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery).  York and Montgomery have a glorious chemistry together; they truly love one another.  David White plays Darren's boss, Larry Tate; and Agnes Moorehead is a delight as Samantha's witch mother Endora.  Larry knows nothing about Samantha's powers, and Endora endlessly asks Sam why she does not use witchly powers to clean house or make dinner for David or Darwin (Endora can never remember Darren's name).  Then there is nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz (a fun Alice Pearce) who keeps seeing things that her exasperated husband Abner (George Tobias) never sees.  Topping them all may be Marion Lorne as endearingly klutzy witch Aunt Clara, who collects door knobs and keeps crashing into walls because she can never remember her spells.  In glorious black-and-white and mostly directed by William Asher, season one of BEWITCHED is an incomparably funny and even romantic invitation to own the entire series on DVD, one season at a time.

A bit corny, but good for a laugh or two.  I am a bit of a traditionalist as well, and am glad they are available in the original black and white format.

Well, I went ahead and purchased the Color version of Bewithced and I loved it! The colors are very bright and neat.

I am pleased to say I did enjoy it just as much, perhaps more.  I had forgotten how much fun the story lines are and how well scripted and acted the whole thing is.  The whole 60's housewife thing is hilarious and the 60's sets are a real treat.  The other thing that is wonderful is that you can watch it with anyone,this is good clean entertainment.

2275192,5,B0009B16TO,"""Bewitched: Season 1"" is absolutely amazing to see in the new colorized version from Sony.  I'll admit I was skeptical at first about purchasing the colorized version, however, Target ran a great sale on all three of the ""Bewitched"" seasons 1, 2 & 3, so I got them all.  They did not have the Black & White versions available, so I got the color versions, and what a surprise to see these beloved episodes in glorious color!  It's as though they were originally filmed in color and with no harsh glares or sloppy blurs, that usually accompanies colorized movies.  One ""reviewer"" claims that the ""Bewitched Season 1 -colorized version"" has been edited for syndication and is missing omitted footage.  And that the ""Bewitched Season 1 -B&W version"" is not edited and features the full-length episodes as they were originally aired.  If anyone here has viewed both the ""Colorized"" and the ""B&W"" versions of  ""Bewitched: Season 1"" and have found this to be true, please let us all know here in a ""review.""  Here is a listing of ""Bewitched: Season 1"" episodes:

Endora, as usual, tries to break up the marriage again by using a handsome male warlock named George from his harem to woo Samantha. When his plan (and Endora's) is unsuccessful, he turns himself into a raven with a lot of talent, so much talent that he creates a perfect image for Darrin's advertising campaign for typewriters.

THAT WAS MY WIFE: Darrin and Samantha try to spice up their marriage by reserving a suite at a fancy hotel.

2275193,5,B0009B16TO,Got this for my daughter's birthday. The whole family loves it.  Great stories and fun to watch.  If only the crazy people that make TV show today had this talent and gave us this level of quality.  We also got Wild Wild West first season and it is equally as good.,1152403200,2,265,4.1568627450980395
2275194,5,B0009B16TO,"I loved watching Bewitched as a child and I still love watching the series as an adult. Samantha's willingness to give up a lifestyle she'd known for hundreds of years to be with a man that's truly YOUNGER than she, a man that she loves, is a wonderful example of sacrificial love. And Darrin's growing ability to learn to accept Samantha's ""talents"" as part of who she is is a remarkable lesson in human growth. They show the world that when you love someone, it's okay to make a few sacrifices, to accept change, and to be willing to change and grow together.",1149292800,7,561,4.456310679611651
2275195,5,B0009B16TO,"I am an avid collector of classic Television shows and I have purchased several collections, such as The Golden Girls and The Munsters and I was not impressed with any of them, other than the fact that I could watch my favorite shows whenever I wanted in their entirety, until now. Bewitched the complete first season, is housed in a nice slip case that is not susceptible to finger prints like many others. And the discs are housed in two separate plastic cases, not some cheap cardboard cases. And the colorization is magnificent. It is so crisp and clean, as if it had been aired in all its color glory. I highly recomend this collection and I am very pleased with the job sony did re-releasing this.",1149033600,11,703,4.543307086614173
2275196,5,B0009B16TO,"Watching this collection brougt back so many memories of watching this when I was younger. It is good to see that alot of the ""older"" sitcoms are coming back on DVD so that our generation can share some good clean comedy with our children, instead of watching alot of the shows now that have alot of smut and bad language in them. I am going to buy all of the seasons that come out.",1148342400,5,382,4.175675675675675
2275197,5,B0009B16TO,"I have always loved this show as it was a staple of my family's weekly viewing when I was a little girl.  After all these years, it's a pleasure to see the best of the early shows in color, and they never lose their charm.  Maybe that's why this and several other TV shows have homes on cable channels like Nick at Nite and TVLand?

My personal favorite episode is where Sam gives Darrin's snooty exgirlfriend more than a well-deserved dose of her own medicine after trying to belittle her during a party.  There's plenty of other fun to be had on the other 35 episodes of this legendary TV series' first season, and they all show Elizabeth Montgomery's character to be a witch who's funny, down-to-earth, sensible, and has kooky relatives that may remind you of some of your own!  917 minutes of nose wiggling fun.  Enjoy!",1148169600,5,823,4.527027027027027
2275198,3,B0009B16TO,"I purchased the colorized version of season one because of the multitude of Amazon reviewers who raved about how natural it looked, and what improvements had been made with the technology since Ted Turner colorized everything he could in the 80's.

Well, it's okay, fairly convincing, but too intense at times. (I turned down my color on the tv set a little bit to make it look more natural. Much better results.)  Yes, they seem to have gotten the hues correct when it comes to Endora's hair and gowns, and skin tones are good. But there are still issues, like Larry Tate's fake looking hair color, and sometimes the furniture/walls/business suits all seem to have very similiar shades of gray/blue/brown. But it is acceptable, just not excellent which I had expected.",1146614400,6,769,4.862595419847328
2275209,5,B0009B16TO,"First I would like to ask why Sony did not include the original opening credits for the first two season release of series. They are clearly using the credits used during the 3rd season when the show went color(1966-1967)and just made it look b&w.

That out of the way, I have to say that when the show was originaly premiered on ABC I wasn't born yet and by the time it went off the air I was 3. I started watching the show in syndication when i was like 11 and loved it. Of course these were edited reruns (to allow the stations more time for more commercials)so it's great to see them uncut for the first time. I have the first three seasons the first two in b&w (I'm not a fan of colorized shows or movies)The quality is great, I only wish that they had included more extras like promos, original commercial intros etc, something similar to the ""I Love Lucy"" sets. But all in all I highly recomend this series to any and all Bewitched fans I'm looking forward to the rest of the series on DVD.",1146182400,10,997,4.247368421052632
2275210,5,B0009B16TO,"i bought this set for my wife who just loves bewitched and hated when nick at night took this show off in favor of roseanne.

  this first season is just great in all it's b&w glory. the shows are in great shape and dick york and elizabeth montgomery are a great screen team and the idea of the show is still very funny and fresh i hope they come out with every season of this great show from the past.",1145232000,2,402,4.0
2275211,3,B0009B16TO,"Bewitched was one of my favourite show back when I was a child

in Australia, but they only showed the colour episodes, so it's

great to see season 1 in black and while (I don't like colourised episodes). It's a quality show and it even has subtitles which I appreciate. It's also good to see the evolution of the show, as it's just slightly different from the seasons that follow, quite a few ""human drama"" episodes in this season, like trying to get a collague a girfriend, helping a mother cope with her young son, adopting a child for christmas etc., the only disappointment about the Christmas show is that they didn't allow Darrin to remember the trip. The only major gripe I have about the package is that the opening titles are from 1966 not 1964, which annoyed me so much that I only giving this 3 stars!!!",1144454400,6,816,4.469798657718121
2275212,5,B0009B16TO,"Show: Oh my stars! Bewitched has finally made its way to DVD, and this is cause for celebration. The show is a classic, pure and simple. The wild fun and mishaps starring everyone's favorite witch, the incomparable Elizabeth Montgomery, are a treat to get reaquainted with. Also fun are Aunt Clara's (Marion Lorne) bumbling antics, Endora's (Agnes Moorehead) wild spells and her disdain for all things mortal, in particular her new son-in-law Darrin (or Darwin, Dogwood, or what's-his-name?). Also priceless are Darrin's (Dick York) reactions. Best of all, witness the enchanting Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha. Don't hesitate for a second. Buy this set! (6/5)

Video: Now here is where things get interesting. The first two seasons of ""Bewitched"" were originally filmed in black and white. However, the fine folks at Sony have decided to release the first season in both black and white and colorized sets. After a rather exhaustive search through stores to find the black and white version, I had to settle for the colorized set. To be completely honest, the colorized episodes look surprisingly good. I have seen those 1980's colorized films, and they look horrid. Here, the colors look much more natural, and its obvious that the colorists took great care in what they were doing. Anyone who didn't know that these episodes were originally made in black and white wouldn't even know they weren't originally filmed in color, they look that good. I still, however, slightly prefer black and white, so I will often just turn the color off on my televsion which seems to work quite well. The prints used are in amazing condition for a 40 year old show. I have never seen ""Bewitched"" look this good. There is some print damage, but nothing too distracting. (4/5)

Audio: The 1.0 Mono track sounds quite good. Dialogue never sounds distorted, and there is only a very slight hiss. Not bad overall. (4/5)

Extras: First up is the featurette ""The Magic Unveiled."" The program runs about 15 minuted total, but is spread out over the first two discs for some reason. This is a good featurette with some interesting bits of trivia. There is also a blooper reel featuring some continuity mistakes on the episodes. This featurette is rather pointless and was not necessary. (2/5)

Overall: This classic series has finally arrived on DVD in a decent set. Great audio and video and some fun featureas make this set easy to recommend. Now, should you buy the colorized or the black and white set? Purists should stick with the black and white if they can find it. If a black and white set cannot be found, they should go ahead and buy the colorized set, and just turn the color off. If you hate black and white, go for the colorized set, you won't regret it. Everyone else can safely buy the colorized set and just turn the color on or off, depending on which way you want to watch it. Now go, get this set, and get ready to be ""Bewitched!""

2275216,5,B0009B16TO,"As a child, I remember watching the reruns and thinking that I wanted a wife just like Samantha when I grew up. Actually, this wasn't even the more magical and beautiful Samantha of the first two seasons, because as I recall, the reruns were mostly from the later years. So I am discovering the ""original"" Bewitched for the first time with the release of Seasons 1 and 2. The differences couldn't be more striking. The early shows were better written, intensely original, more earnest, less campy and less trendy (giving them a timeless quality). Those first 2 seasons hold their own against any sitcom in television history. Not only did the quality of the show decline in the later years (often dramatically), what really caught my attention was how thin Elizabeth Montgomery would become (and the camera adds pounds). In the first couple of seasons she was ""healthy"" and nearly full-figured. The extra flesh on her face only enhanced her beauty. And, oh, was she beautiful. I find myself pausing the DVD from time to time just to admire and consume the still image of her beauty. The black and white, I think, also accentuates how beautiful she was. It gives her an ethereal, delicate, exotic and spiritual quality that compliments the theme of the show.

Maybe Samantha is no longer considered the ideal woman. Even without children she stayed home and made house. She is a woman from another time and place, and maybe that's where she belongs -- as a personality from our childhood and all the sweet memories that conjures up.

Bewitched, particularly the first 2 seasons, is otherworldy and completely enchanting, as is its star. I have a hard time watching most TV shows even once. But I can watch these Bewitched episodes over and over.",1141776000,8,1744,4.81

I chose the black and white version and I am glad I did. There is something wonderful about watching a vintage show or movie in its original black and white. This show was made before I was born, and somehow the black and white makes it really feel like a time before my own.

I have been reading the other reviews about the color version to help my decision.  From most of what I read the color version has a good quality to it and it's worth the purchase.  I might actually get both since there isn't anything like watching a great classic in the original format.  Since they will release the second season soon, I hope they continue to release the other seasons as well.

Elizabeth Montgomery and Dick York displayed wonderful chemistry throughout York's five year run on the show. There could be no other Darrin but York. Agnes Moorehead, David White and the adorable Marion Lorne rounded out a steller cast.  I would recommend this box set for every Bewitched fan. It is truly worth the investment.

I will say however, that it would have been an added bonus had Sony taken the time to insert original commercials from sponsors Quaker Oats and Chevrolet, along with interviews with Bewitched cast members.",1125446400,7,750,4.889763779527559

I am glad they gave the choice of colorized or original black and white. I didn't realize ALL these episodes were not in color. I only remember the first episode- which before now I had only seen once- being in black and white. Loved ease of watching without interuption of commercials- didn't stop me from picking up the remote during ""fade-out"" scenes- force of habit I guess. Highly recommended!",1125187200,4,723,4.2846715328467155
2275244,4,B0009B16TO,"Please note that the following review concerns the DVD release of the show, and not the show itself (which I would give five stars to).

Ever since the medium of DVD has been around, which isn't that long, I have waited impatiently for Bewitched to be given the full treatment. It was with great pride and excitement that I bought both the black and white set and the colorized. I love both infinitely! They shall never leave my collection or be borrowed out as they are worth more than gold as now I can see in crystal clarity all the first season adventures of Samantha, Durweed, Endora and all the others.

The episodes are uncut which is all that I could ask for as they are ruthlessly edited for TV today as we are treated to more commercial time than in the 60s. I love the menus, how the animated opening to the show has been re-worked for a fun introduction to the DVDs.

I do have some ""clouds"" in this silver lining though and they are as follows:

The lack of the original sponsor openings and end credits is disappointing. Anyone who has seen these can tell you that they make the viewing of Bewitched all the more interesting and fun. Even if the sponsor openings couldn't be used at least the generic first season opener that Nick-at-Nite used should've been on here. What this release has is the grayscale version of the Season Three opener. My disappointment in this regard also applies to the lack of the ""Bewitched Be Right Back"" interstitial which was found just before the ending scenes.

The lack of first season photos used for the cover art on both the box and the slip cases. It would seem only natural that if it's a first season set that they would want to use pictures from that season.

The ""Magic and Mayhem"" featurette seems like a waste of valuable space that could've been used for original cast commercials.

And some 'typos' such as numbering the episode titled ""Witch or Wife"" as episode 8 when it's really 9 and ""The Girl Reporter"" as nine when it's really 8. Also in the description of Episode 10: ""Just One Happy Family"" Samantha's father is referred to as Victor (which is what his name was in the original script) when it should be Maurice.

Overall, I cannot express how happy I am with this release. Hopefully Season Two will have the mistakes worked out.

******************************************************
About the colorization - I will say that they have done a fantastic job at making it look as real as possible, but there are quite a few times where they did not get the original colors correct even when there were photos to go by. Case in point, the episode titled ""Witch or Wife"" had a still photo from it used for the first TV Guide cover in November 1964 devoted to Bewitched. It comes from the scene where Samantha runs into the Tates in Paris. The colorized episode has Samantha wearing a pink top, a white hat, and her makeup is in natural colors. The photo shown on the cover of TV Guide (which can be found on any of the Bewitched sites) shows that Elizabeth Montgomery was actually wearing a goldish brown top and hat as well as having ruby red lipstick on and blue eyeshadow not to mention the sets being in browns and yellows, not pink like it is colorized on the set.

Of course, to the casual viewer, this discrepancy wouldn't be noticed but to HUGE Bewitched fans such as myself, this and the other colorizing mistakes are glaring.",1124928000,13,3400,4.5499181669394435
2275245,5,B0009B16TO,"I struggled with the decision to buy the DVD set in the original black & white or color.  I have seen some earlier films that have been colorized and I did not like them but I am happy to report that ""Bewitched"" in color has surpassed my expectations.  From the very first episode, I just couldn't believe my eyes at how rich the colors were and how natural it looked.  I have a high definition upscaling DVD player and a 30"" HDTV and if there were going to be any flaws in the colorized version, I am sure they would have shown up on my set.  I was a huge fan of the show when I was a kid (born in 1964)and I have never seen any of season 1 or 2 in the original black and white.  I am falling in love with Elizabeth Montgomery all over again.  I do plan on purchasing Season 2, in color, as soon as it is available.",1124928000,11,816,3.9451219512195124
2275246,5,B0009B16TO,"The creativity behind Bewitched is wonderful...it is a must have on DVD! The argument about black-n-white vs. color is ridiculous. The teams who worked on adding color to the original were amazing artists. It amazes me how they did it! You can choose to watch the dingy, dark black-n-white if you think it is somehow better. But those who get the color version know they made the right choice!",1124755200,10,393,4.7101449275362315
2275247,5,B0009B16TO,"I cannot add any more praise than anyone else has added.  This is my favorite TV show of all time.  Elizabeth Montgomery, Dick York and Agnes Moorehead were a fabulous team.  Let's not forget forever lovable Marion Lorne, hysterically funny Alice Pearce and George Tobias.

It was a great series and it will last in our consciousness for a very long time.

ONE REALLY TINY goof:  On the DVD, Disc Two listing of Episode 10 called ""Just One Happy Family"", which presents Maurice Evans as Samantha's warlock father also named ""Maurice"", makes the mistake of calling him ""Victor"" on the inside jacket.  How ridiculous is that?  Whoever put the DVD together should really watch the show first, no?

Besides that silly, little goof on the DVD listing, I am so happy that we finally Bewitched for our collections!  It was overdue but probably delayed even more because of the movie tie-in.

2275258,5,B0009B16TO,"Well Packaged, well presented, and an excellent watch; tack on the fact that you are getting 36 episodes, and you are getting some major value.
For Myself, the main  enjoyment is in the memories, so I prefer the black and White version because it is in the form I saw the shows during re-runs. The debate over show starts is not an issue, because the starting animation is what I saw when I saw the re-runs of the show.
The Drama, the comedy, the emotional range in this excellent series done by one of the top creative teams of this period ( they also produced I LOVE LUCY, the Number 1 show of this kind).
The first few episodes have an experimental narrative that in one sense works, but ultimataly  failed to hit the audience well. From The start we have Sam's comments about giving up magic  and how she may ""taper off"", or the episode 2 comment of ""it'll never work"". I should note here that the sequence of the shows on disk vary to some airdate sequences. This may vary in some market  areas.
Disc one provides a very visible mistake where the boom is clearly in view. As the show progresses, the little joke vignettes get better and more precise. And we can see, also, more appearances of people who became  famous in a few years. Classic  lines abound, such as Episode  9's ""Throw down your magic and come out with your hands up"".
DISC 1 SPECIAL FEATURE:  ""The Magic Unveiled: Part One"", which discusses the ""Rules"" of the show, and the story  behind the creation of the ""Twitch""  that Sam  does.
By the time I got to disc 2, one thing is very evident: or should I say not evident... the wire-work is invisible !! Where-as in MY FAVORITE  MARTIAN, the wire work is clearly visible, BEWITCHED does ""magic"" by some very innovative techniques, which may include some stop motion animation.
Disc 2 SPECIAL: ""The Magic Unveiled: Part 2"", ... Various background stories to Darrin, Endora, Clara, and details such as the speed of how each episode was shot  ( 3 and a half days).... and also, the series includes many firsts in how couples were  depicted in and on TV.
Disc 3 has the appearance of Paul Lynde as a highlight, amongst many highlights; quite amazing condsidering that Paul becomes Uncle  Arthur in Season 2. There is also a superb highlight of Aunt Clara, both dramatically and emotionall a superb piece that is both great fun, and touches on some human interest  points that make a wonderful episode work on many levels.
Disc 3's Special: MAGIC AND MISHAPS ; This is a superb Blooper reel, and co-star list, and is it ever a great co-star list of star's of the then future.
Disc 4:  continues the great  shows. No Extras on this disc except some very useless promos, with the exception of the last Christopher Reeve work ""THE BROOKE ELLISON STORY"", from the promo a wonderful looking film.

As for the Set of BEWITCHED: I hope you become superbly entranced by this masterpiece, and watch the series how it was intended to be seen IN BLACK AND WHITE.... filmed in Black and white, Designed in Black and White, and Genius personified in Black and White. Keep the colour for the later series.

Secondly, I really don't understand what's all the fuss about people urging people to buy the black and white version of the series. In my opinion, if you get the colorized version, you get the choice of watching the colorized series or the black and white version (by adjusting the colour parameters of your TV set). The colorization process is based on the different shades of grey of the original source, so they shouldn't be altered.

I have always had a blast watching this show; I just love the interaction between Endora and Darrin! I highly recommend this set to anyone who's ever enjoyed this show.",1124150400,6,751,4.681818181818182

This show has, in our opinion, really stood the test of time.  The characters are great and the storylines varied.  We both remembered seeing it in colour so opted for the colour despite a few other customers saying that colourisation was not great.  The only thing we noticed was a little greyness around the mouth sometimes when people were speaking but this did nothing to detract from our enjoyment.

We are both of one mind that, if the series was supposed to be in color, it would have been made that way (color WAS available then, and obviously, for budgetary or other reasons, wasn't used).

2275268,5,B0009B16TO,"I have long awaited the release of Bewitched Season 1 on DVD and it was all worth the wait! Here's why:

First, many of the episodes simply do not make it into syndication circulation where I live. The only episode in which Samantha breaks into tears is worth at least half a box of tissues. And at last, I got to see Samantha visit Santa Claus, something I haven't enjoyed since I was a child!!!

Second, the black and white episodes are far superior to the later colored episodes because they convey, in incidental music as well as cinematography, a certain romantic, film noir-ish quality that the later 'modern' episodes lack, for all their colored 'realism.'. To compare them side by side is to see a pivotal transition in the history of television.

And last, the interviews with the surviving cast members are, well, a treat... a postcard from beloved family members we haven't seen in years.

The original Darrin, (Dick York) with the beautiful Elizabeth Montgomery, show their incredible talents as comedic as well as dramatic actors.  There is a warmth to their performances along with the excellent acting of all other performers in the show.

It is amazing to watch a show some fourty years post airing that ascribed to life's happiness, while knowing that most of the actors' personal lives were quite tragic in their end.  However, it seems that most of their lives ended with dignity and grace.",1123200000,7,555,4.75

2275273,3,B0009B16TO,I love this show! Bewitched has and always will be one of my favorite shows and I have always loved watching both the black & white and colour seasons. Like other reviewers who love the black and white seasons of this show I was curious to see how different the colourized DVD looks from 80's colourization so I bought this and while it was fun to see the episodes colourized I prefer the original black & white so I'm going to trade my colourized boxed set for a black & white boxed set.,1123027200,10,488,4.258064516129032
2275274,4,B0009B16TO,Bewitched is a good show and I fondly recall watching reruns of this classic sitcom when I was a kid in the 70s though I had never seen the first season because either the channel that showed the reruns never showed the first season or I had missed it so I didn't see the first season until I caught it on TV Land or Nick @ Nite. I love old black and white movies and TV shows and I recently purchased the first season and I took a change and selected the colorised version and it is a lot better than the colorised versions I had seen of of black and white movies and TV shows in the 1980's but it still has some kinks that need to be fixed. I agree with others that the flesh tones look more natural but I also agree with the reviewers who said it still looks a little fake sometimes but you have to admit it's better then what was done in the 1980s.,1123027200,7,852,3.9883040935672516

The only slight disappointments are the lack of extras such as original sponsor openings from Quaker Oats and Chevrolet and commercials the cast did for the sponsors. Also not seeing the original animated cartoon which had the kitchen set with a door and separate stove, as well as the cat being a light gray rather than black. (The cartoon you see is simply a b&w version of the 1966 opening--which is seen also in the copyright.) But these are minor considerations that hopefully Sony will rectify in future releases. I sure hope we get the correct theme songs for each season, rather than hearing the same season 1 theme for each of the Dick York years as we have now in syndicated reruns.

2275293,5,B0009B16TO,"This first season from 1966 is an utter delight.  This is the year the Beatles were on the charts with ""Paperback Writer,"" ""Nowhere Man"" & ""Eleanor Rigby"" and the nation was experiencing questions of civil rights & Vietnam with LBJ in the White House.  Surprisingly, in hindsight, ""Bewitched"" seems to be from a simpler more wholesome time.  The colorization is excellent.  Only once did I detect a distraction as Darrin who is shown 2 times in a blue-tinted t-shirt suddenly has on a white one then back to blue.  The DVD extras are interesting with interviews and the one segment showing where the boom mic was included in the shot and Samantha's hairstyle switching back and forth from mussed to neat.  What most impressed me was the amazing cast of the minor characters that zooms past on reruns.  In ""Witch or Wife"" where Samantha meets Endora for lunch in Paris only to run into Larry Tate, Darrin then takes a plane for Paris.  While we only see her derriere, the stewardess who waits on Darrin is Raquel Welch.  In ""Your Witch Is Showing"" his secretary is Peggy Lipton who went on to be a series regular on ""Mod Squad.""  My very favorite episode is ""There's No Witch Like an Old Witch"" that ends Disc 3.  Addressing issues of aging with the marvelous Marion Lorne as Aunt Clara, Samantha's favorite aunt becomes a loved baby sitter, only to be accused of incompetence for telling the children she's a witch.  It's one of the most heartwarming episodes.  The first year's writing is crisp and the special effects tantalize and punctuate the interplay of relationships.  Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha is funny, caring & beautiful with great emotional connection with the host of characters that pass through the episodes.  Dick York as Darrin has excellent comic timing with some of the widest eyes and most amazing double takes you'll ever see.  As Endora, Agnes Morehead is simply a jewel with her dramatic flare.

Colorization still can't capture the distinctive pink of actors' mouths (gums and tongues in particular), but everything else has been mastered.  Purists may gripe at the colorization process, but it is undeniably fascinating to fade the color on your TV, which allows you the opportunity to compare and, most importantly, choose which version you want to see.

Viewers who grew up seeing BEWITCHED in reruns -- especially toward the end of the show's run -- will be amazed to see how grounded and subtle the writing and acting was during the first season.  Before the series began repeating on itself (dozens of episodes were refilmed word-for-word), before its cast lapsed into caricature and its scripts degenerated into week-after-week of ""What rodent will Endora turn Darrin into next?"", BEWITCHED was a pointed attempt to mirror the strife of a nation beset by prejudice.

Witchcraft was a clever platform -- worlds removed from the racial, sexual and gender issues we faced in the 1960s, but a gentle, effective thorn in our side nonetheless.  What people forget is that there was blind prejudice on both sides of BEWITCHED.  While the mortals perceived witches as evil, crooked-nosed crones, Samantha's family viewed mortals with equal disdain.  The first season of BEWITCHED used special effects with restraint and focused instead on the emotional and practical conflicts born of this ""mixed marriage.""

It's no secret that the show went on about four years too long, but the beguiling initial season stands as one of television's brightest hours.  It's calm, focused and -- when compared to the many seasons that followed -- a painful reminder of what can happen when a TV series doesn't know when to bow out gracefully.",1122681600,7,2009,5.094512195121951

Watching it in black and white really brought back memories of the good old days.  My 12 year old daughter is now getting to enjoy the show too!  Worth every penny!,1122508800,6,274,4.530612244897959
2275312,5,B0009B16TO,"I remember watching Bewitched as a child, laughing and being fascinated by Samantha Stephens: the housewife with the powers of a witch. Elizabeth Montgomery was so memorable in her portrayal that 20 years later I was compelled to purchase this first season on DVD.

Bewitched is the story of moderately powerful witch, Samantha Stephens and her very mortal husband, Darrin Stephens.  The first episode: ""I, Darrin, Take This Witch Samantha,"" opens with a montage of how these two TV Land iconic love birds met, courted and wed.

But what makes Bewitched a classic is that as an adult you actually experience it on a different level.  Because Bewitched is actually speaking to themes subtextually that aren't necessarily apparent when you watch it as a child.

And this subtext is where the story really begins: with Samantha breaking it to Darrin that she's actually a witch.  What's chilling is that the show began airing in the late 1960's and the metaphors of mixed or interracial marriage, within the context of the 1960's civil rights movement, is evident in Darrin's initial and shocked reaction.  Darrin finally comes to terms with Samantha being ""different,"" by issuing the edict that she hide her ""uniqueness"" by forbidding her to practice witchcraft.

This theme is the crux of the entire series of, Bewitched.  Samantha's natural inclination to be herself, i.e., be witch and use witchcraft when necessary, and Darrin's man-of-the-house authoritarian command that she stop using it and assimilate into being a ""normal"" suburban housewife.  And we watch, over the course of the series, Darrin's command slowly erode because one, Samantha can't help being who she is, a great witch, wife and mother; and two, Darrin's love for his wife allows him the perspective if not the subconscious realization that we can't change the people we love, specifically if the change we're asking diminishes their natural talents, abilities or cultural heritage.

In the sobering but funny episode 4 entitled: ""Mother Meets What's His Name,"" Samantha's mother, the powerful witch Endora, played to perfection by the late and wonderful Agnes Moorehead, meets Darrin face-to-face for the very first time.  Once pleasantries are exchanged an argument quickly ensues between Endora and Darrin when Endora asks Darrin, ""Why do you object to my daughter being herself, young man (referring to Samantha's use of witchcraft)?  And Darrin replies, ""I like Samantha the way she is, Endora.  She doesn't need any of that other nonsense.""  Endora straightens her back and looks Darrin in the eye and says, ""Nonsense?  Samantha is what she is, young man.  And that you cannot change.""  Thus beginning the best husband-mother-in-law power struggle ever seen on TV.

Outside of the social commentary Bewitched makes, it is a wonderfully humorous show with a great supporting cast of Alice Pearce and George Tobias who play neighbors Abner and Gladys Kravitz as well as the incomparable Marion Lorne who plays the bumbling, well-meaning Aunt Clara to perfection.

The comedy is clean, smart, and tastefully done.  The edge is in the subtext, everything else is pure fun.

So if you're in the mood for great family humor and a look back at the underlying social messages the writers and cast delivered between laughs this black and white version of Bewitched is a gem.  Five Stars.",1122422400,9,3356,5.1286764705882355

2275315,4,B0009B16TO,"I have watched and enjoyed ""Bewitched"" in reruns all of my life. These black and white shows are the ones that have always been the most difficult to see as they get aired so rarely. I am quite happy that they have decided to release the entire first season but I was troubled a bit by some of the reviews and complaints I have read here.

After purchasing and viewing most of the episodes on my new ""Bewitched: The Complete First Season"" set, I too noticed the Roman numerals showing a date of 1966 on the opening credits (a fact some others who left reviews here have pointed out). This made me wonder what the real opening credits for the first two seasons were really like.

After a quick Google search I discovered the real season one credits would have included mention of that week's sponsor within the animation. So what we see on this DVD set is not what viewers back in 1964 would have seen. Apparently Nick-At-Nite used the original credits (minus sponsor names) when it first aired the black and white seasons so they must still exist. I am a bit disappointed that Sony didn't take the time to use the real credits. If they felt the '66 credits were okay to use it still would have been nice if they would have included some footage of the original credits as an extra (in the same way the ""I Love Lucy"" sets contain original Philip Morris opening and closing credits).

I also discovered that there was a nose twitching sequence used to break to commercials when the shows originally aired. I have never seen this sequence before and would have loved this to have been included as an extra too.

Sony has also stuck it's newest logo onto the end of every show thus replacing the original Screen Gems logos. Again it would have been more historically accurate to have kept the original Screen Gems ID. I wouldn't have cared if Sony felt a need to tack on it's logo along with the original Screen Gems ID.

I hope that in it's Season Two DVD set Sony includes the above mentioned missing footage at the very least as extras. It would be kind of cool too if they were to add other archival footage pertaining to the series and perhaps any TV commercials that may still exist for ""Bewitched"" merchandise. I know I may be dreaming to ask for this one final thing but it would be great too if they could work out a deal with Hanna-Barbera to include the ""Flintstones"" episode that featured Samantha and Darrin.

Even without the above mentioned missing footage this set is a great deal and worthy of four stars. The packaging is nice and compact and all four discs fit into two slim cases withing a nice cardboard sleeve. Overall a very good presentation on Sony's part.

Just for the record I'll admit I purchased the black and white set and not the colorized version. I have no problems with anyone wanting to get the colorized versions. To Sony's credit I will point out that I am glad they didn't cut corners and released the two versions. I hope they do the same with the next season as well.",1122249600,13,3004,4.460837887067395

Well after a long while and reading all the reviews [thanks everyone your reviews were all helpful]

I decided to go with the color and I am so very happy with it. The colorization is beautiful. I have to say it is mostly because of 'Endora' that makes the colorized version so stunning. I think which ever way you were to decide you would be happy with both. Remain a purist and chose black and white, but if you cannot decide, then I would go with the colorized version, only because you will not be disappointed.

If possible I wish they would of had a blooper reel or behind the scenes added in with the set. But except for that little no nothing disappointment this is 5 stars. I purchased the black and white version and I believe I made the better choice. The picture is so clean and crisp. No colorized system can match. There are a lot of episodes in this set that I don't remember seeing before, and I thought I seen them all. As a young child my mother and I would watch Bewitched repeats in the afternoon. She was a true fan. Which may be why the house I grew up in had a front door just like the Stephens and a Rembrandt painting next to it. The painting will appear in later seasons. The show is intelligent and funny. Not campy or dated like other shows that appeared soon after. Shows like ""All in the family"", which according to the A&E ""Biography"" claimed to have helped the demise of non-reality based shows like Bewitched with its oh so important news of the day opinions and self righteous meat-head.

2275335,5,B0009B16TO,"I was reluctant to buy the colorized version of one of my favorite sitcoms of all time.  But I couldn't find the Black and White version available in anywhere except Amazon.  I didn't want to wait for it so I went ahead and bought the ""colorized"" version.  (I would never do this with Black and White films....I deplore their colorization).  But I was pleasantly surprised.  The colors look very natural, better in some episodes than others, but still very, very fine nonetheless.  Some of the hues are muted....especially the Stephens's front door.  But for the most part, the colorization was very, very well done in this case.  As for the series itself, what can I say that hasn't already been said.  In its initial season we are introduced to the most magical sitcom of all time starring the incomparable Elizabeth Montgomery, the definitive Darrin, Dick York, and of course, the inimitable Agnes Moorehead as Endora.  In later episodes we are introduced to Maurice (Sam's father) and Aunt Clara (Marion Lorne) as well as Phyllis and Frank (Darrin's parents).  Also prevalent are Abner and Glady's Kravitz (played by George Tobias and in this first season by the wonderful Alice Pearce, who would go on to win an emmy for her role after she died of cancer in 1966 shortly after the second season was over.  This series is one of the greatest sitcoms of all time and it is timeless.  It was an imaginative, well-written series which garnered several emmy's, nominations and awards.  It was ABC's biggest hit during the 1960s.  The perfect ensemble cast complete with fun loving and unforgettable characters is a welcome respite from the horrible casts of today's sitcoms.  Bewitched left us a lasting legacy....Elizabeth Montgomery was a beautiful classy lady who was kind, compassionate and never garnered a reputation for being difficult.  How refreshing it is to have the star of a popular sitcom who is not on a star trip!  Get this DVD series.  All the episodes are intact, uncut and remastered perfectly.  In Classic Black and White or The Colorized Version, Bewitched still packs a wallop 41 years later.  That is the case with classic shows done with intelligent production, acting, writing and directing!  I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to be released.",1121385600,8,2274,4.897905759162303

The store that I bought it in had only the colorized version, so I took a chance and bought it anyway. I was not displeased at all. The colorized version was done excellent.

I grew up with these original episodes, and seeing them in color was almost like viewing them for the first time.  I highly recommend this color boxset to everyone. Some have suggested that colorization be banned, which in my opinion is very narrow-minded.  These color episodes will attract a whole new generation of viewers who might have otherwise passed on B&W programs.  If you love the B&W, by all means get it.  If you want color, get it.

Remember that back in those days, there was no incentive to spend the extra money to shoot a series in color. Most people had B&W TVs...and the color TVs that were out left much to be desired compared to today's standards. It wasn't a matter of ""art"" to shoot in B&W; it was just economics.

I'm amazed at how decent the colorization process is in this set. Eye colors are natural looking; even the sandwiches they eat in one show look as if they were originally filmed in color.

It's not perfect, but it's pretty darned close, as well as being light-years ahead of what you used to see in colorized movies.

What are the ""cons""? The colors are not always vibrant, and have a tendency to be on the orange-ish side. Infrequently, you see obvious B&W bleed-through, especially in night scenes.

On the other hand, Endora is so colorfully brilliant, it's hard to believe that she was originally black and white. All in all, I can't imagine anybody being disappointed with this DVD set.

Funny enough...I may actually prefer the color...its a good job...a bit non real but neither were the Doris Day / Rock Hudson movies of the early 60's and this color job looks like it kept that in mind.  This show wasn't filmed as mini film noirs like the before mentioned twilight zone...its supposed to be colorful and breezy and frankly I think  benefits from color.  The ""Hogan's Heroes"" set that recently came out I think lost a bit when they went from B/W for the pilot to ""real"" color for the series...it moved a bit away from war drama/comedy and straight into slapstick...but Bewitched is slapstick and colorful and wel...there are my two  cents.

I own  the black and white to be truthful to the original...but will most likely view the color more often.

I grew up watching Bewitched with my mom-yes the originals-and yes, in black and white-but I feel that colorization does this show justice. Yea, it's not ""ORIGINAL"", but I personally find it an enhancement. I had both to choose from and I chose the colorized version. I am, for one, very appreciative that I am being offered both choices. Black and white is an option if you prefer or are set on having the series as it originally aired. In my opinion, the ""MAGIC"" of the show is enhanced by colorization. The clothes, decor and hair colors help set the scene for all those colors associated with the 60's. I would like to add that I am not just a fan of colorization. I love black and white too! For instance, I would never want THE TWILIGHT ZONE in color. I feel black and white helps create the creepiness in this series. However, In BEWITCHED, colorization is enhancing to the shows. They did a beautiful job of it too!

What is really confusing is that although amazon is selling both of them and clearly advertized, most retailers are selling one or the other. So it is quite possible that someone could buy the B & W version, not realizing the other existed, and visa versa. Too bad both versions couldn't be incorporated into the same set so that people had the choice and also could see the quality of the colourization. It would be very disappointing to buy the colour one only to find out it was not well done.
This was one of my favourite series when I was growing up. It is very humourous, witty, and very good family entertainment.

So it is quite possible that someone could buy the B & W version, not realizing the other existed, and visa versa. Too bad both versions couldn't be incorporated into the same set so that people had the choice and also could see the quality of the colourization. It would be very disappointing to buy the colour one only to find out it was not well done.

2275370,5,B0009B16TO,"After hearing about Sony Pictures decision to release two versions of Season 1 I was appalled. I grew up watching this TV Series in iots original black and white version and I have watched reruns of this series more times than I can count. Nevertheless, this show has remained my favourite television series of all time.

When the boxed set was released I had tried calling around. Neither Target, Best Buy nor Circuit City carried the Black and White version. It seemed to me that Sony Pictures was hellbent on force feeding everyone the colorized version of this boxed set and so I eventually had to order the Black and White version from Overstock.com.

After waiting impatiently for the boxed set, I was so excited to watch this first season from beginning to end and I was thrilled to death. I have never laughed so hard at watching the antics of Agnes Moorehead as our favourite mother, Endora. I think the most touching episode had to be when Maurice Evans who played Samantha's warlock father, Maurice, made an appearance.

Hopefully, and god-willing, Sony Pictures won't take forever in releasing the following season sets as Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox has been in releasing them.",1120176000,5,1199,4.839024390243902

2275372,4,B0009B16TO,"Colorization:

I really enjoyed watching the first season in color after only ever seeing it black and white.  Yes, I know.  They were filmed originally in black and white on black and white stock.  But, I must say that the colorization of this series is done quite well (better than I've seen so far).  Attention to detail in the colorization can sometimes be missing (fingernails).  As well, they didn't always get Samantha's hair color or skin tone correct.  There were times were it was quite obvious that it was colorized.  There were also times were I thought I was watching color film.  The real issue, however, is the skin tones.  The skin tones were just not accurate much of the time... usually too pink (and no, adjusting the tint doesn't really help).

However, because we have color reference in later seasons, it definitely made it a lot easier for the studio to colorize it.  And, if you don't like the color, just turn it down on your set and, viola, you have a black and white DVD set.

The only thing I kept wondering was... How did they know that that dress/coat/sweater/blanket was really that color?  Did they guess or did they have actual reference?  I do have to commend the colorization staff for picking clothing colors that really worked 99% of the time.

Sound:

The sound on this set is actually quite clear (with the exception of one episode that was rather odd).  Overall, I was impressed with the sound quality of the DVD set.

Episodes:

What can I say about them?  The show is just as enchanting today as it was when it was new.  I also personally feel these episodes were enhanced by the colorization, but that's just my opinion.  Especially in the episodes where the script talked about color (blue eyes, green scarf, blue and white tie, etc).

Filming:

The only thing that suffered in the translation to color was the lighting.  Apparently, the black and white stock needed such stark bright lighting that when colorized, this fact stands out dramatically.  In fact, there were certain episodes that the shadows were so black as to make you think they were outside in midday sun (there weren't enough fill lights) when they were standing indoors.  Plus, you could tell where the lights were in the scene when someone would walk off camera (it would practically blind the camera as they got too close to the light).  I don't seem to recall this when watching them in black and white.

Picture Clarity:

They definitely pulled this from excellent masters.  With the exception of the pilot, which had a line scraped into the filmstock throughout much of the reveal scene, the rest of the episodes were practically crystal clear.  For as old as this film is, I'm glad to see it has been preserved so well.

Overall:

I'm suitably impressed by the color DVD set and would recommend it for anyone who can be opened minded with regards to the colorization.  I only give it four stars because of the off colors on the skintones in places and the occasional oddity in colorization and a few other minor imperfections.  On the other hand, there were times I was thinking, was this episode really filmed in black and white?",1120176000,6,3149,4.6703096539162114

I bought the color DVDs and have watched them already - thinking that the color version is definitely a plus! All Turner colorization debates aside - the episodes lend themselves to a color version simply due to the campy clothes, furniture and backdrops wonderfully! Endora is simply not as enchanting in black and white - you must have the fire redhead, and purple and green gown!  The color set is as campy as the series - the black and white is for the purists!  I am glad that this set even OFFERS the option - most DVD series do not!  Buy the color version if you want the added camp - buy the B/W version if you want the original experience... but you will not get the true sense of green shag carpet!

Isn't there room for everybody's opinion and choice out there?  Some people prefer one, some prefer the other.  Let it be and just be happy it was released in the first place.  I hope future seasons are released in both formats to give fans a choice.  Sit back and enjoy, whichever version you chose to buy.

2275376,5,B0009B16TO,"The first season DVD relase of ""Bewitched"" is a great reminder of what a wonderful television series it was.  It had superb writing and direction, but above all it had memorable characters portrayed by outstanding actors.

Elizabeth Montgomery is perfect as Samantha, the witch who wants to be a normal housewife, but can't help but twitch from time to time. Dick York is the definitive Darrin Stephens.  York could be incredibly romantic and spasically funny often within minutes.  He and Montgomery had incredible screen chemistry together.  Agnes Moorehead is brilliant as Endora, the witch of a mother in law who doesn't support her daughters decision to marry a mortal--and as a consequence is often the conflict on the show.  David White is too often unsung as Larry Tate the money grubbing boss of Darrin.  But with White in the role, we sympathize and even like Tate--that ""son of a gun.""  Marion Lorne is superb as the dithering, but lovable Aunt Clara.  Alice Pearce is hilarious as busy-body Gladys Kravitz with veteran actor George Tobias a fine counter balance as her never believing husband, Abner.  Maurice Evans is sauve and hammy as Samantha's sauve and hammy father, Maurice (note on the DVD package they say his name is ""Victor"", but that was only a name used in the early planning and then discarded).

The early episodes carefully build on one another in examining the relationship between Samantha and Darrin.  Among the best episodes are ""Mother Meets What's His Name"" (the look on Agnes Moorehead and Dick York's face as they meet for the first time is priceless), ""Help, Help Don't Save Me"" (which demonstrated for the first time that Darrin and Sam could fight like no other couple in television history and then make up in the most romantic fashion).  ""Witch or Wife"", ""Just One Happy Family"", ""Samantha Meets the Folks"" and perhaps the definitive ""Bewitched"" episode, ""A is for Aardvark""--with a memorable performance by Elizabeth Montgomery.

The quality of the B/W tapes I have is excellent as is the sound.  The extras are all interesting.  I only wish they did a few commentary on specific episodes.

A wonderful set to spend many hours enjoying.",1120003200,6,2178,4.93956043956044

It looked so real!  Plus it's nice to see Alice Pearce in color (she was my favorite Mrs. Kravitz).

Now...here's the one fault I can find in the colorization:  Larry Tate was pale with white hair.  In the colorized version he has a very flesh tone/peachy complexion.",1120003200,8,576,4.524271844660194
2275378,5,B0009B16TO,"It's a delight to watch Bewitched again after so many years. It brings back memories of a happier, more innocent time. Elizabeth Montgomery looks more charming than ever in this initial season, and so much younger than I've ever remembered her.

This debate over the merits of ""Original Black & White"" or ""Colorized"" versions has left a sour taste in the mouth. I am firmly in the camp of seeing films or TV programs in the way they were shot. Techniques for shooting for B&W and for color differ. Just the fact that Bewitched was shot in B&W because Screen Gems was too cheap to pay for color, does not mean that it should be colorized. Just because it was shot on a quick schedule of just 3-4 days does not mean that efforts were not made to optimise the shoot for B&W. Shooting for B&W or color are very different processes. Colorizing a film or TV show originally shot in black and white simply bastardizes the show. There is no artistic integrity involved. It is solely for the money. The colorization trend among studios is simply pandering to the lowest common denominator. Unfortunately most audiences are simply attracted to bright colors. You could paint Samantha green and they would say, ""Oh what a pretty shade of green.""

I personally would only buy the original B&W. If Sony had released only a colorized version, I would have avoided the series entirely. It's no big loss. Sony has packaged all 36 half-hour episodes onto 4 separate DVDs. These are fitted into 2 custom-made plastic cases held within a slimline cardboard box that is about the thickness of a standard DVD keepcase. Picture quality is very good. Considering that this is over forty years old, it is close to excellent. Sony has gone back to the original film elements and done a commendable restoration. There are still occasional nicks, dirt specks and an odd streak or two (including an irritating vertical line down the center of the screen during the pilot episode) but the image quality is otherwise close to pristine. Image quality does vary between episodes, the worst example being ""A Vision of Sugar Plums"" which is marred by heavy shimmering grain, a generally soft image and a recurrent vertical line running down the right half of the frame. On the whole however, Bewitched has never looked this good before. It's like watching a film print. Natural grain is evident throughout. Black levels are spot on and give an admirable richness and depth to the image. Grey scaling is exquisitely rendered. The level of intricate detail is exemplary. The restoration may not reach the level of Hollywood classics like Casablanca or Citizen Kane but for a TV sitcom it is outstanding.

I initially put links to external reviews here which analyse the colorized and B&W versions but Amazon has seen fit to remove them so I will rephrase what they have said. Essentially in the colorized version, a certain level of fine detail is lost and black levels are compromised. The colors are NOT natural despite what some of the reviewers here insist. Especially bad are the reproduction of skintones - the colorized skintones are taken from an obviously generic palette of pink shades. This is not to say that native color films have natural skintones. Many also do not, because skintones are notoriously difficult to reproduce. But the colorized version is obviously artificial. Buyers of the colorized version do however have the advantage of extra Portuguese and Spanish audio tracks as well as alternate Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese and Thai subtitles. Sony has probably decided that the colorized version would be the one to push worldwide. Apparently the Region 2 release will only consist of the colorized version. It's a sad fact that most audiences gravitate towards color TV programs whether they were originally in color or not.

For the so-called ""common-sense"" crowd, please do not tell people who want to get the original B&W versions to ""simply"" buy the colorized ones and ""simply"" turn down the saturation or ""turn off the color"". It may surprise some of you to know that some TV sets don't have that ability, some cannot ""turn down"" the saturation all the way and for those with carefully calibrated home theater systems, the phrase ""simply turn down the saturation"" is met with a gasp of utter horror.

Sound for the B&W version is limited to the original English 2.0 mono track. It is thin and rather tinny but otherwise clean and clear. Only English subtitles are provided here. There are minimal extras. The most substantial ""The Magic Unveiled"", is split into a 7 minute Part 1 on Disc One and an 8 minute Part 2 on Disc Two. There is a 7 minute long bloopers segment entitled ""Magic and Mishaps"" as well as several trailers including one for ""Bewitched - The Movie"". But ultimately, it's for the series itself that buyers will be getting this set and after almost half a century, Bewitched proves that it is still a magical delight. An altogether excellent buy.

Note: About the opening credits - They are not the originals. They are lifted from the 1966 Third Season. The 1966 Third Season was in color. So what we get on the credits of the B&W set is a ""desaturated"" greyscale version of the originally color opening credits. That's why the quality looks poorer than the rest of the show. The reason Sony used the Third Season credits is because the original seasons ran with ""sponsored"" credits advertising the likes of ""Quaker Oats"" and ""Chevrolet"". It seems that for either legal, monetary or trademark reasons, they opted not to include them in this set.",1120003200,15,5558,4.826862539349423

I do want to say I am a little surprised about all this banter about color vs. black and white!  I have been out of the loop and didn't even know Bewitched was being relased so when I saw it in the store I grabbed it, not even thinking of the coloring of the program.  When I got it home I noticed it said in Color and knew right away they must have colorized it.  When I popped it into the DVD player, I was astounded at how true and natural the colors were!  I kept having to remind myself that this show was made in B&W originally.  It was really kind of fun to see how the first season would have looked had it been filmed in color originally as the producers had wanted it to be.  For those complaining about the colorized version, buy the Black and White one.  Be thankful one was released.  For the rest of us, I am happy to have Bewitched on DVD and thrilled with the quality of the colorization that Sony did to it.

2275383,5,B0009B16TO,"There is a lot of mis-information in the reviews about this DVD set, so I want to clear some things up.  My review is based on the colorized set. (I watched Bewitched faithfully when it ran in the 1960's on the ABC network- Thursday nights, and I have about 30 episodes on tape from the original Network 16mm prints with which to compare this DVD set.)

One review states the colorized set is an edited version (22 minutes for each episode???) like they show on TV.  I believe the colorized set has the complete and uncut episodes, nothing has been edited. Here's why: Each episode on the DVD set runs about 25 1/2 minutes.  Originally the show was 26 minutes long.  So we're missing about 30 seconds on the DVDs.  The orignal cartoon sponsor opening (Chevrolet or Quaker Oats) ran 45 seconds.  The Cartoon opening on this DVD set(a syndicated 1966 version) runs 30 seconds. So all we are missing now is 15 seconds.  I believe those 15 seconds missing are the ""Bewitched back in a moment"" tag and the ""Bewitched brought to you by . . ."" tag at the end of the episode, as well as the Screen Gems ""dancing sticks"" logo after the end credits.  Sorry to be so technical about this, but I think I need to justify why I think the episodes are uncut. (Note to Sony Pictures for future seasons:  you would make alot more fans happy by including the original openings, Bewitched back in a moment, and the Screen Gems logo.)

The second thing I want to recommend is to give the colorized version a chance, don't count it out.  There is a lot of talk about being purists, the directors wanted it shot in black and white and we're altering their vision, etc.  I have one word for this: BOLONEY.  There was no vision for the Directors to shoot this in black and white.  The ABC network was CHEAP and decided to shoot these episodes in black and white (to save money).  And each episode was filmed in about 3 1/2 days, so there wasn't alot of time to discuss shadow placements or whatever with black and white film. I recommend getting the colorized version, Sony has done a terrific job, it looks completely real, and it only enhances the experience!

I am moved and amazed by how well these episodes hold up...and by how ridiculous the idea of remakes, spinoffs and ripsoffs are.  Clara, Endora, the Tates and Kravitzes are super and the chemistry between Samantha and Darrin, so perfectly played by Montgomery and York, are really moving!

It's wonderful to see the very primitive special effects, because it puts the burden of entertainment on the creativity of the production team.  Witty writing, innovative ideas and ensemble rapport will always win out over CGI!  Interesting, too, to see the aspects of early 1960s prejudice tackled in the guise of TV situation comedy.  They were both OF their time and AHEAD of it!  Too bad more TV today isn't as clever!

2275401,5,B0009B16TO,"First off let me say that I have been waiting years for Bewitched to be released on DVD and it has been worth the wait.  I have recorded most of the episodes on VHS tapes so I was delighted to have the first (and my favorite) season on tape.  I did not realized just how much TV Land and others have cut from the episodes we see now.  These have the entire show including great voice overs from an announcer at the beginning.  I am amazed how much they have cut over the years.  I am seeing things I never have seen before.  The quality is wonderful and the additional DVD extras are fun!

As far as the B&W vs. Color thing... I like to see them the way they were done... in Black and White.  I would like to see how the color version looks to compair them. In fact, I did not know it came in color until I was looking at the information in the box and it said ""in color!""... I was confused and was thinking 'the first season was not in color?'...Then I realized what they did. Hey, I know people who will not watch B&W TV at all so if this makes them watch... then let them enjoy... but for me, I will stick to my B&W.

Enjoy!",1119571200,12,1127,3.9955357142857144
2275402,5,B0009B16TO,"There are other excellent Bewitched content reviews here, but I wanted to comment on the colorized version. I took a chance and purchased the colorized over the black/white original. I thought that since most of the series was in color, they had the correct color matching for the black/white first year, but one never knows. I was very pleased to discover that I made the right choice for me. The colorized Bewitched adds much to the wonderful episodes. The color is perfect. If you like your shows in color, you won't be disappointed at all. I'm glad I took the risk and it paid off.",1119571200,8,585,4.580952380952381

my first VHS machine in 1978 ($1200).  Colorization is vastly improved from 20 years ago when it was frequently a blurry pink blue and brown disaster where the colors often couldn't even keep up with the motion.  I bought the color Bewitched DVD set yesterday and one could not ask for finer color and picture quality.  And since 1966 and later seasons of Bewitched were filmed in color, with the same familiar Stephens' living room and actors, there exists a historically valid reference of what the color scheme and overall ""look"" of the show in color should be.",1119571200,10,631,4.709090909090909

In the controversy over B&W verses color, I have to say...please, do yourself a favor and buy the COLOR version.  I almost made the mistake of buying the B&W until, fortunately, I read the reviews here and realized color was even available.  I just received my color version in the mail and am thrilled at how stunning and realistic it is.  The mid-sixties fashions are awsome in color!  And here's the big secret:  If you're feeling nostalgic and want to view the first season in puritan B&W, simply turn off the color on your TV!  How simple!!!

Buy the color version, and have both!",1119484800,11,699,4.580645161290323
2275415,5,B0009B16TO,"I picked up the box set yesterday, and it is worth every single penny. I cannot rave enough about the excellent colourisation technique used on these original B&W episodes.  Congratulations to Sony on a job well done. You would never guess that it was originally B&W. While some reviewers feel Sony shouldn't have tampered with it, I just say ""turn off the colour"" and watch it in black and white then if you really must be a purist. I have to ask - why would anyone buy the B&W DVD version when in theory you can get both just by buying the colour DVD version.

Season 1 is full of beautiful episodes, and heaps of magic too.  The appeal of Elizabeth Montgomery shines through with every scene.  Agnes Moorehead is more prominent in Season 1, appearing in almost every second scene.  Season 1 does have a different feel to it than other seasons.  For example, some of Samantha's trademarks eg. when she says ""well?"" did not surface until Season 2.  Another thing I am noticing with Season 1 is that Darrin is not as cranky as he became from Season 2 onwards. He seems like a much gentler guy in Season 1, and much less angry when Sam uses her magical powers in Season 1. Another observation is that a different actor plays Gladys Kravitz (the nosey neighbour), and while she is quite good, you cannot beat the actress who took over the role in Season 2 onwards.

Overall, I highly recommend this brilliant colour version box set.  Remember, you can turn it to B&W if you really want to.  Buy now and enjoyboth just by buying the colour version!",1119484800,7,1545,4.485714285714286
2275416,5,B0009B16TO,I can't believe all this color vs black and white. Just get the one you like. I got both versions and both are wonderful. What a great show. The early seasons were the best. Hope SONY puts out every season fast.,1119484800,7,211,4.170731707317073
2275417,1,B0009B16TO,"I'll admit that I'm a purist. There, I've said it. The first season was definitely filmed in B&W and therefore, to me, that's how it should be seen. Granted, if there are those who are pleased with the ""colorized version"" and give it five stars, that's fine. However, why the 5 stars for those who are purists and really want it in b&w? I don't understand. I also don't understand since Sonce Sony put it out in both b&w and color, why is it so very hard to find the b&w version? Honestly, if they want to appeal to those of us who are purists, since Sony put it out in b&w, we, the consumer, ought t be able to find it somewhere. The original director produced every episode with the idea that this would be shown in b&w. He never intended color. Therefore, the positioning of people, the arrangement of objects, the colors that the characters wore were all designed for b&w. Colorizing it ruins it. It doesn't matter whether you like it in color because with color you're not getting the effect that the director wanted.",1119484800,16,1022,4.441489361702128
2275418,5,B0009B16TO,"Between 1964 and 1972, TV audiences were mesmerized by a lovely fictional witch named Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery, 1933-1995) who fell in love with an ordinary mortal named Darrin Stevens (for the first five seasons, played by Dick York, 1928-1992).  Initially, Darrin didn't know that Samantha was a witch and was initially frightened by the prospect upon learning about it, but his love for Samantha was very strong.  Equally in love with Darrin, Samantha promised not to use her powers and learn how to live as an ordinary mortal herself.  However, Samantha periodically found that using a little witchcraft from time to time wasn't a bad thing; especially when one of her relatives that didn't approve of her marriage with Darrin decided to pay a visit.  In particular, neither her mother, Endora (Agnes Moorehead, 1900-1974), nor her father, Maurice (regularly returning guest actor Maurice Evans, 1901-1989), were particularly fond of Darrin and often referred to him as ""What's His Name"", ""Dustbin"", ""Derwood"" or some other unflattering name.  However, Samantha's sensitive and very kind Aunt Clara (regularly returning guest actress Marion Lorne, 1883-1968), who had a penchant for collecting doorknobs, liked Darrin; but Darrin (and Samantha) would often get a little nervous when she paid a visit because her powers didn't always do what Aunt Clara expected.  Two of Samantha's other aunts who would visit less frequently were Aunt Agatha (occasional returning guest actress Georgia Schmidt, 1904-1997) and Aunt Bertha (occasional returning guest actress Reta Shaw, 1912-1982).  Recognizing the difficulties that could occur if other mortals found out that Samantha and her relatives were witches and warlocks, Darrin and Samantha do their very best to keep other mortals from learning their secret.  This includes Darrin's boss Larry Tate (David White, 1916-1990), his wife Louise (played in the first two seasons by Irene Vernon, 1922-1998), Darrin's often confused mother Phyllis (Mabel Albertson, 1901-1982) and his sensible father Frank (Robert F. Simon, 1908-1992).  After Darrin and Samantha purchase their house in the fictitious neighborhood of ""Morning Glory Cicle"", they must contend with a very nosy neighbor across the street by the name of Gladys Kravitz (first two seasons by Alice Pearce, 1917-1966); but her husband Abner (George Tobias, 1901-1980) always managed to keep her in check.

What made ""Bewitched"" such a wonderful show was the quality of the acting, the quality of the story writing (for at least the first 5 seasons), the very engaging and interesting characters and the comedy.  Sadly, Dick York had to leave show due to health reasons following the fifth season; but the show continued to be produced for an additional 3 seasons with Darrin being played by Dick Sargent (1930-1994).  Unfortunately, Dick Sargent wasn't as popular with fans as Dick York had been and in the closing seasons the writing began to suffer as stories from earlier seasons began to be repeated. Overall, though, the show was remarkably entertaining. The first season had 36 episodes, of which some of the most memorable include ""I, Darrin Take This Witch Samantha"" (the premier episode), ""Be it Ever So Mortgaged"" (when Gladys & Abner are introduced), ""Mother, Meet What's His Name"" (when Darrin meets Endora), ""Little Pitchers Have Big Fears"", ""The Witches Are Out"" (when Aunt Clara & Aunt Bertha are introduced), ""Just One Happy Family"" (when Maurice is introduced), ""And Something Makes Three"", ""Samantha Meets the Folks"" (when Darrin's parents are introduced), ""A Vision of Sugar Plums"" (Samantha personally knows Santa Clause, played by Cecil Kellaway, 1893-1973), ""It's Magic"", ""A Nice Little Dinner Party"", ""Your Witch Is Showing"", ""Eye of the Beholder"", ""Red Light, Green Light"" (when Gladys sees traffic lights), ""Which Witch Is Which?"", ""Pleasure O'Reilly"", ""There's No Witch Like an Old Witch"", ""Abner Kadabra"", ""Illegal Separation"" and ""Eat at Mario's"" (a personal favorite).

Overall, I rate ""Bewitched: The Complete First Season"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  Whether you decide to purchase it in its original black and white or colorized version, you'll be sure to enjoy each and every episode.",1119484800,9,4237,5.35187969924812
2275419,5,B0009B16TO,"Sony released DVD sets of these colorized episodes of BEWITCHED about a year ago in Japan. They included a special feature documentary about how they restored and colorized the first two seasons (Season's 1,2 & 3 were released almost simultaneously in Japan).  Apparently, they were colorized without altering the original B&W.  The original greyscale and density were not affected by the process.  So, yes..you can turn down the color on your set and view the eps. in their original B&W appearance. You can read a review about the colorized episodes and how they compare to season 3, which was the first season to be shot in color here: [...]

(An interesting note to this article is that each of the box sets in Japan were missing 1 or 2 episodes, reportedly due to an inability to restore the audio tracks to some scenes.  Yet, we get all 36 episodes released here in the U.S... how odd.)

This is why I chose the color set over the B&W.  Plus, I already owned several of the original B&W episodes on VHS from Columbia House, so being able to now see them in color makes them different & fun to watch.  Whichever you choose to buy, this show is one of the greatest sitcoms in television history.  The first two season's are the best.  There are even some elements of drama in some of these early episodes that seem to be missing from the writing as the series went on. Hopefully Sony will continue to release more seasons on DVD.",1119484800,3,1432,4.536964980544747

A note, however, to those people who say that if you don't like the ""enhanced"" version, just to turn off the colour on your television set.  Well, that doesn't work, really.  When colour is added, the original image is altered--values of light and dark are changed, etc.  So watching the colourized version on a black-and-white set will NOT give you the same effect as watching an original black-and-white print.",1119398400,13,674,4.767241379310345

But I don't know why Sony bothered to offer it in color and B&W versions. The old colorized shows are wretched, and it was originally filmed in B&W. So why offer the color? And why offer both if you can't walk into a store and actually have a choice? I wanted to buy the B&W the minute it came out, which is why I didn't order from Amazon. I wanted to be able to go into a store, buy it, take it home, and start watching it immediately! I went to Circuit City, Border's, and Best Buy yesterday, and none of them had the B&W version. Today I called every store within a 15 mile radius of where I live and no one had B&W. I'm happy that those who want to see it in color can do so if they choose. But why isn't it that simple for those of us who prefer the B&W, to get the version we want? I am not a ""complete phoney-baloney"" nor am I a ""politically correct snob"", as one reviewer previously put it. I simply happen to prefer this season in B&W, as it was originally filmed.

The sets are nearly identical (except for one audio feature on the colorized), but most brick and mortar stores are only carrying the colorized version.  This is unfortunate.  Do yourself a favor and get it in the format it was originally intended.  The colorization is not true to the original wardrobe or set colors, and it can really become distracting.  I especially dislike the way the mouths and eyes are not colored correctly.  It takes away from a show that has one of the best ensemble casts and directors in TV history.  I highly reccomend adding Bewitched to your DVD collection in the Black and White format.  It's nice that Sony gave fans a choice, but I find the colorized too distracting and would only buy Season 2 in the black and white format.

Episodes that are particularly good in this season are epi #1 (pilot), Be It Ever So Mortgaged, and A Is For Aardvark.  These are the 3 best shows of a glorious 8-year run of Bewitched.  Watch them today!",1119398400,14,1127,4.58

I think that these should have been digitally restored, much like the I Love Lucy episodes.  I realize the original I Love Lucy's were done in 16MM and these were probably not but more care could have been taken into touch up.

While I remember most of the episodes being in b/w, apparently only the the first and maybe the second seasons were filmed in b/w. I thought it would be cool to get to see all of the episodes in color, but part of me was torn when i found out sony had released two versions. I'm kind of a purist, and thinking I should really own the episodes in their original b/w. However, after reading all of the reviews, I found out that the quality of the colorization was actually really good. Someone said that we could just turn off the color on our tvs if we wanted to see it in b/w... i don't know when was the last time we had a tv that could do that! I think most tvs don't really have that option anymore.

anyways, i'm still torn over which version to get... but i'm definetly getting the whole set soon! and hopefully the other seasons will follow closely behind! (& I Dream of Genie)!",1119398400,4,984,4.262032085561497

Which to buy, witch to buy. And then as fate would have it, they didn't have the B&W versions on hand. So I looked over the box and thought the color looks pretty nice on the box... why not?

I'm a bit of a purist at heart so buying this version was quite tough. I have viewed all of two episodes, and while the first few seconds I was conflicted, I can truly see color is the way to go. At first you WILL BE a bit conscious of the coloring but then as time went on and I saw Samantha outside in the sunlight, I knew right then and there I had made the right desicion.

Overall, the box art and packaging is sparse and yet serviceable and the companies have finally seem to come up with a ""universal"" scheme with thin cases and an outward cardboard shell, and it does the job. Sadly, the cover art does highlight Sam a bit ""too much"". Though she was the star I would have preffered equal time with Derwood, perhaps cheek to cheek, with Endora as the background menace.

The first eps I watched are vague memories at best. The first episode being somewhat of a memory but the 2nd episode with them looking the house over I do not remember at all. It is such a treat to see the show in this way, to almost live through their beginnings. It's strange to see the house unfurnished and unlandscaped, it's kind of like all of America is moving in, at least us enlightened ones:)

There is so much to say that really doesn't need to be said. Elizabeth was as born for this role as Nimoy was for Spock, or Gleason was for Kramden. There is no way the magic that was created in this period will ever be duplicated, and I don't care how much you spend on effects because, while money can go a long way, it can't buy chemistry and heart.",1119312000,3,1884,4.153424657534247
2275441,5,B0009B16TO,"The first season of BEWITCHED makes it's DVD debut (timed to coincide with the Hollywood remake starring Nicole Kidman).  Relive all the great moments from this classic sitcom!

Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) meets Darrin (Dick York) and they fall in love.  There's only the smallest of catches...Sam's a witch!  There's also another spoke in the works: Samantha's imperious mother Endora (Agnes Moorehead) who cannot stand her daughter marrying a mere mortal...and insists on calling Darrin by the droll nickname of `Derwood'!

The first season introduces characters that would become staples throughout the run of the show like nosey neighbour Gladys Kravitz (originally played by Alice Pearce) and dotty old Aunt Clara (Marion Lorne).  Later on in the series, Elizabeth Montgomery relished the chance of playing a second character, Samantha's devious cousin Serena.

BEWITCHED is one of those classic shows that is always fun to revisit.  The DVD boxset of the first season is beautifully-presented.  Hopefully Season 2 and the remainder of the series will be released in the not-too-distant future.  In the meantime sit back and relax with Season 1 of this magical show.

I thought about getting B&W but ended up getting the color set and am so glad that I did. Episodes I'd seen before in B&W seemed fresh and new. I think they did a great job on the colorizing, despite other reviews. It's great to see the characters' clothes and the home setting in color. For those who are particularly fond of the later episodes that were originally in color, this colorized first season is consistent.",1119312000,5,511,4.565217391304348
2275443,5,B0009B16TO,"Ok, well we all know the show, witch marries a mortal and lives in suburbia. The show is one of those rare shows that took off right from the start. The first episode spends the first ten minutes setting up the plot and then goes right into what would be the show for the remainder of it's run. The on screen chemistry between the actors is what makes the show work. Samantha and mother Endora are totally believable as are Samantha and Darrin. And admit it, as a kid didn't you think even for a second that Elizabeth Montgomery really did have some sort of magical powers?? It's that kind of believability that made the show so great. There was one flaw with the series that never made sense. The Stephens' lived in Connecticut, yet for the Christmas episodes there are always leaves on the trees and bright blue skies. I've lived in New England my whole life and have never seen the trees in full bloom at Christmas!!! LOL! The first season presented here is available in either it's original b&w format or in the 80's colorized version. If you get it in b&w the print is pristine, if you get it in color it was done very well. It still has that coloring book look to it, but it's cool to see the first season shows in color. If you want to see them as originally shown, turn the color off on your set, it's that simple. For the record the first TWO seasons were done in b&w and starting with the third season it went to color. A great show, a great DVD set!",1119312000,,1460,4.274368231046932

I was told when they first announced that the show was coming out on DVD, that the Color version does not have the complete episodes. They are syndicated versions, where they cut out a couple of minutes of the original show and then they colorized it. Be careful if you are buying the color version because you might be dissapointed. I have seen the color versions on TV and they look awful...Grey teeth, etc. I am sorry that the B&W version is not readily available but it is available on Amazon and other sites.",1119312000,14,725,4.377777777777778
2275445,5,B0009B16TO,"The plethora of old movies, serials, and TV shows being placed on DVD today makes the enthusiast of such art gleeful.  One of my favorite shows as a young male was ""Bewitched"" staring the enchanting, charming, adorable, sexy, smart, and just plain cute, the one and only incomparable Elizabeth Montgomery.  There is not an American woman of the time that did not admire her, there was not a mother who would want for her for daughter, not a child who would adore her as mommy, and not one single red-blooded American male that did not desire and covet her for his own wife.  That Darrin, what a lucky guy, we all thought.

Loosely based on the movie ""Bell, Book, and Candle"" staring Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak, in which a normal mortal man falls in love with a real witch, ""Bewitched"" is classic 1960's sitcom.  The first show involves Samantha the witch, played by Elizabeth and Darrin the mortal man who falls in love with her, played very aptly by Dick York, and the roll in which will be a constant point of comedic drama in this show is introduced, the quintessential witch of a mother in law Endora, portraid in over the top casting by Agnes Moorhead.  Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they get married, but there is a slight complication.  To quote a line ""My wife is a witch.""

The first season of ""Bewitched"" has recently been released on DVD no doubt to coincide with the new movie of the same title.  This 4 disk set with 36 episodes is impeccable in it's transference to today's media.  And it is inexpensive, this treasure being had from 25 to 28 dollars.  Each half hour show is a chapter, and the first disk has an extra with all the old writers, directors, and producers making comment.  Sadly, both Elizabeth and Dick are gone and so could not be interviewed.  I remember when Elizabeth died of cancer at a young age, just in her 50's, not that long ago, and thinking how sad.

The first episode is the only one I have watched so far but it was such a comedic scream I just had to put my impressions down in words immediately.  This episode was deftly written, and the series created, by one of the masters of the sitcom, Sol Saks.  The gist is the short love affair (by the way the voice over narrative was done by the unmistakable baritone of Jose Ferrer-how odd) in which Samantha and Darrin meet, fall in love, and get married.  There is a brief but memorable intervention on their honeymoon of Endora trying to convince Samantha to stop being foolish, but she will have nothing of it.

She then tells Darrin she is a witch and proves it, they make love anyway.  He spends the next several days soul searching, and then says, what the heck-I love this girl, and she agrees to swear off witchcraft and become a normal American housewife.  That is until the old girl friend shows up.  What makes this episode all the more believable is the quaint but sweet way in which it is implied several times that Darrin just can't wait to get his new bride to bed.

Nancy Kovaks of wickedly delicious 1960's film and TV genre (she was the princess in ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and did an original ""Star Trek"" femme fatale cast as a witch doctor) plays the sophisticated past girl friend of Darrin's who invites the happy couple to her house for dinner with the express intent of humiliating the new bride.  Of course, Ms. Sophisto has no idea what she is dealing with, and Samantha, in one of the funniest ever skits on TV, turns the tide on Sheila (Kovaks).  This is classic TV and really shows off Elizabeth's comedic abilities in what amounts to just her facial expressions doing her dialogue.  Wow - she was such a doll.

Good stuff, highly recommended.  Take care not to get the currently released colorized version.  Stick with the black and white original.

2275446,5,B0009B16TO,"Here's my take on the B&W v. colorization issue.  This baby-boomer believes that you just don't alter history.  The original season of Bewitched was filmed in black & white, period.  Perhaps colorize the Dick Van Dyke series.  And this would stimulate young adults brains?  H'mmmm!  Young adults can't handle B&W?  Check out most music videos on MTV.  Has anyone seen the only color episode of ""Perry Mason"" or the color Christmas episode of ""I Love Lucy""?  Not many, I'll bet as they don't show them very often as they  just don't ""fit in"".

No, I believe in artistic integrety over colorization.  All that aside I guess content is the most important issue and I think everyone agrees that this is one gem not to be missed.",1119225600,17,724,4.658730158730159
2275447,5,B0009B16TO,"Another great television classic is about to debut on DVD in the form of Screen Gems' ""Bewitched"".  What makes this one different is that to my knowledge it is the first dual offering of both original black & white and colorized versions.  Personally I will only be buying the B/W version, as I am a purist and want to experience the material as close to the original television exhibition as possible.  I grew up with reruns of this show, but every station I ever saw it on only showed the color episodes from season 3 to the end of the series' run.  It wasn't until my parents got cable in the late 1980's and we started receiving Nickelodeon (who at the time only broadcasted the first two black and white seasons and nothing further) did I get to see any of the original episodes.  My mother had commented before when watching the color reruns that she had liked the original actress who played ""Gladys Kravitz"" better than Sandra Gould, but I never got to see who she was referring to until Nickelodeon.  Now these episodes from the first season will be available to own in their original uncut format, something I've NEVER seen.  I don't really enjoy colorized versions of original black and white material, but for those who do this release should please you very well.  Someone had commented about simply turning off the color of your TV set to watch the shows for those who don't want color, but since I have no desire to watch the originals in color anyway I will be buying the B/W.  At least this release will appeal to all audiences, and that is the important thing, right?  Another important thing is for all of us to support this release so the studio will not be disappointed and instead give us further seasons in a timely fashion.  It could be a long road to owning the entire series, so let's get out there and snatch these up so they will stay on the ball!",1119139200,9,1875,4.469208211143695

Classic and contemporary tv buffs should get this set, whether it be the colorized version or the black and white version, but i strongly suggest getting the colorized version if you don't want to see the color just take off the color from your TV sets that way you get the color and the black & white for free, and see how we use do it old-school style.

Bewitched who paved the way for other fantasy sitcoms deserves a permanent home in anyone' s collection. The set contains all the classic 36 episodes from season 1, which I believe the best season in Bewitched. The acting here is top rate as the cast gives their best performances, especially the two lead stars - York and Montgomery who shared a on-screen chemistry. The storylines, the musical scoring and the crude but satisfying visual effects contribute to the enjoyability of the show.

As an added bonus - the dvd contains several features;

* Fullscreen Presentation

* Language: English

* Featurettes: The Magic Unveiled

* Bloopers: Magic and Mishaps

* Full length Bewitched Theatrical Trailer

The show stars Elizabeth Montgomery who plays a good-natured, nose-twitching witch who falls in love and eventually marries a mere mortal Darrin Stephens (Dick York) much to the horror of Sam's mother Endora (Agnes Moorehead) who does everything in her power to wreck the marriage. With an arrray of memorable chracters (i.e. The Kravitz , notably Mrs. Kravitz played by Alice Pearce and dear old Aunt Clara played by Marion Lorne) makes this one of the most enduring, most beloved popular sitcoms in TV history.

I Just Hope Sony releases all 8 seasons of Bewitched and not just this one!",1117843200,10,1762,4.750819672131148
2275464,5,B0009B16TO,"Elizabeth Montgomery will always be most famous for her portrayal of the young pretty witch, Samantha.  Bewitched was a charming t.v. show in its day and still holds up even now.  You'll want to get the early seasons of this show while the original Darrin (Dick York) is still around.  Once Dick Sargeant takes over the role it's not nearly as funny.  Most of the other roles were pretty funny.  Agnes Moorehead as Endora was unforgettable as she tormented Dobbin, Durwood, I mean Darrin endlessly.  Uncle Arthur (Paul Lynde) was a scream everytime he visited Morning Glory Circle (the street Darrin and Samantha lived on).  Did you remember that?

Unfortunately, Elizabeth, York, and Sargeant are all dead now.  Montgomery died of cancer, York of emphysema and Sargeant of AIDS.  Bewitched was good clean fun of yesteryear.  We don't have much of that any more.

Big drawback is the colorization.  It takes your attention away from the show because youu keep sitting there scrutinizing the color and how off and imperfect it is.  I don't know why they felt it necessary.  Still I suggest you purchase it so you don't miss out on this little piece of history.",1117756800,9,1159,4.812182741116751
2275465,5,B0009B16TO,"To begin with, I have always hated colorization, right from the first time I was exposed to it in the late 1980s.  (I'm still reeling from the atrosities committed on ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in the name of colorization.  Lionel Barrymore's villainous portrayal of nasty Mr. Potter was utterly defaced by the explosion of pastels on scenes that were lit to be dark and dismal to begin with...To say nothing of the luminous peachy hue that was liberally applied to Barrymore's skin tone).

But the first season of ""Bewitched"" (originally filmed in black and white) is different.  First of all, the show's break-neck production schedule (complicated by the laborious execution of then-stunning special effects)obviated any heavily artistic or stylized lighting techniques that would be undermined by the transition to color.

But second, and more importantly, it just looks better than anything I'd seen colorized before.  And that's something I wasn't prepared for.

For example, although I never regarded ""Gilligan's Island"" as an artistic work, I was nonetheless annoyed by the attempt to colorize that show's first season: the skin tones lacked contrast, the jungle seemed an unrealistic and monochromous shade of green, and the costumes (virtually the same costumes, episode after episode) lacked the richness we'd become accustomed to in the real color episodes.

Not so with ""Bewitched.""  In fact, I didn't realize the first episode I saw had been colorized.  But it had.  And in such a way that it mirrored the color episodes.

Now, I will admit that after I realized that it had been colorized, I started scrutinizing each color, each shade, each scene, mostly out of astonishment. I was determined to find flaws.  And I think I found some imperfections.  But I don't think I would have if I hadn't gone looking, determined to find some.  And in the end, the color doesn't diminish my enjoyment of these shows; it heightens it.

In the end, I enjoy these colorized episodes more than watching them in black and white.

If you're a true ""film noir"" afficianado, stick to the original black and white.  They're just as easily obtained, and at the same price.

But if your only objection to colorization is the technology's infamous visual assault, you really ought to consider the color edition of ""Bewitched.""  After all, a lot of people don't like black and white as much as color.  The reason that the first season of ""Bewitched"" was removed from syndication for decades (until being ""rediscovered"" by the folks at Nick at Nite) was that it consistently depressed ratings in syndicated markets, jeoparidizing the financial strength of the entire syndicated package.  (Of course, the popularity of black-and-white ""Bewitched"" on Nick verified the reverse as well: there are folks who like it shown as it was originally created).

A final note: the sitcom's magical Screen Gems cousin, ""I Dream of Jeannie"" has been likewise colorized, with equally good results.  Try the first season of colorized ""Bewitched"" on DVD, and if you like it, get ready for the first season of ""I Dream of Jeannie"" to follow.",1117670400,12,3108,5.049019607843137

In the fall of 1966 is when almost everything on the NBC, CBS and ABC Television Networks were shown in Color.  So, these previous episodes were done in B&W because it was cheaper and the majority of the public still own B&W TV's.

Now, when it comes to ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" the producers and the actor had pointed out that they want the show to remain in B&W.  I don't know about the original ""Twilight Zone"" Series but maybe it and the original ""Outer Limits"" should remain in B&W.  These stories and how they were photograph were meant to be in B&W.

Yet, ""Gilligan's Island"", ""Bewitched"" and several other TV series were only film in B&W because of the mass media.  If they have found a way to colorize these programs then go for it.
