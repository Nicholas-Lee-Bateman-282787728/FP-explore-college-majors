2158887,4,B00062IDLU,I noticed there is a strip across the cover on the copy I got but no big deal. Product was as described. Im just glad to find it at all,1376611200,,135,3.533333333333333
2158888,2,B00062IDLU,"I watched the movie because I am a Ralph Macchio fan as well as a fan of John Lithgow.  The scenery was good, the story line was the same old thing about a vet returning to civilian life.  Nothing new here.",1357344000,,206,4.0
2158889,5,B00062IDLU,A good friend told me that they had seen this movie years ago. I was thrilled watching it---it is a really good action movie.,1353110400,,125,4.25
2158890,5,B00062IDLU,"After viewing ""Distant Thunder"",as a Vietnam Veteran myself,it brought more clarity to my own Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,that I suffer from,& how many people in your life,particularly immediate Family,is affected & even how PTSD can literally can be transferred to your loved ones.
In my opinion,a very well written script,& well acted by all,especially John Lithgow.
Well worth the buying or renting,to learn more about the post-era Vietnam War!",1340323200,,450,5.536231884057971
2158891,5,B00062IDLU,"Another great movie by John Lithgow. He plays the part of the ex Viet Nam Vet very well. Any vet that served in Nam can understand why some broke off from society and went to the state of Washington to hide in the woods,which is true.",1256515200,,234,4.108695652173913
2158892,5,B00062IDLU,"Speaking as a disabled vietnam vet with PTSD, I could identify 100% with Lithgow's character.  A lot of this acting was wooden...but, that's how some of us are...wooden.

I think this movie leaves with more questions asked than answered.  Some of this stuff was typical Hollywood cr*p.  But, enough of it rang close to home.  Not every namvet goes tripwire.  Some integrate totally back into society. Some rejoin partially.  Some not at all.  This injury affects different people different ways.  There is no blanket statement that tell you what it is...and what it is not. Each and every veteran no matter what war is affected by it some way.  Directly or guilt by association, we all get tarred with the same brush.

For my generation of Vets, that war will never be over.  But,I promise you one thing, I will do everything within my power to insure that these kids coming back don't get put through the same mental ringer that the majority of our friends and families put us through we were forced to slink thru McCord.

There's some good acting here.  Too much of it is too close to real for comfort.",1195948800,,1104,4.623711340206185
2158893,3,B00062IDLU,"As a registered nurse on a VA psych unit that has an in-patient PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) unit, I have to say this film does a pretty good job of portraying the extreme end of the spectrum of veterans who returned from Vietnam. Most civilians can't begin to understand how difficult it was for veterans to be trained and then expected to kill without remorse, expected to withstand the trauma of fearing death on a daily basis, and seeing death on a daily basis, especially of friends, of men they knew. Trying to live a normal life when they could not live with the guilt of having taken life, with the guilt of having survived when others they were close to did not, was often impossible for many surviving vets. Add to that the treatment many received when they returned home, being reviled and spat upon, and you have a recipe for alienation and dysfunction. It took almost thirty years for society - and the VA - to realize these men needed the help that PTSD programs (too few) across the country provide.

Lithgow's character attempts to ""come out of the cold"", to reintegrate into society, and finds it more difficult than he can bear. He is unable to deal with his son's need to understand, however, when his buddies in ""the bush"" turn violent in response to an intrusion into their territory, he finds the resources to cope, to do what needs to be done, but then crumbles under his load of guilt. When his son refuses to let him take his own life without his son dying as well, he is forced to make a choice. The film ends with an indication that he has taken a step back into the World, and has made enough of a connection with his son to continue to re-engage. All in all, a pretty fair story.",1148256000,,1717,4.450793650793651
2158894,2,B00062IDLU,John Lithgow gives a good performance in this highly rehashed film.  It is not  new or refreshing.. it is a typical 'nam movie.  If you are a die hard Lithgow fan I would suggest watching some third rock from the sun re runs no one should be subjected to this schlock/,969926400,,268,4.215686274509804
8036903,4,B00062IDLU,"An original story rarely told about returning vets. Overcoming fear of ""normal"" societal interaction, compelled by the love of your son. Two stories with two protagonists, and secondary characters also either overcoming their issues or tragically succumbing to them. Keeps moving at a good pace both lead actors are very good. Moving, suspenseful, dramatic and heartfelt - four solid Stars!",1492041600,,390,5.516666666666667

8036905,5,B00062IDLU,"This film is interesting, with the description of the relationship between a son and a father who are unaware of each other. The film is very credible because the actors are remarkable.",1475452800,,185,4.8125

8036907,4,B00062IDLU,"John Lithgow's characters have a common denominator: the outsider who is so unique in his eccentricity that he either A) falls out of society (this picture) B) conspires against it (Buckaroo Banzai, Blowout), or C) manage to remain hostile and yet keep himself close to those around him ( World According to Garp). This movie demonstrates Lithgow's abilities to pull from A and C. He plays a Vietnam Veteran who has been so damaged by PTSD, that he has been recuperating by living out in the mountains of Washington State (probably near Canadian border, but it's never made clear). This is the kind of film I could see Peter Weir directing, with the mystifying elements of nature inhabiting the soul of the characters; the outsider who is trying to reinstate himself into society but doesn't have the social tools to do so.
This is one of the most heartbreaking performances I have seen in awhile, and definitely Lithgow's best. There is a defeated sadness in his eyes that permeates through everything he says; all he wants to do is connect, not just with his son, who he left when he was only two, but with society as a whole. Ralph Macchio plays his son, and although he does a fine job portraying the muted anguish of an eighteen-year old rediscovering his roots for the first time, I questioned some of his scenes from back home which seem unnecessary. There is a scene where Machio has just graduated high school and given a speech as a valedictorian, and a crush in the front row shows him some leg. What does this mean? We never see her afterwards. These are minor issues in an otherwise superb film, but I kept wondering what significance some of these scenes had in a movie about fragile temperaments. I would highly recommend this film for its seem-less efforts in portraying the long- standing effects of Vietnam, and its permanent stamp on America.",1455148800,,1861,4.711656441717792

8036912,3,B00062IDLU,An honest film about a father trying to reconnect with his son after so many years. John Lithgows character is a Special Forces Vietnam veteran with severe Posttraumatic Stress Disorder living in the Washington State wilderness. He lives with other bush vets with PTSD up in the hills isolated from the world as they live with their own nightmares and intrusive memories. Ralph Macchios character is a high school senior with only vague knowledge of his father by what his mother tells him. A decent movie that could have been stronger but was worth a watch.,1387324800,,558,4.822916666666667
