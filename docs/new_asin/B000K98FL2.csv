However I have a tendency to gravitate toward videos like Rudy Maxxa's and Globe Trekker where there's a mixture of a human in it doing things and talking to the camera and narration. Videos with only narration lose my interest fast (because they're usually done poorly). This one is about as good as narration only videos get. Outside of that fact my only complaint with it the guys voice. If you remember the movie ""The Princes Bride"" he sounds like the little bald guy that keeps saying Inconceivable!.

Had his voice been less irritating I would have given it 4 stars. Had there been a person it the video on occasion I would have given it 5 stars because what was covered was covered well. I have more interest in Beijing now that I did before and the summer palace looks like a nice place to go and rent a boat.

Even with the markdowns listed above I'd still watch this video before many others including Stupendous Shanghai and Bodacious Bejing.",1210636800,,1085,4.50253807106599
