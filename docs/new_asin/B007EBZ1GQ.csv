8515191,4,B007EBZ1GQ,"Wild East Productions latest double feature highlights American actor Guy Madison and his two portrayals of bounty hunter/gunslinger turned to man of the cloth by past demons.  First up is 'REVEREND COLT'- 1970 released at the beginning of the Spaghetti Western's decline and you can see it by the way the film borrows from past oaters.  In a flashback/intro which resembles Director Giulio Petroni's 'DEATH RIDES A HORSE'- 1967, we see Madison as a boy witness the death of his priest father by bandits and how when finally giving them their comeuppance in a shootout, a young boy is tragically killed in the crossfire causing Madison to give up bounty hunting and take up the clerical gauntlet. Still searching for the head of the gang, he enters the town of Tucson to erect a church and teams up with the town sheriff played by another Euro genre stalwart Richard Harrison to eliminate the leader of the gang.  The film is merely routine at best with too much comic relief and a slow pace which is abetted by a catchy score by Gianni Ferrio billed as Lady Park!?.  The titles list Spanish Director Leon Klimovsky as director but the box liner notes and other book sources list Marino Girolami as the helmsman.  After the success of Director Sergio Corbucci's 'DJANGO'-1966, there were many releases carrying the Django name but never suggesting direct sequels or linkage to the character.  Our second feature , Director Osvaldo Civirani's 'SON OF DJANGO' aka 'FIGLIO DI DJANGO' and listed on the DVD BOX as 'VENGEANCE IS A COLT 45'- 1967 has a slight link in that Django is shot in the back by gunmen and witnessed by his offspring (again another reference to 'DEATH RIDES A HORSE') who vows vengeance. Madison may be top billed but the film is owned by Gabriele Tinti, someone who I considered the luckiest man in the world at that time being the husband of Black Emmanuelle herself Laura Gemser. Tinti gives the film an intense edge which is sorely needed and the villainy is supplied by the great Andrew Scott.  Burly Pedro Sanchez who graced many Spaghetti oaters plays a great anti hero role but Madison really has nothing much to do making his first appearance over 40 minutes into the film again as a gunslinger who witnessed Django's demise,turning to the cloth for atonement and thereby aiding the son of Django. Directer Civirani touched many genres but the true surprise is that listed in the credits is eccentric Director Demofilo Fidani aka Miles Deem billed as architect and exteriors who would go on to direct over a dozen westerns both despised or loved by fans. 'VENGEANCE' emerges as the better outing which has one of the best scores by Piero Umiliani and both scripts are scribed by Tito Carpi. Both films are given the excellent Wild East treatment as they are presented in their 1.85 aspect ratios although the colors of 'REVEREND' are truly stunning, picture galleries, alternate opening credits for both films and 6 trailers to other Guy Madison releases.  Although not the quintessential Madison outings, my favorite is his villainous performance in Director Enzo G. Castellari's 'PAYMENT IN BLOOD'-1968 also available from Wild East, this double bill stacks up as an above average package for Spaghetti collectors.  Thanks again, Wild East.",1343606400,7,3269,4.886281588447654
