2100458,1,B0002KPHZ6,"BEWARD, MISLEADING INFO!!!  Wanted a DVD ""Roadshow"" edition of this wonderful movie, with sub-titles, as advertised.  This was just released from KL (late 2017) but when received from Amazon, the sub-titles would not work on my DVD player.  Then tried it in my Blu-Ray player but it was not recognized as Region 1.  This is a cheap, cheap rendering of a great movie.  Returning for refund, very misleading.  Kino Lorber put out a very shoddy product here.  Sad thing, the movie itself deserves five stars.",1513468800,,505,4.870588235294117

2100460,5,B0002KPHZ6,"So glad this is on blu ray! And 3 of some of my favorite actresses and I love the story and Robert Walker (I love Robert Walker, he died to young!) When I first saw his son Robert Walker JR in shows like Star Trek's Charlie X and Other films. I had to do a double take!..but it's like having his dad still around..Also one of the few grow on up film's of Shirley Temple! And who doesn't love Jennifer Jones and Claudette Colbert so great story and great cast!",1512864000,,459,4.111111111111111
2100461,2,B0002KPHZ6,"Since You Went Away is the sort of wartime weepy that deserves far more recognition than it has received in the years since WWII. A great cast and an important story to tell. Kino's Blu-ray is a mess; riddled in artifacts, noise, a barrage of age-related damage. Why this release was not given the necessary clean up it deserves is beyond me. Buy for content. The disc will definitely not win any awards!",1512864000,,404,4.5479452054794525
2100462,5,B0002KPHZ6,"I  absolutely love this film its now my second must watch film about life on the homefront during world war 2. My first is a post-war film call The best years of our lives. A story about 3 ex-servicemen returning home after the war to their regular lives  and having trouble  readjusting . Since you went away is a heartwarming film about family life on the homefront . Its has it  heart wrenching scenes  and lighter  humourous moments . I couldn't  believe the 3 hour running time of this film just flew by. The best years of our lives was roughly the same length.if you are a world war 2 buff like myself or just like classic films you must watch it.

There really was such a time...such people/family/friendships/sacrifice/loss/love.

2100507,5,B0002KPHZ6,"David Selznick owes me a box of tissues. I cried. I laughed. I sighed. This wonderful WWII-era film shows the hardships a family suffered when the breadwinner went to war. The women left behind had a ""roll-up your sleeves and do what you can"" attitude back then, instead of looking to the government with outstretched hands. Strength comes from self-sufficient perseverance, and this film declared that truth beautifully. Although the movie is long (requiring an intermission), I highly recommend it.",1412553600,,500,5.2625

2100512,5,B0002KPHZ6,"""Since You Went Away"" is an excellent treatment of WWII family and soldier adjustments.  Claudette Colbert, Shirley Temple, Jennifer Jones, Joseph Cotten, Monte Wooley, Robert Walker and all members of the cast render stellar performances.",1406764800,,239,5.828571428571428

2100515,5,B0002KPHZ6,"This is what I call ""America's answer to Mrs. Miniver"".  Claudette and her daughters{Jennifer Jones and Shirley Temple} are left to fend for themselves after their husband and father go off to war. They deal with rationing, shortages, death and young love.  Monty Wooley does a great job as an irascible old man who  moves in with them and who is disappointed in his grandson {who just happens to fall in love with Jennifer Jones}.  I don't want to give too much away, but this is a wonderful movie.  Joseph Cotton gives a nice performance as a family friend and Agnes Moorehead  delivers as someone who is determined to have a good time, despite the war and its privations.

You should see this movie!",1401667200,,702,4.612903225806452
2100516,5,B0002KPHZ6,"Delivery was good and your description of the DVD was truthfull and accurate. Thank you for your service. This is a very moving story of how families endured life while their men went off to fight in WWII. Gives you a different perspective of how hard life was for those who lived during WWII.

2100518,5,B0002KPHZ6,"A classic and highly popular film which has not aged with time, and it was made in 1943!  It provides an accurate time capsule of the time in which it was made, and I know, because I was on the planet then and my dad was serving in the U.S. Army.  One facet of the story that is seldom noted is that the family's black housekeeper, maid and surrogate mother to the entire family, has to be let go because the budget can't afford her salary.  She goes to work for a wealthy family in town and makes more money but comes back to the home she lived and worked in so long because she misses the family, she misses her room, and she misses the feeling of being home and belonging.  The answer from Claudette Colbert: Your room was always your room, your room is still your room and if you want to come back come back and I could never take your money.  So she comes back and it is very clear from the film she is not stuck in her beloved room but is a part of family life as she always was.  This is a powerful message but delivered so effectively it is seldom commented on.  Hattie McDaniel is of course pitch perfect in her role, giving it so many nuances we forget we are watching an actor act.",1393891200,,1192,4.090128755364807
2100519,1,B0002KPHZ6,"I was sold a DVD that was defective....stopped playing about 15 minutes into the movie and the portion that did play had terrible sound quality with Korean sub titiles that could not be removed. It seemed like a ""home-made"" copy where the sound had been dubbed in. Terrible and a complete waste of money. Shame on Amazon for selling this product from their site.",1392681600,,362,4.671875
2100520,5,B0002KPHZ6,"Although I have been a classic film fan since I was a child, I did not see this film until about five years ago.  It is wonderful.  Every character is beautifully cast.  I keep my copy in my row of ""Christmas"" movies, but it is a film to watch all year around.  I especially applaud the performance of Agnes Moorehead as the sarcastic ""holier than thou"" Emily Hawkins.  Joseph Cotten is his usual outstanding self.  Robert Walker (Sr.) is so convincing as the young soldier looking for approval from his grandfather, you want to reach out into the screen and give him a hug (well, that's the mother in me).  Claudette Colbert and Jennifer Jones are a great mother-daughter team and the main reasons I watch this film with a Kleenex box nearby. Hattie McDaniel is the faithful Fidelia, and McDaniel shows her acting cops, especially in her scenes with Joseph Cotten  Monty Woolley as Colonel Smollett is a role that Woolley does best: the blustering grumpy man with a warm, caring heart he keeps hidden. Shirley Temple and the dog Soda are a bit of comic relief, but Temple plays her part of the younger teenaged daughter very well and with minimal ""cuteness"".  The story is finely told during World War II and tells of the hardships on the home front for those who must wait and pray and work and hold things together.  It is a lovely movie.",1391904000,,1341,4.55
2100521,5,B0002KPHZ6,"Well, I just love this movie, that's all.  WWII era family film suitable for all.

2100522,4,B0002KPHZ6,"Wonderful cast, giving excellent (if dated, of course) performances, as anticipated. Watched this with my mom, who was a young woman during WWll; she very much enjoyed it and, I along with her, as it was lore from my parents' pasts. We had some good conversations as she recounted *boys* whom she knew, who *didn't come home*, as well as other short tales of those times of war, concern, loss...from a stateside American perspective. Fine-enough period piece, *predictable*, but excellently crafted by MGM in its prime and, a good DVD format that, mechanically, worked flawlessly.",1390521600,,580,5.11578947368421
2100523,4,B0002KPHZ6,"I owned a VHS copy, but needed to also buy the DVD. The film is a sentimental favorite, with good acting. My particular interest was of a short scene where a small Hummel-like figurine is featured, because it was made by my grandfather, Josef Joseph. He came from Vienna in 1939 and was commissioned to make this piece for the film.",1389484800,,332,4.459016393442623

We lived with my grand-parents, (the parents of the three uncles) I know how concerned they all were about my uncles espacially after the Normandy invasion. It was easy for me to relate to the women in this film. It's a good look at the lives of those who stayed at home and worried about the ones who went to war.",1362873600,,463,3.989247311827957

2100545,5,B0002KPHZ6,"While long, this is a great glimpse of life on the homefront during WWII. It's interesting to watch the characters grow from the safe, sheltered, upper middle class existence of their pre-war American lives into women who are suddenly forced to function on their own while America is at war. The cast is wonderful, with Claudette Colbert leading the way as mother to Jennifer Jones and a teenaged Shirley Temple. Wonderful supporting characters of Monty Wooley, Joseph Cotten, Hattie MacDaniel and Agnes Moorhead round out this wonderful film. While not a Christmas movie, persay, I always watch it at Christmastime and say a prayer for all the men and women serving in the military. A definite must for anyone with an interest in the WWII era.",1357516800,,744,4.912698412698413

2100547,5,B0002KPHZ6,"If you must have a plot in your movie, then this one will be a change of pace for you - it's all about relationships, & it's exceptionally well done. From beginning to end, it's 100% about people interacting with one another during war time (WW2). I was 6 years old when Pearl Harbor was bombed, grew up in the Los Angele, CA area & though this film came out when I was 9 ('44), I didn't see it till I was 77 (2012). At times the tears streamed down my face as I was viewing this film, though I wasn't really crying. The memories crowded in of that time in my life. I have crossed paths with quite a number of movie stars in my life, & I remember almost literally bumping into Shirley Temple one morning as I descended some stairs of a motel in Carmel Highlands, CA back in the late '80s. The very famous, easily recognizable smile she flashed at me as her face turned towards me blew me completely away & I was unable to greet her as I would have liked to. Onr of those situations you kick yourself about later.

This movie was deliberately made to emphasize the importance of how people need to give encouragement & support to one another - especially in times of crises. I appreciate movies that emphasize that as this one did, & actors who act it out, writers who write about it, & those others who are also involved. Most of those involved in the making of this film are now dead. Shirley Temple is still alive. Kudos to you, Shirley - & to the others who in films like this help us to realize who we should be as human being made in God's image, & how we should act towards one another.",1351468800,,1592,4.185667752442996

Shirley Temple deserved better.  Why did I watch it from beginning to end?  Because I hoped that Shirley Temple would eventually get what she deserved, a chance to be an adult actress.  Never happened.  Also, the rest of the cast is so outstanding, I simply got curious.  How could this film be so mediocre?

2100550,5,B0002KPHZ6,"I wasn't around when this movie was released, but suspect that 3 hour mega movie was probably viewed as a love letter to the stoic folks at home during WWII. It's premise is so simple that it can be described as the trials and tribulations of the families left behind when the men went off to war in uncertain times and how people adapted to the changing scene at home that seemed to be in constant flux.
The story centers around the Hilton family. The father goes off to war while the mother Anne (Claudette Colbert) and her daughters Jane(Jennifer Jones) and Bridget (a teenaged Shirley Temple) deal with the loss of the husband and all the social and economic changes that are brought about by the war. The family regroups on a lot of levels and evolves as they face their own homefront challenges. As the story progresses, the viewer sees an already pretty nice family doing what they can to support the war effort and as a result becoming even better people.
While melodramatic and sentimental, it manages to do a lot to convey the feelings of many americans regarding WWII. I fell into the premise of this movie easily because my grandparents talked a lot about the changes they experienced and society as a whole experienced. The cast was really good and very convincing. I particularly liked Joseph Cotten,Robert Walker, Colbert, and Jones in their lead roles while the supporting actors such as Fanny McDaniels, Agnes Moorehead, Nazimova, Keenan Wynn, and Monty Wooley rounded out the casting in their support.
This was a movie that echoed the era and came across as a cross between pictures by Norman Rockwell and Currier and Ives.",1314489600,,1641,4.741258741258742
2100551,5,B0002KPHZ6,"This is one of my favorite movies.  It is long, but yet when watching it, it doesn't feel like it.  The way Ann and her daughters feel about the husband and father.  It must be like heaven on earth, to be loved so much.  One of the scenes that I like so much, is when Joseph Cotton (Uncle Tony) shows them the poster he made an encruting poster for the Waves!  It's Ann and he has her showing a lot of leg.  And though of course he really isn't, says he was surprised they turned it down and then they shipped him out. As for Monty Wooley he as always is great.  Jane and Bridget become like granddaughter to him, and Ann no doubt like a daughter. When she gets that telegram informing that her husband Tim is missing in action, well it really gets to one's heart.  The aftermath, showing their reaction to the news, well just reread the sentence about being loved so much.  What a jem of a husband and father he must be.  Also I like the way Hattie McDonnel as the maid(too bad that prejudice at the time prevented her from having the career she deserved) is treated by the family.  They don't talk down to her, and she is treated with true love yet that and respect.  At Jane's graduration, she is invited and sits with the family. Even if Tim was there, she would still be invited and still be sitting with the family.  The only reason not after all, is that they are allowed only so many tickets for the students to give for family and friends to attend.  And when Ann finds out that the young boy Jonney is killed very soon after talking to them, you feel such sadness too.  And at the end when after she opens the gift that Tim had brought for her, well a person would have to have a heart of stone, not to be moved just a little.  She receivies a phone call informing her that Tim is alive and well.  A person who doesn't have a heart of stone, can't help but be moved.  I recommend this movie to others.

2100555,4,B0002KPHZ6,"WWII was still raging, and producer David O. Selznick wanted to make a film, not about the fighting, but about the American home front. Margaret Buell Wilder had published a collection of her letters to her soldier husband, and Selznick took it upon himself to adapt it into a screen play for one of his trademark ""blockbusters.""  Since You Went Away never reached the heights of Selznick's Gone With the Wind, but with an all star cast, great direction (John Cromwell), and top notch cinematography (Stanley Cortez and Lee Garmes), it captured the attention of a populace coping with the deprivations of wartime.  Claudette Colbert played housewife Ann Hilton, who struggles to maintain a normal home environment for her daughters Jane (Jennifer Jones) and Bridget (Shirley Temple). This family is financially secure, but must still deal with shortages, rationing, separations, returning wounded, and constant anxiety and worry. Ann is supported by her housekeeper, Fidelia (Hattie McDaniel, Mammy in GWTW), and family friend Lt. Tony Willett (Joseph Cotten) who loves Ann, but chastely.  There's an awful lot of gee whiz sincerity in this story, which is relieved now and then by Agnes Morehead as a catty society matron. Morehead wen[...]t on to play many crone types, but as seen here, she was quite a lovely woman. Guess that's why they call it acting.

Since You Went Away contains many dated elements (the musical score, which won an Oscar, is positively saccharine, as is some of the dialogue), but nevertheless it works. The granddaddy of all subsequent train station parting scenes is touchingly enacted by Jennifer Jones and her fiance (Robert Walker), who is shipping out to the European front. In a bit of interesting trivia, Jones and Walker were married in real life and were in the midst of a tense separation. The portrayal of the big dance, set in a hangar, is delightful, and the final scenes on Christmas Eve are sure to bring tears to the eyes of anyone with a heart. Considering who the producer was, the length of this movie, close to three hours, should come as no surprise, and some of the scenes truly are overlong. This film has been criticized as propogandist, but watch it for its fine performances and a picture of American idealism.",1295740800,,2263,4.947368421052632

From the moment Claudette Colbert comes home after seeing her husband off for war, the tears start and the women's soap opera begins. It goes on and on, too, because this film is almost three hours long. That is a lot of time for a lot of heartaches. How many hankies is that? It has to be the whole Kleenex box!

I'm not making fun of it. The topic - women seeing their men off to war and never knowing if they'll come back alive - has been a tragic one since mankind began.

The cast in here was astonishing with people such as Jennifer Jones, Joseph Cotten, Guy Madison, Shirley Temple, Monty Whooley, Hattie McDaniel, Agnes Moorhead, Craig Stevens, Keenan Wynn, Robert Walker and Lionel Barrymore.

I found no fault with any of them expect perhaps Temple, whose young-adult roles never matched her little girl performances, except for ""The Bachelor and The Bobbysoxer.""

It was interesting to see a young Stevens, who 15 years later starred in television's ""Peter Gunn"" series. It also was a bit odd seeing Jones and Walker together because they got divorced in 1944, the same year this movie was released. This must have been awkward for them to film since they obviously were not doing well in their real-life marriage.

This movie isn't all tears. There are some genuinely warm moments in here, including a very nice Christmas scene. People generations ago were more hopeful and optimistic, too. Today's world is much more cynical, so this film makes some critics unhappy because they think the people are too goody-goody. Well, too bad for them. For me, that's part of the charm of classic era movies: nicer attitudes.

We should never forget that or be insensitive to it and for me; someone who has never been to war or suffered the loss of someone who has, this film serves as a good reminder.

And the black-face lines they feed to Hattie McDaniel are embarrassing, though she manages to make her character into more than the script would seem to allow.

But somehow it all holds together, taking us through a year in the life of an American family while Dad's away at war. The undertone of sacrifice and perseverance during hard times is compelling. And, by 1944, Hollywood had created such a rich mythology around the war that a movie only needed to make quiet references to people's fears and hopes in order to pull you in. It still works today.

Look at the dance sequence in the airplane hangar or the departing train scene for clear evidence of their artistry. Otherwise, the film directed by John Cromwell is emblematic of its time as a morale booster to war-weary audiences looking for ways to cope with the eternal wait for the serving men. Based on a novel by Margaret Buell Wilder written in the form of a series of letters, Selznick took it upon himself to flesh out the story into a full-fledged screenplay with the intent of making an American version of the 1942 MGM classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mrs-Miniver/dp/B00011D1OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mrs. Miniver</a>&nbsp;complete with an overly effusive musical score by Max Steiner.

The simple story focuses on the Hilton family. Head of the household Tim (who is only seen in the movie in photos) has just left, and his wife Anne is trying to cope with the initial loneliness. Oldest daughter Jane is a boy-crazy high school senior, and fifteen-year-old Brig is the perky rabble-rouser-wannabe. Devoted to Tim with unconditional devotion, the three have an ideal relationship. Because they have to now survive only on his allotment checks, Anne has to let family maid Fidelia go, even though she comes back to work for them for free. Such situations obviously just happen in the movies. They take in a boarder, the easily irritable Colonel Smollett, and things get complicated when family friend Lt. Tony Willett shows up. Jane develops a crush on Tony, but her affections quickly transfer to Smollett's grandson Billy, a puppyish enlistee who is summarily ignored by his grandfather for getting ejected from West Point. The film starts to move into a quagmire of tear-jerking scenes at this point, and the last part introduces new situations and characters  much too quickly - including a potentially interesting episode on Anne's job in a steel mill - before the film finally ends.

Colbert is wonderful as the patient Anne from start to finish. As Jane, Jennifer Jones tries too hard to be youthful at the beginning (she was 25) but settles down when her character falls in love with Billy and matures due to an unexpected tragedy. In a role virtually identical to the one he played in Vincente Minnelli's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Clock/dp/B000JU8H8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Clock</a>&nbsp;opposite Judy Garland, Robert Walker overdoes Billy's callowness to an off-putting degree. Regardless, I have to admit his scenes with Jones are touching, especially the famous goodbye scene at the train platform (satirized hilariously in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airplane/dp/B000B5XOWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airplane!</a>). Appearing about four years after the last of her child roles, Shirley Temple transitions nicely into adolescence as the spirited Brig. As the dashing Tony, Joseph Cotten is not particularly challenged here since he seems to be replaying Uncle Charlie from Alfred Hitchcock's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow-of-a-Doubt/dp/B000CCW2SY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadow of a Doubt</a>&nbsp;with none of the darkness. The same can be said about Monty Woolley as Smollett, Hattie McDaniel as the comically inappropriate Fidelia (whose musical accompaniment sounds patronizingly like a cotton plantation spiritual), and even Agnes Moorehead playing Anne's narrow-minded society friend.

I understand that Claudette Colbert at first objected to playing a woman with two teenage daughters; the script manages to work in that her soldier husband is only about 40 (though he looks older than that in his photo) so I guess we're meant to think that Claudette was a child bride.  The adults in this film played almost-believable real grownups, given the film conventions of its time.  Joseph Cotten is a handsome rake on the make, Claudette does let the pressures get to her frome time to time, Agnes Moorehead plays a bitchy divorcee (was there any other kind?)  Hattie McDaniel was unfortunately relegated  again to a stereotypical black housekeeper who mangles the English language to everyone's amusement, but she as always also projects wisdom and humanity despite her sometimes silly dialogue.  Monty Wooley plays the martinet colonel with the heart of gold, but he doesn't melt too much so as to become sappy.
Jennifer Jones was a overage to play a high school senior, but she really did a lovely job with this, portraying both young first love, and
maturing victim of war's tragedy.  This film is 3 hours long, and Selznick made it into an ""epic"" with an overture and entre'acte (presumably so film goers could go to the bathroom).  There is a lot of sentimentality here, and these characters aren't just individuals, but supposed to represent all the roles that people play in war (I mean really, can you imagine Claudette Colbert working as a riveter in a shipyard), but like ""Mrs Miniver"", you love these people in spite of the melodrama.

Since this was made 'during' WWII, one has to understand & be able to place oneself back into the 1940s during that terrible war - thoughts, attitudes, fears, etc. were special to that period; if one is unable to assume that transfer back to that period, then the film will not appeal - personally, I side w/ most of the other reviewers here!",1199664000,,689,4.468253968253968

2100581,5,B0002KPHZ6,"Eight of the most famous stars of the day, a warm and tender story, and an uplifting message make this 1944 film a true classic.  David O. Selznick, still riding a crest of popularity after his stunning ""Gone With The Wind,"" borrowed several ideas from that masterpiece.  A long and stirring overture, an intermission in this lengthy three-hour show, and the introduction of a stunning beauty (Jennifer Jones, whom he would later marry) would copy but never equal his previous success, yet this is a magnificent film in its own right as it tells an inspiring story of patriotism, loss, and true love.

Claudette Colbert is Anne Hilton.  In the opening scene, she has just taken husband Tim to the train station where he has left to fight in World War II.  Her daughters are Jane (Jennifer Jones) and Bridget (Shirley Temple) and along with their live-in maid and dear friend Fidelia (Hattie McDaniel) they give an impressive view of how the women left behind survived not only the loneliness but also the rationing and social pressures of WWII.

Monty Woolley is Col Smollett, the curmudgeon of a boarder they are forced to take in to make ends meet, and Robert Walker, Jr. is Bill, his estranged grandson who falls in love with Jane.  (Interesting trivia:  Walker and Jones were married in real life but in the process of divorcing during this movie since she and Selznick were in love and would later marry.)  Joseph Cotten is Lt. Tony Willett who has a deep affection for Anne and Agnes Moorehead is her embittered friend Emily Hawkins.  Look for Lionel Barrymore as the clergyman and Guy Madison (who would later achieve fame as TV's Wild Bill Hickok) as the lonely sailor in bit parts.

Anne must keep her family together and never let their spirits sag as they acutely feel the absence of Tim.  Daughter Jane will survive a great tragedy and their ornery boarder will have his own epiphany.  Keep your hankies handy as you wonder along with the characters if life will ever be the same.

Nominated for nine Academy awards (best picture, best actress, best supporting actress, best supporting actor, cinematography, art direction, editing, music score, and special effects)  this is one classic movie lovers will not want to miss.",1196467200,,2235,4.81413612565445
2100582,5,B0002KPHZ6,"This is the first film I've ever seen that begins with a 10 minute `Overture'; the music is excellent and won the composer, Max Steiner, the 1945 Oscar for Best Music. The film was nominated for 9 Oscars, directed by John Cromwell, (The Enchanted Cottage) and written & produced by the man himself, David O. Selznick. Selznick evidently intended this film to reach the box office and epic movie success of `Gone with the Wind', however popular at the time and now considered one of the top twenty 40's films ever made, never reached Selznick's expectations.

The film follows the lives of the Hunter family after Mr. Hunter leaves to go and fight in the war. Claudette Colbert in the role of Mrs. Hunter carries the film throughout the three hours but is well supported by the Hunter girls', Jane (The beautiful Jennifer Jones) and Brig (An older Shirley Temple) including a close friend of the family, Anthony Willett (Joseph Cotton).

What makes this film unique for its time is its perspective of the wives and children left behind as husbands, fathers and sons went to war.

The DVD not only includes an `Overture"" but an actual Intermission, where the beautiful soundtrack continues to play in the background.

The clergyman played by the regal Lionel Barrymore gives a sermon in a moving monologue representing America's Ideals of preserving liberty. Barrymore is a legend and this short speech in the film affirms this legendary status.

Personally, my favourite character is the irascible Colonel Smollet (Monty Woolly) as his character is the type one never sees anymore, old-worldly, traditional, strong, and a man of principles.

For some of us living in the 21st century this film may appear too sentimental and possibly `corny', but it represents America's high values: the importance of family and strength of character during war time. Values that continue to be important today as our boy's continue to leave their homes and families to fight (in most cases) senseless wars.

We forget that those left behind, particularly the women, fought hard to even survive and supported their respective families and the war effort in ways that should be acknowledged more than it currently is or in the past.

I like this film because the themes and values it represents are very important and should never be forgotten.

Jennifer Jones (who filed divorce papers from then husband Robert Walker the day after their final scene was filmed) showed the depth of her craft.  Even though they were going their separate ways both played like two young people falling in love.

Agnes Moorehead is perfect as the stuck up woman who feels that hosting tea dances is all she needs to do to support the troops and can't understand why a young lady such as Jones would want to volunteer in a VA hospital.  Hattie McDaniel gives her usual stellar performance although in a minimal role.  Monty Woolery is typecast to be a cranky old man but softens when he spends time with the Hilton family and realizes that perhaps he was too harsh with  his now dead grandson (Walker).  Jospeh Cotten is the typical Naval Officer playboy who seems to have a number of girls in port.

While the movie is long it is worth watching.  It should serve as a reminder of the sacrifices made by every family who sends a loved one off to war--no matter what war it is.",1141430400,,1454,4.328413284132841
2100588,3,B0002KPHZ6,"Since You Went Away is the epitome of a family war film. It is so standard, that one will be able to guess what happens next throughout the film. Although it is certainly filled with heartwarming moments, most of them seem artificial and therefore less emotional.

The film has an amazing cast, headed by the beautiful Claudette Colbert. She is perhaps the best in the film but also very standard. She makes her character believable, but unfortunately is boring.

The lighting is really great; the cameraman and the director seemed to have a great grasp on the use of light and shadow. However, beautiful photography does not save a film.

It is obvious that Selznik's company meant for this to be an important film. There is an overture and an intermission just the way there is in Gone With the Wind, but the difference is that Gone With the Wind is an amazing film and this one comes off as being just okay.",1140307200,,910,4.570552147239264
2100589,4,B0002KPHZ6,"SINCE YOU WENT AWAY (1944) is a beautiful wartime drama about the women left behind, and their contributions to the war effort.  Based on Margaret Buell Wilder's acclaimed novel with a screenplay by David O. Selznick, SINCE YOU WENT AWAY provided Claudette Colbert with her finest performance of the decade, as Anne Hilton, whose husband is away at war but finds excitement and drama thanks to her two adolescent daughters. Jennifer Jones glows as the eldest daughter Jane, with Shirley Temple as the tomboyish Bridget (""Brig"").

The film garnered nine Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture, and acting nods to Colbert, Jones and Monty Woolley), but only managed to win `Best Music Scoring' for Max Steiner's stirring compositions.

The photography is amazing, whilst remaining within the confines of the simple domesticity the film depicts; but neverthless beautifully cinematic when the occasion calls for it.  The Army Ball, set in an airplane hanger, is perhaps one of the most brilliant sequences ever captured in a film, with Agnes Moorehead leading a conga-line which seems to stretch on forever; and arc-lights illuminating  couples dancing the waltz.

Robert Walker plays Jane's (Jennifer Jones) ill-fated sweetheart William Smollett.  In reality, Walker and Jones were married at the time, but Jones ended up divorcing Walker to marry David O. Selznick (her mentor and the man largely responsible for her career) in 1949.  Tragically, Robert Walker died two years later.

The strong ensemble cast also includes Hattie McDaniel, Joseph Cotten and Lionel Barrymore.  Selznick managed to coax legendary silent star Alla Nazimova out of retirement for a small but very important role.  This was the Selznick's answer to the successful M-G-M production ""Mrs Miniver"", released two years earlier.  Both films make great companion pieces.

The DVD presents the film complete and uncut and (for the first time) with Overture and Intermission/Entr'acte sequences.",1136764800,,1976,5.4183006535947715

2100591,3,B0002KPHZ6,"A woman and her two daughters try to cope after her husband goes off to war in 1944's SINCE YOU WENT AWAY, a four-hankie weepie made during World War II.  Boasting an all-star cast, Gone With the Wind's producer David O. Selznick, and epic length (nearly 3-hours, with intermission), this movie should be a revered classic.  However, like Gone With the Wind, it hasn't aged all that well.

  You can't, for the most part, fault the cast.  The redoubtable Claudette Colbert could play `ideal woman' with the best of them, and here her ability to portray quiet yearning for her departed husband is one of the movie's biggest assets.  The `ideal' theme is punctuated by Joseph Cotten, here an artist turned navy commander who loves old flame Anne Hilton from a flirtatious yet unbridgeable distance.  Agnes Moorehead as the somewhat shrill `bad' statesider is also effective.  Love to see those that sneer at rationing get their comeuppance, even if I have to wait nearly three hours for it. The revelation, though, is Robert Walker as the ""Golly gee"" youth who finds love with one of Colbert's daughters, played by Walker's then real-life wife Jennifer Jones, shortly before his unit is due to ship out.  The only other movie I've seen Walker in was Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, in which he plays probably the best film psychopath ever.  His role in this movie is as far away from Bruno Anthony as can be imagined, and it's terribly affecting.

  Monty Woolley, who made something of a career out of playing curmudgeons coming to dinner and nesting in a spare room, here plays a curmudgeonly retired colonel who rents a room from cash-strapped Colbert.  That he's the estranged grandfather of sweet young Robert Walker is a happy coincidence.  Shirley Temple, Colbert's other daughter, made something of a career out of charming old curmudgeons and crying on cue, both of which traits are severely tested by this movie.  It was effective when she was six, but at sixteen I found it, well, annoying.  In fact, both the Woolley and the Temple characters seemed a little convenient, a little phony.  Temple because she couldn't act, Woolley because he was too much Sheridan Whiteside from The Man Who Came to Dinner.  If they merely annoyed, Hattie McDaniel's `Fidelia' shocked and offended.  Fidelia was the Hilton's maid until Tim Hilton enlistment, at which point she was let go because the family could no longer afford her.  The movie has her returning to the Hiltons, as their maid, for no money because... well, because she loves the family so much and she can't stand to see them try to survive without her.  So, after her day job she will come `home' and play maid for the Hiltons.

 Look, I realize SINCE YOU WENT AWAY is supposed to be a sentimental celebration of the loved ones on the home front.  Much of it is moving and touching, especially the parts played by Cotten and Walker.

2100595,4,B0002KPHZ6,"I saw this movie for the first time the other night.  Frankly, I had not heard of it before and that surprized me because it is a good movie and, I believe, an important one.  It gives a wide view of life on the home front during WWII. We see it through the eyes of a middle to upper-middle class household of a middle-aged woman and her two teen-age daughters.  The husband/father enlisted, patriotically, and the family then has to face life without the patriarch for an indefinite period of time.  We see the small crises and the big ones; some bigger than we wanted to see.  We also see how different people handle the stress and challenges of the war on the homefront.

The acting is very good with a lot of well-known names; Monty Woolley, Claudet Colbert, Jennifer Jones, Shirley Temple, Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Lionel Barrymore, Robert Walker, and Hattie McDaniel.  There are also a few up and comers that you may or may not recognize.  Claudet Colbert is the unquestionable star of the movie but my choice as the next best is Monty Woolley who is his usual aloof self but with a heart that makes a few cameo appearances.  The one character who I found out of place is the the role played by Joseph Cotton.  The role was too loosely defined and he seemed to interrupt rather than enhance the flow of the movie.  My other negative comment is that the movie was about 30 minutes too long.  There was plenty of room for a better film editing job.  This is not the quality of ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" but, for those of us who came after WWII, it IS a very good look at life at home during the war.",1110499200,,1614,4.357859531772576
2100596,5,B0002KPHZ6,"I saw this film at the Castro Theater here in San Francisco during a two week Selznick Festival during which Ronald Haver spoke before every film.

Haver said that Selznick had to pay Colbert triple her usual salary because it was the first time she'd be playing the mother part, and she argued that after you play a mother once, Hollywood will never again cast you in the femme fatale part.  She was right!  Her career never again reached the heights it had once hit regularly.

No matter, she gave a great performance and showed what an ordinary American woman can do in time of war.  The ironic thing is that Colbert was French herself, which makes her conversation with Alla Nazimova towards the end of the movie even more bizarre (the one about ""You are America to me, Mrs. Hilton."")

The movie itself is super-long and sometimes contrived but for the most part it is one of the greatest spectacles of US cinema.  Just the lighting in the big canteen dance is enough to make your eyes bug out of your head.  The hundreds of extras doing the jitterbug--and then hearing the sound of the planes propelling the boys away to an uncertain destination.  And of course the sequence where Jane and Bill have to part and she goes running after his train, crying and trying not to hit any pillars, is a famous tearjerker.  And how sexy is the day when Jane and Bill go out to the country and get caught in the rain and the barn and the straw--it's better than THE OUTLAW!

Because the movie employed so many gay stars (not Jennifer Jones or Shirley Temple) it has a strange kind of artificial glamor to it that gives you pause, as do so many of the films of John Cromwell.  Agnes Moorehead is completely free of vanity in this movie, she says and does things that any other actress would have balked at.  Haver said that people threw things at her on the street after this film came out, she gave such an unsparing portrait of a selfish hoarder and sex maniac.

Guy Madison looks fantastic and he's really a golden boy in this movie, making Robert Walker look absolutely po-faced in comparison.  Seems like I saw Rhonda Fleming, too, at the dance sequence--could she really be in this film?  I don't know if she was contracted to Selznick or not.

Did you know that, in typical DOS fashion, producer Selznick pressured each one of his leads to sign some version of this statement (and used them in publicity)-- ""'Since You Went Away' is the finest picture in which I've ever appeared'""?  Jennifer Jones, Shirley Temple, Monty Woolley, Joseph Cotten, Robert Walker and Claudette Colbert all complied, reluctantly or not.",1109030400,,2614,4.58494623655914
2100597,4,B0002KPHZ6,"The lead Amazon reviews of this film give thorough descriptions of the plot and characters; and as I substantially agree with their views of the film, I will limit myself to my primary impressions. The black and white cinematography and camera work, noted by others, are indeed superb. The extended sequence of the USO dance is breathtaking in its dramatic flow and alternation of intimacy with stylized, dramatically distanced views of the dancers' movements on the floor of the cavernous armory. And it is refreshing to see a portrayal of a FUNCTIONAL family--something that the entertainment industry seems to have little interest in these days. Also notable is the film's considerable score; not a moment passes without appropriate orchestral accompaniment. That said, the film is too long--nearly three hours. But Selznick, Director John Cromwell, and a superb cast have bequeathed to us a look into what seems to be another world, where characters' flaws are recognized but where decency, honest emotion, and a sense of duty leavened with modesty and humor prevail, presented with nothing less than professionalism and frequently with considerable art. Wonderful that it is available on DVD! A personal note: When this film was released in 1944, I was two years old, living in Wollaston, Massachusetts with my grandparents, mother, and aunt, awaiting the return of my father (whom I met for the first time in 1946 at age four) from the South Pacific. I lived in the world shown in this film, although I was too young at the time to have much of an understanding of what was at stake.",1105747200,,1589,5.0

""Mrs. Miniver"" is probably the best homefront movie made from the viewpoint of the UK but ""Since You Went Away"" is the best from the US perspective.  This movie is purely beautiful.  Claudette Colbert is perfect as the stalwart wife and mother.  Tim, the unseen member of the cast, is made to live for the viewer simply by the loving comments and reminisces of the members of his family.  Shirley Temple proved that she can act, thank you very much, as a grown-up young lady who was required neither to sing nor dance. She was simply wonderful. Jennifer Jones was her regal, tragic self and both Joseph Cotton and Monty Woolley played their parts to perfection.

2100601,4,B0002KPHZ6,"During the World War II years, films about the soldiers who fought the war were proliferate but there were not that many  about the families left behind at home. The British had scored a big hit in 1942 with ""Mrs. Miniver"" which won numerous Academy Awards. Producer David Selznick wanted to make a film that depicted an American family and their struggles during this difficult time. ""Since You Went Away"" was the result. It deals with a Midwestern mother and her two teenage daughters and how their lives are affected when the husband and father is sent to war.

Claudette Colbert plays the mother (she first balked at playing a mother to two teenagers) and she is very good if a tad refined for a housewife. Jennifer Jones and Shirley Temple play the daughters and rounding out the all star cast is Joseph Cotten, Monty Woolley, Robert Walker, Agnes Moorehead, Hattie McDaniel, Nazimova, Lionel Barrymore and Guy Madison. And if you look quick, you will see Dorothy Dandridge in the dance scene.

As with most David O. Selznick features, the film is padded perhaps too much (it runs for almost 3 hours) and is heavy on the sentiment. However, the film is very entertaining and there are numerous memorable scenes. The most famous is a touching farewell sequence at a train station as Jane (Jennifer Jones) says goodbye to her boyfriend (Robert Walker). What is ironic about that scene is that in real life, Jones and Walker were married but were in the midst of a separation. A definate tear-jerking moment as is the last scene with Colbert sitting at the Christmas tree alone on Christmas eve.

The film looks fantastic on this new MGM dvd release. There are no special features which is really a shame. For the price though, this is an excellent buy for your home film library.",1098316800,,1782,4.720257234726688
2100602,4,B0002KPHZ6,"""Since You Went Away"" is David O. Selznick feeble attempt to turn a simple war time melodrama in a contemporary ""Gone With The Wind."" Running just under three-hours - and with enough tear-jerking moments to stock up three films, this cry-fest extraordinaire was meant to be a sincere tribute to all the families who stayed behind while their men went off to fight in World War II. Claudette Colbert stars as Mrs. Anne Hilton, the dutiful wife and mother of two evangelic daughters, Deborah (surprise, surprise - Jennifer Jones) and Briget (Shirley Temple - all grown up and not nearly as effective as during her childhood tenure at Fox). Selznick's screenplay concocts Anne as the veritable to0-good-to-be-true model of courage and strength on the home front. However, after the first hour or so, charting the family's day-to-day life and struggles get to wear a bit thin on the mind and heart.

In retrospect the doomed romance between Deborah and departing serviceman, William Smollett (Robert Walker) seems foreshadowing to the end of Walker and Jones marriage in real life. Guy Madison - a Selznick `discovery' whom the producer hoped would pay off in the same way as his earlier finds, failed to catch on, though in this film he is particularly used to good effect as the all American fighting boy in blue. Despite its shortcomings, ""Since You Went Away"" was a resounding box office success when it was released and was nominated for a truck-load of Oscars. But the tide of favorable preference in Academy voters had begun to turn against Selznick films by this time. ""Since You Went Away"" took only one statuette home for its moody and evocative black-and-white cinematography.

MGM's DVD is rather impressive. The B&W picture exhibits a very nicely balanced gray scale with smooth, solid blacks and very clean whites. Age related artifacts are present throughout but do not distract. Some minor edge enhancement crops up but pixelization is kept to a minimum. Overall the picture will surely not disappoint. The audio is mono but more than adequate for a film of this vintage. There are no extras.",1097798400,,2104,4.957507082152975
2100603,5,B0002KPHZ6,"""Since You Went Away"" was released in 1944 and shows a different side of war - families coping with life stateside. The peerless Claudette Colbert stars as Anne Hilton, and the picture picks up with her entering her empty home after her husband has been deployed.  She struggles to put on a happy face for her teen daughters, played by Jennifer Jones and Shirley Temple.  All three of them make sacrifices and experience tragedies as they bravely endure war which impinges on their previously ideal middle-class life.  Into their lives come an abrasive, retired Colonel (Monty Woolley), the Colonel's timid son (Robert Walker, who was married to Jennifer Jones at the time), and a charming family friend who is stationed nearby (Joseph Cotton).

Producer David O. Selznick wanted the movie to be as superior as his earlier ""Gone with the Wind.""  That comparison is a bit lofty, but ""Since You Went Away"" is extremely good - a top-notch Hollywood film in every way.  The casting and acting are superlative, particularly Colbert; Temple is also quite good in one of her few young adult roles.  The direction by John Cromwell (father of actor James) is stunning, with a multitude of intimate scenes interspersed with some incredible set-pieces, such as the USO cantina dance.  Perhaps the most famous scene takes place in a train station, with Jennifer Jones tearfully biding goodbye to her boyfriend as she runs alongside his train.  The scene was even parodied in ""Airplane!""

Although the film teeters toward melodrama at times and the movie is undeniably glossy, but the script is so pitch-perfect and warm that it manages to be tremendously effective.  The film may sound like an American retread of 1942's ""Mrs. Miniver,"" but the plot is quite different and even funny at times.  The film received a number of Oscar nominations: Picture, Actress (Colbert), Supporting Actor (Woolley), Supporting Actress (Jones); it won for best score.  ""Since You Went Away"" is one of the finest war movies of the 1940s; however, perhaps because of its rather genteel tone, it's been somewhat forgotten, which is really a shame.

2100605,4,B0002KPHZ6,"I saw this yesterday on TCM. Yes it is sentimental and patriotic and a bit syrupy in the dialog. But it was released in 1944- meaning it was filmed right in the middle of World War II, so the sentiment and especially the times are aptly reflected. More than anything else, the film's virtues are from the performances. Claudette Colbert reminds me very much of Norma Shearer's matriarch in 'The Women:' warm, intelligent, and very likable, but surrounded by the constrictions and circumstances of the time. (It's interesting to hear her tell Joseph Cotten two hours into the film that she feels useless and is not contributing to the war effort when in fact she's been contributing all along.) Cotten is wonderful as her surrogate mate (still carrying a torch after all these years) and daughters Temple and the beautiful Jones are quite good. There is magnificent b/w cinematography- rich in shadows and geometric patterns, and fine editing which shows off a Norman Rockwell-like presentation of day-to-day life in rural America. The standout scene, of course is Jennifer Jones and Robert Walker (married in real life but separating at the time of the film) parting at the train station. The Steiner score (echoing the chugging of the train) and especially Jones' tearful run after the departing train are especially heartbreaking. (Does she sense her soldier's fate? Note the tragic, almost psychic expression on her face as she reads the engraving on the watch.) Good performances also from Agnes Moorehead and Selznick veteran Hattie McDaniel. Nominated for a ton of Oscars, and deservedly so.",1076371200,,1597,5.076045627376426
2100606,5,B0002KPHZ6,"I respectfully disagree that this is a film for women only.  I've loved this film since I first saw it as a teenager.  Claudette Colbert was never better than in her role as Ann Hilton; she manages to balance passion and dignity in her own unique manner.  Joseph Cotton is unmatched as the family's best friend, so suave and yet sensitive.  I've always been a great admirer of the underrated Agnes Moorhead, and she rivals her part in ""Dark Passage"" with her role as a flighty and selfish man-chaser here.  Monty Wooley was every bit as memorable here as in ""The Man Who Came to Dinner"".  Shirley Temple's part was somewhat limited but she proved herself well.

I found it awkward when the immigrant co-worker of Colbert recited the Lazarus poem off the Statue of Liberty, particularly in view of the segregation of American society and the military.  That couldn't be helped in this production, of course.

The entire production is typical of the best of Hollywood then--in other words, yet to be matched by today's filmmakers.  The richness of the black-and-white, the basic camera work, the perfect sets.  It's why I love these old films.

True, this film is a tearjerker.  Nothing wrong with that.  True, it might be viewed as a form of propoganda.  Nothing wrong with that, either.  It remains an eloquent testament to a nation and a time when the 'bad guys' were easy to identify.  At the least, I hope viewing this will remind all of us to contribute to the WW II Memorial in Washington!

BTW when is this coming out on DVD?

PS--11/26/04--I just got the DVD version--fantastic video and sound quality, all one could ask.  Still the classic, still with an emotional honesty sadly lacking in more modern films.",1070150400,,1716,4.713804713804714
2100607,3,B0002KPHZ6,"A maudlin flag-waver supreme, this is strictly for the ladies, and their handkerchiefs. This World War II saga is set during the time the 'boys' are away at war and is primarily a long lament for them, as well as a recruiting poster and a ""do-your-bit-for-the-war-effort"" rally. If this film doesn't cause you to enlist in the military, start a scrap materials drive, or volunteer in a soldiers' hospital, nothing will. A capable and attractive cast helps this 2-1/2+ hour sermon to nationalism. Today, it would be offensive to the Japanese when one man mocks the epicanthic eye fold of them and refers to them as ""Japs.""
Guy Madison makes his film debut in the short bowling alley scene with a few lines, and he was actually in the military at the time (wasn't everyone?). He should have been used in more films (rumor has it that the Hollywood execs said he was too handsome to be realistic, though it must be admitted that he tends to be a little bit wooden) but did perhaps his best work in another WWII film: ""Till The End Of Time"" two years later. ""Since You Went Away"" was also the debut film for another actor also neglected because he was excessively handsome: John Derek as an extra, but I couldn't find him in the movie as shown un-cut on PBS. He was the father of Bo Derek, but we won't hold that against him. Max Steiner's score is beautiful, but far from greatness, yet if I am not mistaken, a part of it constituted the basis for the main theme for the 50s TV series ""Father Knows Best."" In a way, this film is a time capsule, and can be enjoyed on that level alone.",1060041600,,1581,4.417808219178082

2100610,4,B0002KPHZ6,"What a pleasure for this Brit.to see how a typical American family coped with their men away helping to fight WW11. Claudette Colbert plays the mother(Anne Hilton) who's husband Timothy Hilton (who was in advertising) has joined up leaving her and two daughters (Shirley Temple and Jennifer Jones) to cope on their own. Although they have a black maid, money is tight.(I thought US advertising executives were paid a fortune!).To make ends meet Anne Hilton takes in a lodger - an irrascible retired colonel played by Monty Wooley. Love interest is provided by the appearance of the colonel's grandson (Robert Walker) who has bismirched the family name and been discharged from West Point military academy although he has signed up as a mere corporal in the US army. What is interesting is that Jennifer and Robert who married in 1939 had just broken up their real marriage (despite having 2 sons together)during filming yet had to play convincing love scenes together. That is acting!.The ""villainess"" is played by Agnes Moorhead (the black market queen) who was still playing baddies in the 1960's Batman tv series. Finally Joseph Cotton plays the love lorn ""boyfriend"" of Anne Hilton despite getting propositioned by two likely ladies during the film. A very fine performance from all concerned including all the supporting actors. It was a nice touch to have Anne Hilton learning to spot weld thus doing ""her bit"" for the US war effort and earning a few ""bob"" to boot. It was more effective not seeing Timothy Hilton - just impressions of him. If any of your viewers have seen the British TV series ""Minder"" you never see Arthur Daley's ""'er indoors"" but the imagination makes the absent character more powerful than could be portrayed by an actor in the flesh.",1001894400,,1764,4.922818791946309

2100612,5,B0002KPHZ6,"among sentimental tearjerkers in this classic tale of the brave American women who keep the homefires burning during the dark days of WWII. The title refers to all that is happening to one American family while the father is away at war. Claudette Colbert stars as the mother with Jennifer Jones and Shirley Temple as her daughters. Joseph Cotten is the old family friend who may or may not be in love with Colbert, Monty Wooley the crusty lodger the family takes in to earn some money. Through Wooley enters into the family his grandson Robert Walker, a shy soldier with whom Jennifer Jones eventually falls in love.  ""Since You Went Away"" is second only to ""How Green Was My Valley"" for annual tearfall in my lowly opinion. Made at the height of the actual war, this movie captured and preserved for our later generations the terrible experience of trying to go on with a normal life as loved ones were facing death at the front. Yet there is joy too for this family as they go about the ordinary things through which our happiness comes. There are other vignettes depicting minor characters, featuring situations familiar to the wartime audience, which now are like so many time capsules for us more than fifty years after the war. A wonderful movie that would move even the most cynical viewer, ""Since You Went Away"" is tops in my books.",996883200,,1341,4.658227848101266
2100613,3,B0002KPHZ6,"I can guarantee you that if anyone but David O. Selznick had written this movie, it would have been no longer than an hour and a half.  As it is, Since You Went Away clocks in at something around 180 minutes, a famous producer's self-indulgence.  For the most part, it is wonderfully cast, my favorite role being Monty Woolley's retired colonel who adds a nice compensation to the rampant sentimentality.  Claudette Colbert is wonderful, but she can do absolutely nothing wrong in my mind, just as Robert Walker, as her daughter's love interest, can do nothing right.  That actor has always irritated me (his sleazy appearance and scratchy voice better served in a sinister role), so take my deeply subjective criticism with a grain of salt.  Innocents die, feuds are resolved, tears are shed, and I must say, for someone who can't stand maudlin movies, much of it seemed sincere enough to me and occasionally quite affecting.",987638400,,926,4.872611464968153
2100614,5,B0002KPHZ6,"This is a great l944 movie from David Selznick (""Gone with the Wind"") to watch around the holidays, especially on a snowy afternoon because some of the best scenes in this classic occur against a wintry backdrop and at Christmas. Claudette Colbert portrays Ann Hilton, the courageous mother of two daughters: sensitive, romantic Jennifer Jones and her earthy, likeable sister, Shirley Temple. Throughout the movie, you see how they try to cope in an America of the 40s with World War II raging and Mr. Hilton has gone off to fight the enemy. The Gone-With-the-Wind long length sparkles with numerous great turns by Hollywood's greatest: Hattie McDaniel as Vadelia, the legendary Nazimova as a Russian emigrant,Agnes Morehead as the vicious, shallow hypocrite (a role she mastered in), etc. Selznick later wished he had filmed this classic in color. But the ravishing photography shimmers in its luscious black and white. Shadows galore, great crane shots, windows always sparkling from rain or gleaming with snow. A fascinating, poignant look at a long-ago America during World War II, where hearths always crackled invitingly, families sat around playing cards for fun (no TV yet) and Western Union could deliver news that horrified or give one hope. The final scene of the Hilton women, gathered close together as they read that fateful telegram is unforgettable. Selznick wanted this movie to outdo his mythical masterpiece, ""Gone with the Wind."" Of course it didn't. There's only one GWTW but ""Since You Went Away"" certainly played to tens of millions of movie goers during the 40s (it's listed as one of Hollwood's all-time highest grossing movies)and once you've seen it, you'll never forget Ann Hilton and Daughters as they struggle to keep the homefront strong. By the way, the unlucky unknown actor playing Mr. Hilton had all of his scenes cut out and you only see him briefly as a framed photograph.

This movie was meant as a reminder of just what the men were fighting for, and sentimental as it is, was a good snapshot of peoples' concerns and hopes and travails during WWII.  This movie has myriad characters and various story lines to give it a rich, textured feel, like an old family quilt made up of many old, beloved clothes.
