8095563,5,B000C3L2BG,"I would suggest this movie to anyone who loved Teddy Ruxpin as a child, or for their children now. I loved it, it was just how I remembered the show. The picture was good, the sound was good. I just can't say anything but it was aswesome to see these shows again, and I loved them as an adult just as much as I loved then when I was little.",1187222400,,340,3.8714285714285714

8095565,5,B000C3L2BG,This was my favorite show as a child.  I'm trilled that I'll be able to introduce my neices and nephews to this amazing show. These two volumes give us 11 of the 65 episodes...I hope that the rest are quickly released!,1140912000,2,218,4.317073170731708
8095566,5,B000C3L2BG,"This show was my childhood in a nutshell, and, after watching my 20-year-old videotapes about a hundred times, I realized an upgrade was necessary if theses stories were to survive for children of the next generation.  Needless to say, I've waited a long time to see ""The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin"" on DVD.

  In a time where many children are stuck in front of a Playstation or Xbox, this show encourages activity.  No, not the ""do-along"" type, but it gets kids interested in discovering things about the world around them.  It teaches good, wholesome lessons, but not in a preachy, dogmatic way.  Lessons are all taught in the context of the story, so that kids learn along WITH Teddy and not FROM Teddy.  They are never talked down to or treated as students.  They're there for the adventure, which brings me to the story.

  Any fan of fantasy will appreciated the subtle depth of the Land of Grundo.  Creatures abound with rich character and unique personalities.  The plot is consistent and exciting.  In short, Teddy must protect six magic crystals from falling into the hands of Quellor, the Supreme Opressor of the Monsters & Villains Organization (M.A.V.O.)  Meanwhile, Teddy, Grubby, and Gimmick uncover secrets of Grundo, Illiops, and Teddy's past, all the while learning valuable lessons.  The plot is continuous from episode to episode, so you feel like you're part of an epic story rather than just random adventures.  The story gets bigger as the episodes progress, so by the end, what may have felt like a children's show, becomes a single, thick, twisting turning adventure.  The story is Teddy's strongest aspect, and should be enjoyed by many.

  I was happy with these DVD's. My only complaint was quality at certain points. Obviously, the source material is 20 years old, so I wasn't exactly expecting super-quality. At some points during the first five episodes, the picture would get a little choppy, and in one or two episodes, the tracking was clearly off for a second or so. In Episodes 7-11 (the second volume,) the sound would ""warp"" a couple of times per episode. Other than that, these are great to have, and for the price, you really can't argue with them. There are ""bonus"" music videos of ""Baby Felix"", which I found annoying at best (being totally unrelated to the series), but they're all under 1 min. 30 sec., so I guess it wasn't a huge problem. I'm glad they included a ""Play All"" button so I could just sit back and watch and not have to worry about menu navigation.

  Nothing too special in the menus. A shot of Teddy against a ""woodsy"" backdrop with the opening music of the first episode playing in the background (which I actually like very much for this...) There are no submenus, no chapter menus for each episode, but if you press the >>| button on the remote, it does jump to the next ""chapter"" in the episode.

  There are 14 Teddy Ruxpin episodes I know I've never seen. Hopefully these DVD's will be the cure.  On a side note, if you go to ""[...]"" First National PIctures, they have a section dedicated to Teddy's DVD's. There is a third volume there called ""The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin: The Fun Road Ahead"", along with a supposed ""The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin Box Set"", which, as described on the site, will contain the first four volumes along with a special ""Bonus DVD."" Wonder if it will have anything special on it, like interviews with cast/crew or something like that, maybe a short documentary of Teddy's beginnings.

  If you are even remotely familiar with this series, you will want to pick this up.  It is fun, interesting, wholesome entertainment that's not sugary sweet or predictably simple.  There's a continuous, sprawling story, rich characters, a consistent world, and wholesome lessons for kids to learn without the dictation of other shows.  A personal favorite for all time.",1140825600,7,3854,4.787878787878788
8095567,5,B000C3L2BG,"This is the 2nd set of episodes of the creativity-inspiring cartoon of the 80's, The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin. Here, Teddy's friend Gimmick, the inventor, begins to discover how valuable the crystals they found are. When he plugs one into a machine, something incredible happens! These episodes also reveal more story about the humorous villain Tweeg.

The plot continues from one episode to the next across the whole series, but at the same time each individual episode has it's own development and conclusion. Each story is very clever, and the music (both in the songs, and the background music) is memorable. Everyone who watched this when they were young will find themselves humming these tunes again as soon as they hear them!

If you liked the first disc, then this DVD gives you more of the stories, characters, and songs that you loved. And if you haven't seen the first disc yet, you're really missing out on a wonderful series!",1140480000,4,941,4.875
