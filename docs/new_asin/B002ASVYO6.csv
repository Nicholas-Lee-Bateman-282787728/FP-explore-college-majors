3891504,5,B002ASVYO6,"This movie covers the fight by a group of south central families to avoid having a 13 acre garden in South Central Los Angeles destroyed.  There is a lot of detailed history of this battle, but the producers skillfully focused on presenting the major events and players in order to give the viewer an understanding of the conflict, rather than presenting the details of the litigation surrounding the 13 acres.

The summary is this: after LA police officers were acquitted of charges of beating Rodney King, one of the things L.A. did to try to improve community relations was to help start a community garden on 13 acres.  The film gives ground level and aerial views of the lush garden that resulted with plots tended by local families, mostly spanish speaking immigrants.  There were banana, walnut and papaya trees, corn, lettuces, squash, etc.  It was open from dawn to dusk. Families, senior citizens and children all worked together and they eventually developed a democratically based group that set rules and alloted land, and represented them in their fight to keep it when the garden was slated for destruction by a developer purchasing it from the city.

This film covers many issues of American society that we have struggled with for over 100 years - poor nutrition in low income neighborhoods, community building, minority rights and representation, land development and political dealmaking, the conflicts between different ethnic low income groups, community activism, etc.

After watching the film I was saddened and angered at what in the end really killed the garden - the anger of the developer who said he wouldn't sell the land at ANY price.  Despite national attention, celebrity involvement, funding from the Annenburg foundation to buy the land at a fair price, etc. etc. one man had the power to destroy or preserve the community garden, and he choose to destroy it.

However, today I did some online research to see what has happened to the south central farmers since the destruction of their garden.  Though they lost the battle, they have gone on to develop a new garden elsewhere, and are using it to provide low income families with fresh fruits and vegetables, to provide education on nutrition and organic gardening, and now to generate income by selling produce to a Whole Foods store. I'm thrilled to see that these people have gone on to build something even bigger, and perhaps provide healthy food for more families. However, the new garden isn't in the community, and I would guess that less people from south central are able to be involved each day due to the distance from the current garden to their community.

This is a great film to watch with children as it illustrates the difficulties of immigrants, the importance of exercising democratic rights, how the political and legal system work, how community organizers who have accomplished great things sometimes later use their power to enrich themselves at their communities' expense, how we struggle with our prejudices against people with less education, lower income, and lack of facility with the English language.

There is no voice over filling in all the details, which would be a distraction from what is going on with the people in this movie.  This is its strength - we must watch and listen and come to our own conclusions about the players involved though it seems quite obvious by the end of the film what is motivating the different parties. However, I'm not sure I truly know what many of the politicians did, chose not to do, and might have done, to help the farmers of South Central. If you like documentaries where everything is explained/settled/concluded you will be frustrated by this. But I think it is better that the film was done in this way because this is how life happens - we come to conclusions about the motivations of others, and what is happening ""behind the scenes"", but in many cases we will never know and must go forward doing the best we can with the information we CAN get.",1266105600,6,4011,4.872246696035242

After the riots of 1992, the city of Los Angeles set aside fourteen acres of land not far from the downtown area to be used as a community produce garden, the largest such parcel in the United States.  In 2003, the owner of the property decided to sell the land to make way for a storage facility and soccer field, resulting in a tremendous loss for the farmers who had invested so much of their time and lives working there.  The documentary ""The Garden,"" directed by Scott Hamilton Kennedy, chronicles the fight the workers waged against the powers-that-be to preserve the place that had come to mean so much to them.

The issue eventually became a cause celebre for politicians and celebrities alike, with people like Dennis Kucinich, Darryl Hannah, Joan Baez and Willie Nelson getting in on the action.  But the true heroes of ""The Garden"" are the ordinary men and women who took on the system and proved that even if you can't always beat City Hall, it would be a betrayal of the human spirit not to at least give it a try.  This is a heartrending yet inspiring film - if a trifle rough around the edges - marked by the bitterness of outward defeat and the triumph of a community rising up and making its voice heard.  The ""villains"" may be pretty clear-cut in this case - lip-service politicians, shady dealers and a vindictive landowner - but then so too are the heroes.  ""The Garden"" is their story.",1261526400,,1415,4.543307086614173

3891507,2,B002ASVYO6,"While the film itself is interesting and well done, the biggest problem I have with this film is its lie of omission. At its core, the film is about a simple property rights issue, however the director chooses not to focus on the real issues of the conflict, instead focusing on the plight of the urban poor and painting all others involved as ""greedy, evil politicians and developers"". Its not mentioned if the people farming the land had ever had any right to do so to begin with, regardless of whether the property was owned by the district, city, or a private entity. Perhaps they should have bothered to secure the right to use the land for agricultural purposes to begin with. But to not do so, and then claim that they have eminent domain over the land because they have put it to use is not a valid argument to seize private or public property.

If the owner of the property happened to be a better cook than any of them, could he make the case that he should seize ownership of their kitchens? If I (and three of my neighbors) can put your back yard to use better than you can, does that give me the right to claim ownership of it?

Its this issue that is not directly addressed by anyone but the owner of the property at the end of the film (complete with ""evil"" rock music and scenes of crying protesters and bulldozers) which is the core and cause of the situation. The farmers and the filmmaker conveniently decided to omit much discussion of the origin of or ways of property rights upon which our entire society is based. This is not to say I agree with it, but to mostly ignore it is asinine.

Mostly good film, minus the blatant and intentional appeal to emotion rather than the issue itself.",1250985600,13,1709,4.401898734177215

3891509,4,B002ASVYO6,"I saw this film at an IFC screening in NYC that included a Q&A with the director afterward. People who advocate of the rights of the poor to use under-used urban land almost universally love this film. I suspect the director shares their sympathies. What usually goes unnoticed as far as the story is concerned is that the city took private land through eminent domain and then failed to use the land for any of the public purposes for which land seizures are normally reserved. After the passage of several years, the city then sold the land back to the original owner at the price they'd originally paid him. On the surface, this does not seem 'unfair'. However, in the interim poor immigrants, many of whom were presumably undocumented, began to farm the land. That Hamilton failed to document whether or not these people were undocumented, whether any particular viewer feels this is germane or not, is a minor flaw in the film. Of course, their immigration status would have been a difficult topic to broach with the immigrants themselves and might have changed the filmmaker's access to the immigrant community, but it might also have served to highlight the differences between the immigrant community and the allegedly corrupt city counselors who were elected by the poor Black residents of the area. Be that as it may, Hamilton does a good job with the documents available to present the complexity of the situation, if only in passing. I spoke to Hamilton after the screening. He'd already sold the few DVDs he had with him for $20 and urged me to call or email him for a copy. I've done both, but only get an answering machine or a form email telling me the DVD is available, because of my university affiliation, for $310, even though I have no plans to use the DVD in an educational setting.",1250467200,5,1804,4.694006309148265

This movie really made me angry (any movie that incites some sort of strong emotion in me is regarded as a good movie in my  book!).  The unfairness of the conflict is so aggravating that I found myself yelling at the TV screen. I just cannot comprehend the actions that some people take just because they have the power.  The actions are not reasonably rationalized, and it just really sucks for the underdogs.

A heartbreaking true story of how the largest urban form in America was razed to the ground by corrupt politicians and an over zealous land owner.

More than the story of a farm, it is a commentary on the human condition and the desire to live one's life with dignity.
