8092754,4,B000BTM04E,"This is what you would expect from footage in the 1960's. It's Black and White and gives a snapshot of each year. Each year has a recap of the World Series too. I would give it 5 stars but the footage ends after the 2nd game of the 1967 World Series, it was no surprise who won that one Red Sox vs Cards.",1418256000,2,304,3.8412698412698414
