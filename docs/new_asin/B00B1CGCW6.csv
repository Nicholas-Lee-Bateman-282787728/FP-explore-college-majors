5543953,1,B00B1CGCW6,"All these westerns were made before the hit""STAGECOACH"".I have them all. But now their being re-release for to much money..like $15.00 or $19.00. I am a 100% JOHN WAYNE FAN..however these are his low budget..poor sound westerns in the early 1930's. However I will say..the rerelease of his..THREE MESQUITEERS adventures are good. Music background keeps the action going. But all of his other pre westerns such as ""The Lawless Nineties'you won't want to pay that kind of price for sure. When they came out on vhs..they were like $8.00. Then they put them out on dvd a few years ago....no different today. Except...The THREE MESQUITEERS was pretty good. And for that high price..these wsterns(all)run just under 1-hour each. For that price it's not fair. Thankyou J.R.",1364688000,9,766,5.087301587301587

SYNOPSIS--
Wyoming Territory natives John Tipton (Wayne) and his partner Bridges (Chandler) are Justice Dept. agents who've been sent to their native area to monitor an all-important statehood vote. By using dynamite and other means, certain unscrupulous men have already gone to great lengths to terrorize honest local ranchers, homesteaders and merchants interested in joining the Union. It's Tipton's and Bridger's job to prevent such intimidation and make a fair vote possible.

Major Carter (Hayes in an atypical Southern sophisticate role), accompanied by daughter Janet (Rutherford), are escorted by Tipton to Crockett City from Virginia. Carter wants to start a newspaper to replace one that ceased operation after its editor was murdered. Bridges is shot in the back and killed, and the major is also mortally wounded while trying to break up a staged fistfight. With his last breath Carter asks Agent Tipton to watch over his daughter, who insists on assuming the editorship of her father's newspaper...

In 1890 Wyoming powerful forces (the cattle barons backed by NY financiers) opposed statehood and started a reign of terror to drive out small ranchers and homesteaders. [The movie Shane was another example.] The US Department of Justice sends operatives to Crockett City to ensure an honest election. John Tipton sees a runaway carriage and stops it. A gang at the border drives away homesteaders. Tipton prevents that carriage from being turned back. Carter is the new owner of the local newspaper. [The Committee of Law and Order was often the Vigilante group.] Publisher Carter is for statehood, the Crockett City Blade will oppose those against it. He is warned about powerful forces; the last editor was shot.

One government man sends a coded telegram, but that identifies him. The two men of the gang attack Tipton but they are defeated. A dead man is brought in, shot in the back. Who is he? How does the gang know about gold shipments? Some gang members are paid to go away. But they are stopped by the City Marshal and Tipton. An old trick gets a confession from one. There is a fight outside, and one man shoots the editor in the back - an accident says the jury! Miss Janet will run the newspaper. The gang plans to knockover a wagon load of silver. But they are surprised! A bunch of cowboys rider into town, shooting their pistols. [No laws against this.] Tipton is kidnapped and tied up. But he hears their plans and later escapes through a window then rides away quickly!

Tipton and the Government operatives are told to gather up the honest men. In Crockett City the polls are closed early to control voting. There is a posse of small ranchers and homesteaders coming, and they are armed. Can they be kept away by barricades? There is a lot of shooting. One man throws dynamite to destroy a barricade, the good guys ride into town. Does Steel know too much? Tipton climbs from a window of the Custer Hotel and stops the gang leader. The early returns show a complete victory: Wyoming will become a state! Tipton hugs Janet. The people triumphed with help from government men. [Was this the first Integrated Western (with colored folk)?]

The new state of Wyoming was the first state to allow women to vote - in state elections. This is one of the many movies that were inspired by the events known as the Johnson County War. The cattle barons hired cowboys from Texas to drive out small ranchers and homesteaders so they could grab their lands. The plan was to shoot the Sheriff and some County Commissioners then range over the county. But the people had been warned and gathered in a posse and hemmed in the gunmen until the US Army came to rescue the gunmen. You can read a history book on this event, they won't teach this in high school or college. One editor, A. S. Mercer, was driven out of the state but wrote the definitive book The Banditti of the Plains.",1426550400,2,2917,4.593090211132438
