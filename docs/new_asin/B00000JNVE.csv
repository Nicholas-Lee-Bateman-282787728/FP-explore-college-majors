1235256,4,B00000JNVE,"'Rich and Strange' begins with one of Hitchcock's most memorable sequences, a silent, Expressionist choreography opening on a mass of ordered, undifferentiable civil servants at their serried desks, just before closing time.  As the bell goes, their movements are as mechanical as their oppressively geometrical surroundings: this visual pattern is matched by the automated movements through space, as the men meet the women and streaming occupents of the buildings' other floors.  They emerge into the dreary rain and open their umbrellas two-by-two, with Busby Berkeley-like precision.  All except the hero, whose physical ineptness marks his relative individuality in this Kafka/Monty Python milieu - his umbrella breaks, he causes slapstick chaos on a crowded Tube.  Dwarfed by the humiliating privations of the rat race, he takes it out at home by bullying his wife and cat.
One cannot avoid the predictable: 'Rich and Strange' is one of Hitchcock's richest and strangest works, as arguably personal a film as 'Vertigo'.  Its central interest is the tragicomedy of marriage - just when Fred is most weighed down by existence, he is given an advance on his uncle's inheritance to travel and experience 'LIFE'.  On a world cruise, his wife grows chastely intimate with a batchelor officer who lives in Africa, while he lies seasick; later, he himself becomes involved with a gold-digging phoney princess.  As the 'magical' gift of the opportune money suggests, there is a fairy-tale quality to the film, with the voyage a space away from the everyday in which marriage is tested, other possibilities explored and weighed. Fred's misadventures only expose his cowardice and essential boorishness, but Emily's friendship with the Commander is especially poignant, particularly as backed by the snatches of slow dance music which now remind us irresistably of a vanished pre-war age.  The film's insights into marriage and relationships between men and women, are brutal, unromantic, disenchanted and unsentimental, but sardonically aware of the restrictive age the characters live in.
But the weightiness of the theme is offset by the eccentricity of the handling, deliciously flippant even by the giddy standards of Hitchcock's British films, which are as playful and unpredictable as the Hollywood classics are smooth and controlled.  Interspersing the main story with travelogue (Paris, North Africa, Singapore etc.), Hitchcock employs a variety of proto-New Wave devices, which are not 'tricksy' because they connect to the film's themes - strange jump cuts, camera angles and montages; jerky scene construction; mocking intertitles and farcically-orchestrated bits of business (including an elderly spinster, lunging and interfering like Miss Mapp, who is the butt of many cruel jokes, her entrance signalled by comic music); weird plot developments (including a climactic interlude on a Chinese junder - lovers of cats, look away!); a brilliant, Lang-influenced soundtrack, fragmenting music with real and exagerrated sound; a sometimes beautiful, dreamy sense of composition (e.g. moonlit shots of the liner like a ghost ship); the surreal staging of certain scenes; the unrestrained deployment of gags; the racy visual doubles (and singles) entendres; all disorienting the audience as much as this strange new world does the limited English heroes.  The film is littered with motifs that would characterise Hitchcock's more famous works.  If you're looking for the linear, steadily mounting suspense plot for which Hitchcock is famous, you will be disappointed; if you want to see Hitchcock in more idiosyncratic, 'The Trouble With Harry'-mode, this may just surprise you.",1011571200,13,3681,5.520426287744227
1235257,2,B00000JNVE,"This is a weird little movie.  Not typical Hitchcock fare by any stretch of the imagination.  Not suspense, kind of a drama with a bit of comedy mixed in.  Most of it plays kind of like a travelogue-- this couple inherits some money and go on an extended vacation.  This Laserlight DVD edition includes a brief, but very entertaining, introduction by Tony Curtis.  He hosts many of the old movies Laserlight has released to DVD.  He has a very bizarre way of delivering these little intros that provide some background info on the film.  This disc also includes the original theatrical trailer for Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", as well as a half-hour episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.  So even though the movie is nothing to write home about, if you have an interest in early Hitchcock you can't beat this one, considering the low cost.",981417600,2,832,4.769230769230769
1235258,3,B00000JNVE,"'Rich and Strange' isn't a thriller and there are none of Hitchcock's trademark suspense scenes, in fact I'd describe it as a 'light-hearted adventure'. The saving grace of this early Hitchcock talkie is that it's  slightly off the wall. There are just some scenes when you think 'is this  guy serious or just taking the Mickey'? Contrary to what I've heard  elsewhere, Joan Barry and Henry Kendall make quite good leads and there is  enough of a storyline to keep the viewer interested. So, if you're thinking  of buying some early Hitchcock material this DVD is worth a look,  especially at Laserlight's budget price.",962064000,2,619,4.903846153846154

1235292,4,B00000JNVE,"Like much of Alfred Hitchcock's work up through 1934, 1931's RICH AND STRANGE (aka EAST OF SHANGHAI) is NOT a thriller or mystery, but rather a more conventional domestic drama, in this case one involving a couple on an adventure that becomes more than they bargained for.  Fred Hill (Henry Kendall) is a minor office drone who dreams of an exciting life, preferably involving the sea; his wife Emily (Joan Berry) is a bit more content, but when Fred gets an early inheritance from a rich uncle, she joins him enthusiastically enough on an around the world trip.  After an uneventful quick journey through France, the couple takes ship bound for the East - and Fred rapidly becomes and stays ill.  Emily meanwhile becomes friendly with the charming and slightly reserved Commander Gordon (Percy Marmont) who makes bid to steal her heart - and when Fred's stomach regains it's stability, he soon makes the acquaintance of ""The Princess"" (Betty Amann) who has much the same affect on him.  Soon the two are both contemplating other lives...but complications, inevitably, occur.

This is a solid romance with some adventurous elements, particularly later in the film as our pair face problems on a sinking ship.  Though made after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Skin-Game/dp/6303073816/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Skin Game</a>, from the same year, it betrays more leftover elements of the silent cinema early on, with significant use of title cards in the first third of the film, and though the narrative is less inherently stagy than the earlier film (which was adapted from a play), it feels a bit more generic and predictable on the whole.  The camerawork is just as impressive as in the earlier film, with a quite stunning virtuoso 360-degree pan to open the film which promises spectacle that isn't quite delivered - though the technical quality is fine throughout.  The acting is generally quite good as well, with special notice given to Joan Berry, a petite and gorgeous young blonde who alas retired all too soon.  She has quite a screen presence and probably gives the best performance in the film, never overacting as her partner Kendall sometimes ends up doing.

For my money then this is relatively minor Hitchcock, but almost nothing in the director's work is disposable, and this isn't one of those few poor exceptions - it's a good example of his early style with actresses, for one thing; no icy ""Hitchcock blondes"" on display here, though I suppose ""The Princess"" is something like a later femme fatale character.  My disc is similar to but not exactly the same as the one in the photo here; it's Korean I think but I can't be certain as there's nothing in English on it.  Like just about all of Hitch's work through the mid-30s this film is in public domain and available on zillions of labels; unlike the aforementioned THE SKIN GAME, most of the copies seem to be fairly decent with only a bit of hiss marring the sound for perhaps a quarter of the film, and a pretty decent picture in most cases.  As in my review of the other film, I'd recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Alfred-Hitchcock-Box-Set/dp/B000KJU12S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Alfred Hitchcock Box Set</a>, which also includes THE RING, THE MANXMAN and THE SKIN GAME - all among Hitch's best work from the late 20s and early 30s - if you want the best quality.",1290816000,2,3451,5.152057245080501
1235293,4,B00000JNVE,"This is a review of the recently released Laserlite DVD version of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rich and Strange."" I'll warn you now that I am going to talk less about the plot of the film and more about the DVD transfer.
This film, about a young married couple who suddenly inherit a fortune and decide to waste it all on a world cruise, certainly lives up to the second half of its title, as it is my vote for the strangest film Hitchcock has ever been ever associated with. It's not a bad film, it's just strange. There are numerous brilliant Hitchcock touches which other reviewers have dwelled on, so I won't bother to touch upon.
The thing that really catches your attention (especially if you a fan of old films on DVD) is the wonderful transfer! The contrast levels are consistant throughout for the most part, there are very few digital transfer artifacts, very few missing frames (a common occurrence on low budget transfers of classic Public Domain films,) very few instinces of dirt and other film blemishes; and, with the exception of only a very few scenes, a shockingly small amount of film pops, hiss and other examples of soundtrack deteriation. I have all 14 Hitchcock DVDs that Laserlite has released and none of them look this good! In some ways this is unfortunate, since this is certainly not Hitchcock's best film and the films that are more entertaining and more often viewed suffer from bad transfers, but on the other hand, it's also, undoubtedly, one of the last Hitchcock films that Criterion would get around to restoring, so it's good for the completist to have this excellent transfer. It appears that Laserlite may have transferred this from a 35mm print and not one of the mediocre 16mm prints that so many other classic films transfers suffer from. While it's not on Criterion's quality control level (or even that of the recent MCA Hitchcock releases,) this is probably the best looking transfer of any movie you'll ever be able to obtain ...and certainly the best transfer of ""Rich and Strange"" that I've come across.
Along with this release is a trailer for Psycho, the typically weird introduction by Tony Curtis (he hosts almost all of these Hitchcock Laserlite DVDs and often talks more about the additional trailer than the movie we're about to watch) and a never-aired episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents in poor condition which was not directed by Hitchcock.
On this extremely rare occasion, Hitchcock gets 3 stars for his film, but Laserlite gets 4 for their packaged product.",1043971200,12,2512,4.81712962962963
1235294,4,B00000JNVE,"This movie, apparantly loosely based on Hitchcock's marriage, was a real treat. I enjoyed it from start to finish.
Joan Barry is particularly lovely, and you may wonder why she puts up with her husband's rather shabby treatment of her.
The story doesn't end happily, in fact we are back where we started, having learned nothing!",1037923200,,328,4.875
1235295,3,B00000JNVE,"(Review note: I am reviewing the Laserlight DVD double feature of RICH AND STRANGE  and THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE.  It's the one with Alfred Hitchcock on the cover holding a broken down umbrella.)
RICH AND STRANGE is one of the more bizarre movies that I've experienced.  It has several appealing features to it, yet it never feels coherent.  Viewers expecting to see familiar suspense-filled fare here will be disappointed, as there is very little of the usual Hitchcockian death and destruction.
The film really is a bit of a mess, albeit a mess that at times is fairly entertaining.  It begins as a comedy, using sight gags that have their basis firmly in the silent era.  Then the humour starts to fizzle out and we are introduced to the story of a married couple who want to see the world.  Amazingly, within the span of a couple of minutes, their dreams come true, and they race aboard a luxury liner intent on a life of travel and idleness.
Once onboard the ship the plot cools its boots while a cheesy romance subplot begins.  The husband of the couple begins an affair with a vampy single woman who professes to be a Princess (no doubt of some generic European country) and the wife begins hanging around a dull aristocrat.  I won't give away any more of the plot, except to say that after the long and fairly boring romantic subplot that's neither entertaining or interesting, pirates show up and do nothing except act strange and do weird things.
The story just doesn't know what it wants to be.  It starts off as a comedy, then switches to drama, then has an attempt at romance, then becomes an adventure tale.  It finally shudders to a halt, but not before it has tried its hand at several more unrelated genres.  It has the feel of a movie that was slapped together out of multiple unrelated scripts.  The problem is that while none of the segments are especially terrible (although the romances are not awfully engaging), they just don't work together at all.  Characters who would seem to be sympathetic in one portion are suddenly acting in a completely different manner only a few scenes later.
RICH AND STRANGE has traces of Hitchcock's humour present, but as a whole, it turns out to be much less than the sum of its parts.  It never establishes the characters, therefore it is hard to feel much sympathy for all the weirdness that befalls them.  Possibly very telling is the fact that in the introduction, Tony Curtis seems much more interested in talking about how great of a film PSYCHO was than in discussing the movie that is actually on the disc.
The DVD also contains an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents that was never shown as part of its original network airing.  The film quality on this isn't terribly great, but the story itself is well up to the standards of that television series.  It's a typical suspense filled thriller that will keep you glued to your seat all the way through.  It's effective, although nothing terribly special.  It's well worth the time spent viewing it, and it makes for an entertaining extra.",1012089600,11,3055,4.664179104477612

People in an office work to 6 PM. They take the Underground Railway home. One man returns to his home. [Note the manual sewing machine.] He wants a better life. A letter from a rich uncle offers him money for a better life. They cross the channel on their way to Paris. They see the sights. They visit the Folies Bergre. Prayer before bedtime. Then to Marseilles for a cruise ship to the Far East. The sun sets, a man talks to Emily. Fred suffers from mal de mer. There are shipboard activities. Commander Gordon talks to Emily and spends time with her. Fred is still abed. Then Fred recovers, but is hit by a thrown game piece. They see Port Said. Merchants offer goods for sale. Fred and Emily become separated. Then its the Suez Canal and Carnival. Fred spends time with the Princess. She says Cabin 19"". Fred dances with another woman.

Emily spends time with Gordon. The voyage comes to an end. And the shipboard romance? They arrive at Singapore. Gordon tells Emily that the Princess is an adventuress, just out for Freds money. Emily returns to Fred and talks. Is everybody a sham? Fred refuses t listen; goodbye. Gordon sends a goodbye letter to Emily. Fred learns the Princess has left him after borrowing 1,000! This left him nearly penniless. They take a cheap boat home. There is a bang, people run around. They are trapped in their cabin! Im sorry. They escape through the porthole. What can they do now? A Chinese ship arrives, men climb aboard to scavenge. Their ship sinks. They are fed. Finally they return home wiser and poorer. Or are they? They bicker again.

This is a comedy of manners where a couples dreams of happiness lead to unexpected problems. There is a lesson to this. Many people who win a lottery prize spend it all then go bankrupt. Was Commander Gordon teamed with the Princess for this scam?",1456012800,,1856,4.5675675675675675

7912888,3,B00000JNVE,"This is not my favorite Hitchcock film and can hardly be called a suspense film. It appears to be a film made soon after audio was added to the technology of film-making but yet some of the acting style, timing of dialogue responses, and title cards make the film see awkward. This is understandable since the film was made in 1931. However, the small charm of the film are these very awkward left-over from earlier periods of film-making. The other charm of the film is Joan Barrys leading performance as Emily Hill, the delightful wife of a foolish man. Joan Barry is very beautiful in a home-town girl way and her acting is the highlight of the film. The film is somewhat of a romantic comedy where a young lower-middle class couple come into some money and decide to take a world cruise where both are tempted by romance with partners that have qualities that their spouse may not have. Whereas Joan Barry as Emily Hill is a highlight, Henry Kendall as Fred Hill was a bit problematic as a character. He is a bit foolish about the world around him despite the fact that he thinks he is more sophisticated than his wife. He is not as grateful for such a fine wife as he should be, in my opinion, and I could not help but take Emily Hills side in the situation comedy.  Emily meets and eventually falls for Commander Gordon, played by Percy Marmont, who eventually gives his opinion of Fred Hill, with which most viewers would agree.  Fred remains a fool even though the couple must go through some adventures to finally rebuild their relationship. There are scenes that are fascinating such as the Hills finding themselves alone on a sinking ship in the China Sea or having the sinking ship overtaken by Chinese cat eating pirates. This may be my least favorite Hitchcock film but if you watch it, you will be entertained by the awkwardness of the film-making combined with some typical Hitchcock imagery.",1419033600,,1908,4.608823529411764
