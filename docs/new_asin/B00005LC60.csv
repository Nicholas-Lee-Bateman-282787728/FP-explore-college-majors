7943652,5,B00005LC60,"I give this movie 5 stars because I knew what I was getting prior to buying it.  The movie does not have great sound, the picture is grainy, the actors are so-so...that is because this movie was not shot to be put on DVD..or vhs for that matter.  It was cheaply done and the results are great.  The director is the main character and the writing is clever and there are characters and more characters.  Anyone who has written knows how difficult it is to development a large group of characters and this movie pulls it off nicely.

The party starts and the charcaters roll in and so does the fun.  You will see many of the same characters you see at parties you have been to in the past.  You have the early birds drinking up the beers, the dorks being anti-social, the teaser girls dissing the guys...its a good time.  Listen in on the conversations as dorks get shot time after time.  There are several clever storylines that play out in the movie and this makes it great to watch time and time again.  Watching the director's dialogue along with several of the actors makes the movie even more enjoyable as they tell the secrets and the problems that arose during the filming of the movie.

If you are into independent films and do not need ocsar nominated acting to sit and enjoy a movie, this one gives you as much entertainment as any I've seen in a while.  I was glad i bought it and can't wait to watch it with my buddies.  Another decent movies for fans of independent comedy is Counseling Day which can be purchased on their website.  Another cheaply made comedy, lots of characters, lots of corny jokes.",1098316800,,1614,4.4271186440677965
7943653,3,B00005LC60,"This DVD was calling my name from the shelves at ""The Wherehouse"". Specifically, the attractive girl on the cover was calling my name..and I answered, taking her home, hoping to see more of her. Alas, she is not in the movie. O well. Despite the ""bait and switch"" it's a mildly entertaining picture, none the less. But from the full screen presentation to the severely grainy picture, sloppy editing and the uneven sound quality, there's not much here technically to ""wow"" anyone. And the acting gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ""stilted"". William Shatner looks like Robert De Niro in comparison to these actors, with few exceptions, most notably the girl harboring a secret crush on the main character. She's good. So, we fall back on the story....and there's not much there either. It has a certain voyeuristic quality to it, like you're wandering aimlessly at the party, catching snippets of conversations here and there, never staying in one place long enough to form a bond with anyone or get a real idea of what's going on. (speaking of voyeuristic..that handycam guy gets old after his first scene, to the point you wish someone would lock his butt in the bathroom..)
But, you have to applaud this as a first effort, at least I hope it's a first effort for those involved. Somehow they got this picture made, first of all, and on the shelves. I'd love to see what the respective cast and crew are up to now. In short, it's not the greatest movie out there, but it has several funny parts and I can think of worse ways to spend $14.99 (ouch! that's brick and mortar for you...buy here and save! $$)",1078444800,,1611,4.616724738675958
7943654,1,B00005LC60,"The box states that this movie is ""The Complete Guidebook to Sex and Dating in the 21st Century.""  If that's true, then we are living in a seriously troubled century.  I honestly just don't understand what this movie has going for it.  Most of dialogue throughout it seems forced and there's hardly any character development -- except the ""main"" character, whose part is no larger than anyone else's in the film.  I especially could not understand how this movie won a ""Best Comedy"" award; at a few points, I laughed, but it wasn't because of the writing: it was because I couldn't believe how nondescript the film was.  It seems like nothing really happens, and then the film has no good dialogue to fall back on.
Also, I have no idea who the girl is on the cover, she's certainly not in the movie.",1018224000,,799,4.520833333333333
7943655,3,B00005LC60,"While I can't agree that ""Social Intercourse"" is the definitive party movie as it is called on the box, I can say it's an an enjoyable hour and a half.  The picture quality of the DVD is incredibly poor, making you wonder if the VHS even had better quality, but I assure you that it was the incredibly low-budget, not the transfer.  The actors here are under-trained, but the party seems real, as if it were a documentary of a party the filmmakers actually attended.  The features for the DVD are surprisngly vast, with an option to go behind the scenes every time a red baseball cap appears on screen (it's a draw-back when watching the movie, but for special feature buffs, it's a pleasure).  The series of odd characters make the film incredibly amusing, despite the grainy picture quality.",1009238400,,793,4.642857142857143
