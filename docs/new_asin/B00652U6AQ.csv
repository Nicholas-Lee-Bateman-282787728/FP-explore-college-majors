4960063,5,B00652U6AQ,"This was a spectacular book!  William Still is considered a Top Authority on the Underground Railroad. There is also a pbs.org DVD available.  My community college  students borrowed the book to help them write their research project.  There are tons of pithy
(short, deep, anecdotes) that are so meaningful.  Other books quote Wm. Still often. If there's only one book you want, make it this one!  Prof. Merry B.",1401321600,4,413,4.913043478260869
4960064,5,B00652U6AQ,"The story of William Still who was prominent conductor on  Underground Railroad is heartwarming. After purchasing the book on tape. I have viewed it several times.  The absolute courage shown by Mr. Still is awesome,  a free black man during slavery, working to offer freedom to  runaway slaves could have ended his life and plugged him into slavery. Knowing that fact he continued being a conductor on Underground Railroad. I was overjoyed to discover  Mr. Still and Sister Harriet Tubman worked together to free runaway slaves. She at times brought runaway slaves to Mr. Still's location for food, shelter and rest. In reading about both heroes and discovering different methods adapted to relay messages that escape to freedom was approaching as well as signals and tactics used in Philadelphia to inform members of Underground Railroad were simplistic yet effective.",1365120000,9,870,5.23021582733813
