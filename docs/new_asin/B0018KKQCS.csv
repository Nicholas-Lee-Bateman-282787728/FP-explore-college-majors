8269932,5,B0018KKQCS,"Found what I have been looking for after a long time.  There shipping was very quick and kept me up dated when they shipped it.  I would buy from them again.
For the anime that I bought, Metropolis is one of my faves.  This is a defendant need to watch.",1395100800,,253,4.02
8269933,5,B0018KKQCS,"I am sure that many Japanese anime fans have enjoyed this film over the past ten years or so.  But, we all know that the DVD didn't do it much justice.  We all know that this film, and all it's detailed, intricate artwork needed to be more defined than the DVD would allow.

Well, the Blu-Ray of this film was never released in the United States, but it is still somewhat available in Japan.  What I mean by ""somewhat available"" is that I think it is no longer being issued, since 2006, so if you can find anyone in Japan that still has it available for sale, I suggest that you jump on it, because it is becoming very scarce. And, of course, it's not gonna be sold cheap.

If you have the DVD of this film, hang on to it, even if you should buy this remastered high definition Blu-ray release.  The Japanese Blu-ray of ""Metropolis""  does not have English dubbing, nor English sub-titles, but if you play your DVD version on your computer or alternative DVD player, in sync with the Blu-ray, you will have captured the whole awesome experience of the High Definition visual of Osamu Tezuka's beautiful anime film of ""Metropolis"".

You just gotta see this high definition Blu-ray on the big screen.  Comparatively speaking, the DVD is so poorly delivered in quality, even if you were to watch it on the small screen TV. This Blu-ray is the official Japanese JASRAC release. Never to be doubted for best quality.

If you need to see an example of this film, check it out on YouTube.",1349481600,6,1480,4.4684014869888475
