I rented as opposed to buying, so for $2 I made a great investment here.  I haven't chosen a company to work with yet, but the information in this video will give me tools going forward with the broker I do sign on with!  Thanks,

Dan Greenwood",1353542400,,385,4.521739130434782

In the same friendly, personable manner you've grown accustomed to in his Youtube videos and Sellinginsite.com, Mario offers advice, tips, and activities you can get started on in your first 30 days as a real estate agent. You only have so much time, and this video will help teach you where to focus your attention to get you on the right track to success. It's a step by step action plan from someone who's been there before. Whether you're just starting off, or your real estate career needs a reboot, you're sure to benefit from this video. This DVD, in addition to the others in this series, complements his book ""The Honest Real Estate Agent"" - well recommended, if you haven't yet read it!",1352851200,,799,4.594405594405594
8539056,5,B009B0STTO,"Mario lets you know what do to be successful in the beginning and what to stay away from. He lets you know that a career in Real Estate is easy to get into and even harder to stay in over time, then proceeds to lay out a 14 point program to follow for success.",1350432000,,260,3.8333333333333335
8539057,5,B009B0STTO,"Earlier this year I made the decision to become a real estate agent. Due to previous experiences in other lines of work and the fact that I have yet to find a job that pays anywhere near what would merit the astronomical cost of my education I am very careful. I am immediately skeptical of anyone who wants me to pay them to enhance my career. When I came across Mario's videos on youtube it was very refreshing. There were no bells and whistles or promises of a program that would make you rich, just a friendly looking man sitting in his home office doling out advice. I am honest and straight forward by nature so I was interested in seeing what Mario was all about. This DVD takes his youtube videos a step further and spells out several fantastic ways to be spending your time during your first 30 days as a real estate agent.... Also, Mario left his office and moved to a fancier studio to produce the dvds. I've got some great ideas from watching the DVD. Even if you have been in the business for more than 30 days it might be a good idea to check this one out to make sure you are on the right track.",1349827200,2,1110,4.215962441314554
