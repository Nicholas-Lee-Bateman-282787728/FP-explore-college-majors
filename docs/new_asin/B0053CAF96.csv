I like to acquire European movies, and this movie I like me very much. It is a good movie, with good music, approaches in a very authentic way the problems of the young men and girls. It is the young men's and girls's classic European movie. It(he,she) approaches the problem of the drug addiction and his(her,your) negative consequences, can use as lesson many young men and for the girls.
Las peliculas europeas me gustan mucho y esta pelicula espaola me ha parecido excelente. Es una buena pelicula, que ciertamente tiene algunas escenas crudas, pero que reflejan la triste realidad que enfrentan muchos jovenes; no deja de tener escenas chuscas y divertidas, donde cumple su fin que es la diversin, por algo fue una pelicula muy taquillera en Espaa; ahora no debemos escandalizarnos por el abordaje que hace el director de la actuacin de los jovenes, ya que el abuso de las drogas es un problema real, lo mismo que el problema de homosexualidad que tambien se aborda y los problemas de desamor en las parejas; a mi me parecio una buena pelicula, porque creo que dentro de lo caotico de las historias, se puede captar un mensaje, esto es ""la busqueda incierta de la felicidad,que puede conducir a los jovenes a los excesos y terminar afectandose asi mismos"". Esta pelicula es bueno verla porque refleja la cultura violenta de nuestro tiempo, claro que no es recomendable para menores.",1257206400,,1493,4.790697674418604
8608506,1,B0053CAF96,"A big box office back in Spain , Mentiras y Gordas is a film great to look at but essentially one that doesn't give you anything to think about . The movie follows the lives of a dozen or so 20-somethings in the clubs and beds of some randon spanish metropolis .

It's biggest weakness is it's poorly written script .  The young stars here are given nothing to work with . Their characters are shockingly one dimensional and situations and feelings are introduced to the viewer without ever been explained or examined ( Marina's new found sexual identity or Carlos' drug problem for example ) .  A bit more time is given to us with Ana De Armas' Carola , a green-eyed beauty who clings to a man  who can't stay faithful  and with Yon Gonzales' Nico , a closeted young guy who is secretely in love with his best friend Toni ( Mario Casas ) . The direction often brings in mind a mtv vid or a perfume add  . Then , there's the abrupt , overdramatic finale which simply feels fake and makes matter even worse . One of the initial translations of the tittle is "" Lies And Fat Girls "" and indeed there is one lady here called Paz ( Miriam Giovanelli ) who after gaining some extra weight , loses her boyfriend and her job . Eventually she hooks up with a clumsy law student who had a thing for her best friend since some time ago . Still , these two characters seem at odds with their oversexed , statuesqe costars and are here only for comic relief purposes . Disturbungly enough , they are the only two characters for whom the movie poster didn't have enough room for .

Leaving this film , i had two thoughts in my mind : one , i should have partyed more when i was in college and two , i should have chosen another movie to rent .",1255910400,3,1729,4.1741741741741745
