8682891,1,B00OA3YM20,I was very disappointed.all the world had one good vignette the overall quality and acting was subpar to what you would expect in a horror anthology movie...I would recommend purchasing one of the old Hammer films horror anthology movies should you want to check out this genre.,1434931200,2,278,4.9361702127659575
8682892,5,B00OA3YM20,"This is a pretty good low-budget horror anthology.  I got it because I am a Jeff Strand fan and wanted to see his story made into film.  Give it a shot, I liked it more than a lot of movies with a similar theme.",1417132800,,211,3.772727272727273
8682893,5,B00OA3YM20,A great mix of classic horror stories. I especially enjoyed the 4th story by Lyddon/Lansdale. Highly recommend it.,1413763200,2,114,5.388888888888889
