5564394,4,B00B999EGC,"A funny, inventive well filmed modern nod towards 80s slashers. A great cast, plenty of gore, some nudity and some impressive direction make this low budget indie seem better and a hell of a lot more enjoyable than most big budget horror. Definitely worth checking out.",1384732800,,269,4.869565217391305
5564395,4,B00B999EGC,"I really like this movie. It was well done, had the 3 b's, boobs, blood and booze. Well done. I bought this movie because I liked the previous movies that this director and his crew made.",1379289600,,187,4.222222222222222
5564396,4,B00B999EGC,Above average indie slasher proves that even with little money you can make a fun and entertaining slasher movie. I recall hearing about this 3 years ago and wondered why it had not surfaced. I'm glad it finally did and it was worth the wait. The cast and crew did an nice job and you can tell they had fun making this one! Other recent indie films worth watching: The Sleeper / Silent Night / Trashology.,1374105600,,405,4.342105263157895
5564397,5,B00B999EGC,"I thought the movie was very good, considering the producers had very little money to put into it.  It still had a very good plot and scary atmosphere.  I commend the actors, directors, and the whole film crew, on a job well done.  If they had more money, this film would have been even greater that it was.  Great job, guys.",1366588800,2,325,4.278688524590164

5564399,4,B00B999EGC,"Being that ""President's Day"" is a micro budget film, with an estimated budget of only $5,000, it was a film that I actually liked.
A true throwback to real horror, this film has all the great elements that make up a low-budget, gory, cheesy horror flick.
With the budget the filmmakers had, I was surprised at how great basically all of the effects were in the movie, mainly because a lot of movies with way bigger budgets attempt to do, but fail badly.
Some of the things that I didn't care for was the acting, but that's just me. It seemed that only a couple of the actors in this film could actually act. A lot of it comes out as some of the crappiest acting I've ever seen, but that's just me. There were a few parts where the dialogue as well as the acting was just really cheesy to me. The kind that makes you wonder if it was intended to be that way, or if they writers/actors really thought it was going to be golden.

So overall I really enjoyed this film, apart from the acting. It has all the elements that belong in a cheesy, low-budget horror film, and everything was put together nicely.",1366070400,4,1101,4.293269230769231
5564400,5,B00B999EGC,"President's Day is a new slasher movie that delivers the gore, t & a, and the laughs. It also has a great mystery. You'll be guessing until the end as to who the killer is. The bodycount is huge. I didn't count myself, but I wouldn't doubt if as many as twenty people were killed in this movie. Just great fun from beginning to end!",1365811200,4,332,4.123076923076923
5564401,5,B00B999EGC,Were to start this movie was the best slasher movie i have seen in the last three years. It brings back the style of the who done it slasher type movie were the killer walks around with a mask on or dressed up as someone else. the plot is simple nothing new the actors did a first rate job with their parts and delivered great performances not the best but great none the less fans of old school slashers will want to check this out.,1365638400,3,433,4.105882352941176
5564402,5,B00B999EGC,"From SMASHORTRASHINDIEFILMMAKING.COM'S REVIEW:

President's Day is a horror/comedy slasher movie that gets it right. The staples of the genre are there: gore, nudity, suspense, and laughs. What sets this apart from so many other slashers is that it is not dumb. The story is clever AND it honestly takes a little detective work on the audience's part to figure out who is the killer. The fun thing of it is that both of these gentlemen made sure the clues were there, but not obvious. The dialog is well-written and seems natural for all involved. And - shocker of shocks - most of the characters are really likable. I wish other writers would take a hint from the makers of this movie that not all characters have got to be unlikable jerkwads.

The acting overall was superb (with the exception of one or two actors that tended to play it too over the top). But what of the blood and gore and sex and nudity? This is a slasher after all? Well, you get it folks. Let me put it to you this way; the Lincoln killer carries an axe. That's not to say that he doesn't get creative with other instruments of death - he does. The audience gets to view dismemberments, decapitations, eye gouging, burns, and a plethora of other inventive kills along the way.

Of the three films I have seen by LaMartina and George, this is by far the most polished and professional of the lot.  Production values are superb when it comes to the sets, locations, props, and costumes. Technically the cinematography, editing, lighting and sound are well done. The writing shines because it is not stupid. Anybody can make a bad slasher film, but it takes skill to write a script that is funny, clever, intelligent, and suspenseful all at the same time. Chris LaMartina and Jimmy George have done just that - again.

RATING: 9 out of 10 school bells. Fun, smart, hip, and clever. If you like low budget horror movies that are well done, you'll love this one.",1360627200,18,1931,4.569364161849711

8564547,5,B00B999EGC,"This movie was smarter than it had any right to be. Outstanding. To find relevant James Polk jokes (alliteration, yay!) and Zombie Taft stuck in a tub! Zombie JFK yelling, ""Not cool!"" after a JFK joke is made! Brilliant! Movie, I think I love you!",1519171200,,247,4.511111111111111

8564549,3,B00B999EGC,"From Brain Damage films. Duh !

Starring : Zombie Abe ,Zombie Teddy,Zombie FDR,Zombie Nixon and Zombie John Wilkes Boothe.

I loved Maniac Cop, Uncle Sam and am making my own First Responder horror flick Firefrighter (c).

So what if you had dumb college brats out in the woods hanging out in the house from Evil Dead ?

The opening to the movie has a scene right out of Valleywoods ALTAR with a creepy Toll Booth guy warning them their lives are in danger.

There is crazy in-jokes like Zombie Taft getting stuck in a bath tub and not able to terrorize,Or Zombie FDR chasing a nearly nude coed in forest and his wheelchair hits a rut and tips over .

There is even a SCREAM reference where the black guy must die and of course he had the only gun on the human side.

Let us not forget the fragile hero bears a resemblance to Bruno Mars..",1498521600,,838,4.2993630573248405
8564550,5,B00B999EGC,Hilarious Indy with endless puns (my girlfriend and I can't stop quoting!). The token black guy and jock are by far my favorite characters. The less popular Presidents make for some great laughs too!,1497225600,,199,4.882352941176471
8564551,3,B00B999EGC,"This movie was pretty strange for a high school teen slasher. The death scenes were weird, except for a few brutal deaths. The acting was OK, especially for an indie film. I have the say, the only thing this film had going for it, was a long list of suspects until each one gets killed off. The Abe Lincoln mask looked pretty cheap also.",1486512000,,337,4.28125
8564552,3,B00B999EGC,This is by no means that great of a movie but I still enjoyed it for what it is and that's low budget slasher garbage. Pretty fun and entertaining at times as the Abe Lincoln slasher roams around and picks off the teens. Enjoyable with a few brews for sure.,1422662400,,257,4.16
8564553,3,B00B999EGC,"I think this movie it is a little bit cheesy on the way the actors act , Slacking on the police they sucked big time !!! I give it 3 stars ... The only thing I think they did pretty good on the movie is when the killer slashed all the students ...., the only thing I don't understand how come a killer strike to kill during the day and the damn school does not have any cops watching at all , the damn principal just talked & talked and does not do his job ... Instead of getting  cops in school during the day & night  to watch the students ...",1405123200,,545,3.857142857142857

8564555,5,B00B999EGC,A lot of effort and a lot of polish went into this indie slasher film and it turned out great. George and LaMartina have done it again with this horror comedy! The extras are a ton of fun too. Check it out and support independent films!,1392076800,,236,4.1521739130434785
