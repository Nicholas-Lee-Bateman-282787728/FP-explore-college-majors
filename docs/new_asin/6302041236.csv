7820242,5,6302041236,"If you've ever been bounced around a bureaucracy like some kind of human pinball, you'll be able to relate to this movie. And since most people have, this movie probably would have a wide audience that it appealed to. See, this film is about bureaucracy - be it communist, capitalist, or otherwise. But make no mistake- it's not a film about communist bureaucracy. It just so happens that it is set in communist Cuba.

The movie is funny in an absurd sort of way, kind of like Luis Buenel's movies. If you like those kinds of movies, this one may be for you.

I gotta say, it's also a bit of a nail biter, but not in the horror movie kind of way. More in the way of ""Well, what's the protagonist going to do now?"" or ""How's he going to get out of this mess?"" That just makes the film better.

The film is also interesting in that it is critical of the bureaucracy in Cuba at that time. You get to see what a self-professed supporter of Castro thought the problems with the Cuban revolution were in the 60s.",1167609600,2,1006,4.2565445026178015
7820243,5,6302041236,"Never-mind post-revolutionary Cuba; right here in America, in 2000, there  is enough bureaucracy for the comedic lessons of Alea's great film about  people's propensity to conform at all costs to absurd restrictions from  'above' and cause misery to others rather than risk the slightest  insecurity to themselves, to be driven home painfully.
""Death of a  Bureaucrat"" is a really funny film but one that makes you think, like  Tati's ""Playtime,"" Fellini's early films and, in particular, some  of Bunuel's more light-hearted comedies like ""Illusion Travels by  Streetcar.""
Alea's film is deeply critical and ridicules everything  that is part and parcel of government enforced socialism. You can't fault  Castro for not having a sense of humor, that's for sure. A film like this  would've been unthinkable in communist Russia. Regular Alea side-kick Leo  Beower's understated fusic-music is, as always, excellent.",969235200,11,914,5.496402877697841
7820244,5,6302041236,"The film is a satire that critices the burocracy and is a propaganda to enhance the comunist system.  The cultural features included, such as men admiring women, and the need to resolve ""resolver"" everything is  very Cuban. One can laugh to death after all the painstaking paperwork that  the sobrino has to go through in order to get the ""carnet del  trabajo"" out of the coffin.",951091200,9,379,4.696969696969697
7820245,4,6302041236,"'Death of a Bureaucrat' stands as testimony to the  indefatigable efforts of Tomas Guitierrez to portray the absurdities of the Cuban bureaucratic system in the early days of the Revolution. Frosty, paper-cluttered  Kremlin-style regulations are adhered to by Latins of latin temprament  under the harsh tropical sun. The protagonist is the anti-hero, resolutely  attempting to comply with the system yet being forever let down by it - his  law-breaking activities are merely to speed up the (re)-burial of his  uncle, (look out for the vultures circling above the house). The film is a  deliberate dig at the politics, yet the saving grace from the censors are  (probably) the fact that his uncle was 'un obrero ejemplar',(a model  workman churning out busts of Cuban hero and symbol of the Revolution Jose  Marti), and that the wayward nephew is, indeed, condemned as a madman.  The opening scene of the uncle's bust-making machine makes the best  of Terry Gilliam's animation for Python look like a poor reproduction. The  other classic moments are the languid, fat, cigar-smoking bureaucrat, and  the epic battle in the cemetry, beginning with the mousy, vindictive  rancour of the vicious cemetry director. A classic.",948240000,12,1222,5.22680412371134
