8005273,5,B00011HJ3E,"If you are studying Jeet Kune Do (or simply want to learn how to take your self defense abilities to the highest level), you MUST get this dvd! I've been a lifelong Bruce Lee fan and have an extensive library of JKD videos/dvds, including those from Dan Inosanto, Jerry Poteet, Ted Wong, Paul Vunak, Ron Balicki, and others. I must say, Patrick Strong's series absolutely trumps all other JKD-related training videos.

Unlike other instructors (many of whom learned under Inosanto), this is not watered down JKD ""concepts"" or any such nonsense. You won't find Filipino martial arts forced in under the guise of JKD, or a hodge podge of whatever the instructor believes Bruce ""might have"" integrated into JKD had he still been with us. No, what you get here is exactly what The Master himself, Bruce, was teaching to his very first students.

Mr. Strong's ability is simply stunning. It is evident that this man has never stopped practicing what he learned from Bruce. In many drills, Mr. Strong seems as fast and powerful as Bruce himself. That is certainly saying something considering that the great Joe Lewis considered Bruce ""the fastest man to stand before him"".

We've always read that Bruce was decades ahead of his time, not only in his martial arts and philosophy, but also in his training methods. After watching some of the drills Bruce personally taught to Mr. Strong, those statements are more evident than ever. I cannot say enough good things about this dvd. I have ordered another in the series and will purchase the final two within the next couple of weeks. The information contained in this dvd will benefit anyone looking to find their personal Jeet Kune Do. I will be referring back to it for all the rest of my training days.",1266451200,2,1747,4.7781456953642385
8005274,5,B00011HJ3E,"Like Jeet Kune Do, I'll keep this review simple and direct. This DVD is  the best I have ever seen. If you study Jeet Kune Do or just interested in self defense get this DVD. If your only interested in self defense, you will want to study JKD after seeing this DVD. I suggest you try Sifu Strongs 4 DVD set. All 4 are JKD at a higher level.
