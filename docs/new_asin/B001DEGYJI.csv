8293038,3,B001DEGYJI,"DO NOT buy this DVD thinking you are getting the entire show the way it was on May 1st 1985 at the Hartford Civic Center.  I was there that night, HBO was recording the show for their concert series, and I've been trying to find an HBO DVD of the show.  This DVD leaves out one of the BEST performances of White Room I've seen Clapton do, and I started seeing him live in 1979 on the Backless tour and the Cream Reunion in 2005.  Picture and sound aren't that bad, and you get a pretty good concert.  One tip-off:  The DVD is 77 minutes long.  Eric Clapton has NEVER played less than two hours anytime I saw him.",1526428800,,612,4.100840336134453

8293042,4,B001DEGYJI,"First, I do not think this DVD is ""official"" in any traditional way. It seems to be one of many ""grey area"" DVDs produced recently in Europe and South America, and sold at gas stations and supermarkets at bargain prices (I paid about 4 bucks for mine, in a batch with other similarly priced DVDs including John Lennon Live In New York City, Cat Stevens Tea For The Tillerman Live and The Rolling Stones Steel Wheels Live In Tokyo).

The DVD is typical 80s fare, a straight transfer from Laserdisc, not mind blowing, somewhat dark, but ultimately very pleasant to watch. The performance is quite professional, and the officially released show from the same era (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eric-Clapton-Friends-Live-1986/dp/B0000C2IUJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eric Clapton & Friends: Live 1986</a>) really pales in comparison. The band is larger here, and the performance is fun! The band is comprised by Marcy Levy and Shaun Murphy on backing vocals and percussion, Tim Renwick on guitar, the legendary Donald Duck Dunn on bass, Jamie Oldaker on drums, and longtime Clapton collaborator Chris Stainton on keyboards, with Eric on strats and lead vocals.

I personally own most of Clapton's official DVDs (my hands-down favorite is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eric-Clapton-Live-in-Hyde-Park/dp/B00005OM5L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eric Clapton - Live in Hyde Park</a>), and hardly ever pull any of those from the shelf any more, considering most of them very sterile, almost boring. Therefore, I was hesitant to get another, and even worse, from my least favorite period of the man. I only surrendered because of the low price. In hindsight, I am so glad I bought it, because it is now one of my favorite Clapton concerts to watch. To compare, in image quality it is no worse than 24 Nights, and the audio, while mono, is surprisingly decent. And the quality of the performance makes up for any shortcomings.

I am watching this again as I write this review, and I am enjoying it enormously. Not hi-fi by any means, but very entertaining. I much prefer to have it than not, for certain. The sequence Badge/Let It Rain is playing now, very nice, quite organic.",1367366400,2,2249,5.456896551724138
8293043,4,B001DEGYJI,"I had been searching to replace my VHS live in '85 for several years before realising this Dvd rip of a Japanese laser disc was available under a differing title. The sound and picture quality are not too flash but better than my well worn video.
The concert is one of my favourites and definitely worth 5 stars but the quality of the recording lets it down, very grainy/difficult to watch on a big screen though the audio cleans up ok on a decent stereo system.",1336608000,5,462,4.383720930232558
8293044,1,B001DEGYJI,"There is a reason this dvd is under 10 bucks. It stinks. Actually my copy was a bootleg copy. If it wasn't so cheap I would have sent it back. I noticed it as soon as I opened it. It is a burned dvd with a light scribe photo on the front of it. It should be removed from amazon. The sound quality sucks and the lighting is dark as if it was cheaply transfered from a vhs. If you are a E.C. fan as I am, there are way better DVD's out there. This one will go on my shelf with the rest of them but it won't get much playing time. BEWARE!",1291593600,11,535,3.7017543859649122

8293046,5,B001DEGYJI,"My husband has practically every Eric Clapton DVD and CD out there.  I purchased this one from South America.  He was excited to receive it because he wanted a DVD with EC singing ""Lay Down Sally.""  He has many CDs which have EC playing that song, but not as a DVD.  That song is our 2 daughters' favorite!",1266364800,3,306,4.224137931034483
