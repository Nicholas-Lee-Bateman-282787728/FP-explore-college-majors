4155673,4,B003MRNLPY,"(special thanks to Film Movement for providing me with a screener!)

Family is one of the few things in our lives we can't choose. You can reinvent yourself in many ways, but your family is something you're stuck with, for better or worse.

In the film Bomber, Ross (Shane Taylor), gets reminded of just how bad the ""worse"" part can be when he's stuck driving his elderly parents from England to a small town in Germany. Precisely why his father (Benjamin Whitrow), wants to go there is a mystery that's not revealed until fairly deep into the film.

Ross is a man who's clearly been hounded by his father his entire life. His dad is definitely one of those men who is never happy with anyone or anything. We never quite find out exactly why, but the trip to Germany offers at least something of an explanation. His mother (Eileen Nicholas), is a pleasant, long-suffering woman who clearly loves her husband and her son, and yet feels very alienated from both, which is no surprise given that neither treats her well.

This is a good movie, but not always an easy one to watch. Both Ross and his father are jerks, both to each other and to Ross' mother, throughout the film. Once Ross finds out why his dad is so keen to be in Germany, he calms down quite a bit. As for his father? He remains largely the same, though in the final scene we get a glimpse of hope for a better future.

== Short Subject ==

This month's short film is the German movie ""Edgar"". It's about an old, retired man whose wife died recently. He feels useless and wants to work. He goes to a department store looking for a job, and then accidentally leaves while holding an umbrella he didn't pay for. He's nabbed by the store security guard who explains that he won't have to worry about jail, but might have to do some court-ordered work. The old man gets a gleam in his eye...

To say more would spoil the movie. Suffice to say I really liked this short! It's intelligent, has a good message and the last scene had me laughing my backside off! Definitely worth seeing.",1286323200,6,2043,4.417553191489362

4155716,1,B003MRNLPY,Completely didn't like it.  The parents are far too ridden with guilt and uncertainty over what to do about the son and his girl-friend troubles.  They should have told him to go home on his own rather than discuss whether to cancel the trip.  Lesson here: don't go on a trip that means something to you with people who are going to make it an agonizing trip.,1454976000,,359,4.3283582089552235

4155719,3,B003MRNLPY,No Emmy's to be had here. Solid performances by good fitting cast. Son get sucked into taking mom & pop on a road trip to Germany. Father has planned this trip most of his life & its now or never. Tight lipped dad and well meaning mom make a cross country adventure with a reluctant son. Satire within a dysfunctional family.

The humor was meh. The acting was very good. The scenery was nice. Then the ending was not satisfying at all, to say the least, and my husband and I were disappointed we bothered to watch this movie.",1452988800,,371,4.904761904761905

4155734,3,B003MRNLPY,A sensitive family drama combined with the road trip from hell makes for a riveting film. Quite gripping.,1447718400,,105,4.888888888888889

4155740,2,B003MRNLPY,"Meh. None of the characters seem terribly likeable. Kind of caricatures without much depth, and the whole thing feels a bit of a stretch as far as credibility/evolution of plot and character development. Really it seems as unbalanced in one direction as the direction away from which the ensemble seems to be trying to draw us. In other words, the young ones are just as out of touch with reality and proper behavior as the oldies they are ostensibly rescuing, albeit in different ways.",1440892800,,486,4.7976190476190474

4155759,2,B003MRNLPY,"I'm sure I could have joined others in saying how great of a movie this is - but I found it disturbing.  That Filmmakers find this type of behavior of the Son as worth watching?  I found it Rude and a sad Slice of how society sees treating a parent or parents like this?  I know my mother drove me a bit crazy, while I was taking care of her - but she had dementia and I was having a hard time understanding the disease and it's affect on her.  And there were times my good nature was provoked.  But THIS was hands down shocking.

My mother taught me to be respectful of people in general - and never would have thought I could give a Thumbs Up to this sort of indecency.

Reminds me more of why kids get guns, and take their anger out

4155762,3,B003MRNLPY,British humor often falls flat for me and though this movie had all of the ingredients to make it funny and poignant - I found it tedious. If you are interested in a wonderful film about a father-son road trip - I highly recommend Nebraska.,1430006400,,240,4.355555555555555
4155763,4,B003MRNLPY,The son drives the elderly father and mom on Dads vacation revisiting a site he accidentally dropped a bomb on during the 2nd world war.

4155764,4,B003MRNLPY,"This was a good movie. Why is it that most of the movies with any thought these days come from somewhere other than the US? The Brits are making good movies.

Basically all that happens in this movie is a son ends up driving his parents on their ""vacation."" That's it. Spoiler! But that's not really important. The movie works because of it's focus on human relationships, be they boyfriend-girlfriend, parent-child, etc. This movie is also about coming to peace with wartime events, but that is more of a secondary theme I feel.

Anyway, worth a watch.",1427846400,,553,4.690721649484536
4155765,5,B003MRNLPY,"Five stars for meeting my expectations. I needed a movie that would make me laugh, and this one accomplished that very well. If you're in the mood for a movie that will make you laugh out loud, this is a terrific choice.

Edit, more than two years later (6/6/2017). I just watched it again because I needed something that would make me laugh out loud. It's a terrific movie: offbeat, funny, and charming, I frankly don't understand the many negative reviews, given that I'm fairly critical of movies, so it's apparently just a matter of taste. But to my mind, it's a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. And I may well watch it again when I need a lift.",1426636800,2,663,4.390243902439025

4155769,5,B003MRNLPY,"Came across this DVD, and because I'm a very particular film watcher, I was hesitant to sit and start watching it unless it was going to be a good movie. Two of the ""user"" reviews on IMDB didn't seem to get the film, but the trailer looked like just my kind of movie. As it turned out, I was delighted by the movie from beginning to end. It is one of those movies where the little details in the editing and the music scoring and the acting are so well done. The best thing about this movie is the performances of the elderly parents. Those are EXPERT actors. They know just what they're doing, from their big moments to the little glances and expressions. The film moves along so briskly and easily, and it ultimately provides two monologues for the elderly husband and the wife characters near the end of the film that allow the two actors to truly demonstrate their expertise in their craft. Watching the extra behind the scenes portion of the DVD revealed that all that precise editing (so well done) and the excellent photography were all accomplished with a micro budget and barely any crew at all (really just four or five people). This film really goes to show how filmmakers who really know what they're doing can do a lot on a very small budget and make it all look so smooth. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Bomber,"" especially the performances of Benjamin Whitrow and Eileen Nicholas. They were both delightful and amazing. The writing is superb, and the story is funny, touching, and easy to take. The script and the acting provide insights into human nature and its emotional potential. Glad I saw it.",1369008000,11,1605,4.576388888888889
4155770,4,B003MRNLPY,"A aging veteran wanting to return to the village he mistakenly bombed in WWII. A silly car accident forces a young 30 something son to drive his parents on a trip from England to Germany.  Believable marital, family, generational and cultural complications.  Suspenseful and humorous.  3-dimensional characters with excellent and subtle acting.  Beautiful photography. The resolution that we need to express our emotions was simplistic and unsatisfying. While the use of the f-word was not gratuitous, it was overused for my taste.",1301356800,4,531,5.439024390243903
4155771,5,B003MRNLPY,"Bomber is suspenseful, funny and very well acted and directed. Beautifully shot, yet very real, you feel like you've just taken an international road-trip. With themes that any adult can relate to, it illustrates the importance of appropriate boundaries, communication, appreciation and family. I highly recommend that you take the time to enjoy it too.",1292112000,,353,5.4363636363636365
4155772,5,B003MRNLPY,"Sometimes the resolution you seek is not the one you thought you'd find when you start out on your journey.  Paul Cotter's engaging and witty film ""Bomber"" invites us to think about the stories people, yes, even family members, carry around inside their heads, without ever telling anyone else about them.  Just as Holocaust survivors have been known to keep their memories in a compartment away from their normal everyday family life, Alistair has kept his own memories of the War in his head and heart for decades.

So he decides to take a roadtrip back to Germany, with his wife Valeri and all-but-useless son, to visit the village he bombed accidentally as a young pilot during the second World War.  He intends to apologize to its inhabitants  for the destruction he caused.  What this actually translates into when he gets there is a scene of him solemnly 'tidying up' some bricks from a bomb-damaged farm building into a neat pile.  It is a profoundly moving moment.  The damage cannot be undone: buildings cannot be magically restored and yet Cotter suggests it is the process of trying that matters.

This theme provides the path to the unexpected resolution of the film.  Relationships in the family that had been entangled by misunderstanding and selfishness at the outset of the journey are gently teased out into a manageable order that makes the road ahead (and Valerie's shoe shop Shangri-La) promise a happier future for the family.  Recognizing the things that he can change in his own family may be the most rewarding thing Alistair can take home with him.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The director handles his subject with a lightness of touch that is refreshing and entertaining.  The superb performances from his cast of actors made me laugh at the absurdities of family life and yet feel connected enough to the characters to hope it all worked out for them in the end.  I will look forward to this director's next project ...",1288742400,2,1954,4.8258258258258255
4155773,4,B003MRNLPY,"""Bomber"" does a great job of reminding you that sometimes the people you think you know the best, you don't really know at all. It takes a somewhat already dysfunctional family - distant father, frustrated mother, conflicted son - and throws them into the one situation that can take its toll on even the closest of families: a cross-country road trip. The film has all the usual road trip elements, from bickering drivers to tourist stops (courtesy of Mom's guidebook - gotta love when she takes a picture of son Ross pointing to a road sign. Whose mother hasn't made them do THAT on a family trip?)to trying to get directions in a country where nobody understands you. But it's the interaction between the family itself and the reason why they're on the trip in the first place (you have to see it to find out - no spoiler here)that really makes this film worth seeing. With just a small cast (three main characters, all brilliantly acted), you might think the story would drag but it doesn't. Driven by a good plot, some quirky situations, unexpected dialogue and excellent camera work (especially if you consider the movie's budget), it's a should-see. Watch it with your kids or your parents; you might be surprised at the reaction...",1288656000,5,1239,4.7407407407407405
