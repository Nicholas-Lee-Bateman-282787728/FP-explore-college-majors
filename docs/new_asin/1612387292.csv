201281,1,1612387292,Only one dvd worked. the other one would not play at all. I had to write to get a refund.,1374796800,,89,3.5
201282,4,1612387292,I enjoyed the DVD but sorry that the BluRay is almost exactly like the DVD.  I think the BluRay or DVD would have been enough.  Didn't want to sit through the same thing again.,1373328000,,176,4.147058823529412
201283,5,1612387292,This is beautiful and well done - Loved it.  It added excitement for my upcoming trip to Ireland.  Even more excited to go now.,1371772800,4,127,4.25
201284,4,1612387292,"Fast service, enjoy the DVD . . .",1411603200,,33,3.25
201285,5,1612387292,An excellent travel documentary from a master of the tour industry.  It makes you want to visit there yourself  Enjoy the film,1400112000,,126,4.681818181818182
201286,5,1612387292,"Friends suggested that we watch these shows that originally aired on PBS.  We love the detail and Rick's sense of what a traveller might best spend time visiting.  The programs are great, and the scope is appropriate for casual visitors.",1394496000,,237,4.9
201287,3,1612387292,DVD skipped or froze up in places. Played it in a Bly Ray and a DVD player. Same result in both.,1392681600,,96,3.619047619047619
201288,5,1612387292,Comprehensive tour and details.  The DVD allowed me to gather a group of friends and generate enough interest in Ireland and Scotland to plan a group tour.  Yea,1389744000,,160,4.678571428571429
201289,1,1612387292,"The DVDS Don't work!
The first disk worked fine, but the second one was BLANK!
Amazon sent me a replacement, and the exact same thing happened.
The first one worked and the second one was again BLANK.
Unfortunately I waited too long to get a refund on the SECOND attempt to buy this set.
Now I'm stuck with unwatchable dvds.
BUYER BEWARE!",1381708800,3,338,4.467741935483871
201290,5,1612387292,Very lovely and informative.  Rick does a super job!  Worth the small amount of money invested. We have already  passed this along to our friends leaving for Ireland and Scotland.,1379721600,,179,4.9
201291,1,1612387292,"The disk is bad.  Neither of my DVD players could find anything on the disk.  In reading Amazon's return policy, to get 1000% of your money back the DVD must still be in its plastic wrap.  How stupid is that?  How would I know the disk is bad without opening it.  Very disappointing. The trip is less than a month away and I was already to sit down with this and plan points of interest.",1379116800,6,387,4.1066666666666665
201292,4,1612387292,I am planning a trip to the UK & Ireland and was very informative in the planning.  I would recommend.,1378512000,,102,4.1
201293,5,1612387292,"We are planning a trip to Ireland and having used Rick Steve's guidebook for previous vacations to Europe, I bought this to help us chart our travel plans. But now, after viewing the video, it seems like we have already been there - so why pay all the expenses? Just kidding, but it will help us make better travel decisions.",1378339200,3,325,4.433333333333334
7800390,2,1612387292,"I hated to give this such a low rating as my husband and I have watched and enjoyed everything we've purchased of Rick Steves.  This particular video we were particularly interested in as we plan to travel to Ireland and Scotland next year.  It's a  2-DVD set; the first disc we could see (could be read by the player).  The second disc (with 5 episodes), our BluRay video player couldn't read. After notifying them, Amazon immediately sent us a replacement. That, too, had the same problem so it was replaced also. The third video had the same issue so Amazon said they would refund us as we'd likely have the same issue. I talked to an Amazon rep who said they would pull the offering until they can be sure the problem has been corrected. Thank you, Amazon, for your attention to your customers.  I'm still hoping I will get to see the Ireland/Scotland DVDs, both of them, one of these days.",1468627200,,894,4.493827160493828
