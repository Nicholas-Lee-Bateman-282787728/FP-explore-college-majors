BRACKKKK!!!!!!!!!!  is about all I can say for it  or YUCK!!!!!!!!!!
I picked it up because it said guest appearance by Gatchaman.....Ya I'm a battle of the Planets fan; so at the price I figured what the heck.....the BOTP bits were stupid!!!!!!!!!!!
Speed Racer driving thru in the Mach 5 wasn't bad but to say this dvd has any remote redeeming qualities there are none that I could see.",1399334400,,515,4.298969072164948
8039893,3,B00067RF0U,"Overall:
If you are a fan of the series you will enjoy it. Otherwise stay away.
(well, if you're reading this review you must have some interest anyway.)
I would give it 4 stars considering how glad I was to find this, but the price is a bit too steep for only 2 episodes.

Detail:
This is a straight import of a 1993 Japanese OVA release ""Time Bokan Oudoufukko"".
The first episode is a car(mecha) race between various incarnations of the 3 bad guys. The 2nd episode's focus is on the trio from Yattaman (read:Doronjo), with various cameos from other animes of Tatsunoko production.

Pros:
You will see your favorite characters from time bokan series.

Cons:
This DVD has only 2 30-minute episodes, and of course these are not original ones.

I wish Time Bokan series received better treatment -- A box set of the original TV series would be nice.
(However, there are hundreds of episodes -- so that's not very likely.)",1121990400,9,919,4.619631901840491
