601156,3,6303212220,"Every decade or so, there's a new film version of ""Alice In Wonderland""; usually with an All-Star Cast. There's Paramount's 1932 version and Disney's misguided 1951 animated version. Their was a British musical version in 1972. This American TV Version from 1985 is one of the oddest, and that's saying something, considering the source material. This passion project from producer Irwin Allen and scripted by playwright Paul Zindel gets extra points for presenting ""Alice In Wonderland"" and its sequel ""Through The Looking Glass"" as two separate stories. Originally broadcast over two nights, this was a 1985 Special Event.
  As Lewis Carroll's Wonderland characters, this version features a grab bag of 1980's ""B"" List and ""C"" List celebrities. Red Buttons, Shelly Winters, Rodney Mcdowell, and Ernest Borgnine were all cast members of Irwin Allen's disaster epic ""The Poseidon Adventure."" There's Scott Baio, John Stamos, Jonathon Winters, Beau Bridges, Jeff Bridges, Anthony Newley, Jayne Meadows, Steve Allen. Martha Raye, Imogene Coca, Sally Strutters, Donna Mills, Sammy Davis, Jr., Pat Morita, Patrick Duffy, Karl Malden,  Ann Jillian, Harvey Korman, husband and wife Steve Lawrence as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and Queen of Celebrity Weirdos Carol Channing as The White Queen.
  Natalie Gregory plays a very American Alice. I'm assuming everything is still meant to be set in the Victorian era because I noticed a photo of Queen Victoria on the wall of Alice's home. Gregory is just too ""cute."" It is like Shirley Temple is playing Alice, except Gregory isn't as multi-talented as Temple. Little Miss Gregory is professional, dutiful even. Given the cast of crazies surrounding her, Alice is still the most sane person around. But it's a good thing Gregory gave up acting while she was still a child.
  The songs by Steve Allen are not particularly memorable. By the time this Mini-Series version is over (running about three hours), it all adds up to an overdose of mid-1980's Wonderland weirdness.",1512864000,,2009,5.278996865203761

601310,3,6303212220,"This was a 1985 TV version of both Alice in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass. At the time it was great because of the great costumes and makeup (inspired, no doubt, by the recent play, Cats). So it was better then than now, now that we're used to such things. It also had a great collection of stars. It also had a pre-Star Wars John Dykstra as the special effects guy.

Unfortunately it also has way too many songs, all of which are unremarkable as  is the choreography.

The script also had problems. There are just too many unintended  instances where ""Child molester! Pedophiliac!"" screams out at you. My 12 & 17 year olds were laughing their heads off on just this point. Aside from the unintended humor (Telly Savalas leering at Alice, or an adult Sammy Davis kissing a little girl on the lips, for instance), they didn't like it at all. This is strictly for very young kids.",1482019200,,887,4.490683229813665

601312,5,6303212220,"Alice in Wonderland (CBS, 1985-tvm). Running Time: 3 hours, 03 mins.
Directed by Harry Harris.  Originally shown in two parts, both ""Alice"" stories are here.

Based upon the books by Lewis Carroll (pen name), Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There (1871).
His real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898).

Alice (Natalie Gregory) is 7 1/2 years old. She is setting the table for her mother (Sheila Allen) whom is having guests over for tea. Alice wants to have tea too, but her mother says to her politely that tea is for grown-ups. Alice asks when she will be grown-up. Her mother tells her to be patient. Tea time will come soon enough. Her mother asks her to go outside. Alice walks over the rock bridge under the creek. She sits with her sister (Sharee Gregory) whom is trying to read her book.
  As Alice loves her white cat, she sees a White Rabbit (Red Buttons) in a hurry and she runs after it. He leads her to a wide opening in the rocks. As Alice catches up, she goes through the cave opening and falls into an unseen giant hole, falling very far down. She lands on a thick pile of leaves. She continues to chase after the rabbit through a tunnel. She comes across a curious door and then another door. Then a room full of 10 doors. Ultimately, this leads her to Wonderland.

Also in the All-Star cast: Shelly Winters, Donald O'Connor, Sherman Hemsley, Scott Baio, Sammy Davis Jr, Martha Raye, Imogene Coca, Telly Savalas, Anthony Newley, Roddy McDowall, Arte Johnson, Jayne Meadows, Robert Marley, George Savalas, Sid Caesar, Ringo Starr, Ann Jillian, Carol Channing, Ann Jillian, Harvey Korman, Jack Warden, Sally Struthers, Donna Mills, Pat Morita, Steve Allen, Patrick Duffy, Merv Griffin, George Gobel, Eydie Gorme, Steve Lawrence, Karl Malden, Louis Nye, Jonathan Winters, John Stamos, Ernest Borgnine, Beau Bridges, Lloyd Bridges.

Filmed at MGM Studios, Culver City, California on the same two stages as The Wizard Of Oz (1939) was filmed. Also filmed in Pasadena, California, San Marino, California, North of Malibu, California.

TV-miniseries in English. Option of subtitles in French.

Steve Allen wrote most of the music and lyrics.  Ann Jillian sings ""Emotions"".

Delightful telling of the two stories of Alice in Wonderland. There is nothing objectionable in this television version and is entertaining for the entire family to watch.  Perfect, heart-warming ending.

Seriously...we are not allowed to watch anything else...she is obsessed! I mean...she plays and does other stuff while it's on too...but she doesn't want anything else to be on the tv...just Alice. I have to admit...I am glad THIS was the movie that she decided to obsess about. Because it's 3 hours long that means the MOST we watch it is twice a day. The music is entertaining enough...nothing annoying...and easy to block out. I loved this when I was little but I am honestly quite surprised that my daughter likes it as much as she does.

My memory from childhood wasn't so great, and I asked my mom... ""What was that Alice movie with the big scary monster and the singing? With the real people? Not cartoons?"" I googled, ""Live action Alice in Wonderland"" and I bought almost every DVD I ever see labelled ""Alice in Wonderland"" and I would pop in the DVD and be disappointed. When I finally happened upon this version while browsing on Amazon I recognized the little girl right away from my memories!

601689,3,6303212220,"Alice in Wonderland, 1985 film

This is based on the 19th century story by Lewis Carroll. It begins at a large house. Little Alice helps her mother set the table for tea, then goes outside. When will she grow up? A White Rabbit appears and runs into a cave. Alice follows and falls! She opens doors and enters an empty room. She tastes a bottle and shrinks! Then she eats a cake and grows. Her tears run like rain. Strange creatures follow in the stream. Alice wanders, the White Rabbit asks her to get his fan and gloves; she enters a small house. A bottle makes her grow again! Some cakes are thrown through the window, she changes to her previous size. She sees a caterpillar on a mushroom who is smoking a pipe. Then he disappears! Alice enters a house. Two women act strange.

This world is not a paradise. Alice runs out with the baby, who turns into a pig! She asks the Cheshire Cat for directions home. Then he disappears. Alice finds the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and a Dormouse. After this she continues her journey. Alice sings to a fawn. She enters a door and finds a garden. The people walk down the stairs, the King and Queen arrive. The Queen is excitable. Can Alice play croquet? The Queen always wins! The Cheshire Cat reappears. Grovel on the gravel says the Queen to the Duchess. Next she finds a Gryphon, then a Mock Turtle. Nothing he says makes sense. There is a dance on the grass. Then the trial begins. The witnesses testify. [Is this funny? Satirical?] Suddenly Alice grows up to free the Knave. Off with her head! Alice runs away, then falls asleep.

When she awakes she is back at home. But she is on the other side of the mirror! She finds the book Jabberwocky and reads it. There is thunder and lightning, and a monster lizard appears in her home! To Be Continued. Then the credits roll to list the characters and the players in this movie. Part Two lists the actors and their characters. The story resumes with that scary monster, who just disappears. The chess pieces are alive! The Owl explains life behind the Looking Glass. Flowers talk to Alice. She meets the Red Queen. How can she get home? She boards a train to travel. When it stops she gets off. She meets Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Next the Walrus and the Carpenter. After she meets the White Queen she turns into a sheep. A giant vulture chases Alice.

Next she meets Humpty Dumpty; they talk. The Jabberwocky appears to chase Alice! She escapes. She meets the White King. The Lion and the Unicorn fight for the crown. Can Alice cut the cake? There is a drumming noise, two knights approach to do battle. The White Knight leads Alice away towards home. She gets a crown and scepter! The Red and White Queens show up and talk to Alice. Alice goes to the house with her name on it. It has a giant hall with a banquet table. The characters encountered earlier show up. But Alice just wants to go home. There is a shocking surprise when she opens a present! Can the White Knight save Alice? Alice passes through the Looking Glass and returns home. Where have you been? She is grown up now and can join the adults for tea. The story ends and the credits roll.

I suspect some of these characters were parodies of people in mid-nineteenth century England; they are not relevant today. I never read these stories as a child and never will as an adult. Is this a movie for children or adults?",1439856000,,3379,4.434782608695652

I get the feeling that's the way it is for a lot of the five star reviewers who are excited about finding this slice o' childhood.  This is THE Alice in Wonderland for me, the way the Aileen Quinn/Carol Burnett/Bernadette Peters version of Annie is THE Annie for me.  If you grew up with the VHS taped from TV version and loved it you definitely want this DVD, although I do miss the commercials from the taped version.

If you've never seen it you can find clips on Youtube to see if you'd like it, although the picture quality on the DVD is, of course, way better.

It was, and probably always will be my favorite version of Alice in Wonderland. It's more authentic to the book, and it does have ""big name"" actors in it if that is important to you.  I suppose it would be considered a musical as there is quite a bit of singing.  It is just awesome.  I was thrilled to get it on DVD.  I consider this a treasure.",1431993600,,500,3.8627450980392157
601793,1,6303212220,"I remember hearing some publicity for this 1985 mini-series version of Alice in Wonderland way back then and thinking it might be pretty cool to watch.  I wasn't able to see it then and finally just sat down to watch it.  Maybe I would have a better opinion of it had I watched it as a kid, but watching it for the first time as an adult was a painful experience.

In this three hour mini-series (originally four hours with commercials, I'm sure) we get both Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass.  The first half starts out fairly familiar as Alice (Natalie Gregory) follows the White Rabbit (Red Buttons) down the rabbit hole to Wonderland.  As she searches for the way home, she meets the Caterpillar (Sammy Davis, Jr.), the Mad Hatter (Anthony Newley), and the Queen of Hearts (Jayne Meadows).  As the original story ends, Alice wakes up...to find herself in Mirrorland.  Her only way back is to reach the eighth square in a game of chess.  Along this new trip, she meets the Red and White Queens (Ann Jillian and Carol Cummings) and Humpty-Dumpty (Jonathan Winters).  Will she ever get back?

The adaptors attempted to give the movie some new plot points as Alice wants to go home as well as be seen as enough of a grown up to have tea.  The second part introduces the Jabberwocky, who isn't just a poem but a monster whom Alice must stop running from and face to be a grown up.  Um...where were the serious life lessons in the books?  They were just supposed to be fun adventures.  And, frankly, the Jabberwocky scenes could scare the only audience who might enjoy the film, young kids, especially the climax where it chases all the characters around a castle for much longer than necessary.

This really did have an all star cast.  In addition to those I've named, we've got the likes of Scott Baio, Sherman Hemsley, Sid Caesar, and John Stamos.  With this cast, I expected the acting to be outstanding.  Honestly, it's only mediocre at best.  At times, I felt like they were trying too hard, others not nearly enough.

I do blame some of this on the writing.  Having reread the books in the last few months, I can say with confidence that they left some of the best bits out.  Maybe if the actors had been given the full material to work with, they could have gotten into their performances.

1985 wasn't a great time for TV special effects, and that shows in the visuals.  They are adequate to get the point across, but they certainly aren't going to impress anyone.  The costumes the cast wears are a little better even if they do look like expensive Halloween costumes.

And have I mentioned that this is a musical with songs written by Steve Allen?  Probably because the songs are so forgettable and completely interchangeable.  Seriously, after two or three, I thought I was listening to the same song I already heard only to realize I hadn't heard that song before.  Honestly, when the characters started to sing, I would tune out or fast forward.  The chorography looked like something from an elementary school production.  The only exception was the ""Father Brown"" song that allowed Sammy David, Jr. to entertain with some good tap dancing.

This version of Alice in Wonderland managed to suck all the fun out of these classic books.  Don't waste three hours here.  Read the books instead.",1430524800,,3318,4.625

(Well, movies plural, technically.) Although I prefer to think of the character of Alice as having brown hair like the real Alice Liddell did--as well as American McGee's mature, macabre Alice also does--I do like Natalie Gregory's version too. She's a sweet, likeable girl, but can be a bit brash at times--like any child, really. My god, the cast in here! I don't even know who all of them are, but for the ones I recognize, there's quite a lot! Red Buttons as the White Rabbit is a perfect fit, I think.

The only thing is this is a two part movie through the looking glass is also on the same DVD but it does no say that. I just think people who sell this should clarify that to the customers who buy it other wise they won't know there is two parts on this one DVD.

602011,5,6303212220,So excited to finally find this version of Alice in Wonderland.  Watched it and it's just as I remember.  My 13 and 14 year old daughters also watched it and believe it to be the best version they have seen. Their only complaint was the costumes almost 30 years ago aren't as convincing as now.

602013,5,6303212220,Was so glad to be able to find this Alice because I loved it when I was little and now can share with my kids. They love the songs and the monster.lol,1405123200,,150,3.71875
602014,1,6303212220,"Let me begin by saying I love Alice.  I've read both books multiple times and seen many film adaptations, and this is the first one I've found to be utterly unwatchable.  I love musicals and got so excited with such billing as Ringo Starr, Donald O'Connor, Sammy Davis, Jr, and Telly Savalas.  With a cast that great, how could it possibly be bad?  Oh, I was so wrong.  The songs were terrible and felt forced as they had one for EVERY SINGLE SCENE.  The costuming was bad and the make-up was just creepy.  You could clearly see Natalie Gregory's dark hair under her plastic wig.  Overall, it lacked the charm that should be present in an Alice movie.  The characters were not mad enough, nor were they annoying enough.  It felt like everyone she met was just trying to teach her some stupid lesson that felt as forced as the music.  Sammy Davis, Jr.'s Father William was the only decent sequence in the whole movie.  I liked Natalie Gregory as Alice, but she could have done nothing to save this sinking ship.
I did not grow up watching this, as many people who love it seem to have.  My husband, however, watched it over and over as a kid.  Upon seeing it again he found it as awful as I did.  We could not get past the Queen of Heart's terrible, terrible song.
If you want a good live action adaption, I recommend the 1933 version.  It also has a fantastic all-star cast, and follows the book quite well.  If you want something more trippy, the 1966 version is rather dark and surreal.  Tim Burton's 2010 adaption, which is really more of a sequel to the books, is lovely and charming in that dark Burtonesque way.  And of course nothing can top Disney's 1951 animated version.  Even the 9 minute 1903 version is highly superior to this dreck, as is the short feature from 1915.  I just wish I could watch those enough times to get the taste of this one out of my mouth.",1404691200,,1873,4.371014492753623

602138,4,6303212220,"No, this is not a Tim Burtons 3D re-telling of a Lewis Carroll classic. This is a 1985 two-part made-for-TV film (first part Alice in Wonderland; second part Through the Looking-Glass) featuring Alice and other famous characters played by actors wearing costumes.

This means that the White Rabbit is neither CGI-created nor animatronic. It is played by Red Buttons in heavy makeup, hopping around in a rabbit suit. Because this is also a musical, there are many musical sequences in which players like Sammy Davis Jr. (as the Caterpillar) and Ringo Starr (as the Mock Turtle) dance and sing. What else do you want?

Yes, the film is old-fashioned, and sometimes looks silly or even weird (see how four human-sized oysters dancing in the beach!), but still there is something curiously attractive about the 187-minute version, partly because of its colorful costumes and the names of the stars involved (the film is produced by Irwin Allen, known for his works as director and producer of the 1970s all-star disaster movies such as The Towering Inferno and Poseidon Adventure).

Interestingly, story-wise this Lewis Carroll rendition is surprisingly faithful to the source material, except the endings of both parts. The first part (Alice in Wonderland) has an interesting ending that works as a bridge to the second Through the Looking-Glass part.

I think some viewers may not be impressed with this version. The special effects are rather cheesy (Jabberwocky looks like a huge stuffed toy). Still, I like this old-school fantasy film for all (or perhaps because of) the obvious flaws. And Natalie Gregory as Alice is convincing and adorable.",1388534400,,1644,5.123134328358209

This version, with it's theater like nature and lack of fancy digital enhancements and effects, instills an appreciation and love for traditional children s stories and the essence of drama in children of today. Children are actually quite fascinated by pro grammes 'their parents and teachers' watched as children. I used particular scene from the dvd to explain to my budding chess players that Alice begins her adventures as a 'pawn' in Wonderland and can only return home when she makes it to the eighth square and becomes a queen.

So I say, ""Yay.""  We need more innocence for our kids - more silliness - more nonsense (to quote Ringo). And thanks for having this available on dvd.

I didn't play!

It sticks more closely to Carroll than any other movie versions.
The actors - and they are all great cameos - could not be better.
The music by Steve Allen is wonderful, but would be even better if he used Carroll's text instead of innocuous words by someone else.

602515,3,6303212220,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 1985 production of Alice in Wonderland...
A fitting subtitle for this noteworthy installment of the ""Alice"" story might well be: ""This is Alice in Wonderland... This is Alice in Wonderland on American TV"".

First, this production stands out as one of the few that present a full blown rendition of both the ""Alice in Wonderland"" book as well as the sequel, ""Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There"". Merely presenting Through the Looking Glass is itself unusual. What you often see is a few elements of Looking Glass grafted into a telling of the primary Alice in Wonderland tale. Here though the producers take on both books in a two-part made for TV musical special. Nearly every scene from both books has been rendered (the only other production I've seen where both stories are given a full treatment is the 1983 play:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lewis-Carroll-s-Alice-in-Wonderland-Broadway-Theatre-Archive/dp/B00005QBZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland (Broadway Theatre Archive)</a>), the 1981-82 Russian cartoon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-wonderland/dp/B002PU3GHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in wonderland</a>), and the offbeat Japanese anime (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miyuki-Chan-in-Wonderland/dp/B0000639E5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miyuki-Chan in Wonderland</a>).

So, does that mean that this production is a standard by which other editions of Alice in Wonderland can be measured? No. Not at all. As I chronologically view Alice films from 1903 forward it becomes apparent that there are ""adaptations"" of the story, which attempt to bring the spirit of Lewis Carroll's writings into visual medium... but there are also the ""interpretations"" of Carroll's works that although they maintain the basic story elements, they bring those elements to life in a manner quite different from how they were presented in the books. It seems that many of the American made-for-TV versions of Alice in Wonderland fall into the latter category, as the story is often dumbed down, fluffed up, and embellished upon... all to make the story palatable to the average TV viewing family. Such productions have been 'TVised', if you will.

Which is fine. But such a distinction must be made in reviewing/describing the film to others. As you can see from other reviews this rendition of the Alice story, which stars 10 year old Natalie Gregory, is beloved by many. It's endearing, fun-filled, and entertaining. But it's not really Alice in Wonderland. The show has a bit of a split personality actually. It follows the books so closely at times, and then suddenly careens completely off the tracks. For example, little Alice reads a portion of the Jabberwocky poem out loud in exact cadence to the book, but then the Jabberwocky monster itself is actually injected into the story and randomly appears and chases everyone around for a bit (we will see this again of course in Tim Burton's 2010 version). This Jabberwocky even attacks Humpty Dumpty though and knocks him off the wall. Entertaining perhaps, but not the book. In other cases characters are introduced that did not appear in either book. And since this is a musical, various song and dance numbers have been introduced. They are fun, but except for the rendering of the poems from the book in musical form, the add-on numbers in no way carry the spirit of Carroll's writings.

Even within the TVisation realm of the of the Alice story this production moves away from the book far more than productions of the same ilk. In this Alice the Lewis Carroll characters are driven by 'star power'. Easily recognizable famous faces portray their version of a character. Instead of for example, Ringo Starr playing the Mock Turtle, it's Ringo Starr doing 'Ringo Starr plays the Mock Turtle'. It's Telly Savalas doing ""Telly Savalas plays the Cheshire Cat"". It's Sammy Davis Jr. doing his take on the Caterpillar. It's light-hearted musical fun for sure, but if you happen to be interested in a more sober adaptation of the books, I would steer you to a 1972 British version with Fiona Fullerton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-s-Adventures-in-Wonderland/dp/B0003JAOFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>). The film has a cast of likewise famous British actors/comedians, but here you will see what it means to *become* the character. The actors are virtually unrecognizable. The production also has musical numbers, but they are choreographed in a far less saccharine manner.

There is also a notable version of just the 'Looking Glass' story that is very well presented. Check out the 1998 rendition with Kate Beckinsale (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-Through-the-Looking-Glass/dp/B0006FO9C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice Through the Looking Glass</a>).

But again, this telling of Alice with Natalie Gregory has its moments, and kids will likely love it. The special effects are marvelous for their time. Just be aware that you are viewing an altered and somewhat sanitized version of the books. Also, it's best to temper your expectations regarding the ending. I won't reveal what happens, but it's best to keep your expectations somewhat low.

PS - I'm now about halfway through my list of Alice's to view and review. Something is different. I think I may be turning in to something of a Lewis Carroll ""snob"". I'm changing. I'm not who I was when I started this adventure. Someone pass me a tart!

My favorite part is when the White Rabbit throws pebbles at Alice and they all turn into the most delicious looking cakes. I've always compared the other Alice in Wonderland movies to this one based on what the 'Eat Me' 'Drink Me' props looked liked. And nothing compares to them, they can never get them right. But this movie did along with everything else.

The only thing I would caution about is the Jabberwocky scene. I believe it appears three times throughout the movie. It has the potential to frighten a little kid, but there's a great message in the end.",1337731200,,852,4.490322580645161

The thing is, some parts were interesting, but the movie did not make you feel good or like you wanted to watch more...but you had to watch more, because the movie is loooooong. It was like a musical and the music sucked. I don't like musicals but I could deal with one if the movie had some charm or something. I don't know. I bought this movie because it was alice in wonderland and had such great reviews...WHY???!! I'm sorry if I offended anybody's childhood love, but seriously, this movie is really not very good. To me, it's boring, and long, and cheesey, and somehow kindof depressing too. I even watched it with my little brothers...both hated it. So it's not for children or ADULTS.

602606,5,6303212220,"I love this movie.  My brother and sister and I watched it so much our VHS tape wore out, lol.  So glad it's now on DVD!",1305158400,,120,3.576923076923077
602607,4,6303212220,"The late Irwin Allen(""The Master of Disaster"") produced this Alice in Wonderland TV movie in 1985. This budget DVD does justice to the film. It has Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass as they were originally broadcast on television. The VHS versions were slightly re-edited so they could be sold as two separate movies! These two TV movies were based on Lewis Carroll's Alice books. They do a good job telling the story with hard, tangible special effects. Computer Generated Imagery is common in movie making today. There's some visual effects crafted by John Dykstra, as well. Alice in Wonderland does have some campy humor and corny songs written by the late Steve Allen(who also makes a brief appearance in part two). Telly Savalas declares, ""Meow, baby!"" in one scene! The scenes where Alice is chased by a dragon are suspenseful! Keep in mind this Alice TV movie is over three hours long! It'll leave you with a sore rear end!
 Irwin Allen favored ""star power"" and this TV movie has A-list celebrities(Sammy Davis Jr., Jayne Meadows, Pat Morita, Shelley Winters, Lloyd Bridges, etc.) playing mice and rabbits! Let's not forget about Natalie Gregory who plays Alice. She's one of the most adorable flesh-and-blood versions of Lewis Carroll's Alice. She's sweeter than an apple pie and candy bars! Her earnest, sincere performance helps the film. The producers changed Alice's nationality from English to American; Gregory is as American as apple pie! This Alice in Wonderland TV movie is nostalgic fun. It reminds me of watching it during Christmas Vacation of 1985.",1297036800,2,1591,5.026515151515151

602664,3,6303212220,"I remember watching this version of ""Alice"" back in December of 1985 and feeling about the same way about it as I do now. Irwin Allen had the very best of intentions, but the only real saving grace of this made for TV film is the galaxy of stars who parade in and out. Otherwise it's a dumbed down, Americanized retelling of one of the greatest and most flawless children's books to date.",1282003200,,388,4.328767123287672
602665,5,6303212220,"This movie is truly a classic. It gave me wonderful memories as a child and will do the same for my children. My daughter who is 2 1/2 already is amazed at the Jabberwocky. She's not scare of anything, apparently, because that part scared the crap out of me when I was young! But, all the characters in all their costumes is what makes this movie stand out. So many memorable songs and lines, I love it!",1281139200,,403,4.246753246753247
602666,5,6303212220,"I know that as a twelve-year old, when I saw this on TV in 1985, I really liked it. It was never on as frequently as the
animated version was, but there was a time later on it appeared again. My mother laughed and laughed until she just hurt.
She liked this version as well. This one is the one that brings back the memories, for my mother is no longer alive now.
Since the last time I watched this film with my mother, until last year, when we purchased this, I had nearly forgotten
about it. Now with a small family of my own, it is all the more special to me. (My daughter views this one nearly three
times per week.) This is still one of the best Alice films to see.

Alice is the right age and size. So far this area is failing in other versions, excluding the animated one. It stays really
close to the book. The characters are interesting and fascinating, even after all of the years that elapsed in between seeing it last, until owning it on dvd. Nearly everything is following the book. All of the characters are here. A lot of the poems
are included as songs, which is not bothersome to me, because this is one of the first Alice films I recall viewing. I have
to remind myself, that this film is in the 1980's, and for that time I feel that a lot of attention was given to the details.
The poem ""Jabberwocky"" was given by Alice in part, and then the ""Jabberwock with eyes of flame"" appeared and ""burbled as it
came."" Many other such events are here as well. A must for those with children or if you remember this one from the past.
From beginning to ending it is great.",1279843200,,1580,4.180327868852459

602670,4,6303212220,"If you liked Irwin Allen stuff like lost in space, you should love this version
of Alice in Wonderland. What we have here is a nice little tale, without cgi, as
all actors are dressed up for their characters. The big big bonus for this movie
is that we have a boatload of actors/actresses from the tv land of the 80's doing
one role or another.  Its like seeing your friends again...even if most of them
are now gone.
  This movie is split into 2 parts...so after the end credits of the first part,
just wait and the second part will eventually start.

  Once again, i really loved this movie cause it has lots of memories and it was
great to see Telly Savalas as the C. Cat.  I do miss his smile and acting.

602735,4,6303212220,"I bought this movie because my brother and I were remembering it from our childhood. We had recorded it off of the TV when it originally aired. We loved it and wanted our kids to have a chance to see it, too. The songs are great and you'll love picking out all the old celebrities like Ringo Starr, Sammy Davis, Jr. and many more. Keep in mind that it was made for TV so the screen goes black whenever there is supposed to be a commercial break and it aired in two nights so the opening and closing credits run twice. It includes Alice in Wonderland (pt. 1) and Through the Looking Glass (pt. 2). The special effects were great in 1985, though a little cheesy to watch as an adult 25 years later. The Jabberwocky (who appears periodically in the second half) may still frighten young sensitive children. Over all it was a great movie and my 5yr. old son liked it enough that he wanted his other cousins to have a chance to see it, too.",1271116800,,935,4.258426966292135
602736,4,6303212220,"Okay, so maybe this version of Alice doesn't have the highest production quality in the world since it's made for TV, but I'm sure it has the most star power.  Every other character in the movie is a person I've seen before.  ""Hey, it's that guy from Full House!""  ""Hey, it's the grandpa from Problem Child!""  ""Whoa!  That dude was in Blazing Saddles!""  ""What the heck?  Ringo Starr??""  I hadn't seen the Red Queen before, but the lady that plays her is simply gorgeous.  I couldn't take my eyes off her.

Some of the costumes are quite excellent.  I like the White Rabbit one, but the Jabberwock is by far the best.  They had to give the monster extra screen time because his costume's so good.  Cheap, but good.  I've seen it featured on some youtube videos.  Personally, the oyster costumes creep me out the most.  The worst costume you'll see is probably Alice's actually.  That orange is just too much to look at for three solid hours.  Don't watch both parts in one sitting.  You'll be there forever.

I haven't seen the new Alice movie from Tim Burton, so the 1951 animated Disney version is still my favorite.  I like the one where Martin Short plays the Mad Hatter too.  The effects in that one are a bit more flashy.",1271030400,,1226,4.452488687782806

602797,5,6303212220,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

This 1985 television production stands as one of the finest filmed adaptations of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland.""  With an elaborate production design for its time, it endures very well stylistically today.

Featuring actors ranging in diversity from Anthony Newley as The Mad Hatter, to Sammy Davis, Jr. as The Caterpillar and Red Buttons as The White Rabbit, it overcomes an admittedly episodic tendency to massage a core theme.  At the center of Alice's journey through this fantastic landscape is the need for her to accept the reality of growing up.  To the best of my knowledge, this is one of the only ""Alice in Wonderland"" films to state this theme so bluntly.  This gives the movie a firm thematic tone which soldifies what is too often a murky understatement in other films of this story.

Unfortunately, the young girl who plays Alice, Natalie Gregory, tends to be swallowed up by the tremendous talents and personalities around her.  Still, she is very cute with a natural goodness and charm to her performance which compensates greatly for her technical acting shortcomings.

Also featuring a surprisingly strong musical score, this 1985 television production is often unjustly overlooked but is a solid film which outweighs many lesser ones of the classic story.",1264464000,,1300,5.123222748815166

It gives a great spread of stars (if you remember them), and entertaining songs.  The special effects are from the 80's so it's very funny to watch now. This is another one of those things that you're either a die hard fan of, or not.  I don't think adults would really be into it if you hadn't seen it as a child.",1261353600,,644,3.885496183206107

If you can still remember the words to the songs and the quotes from the characters still today from a movie you watched in 1985, then who can say this movie in anything but great! Of course it is low budget from the 80's but they don't make movies like this anymore. Maybe the low budget is what challenged them to take it to the next level of imagination.

602916,5,6303212220,"I was four years old when this movie first came out and now, at the age of 28, I still remember it. Bits and pieces of it would pop into my head and it would drive me crazy trying to remember exactly what it was that I was remembering. The Looking Glass cake (I remembered it as being the gray colored cake that cut itself), the Jabberwoky (the big lizard that chased the little girl), the chess pieces...I looked it all up on YouTube and searched Amazon when I realized that what I was remembering was a version of Alice in Wonderland. When I found it, my first thought was, ""I was four when I last watched that and I still remember it?!""

My brother who is about a year older than I am now has three kids and my eldest brother who is 35 has one also. These kids will literally watch the same movie over and over until everyone else is so sick of seeing and hearing it that we could all puke ourselves to death just so that we wouldn't have to be subjected to having to watch that same movie yet again. So, I thought that since I liked this one so much when I was little, maybe it would give them something else to wear out for a little while. Unfortunately, I don't think that their attention spans are quite three hours in length yet. But that's ok. I still enjoy watching this one myself ;)",1248220800,,1294,4.155378486055777

I wasn't sure how they would receive it, considering the age of the movie and the fact that it wasn't a cartoon, but they LOVED it too!

I cannot warm to Irwin Allen's production of ""Alice"" despite the very good performance of Natalie Gregory, the movie never really gets off the ground.  The various stars are not at their best in their roles and actually seem miscast in many instances.  I am inclined to blame the director as the comedians and actors all are talented individuals apparently not allowed to actually get into their characters.  And the songs penned by Steve Allen are mediocre at best and embarrassing at worst. A shame and a waste.  My advice, read the book and let your imagination do the rest.  Lewis Carroll does not need Irwin Allen and neither do you.",1239580800,,775,4.613138686131387

602947,3,6303212220,"Don't be fooled by the sellers on ebay promoting the repackage of this video for $21.00 - $30.00.  This DVD does contain BOTH episodes of Wonderland and Looking Glass.  (Took me foreeeever to find that out!  Make sure you see a photo of the two Chess Queens on the back.)  You will get a nice deal here on Amazon!  This is a cute video with lots of performances by several old/dead has-beens/unremembered.  Natalie Gregory is darling!  I think she is talented, and could have been coached to talk with a little bit of an English accent. I also enjoy the scenes with the two Queens, especially Carole Channing as the White Queen.  I think I like Looking Glass part more, with it's vivid imagery and kooky characters (yet the version with Kate Beckinsale, for me, is more dramatic and powerful).  The problem with this DVD is that it's dated, and extremely looooong!  Unlike the Wizard of Oz, the songs aren't that great and the scenery often looks the same. The actors looked like they were straining in their animal costumes.  Kids can only connect to Alice up to a point. It can be boring to kids if they don't take a few breaks, especially after the first part.  It consists of performances that can be fun; however I almost felt bad for Natalie Gregory at times.  The directing is redundant and it seems as if the girl is a captive audience to the other characters. In some ways, this film makes adults like self-absorbed jerks.  So when they are singing to Alice at the end, you have to wonder - why?  It is cute for its time.  I believe Tim Burton is working on a version of Alice in Wonderland (with Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter).",1229990400,14,1637,4.461279461279461

I have seen many more ""Alice in Wonderland"" movies since, but I don't recall any of them to have that dragon or being stuck on the wrong side of the mirror thing like this one does. In my eyes, this is the only REAL ""Alice in Wonderland"" movie for me, probably because it was the first one I saw and me and my best childhood friend played games about it.  No other Alice in Wonderland have been able to come instead of this one, even though they are also good, this is the nostalgia.

603169,5,6303212220,"80S CHILDREN STAND UP!!!  I used to watch this tv movie with my little sister when I was about 5 or 6 years old back in 85'.  It quickly became my favorite movie EVER!  Never have I seen a better theatrical version ever done of this fantastic story.  This version, cancels out ANY other version before or after it!  I advise anybody who hasn't seen this version to skip the rest and watch this one.  The movie sets were excellent.  The visual effects were great for the mid 80s.  I loved the songs, not to mention, an all star cast.

I hadn't seen this movie for about 10 years since tv didn't play it anymore, until the disney channel played it.  I looked for it in the library and even searched 2 movie guides there.  Neither of the different brands, even listed it.  BOTH books were the thickness of phone books.  In the late 90s I finally stumbled on it at blockbuster video.  But to my dismay, it was rented out and never returned.  Whats worst, was that they couldn't reorder it because it was out of print.

I FINALLY found my #1 movie on amazon on my family's computer.  I ordered the vhs box set and soft case for Through the Looking Glass in 2003.  I watched it over and over and vividly remembered most of its content.  I even took it with Me on my first trip to california that year, and actually watched it there!

Sadly, I had a fire because of hurricane wilma and it burned up in 2005.  I came back to amazon and it is twice the price it was when I bought it.  I didn't mind that it was only available on vhs  since it added to the 80s feel, even though I wanted it on dvd.  Well...now its here!  It also has both parts on the dvd.  So I don't have to buy it on vhs again.  The movie is brilliant!  Cop it!",1172275200,,1721,4.117824773413897

When it originally aired in 1985, mind you. It had been, probably, 15 years or more since I had seen it and I was surprised at how much of the songs and scenes that I remembered. Probably the best version of Alice In Wonderland I have ever seen. Definately better than the late '90s version with Tina Majorino.

What great movie.

Caution this movie was produced before TV ratings and uses some politically incorrect language.  Also the Jaberwalkie may be frightening to some children.  Just remind the child that this is only a man in a costume and it is inside the TV and cannot hurt them.",1169337600,,590,4.4485981308411215

I still laugh at myself now for hiding during any of the Jabberwocky scenes, but hey, I was 4.  What I love now, is knowing all the classic actors that are in this film.

I had not seen this movie as a child; those that say it's faithful to the book must have read something other than Lewis Carroll's Alice. However, the kitsch value is considerable; cheezy music and costumes, pure 1985. That being said, the Jabberwock was pretty cool in that ""Godzilla-man-in-the-rubber-suit"" sort of way. Also, the set design was very handsome. It's too bad that the lighting technology of the time couldn't have been more varied; everything looks somewhat flat and two dimensional. The film that comes closest to Tenniel's original Alice illustrations is the 1933 Paramount b & w version; it's not available on dvd but occasionally turns up on Turner Classics.",1161993600,4,781,5.109375

Back in the 80's when I was about 7 or 8 years old, this 2 part movie came on TV and we recorded it, of course it was on Beta back then. I totally fell in love with this movie. After I only saw it once or twice, I wasn't able to see it again for the longest time because my family lost the tape and TV never showed it. So I was wanting it for years and finally in the late 90's, like 98 or 99, I just happened to look in the Disney store and saw both Alice In Wonderland (1985) and Alice Through The Looking Glass (1985) and I bought them right away. They were on VHS but it doesn't really matter because I love them so much. To this day, at 27 years old, I still love this 2 part film and never get bored of it.

I have watched many other versions of Alice In Wonderland and no other version has had an Alice as good as Natalie Gregory or a white rabbit as good as Red Buttons. Even Ringo Starr is in this version. I totally love that rabbit costume and back in the 80's, you can tell, or at least I can tell how much work the director put into this film. Since 1985, other versions haven't shown as much detail and work like this version has. Even the roses in the rose garden looks real. The set design is just amazing and the actors performances are truly magnificent!  This is the ULTIMATE version of Alice In Wonderland and Alice Through The Looking Glass!

I have to say that this is one of the best versions of Alice in Wonderland, simply because they do not make movies like this anymore. I remember as a kid how much I loved this movie,the stars in this movie like Martha Raye and Sammy Davis Jr., can never be duplicated again. Television has changed so much since the last twenty years. Grant it, that is quite a while ago, but you could never do this kind of movie today, because the stars are not the same. Frankly, I don't think the stars of today have the personality or talent, like they did back in the eighties. Anyway, this movie is such a gem of a film. If you grew up with this film, or if you are introducing it to your own children. This is the Wonderland to beat.",1150329600,3,783,4.058064516129032

603320,5,6303212220,"Finally after years of waiting, fans (and children of the 80s) can finally take home the fondly-remembered 1985 two-part television musical production of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, produced by Irwin Allen and featuring just about every single showbusiness personality of the time.

Part One opens with Alice (played winningly by Natalie Gregory) wishing she was old enough to enjoy afternoon tea with all of the grownups.  After going down to the lake she spies a White Rabbit (Red Buttons), follows him down a rabbit-hole and into a kaleidoscope of colour and fantasy.  Alice meets many wonderful characters like the Caterpillar (Sammy Davis Jr.), the Duchess and her eccentric cook (Martha Raye and Imogene Coca), the Mad Hatter (Anthony Newley), the Mock Turtle (Ringo Starr) and the Cheshire Cat (Telly Savalas).  Finally after a brush with the head-chopping Queen of Hearts (Jayne Meadows), Alice escapes, only to discover she is in fact trapped on the wrong side of the mirror.

Part Two finds Alice now somehow in Looking-glass Land, which is actually a giant chess-game.  In order to win the game and hopefully return home, Alice must make it to the eighth square of the board.  On her way Alice meets many more wondrous characters like Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee (Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme), the Red Queen (Ann Jillian), the White Queen (Carol Channing), the White King (Harvey Korman) and the White Knight (Lloyd Bridges).  But throughout her journey Alice is terrorised by the scary Jabberwocky dragon which thrives on fear.  Alice must conquer her fears of the Jabberwocky if she is ever to return home...

Famous for star-studded films of the 70s like ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"", producer Irwin Allen made sure the cast of this spectacular ALICE IN WONDERLAND featured just about every single showbusiness veteran and notable of the day.  It would have been easy for Natalie Gregory to have become overwhelmed or overshadowed by her cavalcade of co-stars but the appealing young actress holds her own and gives a very solid performance, though it must be noted that her singing was in fact dubbed by another little girl called Lara Beeson.  The musical numbers, written by legendary host Steve Allen (who also appears as the Paper Suit Man during Part Two), are all very fine and perfect for the characters but the best number by far is the beautiful ballad ""Emotions"", delivered by Ann Jillian in a tear-inducing rendition.

Children of the 80s remember this version with a lot of nostalgia, and it's so lovely to think we can now introduce this gem to our own children.

603365,5,6303212220,"When I was eight years old, this version of Alice in Wonderland was aired on T.V.  I thought I had watched the best movie ever at that time, and still, to this day, I have more fond memories of watching that movie than any other time in my life!  The songs were beautiful!  I can still sing the song Alice sang to the deer - ""Why do people act as if they're crazy?  Why to they behave the way they do? I have to say, this is one my favorite songs of all time!

If you get a chance to purchase and watch this movie, you will witness the beautiful music!",1146787200,,552,3.936936936936937
603366,5,6303212220,"This is the best Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass I've ever seen. It made such an impression on me from as far back as late 1985 that I have remembered it from childhood till now when I recently found it. It stands the test of time, and is more faithful to Lewis Carroll's written version than most others. It's too bad that this title is so hard to find and rare. Watching it you can tell that a lot of good effort was put into it. It was not just thrown together. The quality comes across, and is therefore not a waste of time or insult to the audience. It's probably not a good idea to let young children watch it though. The Jabberwocky is pretty scary.",1145318400,3,670,4.2421875

The music and song lyrics have haunted my mind with only good memories throughout the years!  Even though I am 28 years old (will be 29 this year), I still love this movie.

I have to congratulate Harry Harris for his wonderful directing skills and the music composers for the beautiful music!  I also thought that Natalie Gregory had the most beautiful singing voice, so I tried to sing like her!  Thanks to Natalie, I had taken singing lessons.  I am now a pianist, singer, songwriter, and actress, and it is all because of the motivation from this movie!",1138665600,3,692,4.548387096774194

After I only saw it once or twice, I wasn't able to see it again for the longest time because my family lost the tape and TV never showed it. So I was wanting it for years and finally in the late 90's, like 98 or 99, I just happened to look in the Disney store and saw both Alice In Wonderland (1985) and Alice Through The Looking Glass (1985) and I bought them right away. They were on VHS but it doesn't really matter because I love them so much. To this day, at 27 years old, I still love this 2 part film and never get bored of it.

I have watched many other versions of Alice In Wonderland and no other version has had an Alice as good as Natalie Gregory or a white rabbit as good as Red Buttons.  That Jabberwocky used to scare me back then also.  Even Ringo Starr is in this version. I totally love that rabbit costume and back in the 80's, you can tell, or at least I can tell how much work the director put into this film. Since 1985, other versions haven't shown as much detail and work like this version has. Even the roses in the rose garden looks real.

It told the story to tell the story, not to have every almost no name actor make a little comeback.  The little girl that plays Alice is a good actress and plays the part very well.  All the songs in the story are fun or lesson oriented, lets face it the whole story is lesson oriented, but it is really fun too.

My sister & I video taped it & watched it constantly!  We managed to hang onto that tape for over 10 years before it got misplaced.  As soon as I got the internet I looked it up & purchased both on VHS.  I was not disappointed.  I enjoy this movie just as much now as I did 20 years ago!  The songs are fun & guaranteed to keep you humming! I have to say that even though I am a huge Disney fan, I found the animated Disney version confusing, boring, & even annoying.  If you love Alice or love musicals, you've got to see this version!  I agree with what others have written, I'm hoping they come out with a DVD & soundtrack, & I think that a rerelease for TV would be great!

The book ""Alice in Wonderland"" is supposed to be completely inane, and the movie is entirely faithful to that ridiculousness and grand stupidity.  except of course that everything seems sped up and elevated to a profound level of retardedness and drunken hysteria that is quite pleasing to me.  In my opinion the best people in the cast are CAROL CHANNING (by far), Martha Raye as the duchess, Imogene Coca as the cook, and Jayne Meadows as the queen of hearts.  ""Jam Tomorrow"" and ""Walrus and the Carpenter"", as well as the Arithmetic Lesson taught by Ann Jillian and Carol at the end, are my favorite songs, and are always in my head.  THE MAIN THING I DONT UNDERSTAND is WHY isn't there a soundtrack to this movie???? the songs are hilarious and actually pretty good, in a deranged, giddy disney-movie/cabaret kind of way... if you know what i mean.  This movie should totally be RE-RELEASED, put on DVD, recorded onto a publicly available SOUNDTRACK, and screened at midnight showings across the country.  It is a cult classic waiting to happen.  And I think it's really kind of a shame that more people haven't seen it and fallen in love (or maniacal obsession) as I have.  And that is all I have to say.  Thank you.",1097020800,,1342,4.55

I especially liked Natalie Gregory as Alice. She played the role well as the naive little girl who wants to grow up but childhood wants to keep just a little longer. Steve Allen's soundtrack is absolutly brilliant. However the backgrounds are dated and cheesy but it fits the story perfectly as well because it is a dream after all.

Then in 1985,  television announced they not only were going to remake this classic film,  but convert it to LIVE ACTION! This was unheard of at the time.
You don't  take a animated classic like Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland"" and  convert it to live action. Aside from minor changes this movie is  exceptional. The cast outstanding. Natalie Gregory does a great job in the  title role as ""Alice.""
I have found usually you lose something  in the story when it is remade. Not to mention, television took a chance  when they converted ""Alice in Wonderland"" from animation to LIVE  ACTION. However I believe in this case, with live action you gain  something.
