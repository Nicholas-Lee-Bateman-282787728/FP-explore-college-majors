Christopher Frayling excellently wrote & narrated this expansive documentary.  The only drawback: grandstanding.  Frayling's relentless onscreen appearances are just plain awkward at times - tending to distract rather than engage.",1214870400,18,805,5.265625

2518553,5,B000EGEJJ8,A very accurate and detailed account of Egyptian history and the search for King Tutankhamun.  A must have for any fan of Egyptology and/or history.  Each disk is well narrated and well presented.  Highly recommended!,1168992000,2,217,5.142857142857143
2518554,5,B000EGEJJ8,"Christopher Frayling's BBC documentary from the early nineties is one of the better pieces of television history on ancient Egypt (second only, in my opinion, to John Romer's 1984 effort 'Ancient Lives'- when will that one be commercially released?).  Frayling's penchant for cultural history works tremedously well here as he surveys both the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb itself and the significance of the discovery in the western cultural developments during the twentieth century. From an in-depth analysis of Howard Carter's work to interviews with various assorted Californian hippies with mummy fixations, this is a fascinating, well-researched and very entertaining look at the whole Tut phenomenon.  It is a relief also to report that unlike many an American edition the series has not been hacked around with inexpert and insensitive editing.  Highly recommended.",1165276800,13,876,5.621212121212121
2518555,4,B000EGEJJ8,"Overall I enjoyed this and think it's a nice addition to an Egypt-phile's DVD collection, however, there was one error so glaring in the 3rd episode of disc one that I HAD to comment, and I am stil boggling that it wasn't caught in post production, let alone when it happened. When the host is discussing the theory of ""radioactive"" Mummies, the mummy shown is *NOT* Tutankhamun, but the mummy believed to be Seti 1. You can look at a photo earlier in the show and see Tut, and see that the two are not even remotely similar. Other then this, as I said, an enjoyable, in depth documentary, worth the money.",1153612800,12,606,4.419642857142857
2518556,5,B000EGEJJ8,"This series was originally broadcast in the UK in the early/mid 1990s. It is superbly constructed, beautifully narrated and is easily the best ever programme in the Egyptology genre. Frayling is brilliant at building the suspense - almost as if he was narrating a whodunnit novel. I have been trying to get a copy for years as my original video was lost. Brilliant. An absolute must.",1142726400,31,383,4.818181818181818

Having had the pleasure of meeting Prof. Frayling on a number of occasions , his lucid, knowledgeable style and impeccable delivery are enchanting. The photography is superb and the discs are a joy to own. Bliss to relive my own journey to look into the face of Tutankhamun.",1444176000,,355,4.476923076923077

8109490,1,B000EGEJJ8,"Let there be no misunderstanding about this: the series itself is very much deserving of five stars. I saw it as a kid on German television over 20 years ago and it stuck with me ever since.

I still have many vivid memories of an episode detailing ""Tut-Mania"", which left its marks on contemporary art and architecture. There were bits on the Chrysler Building and Harrods, commercials of mummies trying to get those pesky blood stains out, the story beind the Tutankhamun-exhibition, Ramses-brand condoms (""Ramses fathered over 100 children"", says Professor Frayling), a story of Howard Carter getting litigitious over a replica of the Tutankhamun-tomb at the world fair and excerpts from De Mille's ""The Ten Commandments"" and Lang's ""Metropolis"". All this made for a colorful and highly entertaining episode. Like I said, it stuck with me in rich detail and that alone should tell you something about the quality of the series.

However, said episode is not included on this set. Nowhere can a warning be found on the front or back of the cover. No mention whatsoever of an episode having been removed for whatever reason. To top it all off, one of the episodes' synopses DOES talk about Tutankhamun's influence on then-contemporary pop culture and Tut-mania, whereas the actual episode is about something else entirely.

Extra material is decent, if - with the exception of audio recordings of Carter himself - somewhat forgettable. It does in no way excuse the excision of an entire episode. At a price like this, you might feel inclined to think that they would have bothered to bring you the complete series. Avoid!",1333756800,14,1622,4.977859778597786
8109491,5,B000EGEJJ8,"Very well done, so much so that you felt you were there - segment on Belzoni was especially interesting - EXCELLENT! If I could afford it, I'd send a set to each of my sisters since I won't part with mine.",1232236800,3,205,4.024390243902439
