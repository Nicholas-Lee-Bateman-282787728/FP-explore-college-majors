5893315,5,B00E6F15HM,"I saw this (POV/Live in Athens) concert tour in Dallas, Texas. It was my first Peter Gabriel (PG) concert, and to this day, my favorite concert EVER!!

Peter ""connects"" with his audience in a way few performers can. He feeds off the crowd energy, and is the one artist who consistently outperforms his studio tracks with his live renditions.

Those who were fortunate enough to see PG (& his amazing team) perform during this tour ought to feel extremely blessed & privileged. There are some magical moments in his Secret World & Growing Up tour performances, but the entire POV/Live in Athens tour was TRULY MAGICAL!!

This concerts versions of San Jacinto, Shock the Monkey, No Self Control, Mercy Street, Lay Your Hands On Me & In Your Eyes are the best of all the live performances I've witnessed. Biko is a close second to PG's Secret World tour.

If you are a long-time PG fan, I know you've likely been awaiting the release of this Bluray disc, which also LOOKS & SOUNDS AMAZING. I can [finally] put my Laserdisc version to bed. I had purchased 2 copies on Laserdisc, just in case one ever got damaged. That is how much I LOVED (was moved by) this concert performance, and this Bluray version is even better, as well as more complete.",1380067200,7,1241,4.601809954751131
5893316,5,B00E6F15HM,This is easily one of my favorite all time concert videos.  The quality of this video recording is superb.  This show features an all star musician lineup with a great setlist.  Peter Gabriel is at the very top of his game in this show.  Highly recommended for any fan of Peter Gabriel.,1380067200,6,286,4.4423076923076925
5893317,4,B00E6F15HM,"This 1987 performance is a few years before Secret Garden but has some of the same songs.  The most euphoric is his version of In Your Eyes.  The version of Don't Give Up is lacking the female vocalist.  My wife observed that within one song some performers changed outfits, so this must be a splice of multiple performances.  Still I love the early PG and honestly not the recent stuff.",1379894400,2,387,4.485714285714286
5893318,5,B00E6F15HM,"I was really frustrated this was not released sooner but it was likely smart strategy and we are benefitting from recent restoration and processing technology. I honestly don't know if there's a more powerful and meaningful live show available. While&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Gabriel-Secret-World-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B007XNAQL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Gabriel: Secret World - Live [Blu-ray</a>] is excellent and offers more theatrical elements, it was photographed in 16mm and the graininess is a bit revealing on Blu-ray. Live in Athens was photographed in 35mm and the impact is stunning. The Athens show captures emotional music played by elite musicians. Manu Katche's drumming is so musical while Tony Levin, David Sancious and David Rhodes are all superhuman.

Also worth noting, we finally get to see and hear Youssou N Dour's opening set with his band Le Super Etoile de Dakar which, alone, might be worth the discs's price.

I paid just over $20 in 1990 for the VHS so the $18 Blu-ray disc is a bargain.",1379721600,32,1073,5.784810126582278
5893319,5,B00E6F15HM,"This is the first time I have seen this concert, I can only imagine the difference going from VHS to Blu-Ray, it was excellent. The concert and footage were excellent, I had never seen him perform some of his earlier numbers. I have always loved his band. My one bit of disappointment was him singing both parts (both male and female parts) of Don't Give Up, but for those who may not have already been familiar with the song, he still did it well. I am so glad they included Youssour N'Dour's opening set, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm very glad I bought this Blu-Ray, I definitely recommend it, but I do agree with the other reviewer in that I hope Peter comes out with some new material. I think his orchestral rendition of his material is wonderful, the Scratch My Back is an interesting concept, but I am waiting for some new material, he is such a creative, talented musician and lyricist.",1379721600,2,894,4.49079754601227
5893320,5,B00E6F15HM,"I watched my vhs copy of this concert many times, many years ago. The concert is still as great as I remembered, with minimalist but very expressive lighting and choreography. The blu-ray does justice to it, with great video and sound quality. Including the Youssou N'Dour opening set is a very nice touch. The extra ""Play"" DVD makes this a pretty good deal for any Gabriel fan.",1379462400,9,378,4.656716417910448
5893321,5,B00E6F15HM,"I am not reviewing the product because I already own so many Live Peter Gabriel albums, so please forgive me if I sound ungrateful.  Of course I celebrate the Peter of yesteryear, the experimental Peter of the 1980s, the emotionally magnificent Peter of the 1990s, the dark edgy Peter of 2000, but what I need now, and I mean I NEED this like another Chapter to the Book of Life, is a new Peter Gabriel that speaks to this decade, to this time, to this point of his life.  Yes, yes, I know his music is about the heart and therefore transcends time - but we're also talking about one of the most significant songwriters of his generation (or EVER in my book) and though every artist gets older, I would love for him to do as Yeats says and ""rage against the dying of the light.""  His new masterpiece could be recorded in a dingy basement with only a baby grande, it could be captured in a peeling broken down barn with only an accoustic guitar, bass and a Polish steel drum player (don't laugh...peter could find one)and locusts ringing in the summer air.

My point is, it doesn't have to be PERFECT, nothing is perfect, if fact, art is only enhanced by raw imperfections, and most importantly, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO ""LIVE UP TO"" THIS NOSTALGIA WORSHIPPING GREATEST HITS CULTURE.  It only needs to be an expression of Peter Gabriel whatever that is, broken free from the pressures of yesteryear's stadium shows.  I wish he would let us into his Secret World.  It's not that I don't appreciate the re-releases of older classics, but Peter is good enough not to need to do SO much of it.

I was at the Hollywood Bowl show last October where he performed SO in its entirety (one of my favorite albums of all time) and yes it was great to see John Cusak watching from the wings with tears in his eyes, but the HIGHLIGHT of that show was when Peter busted out an untitled song that was so new that he didn't even have lyrics for it.  I'm listening to this gorgeous ballad and I'm thinking, ""I NEED THIS SONG, MY LIFE NEEDS THIS - BUT WHERE ARE THE WORDS???""  Of course I was appreciative of this peek into his creative process, but all he needed to do was write something down...ANYTHING and we, the audience would have followed his powerful instincts like puppies after the shaman's kibble.  I feel that episode sadly embodied the reason why I haven't seen an album of new Peter Gabriel songs in over 10 years, he's too careful with his jewels.  And as I said, he doesn't need to be.  The music business has changed so much and I have heard some truly earth-shattering songs from the most minimal of productions (Eluvium, Grouper, Bon Ivar)  Of course, it's Peter's work and he can do whatever he darn well pleases, but it's only my two cents that his greatness is not something that only existed in 1987, and with this current output many youngins might think that he's a dated artist cashing in on his former accomplishments.  I personally refuse to believe this.  Peter's greatest work is yet to come.  I only wish he would release it in the same spiritual, musical, emotional, unpretentious outpour that he is known and LOVED for.",1377734400,10,3127,4.4867724867724865
5893322,5,B00E6F15HM,"Not exactly POV,same concert though, some video is out, a few more songs are in, great, GREAT show, PG at the height his powers. This concert could be better than Secret World Live. Not as monumental a presentation, but perhaps more profound and expressive. Total ownership of the audience. The usual suspects in that era band: Levin, Rhodes, Katch, Sancious, all rock.

The video is excellent, the sound great, quite nice surround. I'm speaking of the DVD, included in the 25th anniversary edition of So, the Blu Ray is bound to exceed that quality. I'm jealous because this BR release diminishes the exclusivity of the long awaited re-release of POV (sort of) in modern media, which came in the So Box Set, but that's your gain. On the other hand, I saw it 10 months ago so we're even.

Highly recommended, one of the great Showmasters of Rock, one of the best concert movies ever.",1377561600,10,883,4.690322580645161
5893323,5,B00E6F15HM,"This is quite brilliant.
First, the video and audio are great. I saw some reviews stating poor quality, that's rubbish.
Second, I saw several reviews babbling on about overdubs. I saw no terribly obvious overdubs, the reviews made it sound like a 70's Japanese movie, it's not. There likely are overdubs, if you have seen or heard a live album or video in the last twenty or so years, you can almost guarentee overdubs. A live concert is an experience that involves more than eyes and ears. A video or album is purely eyes and ears, so an audience more and more with unrealistic expectations is almost certainly going to get overdubs.
But does it detract from the show? Not at all. Unless you are an extremely picky wannabe audio engineer, you will not notice anything particularly strange on here.
Great song selection, although family and the fishing net is not a favourite.
Another brilliantly choreographed show, that reaffirms Gabriel as a master of visual art in the field of music.
If you like Gabriel's first 5 solo albums, and you like concerts, you will love this. I already had the ""play"" bonus disc, so I guess a friend will get lucky there.

5893327,1,B00E6F15HM,"I bought two of these, one as a gift and one for myself.  I intended to buy CDs, but I ordered these instead.  My fault.  I opened one and tried to listen; it would not play on my iMac.  Furthermore, the notes brochure inside the case was torn at the bottom in three places, indicating either careless packing by the manufacturer (doubtful) or a used item (?).  Regardless, I noticed that it was a DVD and I tried playing it with my DVD player.  It worked, but the quality was 1980s crappy MTV video stuff -- I could find it for free on YouTube.  Disappointing, at best.  When I returned it, I expected to absorb the cost of shipping - after all, I made the mistake of ordering a DVD.  But I was also charged a $7.00 restocking fee in addition to the shipping, which was more than half the cost of the DVD when (supposedly) new.  I don't recall seeing any notice of a restocking fee before returning it.  Lessons: Make sure you buy the right thing, because returning the wrong thing will cost you A LOT; be wary of ""new"" merchandize -- if you open it and it is clearly damaged, you may end up paying for things outside your control; look hard for hidden fees (like restocking) -- I certainly didn't see it.  Cost of doing business on the internet with Amazon, I guess.",1457740800,,1268,4.30379746835443
5893328,2,B00E6F15HM,"Would you take a Sharpie and make the smile on Leonardo Da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" wider because you think it's too small?  That's the same as dubbing mostly studio vocals for live concert vocals post facto.  If Peter Gabriel okayed this substitution, then this DVD is merely a matching lips studio recording with the outdoor concert setting and film footage as backdrop.  In other words, karaoke.  Stick with SECRET WORLD LIVE for the best unslicked concert performance by Gabriel that's ever been captured on video, despite the widely acknowledged, occasional visual blurriness and haziness.  Gabriel never had a better backup singer than Paula Cole, and she blossoms with the whole band on SECRET WORLD LIVE, the best tracks of which are all bona fide classics from his best solo studio album, SO, that are genuinely done LIVE: ""Sledgehammer,"" ""Don't Give Up,"" ""In Your Eyes,"" and ""Red Rain.""

5893338,5,B00E6F15HM,",  This was a concert from 1987 staged in a beautiful Greek amphitheater.  What struck me most, in purchasing this 2-CD concert some thirty years after the fact, is how physical a performer he was then.  Like David Byrne in Stop Making Sense, Gabriel uses the entire stage, running, dancing in step, emulating jungle creatures.  It's a very theatrical show, at times maybe too artsy in moments as he performs the entirety of Mercy Street in a fetal position lying on the stage.  But he's very passionate about his songs and these, unlike the fare most other rock artists, are songs of great substance, taking on geopolitics, human oppression and our demons within.  The audience is fantastic, rocking it under a beautiful night sky, providing great wide shots of the stage and the fans.  Stand out performances are an entrancing Family Snapshot, a repeated shoutout of ""No more war!"" at the end of Games Without Frontiers and a can't-miss Solsbury Hill.  The second CD is a collection of all his music videos, a real  treat.  Most include gorgeous animation that at the time was cutting edge and still inspires.  I really can't imagine a better portrait of the man than these 2 CDs.  A one-of-a-kind performer at the height of his talents.",1434931200,,1239,4.7924528301886795

5893340,5,B00E6F15HM,"Peter Gabriel Live in Athens is a magnificent concert. This is the second Peter Gabriel concert DVD I own; I purchased Secret World Blu-ray last year. I like Secret World a lot but I fell in love with Live in Athens. I received Live in Athens last week and already watched it three times. In second and third viewings, I tried to experience the lip-sync/overdub issue brought up by some other reviewers but I am not sure what they are referring to. I paid very close attention to Peter Gabriel's lips and also the playing of the instruments and I couldn't experience any gap between the audio and the video. Either those reviewers are talking about another edition of the same concert (VHS/DVD maybe?) or I am missing something. If you have seen lip-sync/overdub problem with the Blu-ray, please let me know which song, exact time it happens, and what to look for because I'd really like to know what the fuzz is about. Maybe there is another way to understand that the concert is overdubbed, maybe some people are such audiophiles, they can tell just by hearing the sound.

I think the concert was just awesome. Pre-show begins with some musicians from Africa and I really liked their act. They play about 40 minutes and then Peter Gabriel's show begins. I liked the selection of the songs and I loved his performance. I loved the ambiance too. It appeared like a small stage but for such a small stage there was so much energy from the musicians and also from the audience. At one point, Peter Gabriel turns his back on the audience and drops backward onto the audience who does a pretty good job of handling him (that's the picture you see on the cover). They carry him over their heads, I thought that was quite a fascinating act, a little risky for the performer but pays off immensely as an act. Audience did a great job except for the part they tore his jacket apart ha ha.

I absolutely loved the musicians, they were all terrific. Peter Gabriel is another class altogether. His musicianship is just beyond this world. It's too bad there are no artists like Peter Gabriel anymore. The concert ends with a terrific rendering of Biko, brought tears to my eyes. The African musicians from the pre-show joins Peter Gabriel on Biko. Blu-ray video and audio quality is terrific. It is better than some other Blu-ray films, concerts I have from that era. They did an awesome job with this product. There is a nice booklet inside the Blu-ray case with photos from the concerts and information on the crew. The concert itself is a real treat but then there is the HD version of Sledgehammer video!!!  I had been waiting to see the Sledgehammer video in HD for more than a decade. And there is also an interview with Peter Gabriel from that time which I thought was a great extra feature. Moreover, there is also another DVD (standard DVD) with major videos of Peter Gabriel, there is like more than 20 videos.

Overall this is a terrific concert and product to purchase. If you like Peter Gabriel, you should order this now! I have already seen it 3 times and I want to see it again, and again and again....",1433203200,3,3106,4.560931899641577

While interesting simply as a side-by-side comparison, what is also amazing is the way in which this concert DVD demonstrates that Mr. Gabriel's love for the audience and his commitment to providing an unforgettable and provocative show did not dim in those intervening years.  The amount of included songs is great without being overwhelming (if such a thing is possible).  Highlights include San Jacinto, Sledgehammer (both versions), In Your Eyes (both), and Steam, although all are worth viewing from beginning to end in order to get an idea of the ebb and flow of the concerts.",1402099200,,1069,5.239766081871345

I know how disappointed I was with the Secret World Live DVD because it was cropped at the top and bottom to make it ""appear"" widescreen when it was not shot that way. Tops of heads cut off. While I expected more of the same with this release, I expected the sound quality to at least match the VHS. The output of this disc is so high that it causes signal overload. All but the quietest songs are distorted. The difference is staggering. If I usually play a disc with the volume set at 75%, for example, with this disc, I set it to 25%. It was mastered so high as to be all but unlistenable as the audio signal is so hot coming out of the player that it overloads whatever I send it to. Distortion is there no matter the set volume. I really loved this concert and saw this tour but I'll be playing my old VHS next time I want to relive the memory. I can't believe I'm the only one that is offended by the sound.

The video is pretty good to considering the age and transfer. Seeing these guys and hearing this music 30 years younger brings back some fond memories.

5893402,5,B00E6F15HM,"BUY THIS NOW...I have never seen this concert movie until today. The only video I have seen from anywhere near this era is his ""Secret World"". I love the SW concert video. It has a mystical quality and is actually enhanced by it's grainy visual quality. So now viewing this other concert is a totally new way of seeing him from that era. The picture here is PRISTINE! I can't believe the quality. The sound is immaculate (although I understand overdubbed in some places). The closest I can approximate this film is to Johnathan Demme's Talking Heads concert ""Stop Making Sense"". It is THAT good. It comes close to the intensity of SMS in that the camera prowls the stark and bare stage as Peter gives a WOW performance. High point of this is definitely when he body surfs the crowd on ""Lay Your Hands on Me"". It has a real odd exhilarating and spooky quality to it. Plus I get the bonus DVD of his creative video work. Peter is an media artist in the best sense of the word. At once both thought provoking and energetic. He is running on all cylinders here.",1383609600,2,1057,4.425641025641026
5893403,3,B00E6F15HM,"It's hard not to love Peter Gabriel's live performances but this camera crew does their best to make you try. I'm just glad the tour was caught on film at all, even if done rather poorly and without vision as this video displays.  I am a huge Peter Gabriel fan and own all of his other concert DVD's but this one is probably a one-time view.

Gabriel is a genius at telling and acting out the stories of his songs.  Sadly, the ad-hoc camera crew seemed unable to consider that Gabriel designed the stage show to be seen from a distance and they kept him close in frame most of the time, negating the effect he was going for in the first place.

The other thing which is troublesome is a SPOILER ALERT so scroll down a bit if you're interested, otherwise buy the video and be happy.

So, it's like this...  I have a pretty good eye for certain details of live performance which is a blessing and a curse.  Several songs into the show I realized that with VERY little exception, the vocals (and perhaps much more) were overdubbed later. It was done very well with Peter clearly watching his own mouth to match the cadence but between microphone positioning and the obvious problem of dancing and moving around so much, all except maybe one or two songs are overdubbed in a studio later.  This is, in my opinion an unpardonable sin.  Big stage shows often do it from Michael Jackson to Madonna, what you see on video is not what happened live and MJ even lip-synced much of his show due to the complexity and energy required for his dance numbers. And, so it is possible the same has happened here.",1383523200,28,1630,4.303921568627451
5893404,4,B00E6F15HM,"The video quality is amazing, and it is great that they have produced such an amazing quality document from an amazing tour after 20 years. However, the audio is so treated and rerecorded in the studio that it taints an otherwise amazing experience. How is Peter Gabriel so vain in this area that he continues to rerecord live concerts in the studio, as in his Play's Live CD and Genesis Boxed Sets? If people wanted a studio recording, they would not be buying the live recording. We want to hear the energy and flaws, just as we have seen in the actual concert. What we have here sounds excellent (quality) yet stale (content).

The other problem in this set is the Play DVD (note: not blu-ray) which is great to have, but uses often inferior quality sources and a poorly designed menu. Every time you play a track, it goes back to the menu again, so very confusing to play all tracks.

So, this is an awesome concert and amazing performance, and quite a good price for what you get...but could have been so much better if not for some silly things.",1383523200,6,1051,4.46875

I feel extremely fortunate to have witnessed the dissemination of brilliance from this gentle soul.... since Genesis.  As I watch Peter age, (just saw him live last week), I am filled with angst as I realize there is no one to carry the torch.  This applies to all the rock icons who are in their late 60's...I'm an optimist, but musically, the future is bleak.  So, I beseech all you Gabriel fans, to get your children involved when watching his masterpieces (Secret, Growing, and this).  My 5 year old daughter often asks to watch ""Peter""...and then she asks why ""my eyes get wet"".  When she hums Mercy Street, I want to tell her the story of Anne Sexton....but that will be another story we can share when she gets older....

The core of this 2 disc set is Gabriel performing in Athens Greece in October of 1987 (supposedly the ""full show"", but probably culled from a multi date set),and it is a really great concert - a great band, great set list, and great audience - despite the dated clothing/appearances on stage - lol. I especially like that it is Gabriel as his dramatic self, but without all the elaborate yet somewhat distracting props that were soon to come (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Gabriel-Secret-World-Live/dp/B00008977N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Gabriel - Secret World Live</a>). This show alone would be enough reason to get this DVD, but the real bonus for me is that Youssou N'Dour was with him.

The concert disc begins with N'Dour and his Senegalese band Le Super Etoile De Dakar as the warm up act with a set of 5 vibrant songs, that are a nice contrast to the slick PG show that follows. I think this is the first concert DVD I've ever seen that also shows the warm up band! Youssou is at the beginning of his meteoric rise here. He would on go to become an even more popular and famous performer than Gabriel (in 2004 Rolling Stone described him as ""perhaps the most famous singer alive"", I'd also add that he is perhaps in the top handful of the greatest vocalists alive). The inclusion of Youssou's set is a real treat, and having him and some of his band join PG for the last 2 songs of the main concert are the highlights of that show (the 15+ minute version of ""In Your Eyes"" is quite remarkable).

Disc 2 is another great bonus; Gabriel's 23 music videos from 1980 to 2004. Gabriel always has had a reputation for theatrics and top quality production, and these videos show an abundance of creativity. They may not be the kind of thing you want to watch very often but they are nice to have - and express an era (early MTV) well.",1380326400,4,1909,4.743975903614458
