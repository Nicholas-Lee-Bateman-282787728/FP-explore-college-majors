8313048,4,B001JL96JA,"Good gritty low-budget Western about gunmen for hire during a range war, their code of ethics, and the final confrontation between the young fast draw and his mentor, the older gunslinger who taught the kid everything. What I liked was the no-nonsense attitude of those involved. You're hired to do a job and if you're on opposite sides against your best friend, well...no hard feelings.
Lane Chandler is the young gunfighter Ken Wayne and reminds me of John Wayne during his Lone Star period; big, likeable, capable, easy going with a sense of fairplay, a pretty good performance.
But the real deal here is getting a rare chance to see silent Western star Neal Hart as the elder gunman ""Whispering"" Carlyle, and it's an outstanding performance; relaxed, confident, assured of his talents, Hart's Carlyle is a charmer, a grizzled range war vet who lives by the same gun code and sense of fairplay that he taught to Ken Wayne, now supposedly the fastest gun alive. Hart, in stature, leaning against a fence, or firing his six-shooter just looks so professional! A real treat to watch this silent star steal scenes in a Ben Johnson sort of way.
Neither man is good or bad, just on opposite sides.
When the heroine asks Ken what will happen should he and Carlyle have to come up against each other he tells her with a laugh that one of them would have to die, but that's just the way it is when you hire on to do a job.
A good supporting cast includes Hank Bell and Ben Corbett also as hired guns and Yak Canutt as a crooked sheriff
The ALPHA dvd is in pretty good shape, coming from the SAMUEL M. SHERMAN ARCHIVES.
Still, this is an amazingly cheap production with a corny lock 'em up/hands up routine that could have appeared in a GET SMART tv episode. But lack of budget does give this film a raw edge look and we also get a good 1932 look at the Los Angeles countryside.
Nowhere near a classic but certainly entertaining. Must viewing for fans of early talking B-Westerns. And a wonderful Neal Hart performance. You just can't go wrong here. Highly recommended.",1260489600,3,2062,4.575675675675676
