8596590,2,B001UE7CC4,I am being kind when I give this two stars. No plot. Too much inside joking for audience but I can't believe this movie was made to be taken seriously. Not the best of the sequels.,1521417600,,180,4.027777777777778
8596591,5,B001UE7CC4,"A great stupid fun movie i really enjoyed this, now im waiting to see serial rabbit V. Hope its as silly as this one is!",1515110400,,120,3.84
8596592,5,B001UE7CC4,I had a great time working on this Texas Indy film cult icon!,1497571200,,61,3.769230769230769
8596593,1,B001UE7CC4,"The 4 and 5 star review are completely wrong. And yes in this instance Their opinion is actually wrong. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. There is nothing thought provoking about it, unless you have the intelligence of a snail. The movie itself is insulting to those of us with a brain and good taste.",1373673600,,312,4.589285714285714
8596594,1,B001UE7CC4,Even for a B casted movie... the acting is terrible.... everything is predictable... and just overall VERY VERY awful. I would not recommend to my worst enemy,1366416000,,158,4.888888888888889
8596595,5,B001UE7CC4,Aside from 2 I think this is one of the better Serial Rabbit sequels. Overall this movie is a tear jerking and a thought provoking film that leaves one to further question themselves. Also.... EPIC.,1362096000,3,198,4.685714285714286
8596596,4,B001UE7CC4,"I found this movie to be funny, campy and interesting. For an independent film, I was rather pleased with the story line. For those not wanting something too bloody and scary then I highly recommend watching Serial Rabbit 3.",1271548800,6,224,4.769230769230769
