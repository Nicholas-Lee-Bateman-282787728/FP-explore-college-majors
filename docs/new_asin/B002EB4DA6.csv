This anime isn't very deep, but it's got some really neat characters and good animation. The soundtrack is all right too. Even though the story is pretty regular there are a few touching moments, it also delivers plenty of comedy too. I'm not gonna lie and say it's one of the best animes I've seen; but I'm glad I did see it. It's pretty enjoyable. Maybe check it out on youtube or netflix to see what you think.",1354147200,,653,4.308943089430894
