8363889,4,B002CCN0AQ,"I knew very little about the British crime film Shifty prior to seeing it. My interest was certainly piqued when a screener arrived in the mail in the form of a Ziplock bag with a pretty neat looking prescription label stuck to the front. It became pretty obvious this was a drug-themed movie, which that in itself usually wouldn't be my type of flick, but I gotta say the effort in the marketing made it much more exciting.

The films starts of with Chris (Daniel Mays) showing up on the doorstep of Shifty (Riz Ahmed), a small town crack dealer. The two reveal to be old friends, but it's clear from the beginning that they have some issues from their past and Chris has been gone for some time. Shifty, who lives with his older brother, invites Chris to stay with them and goes about his usual dealings with Chris tagging along.

We're introduced to a crime underworld that runs deep in the small town. We're introduced to a diverse range of characters including a family man who who goes to extremes to satisfy his temptation of getting his next high. Chris and Mays even find themselves running from the cops early on after an encounter with another old friend who's obtained some hot electronics. For Shifty it's all in a days work, but for Chris this is a whole different world than what he's used to.

Things get a little more heavy when Glen (Jason Flemyng) comes into the picture. Glen is a wannabe kingpin who gives reason to believe he has some shady motives. After an awkward confrontation with Chris, we know we haven't seen the last of Glen. At this point more of the history between Chris and Shifty is revealed that adds a realistic drama to the story, saving it from being a one-dimensional drug flick.

As the day goes on, things only get more interesting. Shifty finds everything around him falling apart while Chris only sees more validation as to why he left in the first place. Chris would like his friend to go back to the big city with him, but Shifty can't escape the life of a dealer who's paycheck is more tempting than security. Drama between friends inevitably builds up as they're faced with making decisions that could threaten their friendship as well as their lives.

Even though the film is entitled Shifty, the film was equally about Chris, so I'd even propose a name change (even though Shifty is quite a catchy title). Both actors do a great job of alluding to the messy history between their characters and both personalities add a different dynamic to the story. I also loved how the story combined the friendship drama with the crime angle. It would have been easy for the film to turn into a basic drug fueled cat and mouse movie but we become interested and involved in the lives of the characters. I do have to admit though, the slight twist on the ending involving Glen was a pretty damn good one for a crime/action flick.

I was very surprised by this film. It's always cool to get a glimpse into neighborhoods and lifestyles in other countries (even though i wish there were subtitles half the time, their English is a whole different language!). It was also very refreshing to see a crime story have a more serious, believable and relevant side to it. Though it turned out to be a cool and clever crime flick, the well-written characters make it a more interesting film.

8363890,4,B002CCN0AQ,"Found this to be a very good little film. While I could have used a bit more depth of character development, I liked that it didn't overreach - it felt as authentic as a 'snapshot' movie about the drugs trade can be without being a documentary. Also appreciated the Desi element... it added an interesting dimension to the story (albeit a dimension that was not explored as thoroughly as I might have liked).

In sum, certainly worth watching for its very good acting and sense of dramatic tension.",1351123200,,498,4.659090909090909
8363891,2,B002CCN0AQ,"I love good British films, so this looked worth a pull from the rental barn.

Argh. Rarely have I seen a slower, more boring ""gangster"" film. I don't need violence or shock, but I do need some sympathetic characters and a solid script. Neither is on disply here. Riz and Mays are both mediocre actors who bring no spark or edge to their performances. The script is slow and leaden, and if I don't care about the leads why should I care if they can get out of their pathetic, self-inflicted hells?

There is barely an ounce of humor anywhere in evidence here, unlike most decent Brit films, which have loads more fun even when twice as harsh as Shifty. This one goes nowhere, full of people I couldn't care one whit about, with no sense of humor or even serious drama. It's like hearing about your neighbor's endless trials in life when you just want to go home for a cuppa.

Absolutely boring in most every way, and showing a world of brain-numbing 21st-century-Dickensian working class squalor tarted up to look vaguely humane, Shifty is probably the least enjoyable and most depressing film I've seen this year, and I've seen some clunkers.

Rent at your own peril. Might help you sleep though.",1349740800,,1196,4.60093896713615

In the vein of Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, tongue in cheek crime drama at its' best.

I had heard about this movie from some friends who live in the UK.  They know what type of movies I typically like (English Gangster flicks like Snatch and Gangster #1) so they recommended $hifty.  I was blown away by how good this movie was!  It all takes place during a single day and though it's about a drug dealer ($hifty himself) the subtext of the movie is relationships - family friends and even co-workers.

The dialogue is clever, the acting is INCREDIBLE and the story is engaging, to say the least.

This isn't a movie you just see, it's one you should own and turn your friends onto.  Show it to a girl or guy you're dating and they will think you're cool just for knowing about it.",1348099200,4,1177,6.177914110429448
8363893,5,B002CCN0AQ,"This little gritty film, written and directed by Eran Creevy, is being cleverly marketed for release in the US by Breaking Glass Pictures as a prescription form for drugs and nothing could be more appropriate for a film that examines the intricate manner drugs such as cocaine, crack, etc have on little sectors of England: here, instead of London, the story is set in a seedy East London/Essex border country where drugs seem to affect everyone in one way or the other.

A bright, well-schooled Muslim lad named Shifty (Riz Ahmed, in a very fine performance) who lives with his straight mature brother Rez (Nitin Ganatra) who only tries to keep his Muslim family together.  Shifty is a young crack cocaine dealer with a regular clientele - a addicted building site worker Trevor (Jay Simpson) married to a disillusioned wife (who thought he had given up drugs) with three kids, a crack smoking old lady Valerie (Francesca Annis) in her familiar looking flat, framed photograph of a daughter, grand daughter on the mantle. etc. Shifty sees his life quickly spiral out of control when his best friend Chris (Daniel Mays) returns home after an absence of several years due to a dark secret that we only learn about at film's end. Stalked by a customer desperate to score at all costs, and with his family about to turn their back on him for good, Shifty must out-run and out-smart a rival drug dealer Glen (Jason Flemyng) intent on setting him up for a big fall. As his long time friend Chris, confronts the dark past he left behind him (nightmares abound!), Shifty is forced to face up to the violent future he's hurtling towards. And oddly it is the presence of Chris that finally, after years of remorse over a bad decision, is there for Shifty.

Much of what makes this little film work so well is the writer/director's decision to make this a series of character studies than a series of mayhem scenes.  Yes, there are brutal scenes that represent the drug world as it functions on all levels, but in the final analysis it is the story of the people reacting to the drug culture - dealers, family, druggies, victims, friends, and children of all these.  It is a very potent little film.  The only disadvantage is that there (at this time) are no subtitles, and the various forms of English accents are at times not understandable.  This is a powerful little film that delves more deeply than other films about the drug culture and its impact on society.  Grady Harp, August 12",1345075200,5,2479,4.682758620689655
8363894,5,B002CCN0AQ,"This is a great movie in the tradition of Tarantino or Guy Ritchie.  English, crime, drugs, shady characters with great stories - AWESOME.  I saw this in the theaters when I was in London because I had read so much in the English press about it and I love English Gangster movies.  The press over there was right, this is an extremely well acted, character driven story, that uses the topic of drug dealing to masquerade a story about relationships - the relationship of Shifty wth his best friend, his family, and his ""boss"".  I really can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this movie.

I hear there is a US release scheduled for later this year.",1343001600,2,651,4.483050847457627
