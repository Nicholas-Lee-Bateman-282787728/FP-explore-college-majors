8408975,5,B003YCM05O,"I hope this will help potential buyers for this blu-ray.  In order to view this blu-ray you will need a player that can convert 1080/50i signal that is on the disc to 1080/60i which is compatible with American TVs.  In the amazon search field type in ""region free blu ray player"" to see what is currently available.  Technically speaking, the disc is region free but the encode (1080/50i) is incompatible with North American TVs and blu-ray players.  I bought the same disc from amazon.co.uk and it is excellent.",1365465600,3,512,4.784090909090909
8408976,1,B003YCM05O,This is the third time I order this movie and it did not play in my blu-ray player. I have two players and it didn't play in either one of them. Seller needs to specify this movie will not play in players sold on North America. I was extremely disappointed since I am a huge fan of nature documentaries and have purchased many from amazon.,1350691200,2,339,4.230769230769231
