3757535,3,B001PR1ZNS,"Yes, another exorcism film is here, but with a Hebrew twist!  I guess the Catholic priests were too busy molesting little boys to take care of the demon in this particular film.  So instead of the tired and worn cliche's of Christian mysticism we get the same thing with some specific Hebrew mumbo-jumbo mysticism.  It's actually one of the few things that keeps this stale tale afloat, for the most part.

Personally, I was excited to hear David S. Goyer(screen and story writer behind the Blade and the new Batman films) was writing and directing a horror story involving demons.  He's an old friend of the genre having worked on Demonic Toys, the first Crow sequel, Dark City and the forementioned Blade films.  Unfortunately, The Unborn is a by-the-numbers horror yarn with few surprises, flat characters and a weak leading lady in Odette Yustman.  When Goyer films her from behind in nothing but a tank top and white panties it's the only time that she creates any semblance of a compelling screen presence.  I'm unfamiliar with her previous work and I'm not sure I want to be.

Other noteworthy players in this film are Meghan Good and Gary Oldman.  Good is fine and likeable but that's about it.  Oldman is phoning it in and collecting a check or doing his Batman collaborator a solid.  It was interesting to see a man of faith in such a mellow mood and then fairly assertive when the big bad demone shows its face, or many faces.  It's a fun contrast and an entire film about this character would've probably made a better film.  But, alas, this film centers around early twenty somethings still in college.  God forbid a horror tale be told about adults or people with a history or edge beyond a Calvin Klein commercial.  Ho-Hum...

The scares in the film are well-traveled and predicatable.  It's your basic things popping up behind you or around the coner with the lights conveniently not working.  The film does have some creepy imagery involving strangely contorted bodies of people and dogs.  I found the opening scene, a dream sequence, showcasing a terrier wearing a white blank-faced mask particularly effective.  The rest of the time the viewr just feels like the scares are just going through the motions for an hour and fifteen minutes all leading to the ten minute long exorcism action sequence.  On a technical level the film is pristine and glossy, too glossy in fact.  The Exorcist(though I find it to be very overrated)had the right idea by shooting in a more gritty style with a docu-drama feel.

Goyer is a master writer when it comes to structure and moving things along with action and placing the right big and small beats in the appropriate and pefect places in a story.  This film just seems too rushed  We don't know a thing about the characters when the film opens and it drops the main plot on us like a bomb.  How is one supposed to be scared when we don't care aobut the characters who are being scared?  I can't.  Even worse, there is so much, SO MUCH, exposition in this film in regard to what the demon is and what stops it or wards it off, that it becomes intolerable, and even worse then that, BORING.  The characters in this film spend more time talking about the plot then actually acting human, or, ya' know, being real characters!

More on the script, it is loaded with conveniences.  All films are loaded with conveniences and contrivances for the sake of moving the plot along, but if you're inovled or interested enough then you overlook them, at least until you rewatch the film a couple of times.  Since this film isn't as interesting as it should or could've been these conveniences seem to pile up far too frequently and more obviously. How lucky that the main character's mother kept clippings that would lead her to a wise old lady with all the plot's answers.  Convenient that nobody accidentally threw that browned paper clipping away.  Convenient that Gary Oldman's rabbi decies to do a stranger, a complete stranger, a really big favor by translating a Hebrew text in the form of a long ancient book, a book conveniently provided by forementioned wise old lady.  Convenient that ten people, including a priest, were available and willing to perform an exorcism.  Convenient that Meghan Good runs over a child, who survives, and threatens her, and still manages to deny her best friend is dealing with something supernatural, or even assessing the strange event in any honest way. Convenient that the main character's father is away on business(the wasted James Remar in the forgettable role)when our demon decides to cut loose.  Very convenient that the demon doesn't gain any real force or power, any that it decides to let loose, until the final exorcism.  What's with these ghosts and demonic entities, why do they like to do everything the hard and long way?  Why am I thinking about these things when all I want is to be creeped out and entertained?  It took me at least a couple of viewings before I realized how ludicris the final few minutes of Jaws were.

The Unborn is short and quick and has some striking imagery that I will never forget.  I found the Hebrew version of the whole possession rap fairly intriguing.  Gary Oldman is watchable in anything.  The final moments of the climax when the deomon wreaks all kinds of hell are quite well done and exciting and there are some unexpected casualties.  For these reasons alone I was partially entertained and can recommend this film as a decent rental.

The DVD is fairly bare-bones.  You get the PG-13 theatrical version and the unrated version of the movie.  I only watched the unrated version.  There are some snippets of gore and firece violence that I'm sure make up the one minute that makes this DVD version so unrated.  You also get some deleted scenes that are not noteworthy and an alternate version of the already forced twist ending.

Final thoughts: Forgettable but fun on some levels.  The visual effects and make up effects team for KNB effects do really good and original work. The script is too mundane.  I really, really hope that Odette Yustman is an excellent waitress,",1246924800,4,6110,4.714150943396226

3757537,4,B001PR1ZNS,"for me, i saw this as a step up over the standard horror film. yes, its got some crappy acting and an ending thats super rushed, but it does have some original aspects. i liked that it delve into Jewish mysticism and folklore and the cinematography was beautiful. if only they could have dragged the ending out a bit longer, it would have been real good. instead, its just pretty average, but you could do a lot worse.",1246924800,2,418,4.371794871794871
3757538,2,B001PR1ZNS,"When The Unborn was originally released in theaters, it was marketed as being from one of the minds behind The Dark Knight.  True, writer/director David S. Goyer played a pivotal role in bringing The Dark Knight and Batman Begins to the screen, along with writing the Blade films, but you'd never really know any of that just from watching The Unborn.  Cloverfield's Odette Yustman stars as a young woman who becomes haunted by some very creepy visions, and soon learns that she had a twin brother who died in the womb.  Next thing you know, some very bad things start to happen to her and those around her, and with plot points revolving around Nazi curses and the like, things in The Unborn don't really end up mounting to a whole lot of sense.  Goyer relies on tried and true scares and shocks, and there's certainly enough creepy imagery here as well, but in the end, The Unborn just falls flat.  Even old pros like Gary Oldman, Idris Elba, and Carla Gugino find their talents wasted here.  But hey, Odette Yustman looks quite good in only her underwear, so The Unborn isn't a total loss.",1246924800,4,1092,4.574358974358974

3757540,2,B001PR1ZNS,"This movie looked like lots of fun from the trailer, but it turned out to be a disappointment like most other horror movies that are being put out lately.

3757541,5,B001PR1ZNS,"...perhaps the most unfairly maligned horror film this year, ""The Unborn"".

The synopsis is simple: young woman finds out she is being haunted by the ghost of her unborn twin brother, who is possessed by a ""Dybuk"", a demon from Jewish lore.

Yes, the film does borrow scenes from other movies, like a take on the creepy spider-walking old lady from ""The Exorcist 3"", the old monster in the mirror gimmick, and the almost subliminal quick shots of demonic faces as used by William Friedkin in the original ""Exorcist"".

And it shows us some rather bizarre images of dogs with masks/deformed heads; I recall an installment of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series had imagery like this (maybe the end of Part 2?), as well as an unsettling scene in the remake of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" from the `70s. But, it was interesting to learn in ""The Unborn"" that this weird imagery is actually part of Jewish mysticism, so one could argue that the other movies ripped off their imagery from preexisting religious symbolism.

And yes, I'll admit, some of the most appealing images in ""The Unborn"" are that of Odette Yustman. The camera (and seemingly the film-makers) adore this beautiful woman, and even though much was made of the ""exploitation"" of her physical appearance in the film (the moral brigade really needs to get a life), she does help make the film a memorable experience.

Odette starred in last year's ""Cloverfield"", this year's ""The Unborn"", and recently signed on for a remake of an obscure UK horror film entitled ""And Soon the Darkness"".

With this kind of track record she is well along her way as a ""scream queen"", and she does have several scenes in ""The Unborn"" where she has the opportunity to live up to the title - even when she can't scream; in one scene Odette is bound to a gurney and gagged, but she still manages to emote terror quite well even while restrained and with a huge gag holding open her jaws.

In case you think acting in a film of this nature is easy, think again. Odette Yustman does a commendable job in this movie.

If you're mature enough not to hate a movie because it's PG-13 (I can't wait until the new Raimi film comes out this year with a PG-13 rating and makes apologists out of the PG-13 haters), intelligent enough not to regard horror films as worthless and contemptible, and are open-minded enough, you'll find ""The Unborn"" is worth a look.",1242518400,5,2395,4.6453900709219855

The makeup and effects were topnotch and the settings were appropropriately dark and creepy.  There are some heavy-hitting actors, tooGary Oldman, Idris Elba (who is being considered to play the next James Bond), Jane Alexander and Carla Gugino).  Parts of this movie were as scary as The Exorcist!  It is SO DIFFICULT to find a really good scary movie, and this is one of them (I'd love to give it 4.5 Stars).

This movie started off well with good acting, cinematography, and soundtrack. It also had some neat scenes with ghost hauntings, like when the main character wakes up (in a dream, of course) to find herself pinned to her ceiling as she watches her ghost brother assault a mirror image of herself by ripping a big hole in her uterus and thrusting his hands into it. It did become a little tiresome, however, when the sound level tripled during the monster-jump-out-at-you moments. Also, some of the ""red shirt"" characters became predictable, meaning it was perfectly obvious when someone was going to get killed.

But I can forgive little flaws like this. The unforgivable sin is when a story just stops making any effing sense. Here are Deena's and my questions. Anyone who has seen this movie, would you please enlighten us with the answers:

1. If the dybbuk can possess anyone he wants, and if possession is his goal, then why does he even bother with terrorizing Casey?

2. Since it is proven he can possess anyone he wants, why not just possess her unborn baby . . . the end?

3. Where the hell is her father during all this when everyone is dropping like flies around her?

4. When the dybbuk possesses the pastor, why does the pastor want so badly to kill the boyfriend and her? Likewise, when the dybbuk later possesses the boyfriend, why does he want to kill Casey? If it is his goal is to possess her unborn babies, then he shouldn't want any harm to come to her.

5. How did the exorcism finally work when it clearly didn't have any effect at the beginning and when they skipped the whole middle of the ritual?

6. How on Earth could having a twin who died when she was in utero suddenly cause Casey's eye color to change when she is an adult? Her doctor acted like this was a perfectly normal thing -- and for some unexplained reason acted like it was a threat to her health -- so obviously the sudden eye color change did not have a supernatural cause.

And finally, 7., Are we the only people who think that the actress's resemblance to Jennifer Connelly must have played a role in her getting this part? And, goddammit, why utilize Gary Oldman if he's only going to be a minor character? I mean, Jesus Christ, give him his wand back or something.",1377734400,,2279,4.512135922330097

If you haven't already guess the secret ingredient of a successful horror movie, I'll let you in on this secret - just get a sexy actress to play the lead role! Nothing else really matters much!

Here's a movie blooper for ""The Unborn"" (2009):

A faithless translator of an ancient Hebrew text turns out to be covert Jewish exorcist? LOL!

A multi-faith exorcism on a victim who ""isn't looking for a Christian exorcism""? LOL!

Does that boy spirit remind you of a replay of that Japanese female ""Ju-on"" horror movie? Wide open mouth that looks like it is looking for a pacifier as much as he needs to be drenched in Catholic Holy Water!

The lead actress is better seen in her jogging outfit and her night-time fashion, more so than her screams.

3757847,3,B001PR1ZNS,"I was attracted to this film for three main reasons: David Goyer being the primary, as I love just about everything he's written (not the least being his work on the recent Batman reboot); Gary Oldman tied for second with the featuring of a dybbuk and Jewish mysticism. As a fan of horror, I was glad to see a different presentation of evil. And to the reviewers confused on the actions of the dybbuk - they are a complicated entity in mythology, and I think the film did a great job utilizing them.

The bad part is that the script is fairly weak, and I HATE to say that because of my love for Goyer's work. I would not go as far to say that the acting was weak; it just seemed that they did not have enough to work with.

With the BD release, I jumped on the chance to watch the 'unrated version including some deleted scenes, but the run time for this new version was only one minute longer than the theatrical cut. Hmm. And there's no direct special features; you have to fall back on BD-Live.

In the final musings, like the title of the review says, an extra 15 minutes could have helped explain a lot, provide a few key emotional moments for us to like the characters. The music and the ambiance are still creepy, and the picture presentation via BD is beautiful and lends to the creep factor in key moments... there is simply something missing. We're left wanting.

5 - I really liked/loved it
4 - I liked it
3 - Could've been better/worth a look
2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

Why is David S. Goyer making PG-13 horror? This guy wrote the Blade film series (directing the third). Those movies were plenty bloody and had a lot more fun characters. I'm not saying PG-13 can't work, but most of the time it doesn't. This movie is just a shallow piece of drivel. Makes sense given that it was produced by Michael ""SPLOSIANS!' Bay. The movie kept promoting this as ""From the co-writer of The Dark Knight."" I know this will be considered a nitpick, but Goyer did NOT co-write the Dark Knight. Yes he co-wrote the story with director Christopher Nolan, but the final screenplay was done by Christopher and his brother Johnathan. Story and screenplay are two different things. This shows how desperate the producers are to get this movie shown because of course Dark Knight was a massive hit.

PLOT: Casey (Odette Yustman) starts seeing strange images of a ghostly boy. Another creepy boy that she babysits declares one night that ""Jumby want's to be born now."" She discovers sometime later that she's a twin, her brother dying in the womb (nicknamed Jumby by her parents). This is one problem with the movie (besides the many other ones) is the name of the twin brother. JUMBY!? REALLY!? That's is one of the least scary names I've ever heard in my entire life. In fact, I think that was the name of the genie on Pee-Wee's Playhouse? I could be wrong about the spelling of the genie, but the names certainly sounds similar. She figures out that she's being stalked by a demon of Jewish origins (a dybbuk) that wants to use her as a way to enter the living world.

The premise is interesting, too bad the final product sucks. I think the producers knew this and that's why Odette has scenes in tight underwear (not to mention the poster for the film). The acting is horrible. The only one really trying is Gary Oldman (obviously in this movie as a favor to Goyer since he did co-write Batman Begins, where Oldman plays Jim Gordon). The characters are annoying, especially the best friend character. There's some ""shocking"" imagery, but shocking doesn't equal scary. People seem to think that just because you have a kid speak creepily than it's automatically creepy. It goes for cheap jump scares and takes no risks. There really is nothing else to say.",1348272000,,2429,4.592165898617512

3757852,2,B001PR1ZNS,"Poor Casey (Odette Yustman Annable; And Soon the Darkness, ""October Road"") is having a rough week. Not only is she having strange dreams about her crazy, suicide mom but her nightmares are being invaded by visions of a demonic, long dead little boy. The creepy little boy she babysits is adding an extra dose of the creepy as well as knocking her upside the head with little mirrors while spouting off bad horror movie dialogue. And what's with all the strange knockings emanating from her bathroom mirror? And who owns that feroucious dog with the upside down head? And can someone call the exterminator to get rid of all the bugs that keep falling out of her eggs and crawling across her term papers? And who is Jumby?

Her friends are no help. Her dimwitted boyfriend Mark (Cam Gigandet; Twilight, Priest) would rather lay around in his tightie whities and express deep philosophical insights about how vast the universe is (hey, he may be pretty but he's no Himbo!) than offer any support to her. Her BFF Romy (Meagan Good; Saw 5, Eve's Bayou), who is suppose to be some sort of supernatural expert, is ready to have her commited. And her father is conviently out of town an no one has bothered to call him to let him know that his princess is in a desperate battle for her life and soul against a very powerful dybic (or a Hebrew demon).

But luckily for Casey she has her Grandma Sophia (Jane Alexander) on her side. Oh, wait, Grandma Sophia has been disposed of permanently by some double and triple jointed old guy in the home who can contort his body at wild angles and walk like a spider. So that leaves Rabi Sendak (Gary Oldman; Bram Stoker's Dracula, Romeo Is Bleeding) to connect with his inner Merrin and wage war against the dybic before it achieves it's ultimate goal of destroying Casey and being born into our world.

While it does sport so very impressive and, at times, very frightening visuals, it just can't erase the simple truth that this movie is boring. It's just one cliche scene after the other. So much do that it took me three sittings just to get through it. Yes I admit the upside down headed dog was impressive...the first one or two times. By the sixth and seventh sighting, I was ready to throw Cerberus a rawhide bone just to give it something more interesting to do besides snarl. The cast (aside from Gigandet who couldn't act his way convincingly through a Christmas play) does their best to lead us through this mess but even they appear to not fully know where the story is going. In one scene, after witnessing the death and reanimated possession of one of their friends, Casey, Mark, and Rabi Sendak appear in the very next scene at an all night diner acting as if nothing out of the ordinary had just happened. I, for one, would be freaking out and high tailing it to the first synagogue I found. Scenes like this play out all through the movie. The little boy tells Casey that ""Jumby wants to be born now."". A few minutes later, Mr. Casey's Dad tells her that she had a twin who died in utero and that his nickname was, wait for it, Jumby (dun dun DUNNN! Quite a twist, huh? Betcha you didn't see this little tidbit of info coming!).

While they had a chance to pull off a fairly good idea, the execution of it is poor. The whole Jewish folklore surrounding the dybic demon sounds incredibly interesting and scary, in the end the producers opt for cheap thrills and jump scares. If Jumby really wants to born now, surely he would've picked a better script to be born through instead of this one. I'm giving it two stars for a few reasons: One for the visuals and for introducing us to the Dybic and a Jewish exorcism and Two just for the fact that Odette Annable looks really hot in her underwear that she models a lot through this movie.",1345161600,,3783,4.478260869565218

She then finds out from he dad that her mom lost a son who died in the womb, so Casey believes this boy is her brother but what does he want with her? As she delves deeper into this mystery it becomes clear her brother's spirit wants to take control of her and get the life he was never able to get. She becomes more desperate to prevent this and the tension mounts into a dramatic conclusion.

As for the movie itself, Odette really isn't given much more to do than look pretty and scream when a ""scare"" is supposed to be happening. Gary Oldman is also in this as a Rabbi (but I have no clue why he was in this, must've been a contract movie or he owed someone a great favor).

I found myself excited to see aspects of stories I grew up hearing from my grandparents depicted on screen, albeit in a new and scary way.

My main issues with this movie lie with the acting. I found the two leads (Cam Gigandet, and Odette Yustman) to be lacking in this department. I did not buy their chemistry, and their ability to sell some of the admittedly hokey dialogue falls flat.

One interesting thing about the film is its cast: Odette Yustman, Cam Gigandet, Meagan Good, Idris Elba, Jane Alexander, Carla Gugino and Gary Oldman.

The several scenes of a canine with a human head, then an inverted canine head, and ultimately the possession of the deceased old man crawling up and down the steps on all fours were absolutely terrifying.

3757936,2,B001PR1ZNS,"THE UNBORN looks identical to many horror films of the past decade. Pretty but bland twentysomethings live in expensive surroundings, unencumbered by adults or adult responsibilities.  This leaves them plenty of time to ""hook up"" and text each other, and confront the supernatural terror without any adult distractions.

Yeah, they go to school.  Supposedly.  Except they're never in class.

The story and special effects are so commonplace, I instead spent my time picking out the flaws and clichs.

The old woman says that a dybbuk is a soul that's been barred from heaven, so it's trapped between the two worlds (earth and heaven).  This implies that it's a human soul, which is what ghosts are.  But later, a priest says that these dybbuks are evil entities ""older than any religion.""  That is, a demon.  So is it a trapped human soul (a ghost) or an evil spirit (a demon)?  THE UNBORN seems confused about its own premise.

This dybbuk only wants to possess the girl.  So what does it do?  It possesses EVERYONE ELSE around her (boyfriend, best friend, little boy, old man at nursing home), destroying them so as to ""isolate"" the girl and ""wear her down,"" to make her easier to possess.

Huh?  If it's so easy for this dybbuk to possess all the people around the girl, why can't it just go straight for the girl?  Why does it need to possess and destroy her friends first?

Here's a historical blooper: the old woman was the victim of a Nazi mad doctor's experiments on twins.  This makes no sense!  The Nazis were only interested in IDENTICAL twins (i.e., those with identical genes), but this woman's twin was a boy, so they were clearly FRATERNAL twins.

The special effects and premise have grown old.  The ghostly facial morphing recalls GOTHIKA, the evil child ghost (the dybbuk) recalls THE GRUDGE and THE RING, the overhead shots recall WES CRAVEN'S THEY.

That the exorcist is a rabbi adds little.  Curiously, the DVD box calls this character a ""spiritual adviser,"" as if the marketing people were afraid that ""rabbi"" might scare away people, although this was the film's only original aspect.

For some reason, although this exorcism calls for a Jewish rite, the rabbi (Gary Oldman) calls in his Episcopal priest friend, and people of other faiths, to help with the exorcism.  Why, is not made clear.

Gary Oldman's performance was fine.  I didn't see him do much ""scenery chewing"" as another reviewer said.  He got a little intense toward the end, but it was an exorcism.

There were a few good shocks, and the dybbuk kid was initially creepy (good makeup effects). But I found the girl, her best friend, and her boyfriend tedious to watch.  For some reason, the cast didn't engage me.  They just seemed like the same bland young folk who've populated much of the past decade's horror.

Young horror actors were more distinct in the 1980s.  Most of today's young horror actors look interchangeable, prepared by the same cookie cutter.  Pretty, but with rare exceptions, no charisma or uniqueness. Who from the past decade can compare to Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, Rebecca Balding, Barbara Bach, Tisa Farrow, Robey, or Barbara Crampton, to name a few of the horror actresses from 30 years ago?  For that matter, what horror actor today can compare to Jeffrey Combs, Ken Foree, or Donald Pleasance?

With the exception of Gary Oldman (excellent in the 1992 film, BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA), the cast of THE UNBORN is as forgettable as its story.",1283472000,,3464,4.810169491525424

In the name of science the Nazis decided to work on them and see if they could understand exactly what makes a twin ""tick."" This led to a lot of horrible things and a lot of grave with little names prined on them and for what - all to find the perfect race. In the midst of this testing, there was a test of sort which allowed a Jewish demon to pass into a dead kid. The result - a family that is cursed after the demon's ""twin"" kills it. In the darkness of the womb it has waited, firs tlooking into a mother and then a girl, wanting to be born.
and the things it can do - they are not pleasant when someone tries to thwart it.

When I watched Unborn, I thought this was the tale of two movies. It had parts in it that were creepy and parts that were not exactly friendly to the elderly, not to mention the possession bits and the tapes that were used as clues. This was the good stuff, and that was what earned it three stars. The rest of the movie was painful, however, as the watcher saw the movie being deconstructed piece by piece as the plot unwound and was thrown into a deep, depp hole.

There were other problems asw well - twists that wer enot needed, some acting ordeals, things that did not work together, and so on. honestly, it hurt to see that because the demon was a little monster when it wanted to be and a kid - a kid is something that can be creepy and then some. That was the goodies in the basket, the taste that was chocolate and not-so-yummy, leading a person perplexed and perhaps confused in some rights.
I personally wanted to like this but I, like others, just found too many holes in the fabric of the movie.

If you watch it, beware of it. It had a budget and good points but the bad places are really bad. And forget following the plot - it simply likes jumping around too much. All of that noted, however, I still liked it enough to see it more than once, hoping to make more sense of it.
and I didn't.
sadly, I didn't.

Unlike virtually every supernaturally-themed horror film of the past 40 years, ""The Unborn"" draws inspiration from Hebrew mystical occultism, and there's a degree of creativity in the presentation of the demonic presences that haunt our heroine. Actually, the twisted physical manifestations of the demon are among the most original this side of ""Pan's Labyrinth."" It's just too bad the script has contempt for its audience, tossing in poorly-developed characters and glaring plot holes. The direction robs the awful story of what little suspense it could have had. There's absolutely no reason to care about anything that happens in this movie and even good old Gary Oldman as a kind of Yiddish Van Helsing can't steal the few scenes he is in.

Jeez, there was three scenes where it showed her undies; if this were an atrocious Friedberg/Seltzer movie, there would be a dookie in her panties for forced laughter, and only the directors would be laughing.

Having one for this movie made so little sense.  The story details that an evil soul is trying to possess the Megan Fox-lookalike, because it only possess a twin and she had a twin brother who died in utero.  Later, it explained that her grandma also had a twin sibling, but it died during a bizarre Nazi experiment straight out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-America/dp/6302447739/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Captain America""</a>&nbsp;and the lost soul took over his body; that same soul, who got out of that body for some reason, wants to go after Yustman and is willing to kill her friends and family to do so.

Numerous questions had to be asked that the movie didn't bother to explain.  First off, why did it target twins?  If the lost soul existed and possibly possessed others before Grandma's dead twin, then why does it keep taking the form of that boy?  Doesn't it have an original form of its own?  It was established that it can possess the living and the dead, so why didn't it take advantage of the dead outside yelling at the screen?  If it can possess other living beings, then why bother going after the main lead in the first place?  Finally, what was the point of having that creepy neighborhood kid cursed his baby sister to death?  The plot holes are a nightmare, not to mention the plot itself is just convoluted and topped with a rushed ending.  David S. Goyer didn't seem to think things through when he was going through the filming process because the producers keeps persisting him to shoot more of Yustman's eye-candy takes.

On the upside, the production company Platinum Dunes actually made something different amidst their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/slew/dp/B00018D42W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">slew</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/of/dp/B000NO3DLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">of</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/remakes/dp/B001NPD9LS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">remakes</a>).

This film is awful. It has no clue where it wants to go and takes quite a lot of time getting there. The story is about young Casey Beldon (Odette Yustman). She is a girl in school, working as a babysitter for some extra money. This is when she encounters a four year-old kid that she is sitting who appears to be evil. Soon, she is seeing the evil of that kid in her daily life. To rid herself of this, she begins examining her family history. This includes a mother (Carla Gugino) who was depressed and killed herself, a mysterious old woman in her mothers photos (Jane Alexander) who has had issues in the past, and her friends. Upon recommendation, she decides to have an exorcism performed by the rabbi (Gary Oldman). If you are getting ahead of me in the plot, you've basically got it right in your mind.

The writing is mediocre, and that is perhaps kind. The beginning of the story is simply about showing as much of Ms. Yustman's body that can be allowed in a PG-13 movie. If that couldn't be done in one scene, they come back to it four or five times. The story follows clich after clich and takes forever to really begin. The frights are minimal and within 20 minutes I was laughing at what I think was supposed to be scary. This movie is unintentionally funny once you pick up where it is going and what it is trying to do.

The one minor redeeming factor of this movie was some of the camera work. There were a few angles that were used that felt greatly different than the others, felt fresh and felt well placed. Those few shots cannot, however, overcome some of the worst over-acting I've ever seen, a poor script, and a lack of direction for a vast majority of the film. If you are an absolute horror film junkie, go ahead and have a laugh. If you are a fan of bad movies, enjoy.

3757946,2,B001PR1ZNS,"Unborn is a thoroughly unoriginal horror film that pulls out nearly every overused horror clich&eacute; in the genre.  Spooky kid ghost, a rundown asylum...a crazy old person who seems to know everything...frequent frights in the bathroom mirror...It's all here and you've seen it all before.  Now that's not a problem if a film is done well, but The Unborn simply is not that film.

Pretty Casey Beldon (Odette Yustman) has always been troubled over the death of her mother who died in an asylum when she was just a little girl.  Now in college, Casey is haunted by the spirit of a creepy little boy and a neighborhood kid warns her that ""Jumby wants to be born.""  Casey learns from her father (James Remar) that she would have been a twin but her brother died in the womb.  The brother's nickname was Jumby...

An old patient who is in the same asylum her mother died in, warns her that she's being haunted by a Dybbuk, a spirit in Jewish folklore that seeks to enter our world through a host body.  Casey seeks the aid of a local Rabbi (Gary Oldman) to protect her from the evil spirit.

The imagery in The Unborn are things we've seen before in numerous horror films so lacking and creativity there we have to fall back on the story which is simply too weak to keep the film afloat for long.  The settings are confusing as in one instance the asylum is a bustling place still teaming with patients and doctors and yet later its all but abandoned.  Are we in a different wing?  Who knows?  Later, Casey goes to visit the old woman Sofi (Jane Alexander) well after midnight.  She simply walks right into the Psychiatric hospital in the middle of the night.  Is it a mental hospital or a 7-Eleven?  The ending of the film gives us a typical twist but it renders everything we've just watched pointless, robbing any sense of resolution.

Odette Yustman is a very attractive young actress and bears a strong resemblance to Transformer's star Megan Fox, but she's clearly in over her head in the lead role.  Gary Oldman is always fun to watch but is horribly miscast as a Rabbi.  The one element of the film that stands out is its exploration of Jewish mysticism and the Kaballah.  For a change the spiritual threat isn't a Christian-based entity and that was a refreshing change.

The DVD boldly proclaims that this unrated cut was ""Too Shocking for Theaters"".  And yet this version still carries a PG-13 Rating that's not going to shock anyone.",1269907200,2,2444,4.570114942528735

3757950,5,B001PR1ZNS,"Before watching the Unborn, I read the reviews here on amazon. Now usually I wait to read the reviews until the movie is over, but in this case the entire first PAGE shows nothing but opinions that the movie ranges from mediocre to downright terrible.

Well in my opinion, the Unborn is actually a fantastic horror movie that's honestly not as bad as I went in expecting judging by the reviews.

What makes the suspense work is the fact the movie actually *goes* somewhere. Sure, it's not the strongest storyline in the world, but then again, the same could be said for the Exorcist and that film is a classic.

All the acting is top-notch and believable, and the scares? Talk about tremendous! I haven't seen scares *this* believable in a long time.

This film is not quite just another Hollywood throwaway film. The Unborn does a really good job maintaining the spirit of the horror genre with lots of suspense appearing at the most surprising moments, and you know, just the fact some suspense APPEARS is leaps and bounds better than many other horror films out there that feel completely bland with no suspense anywhere.

My favorite part, without spoiling anything, is the scene showing an old lady at the retirement home, and while walking down the stairs in the middle of the night she sees a man crawling on the floor just behind the stairs.

When he starts climbing the stairs, his legs become twisted and he starts turning into a spider-like creature, while his head turns completely around like an owl. Alright, so describing this particular scene sounds funny, but when you witness the atmosphere leading up to this part, it takes on a whole new effective meaning of fear.

By the way, I know this scene was influenced by the part in the Exorcist showing the little girl crawling down the stairs.

Besides the Exorcist, the Unborn was obviously influenced by the Ring. Both films share a dark atmosphere which translates into a dark pictures (not *too* dark- just dreary enough to set the scene).

Both the Ring and the Unborn share another similarity- both films go with the mystery plot, and how the evil child that is tormenting the main character of the film appears and disappears at random.

The film shows this little boy quite often through the film, and what makes his appearances work is the fact he appears when you least expect it.

I don't know, I see a quality film here. I guess I look at the horror genre a bit differently than others.

I like atmosphere, lots of unusual events to take place that can't be explained with rational thinking, and a story that's easy enough to follow, all of which this movie has plenty of. I can't give in and agree with all the negativity.",1264809600,4,2700,4.649159663865547

I expected one of these ideas.

It could've been good, but nah, they had to ruin it! They had to come up with stupid sub-plots and ideas (like the dogs and the whole reversed head thing)!

3757952,3,B001PR1ZNS,"This movie has an excellent premise: the ""twin"" fetus that died in utero so that the heroine/main character could survive now wants its own chance at life. Perhaps bringing in the Jewish concentration camp survivor was a good idea; I'm not sure. It seemed to make the plot a little foggier. Had it been the spirit/consciousness or ghost of the unborn twin rather than a long-lived, erm, Monster-Demon? I think I'd have found it more interesting. But since they did go with a Jewish demon, and required a rabbi and a Hebrew ""exorcism""(Spoiler alert -- quit here if you haven't seen it and want to be surprised -- although after the first half hour surprise is unlikely)they should at least have done a few things right. Did anyone else notice that they read the secret Hebrew book from front to back, and each page from left to right? Hebrew, like Arabic, is written from right to left, and books are read from what readers of English and European languages consider back to front. OK, so I'm picky. But when the plot is thin to begin with, it doesn't take much to break the suspension of disbelief. That broke mine. And the ending? She's pregnant, with TWINS? Could it be more cliched? I think not. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't a scare fest. The best thing about it was that it relied slightly more on suspense and fear than slashing and splattering (the latter seems to require little to no plot at all these days).

3757983,3,B001PR1ZNS,"The horror film 'The Unborn' falls into the regrettable category; 'so much potential, so little realization'.

Just look at the positives:
1- Odette Yustman (does anyone else out there think she could be Megan Fox's twin sister?) was a great choice for the female in distress role.
2- Gary Oldman is one of the best in the business.
3- The decision to try something different from the overused Catholic priest/demon scenario and go with a seldom if ever explored Judaic mysticism/dybbuk storyline was genius.
4- The special effects were adequate and the film was overall successful in creating an otherworldly atmosphere that was both intriguing and believable.

So what went wrong? The first indication that the film was losing steam and direction was its inability to supply the audience with sufficient back story information on Jewish lore and the concept of the dybbuk. This blatantly missed opportunity to explore such a rich and obscure tradition was unforgivable. To be honest this omission may not be as bothersome to the majority of viewers, it just happens to be a subject matter of great interest to me.

Be that as it may, to a larger degree the storyline ultimately met its Waterloo during the exorcism sequence. I don't know what the makers of this film had in mind, but whatever it was the film lost all coherence at this juncture. Instead of staging a classic confrontation between the powers of good and evil they opted for a massive carnage scene which literally destroyed the continuity of the film and left the storyline and characters no where to go.

First off, it's obvious the lead actress was hired for her looks alone.  She spends most of the movie looking like she's not really present.  Her deer in the headlight look doesn't make her seem innocent, just vacuous.  She generated absolutely no sympathy from the audience, making the entire haunting just an empty exercise in CGI head spinning.

3758007,3,B001PR1ZNS,"The Unborn (David S. Goyer, 2009)

David S. Goyer directed one of those indie flicks that everyone kind of likes, ZigZag, but that don't leave them with much hope for his future as a director, if that makes sense. Hollywood co-opted him pretty quick, and his big-time output bore that out (Blade: Trinity, anyone?). So it was back to the indie scene, and once again, he's directed one of those indie flicks. But not as many people like this one. I actually like it better than ZigZag, but while it's generic and derivative, compared to most of the horror flicks I've seen recently, it's not that bad at all.

Casey (Cloverfield's Odette Yustman) is your typical American girl, save one thing: she seems to be haunted by one of those black-eyed kids so common to Asian horror movies. After a quick bit of detective work, she finds out that she was a twin, but that her brother was stillborn. She jumps to the obvious conclusion, and starts trying to figure out how to get rid of the ghost with the help of some of her friends (including rising stars Meagan Good and Cam Gigandet), a Holocaust survivor (Jane Alexander), and a helpful, if skeptical, rabbi (Gary Oldman).

I've said it before, very recently, and I'll say it again here: American attempts to make Asian horror movies fail because American screenwriters, or American directors, or American studios, or someone, fails to understand that Asian horror flicks (the best of them anyway) are so good because the creepy atmosphere arises naturally from the character development. We're stuck on the effects and the black-eyed kids. Because of this, our attempts tend to be mediocre at best, and this ranks right there with them. It does make me happy that we're trying, at least, because the American horror scene has been lagging well behind the Asian scene for a couple of decades now. When someone finally figures out how to put together an Asian feel, American effects, and a fantastic script to come up with a really successful film, I'll be thrilled. Until then, hopefully we'll keep learning from our mistakes. ** ",1248739200,4,2076,4.790502793296089

In spite of his heavy-handed touch, The Unborn works surprisingly well.  It's a creepy tale, full of nerve-wracking moments, which more often than not play like a true homage to the best J-Horror movies, and not simply as a failed Western remake.
There are some genuinely creepy moments, and they usually defy typical, logical explanation.  That's the essence of J-Horror to me.  Things happen, and they can't always be explained.

The heroine plays like a more thoughtful, better realized version of the typical Michael Bay / Meghan Fox character, and Gary Oldman does his usual fine job playing a role one couldn't possibly believe he'd be playing.  A Rabbi?

There are cliches abound in the script and Oldman's part as the Rabbi could've been played by anyone as well as fellow Brit Idris Elba's part as the minister--I guess they were both in for the paycheck.  The only pluses in this film are Jane Alexander's brief turn as the heroine's grandmother, Odette Yustman in her undies looking like a Victoria Secret's model and the excellent Blu-ray transfer.

3758034,3,B001PR1ZNS,"The Unborn follows Casey, a college girl suddenly haunted by a demon possessing the spirit of her dead brother, who died inutero.

While the movie gets some props for some genuinely creepy moments, problems appear within the first ten seconds. Normally, horror movie victims have a leadup or cause, but in this case, it goes: jogging scene, monster encounter. Some of the scares, namely those involving a rather bored looking pit bull, are bizarrely out of place. One of the scene monsters also was not even a rip off, but a Xerox copy of a monster from another movie.

The movie falls into the glaring pit trap of explaining virtually every detail of the ghost. And as most movie goers know, once you know what is slinking out of the darkness, it becomes as frightening as a math problem. This really wouldn't be an issue if the lead up to the explanation hadn't tried to be subtle, psychological, and cryptic. You genuinely would've thought Casey was going nuts if not for the blow by blow layout.

The acting is above average, and Odette Yustman was especially good lead, though her ability waffled periodically, though this is the nice of a bad director and not necessarily a bad actor.

Overall, this is almost a buy, but I'd still call it a rent, as its not got anything good enough to stand on its own. All the pieces are there, but enough of them are misshapen to spoil the puzzle.",1247443200,2,1389,4.588709677419355

3758036,2,B001PR1ZNS,"David S. Goyer had written the first two ""Blade"" films and co-wrote ""Batman Begins"" with Christopher Nolan so I gave him an excuse for his lackluster directorial efforts in ""Blade Trinity"" and ""the Invisible"". Now that was before I found out that Goyer is also responsible for the script in ""Kickboxer 2: the Road Back"". Certainly, one wouldn't be hard-pressed to think that Goyer is a either a hit or a miss after his less than stellar resume. He has written and directed his latest horror film ""The UNBORN"", and once again, I wonder as to what happened to the talent displayed in the first two ""Blade"" films?

Casey (sexy Odette Yustman) is experiencing several bizarre and unsettling dreams. What's more casey had began to experience hallucinations and she had come to believe that a child named ""jumby"" is a guise for a demonic force called the `Dyubbuk' and that malevolent spirit is after her. Casey traces the cause of the visions through the clues left behind by her dead mother (Carla Gugino) and had found that she is also the grandchild of a holocaust survivor, Sofi (Jane Alexander). Sofi had experienced unfathomable experiences as a child during the holocaust and she believes that the `Dyubbuk' is after Casey. The demonic force slowly becomes more powerful as people around Casey begin to die. Now it is up to her along with her boyfriend (Cam Gigandet) to seek the help of Rabbi Sendak (Gary Oldman) to exorcise the `dyubbuk' and send it back to where it belongs....

""The Unborn"" could have easily been mistaken for a remake of an Asian horror film; a creepy child--check, a pale-faced ghost--check, a family curse--check, a malevolent spirit--check. Yes, ""The Unborn"" has all the makings of a simple ghost story and David Goyer does try to go for a different route and adds several elements of Jewish mysticism such as the Kabbalah, family curses and even Nazi experimentation. The film does attempt to cover a lot of ground, that results in the film becoming a little too unfocused. Goyer's skills as a director isn't finely honed enough to pull off such an ambition and he is left a little lost within his own writing. I do commend the fact that Hollywood horror has tried to do something different in the film, rather than resorting to another remake; it also attempts to bring certain exorcism procedures into exposition than resorting to the usual Catholic overtones.

The problems with ""The Unborn"" are the fact that it throws in too many ideas but never really uses one as its central theme. What results is a screenplay full of gaping plot holes and too many variables that falter as a misstep. It also shows Casey trying to battle the forces of evil that feels like a minor genre implementation that ends up with the script becoming convoluted. It's not that the film made no effort to explain everything, it actually does but it ends up spending too much time trying to make sense of each of its plot elements that the film loses any of the `creep-out' touches it may have achieved.

The film is also co-produced by Michael Bay so expect a very visual experience that is a rehearsed practice of cheap and ""jump"" scares. The special effects do look very good and the film itself looks very pretty. There are a number of freaky images such as an old man crawling around distorting his own body, facial features are changed into something more feral and scary, convulsions and creepy mirrors--the film does have its moments, but the problem is the scare factor feels a little too cheap. The film suffers from visual overload, it is loud (not in a literary sense) with too much style that it forgot to become scary. Characterization is also a little too weak, and the viewer would have no time to get attached to its characters. Some may like the ""in-your-face-no-nonsense"" type of storytelling, but in a horror film, caring for the characters is essential. Goyer forgot to make the audience settle into his screenplay.

Goyer also leaves some grand behavioral missteps as with the character of Casey's friend Romy (Meagan Good); for someone who talks about believing in the occult, she sure spends an awful lot of time trying to convince Casey otherwise. He also leaves the subplot with Casey's child-stalker hanging out to dry and Casey's dad is curiously nowhere to be found amid the entire crisis (a simple phone call would've sufficed). Instead, the direction obsesses in showing a pale-faced deformed dog, more visual nightmares and an upside down senior citizen than developing the script. The acting is also a mixed bag and given the little elements the cast had to work with, I can`t really judge their acting abilities. Although I really liked the sight of Odette Yustman in her small shirt and panties, plus I did somewhat enjoy the fact that Gary Oldman managed to kick some dyubbuk butt.

""The Unborn"" throws in so much substance than it actually really needs. It resulted with the storytelling becoming a little too convoluted and the special effects just taking over that made the film rather superficial. While it does have some freaky images, they were all pretty routine and it offers nothing methodical that may make a scene really stand out--it all seems like a rehearsed exercise. The film is a grand exhibit of too much style and substance that never went anywhere. But I am pretty sure that ""The Unborn"" may find an audience, but hardcore horror fans are better off staying away. At least, Odette Yustman is very hot.

I enjoyed this film greatly.  The plot is intersting and there are the usual scares that jump out at you.  It does have a good cast including Oldman and Jane Alexander as a holocaust survivor who hold the key yo the plot.
The star of the film however is Odette Yustman, an absolutely beautiful young woman, sort of a less slutty Meagan Fox.  I previously saw Miss Yustman in Cloverfield.  However there she was surrounded by several other beautiful young women.  Here she has the field to herself.
I checked the time difference between the rated and unrated versions of this film on the DVD and Blu Ray.  The difference is exactly 1 minute.

I know that this film is written and directed by one of the writers of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, so you expect a lot knowing what great work he has done in the past. It's a good rainy day rental. Oh, I almost forgot about Gary Oldman. He probably did this movie because of his ""Batman"" relationship with the director.

There was very little gore in this movie but I think you find it wasn't necessary. It maintains a level of creepiness from the very first minute. Odette Yustman plays the young woman who is the target of a demonic spirit and Gary Oldman is the Rabbi who leads the failed Exorcism (does anyone think Gary looks remarkably like a young Peter O'Toole in this film?). I definitely don't think the film deserves all the negative critcism it received. Negative reviews tend to lower one's expectations - for me it was a pleasant surprise.

The Unborn has originality. It is cheesy sometimes but the visuals and the scares are really good. Theres good atmosphere and unease.

I have it on blu ray, which was overpriced (nearly 30 dollars!?) but I can't say it wasn't worth it. It's definitely a movie that you have to see on blu ray...DVD won't do it justice.
