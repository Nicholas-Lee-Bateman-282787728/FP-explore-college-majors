1795001,5,B00006WS7R,"This really was a helpful video on dining etiquette. Its interesting in that you go right into Ruth's house and use her silver and china to work on your manners and presentation. Now, my one complaint was that the bulk of the video was on how the fork and knife were proportioned, napkin placed, etc. I was looking for a bit more on hostessing and entertaining, etc. You get what you pay for---you see how to set a table for luncheon, formal and dinner parties. What fork to eat with, which glass to drink from, etc. I was hoping for a more well-rounded video on all topics, as well as a greater time length. But I feel I have gained something. Try to see if you can rent it from somewhere and save your money! (Library? Video Store? Used off Amazon.com?)",1060819200,19,755,4.361702127659575
1795002,5,B00006WS7R,We have enjoyed and benefited from Ruth Kern's video.  We have also shared it with our Chinese friends as they prepare for their diplomatic assignments in the United States. They are most happy to have such an educational tool.,1060300800,3,227,4.82051282051282
1795003,5,B00006WS7R,"I reviewed this video and realized that it has a great educational value to both the young and the old, both the natives and new immigrants, different levels of educational background and diversified cultures.  The trememdous success of this video in content and presentation has given me hope that we are once again entering a period of elegance and formality in our country which has been so desperately lacking since 1960's.  I would like to make a strong point about the social education to our coming generations to keep the good traditions, such as how to dining, how to attire, and how to make a formal speech, etc.  All these made US different from other cultures.  This tape would just meet this eduactional needs.  If any one, by any chance, were able to view this tape, he/she would benefit greatly from it.  The video is well designed and carefully photographed.",1060300800,2,874,4.793333333333333
1795004,5,B00006WS7R,"I grew up in a home where we pretty much ate everything with one fork and our hands. We rarely ate at the table.  This was fine until I grew up, went to college and married someone from a much higher economic level.  I hated eating in public because I didn't know what to do at the table or how to go about it without looking stiff and nervous.  This video was exactly what I needed.  I now feel comfortable eating in a fancy restaurant or at a formal dinner.  Thank you, Ms. Kern",1060300800,3,480,4.0638297872340425

7973325,5,B00006WS7R,Everyone should know how to eat at a table. I only wish that it didn't take so very long to ship smh the worst!,1446076800,,111,3.6666666666666665

7973327,1,B00006WS7R,"I HATED this video!!!  In fact, there is a video on YouTube by a woman named Nancy R. Mitchell called ""Basic Dining Etiquette"" that's 100 times better than this one.

I can list many problems but the main ones are the following:
--She NEVER gives examples with REAL food
--She's VERY disorganized in the way she presents this info
--She uses this video as an excuse to show off her house, and she does spend most of her time showing off her house
--A lot of her advice is not practical or relevant to business dining, etc.
--I don't agree with some of the things she says about etiquette, based on what I've heard from REAL WINE EXPERTS, such as when she says it's okay to hold a wine red wine glass from the top
--She demonstrates ONLY the ""American Style"" way of holding utensils, which even though it's an appropriate way, it is not practical.  At least the YouTube videos by Nancy Mitchell show the viewer both ways:  American Style and Continental Style

Bottom line, DON'T waste your money on this video.  :S",1309996800,4,1014,4.483695652173913
7973328,2,B00006WS7R,It's my own fault for not researching this more.  This is fine if you are wanting to serve high society but definitely wouldn't fly with high school students.  Decided to shelf this one rather than risk their rath and being forced to watch something that in no way relates to them.  Keep in mind I teach in a very affluent suburb of the city.,1298246400,,342,4.3125
7973329,5,B00006WS7R,My video arrived in outstanding condition in a timely manner. I would purchase additional items from this vendor in the future,1282521600,,126,5.0476190476190474
7973330,5,B00006WS7R,"I bought this for my little sister. She had no respect for food after having been in boarding school all her life. Its not like she had no table manners. Boarding school kids do a lot of food fighting and apparently, she still hadn't realized that a real world is judgemental. Had to bring her back to the family basics. Eating with style is fashionable. There is no reason not to have fashionable dinning manners. Its a valuable set of rules in life.",1267833600,,451,4.445783132530121
7973331,1,B00006WS7R,"I purchased American Dining and Entertaining Etiquette; Manners for the Table as a training tool for our young adults participating in our annual cotillion.  After previewing the tape, I am very disappointed.  Ms. Kern is quite boring and would not hold the interest of me as a 43 year old  adult. I would not torture our youth by forcing them to watch this video.  There was too much discussion on wine and where to serve the guest and no real demonstration as I expected.  May I suggest you redo the video and have actual people at the table.  Demonstrate how the table should be arranged, the place setting, etc.  Also consider showing real people having a meal utilizing the proper instruments. Include proper conversation and provide tips for various negative encounters (spill water or beverage, how to request additional food, what to do if you don't like the food on your plate, etc.) that may occur and how to recover from them.  Do a video just for young adults demonstrating how men should seat women, show bad manners vs. good manners, etc.",1245369600,6,1052,4.741758241758242
7973332,4,B00006WS7R,Excellent content but hosts clothing was a joke.  A little bit dated and over the top to say the least.  I could only get the VHS tape and the video quality was a bit grainy.  Another complaint is that the video shows people smoking at a dinner party.  Smoking is no longer acceptable in a lot of peoples homes.  I bought this for the high school students in my business club but I have to skip over the smoking and drinking parts.,1192320000,,431,4.2073170731707314
7973333,3,B00006WS7R,"The advice in this DVD is good: Ms. Kern spends most of the time filming a table, explaining in detail how to navigate your way in several table settings, what each utensile and plate is for, what is the correct order for glasses, how to hold the fork, etc. However, in that long sequence she is alone and the plates and glasses are empty. Thus, for instance, when she describes how to interact with the other guests at the table or deal with the food in front of you she is just describing what you should do instead of actually showing you what to do. Well a book can do that. I bought a DVD on etiquette expecting to see a display of good manners rather than, mostly, having them described to me. Nevertheless, I was not able to find a better DVD on etiquette so I would recommend this one.",1062201600,29,793,4.258278145695364
