It speaks to the fact that people, organizations, and the poor contribute to make this dream come true.  I loved the entire viewing, and I cried!  Those children's lives will never be the same; it has made a tremendous difference in their lives.  It will be interesting to see what the change does to enhance their lives, and what they will become. Most of these children have never been out of their district, let alone going to a foreign country.  They were well received, and loved by the people.  This was truly a dream come true...and the band plays on!!!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Wilson-s-Kids-From-East-Cleveland-to-Beijing/dp/B001NMT8K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Wilson's Kids: From East Cleveland to Beijing</a>",1257379200,,864,5.651162790697675
8327376,5,B001NMT8K2,"The truth of hope smashes through the lies of negativity and uncovers the magnificent beauty of youth rising to meet opportunity. Viewing it is like looking for Pottersville in a poverty strapped town and finding instead that it's really a ""Wonderful Life."" The professional quality of the production is equal to the international dimension of its reach.",1231718400,,354,5.228070175438597
