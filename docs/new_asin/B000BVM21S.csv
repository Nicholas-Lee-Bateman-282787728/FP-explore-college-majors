8093045,3,B000BVM21S,I love this travel series especially with Ian Wright. However This episode I was a bit disappointed with. I enjoy Ian's joking around and his humor makes the show but I felt like he did not spend as much time in Bucharest as he did in Budapest. The chances of me visiting a orphanage or picking grapes are probably not as likely as wanting to explore the charm and history of these 2 wonderful lands. Overall it was a good episode but not his best.,1503100800,,448,4.2823529411764705
8093046,3,B000BVM21S,I am a real traveler - I wanted more details.  Ian is entertainment.,1502236800,,68,4.230769230769231

The ""solitaire at the bar"" scene alone justifies buying it!",1402531200,,105,3.9523809523809526

8093051,1,B000BVM21S,"We just finished watching ""The Ian Wright Attempted Comedy Hour"".  What a disappointment!  We have watched this young man in the past, and found him an okay host.  This DVD is terrible.  Ian seems to relish visiting Florence looking like a cross between a hood, and a rag picker.  His behavior is terrible.  He is insulting, and crude, but seems to think this is quite amusing.  He is an example of what no country would wish for as a traveling representative.",1348531200,,460,4.604938271604938
8093052,5,B000BVM21S,Video does a great job of showing the realistic side of traveling in a country that is not westernized and the quirky bits of figuring things out in that environment. It complements this with interaction with locals that are known for their hospitality and beautiful nature shots that are breathtaking. Very informative and interesting.,1340755200,2,336,5.2407407407407405
8093053,5,B000BVM21S,"The train journey alone from Bejiing to UB is worth the price.  Ian is in great form, goofing around with his compartment-mates, and you get a good look at long distance train travel (the train continues on as Trans-Mongolian Express).

Looks like such an odd and interesting place to travel, they cover it well, and there is good amt of variety.  Couple scenes are really off the chart with Ian's weirdness.  Don't add anything in terms of travel, but damn funny anyway.",1307059200,3,471,4.7073170731707314
8093054,3,B000BVM21S,"Having seen the content of several other Florence/Tuscany DVDs (many of which clock in at 20 minutes or so total), I'd give this 5/5 for content.  Attractions in Florence, Carrara, Vinci, San Gimignano, Siena, Maremma, Elba, and Pisa are presented along with travel tips (mostly where to stay and how to get around, with almost no attention paid to where to eat).  Unfortunately, the narrator, Ian Wright, is so annoying I had to knock it down by 2 stars.  He's like Jamie Oliver meets Carrot Top.",1152316800,2,497,4.755813953488372
