188592,4,1572521783,"The teenage daughter of a woman running a financially-troubled umbrella shop in Cherbourg conflicts with her mother. The slightly older boy working as an auto mechanic at a garage is living with his elderly and sickly godmother, who has a young woman come in occasionally to take care of her, has conflicts of his own. He and the daughter meet and fall in love...but as expected, the boy gets drafted and has to serve in the military for two years with war in Algeria going on. They must separate, but will the romance last? Especially with the daughter unexpectedly pregnant and a rich man also desiring to marry the daughter? The movie has its dialogue entirely sung, and the sets are in very bright colors. Despite this, the characters and their interactions are all believable, and the story line, though not entirely predictable, does follow a logical path. The movie is basically a confection, but it works.",1509494400,,913,4.821656050955414

188596,5,1572521783,"Possible spoilers.  I remember seeing this movie for the first time in a tiny art-house just off the campus of the college I was attending.  While I was no stranger to musicals  my mother loved them  this one came as a bit of a shock.  One of my favorite musicals is West Side Story but as director/writer Jacques Demy says, it like all musicals feature dialog leading up to songs.  He wanted to make a movie with the entire dialog sung!  And he did.  So he wrote the script and employed French legend Michel Legrand to write the music.  One other problem.  None of the actors could sing worth a damn, so real singers were hired and the actors lip synched the words.  Surprisingly it all works.

Like an opera, Demy breaks up the story into 3 acts.  Act 1 is called The Departure.  Its 1957 and Genevieve (20-year old Catherine Deneuve playing 17) is madly in love with Guy (Nino Castelnuovo), a 20-year old auto mechanic.  He is equally smitten with her.  They gush over each other constantly whether eating, walking or dancing.  Genevieve works part time for her mother, Madame Emery (Anne Vernon), a widow and the owner of a chic umbrella shop.  She doesnt approve of her daughters relationship, even though shes never met Guy.  The fact that she faces foreclosure unless she can come up with a pot of money has much to do with her idea of the proper suitor for Genevieve.

Desparate, Madame Emery takes her prized jewelry in to sell, but the owner isn't interested.  But a young, handsome diamond salesman happens to be in the shop and agrees to buy it.  But Roland (Marc Michel) is clearly more interested in the beautiful Genevieve.  Alas Guy gets his draft notice and has to report the next day.  He must serve 2 years and at the time France was dealing with revolutionaries in Algiers, so its dangerous.  Guy also supports his foster mother who he calls Aunt Elise (Mireille Perrey).  Elise is not well and is assisted in the home by a dark haired beauty named Madeleine (Ellen Farner).  Madeleine all but drools over Guy, but he is too much in love with Genevieve to notice.  In the romantic closing scene of the first act, Guy must board the train leaving the tearful Genevieve at the station but not before they pledge to wait for each other.  The Oscar nominated song I Will Wait For You (Je ne pourrai jamais vivre sans toi), is featured throughout the film.  The song has been sung by just about everybody since and was a huge hit in the U. S. by Connie Francis as I recall.  I prefer the Lana Cantrell version but I digress.

Act 2 is called The Absence.  Although Guy and Genevieve promise to write each other, Guy seems preoccupied, perhaps with all that soldiering.  The night before Guys departure, he and Genevieve spend the night together and she becomes pregnant.  With daughter and mom becoming even more fraught with financial difficulties and Guys seeming reluctance to write, wealthy Roland is looking better and better.  Hes been after Genevieve since they first met and the fact that she is pregnant with Guys child doesnt seem to bother him.  He tells her, he will treat the child like his own.

The final act is called The Return.  Guy finally returns but no one is there to greet him.  When he discovers that Genevieve has married and moved to Paris with Roland he becomes despondent and finds his way to booze and brothels.  Aunt Elise who has been long ill, finally succumbs.  Madeleine is prepared to move out but, their eyes meet and plan B is in the works.  In a gut wrenching finale, years later, Genevieve pulls into Guys sparkling Esso station along with her 7-year old daughter who is named Francoise, the same name Guy and Genevieve had picked out when they were contemplating marriage years earlier.  It is quite a touching scene with hardly any dialog/singing.

The film is aided by some beautiful, colorful sets.  Stark contrasts of reds and pinks.  A collision of patterns seems sometimes garish but in a good way.  The musical score is genius and the work that went in to synch everything must have been laborious.  Not to mention the actors having towellact and sing even though their voices wouldnt be used.  This is a beautiful film that still holds up today if some of the plot points seem a bit of a stretch, especially Guys absence.

The Blu ray visuals are wonderful.  The transfer was cleaned up using a 2K scan supported by the Cannes Film Festival.  A new audio option includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  It is terrific.  Here are the extras:

Mille could follow the English subtext partly and at the same time listening to the singing in French. So I hope to look at this film (which Mille enjoyed) several times together with her and this way she will be able to improve her English and at the same learn a number of French words and their pronouneciation. At the same time she will learn about French culture and living and about the way of thinking in the late fifties. Mille's grandmother has an apartment in France so she has already some connection to France and the language. I look forward to see the film several times both for my self and for her!

188694,5,1572521783,"I was so shocked by this movie when I finally saw it last night!

First, the voice of Cathrine Deneuve was so mellow and soft that almost melt me to the water. I was so happy and expected this movie will never end.

Second,  I already owned most of the music composed by Michel Legrand which was a little surprise. The CDs that I have was mostly trio or quartet Jazz played by Legrand. I knew that he was famous but as seeing this film, I heard the string orchestra, horn parts added and the sound was just stunning. My ears were in heaven.

The movie was so so sad one. Especially the ending when two lovers meet agian after marrying to a different partners. They talk as if someone that they don't even know. And then the man especially when his family come back, he pretends that nothing happens and the camera goes high above them.

It just made me want to cry. I will use that moment some day for sure as a filmmaker.

Also the great thing about this movie is the phase of this film is so so very fast. One thing happens and the next thing comes along even before I notice.

Catherine Deneuve was wearing the thick makeup so I cannot tell she is really beautiful but her voice is something that I will remember for the rest of my life. It is something that I never heard in my life. If there is an angel that must be her.

All the rest of the casting were just beautiful.

The mother, Anne Vernon, was like late 40 but was really pretty and classy.

Guy, the lover of Catherine played by Nino Castelnuovo is good too. He is a middle class guy like and is also charming looking.

Marc Michel the guy who loves Catherine even though she is pregnent was a real something. He really sings well and he got this strange handsome looking.

There are so many memorable things to discuss from this movie.

The production design is purely stunning. They must have spent so much money to match colors for each shots. Pink, green, blue, red, and so on. They are so bright and make my eyes so happy. The wallpapers are so classy and artistic. Each rooms have it's own color and they are like one of those Dario Argento's movies. but of course not a horror way. They are so vivid and bright.

When the movie ended, I sit there in my room just tried not to be sad that the movie is finally ended. I wanted to watch it all over again.

I already missed it.

My previous best musical was <SWEENEY TODD> and <THE SOUND OF MUSIC> But maybe that was just changed. This one is just uncomparable.

I'm going to try to find the Michel Legrand's CDs, convert into MP3 and listen to them again today.",1458691200,,2580,4.2433537832310835
188695,5,1572521783,"The word ""Masterpiece"" is thrown about often in the worlds of film and music but in this case this is the real thing. The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is one of those rare instances where everything came together in a film in a serendipitous way that would never be duplicated. Not only that, but made by two up and coming young men who had only done two films before with a cast of  mostly unknowns. Then, to top it all off, it would not just be a musical, but a film sung completely through like opera, something completely unique and untried. Try selling a concept like that to one of today's studios. Fortunately the early sixties was a much looser time with many movie studios and open minds willing to try new things.

The director was Jacques Demy, whose first film, Lola (1961) included music but was shot in the more usual black and white. His co-creator was Michel Legrand, already known as a jazz pianist who had had hit albums and even toured America. The music would be light,, but not operetta; it would be updated to include strong influences of chanson, pop and jazz with a little Baroque counterpoint thrown in (Legrand had been classically trained). This time the film would be shot in super-saturated color with sets painted vibrant, almost expressionist colors. And it all would center around a young and virtually unknown Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo as Genevieve and Guy, the very personification of young love in a rainy Spring.

The resulting film is completely transporting. The story is very old, the treatment very new and the end result is something to be experienced. The singing somehow seems completely natural, more natural in a way, than films with spoken dialogue that break into songs from time to time. Here in a world of continuous music, love has turned everything into a dizzily colored poem that peaks when Guy is to be sent away to fight in the war in Algeria. Fate takes a big hand in the consequences creating unforseen results. The supporting cast are as good as the principals, with Anne Vernon (Madame Emery) the veteran of many films and Marc Michel (Roland Cassard) coming in having played the same character in Lola, a signature quirk of the director. The music produced two early sixties hits, I Will Wait For You and Watch What Happens. Mr. Legrand's familiarity with the worlds of pop and jazz kept everything fresh-sounding and up to date. You also note subtle touches like the opening jazzy music set in 1957 is very brassy and big band sounding while in the 1963 final scene it's the cool jazz of that time. The colors are so captivatingly brilliant  that when establishing shots of the actual Cherbourg are shown it seems like another world.

If you like romances, this is one of the classics. If you are open to musicals you will have no trouble with the fact that the entire film is sung. This is a most memorable and worthy film.",1454112000,8,2892,4.673870333988212

The narrative is deceptively simple -  among other thematic ideas, it actually has much to say about class distinctions in French society, particularly during the period in which it is set.

 I first saw this film as a teenager about 4 years after it was made. In those days, movie theaters commonly showed two films, a so-called second feature was shown first and then the popular film everyone wanted to see. My cousin and I sat down to watch and groaned at first because of the subtitles and all that singing. After a few minutes, though, I was mesmerized. I do not recall what the ""Main Feature"" was, but I never forgot Les Parapluies de Cherbourg. It was one of the first VHS tapes I ever purchased and, of course, I added it to my DVD collection when it became available. I am now pleased to have in in my queue in my Amazon Video Library. I have gone back to the Umbrellas of Cherbourg many, many times over the years for its visual and musical beauty and for its story.

The end of July, I received  a ""letter of greetings""  from President Kennedy,  and by the end of August 1961, I found myself at Ft Dix, New Jersey, enduring eight weeks of Basic Combat Training.  I might not have  been ""asked"" to serve, due to a very bad back, however there was a big to-do in Berlin and  Draft Calls had been Tripled, while physical standards relaxed, so that if you were breathing when you reported to the Induction Station,  you found yourself at Ft Dix that evening.  To make the story shorter,  despite my efforts, I  could  get no assurance at to where I'd be in December, so we cancelled our ""Big Splash"" wedding plans  and were married when I completed Basic Training,  which happened to be  October 31.  We had a Hallowwedding.  We had  some separations, but we did manage to live ""off post""  at Ft Benning Geogia and  a longer period in Orleans, France.

Described by director Jacques Demy as a film in song, the visually intoxicating The Umbrellas of Cherbourg pays homage to the Hollywood musical in this masterpiece of French New Wave cinema.

Guy Foucher [Nino Castelnuovo], a 20-year-old French auto mechanic, has fallen in love with 17-year-old Genevi&egrave;ve Emery [Catherine Deneuve] of Belle de Jour, an employee in her widowed mother's chic but financially embattled umbrella shop. On the evening before Guy is to leave for a two-year tour of combat in Algeria, the pair share a passionate night. Genevi&egrave;ve Emery becomes pregnant and then must choose between waiting for Guy Foucher's return or accepting an attractive offer of marriage from a wealthy diamond merchant Roland Cassard [Marc Michel].

Andrews Blu-ray Review: French New Wave auteur Jacques Demy described his 1964 film Les Parapluies de Cherbourg [The Umbrellas of Cherbourg] as a film in music. That is perhaps the best, most succinct way of putting it. Less a musical than a filmic opera, the dazzling pop-art in motion sings every piece of dialogue while telling its story of young love, dashed hopes, and the bitterness of thwarted dreams brought on by the class divisions of the bourgeoisie. While it may at first seem like a saccharine dreamscape in line with the sugar-coated musicals of Hollywood, one quickly realizes that The Umbrellas of Cherbourg shares much less in common with its American cousins, choosing to highlight the everyday lives of mostly ordinary people and steering clear of any elaborate dance routines.

The story is straightforward; 20-year old mechanic Guy Foucher [Nino Castelnuovo] falls in love with 17-year-old Genevi&egrave;ve Emery [Catherine Deneuve] who works in her mothers fashionable but financially struggling umbrella shop. The two star-crossed lovers make big plans for the future, hoping to be together forever, but when Guy Foucher is called up to the army to fight abroad in Algeria for two years, it puts a strain on the young couple. They make love for the first time before Guy Foucher leaves town and Genevi&egrave;ve Emery becomes pregnant. Distraught, she finally tells her mother, who begins to match-make and finds a suitor for her daughter in the wealthy young diamond merchant Roland Cassard [Marc Michel]. Roland Cassard is smitten with the young beauty and willing to marry her even if shes pregnant with another mans child. Now Genevi&egrave;ve must make a decision, wait for Guy Foucher to come back to her or not or marry the wealthy Roland and gain respectability.

Composer Michel Legrand composed the score that is modelled on normal conversation, no fancy rhymes or funny rhythms here. With this musical dialogue, the film glides by, in three parts, against a colourful backdrop of shimmering primary colours, soft pastels, and floral wallpapers with costumes that coordinate with the beautiful production set designs by Bernard Evein.

Combine with this free-roaming technique, with the use of unseen wheeled platforms to glide characters across the frame and you have a film that feels like we're witnessing a fairy-tale unravel. Whereas most musicals succumb to predictable levity and an obnoxiously jubilant disposition, time and space is orchestrated through the music employed in Demy Jacques's ill-fated love story and we find ourselves occupying an artificial world composed of oscillating scales and time signatures. However, behind the candy-coloured sets, warbled dialogue and the camera's pastoral filter, the posture and poise of the actors is remarkably naturalistic. Both Genevi&egrave;ve Emery and Guy Foucher are faced with a very real and fairly common dilemma and to fight for their love against adversity or settle for life's ballet of despondency. When this tragedy of young love has ended, one realises that it is a film of such romantic beauty and truth, of old styles and new coming together for something so different, that it really could only have been born out of the experimentation of the nouvelle vague.

Despite the film's incredibly cinematic veneer, Genevi&egrave;ve Emery and Guy Foucher take the practical option and burden this fanciful narrative with the quandaries of contemporary life. We're forced to question whether there is such a thing as true love, or is it merely a construct formed by society. This cynical philosophy ties in nicely with the ubiquitous feelings of national compunction linked to the unpopularity of the Algerian War and a sentiment that feels pertinent to today's despondent generation. Jacques Demy wonderfully captures the ecstasy and infatuation that accompany young love before building to a truly heart-breaking crescendo. The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is an elegant portrait of young love that swings like a metronome from ecstasy to sorrow.

This mature look at first love, without judging the young protagonists, is a welcome change to the portrayal that its the be all and end all, and even though the end is truly powerful, it is not sappy or overblown in the slightest. Even though every actor is singing their lines, they are all more than capable of having subtle nuisances that soon make the singing seem as natural as anything else. The jauntiness to the lines adds to the pacing, before building up to slower and more dramatic recitations later on. The gorgeous use of colour really explodes here, and once again solidifies the classical Hollywood feel that Jacques Demy was no doubt trying to recreate. Its something a little bit more than real, and yet the themes, situations and outcomes are heavily based in reality.

Now this scenario may sound familiar enough when you compare Umbrellas structure with the conventional Hollywood romance, musical or otherwise, but it is the ending that makes the film special. Convention would dictate that the ending would see Genevi&egrave;ve Emery and Guy Foucher inevitably end up together again, no matter how implausible that may seem. What Jacques Demy does instead, whether it is through coincidence and chance, those two staple themes of his oeuvre, or fate and destiny, is make sure that the couple are no longer together? He does not cop out and give the audience that happy ending they are all expecting but instead has the couple meet in a chance encounter at Guy Fouchers petrol [gas] station five years down the line. We quickly learn that both of them have moved on and that both are happy with their current situation. This gives the film a more moving finale. It is closer to the realities of life than anything that is thrown up in a conventional musical. Ultimately, we are left in agreement with Genevi&egrave;ves mother Madame Emery [Anne Vernon] when she says: Time heals many things, and I concur that 100%.

For some, no amount of praise is going to convince them to digest a film entirely delivered in song, and theres nothing wrong with that. You will certainly have to be in an accepting mood to truly become entranced by the whimsy before being torn apart by the bittersweet scenarios. But for those who want to see a meticulously crafted film that isn't afraid to be both fantastical and down to earth, then you cant do much better than The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Also a visual knockout is the film's wall-to-wall colour scheme, which presents a world where almost everything has taken on the most wonderful pastel hues. Among the things that are so coloured are the characters' clothes, the walls and furnishings of their apartments, even the very umbrellas that come out frequently in this very rainy town. The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a gem of a film, that reinvented the genre much like Moulin Rouge and Dancer in the Dark have done more recently. Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo are totally adorable, the score carries the film along in a delicious dreamy torrent of music, and of course, the colours are mesmerising. Its easy to see why The Guardian put the film as the Number 14 in the Best Romantic Film of All Time. It is ravishing to the eye and heart.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This beautiful 1080p encoded image quality arrives on Blu-ray from STUDIOCANAL and is taken from the 2013 restoration of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg done by DIGimage, with colour coding supervised by Mathieu Demy. The restoration was done in 2K from a 2K scan of the interpositive black-and-white trichrome, which is a three black and white strips representing Red, Green, and Blue, respectively. This allows for much more targeted colour coding and tweaking than restoring from the original negative. The end result, while ever so slightly leaning towards a bit of heightened graininess, is breath-taking nonetheless. The colours really leap from the screen and there are plenty of details and textures remaining in the image with lots of brightness and contrast as well. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The sound restoration for The Umbrellas for Cherbourg was carried out using the original 1963 mono mix, the 1992 Dolby SR optical negative, and the 1992 digital multitrack tapes. In fact, it is a recording of the score intended for release to stereo LP that was used, according to the restoration featurette here, that allowed for the audio to be Spatialized Audio. The audio, especially the music and some sound effects, does have a good sense of stereo imaging; however the surround atmospherics are very mild, almost non-existent and unnoticeable on the French 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. That does not take away from its enjoyment however, and it is a notch above the French LPCM 2.0 Stereo Audio  track, only due to the dialogue being better anchored to the centre and a bit fuller. Spatialized Audio is sound processed to give the listener the impression of a sound source within a three-dimensional environment. This is a more realistic experience when listening to recorded sound rather than via stereo. Because stereo only varies across one axis, usually the X, meaning the horizontal axis.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Virginie Ledoyen on The Umbrellas of Cherbourg [1080i] [1.78:1] [3:11] With this personal intimate short video interview, actress Virginie Ledoyen [In All Innocence and Farewell, My Queen] discusses The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and explains how the film has influenced her. [French with English subtitles].

Special Feature: Geoff Andrew on The Umbrellas of Cherbourg [2005] [480i] [1.78:1] [11:50] Here we have a very personal intimate video interview with Mademoiselle Catherine Deneuve conducted by Geoff Andrew, who is the Head of Film Programme at the BFI [British Film Institute] on the Southbank and a regular contributor to the Sight & Sound publication, discusses Jacques Demy's The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and explains how it differs from traditional Hollywood musicals. Mademoiselle Catherine Deneuve also talks about working with several generations of great European directors, from Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and Franois Truffaut to Lars von Trier and Franois Ozon; the problems of being a serious actress and a pin-up at the same time; and her fondness for rats. Geoff Andrew tells us that he hates using the word iconic when used to describe people, but in this instance we are talking about an icon because Mademoiselle Catherine Deneuve's face was used as the image of Marianne, and the French national emblem of liberty and reason, for the bicentennial of the French Revolution. She is one of the most iconic stars in world cinema, and a great actress. We also get to see some film clip, which includes Roman Polanski's Repulsion, then Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's Belle de Jour, then Francois Dupeyron's A Strange Place to Meet, and it concludes with Andr&eacute; T&eacute;chin&eacute;'s My Favourite Season. All in all this is a really fascinating intimate interview.

Special Feature Documentary: The World of Jacques Demy [L'univers de Jacques Demy] [original title] [1995] [480i] [1.33:1] [88:00] In a tribute to her late husband, Agn&egrave;s Varda the wife of the respected French director honours his life and artistic works by highlighting his vision in clips and interviews. Here STUDIOCANAL brings us a fantastic documentary film produced by Cine-Tamaris which focuses on the life and legacy of Jacques Demy.

[French with English subtitles].

Special Feature Documentary: Once Upon A Time ... The Umbrellas of Cherbourg [2008] [480i] [1.78:1] [51:52] Here we have this wonderful documentary film by Marie Genin and Serge July and focuses on the production history of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg which has a timeless appeal. It was great to hear how these two collaborated to create the film that just affected me so much especially with their goal all along. It was also wonderful to see Michel Legrand sitting at a piano while being interviewed, just popping out the tunes on request. The documentary is more broad that just those two, also going into the films place in the context of world events. The documentary also contains clips from archival interviews with Jacques Demy, composer Michel Legrand, director Agnes Varda, costume designer Jacqueline Moreau, director Bernard Toublanc-Michel of films Singapore, Singapore and Evil Pleasure and also actress Catherine Deneuve. [English and French  subtitles].

Special Feature: The Restoration of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [6:12] Here is an in-depth look at the new 2K restoration of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.

Finally, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg contains so many emotional, dramatic, cinematic, and musical riches that it is easy to see why many people consider it not only Jacques Demy's masterpiece as one of the greatest films, musical or otherwise. It reminds us that we  can mend our hearts even when they are at their most broken and although in many ways which we may never have expected, even as we hold onto our memories of the romantic fantasies which we left behind long ago, especially a very beguiling Mademoiselle Catherine Deneuve, a story of unfulfilled young love and class distinctions, and, of course, the radiant colours and marvellous, natural scoring makes The Umbrellas of Cherbourg a real treat to watch. Jacques Demys film gets a beautiful new restoration as well and looks as vibrant and colourful as ever. It may sometime be difficult to convince people to watch a completely sung French film, but they really should, as The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is one of the most enchanting films ever made. This 50th Anniversary Edition release looks really absolutely brilliant and is also packed with lots of added treats. Highly Recommended!

But if you're expecting a high energy musical like the best of the American one's from the same period you could be frustrated by this. There's no dance, it's through sung, and there are only two significant musical themes throughout the film, apart from the jazzy recitative, that older viewers will recognize. 'Watch What Happens' and 'I Will Wait For You', two beautiful ballads which were widely recorded in their English translations at the time the film was a hit. It's a lovely film, but the main problem for me is the dubbed singing voices of the female characters, which all sound the same, and are on the shrill side. It's very pretty to look at, the Bluray picture is stunning, and use of vibrant clashing colour is striking, although Vincente Minnelli did similar things well before this. But if you're patient, and in the mood for a French sugar overload, it will eventually charm you, and touch you deeply too. It's really a variation on 'Fanny,' but that doesn't matter.

Those who are not used to dialogue-sung type of musicals, be warned. If you like Michel Legrand's music, you're gonna love this. Peppered with jazz-up beats and painted with lush strings . Some familiar music you can hear in the film. And who does not remember ""I Will Wait For You.""?

There are some scenes though when some of the actresses could show more of their emotions in their singing. But apart from that, I love the story, the music and the art direction. You get to sympathize with Nino Castelnuovo's role who sung and acted very well here. It is not the usual happy ending seen in love stories.

188864,5,1572521783,"I am a big fan of the initial Jacques Demy film Lola from 1961 due to the great female lead star Anouk Aimee'  (due to her tremendous work in Fellini's - La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2). Earlier this year I found a DVD which is a continuation of her story by Demy where Lola is stuck in 1966 Los Angeles trying to gather enough coin by any means necessary to fly home and be with her son. Although the Model Shop film (released by Sony as part of their Martini Movies series) does not have the freshness of the original but it is not without charm and sustenance. It holds it own and was a welcome addition to my fledging  Demy  library.

Then the release of Demy's second film shows up on DVD - Bay of Angels about an ill starred couple whom tear up and down the French Riviera battling gambling addictions. Non stop action as Jeanne Moreau in one of her more captivating roles as a blonde, bewitched, beleaguered, and estranged wife from her wealthy, older husband. Agnes Varda has toiled tirelessly to resurrect her dead husbands films to much anticipation and joy. This is another great addition looking great in black and white, a camera that never slows, plus a story plausible and intriguing enough to keep you pinned. Terrific stuff.

How was I know I would strike gold and get a brand new copy of the best new wave musical to ever touch any shores at a smidgeon of its current market price? The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is absolutely perfect as a color pallet unrivaled ever in cinematic history. Mind you it is a musical from start to finish but deftly done in Demy's hands we witness the full blossom of Catherine Deneuve and terrific musical score by Michel Legrand for the 1964 Palme D'Or winner from Cannes. This is romance run away exponentially as only the French can concoct. It's a tad naive, but the beauty is so overwhelming I can't image a dry tear by films end. I can watch this over and over because it so surpasses anything Hollywood but does not offend their proprietary and lineage. I cannot recommend this film any higher. Its a 10/10 and no weak anything. Buy, rent, download, stream, whatever, but be ready to be captivated as we witness one the most beautiful women in film history transformational moments.",1344643200,,2228,4.518610421836228
188865,5,1572521783,"""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,"" (""Les parapluies de Cherbourg"") (1964), a tenderly told musical romantic drama, was, in its time, a great big immensely popular hit for Jacques Demy, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Les-Demoiselles-De-Rochefort/dp/B000MNOX4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Les Demoiselles De Rochefort </a>), who both wrote and directed it.  The French director created a singular cinema classic, a burst of color and emotion in which every word of dialog is sung, to an everlastingly beloved score by French composer Michel Legrand.  After Demy's rather early death, the film was restored in 1995 by his widow Agnes Varda, also a French director, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cleo-from-5-to-7-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780023234/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cleo from 5 to 7 (The Criterion Collection)</a>).

Beautiful Genevi&egrave;ve, 17, (Catherine Deneuve,LES DEMOISELLES )  lives and works with her widowed mother, Mme. Emory (Anne Vernon) who owns an umbrella shop in Cherbourg, a rainy coastal port. The young clerk and Guy, (Nino Castelnuovo), a twenty-year-old auto mechanic, who is always scented with gasoline, are in love and want to marry.  But when Genevieve tells her mother, the older woman objects on the grounds that her daughter is too young; and Guy, not mature or well-established enough, particularly since he has not yet done his required military service. Shortly afterwards, Guy is indeed drafted for his military service, to be sent to the Algerian war. Before he leaves, he and Genevi&egrave;ve consummate their love; she will become pregnant. While Guy is away they drift apart, and Genevi&egrave;ve, strongly encouraged by her mother, accepts a marriage proposal from well-to-do gem dealer Roland Cassard, Marc Michel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Trou-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005NFZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Trou (The Criterion Collection)</a>).  He has fallen in love with her at first sight and has promised to bring up her child as his own.

The film opens in rain, and it seems like it always rains in Cherbourg, evidently a good place to sell umbrellas.  The ancient northern city has always been an important port, fought over by generations of French, Germans, and English, and somehow, Demy shows us how beat-up it is, even as he gives us its cobblestone streets suffused in bright pastel colors.  Even the interiors are exuberantly colored; we see a lot of the green and purple combination made so popular by the waterlilies paintings of the French artist Monet.  The young Deneuve, an astonishing beauty, is never less than charmingly dressed, and pregnant as she is supposed to be, may still be the most gorgeous movie bride ever.  Mind you, even the umbrella shop, and Guy's garage are charmingly portrayed, and the quite pretty Mme. Emory, as portrayed by Anne Vernon, could have had no complaints about her wardrobe.

I have always particularly loved the Carnival scene, which takes place, of course, in the rain.  In this heart-breaking scene, perhaps an homage to the carnival scene in the great French movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Paradise-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005T30I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Paradise (The Criterion Collection)</a>, Genevieve decides that she must after all marry Roland.  It is also noticeable that every character in this movie is lonely.  Genevieve and her mother have only each other; her mother is the only person at Genevieve's wedding to Roland.  Roland has only his mother.  Guy has only his godmother, with whom he lives; young Madeleine, who looks after her, has no family at all.  Only Guy and Madeleine are at the godmother's funeral.  I wonder if this is a reflection of French life?

Thousands of words have been written about this movie's final scenes, which take place in a snowy Cherbourg, in December 1963, shortly after the assassination of American president John F. Kennedy.  Guy has his own garage, bought with an inheritance from his godmother, and is evidently happily married, father of a boy Francois; although he does not appear to be that well-off financially, from the numerous clues we are given.  Genevieve pulls in - simply for gas?--driving a black Mercedes, with her daughter Francoise.  Guy's wife, after doing the dinner dishes by hand, has walked downtown with their son.  Genevieve wears a mink coat - Guy's wife wears an old cloth coat; Genevieve wears high heeled sandals; Guy's wife wears matronly footwear suitable for a snowy walk.  Genevieve is wearing a lot of makeup, pearl earrings the size of dinner plates, and very elaborately done hair.  Guy's wife isn't.

But is Genevieve happy?  She doesn't appear to be.  Did she, who's never been alone, really send her daughter, after the autumn death of her mother, Mme. Emory, to her mother-in-law's in Anjou?  And, after picking up her daughter, did she really drive in the snow, from Anjou to Cherbourg, a five hour detour from the Paris road, as roads then were, simply on a whim?  No matter, Guy refuses to see his daughter and sends Genevieve on her way.

The camera leaves Genevieve, Deneuve, cold and beautiful, aloof and mysterious, as she always was and has been.  Critics have always said that her lively real-life sister Francoise Dorleac, who died tragically young, at the wheel of a sports car on the Riviera, was the only person who could warm Deneuve's affect.  But we here see Genevieve, Deneuve, accustomed to the uses of money, as she has become, and as we have long grown accustomed to seeing her.  Seems to me, neither Genevieve nor Deneuve were born to be lost in love and marriage.  She's simply too beautiful, and must exist in the public sphere, as Deneuve has.  Her image has been used in chic advertising for decades.  And it was used to represent Marianne, the national symbol of France, for many years, on view in every city, town, and village hall.  She's had children by two lovers, famous French film director Roger Vadim, and famous Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni;  has been married once, but has since said, ""marriage is obsolete and a trap.""

A show with a melancholy ending as both find love & goodness in life, yet it isn't what they foresaw for themselves in a time before. This is an ending that allows the viewer to roam the fields of memory for meaning. I can think of no better description than 'poignant'.",1294531200,2,1009,4.255208333333333

After becoming entranced with ""My Father's Glory"" and ""My Mother's Castle"", which are also movies in French, I discussed these two movies with another movie lover, and he mentioned the Umbrella's movie.  We both love languages, and when watching a foreign movie, the English subtitles are helpful and a learning tool.
I took only a year of French in school, became fluent in Spanish later, and the French was ""covered up"" by the other language.  I can listen to that movie and others in French and revive my vocabulary at the same time.

But I don't want to leave out the music...  What a great idea, the whole movie in song.  I love operas, but at times the recitives are rather dull.  In this movie the plot moves right along in a beautiful way, and holds our interest very easily.
My husband, who is a Western movie fan, even watched it and was taken up by it.

Such beautiful people, Catherine Deneuve and Anne Vernon. They seem to eat ponly carrots and lettuce and although financially hard-up, dress in such beautifully expensive clothes.
The story line has been described to death, so let me just describe the physical beauty of the characters, the sets and the songs. If everyone looked and dressed like them (I guess though that everyone will have to eat like them,) la vida es un sueno. Catherine Deneuve, like a flower, is blossoming into the beauty that she is. Anne Vernon,a mother is as chic and graceful as no mother can be. Marc Michel and Nino Castelnuovo are dreams. There is no Cantinflas in this movie.
There are musical scenes of particular beauty where you feel the music, the singing and the characters as they act it out, to be so good, that it touches you in the deepest part of your mind and emotions. The scene in the jewelry shop, which starts with ""What beautiful things..."" as jewels in a box are shown and in comes the most beautiful jewels, Catherine and Anne. The poignant scene of departure which has become a hit song, translated as ""If it takes forever, I will wait for you."" And a softly shimmering song where the jeweler sings of a prior love named Lola, ""Autrefois...""
The movie is a beautiful gem that will fascinate and satisfy you in all its color,music and the physical beauty of the characters. I only wish I was in that movie and looked like any of them. Unfortunately, I am real life, but then, that's why we go to movies.",1261094400,,1656,4.594594594594595
188900,5,1572521783,"A quick bit of personal history: I first saw this in May 1996 theatrically, in a newly-restored print.  It was about a month after breaking up a 6-year relationship which I didn't want to end, though I should have. She was probably the least-romantic person I've ever met - not that she didn't have ""romantic"" notions in the larger sense, nearly everyone does, but the romantic part of relationships she didn't get. Or her idea of romance was just so remote and unexplainable that I could never figure it out, and she could never have told me.  Why it took us 6 years to know for sure that we weren't meant for each other, I'll never know.

She probably hated this film.

I, on the other hand, am as enraptured by it now as I was on that first viewing 13 years ago and the couple of times in between.  From the first shot of the harbour of Cherbourg panning gracefully down to an overhead shot of candy-colored umbrellas in the rain, to the final mirroring shot of an equally artificial-looking Esso station in the snow five years later, it's pure sentimental, stylized magic.

Some have mentioned that there isn't much in the way of character development in this admittedly very simple story of young lovers parted by war and ultimately finding new relationships and lives apart from each other - but I think they're missing the point. It's not supposed to be terribly real, or rather it is suffused throughout with a sense of heightened reality, exemplified most obviously in the entirely sung dialog and in the brightness of the color scheme, but also in the intensity of emotions that could, after all, be experienced by any of us. It doesn't matter that I don't really ""know"" Genevive or Guy - they are any young lovers and what the film is about, it seems to me, is that bittersweet feeling we all have towards our first loves. At the end of the film, both are married and it is fairly clear that they have made the right choices - one thing I find fascinating is that the two leads are both rather weak and passive, and in both cases they end up with stronger, more aggressive and more competent partners. Had they ended up with each other, what kind of future would they have had?

The music - well, you can't take the music out, or it does, in fact, show its thinnness. Here's a great quote from Jonathan Rosenbaum's long review regarding composer Michel Legrand's contribution to the film:

""Though Legrand isn't credited as the film's cowriter, his collaboration with Demy, who wrote the lyrics, suggests that he may well deserve to be, for this is a film in which the score and the narrative are inseparable, shaped to the same architecture. Demy once noted that Umbrellas should be described as a film ""in song"" the way that some films are 'in color'.""

If one can't get past the notion that this is, in fact, a romantic fantasy amped up to the nth degree through color, through its plot absurdities (one night of passion resulting in Genevive having to marry the diamond merchant, Guy's beloved godmother dying on the same day he learns of Genevive's marriage and quits his job, etc) and most of all through the hyper-romantic music which runs the gamut from jazz to chanson, then there's not much I can say.  You have to fall under the spell and take it as it is, not ask for what it doesn't provide - asking for more realism in the relationships seems to me to be missing the point.

For me the only real flaw in the film at all is Deneuve - not at all bad, but at 21 she really is a little too old for the naivete of Genevive; this though is a very minor point in a film that I can never grow tired of.  I like Demy's next musical, THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT, possibly even more -- and I'd suggest all who love this to make that a priority. All who hated this of course should avoid it like the plague, unless they can find a way to put themselves under the spell that they somehow missed in watching this sublime confection...",1258761600,3,3946,4.457697642163661

188922,5,1572521783,"A semi followup to Jacques Demy's Lola - both Michel Legrand's main theme and Marc Marcel's character return - The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is surprisingly upbeat despite its subject matter. A traditional lost love story set against the backdrop of the Algerian War that separates the lovers, it opts for a less than traditional realistic ending that shows how their lives change, not necessarily for the worse, after they are parted. It's last act is darker than people give it credit, dealing with the young hero's disillusion on his return, oddly enough made more affecting by the triteness of what precedes it. While shot in some of the most glorious colour imagery ever seen, the dialogue is little more than sung banalities, whether it's a declaration of undying love or an extra asking where the paint shop is, which somehow grounds it. Even the location of the finale, an Esso filling station, is ultimately mundane, yet somehow becomes a gloriously romantic location for a wistfully bitter parting.

Documentary The World of Jacques Demy aka L'Univers de Jacques Demy, Agnes Varda's second film about her husband (after her semi-fictionalised film about his childhood, Jacquot de Nantes), available separately in the States but handily included on the 2-disc UK PAL version of Cherbourg, eschews a chronological approach for a more scrapbook like amble through his career, which is one way of avoiding the inevitable decline of his career and ending on a high. Utilizing archive interviews, on-set footage, reuniting co-stars and hearing from fans (mostly teenage girls), surprises abound, such as footage of Demy and Harrison Ford hanging around while shooting tests for his forgotten US sequel to Lola, Model Shop (Ford was replaced by Gary Lockwood at the studio's insistence Ford would never be a box-office star) or a chubby Jim Morrison visiting the set of Peau D'Ane. While it offers ample inadvertent examples of why much of his post-60s work was less than successful - many of the more obscure films look simply awful - it does make you want to see the odd lesser-known work like the surprisingly dark looking The Pied Piper, and the 90 minutes pass surprisingly easily.",1247443200,,2186,5.055401662049862

A must for French language hobbyists as well. The musical score by Michel Legrand is gorgeous and has been a favorite of mine. He also did the haunting score for ""Wuthering Heights"", 1970 with the incredible Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff.
The movie ""Fanny"" 1962? with Leslie Caron and Maurice Chevalier is a heartwarming, enchanting look at the same basic storyline set in an earlier time period. It is not a musical.

188926,5,1572521783,"Watched this the other day for the first time in years.  Deneuve (nee Dorleac, sister of Francoise who died much too young) is incredibly cute and adorable and Legrand's tunes are effective.  So what's the problem?  Call me a contrarian but when you come right down to it, things don't quite add up, or, rather, they add up to a less than pretty picture.

Genevieve becomes pregnant with Guy's child, off he goes to war (Algeria) and she ... well ... how to put this ... slowly forgets her love for him and does the practical thang and ... marries the wealthy jewelry dealer dude who loves her but not vice-versa.  Say what?  Guy comes back from the war, sees that Genevieve married someone else, and marries sweet, lovely Madeline who loves him but not vice-versa.

So, two people start out in love only to end up marrying people they don't love.  Yes, life can be like that, but the message that comes across is that it's all Genevieve's fault for not having the fortitude and faith to wait for her guy Guy.  She forgets all about being pregnant with Guy's child and gets ... practical, when all she has to do is wait a couple of years.  Huh?

What was Demy thinking blaming the woman?  This isn't just any woman.  It's the beautiful, sweet, adorable, Chanel #5 Catherine Deneuve, who I'm absolutely positively sure can do no wrong.",1237766400,,1334,4.531380753138075

This is a genuinely beautiful film but, for all its beauty, it is at the same time realistic and perhaps even cynical.  It is, in fact, a deconstruction of the classic romantic fable.

 The 16 y.o. Genevieve, who is about to be separated from her boyfriend, the garage mechanic, Guy, because of the Algerian War, sings a haunting tune that includes the lyrics... 'If it takes forever I will wait for you...'  Forever?  Well, maybe not.  Genevieve, confronted with an unexpected pregnancy and a Guy who seldom writes, soon turns to the thoroughly likeable and generous and well-to-do Roland Cassard, who loves Genevieve and wants to marry her despite the fact that she is pregnant.  Encouraged by her mother Genevieve turns to him and, together, they plan for the arrival of 'their child'.

Guy, injured by a grenade shell fragment, returns to find that his girlfriend and child now belong to another.  No, I won't attempt to tell the whole story.  See it yourself and you won't be disappointed.

For all the beautiful characters, perhaps the most wonderful and genuinely decent person is Madeleine who is in the background for most of the film.  Despite Catherine Deneuve's [Genevieve's] vulnerability and delicate beauty, Madeleine...for me, at least...was the real star.

Fortunately for her, Guy recieves his draft notice and will be away for two years. After a tearful goodbye, Guy reluctantly leaves with the promise of Genevive's hand when he returns.

Another way in which ""Umbrellas"" is unique is that it does not try to opt for easy answers.

188965,5,1572521783,"A wonderful musical film from Jacques Demy. Set in a fantasy Cherbourg (a French seaside town famous for its rainy weather) during the late 50s and going on for several years, it consists in three acts. First act: Genevieve (a very young Catherine Deneuve) is a teenager living with her mother, with whom she works in a shop that sells umbrellas. She fells in love with Guy (a car mechanic, played by Nino Castelnuovo), who is only a little older than she is. Her mother opposes the romance, as she sees Genevieve as too young and Guy as too poor. Guy is drafted to the Algerian war for two years, but not before leaving Genevieve pregnant. Act two: Genevieve's mother not only has now an unwed pregnant daughter, but the financial situation of her shop is dire. Fortunately for her, a diamond dealer in love with Genevieve agrees to pay her debts. He wants to marry Genevieve (despite being pregnant with other man), and eventually Genevieve will agree. Third Act (SPOILERS AHEAD): Guy returns from the war with a limp in one of his legs. He goes to Genevieve's shop, but sees that mother and daughter have gone. He becomes bitter, is soon fired from his job. His beloved aunt dies, and after that, he marries her caretaker, Madeleine. With his aunt's legacy, he is able to buy a gas station. He and Madeleine have a boy. Final Scene: Christmas Eve. Genevieve, now married and with a daughter, arrives with her car to Guy's gas station. Surprised to see each other, they decide to go inside the station to talk, but they both soon realize that their relationship belongs to the past. She goes away, and soon Madeleine and their boy arrive, and they celebrate Christmas by throwing each other snow balls. End of movie. All this is done through sung lines (rather than songs proper). It's an extremely entertaining and amazingly fluid movie, despite not having the traditional happiness of musical movies. Demy tried to repeat the magic a few years later with Les Demoiselles de Rochefort (also with Deneuve), but he couldn't; that's a much weaker movie.

188966,4,1572521783,"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (Jacques Demy, 1964)

I'll start this review off by saying that, for the most part, I loathe musicals. I've seen one or two over the course of my life that I would watch more than once. That said, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is not your momma's musical (well, since it's now over four decades old, it's actually your grandma's musical), and in one quick decision, Demy eliminated the one thing that drives me up the wall most about musicals-- the situation of people suddenly breaking into song while otherwise trying to be realistic. Here, every line of dialogue is sung, and it gives the movie a much smoother feel.

The story follows young lovers Genevieve (the great Catherine Deneuve) and Guy (Nino Castelnuovo, who got his greatest American exposure in this film), determined that their love will last forever despite the meddling of Genevieve's mother and Guy's impending service in the French war against Algeria. Just before Guy leaves for the front, Genevieve becomes pregnant, and things get more complicated...

Why is it that films made in countries other than America are so much better at examining human emotions than films made here? Whatever the reason, I'm thankful someone does it right. The Umbrellas of Cherbourg presents its situation, presents its characters, then sits back and lets them work it out for themselves. Despite the unreality of the setting, the characters themselves react just as you'd expect them to. There's never a feeling that something got forced in because a muckety-muck at a studio (or, worse, a test audience) thought it should. You forget how nice that is, when you have a steady diet of American movies on your plate.

That alone would make this movie well worth your time, but there's also the spectacle of a nineteen-year-old Catherine Deneuve singing. It doesn't get much better than that. The supporting cast all do their jobs quite wonderfully as well, and the technical aspects of the film are also quite nice; the cinematography and set design work on the American ""garishly-colored-musical"" formula, but never get overwhelming (except, arguably, in the opening credits).

It makes life so much better even though life is not always so perfect and yes, very sad too often.  If it hadn't been for that war, Guy and Geneveieve might have made it.  War - what is it good for?  Absolutely nothing.  Not for the everyday people, that's for sure.",1182038400,2,845,4.712328767123288
188969,5,1572521783,"I admit to some trepidation when I hit the ""Play"" button on the remote. I had seen Demy/Legrand's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Young-Girls-of-Rochefort/dp/B000062XI7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Young Girls of Rochefort</a>&nbsp;a few weeks earlier and found it tedious. Plus, will I like a film that is entirely sung, like an opera? Plus, many (or all) the actors were dubbed by European pop singers who possessed flimsy voices (based on the fragments I've seen over the years).

What can I say? I got caught up and carried along to the end - by the star-crossed-lovers plot - by Michel Legrand's glorious music -  by director Jacques Demy's and cinematographer Jean Rabier's vibrant visuals - by the the highly appealing cast. Under those circumstances, the singing voices were easy to get used to and, occasionally, they would show a pleasing brilliance of tone.

I can't help revealing the amusing moment when the mother tells her teenaged daughter, ""No, you're not ugly. You're not the fairest of them all..."". That daughter was played by the young Catherine Deneuve. However, gorgeous as Deneuve was, I would have gone for the brunette played by actress Ellen Farner. I was bummed to learn that that beauty appeared in only 3 movies (the other 2 may be obscure and unavailable German films).

There's a documentary on Jacques Demy on the DVD which states that Demy was influenced by American musicals. However, with UMBRELLAS, Demy took his own route. This story is far more sophisticated, even daring to end on a beautifully understated scene. The libretto (like that of most operas and operettas) is very sentimental and only the opera format keeps it from being sickly saccharine. It all adds up to something unique and daring -- and worth a try by someone looking for a new film experience.",1180742400,3,1852,5.2677966101694915
188980,5,1572521783,"A semi followup to Jacques Demy's Lola - both Michel Legrand's main theme and Marc Marcel's character return - The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is surprisingly upbeat despite its subject matter. A traditional lost love story set against the backdrop of the Algerian War that separates the lovers, it opts for a less than traditional realistic ending that shows how their lives change, not necessarily for the worse, after they are parted. It's last act is darker than people give it credit, dealing with the young hero's disillusion on his return, oddly enough made more affecting by the triteness of what precedes it. While shot in some of the most glorious colour imagery ever seen, the dialogue is little more than sung banalities, whether it's a declaration of undying love or an extra asking where the paint shop is, which somehow grounds it. Even the location of the finale, an Esso filling station, is ultimately mundane, yet somehow becomes a gloriously romantic location for a wistfully bitter parting.

Taken from the restored version of the film, the DVD also includes an extract from Agnes Varda's documentary The World of Jacques Demy dealing with the making of the film.",1179532800,2,1178,4.979695431472082

I am very happy to own this one, and am excited to show it to my friends who are not philistines(sadly too few).",1179100800,5,400,3.9382716049382718
188982,4,1572521783,"I first saw this movie in high school French class back in the 70s. Can't say I remembered much of it except the famous song and the image (though not the contents) of the final gas station scene. Course, our French teacher probably didn't let us see subtitles, so I'm guessing I really didn't understand most of it anyway.

Got it on a lark recently to watch again and found it very touching, and beautifully filmed, if a tad melodramatic.  By coincidence, I watched the ""Young Girls of Rochefort"" a while back, made by the same director and also starring Deneuve. Actually, I think I preferred ""Rochefort,"" but both are worth watching.

The simple story is told in a straight-forward way, a fact that is masked by having all the dialogue sung.  The ending is not what you expect, really, with both characters appearing colder and harder than a typical romance might have them be. Still, the movie is better because of this, more moving and realistic.  And each scene is lovingly and gorgeously put together, so its a feast for the eyes.  The ears---not so much. I found the women's voices harsh at times, hitting high piercing notes that grated.  Still, the score is pleasant and--though it may be overused a bit--the famous song a joy to hear.",1174867200,2,1246,4.662100456621005
188983,5,1572521783,"What I said above just occurred to me, this film meets the definition of an opera, since every word of the script is sung, and entirely in French at that, so be prepared to read subtitles all the way through, or at least bone up on your high school franais. But let me promise you something else, Umbrellas of Cherbourg is so lovely a picture, you won't mind the effort it requires to see it through.

Let me first compliment the restorers who recently returned this enchanting motion picture to its full colorful glory with its pastels and washes of bright hues. (I swear, there's something about candy-esque colors like that, soft and bright at the same time, that activates the emotion centers of the brain.) Secondly allow me to note this is the sort of movie that could probably only have been made in the 1960's, when the era of the great musicals had had faded but not totally lost all appeal, and the climate was welcoming of artsy experiments in stylistic film presentation.

Umbrellas of Cherbourg concerns the  romance between sixteen-year-old Genevive, played by the glowingly beautiful Catherine Deneuve---soon to be launched into international super-stardom by her performance here---and Guy, a slightly older auto mechanic, whose ambitious hard-working nature hides the spirit of a romantic tinged with an undispelled sense of realism. Genevive lives with her mother who operates a shop called Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Genevive is happy, but a dreamer, and very much infatuated with Guy, who is if anything (as events later show) even more in love with her. Their love, while momentarily deep, is not given long to flourish, as Guy is conscripted into the army to serve in France's brutal war in North Africa. Finding herself alone and with child, Genevive makes a decision that is either pragmatically mature beyond her years, or faithless, depending on how it is viewed. Umbrellas of Cherbourg concludes with a bittersweet irony that lingers indelibly in memory, and contrasts with the intense ""gaiety"" of the bright scenery ever-present throughout its run-time.

Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a classic. It was reportedly among the first modern films to draw crowds back again and again, and still remains a movie often noted as among the lifelong favorites of the generation that came of age around the time of its 1964 release. With its painstaking restoration impressively complete, there has never been a better reason to see it for the first time, or the first time in years.",1172620800,2,2493,4.985576923076923

188985,5,1572521783,"Believe it or not, I just saw this movie on TCM for the first time!  How it fell through the cracks I don't know.  I don't know that I would call it a musical in the Hollywood sense, but it is a stunning piece of cinema.

I first heard Michel Legrand's wonderful music on the 1954 LP ""I Love Paris"", the best recording of Parisian music ever made.  The title song, Mademoiselle de Paris, Sous les ponts de Paris, The Last Time I saw Paris, and a jazz version of La Vie en Rose in slow 4/4 time (which would have been better if it had been done without the violins) are given definitive arrangements. Legrand's beautifully orchestrated and melodically rich music for the movie is just as wonderful.

I have never seen a more beautiful woman than Catherine Deneuve.  She was 19 when this movie was made in 1964, and has a classic beauty which she has retained to this day.  The story is charming, sad, serious and entirely believeable, unlike most stories for musicals.  The cast and Demy's direction are excellent.  I wonder if the actors did their own singing or were they dubbed?  None of the reviewers have mentioned this.  I hope the DVD notes, if any, will have the answer to that question.

Interesting little ""extra"" on the DVD.  I don't know exactly when the major stars were interviewed, but it seemed to be recently.  The stars have aged well, I would still recognize them after 42 years.  La Deneuve, of course, is still so beautiful it is not to be believed.

LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG does not take place in Hollywood or Paris or a magical kingdom but in an ordinary seaport, transformed into the miraculous by the eyes of its characters who repeatedly find enchantment in the everyday world: young love, a kind offer of financial assistance, a chance re-encounter can all change the dullest of surroundings into the extraordinary. The stunning wallpapers that so often form the backdrop to this sung-through film (the famous delicate rhapsodic music is by Michel Legrand) perfectly capture this singular quality of the film. A very young, very fragile Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo are the starcrossed young lovers; the marvelous Anne Vernon plays the heroine's complex mother; Marc Michel plays an adult version of the same character he played in Demy's LOLA (and is given the most gorgeously melancholic of the film's themes); Ellen Farmer, as Madeleine, is, if possible, even more exquisite than Deneuve.",1165881600,4,1104,5.38728323699422

After some searching, I was fortunate to acquire the magnificent double-cd import soundtrack of
""Umbrellas"" by the brilliant composer of it, Michel Legrand. The young and ravishingly gorgeous
Catherine Deneuve has never looked so beautiful as she does here. A breathtaking, flawless in-
credibly cool film. EVERY single word is sung, and it WORKS!! I never tire of watching ""The Um-
brellas of Cherbourg"".  I still have my laserdisc copy of this, and even still play it now and then
along with the dvd. Cinema and art at its finest from French director Jacque Demy, winning the
1964 Cannes Film Festival Grand Prize. One of the most emotionally romantic movies ever made.
For even  more fabulous work from Demy, Legrand, and Deneuve, check out ""The Young Girls of
Rochefort"" from 1967 - another French musical masterpiece that also includes Gene Kelly in a
starring role. Tragically, Deneuve's real-life sister, Francoise Dorleac, who plays her twin in ""The
Young Girls"", was killed in a car crash three months after its Paris premiere. Also, for a surprising
look at Deneuve's FIRST screen role, check out ""The Twilight Girls"" from 1957, an art-house lesbian
nudie (now restored) from Radley Metzger with a very young 13 year old Deneuve (no nudity of her)
and an early topless Georgina Spelvin (the legendary 70's era porn star).  500 million stars for the

189006,4,1572521783,"Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a poignant French musical that could probably have been improved by allowing some spoken dialog. The Michel Legrand songs became well known, but to watch the luminous Catherine Deneuve yield to her gently controlling mother and marry that forgiving gentleman is still painful, because you know the love of her life will come home from Algeria and have his heart broken. Unfortunately, that ending is probably closer to reality than the ""Happily Ever After"" ending we expect from our American Musicals.",1141776000,5,527,5.211764705882353
189007,4,1572521783,"In 1964, filmmaker Jacques Demy made an audacious move by directing a deceptively simple love story completely in song. I would be hard pressed to call this movie a musical, opera or even an operetta since there are neither show-stopping production numbers nor soul-bearing arias on the soundtrack. Instead, we are presented everyday dialogue in a series of recitatives that bring a dramatic urgency to the most mundane of events. Why it works is that the story is not the happy-go-lucky romance one would suspect it will be from the bright colors of the production but rather a melancholy tale of love unfulfilled and the tenuousness of longing in the face of harsh realities. It is a Gallic version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" by way of William Inge's tale of teenage lust, ""Splendor in the Grass"" (in fact, Demy's ending bears a striking resemblance to the last scenes of Elia Kazan's film three years earlier).

The plot focuses on teenaged star-crossed lovers Genevieve and Guy, who develop a relationship through clandestine meetings despite the disapproval of Genevieve's mother, who thinks a gas station mechanic is beneath her daughter. The lovers eventually consummate their relationship once Guy finds he has been drafted to serve for France during the Algerian conflict. With Guy away, Genevieve discovers she is pregnant and must decide whether to wait for Guy's uncertain return or marry the rich diamond dealer, Roland Cassard, her mother's preference given the failing business of her umbrella shop. The story develops in subtle strokes almost like a Yasujiro Ozu film in that there aren't really any melodramatic confrontation scenes but instead moments of revelation. The wondrous Catherine Deneuve, all of twenty, had her first important role as Genevieve, and it's no wonder her career seems assured from her ethereal performance. With his earthy good looks and open-hearted manner, Nino Castelnuovo complements Deneuve as Guy, and their romance is palpable even in an amusingly contrived shot where they are obviously on a conveyor belt moving down the street. Anne Vernon lends a robust presence as Genevieve's mother as she plots her daughter's fate, and Marc Michel is appropriately bland as Roland.

Along with the vibrant colors faithfully recaptured in a 1996 restoration, such artifices really add to the film's charm. However, just as essential is Michel Legrand's score with his swooning romanticism at its most cinematic (and a precursor to the music he composed for Barbra Streisand's 1983 ""Yentl""), as it fills the dramatic arcs from start to finish. You will likely recognize the lounge standard melodies for the Americanized translations, ""I Will Wait for You"" and ""Watch What Happens"", as they are pervasive through the recitatives.  I enjoyed the movie very much but realize this will not be everyone's cup of tea, especially those already alienated by the musical genre. One can see this as an even more exaggerated form, but you can probably tell by the first two minutes whether you will be enraptured by it. The DVD also includes an excerpt from Demy's widow Agnes Varda's illuminating 1995 documentary, ""The World of Jacques Demy"".",1133913600,6,3167,5.157587548638133
189008,3,1572521783,"This is a French release with subtitles in English for the American viewing public.  It is a grand production of Michel Legrand's marvelous score, which makes me wish for the old Maurice Chevalier French-style singing as in 'Gigi.'  It is termed a 'movie operetta' in which all the dialogue is turned itno lyrics, completely ""singing"" no talk.  The video realese in 2001 is the restored version in candy-colored scenes of the enigma of a young pregnant, unmarried woman left behind in the Fifties.  Now, they are called 'single mothers;' how times have changed!

This one is the daughter of the owner of an umbrella shop in Cherbourg, France.  It almost always happened to the most popular and best-dressed girls who were turned into 'fallen women' who, in USA had to drop out of school.  It is the norm now to have indiscriminate sex whatever the age, nad who cares if you get 'caught'?  Some take the easy way out, abortion.  Back then, that was not an option.

- Image quality is significantly worse than the French release

189020,5,1572521783,"While Demy's color-saturated backdrops and coordinated dresses and suits have been justly praised, his achievement has to be seen in context.  In imitation of the stylized set-ups of Vincente Minnelli's ZIEGFELD FOLLIES and CABIN IN THE SKY, Demy's camera snakes through the picturesque streets of Cherbourg, poking into shop windows, racing ahead around corners with a brisk, airy pace, unafraid and remarkably steady and obtrusive.  The camera is everywhere, most obviously trying to penetrate the great beauty of its young stars as they throw their lives away; Demy uses the lens as Sherlock Holmes used his magnifying glass, to blow up the smallest gesture, frown or smile until it achieves meaning.

From George Sidney's luscious color palette, Demy borrows the idea of color as a psychological screen, filtering in emotions as the screen twists from cyan to yellow to a deep, passionate scarlet that sometimes turns unexpectedly prim, when money and sense raise their hands to object.  The opening sequence of BYE BYE BIRDIE, Ann-Margret blazing against a back projection of Yves-Klein blue, is said to have been screened by Demy over and over during the arduous months of preparation for this film, though no two central performances could be more different than Deneuve's and Ann-Margret's.

Finally, we can see the stylish fingerprints of Stanley Donen all throughout the interior designs of TUOC.  In the interior of the shop where Genevieve and her mother work, it's like a retail version of the apartment where Ingrid Bergman lives in INDISCREET, with its fantastic array of French prints in their startling, moderne frames, against which Bergman moved in her tight gold dress as a soignee woman of the world, not quite in her first youth, just as Anne Vernon, playing Deneuve's mother, is characterized as much by her wallpaper as by the flickers of memory that animate her still beautiful eyes.  Some have said that Demy's film lacks what 40s and 50s musicals had, namely, dance sequences (later, of course, Demy went overboard with the dance in the ROCHEFORT follow-up), and yet a dynamism animates the interplay, a bow in Terpsichore's direction.",1128556800,3,2162,5.16

189022,4,1572521783,"I watched ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" because I had heard it mentioned over the years and I remember it was nominated for several Academy Awards the year it came out.  Not too many foreign language films get nominated in any category other than ""Best Foreign Language Film"" so I assumed this movie was something special...and it is.  What I didn't know, before I sat down to watch it, was that ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" is a movie in which all the dialogue is sung.  In other words; it is an opera.  However, opera is not my thing.  I'm sure I could enjoy an ""Opera's Greatest Hits"" CD but I not accumstomed to watching a whole movie in song.  Since I am not an opera afficionado, I'm not sure anyone would be interested in my impression of the music.  Nonetheless, my impression of the music is that it was a gimmick as opposed to a serious attempt at song writing.  I say this because it seemed that I was listening to a sort of melodious chant throughout the movie instead of the operatic variations of orchestration.  One other knock on the singing is that it seemed to detract from the quality of the dialogue.  I asked myself, at times during the movie, if I would have been impressed with the dialogue if it were spoken rather than sung.  The answer was, repeatedly, no; it was too simplistic of a story.

So why did this grumpy reviewer give ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" four stars?  Well, the sets and the costumes were outstandingly colorful and I enjoyed that.  I also enjoyed the story despite its' simplicity because the ending impressed me on an emotional level.  Finally, I'm always willing to give an extra star for a director that's willing to try something new; an A for effort as they say.

I could tell by the other reviews that plenty of people loved this movie.  Don't let my negativity stop you from watching it.  After all, the movie ends in a rather beautiful way.  However, if your idea of a good French movie is a Renior, Truffaut or Godard, you might want to skip this one.",1125014400,3,2005,4.488950276243094
189023,5,1572521783,"There is no film quite like The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. The two protagonists have no evil enemies save the society itself. The mother (Madame Emery) of Genevieve (Catherine Deneuve) though her heart is in the right place in terms of genuine concern for her daughter's material well-being, and though her advice is due to her own life experience and its corresponding wisdom, is not a specifically courageous person. Rather than encourage her young daughter to wait for her lover, Guy (Nino Casternuevo) who is an appealing and decent young man, she does precisely the opposite. Madame Emery is in the business of selling umbrellas--protection from the elements, the natural forces of nature, and when it comes to protecting her daughter, there is no exception.

The film is so terribly sad because happiness is achieved despite the demise of the dream of young love. The society, even in the 1950s, was not set up to accomodate the young family that was freely and naturally selected by the young, attractive couple, made of two people who are unspoiled, genuine and sensitive.

 In a sense, this is a coming-of-age story with a bitter twist, sweetened only with the incredibly lovely pastel composition of the camera shots and Michel Legrand's breathtakingly beautiful score whose moving lyrics replace any would-be spoken dialogue.

If the criteria that defines art lies in showing something new in a new way, then Jacques Demy's film is successful as a work of art. The exquisite splashing of color through costume and set design, operatic delivery of lines, not to mention the fine acting, perfect editing and captivating theme and story, all make this film an endearing and enduring work of cinematic art.

My only question is why is the novelist, Marguerite Duras, who originally wrote the story upon which this film was based, not ever mentioned anywhere surrounding the film? Other than that, I have no reservations whatsoever in wholeheartedly recommending this lovely, luscious and most fine work of art.",1124582400,3,2014,5.090909090909091
189024,5,1572521783,"Umbrellas of Cherbourg is quite a few levels beyond a musical due to the operatic elements and fairytale sets. The summery pallet of pastel pinks and blues contributes to the childlike wonder and innocence in this romantic classic.

The wallpaper is magnificent and the sets are decorator dreams. The placement of umbrellas throughout the movie creates a magical element and seems to echo the protection Genevi&eacute;ve (Catherine Deneuve) craves from her true love and how none of us are truly protected from the rains of true love which can drench us in overwhelming desires.

Genevi&eacute;ve experiences passion with Guy and after one experience becomes pregnant. Her mother handles the situation fairly well, and instead of delving into moral lessons, Jacques Demy focuses on the exaltation of love and a subtle acceptance of life's challenges. He has also beautifully woven kindness and eventuality into the complex human experience.

Do you have a new box of tissues? The score was written to induce a tearful response. Not only does it succeed, it ""excels"" in this task. The music is dreamy and comforting all while taking you through a very human experience.

Umbrellas of Cherbourg is filled with sweet dreams, snow, rain, fantasy candy-colored sets and difficult decisions which seem to be made more by circumstance and financial considerations.

Camera techniques are blissfully creative and characters wander from room to room in a natural flow of experience. Singing continues throughout, creating one of the most memorable musical experiences in cinema.

189025,5,1572521783,"This movie is odd and unforgettable.  The subject matter is realistic, but it's handled so gracefully, it's like watching a  fairy tale.  There's so many reasons to like this movie; I can't really think of anything to compare.  Catherine Deneuve is stunning, but then so is the woman who plays her mother, and for that matter,  so are her suitors.  Everyone in the movie is beautiful.  You won't find any characters with tattoos.  And even if the actors weren't so beautiful, the clothing and backgrounds of sharp oranges and reds and greens are very striking.

I've always thought of Michel Legrand as one of the last great songwriters, on par with Henry Mancini and Antonio Carlos Jobim, before they started putting something in the water to stop songwriters from writing good melodies.  His music is delightful, ranging from big band to cocktail jazz to some lovely ballads.  ""I Will Wait for You"" and ""Watch What Happens"" became standards, and it's interesting to contrast the familiar lyrics with the various French lyrics in the film.

The visual and musical appeal of the film is such that I think it would be a good watch for non-French speakers even without subtitles.  I'm not usually a fan of romantic movies, but I would recommend this highly.",1122076800,7,1255,4.835680751173709
189026,3,1572521783,"I enjoyed this movie.  The characters were appealing, the story was relatable, the period style is nostalgic, I cared about these people.  But, as an opera, it falls flat.

In operas or musicals, singing's the thing.  In this opera, what the orchestra plays is far more interesting than what the singers sing.  Although a novelty, it would have made no difference if the dialogue were spoken or sung.  That does not make a good opera.

The constume designer had a similar problem--having to work around the wild colors and patterns of the wallpaper in the umbrella shop and apartment.  Which is more important...the clothing or the wall covering?  Which is more important...the singer's part or the orchestral background?

Still, it was an entertaining and enjoyable film.  The fact that it's an opera is meaningless.",1120262400,3,817,5.022388059701493
189027,5,1572521783,"This movie is so incredibly beautiful.  The storyline is excellent on its own...but the music just puts this one over the top.  And while it's not a musical, singing the lyrics just seemed to natural.  I can't remember the last time a movie affected me as much as this one has.  This is one I would recommend again and again.",1109635200,2,325,4.366666666666666
189028,5,1572521783,"This French film from the early 1960s is essentially an opera about two young people, their declarations of undying love, and then subsequently, the peace they make with life.  It is very, very beautiful, both visually and musically. Really, the film could have been about anything, as long as those lovely sets and songs were in place!  I recommend this movie without reservation to any serious student of the history of film.  It is also the perfect romantic movie.",1107907200,2,467,4.886075949367089
189029,5,1572521783,"Jacques Demy created a mini-masterpiece with this homage to the classic Hollywood musicals from a decade before.  The opening shot is just a hint of the wonderfully creative treat that lies ahead for the viewer. I will not give one moment of the film away but only concentrate on the following.

  Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castlenuovo are the impossibly young and beautiful stars of this film. Were there ever two more beautiful actors in Europe at that time? I doubt it. They bring to life a true portrait of the tender and doomed love they share to the screen with a skill and grace that is unmatched. This visual perfection of youth and love is matched only by the glorious music of Michel Legrand. The score proves irresistible and sweeps the tender but thin story to the heights of grand opera. The use by Demy of color in the film is so precise and purposeful and helps add to the emotional pull of the entire effort.

  Being that the film is presented entirely in song may feel for some at first a little strange, but I urge those who give The Umbrellas of Cherbourg a change to hang in there and ""watch what happens."" I promise you that the bright jazzy score will capture you. You will find yourself humming one of the more famous tunes days later.

  And indeed the last scene is brilliantly handled and one of the great moments of romantic cinema.",1104105600,5,1361,4.518367346938776

Catherine Deneuve plays a young girl who is faced with an important life decision in her tender youth that affects her life and the man she loves who must leave for military service.  Nino Castelnuovo plays the young man who returns form war to the news of his love married to another man.

189042,5,1572521783,"Those of you who haven't seen this French musical, where all of the dialogue is sung like an opera, the lead actresses' ensembles match the wallpaper, self-parody is laugh-out-loud funny, and the more muted, equally dramatic scenes can bring tears to your eyes, are missing out on a treat!  Catherine Deneuve has never been lovelier.  She was only twenty years old when she made this film, and she and Nino Castelnuovo, her romantic lead, are lovely together.  Keep in mind that all of tha actors' singing voices were dubbed by professional singers.  This story of young, star-crossed love, and life throwing rocks on the road to happiness, is classic.  The musical score is catchy, and some of the songs might ring familiar in American audience's ears.  A couple of the tunes were recorded in the U.S.A. in English and became Top 40 Hits.
IF IT TAKES FOREVER I WILL WAIT FOR YOU and WATCH WHAT WILL HAPPEN are the two that come to mind.  Maybe there were others?  I remember that WATCH WHAT WILL HAPPEN was recorded by Brazil 66, updated as a sexy samba.  Don't miss out!",1084233600,3,1072,4.659574468085107
189043,5,1572521783,"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a fantastic film with a deceptively simple story, outrageous colors, and beautiful music (especially the tune ""I Will Wait For You"" played during the opening and ending). Fine performances from the cast as well, and all the dialogue is sung. As far as DVD transfers are concerned this looks better and as flawless as you can expect and DVD collectors shouldn't pass up the new Koch Lorber edition of this wonderful movie.",1083888000,8,451,4.87012987012987
189044,5,1572521783,"There really isn't another film quite like THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG.  For instance, every line of dialogue in the movie is sung, yet apart from the heartbreakingly beautiful ""I Will Wait for You,"" there are no songs.  So, is it a musical?  In form it seems more like an operetta.  Musically, the dialogue is loosely organized, though certain musical themes are repeated often, and it lightly sung, none of the performers coming across as highly trained professional singers.  Overall, the music, despite the presence of only one song, is entrancing.
As fine as the music is, I actually found the film to be more riveting on a purely visual level.  For instance, inn scene after scene, I found myself focusing on the art design rather than the music.  Demy frames most of his shots against backgrounds of more or less solid and striking colors--green walls, blue-stripped wallpaper, unusually painted building.  Demy also employs a host of subtle camera angles and techniques.  The film is unquestionably as much for the eyes as for the ears.
Most members of the cast were unknown to me, except, of course, for the surreally beautiful Catherine Deneuve, who was nineteen during most of the production of the film.  She exudes star quality throughout.  But none of the performers fails at all in their roles, though none of the others was the budding star that she was.  One thing that struck me about all of the characters was that while the tale told is essentially a tragic one--or at least a bittersweet one--there are really no bad guys.  Marc Michel, for instance, who plays Deneuve's wealthy suitor Roland Cassard, is a thoroughly likable person, even admirable.  She clearly doesn't love him, but in no conceivable sense is he a bad person.  Nino Castelnuovo's character Guy Foucher, for whom Deneuve's Genevi&egrave;ve Emery has asserted she ""wait forever"" turns out to be an inconstant correspondent, but apart from that he does nothing actively unkind to Genevi&egrave;ve.  Genevi&egrave;ve's mother might push her towards Roland and away from Guy, but she is clearly motivated by a love of her daughter.  The movie could have been subtitled:  ""A Tragedy with No Villains.""  The film is about love, but it is sadly not a love story.  In a way, it deconstructs the kind of romantic myths that dominates the musical genre.  This is the anti-Disney version of the possibility of eternal love.",1083283200,76,2400,4.95
189045,5,1572521783,"Maybe, or maybe it isn't even technically a musical at all - the film trades the traditional concept of a musical number for an operatic style in which all dialogue is sung. Whether it is the greatest musical or not, ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" is undeniably an absolutely overwhelming cinematic experience. In addition to being one of the greatest love stories ever to grace the medium, Jacques Demy's film about love and loss is a masterful exercise in style. A montage of explosive pastels and haunting music, it represents a high point in world cinema, and incidentally, in my DVD collection. Catherine Deneuve's performance is sublime.
My only minor complaint - and this DVD is so good that I hesitate to mention it - is that the yellow subtitles do not always contrast well with the background and this makes them occasionally difficult to read. This is slightly frustrating, but not enough to justify docking any points from my overall assessment.
The bottom line is that if you enjoy musicals, love stories, foreign films, art films, or all of the above, this is an essential addition to your DVD collection.",1083024000,4,1117,4.88421052631579
189046,5,1572521783,"If you love film, this is a DVD you must own, and if you already own the old version this is one case where upgrading is an absolute necessity, the difference is staggering.
I've never seen a DVD that was more of an improvement over a previous release. The colors explode off the screen from this razor sharp anamorphic transfer, which finally presents the film in its original aspect ratio.
If you have the old Fox Lorber disc, find the nearest bonfire or trash compactor, because that's the only place suitable for it.
I took some comparison captures of the two discs on my computer and the results are astonishing. The old disc swears it's from the 1994 restored version, but I find that hard to believe. The colors are faded beyond belief and there's a deep blue tint to the whole film that's instantly visible when you compare it to this new Koch Lorber version.
In addition, the old Fox Lorber DVD suffered from a problem common to videos of European films. In Europe they use the PAL color system for their televisions rather than NTSC, which we use here. PAL has higher resolution, but runs at a different speed and requires films to be sped up by 4% to match it.
There's a long technical explanation, but basically they found a way around this for NTSC. The end result is that films in PAL are about five minutes shorter than they should be. There's nothing missing they're just moving at a higher speed than intended, causing everything to move ever so slightly faster and voices and music to go to a higher pitch.
The old DVD was from a PAL master, so it was 1hr 27 mins long and had the flicker in the image that usually results from a PAL to NTSC conversion.
The new DVD is a true NTSC version, so you finally get to see Umbrellas at its proper length of 1hr 32mins. Again, there are no restored scenes or anything, it's merely being run at the correct speed at last. Still, that means five extra minutes of eye-popping color, glorious music and Catherine Deneuve
Koch Lorber deserves major, enormous, gigantic congratulations for finally doing right by this cinema classic and giving it the DVD it deserves. Bravo!",1081296000,17,2128,4.558746736292428
189047,5,1572521783,"In theory, this should be a very annoying film--everything is sung, the characters are a bit thin, and the sets and costumes were so relentlessly Now and Mod that they became period pieces about six months after the film was released.
But it isn't the slightest bit annoying--Chaterine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuevo may not do the singing, but they mime this story of missed chances and lost love with such simplicity and sincerity that they break your heart.  And although the lyrics are a bit sappy at times, the music, by Michel Legrand, is some of the lovliest to grace a soundtrack.  And that pastel-colored setting, though not exactly faithful to period covered by the story (the Deneuve of 1957 looks little different than the Deneuve of some seven years later, when the story ends), is quietly enchanting in and of itself.  The secret to Jacques Demy's fantasies is that he didn't forget the real world that bred them--his stories soften some of the sadness of life's blows, but it doesn't forget that they happen . . .",1078099200,2,1026,4.752808988764045
189048,5,1572521783,"If one excepts the Indian production, Jacques Demy's masterpiece THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG is one of the rare musicals made outside Hollywood. And, rather curiously, the film ages a lot better than 95 % of the industrial american production of the 40's and the 50's. How's that ? Maybe simply because the film has also been written by its director who was able to put in THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG a piece of himself.
Even if the Fox Lorber DVD is not perfect, as often with this company, the colors of the movie sets will explode on your screen and amaze you in the same manner they have enchanted the 1964 audience. Catherine Deneuve's tears, Michel Legrand's music and a perfect cinematography are sufficient reasons to buy this DVD, to show it your friends and your children and, then, to place it on a special shelf of your library.",1074297600,,838,4.630872483221476
189065,5,1572521783,"""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" is more than just a movie...it is a beautiful and moving experience for the ears, the eyes, and the heart.
The movie is one long song-literally, as all of the dialogue-from ""Can I have an oil change?"" (the hero is an auto mechanic) to ""I will love you forever"" is sung. The movie is divided into three acts-""Departure,"" ""Absence"" and ""Return.""
In the first act, ""Departure,"" we are introduced to the heroine and hero, Genevieve (a breathtaking Catherine Deneuve) and Guy. Genevieve's mother, a practical woman, owns an umbrella shop in Cherbourg. On the sly, Genevieve slips out and allows herself to be wooed by Guy, the handsome young auto mechanic with dreams of owning his own garage someday. The lover dream, sing, and most of all love each other in this act, which ends with Guy departing for a two-year stint in the Army and Genevieve promising to love him forever. I won't ruin the movie but suffice to say, in Act II (Absence), Genevieve deals with a pregnancy, a rich and ardent suitor and a very practical mother. Act III (Return) witnesses the impact of her decisions on a number of people.
There is more, much more, to this movie than just song and love. It is expertly shot. The sets are amazing and rich with candy-colored rooms. The colors just pop out at you. The clothes-ah the effortless chic of these French women-are well tailored and could be worn today. Finally, the acting is so deeply felt even though every single line is sung.
I cannot recommend this movie enough to lovers not just of French film and movie musicals but of serious cinema in general. It is well worth your time. And you will be humming some of the more popular themes for a long time...",1073520000,3,1709,4.625
189066,5,1572521783,"There is no other movie out there anything like this. Jacques Demy's masterpiece is beautifully colour coordinated and every bit of dialogue is sung. It sounds a bit contrived but it is one of the most genuinely moving and purest love stories ever to be committed to celluloid. Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo are the young lovers not allowed to be. Michel Legrand's score/songs are gorgeous and a couple of the themes ""I Will wait For You"" and ""Watch what Happens"" were transferred to hits for other top class artists but have never sounded better than they do here. This isn't a movie I can put on any old time, it's just too beautiful, too emotional and even upsetting for that. But from the opening shot of the rain and umbrellas with Legrand's ""I Will Wait For You"" coming in softly below you know you are going to witness something really special. This is a profound movie in every sense. Be warned it will tear your heart out of your chest, throw it down on the table and batter it with a BIG mallet.",1066348800,4,1014,4.516304347826087
189067,5,1572521783,"""Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" is the simple and timeless story of two young lovers, Guy and Genevieve (played by Nino Castelnuovo and Catherine Deneuve) who plan to marry until those plans are disrupted when Guy is drafted into military service.
After Guy departs for the Army, Genevieve discovers that she is carrying Guy's child.  Genevieve's loving mother Madame Emery, portrayed by Anne Vernon, worries about the future and welfare of Genevieve and her unborn child.  Madame Emery is a widow who makes a meager living selling umbrellas in her small shop. (Thus the title of this movie ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg"".)
One day Mme. Emery visits a local jeweler hoping to sell her necklace in order to obtain some cash to help pay her mounting debts.  By chance, she encounters a handsome, young businessman there, Roland, played by Marc Michel.  He offers to buy the necklace when the jeweler declines to do so.  Roland sees Genevieve who has accompanied her mother.  He instantly falls for the lovely young woman.
Will Genevieve wait for Guy to return from the Army?  Or will she accept Roland's eventual marriage proposal?  You'll have to see this irresistable movie to find out.
""Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" is an inventive, unqualified classic.  The entire dialogue in this movie is sung by a gorgeous, talented cast.  The wondrous Jacque Demy's direction is graceful and elegant.  And Demy's screenplay and lyrics are sensitive and perceptive.  The performances by Deneuve, Castelnuovo, Vernon and company are superbly gratifying.
As for the rest of this movie, Michel Legrand's music is ravishing and intoxicating.  And the photography, sets, and costumes are stylish and accomplished.
This is also the movie that made Catherine Deneuve an international star and deservedly so.  Her restrained, yet heartbreaking performance is unforgettable.  Deneuve's delicate and entrancing beauty define perfection.

It also has another particularity, in that the entire dialogue is sung, with music - essentially making it one long low-profile musical. This can add very much emotion to a story if well done, and in this case it is. The French actors (including a young Catherine Deneuve) do not look ackward.
The story is about two young people who fall in love, but separated by the draft. They come to marry other people, for more practical reasons, and never look back. It is, in essence, a triumph of practicality against romanticism. Also, a big plus for me, kissing is kept at a minimum. If, like me, you hate modern sappy romance movies and their devices and clichs, run, run, run buy The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.",1049068800,4,802,4.576388888888889
189069,5,1572521783,"Maybe not.

Les Parapluies de Cherbourg is one of the most beautiful movies ever made with an enchanting and haunting score by Michel Le Grande, and totally focused, sharp and creative direction by Jacques Demy.  Catherine Deneuve gives a fine performance in pinkish white makeup with her blonde hair pulled away from her famous face, at twenty playing a seventeen-year-old shopkeeper's daughter who falls in love with a garage mechanic.  He is called away to the war in Algeria after making her pregnant.  Will she wait for him as the award-winning song proclaims?  Will their love endure the long separation?

All the dialogue is sung.  The script is terse with nothing extraneous to the bittersweet story.  Because the dialogue is stripped to the barest essentials, the singing seems natural and enhances the dream-like quality established early with the rain falling on the umbrellas and the cobblestone streets of the seacoast town.  The sets are splashed in vivid color.  Everything is superficially romantic, but the events are the starkest realism.

When a young girl is forced to choose between love and security, which does she choose?  It depends on the circumstances, and sometimes circumstances and the passage of time can change her heart.

I was a teenager in France when this was made in the sixties.  The backdrops of the white Esso gas station, the red and yellow passenger train cars, the bouffant hair styles on the girls, their eyes heavily made up with mascara and black eyeliner, the ubiquitous bicycles and the little French ""cigarette roller"" cars all brought back vivid memories of youth as did the musical score.

A question: what ever happened to the ""other"" girl, Ellen Farner who played Madeleine?  To be honest I found her more attractive than Deneuve who of course went on to become a great star and an acclaimed international beauty.  Farner was never heard from again.

Some scenes made more effective by their simplicity: When Genevieve (Deneuve) returns home after a late evening with Guy, her mother (Anne Vernon) surveys her daughter and exclaims, ""What have you done?""  Genevieve retorts sharply, ""Mama!"" and it is clear what she has done.  Also, as Guy is going off to the army Madeleine arrives upon the scene as he is saying good-bye to his stepmother who is ill.  They exchange glances that reveal Madeleine's love for him.  And then she sings out softly in the heartfelt regret of parting, ""Adieu, Guy.""  We know these are not the last words that will pass between them.  Additionally, the brief, beautifully structured, final scene at the shiny new Esso gas station is not to be forgotten.

The scenes with Roland Cassard (Marc Michel), the suave, traveling man of means who sells Madame Emery's jewelry so she can pay the taxes on her umbrella shop, are nicely staged so that we can see at a glance that he is enormously taken with Guinevere and that the mother will do everything possible to further his case.  It is agreeable for those identifying with Guinevere that Roland is not only well off financially, but is as handsome as the garage mechanic.  But will he still want her when he learns that she is pregnant with another man's child?

Jacques Demy who also wrote the script is to be commended for the effortless pace and tight focus of this romantic tale of star crossed lovers.  I wish every director had such an ability to cut the extraneous and concentrate on the essentials without intrusion.  The tale is an atmospheric tour de force of love lost and gained, of bourgeois values triumphant.

This might be a bit precious for some, but upon seeing this for the third time, I can tell you I was enchanted anew.

189073,5,1572521783,"I saw this back in the 60's. It captivated me by it's unusual concept, which, led me toward a love of musical drama and opera. I was in high school. I immediately bought the soundtrack LP album. Hearing it is wonderful, but this new DVD version is spectacular! Knowing more of French now (though not that much) I recognize that the subtitles are more correct now than when originally released (I bought the badly faded VHS version a while back). Previous reviewers have covered most everything and I'll try not to repeat. One thing that bears repeating is that Catherie Daneuve was the most beautiful woman in the world, then as now. (Subjective, but few will disagree). A fan of musical films, I'm amazed at how the voices seem to seamlessly flow out of the mouths of the actors, since it was dubbed by real singers. The acting remained intact, without the efforts of the vocal ability involved. This restoration pretty much retrieves the original intention of production designer, Bernard Evein. The colors are so grotesquely vivid as to compliment the idea of the sung dialogue. It is indeed a modern fairy tale...young love ain't always what it seems. Jacques Demy took a chance, and gave us a unique film experience of classic proportions.  Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the '64 Oscars, it was then nominated in '65 for 4 more after it's American general release (Song ""I Will Wait for You""...a standard now...as well as screenplay, original Score and Adapted Musical Score.) I watched an hour of this film before I realized the subtitles weren't on. I was still riveted after all these years. When I first saw this, I was getting over my first pangs of lost love. I can't think of another film that will bring you to those same bitter-sweet moments of your past. So beautifully presented, so naturally acted; you soon forget that they're singing all the time (great voices, too). Ellen Farner, as Madeleine, gives the best performance (she looks a lot like Katharine Ross), her every nuance is heartfelt.

Never had this happened to me.  I have not done that with any film in 20 years... no matter how hard any film tried to get one to cry.  The film is in three parts... it is in the third that the effect of the story comes.
The first part is very dramatic, almost to the point of being melodramatic.  When the true sorrow comes in, the film is un-dramatic, making the sorrow stronger than melodrama could achieve.  A very useful tool.  It is not just the story, but the manner in which the story is told.  The feeling of isolation is so well done by removing a character one gets use to seeing.

Tragedy strikes the two lovers when the boyfriend receives his draft notice to fight in the Algerian war. The young woman's mother becomes poor and she is forced into a marriage she doesn't like. 2 years later, the boyfriend comes home...",1011139200,,521,4.8
189098,5,1572521783,"'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' (""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg"") may well be one of the three most important French films ever made. The other two positions would probably go to 'Les enfants du Paradis' (""The Children of Paradise"") and 'La Belle Verte' (""The Beautiful Green""). French critics unanimously agree that its one of the most telling remnants of the 1960s, and the fact that it made Catherine Deneuve a star is of little consequece when you look at the picture as a whole - think of it as the French equivalent to The Beatles' 'Magical Mystery Tour', at least in terms of spirit.
Why is this little-seen gem one of the best examples of superior motion picture-making? Well, for one, not one word of dialogue is spoken. Everything is in the form of song. While this might repel audiences who aren't exactly enthralled by Andrew Lloyd Webber or a night out at the opera, this is definitely not a soppy Italian-style operetta with everyone grieving all around. On the other hand, what we are treated to is a timely romantic tale, both spiritual and grave in its' treatment.
The story is pretty straightforward. Catherine and Nino Castelnuovo are lovers - Catherine owns an umbrella shop with her mother, and Nino is a car repair-man at the local garage. When he gets called away for the war (I love how this film managed to side-step any possible political statement, and instead focusses on the lovely curtains in Catherine's bedroom) our heroine finds herself pregnant.
The rest of the story is extremely compelling. It succeeds where even a film like 'Dancer in the Dark' failed. That film attempted to whip its' audience into a weeping frenzy by going all out for the punch - this one manages to do so with the utmost simplicity, and triumphs when its' time comes. And the music is instantly reminiscent of the beauty of the era.
Everyone probably knows how this film ends - our starcrossed lovers never do end up together. In fact, Catherine marries a man who is willing to 'take her in', and Nino fathers his own child and marries another woman. All this because of a bitter miscommunication that forms the crux of the film. I love this movie because it never pretends to be something its not, and no-one is perfect. Its' heroine gets pregnant out of wedlock, and the hero is never shown to be a totally 'moral' man (in one scene, he pays for a sexual encounter). But with the French, its not about morality, but matters of the heart, be it torrid or tame, and this is where 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' towers the most.
There are two gutwrenching scenes in this film. One is where Jacques has to leave for the war, and the two lovers say goodbye at the train station. The other, of course, is the chilling, colder-than-ice climax that would probably have you burst into tears and remember your past loves lost. Quite frankly, I have never sat through a film where the ending runs quite unspectaculary, but leaves you totally shaken.
I bought this film on DVD recently and am touched to discover how this movie stands up to the test of time. Perhaps more poignant and relevant now in a world gone mad, I seriously recommend you get this film to bring back the ideals of goodness, purity and the rarity that is young love, back into your life. The DVD itself is a splendid little piece. There are no real extras, but there are English subtitles. The film is divided by date, and the chapters (there are nine) corelate to the dates. The only thing that saddened me is that there was no way to view the film as it was originally created - in three parts. But to have this movie on DVD itself is a boon, so I won't go on.
There is also a 're-issue' ad for when the movie was re-released in 1992. This ad only features the sad train station sequence, with the epic score playing in the background. There are also cast filmographies (Deneuve laters returned to do the 'sequel' to this movie, entitled 'The Young Girls of Rochefort', while Nino never really gained star status - this film, alongwith 1962's 'Escapade in Florence' remains his best works).
I liked how the DVD was, like the movie, simple and smart. There is a 'restoration' section on the DVD, but this is just a text document that explains how Jacques Demy's widow Agnes supervised the recreation process. Its a marvel that Jacques had the good sense to save this film on different mediums back in the 60s. If not, we would never get to see this edition.
The soundtrack to this film is also notorious. There are people in France, especially the '60s lot, who know the entire film word-for-word. A brilliant exercise, and I recommend that you let your children do the same. I never knew that there was a film built upon this music until much later in my life - indeed, when you hear the opening strains of the score, you'll be able to instantly recognize it, but will fail to place it. If you're shopping on Amazon, I would highly recommend that you also pick up the rare 2-CD soundtrack set - its really worth it.
Get this for yourself, and your children. ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" is one of those rare instances where you rediscover how wonderful it was to be in love, and how sometimes time sweeps away and erases with it the possibilities of different destinies, different outcomes. It will make you reexamine your life and make you wonder where you had lost yourself down this long road we call life. And any film that can do that, is a top notch effort in my book.
Epic, touching, and never boring, 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' is one of the true classics of the twentieth century. I highly recommend this to anyone who has a heart.",1007424000,17,5608,4.5810945273631845
189099,5,1572521783,"Through composiotion, in which every line of dialogue is sung, is common enough in opera, but rare in musicals; for most fans of theater and movies, ""Evita"" was the first example of this stylistic technique they'd ever seen. But long before ""Evita"", Jaques and Michel Legrand pioneered this style in ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"". At first it's a little jarring. Mechanics in a garage are washing up, and singing to each other as they do. ""What are you doing tonight?"" ""I'm going dancing. What are you doing?"" It seems all very unnatural. But very quickly the viewer adjusts to the style, and it begins to seem not at all unusual.
Legrand's music is of course wonderfully lyrical, and the combination of the music, the pastel colors that dominate the sets and the soft lighting result in a look not unlike the great MGM musicals- though with a very French feel. The story is a perfect tragic romance; boy and girl fall in love, they're seperated, and find love elsewhere- while still remembering each other. The entire cast are warm and sympathetic, and Catherine Deneuve in her first major role is breathtakingly beautiful.
If you love musicals, and you like the classic post-war French cinema, you'll find in this film the perfect synthesis of the two genres.",1002844800,6,1260,4.837962962962963

Yet, the melodies and melodrama are absolutely hypnotic. The acting is uniformly excellent and comes through the music with every nuance intact. Most striking is the over-the-top visual beauty (check out the sumptuous wallpaper in every room!). Jacques Demy and Michel Legrand turned what could easily have been a very mundane little romance story into a poetic and beautiful tale of adolescence angst and innocence compromised.

I sent it for refund and ordered one from Amazon meanwhile. I was sure there can be no problems with it. But surprisingly, when I put the disc into the player it would display the root menu and get stuck. Later I recognized that the disc has broken structure..

189115,5,1572521783,"When Jacques Demy created his souffle of a musical, his plan was to continue a story he had begun with his film LOLA, starring Anouk Aimee, and then continued in BAY OF ANGELS with Jeanne Moreau.  Characters from the first two films appear either by reference or in the flesh (Marc Michel, the young diamond merchant, was once in love with Lola and sings an aria over visuals of a shopping area used in LOLA) in UMBRELLAS, and the story was to have continued with THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHFORT, having Guy go to Rochfort from Cherbourg to buy equipment for his gas station and, in true Hollywood musical fashion, run into twin sisters, one of whom is the double of Genvieve from UMBRELLAS (again played by Catherine Deneuve).  Unfortunately the actor (Nino Castelnuovo) who played Guy had committed to do a t.v. series and was unavailable, so Demy rewrote his concept, brought in one of his musical film heroes, Gene Kelly, ended his dream of being a filmic Balzac, and basically ended his trilogy with THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG.

The marriage of music, color, visuals, faces, emotions, and finally war enabled Demy to present his most romantic picture to date with THE UMBRELLAS.

Aside from two fairytale musicals (PEAU D'ANE and THE PIED PIPER [starring then-rock star Donovan]) that followed, his later films never achieved the joy, romance nor success of THE UMBRELLAS, although he did come to L.A. in 1968 and made a fourth chapter to the film history, going back to LOLA and having Anouk Aimee come to Los Angeles where she is getting by as a model in a photographic ""model shop"", hence the name of the film, MODEL SHOP....she shows pictures of characters from the earlier films, and if you've seen them all, this film should come full circle.  The young man obsessed with Lola was played by Gary Lockwood, right after his 2001:A Space Odyssey experience.  Demy wanted another young actor to play the role, but Columbia Studio bosses felt he wasn't anyone, had no real background and they wanted to draw people who knew Lockwood.  The young actor was Harrison Ford.  And Michel LeGrand didn't do the music.  Demy wanted the music to be very fresh and American, and so hired SPIRIT to work with him, when he couldn't convince Jimmy Morrison and the Doors to do it.  The film is a love letter to Los Angeles, but didn't come anywhere near the success of Demy's UMBRELLAS.

In UMBRELLAS, the naivete of the teenaged (or just out of) Deneuve and the sweetness and naivete of the story lends itself to this bouquet of love lost, choices made and life lived.

The music, of course, is the most recognizable of Michel Legrand's work, two of it's songs having received worldwide recognition.

189120,4,1572521783,"Up until 6 months ago, I had never heard of ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.""  My mom used to hum a couple of tunes from this French musical, but I never made the connection.  However, I came across the DVD  of this classic musical a bit back while searching for a present for my  mother, and I quickly fell in love with this musical.  It is different from  most musicals, as it is (1) French, and (2) sung the whole way through.  All the ""dialogue"" is sung in the recitative manner of opera  music and lead so naturally into the actual songs that you really can't  tell the difference.  The story itself concerns the bittersweet love  between the young daughter (Catherine Deneuve) of a shopkeeper and a young  man who learns shortly that he has been drafted to join the French army.
It is a beautiful story told simply and effectively by one of the French  New Wave directors, Jacques Demy.  As I understand it, he made a few more  musicals starring Catherine Deneuve (The Young Girls of Rochefort,  Donkeyskin), but this film was his most popular musical.  For a long time,  this film was considered ""lost"" due to deterioration of the film  stock, its vivid colors reduced to pale shadows of its original glorious  hues.  However, thanks to recovery of an alternate negative that retained  the original colors, the film was abled to be restored to its former  brilliance.  This restored version of the film is what is available  currently on DVD.
Truthfully, it looks quite fantastic.  The colors are  briliant enough to rival the Hollywood Technicolor process, and the sound  is clean.  I am glad I bought this DVD, and it has quickly become one of my  favorite musicals.
I only have a few problems with the DVD itself.  First, subtitles are only in English.  I would have liked to have seen  French subtitles as well, but such was not the case.  Also, the film  transfer gets a little blocky and pixelated here and there; I understand  that Fox/Lorber has a questionable on/off reputation with their DVDs, and I  wish they could have been just a tad bit more careful with this classic.  This marred an otherwise beautiful restoration effort.  Lastly, I wished  there were more chapter marks.  Some of the best songs lie no where close  to any of the chapter marks and thus require either bookmarking or  fast-forwarding.  Not a big concern, but just a little  inconvenient.
However, this is still an excellent film, and I would  HIGHLY recommend it to any lovers of musicals!  Purchase/rent/watch this  film without delay!  And a note to Fox/Lorber - how about releasing  ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" out on DVD?  I know it was  somewhat restored as well and had a limited re-release; this would be an  excellent companion piece to Umbrellas of Cherbourg!",963360000,54,2758,4.708860759493671

As a different twist on the French  New Wave movement, Umbrellas will tear your heart out as any man or woman  who has known the bitter twists of unhappy love can attest.
