7984623,5,B00008J2F1,"This is the study of Egypt as only National Geographic could offer it! There are more than two hours of beautiful and detailed study of archaeology in Egypt. You'll become an eye witness to the opening of a sarcophagus, find out about the building of the Pyramids, go through ruins and so much more. This two-pack of DVD's is most definitely worth the purchase price. I purchased this for a child, but the entire family loves it!

Highly recommended!",1254009600,5,450,4.69620253164557
