8483958,5,B005R1AH6O,Bought for son-in-law. He was exceptionally pleased.,1421625600,2,52,6.571428571428571
8483959,4,B005R1AH6O,"My son watched some of these when they were on ESPN. I purchased the 30 for 30 series for him, as we both enjoyed the ones we saw from that series. He is a PE major and appreciates not only the game itself but the story behind the story. These films give you both. The only one in the series I have actually seen is the one about the Cubs and Steve Bartman. Being a true Cubs fan that one was of course heartbreaking and intense. He has seen all of them, and it did not matter if he knew the story or not, he was entertained by them all. Even non-sports fans will appreciate the stories.",1340323200,2,587,4.0256410256410255
8483960,5,B005R1AH6O,Wonderfully directed and humanely told stories. The best and worst of human nature for all to see in something that should unite us.,1333152000,2,132,4.782608695652174
8483961,1,B005R1AH6O,"What a rip off!  Last year's 30 for 30 had 15 films in each set for 50 dollars. This set had
only 5 films for the same price. Very misleading advertising also give the impression
that you will be getting the film you are now watching on ESPN. Please don't give us
the impression we are getting a lot more than we realy are. 50 bucks for 5 tv films,
what a rip off!!!!.",1326326400,20,368,3.972972972972973
8483962,4,B005R1AH6O,"Jockey Chris Antley described the feelings of heaven and hell on earth that he had experienced in his life. He saw being on top in horse racing as heaven and hell as dealing with his private struggles.  In contrast to the stories of Seabiscuit and Secretariat, the euphoria of beating the best or winning the Triple Crown races goes from sweet to bitter in the story of Charismatic and Chris Antley.  Both the experiences of the horse and the jockey as individuals and as a team bring emotion to this touching story.  If you loved the other stories of triumphant horses, as well as their jockies and owners who were underdogs, you will be touched by this film, but the feelings you will be left with at the end will be quite different.  This is another testament to the emotional investment horse racing fans have in the sport and how it can reach out and touch something in even casual race fans.",1318982400,3,897,4.518518518518518
