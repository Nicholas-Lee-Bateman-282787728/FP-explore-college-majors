7911607,4,B00000IXO3,Enjoyed the movie and wanted it because I had only seen the last few minutes of the movie and I wanted to see it in it's entirety.,1407369600,,130,3.8518518518518516
7911608,3,B00000IXO3,This film was an attempt to be funny and not so. enough violence was shown and the main characters a bit on the non sympathetic side. All said and done it is an ok movie at best about a drug deal gone bad.,1368144000,,205,3.7906976744186047
7911609,2,B00000IXO3,"The other reviews are so glowing.  I guess it must just chalk up to taste in movies.

Depressing because you could see where it was going from the start.

The best part:  Jeff Fahey did a great job with the voice and the Danish accent, brief as his dialogue was.  5 words?

To think I put up with all the rest just to see that.",1233273600,,327,3.953846153846154
7911610,5,B00000IXO3,"This is one of the most interesting movies, I

have ever seen! I can say, that I have seen it

at least 50 times, and each time, I discovered

something new, about it. This movie is,

atmospheric, in the sense, that it magically,

draws you into the sghts, sounds, and vibes, of

the desert. The dialogue is human, and natural,

with all of the desire to lust, make money, and

feel good! The role played by Darren Mc Gaven,

is especially interesting, and the Old Indian

Shaman, was a special treat, as he came onto

the scene, totally unexpected, to carry Ben,

out of his head...I love the entrance, Jeff

Fahey makes, toward the end of the movie, and

how the tables turn in Ben's favor, thanks to

the Old Indian, who seems to have been guiding

him all along. I will definitely continue

checking this web site, for Small Time on DVD..",1130198400,7,842,4.398692810457517
7911611,5,B00000IXO3,"Along the lines of other off-the-beaten path movies- this one is a gem. A  ""Deal"" gone bad in the middle of the desert.  Where else can you find drugs, amateur dealers, cons, prostitutes, and Jeff Fahey. If you  liked Buffalo '66, Truth or Consequences N.M., or Outside Ozona - you MUST  see Smalltime!",955238400,10,302,4.6415094339622645
