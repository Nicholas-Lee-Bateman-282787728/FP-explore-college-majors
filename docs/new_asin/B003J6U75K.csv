8472954,3,B003J6U75K,"I loved this show, thats why I ordered it, the quality is okay considering it was made before DVD's were even a thing, my only problem with it is that some scenes were cut off (Probably to make it more less mature), like that scene when Onizuka was giving Kikuchi pictures of girls to transpose heads too, and the Fuyutsuki pics he's done.

Over all its an okay product, even if some scenes were taken out you can still get the story, and I am still touched by it even today",1470960000,,474,4.208791208791209
