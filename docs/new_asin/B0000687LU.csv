7964107,3,B0000687LU,"STRIPPED is a mildly interesting documentary in which film maker Jill Morley profiles several women from different backgrounds who are strippers, and the circumstances in their lives that led them to this line of work. Morley herself decides to try dancing. When she goes in to try out as a dancer the guy who does the auditions has ""sleazeball"" written all over him. She soon experiences first hand how pathetic some men can be around topless dancers. (Sure, I've made my share of comments about breasts and buttocks in some of my reviews but I'm not about to treat ANYBODY like that. Believe it or not, The Vidiot is actually quite a nice guy). The women's eventual paths are not all rose tinted either, one dies during cosmetic surgery while another mysteriously disappears; reportedly murdered by a cult. Sobering stuff. While STRIPPED is not up to the standards of some other documentaries in the same vein, it is still worth a look.",1042848000,,938,4.796296296296297
