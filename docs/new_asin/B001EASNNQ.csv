3547674,3,B001EASNNQ,"Well I purchased the movie as a gift, I thought this item would be perfect considering it came with a digital copy; however the person I purchased this for called me telling me that the digital copy expired.... soo I basically spent those extra dollars for nothing, if I'd of known I could've just purchased the dvd and saved a few bucks. The retailer of this item should let people know this before purchasing, or take it off the site completely!!!!!!!!",1293494400,5,454,4.617283950617284
3547675,1,B001EASNNQ,"I love the movie so I decided to buy the DVD, but it doesn't even work properly. Part of the special features does not work and the digital copy expired in September of 2010 already so it does not let you download!",1292803200,3,214,4.119047619047619

3547680,4,B001EASNNQ,This DVD comes with a free digital copy which is downloadable.  Great bonus.  I wasn't aware of that and therefore wasn't expecting a cardboard case.  It was a gift for a child so I would have preferred the hard plastic case but it wasn't a big issue.,1239062400,7,251,4.297872340425532

8297337,3,B001EASNNQ,"When I first received this item in the package, I thought there was some kind of error. The DVD case is very thin, and the 'Digital Copy' banner shown in the photo here on Amazon is straight across the top of my copy with no other words like 'included' or 'free' or something that would make me think it wasn't just labeling the contents of the entire package.  It makes it look like it was not intended for resale and was meant to be half of a set. I was concerned that only a digital copy would be in the case because of how generic it looked.

It is indeed the full film and extras plus the digital copy, but I'd wish I'd known to expect a thin weirdly designed case!

Content-wise, the DVD boasts more than is technically there.  The 'Featurette' and 'Anastasia: A Magical Journey' extras contain almost exactly the same material, differing only in narration and two or three tiny interview clips.  They also look very much their age and like they were recorded from television on VHS, but given the age of the material, the price of the DVD, and that it's likely no one ever thought these specials would need to be saved for high definition posterity, it's not that bad.

I wish I'd looked harder before purchasing a copy of this film, as a newer Blu-Ray combo pack may have had more/better features and more attractive packaging, but for under ten dollars, this is what you'd expect.",1397174400,,1389,4.470355731225297
8297338,5,B001EASNNQ,"whether you know the story of Anastasia or not, this is a great movie, with just enough fiction for the kiddos!",1387411200,,111,4.333333333333333
8297339,5,B001EASNNQ,"I loved this movie as a kid, I think it is absolutely great that it comes in Digital Copy! Everything about this movie is enjoyable & great for a movie night.",1363564800,,158,4.129032258064516
8297340,5,B001EASNNQ,"bought this for my little sister who'd had it on vhs when she was younger
