Performance:
Ava's routines are often hits and misses with me, either I love them or not there is no in between and I did not enjoy her performance. That being  said her skill and expressivity are undeniably good. She is the prime definition of making simple moves mesmerizing.

This dvd is not for complete beginner, but a solid introduction in belly dance will have you working with this dvd quite nicely. The instructions seemed decent to me but that will depend on where you are in your dance. If you do not already have an understanding of basic movements I would skip this dvd for now or buy and use later.

This would have more accurately been named Ava Flemings signature moves. I see her use a lot of these moves. Being thus if you do not like the way Ava dances I would probably skip this dvd as well unless you want some really graceful combo's. This dvd really speaks to her style of dance which is very much a mixture of tribal and cabaret. I do not own any other Ava Flemings dvd besides star combinations, so I cannot tell whether this information has a big overlap. The content was good. You got a good amount of combo's to work on and if doing the dvd  completely at a time you will really ingrain these movements.

The lighting was good. The amount of information given for the money spent was good. The instructions were good.

Cons:
There is no warm-up and some moves like the floor work can be knee intensive.

The only real problem with the dvd is the camera angles. She faces the mirror while teaching and in order to capture what  she is doing from the front the camera get close but I thought it would have been more beneficial for her to just turn around and face the viewer.  The Camera as well sometimes zoom in and the shot doesn't look good. For example her performance. The camera zoomed in cutting off some of her movements . It would have been better to put some space between the camera and her to get the full effect.

Overall I am glad for the purchase. It is one of those dvd's (For Me) that is not so difficult I get discouraged and not so easy I get bored .It was just right. I am glad that she integrates her  movements , for instance you did not see a movement drill it once but it was never brought back up, You will use some of the movements again. I feel the dvd flowed smoothly. The concepts were well put together and  besides the camera angles this dvd was a good buy.",1358035200,6,3092,4.47246891651865
8461456,5,B0058E8N84,"What can I say about Ava Fleming? Beautiful, mysterious, physically fit, gracious, fun....I have seen many videos of Ava and have seen her perform up close at Plaza de Anaya in Tempe, az. I always try to pay special attention to the ladies from my home state, Arizona. As usual Ms. Fleming instruction was very good. Easy to follow, though I don't bounce down to my knees. I can't get back up, LOL. I would recommend this dvd to my students and to DVD instructors. Its good to learn at least one new thing a day. Today I choose this dvd.",1343433600,2,537,4.326732673267327
