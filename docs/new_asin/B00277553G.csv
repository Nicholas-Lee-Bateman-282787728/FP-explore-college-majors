8354149,5,B00277553G,"I like all that I have seen and read by David Dunlop. His materials are very informative of the history of painting. He uses watercolor as Turner would before modern watercolor papers were invented. I would recommend viewing his free videos on you tube before purchasing his videos. I bought the used video for twenty something and found it to be of fair value. David is brilliant, studied, a good painter, and an entertainer.",1391990400,,426,4.77027027027027
8354150,3,B00277553G,"I learned a lot but not the HOW TO...
So I will look for other art instructors that explain all the steps.
I enjoyed the history and composition teaching and it was worth the price.
Thank you

8354151,2,B00277553G,"After getting excited about a new watercolor video by a so called expert, I was really disappointed. He knows his art history, but he paints with watercolor as if it were oil or acrylic. Most of his methods would make a true watercolor artist cringe. It's also a little slow listening to him and he seems a bit full of himself. There are some really great watercolor DVDs out there, this is not one of them.",1338508800,2,407,4.368421052631579

Art students and teachers as well as amateur and professional artists will enjoy these clearly explained and perfectly paced videos by Dunlop, a classically trained artist with a Master of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute in New York City. He discusses basic supplies (various styles of brushes, types and colors of paint), the mechanics of selecting colors, and the variety of brush strokes that can be used to produce unique, inspiring paintings. Each of these videos has a section devoted to painting plein-air or out in the field. Watercolor includes a short history of watercolor painting, covering classical and modern styles. Classical music serves as a pleasant and inspirational background. Dunlop includes highlights of art history in his narration as well as motivation for the student painter. Each video concludes with stills of Dunlop's method to illustrate the evolution of the process. Judiciously edited and technically well photographed, these videos will help artists learn and improve their techniques; recommended for public, academic, and secondary school libraries. -Susan C.
