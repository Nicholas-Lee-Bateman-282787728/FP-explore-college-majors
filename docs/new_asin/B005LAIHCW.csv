4731291,5,B005LAIHCW,"I don't know what some of these people are talking about.  There was nothing predictable about this movie.  I am a huge thriller/horror fan.  I've seen everything and lately there hasn't been anything good coming into the theater's.  Typically you watch five minutes of a movie and you know how it will end.  I thought it would be the same with this movie.  IT ISN'T!  It's awesome!  Jennifer Lawrence does a GREAT job!!!  Loved this movie...in the theater....and can't wait to go and see it again.  It is a definite ""must see"" if you are a horror movie fan!!!",1348704000,47,560,4.565656565656566
4731292,3,B005LAIHCW,"When you're a parent of two young children, you take your dates with your spouse whenever you have babysitters. So a visit from grandparents meant that we were going to see a movie - any movie - and ""House at the End of the Street"" (HATES) was the winner.

The movie begins with the delectable Elisabeth Shue (who will always Chris Parker from Adventures in Babysitting for me) as Sarah, a toned newly divorced mom starting her life over with daughter Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence, who up close has a peculiar face) in a new neighborhood that just happens to be nearby a murder house. Years earlier, Carrie-Ann (Eva Link) murdered her parents (Krista Bridges and John Healey) in their beds. The only survivor is Ryan (Max Thieriot), raised by a dottering old aunt. Now Ryan continues to live in the house, planning to fix it up, and of course Elissa is attracted to him because he's so soulful, sad, and damaged. Like a defanged version of Edward Cullen, without all the bloodsucking.

What's so refreshing about HATES is how it hides in plain sight. We see early on that Ryan's actually keeping Carrie-Ann in a hidden room beneath the house. In a twist on the traditional horror tropes, Carrie-Ann regularly escapes and charges towards the nearest house with Ryan in hot pursuit trying to stop her from murdering poor unsuspecting Elissa.

Elissa is a talented musician, so it's not long before she makes friends and enemies when she rejects the advances of reigning rich kid Tyler (Nolan Gerard Funk) advances. Things get dangerous when Tyler decides to publicly beat up Ryan at the battle of the bands and someone snaps someone else's ankle like a twig. And that's the moment when things go sideways.

HATES has to be creative with its PG-13 rating, which means that people get stabbed but rarely bleed. Instead, the audio is cranked up so that we hear every groan of agony. There's also less jump-out-of-your-seat scares and more disturbing interactions in which the long, sad history of the murder house is peeled back, layer by layer.

HATES is not a great film. Characters do stupid things, archetypes act like stereotypes, and Ryan is so sappy-sad that after awhile you just want to give him some ice cream. But despite its formulaic approach and Lawrence's occasional lapses, HATES is surprisingly fearless...perhaps because it has nothing to lose.

This is what horror looks like in an era post-""Scream."" It has to be sneaky by showing you the horror without letting you know what you're seeing. And in that regard HATES still has some tricks up its sleeve for jaded horror fans.",1348444800,5,2586,4.813063063063063
4731293,2,B005LAIHCW,"Just saw ""House at the End of the Street"" aka ""HATES"" in a crowded theater. So many people came I even saw two girls sitting on the stairs. As for the movie well......I really wanted to like this movie, because it's JENNIFER LAWRENCE. But what I got was a wimpy mediocre PG-13 horror film for people who can't handle R-Rated horror films. The only thing good about the movie was the audiences. Yes the audiences was more entertaining and more compelling than anything I saw on screen. Don't go see ""HATES"" in a theater. Wait until rental IF your JENNIFER LAWRENCE fan.",1348358400,7,568,4.578431372549019
4731294,1,B005LAIHCW,"""House at the End of the Street"" suffers from the same lame attempts at scaring you that ""Insidious."" While the music cues aren't there, there's more than its fair share of loud noises to try and make you jump. Jump scares are really just awful, especially since you can see most of them coming a mile away. People don't seem to realize that that isn't horror. Being startled and being scared are two entirely different things.

Once you get past that, the horror-thriller is very generic with the urban myth like storytelling becoming a reality and the main character doing something she knows she shouldn't and it coming back to bite her in the ass by the time the climax rolls around. The storyline is very clich and one you've seen done dozens of times before.

Even the way the movie is edited drips with douchebaggery as every shot starts off blurry and slowly transitions into a more focused shot. It even has this annoying shaking effect every once in awhile with irritating sound effects to try and creep you out. Things like flashlights not working when they need to or not being able to find the keys to the car when someone is being chased is thrown in to really make the predictable factor really sink in.

There are a few worthwhile segments in the movie; the main one being the dinner scene with Elissa, Sarah, and Ryan. It's funny, dramatic, and pretty intense. It's easily the best scene in the movie. The twist is kind of interesting, too; interesting in a way that kind of ruins the Ryan character of the movie. There is also one of the quickest death scenes in history. Somebody dies like immediately after they're stabbed. It's just really peculiar.

""House at the End of the Street"" is just an excuse to cash in on Jennifer Lawrence's recent success and to look down her shirt for an hour and forty minutes. If you must see it, wait to rent it as it really isn't worth the price of today's movie ticket prices. It's as if it's a combination of ""House of Wax"" and ""The Last House on the Left"" in title and in story, but its content isn't nearly as graphic. The remake of ""The Stepfather"" also comes to mind. Everything is so predictable that it doesn't really offer anything remotely worthwhile. This is the type of run of the mill, cookie cutter, PG-13, piss poor excuse of a horror movie that horror fans always complain about over the internet.",1348272000,14,2368,4.551643192488263
4731295,5,B005LAIHCW,"Sarah has been recently divorced and she has searched for a new beginning with her daughter, Elissa. They search for the house of their dreams and are happy with one they chose in a small, rural town. But, unexpected events begin to happen and Sarah and Elissa discover that the town is hiding some kind of chilling secret. It has been known that the house next to Sarah many years earlier had a horrible murder take place as a daughter killed her parents and vanished, leaving one sole survivor, a brother. His name is Ryan and against Sarah's wishes, he begins to date Elissa. The closer they become in their relationship, the More dangerous it gets as they are pulled into a terrifying mystery. This thriller is very dramatic and eerie with intense suspense. Who survives the nightmare at the 'House At The End Of The Street?' Great acting performance and edge-of-your-seat suspense. Highly Recommended for thriller, mystery, and horror lovers!",1348185600,54,947,4.888198757763975

Jennifer Lawrence plays guitar and sings a little bit.  ...decent voice and guitar skills.. I think her voice is arousing.  She has that deep, sexy voice when she sings, which turns me on.

Aside from her tight white tank top and very tight jeans, she almost convinced me that she was truly into her role.  There were moments that I felt she was too academic,  Anyway, her acting is good, but she did better in Selena.  'Could've used a couple ""panty"" shots in the film.  She needs to be more daring in the ""revealing"" category.",1455926400,,607,4.504587155963303

4732408,4,B005LAIHCW,"Young Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence) and her mother Sarah (Elizabeth Shue) think they are moving into a quiet, uneventful new home to reconnect and start over. The house next door is supposed to be empty, but late one night Sarah sees a light go on in the allegedly vacant edifice. Turns out a young man does live there, in the very house where his crazy sister murdered their parents years before. The townsfolk think young Ryan is crazy for staying in the house all by himself, but Elissa thinks differently. Elissa is drawn to Ryan's quiet, sensitive nature, and perhaps also by the chance to draw him out of his shell. But the local legend is that Ryan's sister is still out there somewhere, watching and waiting for another chance to strike

Don't think of House at the End of the Street as a slasher film. True, the story could work as a slasher, but director Mark Tonderai has created a film that rises above many of the usual genre clichs. The story is well-written and built around mystery and suspense rather than cheap shocks, and even though most of the main characters are teenagers, the film doesn't take them down the usual paths.

The cast is outstanding. Jennifer Lawrence makes Elissa likable but not without flaws. She is smart and caring, brave and resourceful, and in many ways an atypical teenager, but all the same a young woman who makes some bad decisions throughout the movie, decisions that may have lethal consequences for herself and others. In short, she's a great protagonist that is easy to identify with. Elizabeth Shue likewise does well as Sarah, plagued by paranoia and too much drink but determined to forge a stronger relationship between her daughter and herself...if she doesn't drive her away forever first. Max Thieriot handles the touchy role of Ryan just right, capturing all the nuances of a town outcast living under the shadow of an urban legend with surprising deftness. Together, the performers ensure the story seems populated by real people of flesh and blood.

In some ways, House at the End of the Street echoes that great classic of horror cinema, Psycho. Of course, the current film isn't nearly as good as Psycho, but there are a lot of shared elements which can't entirely be coincidental. Compared to many other horror films, House at the End of the Street may seem a bit bloodless, but that's only because the filmmakers realize it takes more to make a good movie than lots of bloodshed. House at the End of the Street is a fine horror film that delivers the scares without sacrificing good sense.",1438128000,,2552,4.743243243243243

4732710,5,B005LAIHCW,"I like to watch early movies of actors and actresses before they were anyone, and this 2011 movie fills the bill.  Lawrence really needs direction, she often brings it on her own, but some of her scenes, especially the ones where she acts ""concerned"" or ""making it"" with the male lead are really bad --there's just no chemistry there.  It's good to see Therioux (?) work pre Bates Motel, if this predated same, it surely helped him get the gig.

But all the protagonist ""teenagers"" have more maturity than college grads, it just doesn't sell the fact that these are supposed to be kids.  Kids who actually wind up being ""right"" all along, I may add.

All the characters and the actors that portrayed them, is let down by a script with more plotholes than NY potholes after a freak snow storm.

So the five stars are for the film buffs out there.  Your next ""requirement"" people, is to screen Serena.  Lawrence did that ""weepie"" after this ""creepie"".  Get to it.",1426032000,,961,4.573099415204679

4732878,4,B005LAIHCW,"House At the End of the Street is not a typical scary movie.  It has all the typical scary components with a little twist at the end that no one will see coming.  The music, camera work, acting, and scary scenes all make this movie one that will keep you guessing and thinking throughout the movie, and even after it is all finished.
 The lighting, music, and camera work all add to the creepiness of the movie.  The lighting is either very dim or flashes in and out.  For example, at one part of the movie all that can be seen is the small light of a flashlight moving around the room with eerie music in the background.  Suddenly the music stops and Ryan (Max Thieriot) jumps out, taking your breath away and causing your heart to beat a little faster.  The camera work focuses in on the most important parts of the scene so the audience never sees who or whats about to pop out next. The door of the room where Carrie Ann (Eva Link) lives is intently zoomed in and focused on, so you're surprised when she quickly bursts out of the door.  The camera work also has a way of making it seem like the characters are being watched, which makes things more suspenseful for the viewers.
 The acting in this movie is nothing spectacular, but its not horrible.  The audience can really feel Elissas (Jennifer Lawrence) struggle to get out of the wrist and feet restraints that Ryan has put on her, because of the tone of her voice and the desperation in her face.  Ryan convinces the audience that he is innocent in this whole story by using a very quiet, gentle, and calm tone.  However, when he interacts with other characters from the movie, he does a less convincing job.  For example, when he tries to explain to Elissas mother and the police officer that Elissa is not with him, he doesnt make eye contact and cant keep his calm, cool, and collected tone and facial expression.  The audience would know that he was lying even if they hadnt just seen him take Elissa into Carrie Anns room.  Lastly, the acting of Carrie Ann wasn't too convincing, which makes her character seem not so spooky.  She walks hunched over, but then when she escapes from her room, all of a sudden she can run up-right and fast.  Not very convincing for the audience that she has brain damage and hasn't been allowed out of her tiny room in the basement ever since she went crazy and killed her parents.
 Some parts of this film were stereotypical of a scary movie.  Both Elissa and her mom notice signs of suspiciousness of the house (they live next door), but neither one does anything or tells anyone.  Of course, the main character falls in love with the bad boy and doesnt notice all of the signs that point to something suspicious.  For instance, Ryan has a table full of childrens food and pictures of little stick people plastered onto the fridge.  After Elissa finds out that Carrie Ann is real, she hears noises coming from the basement.  She goes down to check it out, even though she knows that Carrie Ann has killed two people.  The audience silently pleads with her not to go downstairs, but she has to, because there always has to be one person thats brave.
 Overall, I enjoyed this movie because of its very suspenseful, thrilling, and psychologically-packed scenes.  There were a few events that were predictable, but they did not overtake the movie as a whole.  I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a movie that will keep them on the edge of their seat and wonders if Carrie Ann was the one who really killed her parents",1411344000,,3525,4.475743348982785

4732883,5,B005LAIHCW,"Be you woman, or be you man (like me!), it's hard not to be jealous of Jennifer Lawrence. So perfectly beautiful, down-to-earth, pumping out top notch performances at such a young age...and now she goes and proves she can be as good a scream queen as the rest of them in this surprisingly original chiller that saves its dagger twist ending for the very last shot. It opens with a double kill scene where two very parental adults get killed by a little girl with a hammer and a lot of rage going on. It's four years later and Elissa (Lawrence) is moving with her mom into a beautiful house that goes cheap because next door is the one where that crazy little girl went on a spree. The official story is that the girl was Carrie Ann and she killed her parents. Her body was never found. Some say she drowned out by the dam. Oh, and she's survived by her brother, Ryan (Hangdog Max Thieriot), who's LIVING IN THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW! And when his light goes on at 3 am it makes a noise that only the audience and Elisabeth Shue can hear. Did I mention Elisabeth Shue is in this movie as Elissa's mom Sarah? So cool.
Any way, Elissa is one to really go for the underdog, and when she sees everybody, from local bully Tyler (Nolan Gerard Funk) to Elissa's own mom picking on him, beating on him, making him feel like an outcast, well, daring Elissa practically serves herself to Ryan on a plate...but he shoves her out of the house all of a sudden.
Well, we know why. Because, see, Carrie Ann didn't drown. He's got her locked in his cellar. All this serves to make him even more sympathetic. We even learn that he blames himself for the brain damage she received as a child when she fell from a swing set. And see, that night, when Elissa was all hot to trot, Carrie Ann had cunningly procured the key and escaped her basement cell... and Carrie Ann's a dangerous murderer, right?

Sarah can only afford the place because the house is close to another house where a girl stabbed to death her parents. Soon Elissa befriends the outcast college student Ryan, who inherited the house from his parents, and she falls in love with him. But Ryan secretly keeps his sister captive in the basement using drugs to control her. One night, Elissa snoops around Ryan's house and she discloses dark secrets about her boyfriend.""

House at the End of the Street (2012) **
D: Mark Tonderai
C: Jennifer Lawrence, Max Thieriot, Elisabeth Shue, Gil Bellows, Eva Link, Nolan Gerard Funk, Allie MacDonald
P: Teenage girl (Lawrence) and her mother (Shue), seeking out a fresh start, move to a small town. There, they become intertwined in a mystery surrounding one of their neighbors - a teenage boy (Thieriot) whose family was murdered by his sister, who then mysteriously disappeared.

House at the End of the Street is pretty much a TV movie in dress clothes. With a slightly larger budget and a raising actress (Lawrence), it got a major theatrical release while similar films would have either aired on TV or been released straight to DVD.

The script is by the numbers. All the answers to the mystery that the film is spinning are rather obvious, so therefore a lot of potential suspense has been removed as well. Production values are average at best, though the entire cast does a competent job. It's just that we've seen this type of film so many times and this one doesn't even attempt to do anything to separate itself from all the others that came before it. House at the End of the Street is bland, forgettable and uneventful, but then again, what do you expect of a PG-13 rated horror film released in September with minimum ad support from its distributor?!?

American films are in a real rut and desperately need refreshing, unique storylines like some of the foreign film makers are doing.  When they DO make a good film often times the stories are borrowed from a successful foreign film, I've noticed.

The actors are good in this movie.  They have real talent.  The material is just mundane and inane.  When people are hit in the head with a hammer folks, they don't have clean faces and they don't get up unharmed for scene two.  A little realism here directors, unless you're making a FREDDIE'S NIGHTMARE movie where he can't die no matter what.

This is not the case in this movie at all. The main lead, Jennifer, kicks BUTT. Yeah, she makes mistakes (honestly, I'm pretty sure we all would slip up) but she fights back so well that I sometimes forgot that I was watching a movie.

4733516,2,B005LAIHCW,"House at The End of The Street is another ambitious, low budget, Horror film, that tries to make a name for itself by using star power, but how much was I really expecting from a PG-13 Horror film? The story begins when Elissa and her mother move to a new house in the country, a house that is across the street from the scene of a grizzly double murder four years earlier. The house and story is surrounded by rumors and still occupied by the son of the victims, who Elissa quickly befriends. Once again we have a common theme that has been done to death, but the producers of this film were hoping that by spending big bucks on Jennifer Lawrence (Hunger Games) and Max Thieriot (Bates Motel) that they could get people to watch their film and it worked, but I suspect most people were sadly disappointing like I was. The acting was terrific and everything you would expect from these actors, but the story was so simple and predictable that it really wasn't worth watching. Being a PG-13 film didn't help either as there wasn't really anything too horrific or creepy to really catch your attention. If that wasn't bad enough, the first hour of the film was so slow, that I almost turned it off. The only thing that kind of gave me a laugh was that there was a lot of scenes with Jennifer Lawrence in the woods and I couldn't help but think that Katniss wished she had her bow. House at The End of The Street is a film that has the star power, but not much else, as it's a slow, tame, predictable film, that's been done and it leaves far too many unanswered questions. If you're a die hard Jennifer Lawrence fan, check it out, otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time on this one.",1369526400,2,1676,4.357827476038339

4733616,1,B005LAIHCW,"Lets make one thing clear. The only people voting this movie 5 and 4 stars are fans of Jennifer Lawrence and Hunger Games. You won't see an in depth review but you will see Jennifer Lawrence is so great yadda yadda! On any positive review about this terrible movie. With that said how about an actual review of this film for once.

 This movie has been done to death. It's predictable because you've seen it before and therefore becomes not that interesting of a film to watch. The film doesn't sell the story so well because it feels like you're watching a movie. The acting is terrible and like a cheesy daytime soap opera. When the star of the movie is Jennifer Lawrence what more can you expect. Hunger games had terrible acting and so did this movie. Bringing a so so actor into a cheesy horror film doesn't make the movie better. If this film didn't star someone with a mindless fan base already This would probably be an average 3 or 2 star horror film.

So why am I getting on Jennifer Lawrence's case? Well it's because a bad horror film doesn't deserve instant 5 stars because you're favorite actor is in it. I like Nicholas Cage but I'm not going to give the Wicker Man 5 stars just because he was in it (even though I did like that film a lot). I also like Milla Jovovich but I'm not going to give Resident Evil a 5/5 just because she starred in it? So what's the point of ignoring how bad a movie is and giving a hyper inflated review score because you're favorite actor is in it?

Enough of my rant let me talk about the movie now...

 The movie is about a teenage girl and her mother who move to nice neighborhood after a divorce. Jennifer lawrence and her mother don't get a long because her mother is emotionally unstable and spent her time being a friend to her daughter instead of acting like a parent. Jennifer is introduced to the neighborhood kids and makes a few friends at school. One day after going to a party she runs in to Ryan the boy who lives in the house across the way. Ryan's parents were murdered and he moved into the house after they died or so the story is. The entire town seems to dislike Ryan and spreads rumors about him for his parents being murdered and his decided to live in their home instead of moving out and selling it (what a way to treat a victim). Ryan offers Jennifer a ride home and she soon begins to befriend and fall in love with him. The problem is that Ryan is keeping a big secret in his house (soo spooky). To which we find that his sister Carrie Ann is still alive and is locked up in his sub basement (don't worry that's not a spoiler to this film it's revealed in the first 10 minutes). That's about the only interesting part of the film. The fact that Carrie Ann is still alive after committing the murders and being looked after by her brother BUT THEN! the writers take that great plot and opportunity to create a truly unique and interesting horror story and throw it out the window. At the end of the film you feel cheated,unsatisfied and completely let down. What starts off as a potentially interesting movie turns out to be just another been there done that type of horror film. There really is nothing to write home about in this film other than ""Wow that could have been good why did they go and do that?"" The film literally ends with a snap. Once you hear it you start to realize that the film just killed a good plot.

Overall if you want to watch this film because Jennifer Lawrence and her terrible acting is in it you'll probably enjoy it. If you're a horror fan like me looking for a good film to watch THIS IS NOT IT!",1368835200,6,3599,4.283823529411765

""House at the end of the Street"" takes original ideas and creates an interesting story, yet it is still unoriginal.

The villain could have been better I think. When I found out who the villain was, this person didn't strike me as scary enough to pull off the suspense the movie attempts to create. In other words, the villain didn't seem to be much of a threat in the end. Yes, the villainous stuff was demented. It was still suspenseful. No, it wasn't really that scary. The acting on the part of the villain was not good enough to convince me or make me feel afraid. The story was good but nothing surprising.

4733747,2,B005LAIHCW,"I watched the uncut version, which said it contained a ""shocking twist,"" but I didn't see any twist. The uncut version was 3 minutes longer than the theatrical version, but where was the twist?

The House at the End of the Street belonged to Carrie Ann's parents. Carrie Ann is a young girl with very large legs (and arms) and long hair hanging in her face. She gets out of bed one night and kills her parents. Then, the story goes, she is drowned in a dam, but her body isn't found.

Teenage Elissa and her (divorced?) mother Sarah move into a rent house close to the murder house. They can afford the rent due to the murder. Neighbors complain that the house brings down their property value.

Sarah is perhaps a radiological technician (she's always looking at xrays) at her job at the hospital. She seems to always work the night shift, leaving Elissa alone in the huge house with big windows that have no coverings.

After leaving a party one night, Elissa meets Ryan, who it turns out is Carrie Ann's brother, who was sent away (why?) to live with an old aunt. After his parents were killed, he came back to the house to fix it up and sell it. He's a bit quiet and nervous, but Elissa finds him intriguing (since all the other guys at her school are jerks). However, her mother gets a weird vibe off Ryan. But Elissa is fed up with mother due to her prior bad acts (not sure exactly what those were).

The cop at the hospital (apparently the only cop in town, and he's always at the hospital, doing security guard duty, but he can leave any time he wants to), tells Sarah that Ryan was living with the old aunt and taking care of her. She had a stroke, and when his parents died, he moved back to the house with his aunt. She then died a year ago. So did anyone see the aunt?

However, Ryan tells Elissa that his aunt died and THEN he moved back to the house. He says he inherited the house and has enough money to pay the bills, etc. Doesn't go into any of the probate stuff about how he had to prove his sister was dead to be the only heir.

Turns out Ryan is keeping a big secret. Carrie Ann is really alive, and he has her locked up in a room, below the basement. Yes, there is another basement below the basement. There is a bed, and a sink. She doesn't care to be locked up, and usually escapes, with her long hair hanging in her face, her trusty butcher knife in hand.  At one point, she runs off with some amazingly ugly moccasin-type houseshoes on her feet, below those very large legs. Que feo.

When Carrie Ann gets riled up, Ryan gives her a shot of something, that calms her right down. And every time, when he gets finished giving her the shot, he throws the syringe.  Where does he get these drugs and syringes?

The rest of the film is the predictable last-minute rush to save the victim, etc. Elissa has apparently not paid attention to any scary movie. You know, when you think the killer is dead, but they  never are? That isn't scary any more.

SPOILERS: I have some questions.  His mother was on illegal drugs. Carrie Ann dies in a swing accident. His father buries her. Why? If they were afraid of calling the police to the house, why didn't they just take her to the hospital? Just to make sure she's dead? Since they loved her so much, that they made their son take on her personality, and made him into a girl - wouldn't they want to see if MAYBE something could be done for her? Why did they prefer Carrie Ann over Ryan? Why did they BOTH go for this ridiculous idea? How could they not see that this denial of his identity was driving Ryan so insane that he was grunting and screaming and had his hair hanging in his face, and was a whole lot of trouble to try to control? And very dangerous to them?(Ryan told Elissa that brain-damage made Carrie Ann ""aggressive"" - so he did have some self-insight.) Was it really worth it to make their living son into their dead daughter?

Also, was he home-schooled or what? How did he go from being crazy, murderous Carrie Ann, to ""normal"" Ryan? Why did he want to replace Carrie Ann, when he'd been forced to BE Carrie Ann for so many years?

And why was the cop so creepy and suspicious-appearing, as though he were a bad guy?

Lots of psychological background was left out. To give some explanation would have made this a better movie.

Edit: Well, I looked up to find out what the twist was, and it wasn't on my uncut version. The cop was taking drugs with the parents and the father told him he'd have to go along with it (after he'd buried Carrie Ann). Still don't get why they couldn't say Carrie Ann died, and why Ryan had to be turned into Carrie Ann.",1367193600,3,4632,4.280320366132723

First, the two female leads, Ms. Lawrence and Ms. Shue, have three Oscar nominations and one win between them. You would have to  go back decades for a cast with this amount of industry acclaim. And unlike typical Hollywood casting, they play mother and daughter and look the part. This  movie is in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" So no real surprises, but the director  does generate considerable suspense. The director is no Hitchcock, but who else is? Ms.  Lawrence's statuesque beauty and natural acting talent are impressive and palpable. One cautionary note: Ms. Lawrence's foul-mouth bravado can't hide the insecurity, bewilderment and vulnerability that are just below the surface. Remember how Ms. Lindsay Lohan self-destructed and she has similar talent and beauty.

4733963,1,B005LAIHCW,"Remember ""Disturbia""? It had the gall to reimagine Alfred Hitchcock's classic ""Rear Window"" as a teen slasher movie, starring a pre-""Transformers"" Shia Labeouf in James Stewart's stead.

Why do I bring this up? Because ""House at the End of the Street"" might as well be a sequel to ""Disturbia,"" since it takes the same tack of trying to turn a classic Hitchcock movie into a teen horror movie. The one thing that it has going for it is that instead of Shia Labeouf, this movie has the always-wonderful Jennifer Lawrence -- and at times, she feels like its sole saving grace.

Elissa Cassidy (Lawrence) and her newly-divorced mom Sarah (Elisabeth Shue) have just moved into their dream home, in an idyllic upper-crust community full of selfish snobs. Elissa isn't particularly enthusiastic about their new life, but she quickly makes some friends and even is recruited into a rock band at her school (which allows Jennifer Lawrence a chance to show off her lovely singing voice).

But there's a dark side to their neighborhood. Four years ago, Carrie Ann Jacobson slaughtered her parents and seemingly drowned herself -- and now the only living member of the family is Ryan (Max Thieriot), a shy young man who is despised by the whole neighborhood. Why? He's driving their property values down. Seriously.

Despite Sarah's wishes, Elissa becomes intrigued by Ryan, and even sneaks off to spend time with him in his abandoned house. But Elissa doesn't know what Ryan has been hiding in the basement, and what might happen if she were to learn the secrets he's been keeping. When she figures out the truth, Elissa becomes a prisoner facing a fate worse than death.

""House at the End of the Street"" is a pretty shameless ripoff of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" minus the stuff that was (and is) actually shocking. In fact, director Mark Tonderai seems kind of uncomfortable with incorporating some of that stuff into the story -- he's particularly clumsy with the ""mental illness"" and ""cross-dressing"" aspects -- but is all too happy to blatantly rip off some parts of it (the final scene).

Then again, those moments tend to be the most effective in the movie. Tonderai isn't much of a director, with no real style to his work -- he just follows Lawrence around while scary music plays. Also: blonde girls running through the woods at night ARE NOT SCARY.

And as a story, ""House"" is resolutely mediocre -- it's standard Hollywood suspense populated by stock characters, with a lot of narrative contrivances tied together in so many knots. The dialogue is weak, and a number of the characters really have no reason to be in the movie. For instance, why is Elissa's new best friend in here again? The character adds nothing, and she fades out completely in the second half of the movie.

As the final indignity, major plot points turn into gaping plot holes -- for instance, we NEVER find out why the sheriff is so desperate to protect Ryan. It's just a dramatic device that collapses on itsefl

The one saving grace of this movie is Lawrence, who is doing a pretty phenomenal job with a fairly standard horror heroine -- she comes across as a clever but overconfident girl who doesn't know quite as much as she thinks she does. Shue just stand around looking worried. And Thieriot's entire performance is a third-rate Tony Perkins impression -- it's so obvious just from his performance what is going on!

""House at the End of the Lane"" is an embarrassingly clunky movie, imitating random parts of ""Psycho"" but tailoring it to Mark Tonderai's limited skills. Lawrence is the only good thing about this clot of misery.",1364256000,5,3613,4.812903225806451

HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET does a fine job of following the good ol' psycho-horror flick formula. Attractive and popular high school senior Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence of HUNGER GAMES fame) and her mother (very well-played by Elisabeth Shue) move into a house next door to the infamous one where the parents were murdered by their own ""daughter,"" Carrie Anne, three years earlier. (No one knows for sure what happened to ""Carrie Anne"" afterward.) Anyhoo, Jennifer enters into a forbidden friendship with Carrie Anne's older brother, Ryan, who still lives in the murder house. Though pale, strange, withdrawn Ryan is disliked and antagonized by Elissa's rowdy classmates, he seems nice and simply misunderstood at first. But wait, there's more to the story. . .

Despite many attempts at tension and foreboding, the first hour is uneventful and difficult to get through. Nevertheless, there are some tried-and-true horror flick twists and revelations towards the end. Some violence and gore, but even the unrated version is quite tame.

4734223,1,B005LAIHCW,"This movie has a formula that grows more common each year. All male characters are shown in the worst ways. No good males in the movie.

Jennifer Lawrence and Elisabeth Shue star as mother and daughter - Elissa Cassidy and Sarah Cassidy.
Sarah is newly divorced. Elissa's dad isn't even shown.  At the beginning Elissa and Sarah moved into a new house alone. Sarah started a new school, and met new kids.  The other girls were shown as silly and uninteresting, the audience was meant to only care about Sarah and Elissa.

The main male characters are Ryan Jacobson, Officer Bill Weaver, and Tyler Reynolds.  Tyler was shown as both a drug user and a stupid pig. Ryan was the villain of the movie.  Officer Bill Weaver was shown as corrupt and incompetent, also he had been covering for Ryan.

Ryan was at first shown as a quiet and withdrawn boy. Elissa was drawn to Ryan quickly. They made a cute pair. Sarah told her that she can't changed him. Sarah's marriage had failed, and she believed her daughter could do no better.  The possibilities were strong at that point. This could have ended with romance and love. That didn't happen.

Later it was revealed he had a girl named Carrie-Anne trapped in his basement. That had been the name of his sister, and this girl seemed disturbed and violent. Ryan appeared to be caring for his disturbed Sister.  Elissa eventually learned how damaged and dangerous Ryan was, the girl wasn't really Carrie-Anne, he just believed she was. He'd abducted her to replace his dead his sister.  After Elissa learned Ryan was insane she ended up kidnapped herself.

Eventually Sarah shows up, and they save each other. At the end Sarah and Elissa were leaving. The movie's ending is also far to common - Women and Girls alone, no Men and no Boys.  Sadly many people think that's a happy ending,",1363564800,,1826,4.651090342679128
4734224,3,B005LAIHCW,"This fairly unoriginal movie had some great acting, some great twists but was forgettable. Jennifer Lawrence is, of course, amazing and top notch and truly saves the movie, without her I'm fairly certain this movie would have fell flat on its face.

I was expecting to hate this movie, it looked awful from the previews, no one had said anything good about it and it just didn't sound that interesting. However, I redboxed it to give it a try and found myself a little surprised by how good it turned out to be. The plot starts out standard enough but becomes more original as it goes on and even has a few things that happen that I didn't see coming but beyond the few twists and great acting from Lawrence the rest of the movie is pretty forgettable. the main reason to watch this movie is for Lawrence  because of her acting as well as her character who refreshingly is more than just female fodder for a deranged screenwriter.

 I watched it two days ago and am having trouble remembering anything else that is significant but if you set the bar low and rent it for a dollar like I did then it's pretty good for a one time watch. I would have been displeased if I paid more or bought it.",1363564800,,1191,4.351351351351352

It turned out to be more of a ""kidnapping""/ thriller movie. I use thriller lightly because nothing about the movie kept me at the edge of my seat.

Probably not worth your time. But bad thrillers are a niche for some people, so this would probably fit in well. Teenagers might also find it OK at, like, a girl sleepover or something.

4734392,4,B005LAIHCW,"Let me just say that I saw this movie as a preview for another movie that I was watching. A movie that I can't even begin to tell you what it was, but after I saw this it peaked my interest. I wasn't really expecting too much because I got it cheap from the ""Big Red Box"" which is where I get a lot of movies now. That way, if the movies sucks, I don't own it, I'm not stuck with it, and I haven't paid that much to see it.

Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I haven't seen Elisabeth Shue in a minute, and I have always liked her as an actress. At any rate, I know some of these reviews tend to over-complicate the movie, so I'm going to keep my review straight forward. Nothing was how I expected it to be, and trust me, I am rarely surprised or shocked by any of these movies nowadays. Quite frankly, it was refreshing to see something not based on a comic book character, or characters, or a movie that looks like somebody grabbed a camera with nightvision and went into their own backyard and shot a movie. With that said, I will include spoilers, so if you don't want to know what happens skip me now...

First of all, it's really important that you pay attention to the flashback scenes because they explain a lot. Moving right on, the movie is about a 17-year-old girl named Alyssa (don't know if that's how they spelled it or not). Anyway, Alyssa and her mother have just moved to a new house. However, they are able to get this house really cheap because it's right next to a house where a girl supposedly murdered both parents with a hammer in the middle of the night. This girl is believed to be dead even though body was never found. Anyway, the house is suppose to be empty which was the lie the mother was told BEFORE she signed the lease only to find out afterward that the house does indeed have a current resident. She finds this out after she witnesses a light miraculously illuminate at 3:00 in the morning. The person that is living there is the eldest son of the murdered couple. Now, they say that he was suppose to be living with some Aunt he was taking care of when his sister murdered their parents, and now he's just back living in the house until he fixes it up and sells it which is what he said he was going to do.

This is pretty much the basis for the movie. There are few typical parts in between like the teen angst between mother and opinionated teenage daughter. There are times when you see clearly that Alyssa and her mother don't share a great relationship. There is no father around, her mother is never home, she pretty much raises herself, and her mother seems to have a drinking problem which you can tell by the way she was polishing off the bottle of wine at dinner. The mother comes across as disconnected from her daughter, and insensitive  to Ryan because despite his niceness she doesn't trust him with her daughter.

Moving further along, I will skip Alyssa and Ryan's introduction, the attempt at romance, or the relationship she was trying to start with a seemingly misunderstood, nice, respectful, guy who's just had a rough life. I don't know about anybody else, but there were many life lessons we hear about everyday in this movie: ""never get in the car with strangers,"" ""mother knows best,"" ""this is the guy your mother warned you about."" However, most teenagers at this age tend to think that they know everything about life and people in general. Those are the ones who most often wish they would have listened to their parents.

Moving even further along, you eventually find out that Ryan's sister is indeed alive, and that he has kept and been looking after his seriously mentally ill ""sister"" by keeping her locked and drugged up in the house. Now, the story that Ryan initially told from the beginning involved his little sister having a horrible accident on a swing set when they were kids. Thus, the head trauma being the reason she killed their parents. There isn't anyone who has watched this movie that can tell me that they knew what the twist was going to be at the end. We find out later on through flashbacks that much of Ryan's story was true, but what didn't tell Alyssa was that their lazy father was slumped in front of the television and their drug addicted mother getting high when his sister flipped backwards off the swing and bashed her head open. Then, he and his parents buried Alyssa and kept it a secret. The question was then.. who murdered the parents? Is it safe to say he did? Maybe?

I went through several endings myself while the events were unfolding, and found myself with a lot of unanswered questions, which all will be revealed in due time I tell you. I had pretty much figured out that the ""girl"", or should I say ""girls"", you thought were his sister that he was keeping down in the bowels of that house were not really his sister because if you paid attention after her caught her he broke her neck, but when Alyssa finds the room by being just a little too curious one night she finds a completely different girl. That's when this ""nice"" guy flips the script and shows his true colors. Ryan has been kidnapping girls forcing them to be his sister ""Carrie Anne."" I guess in his mind these girls were Carrie Anne, or they were going to be whether they liked it or not, and Alyssa is about to be his next ""Carrie Anne"" whether she likes it or not. Despite the fact that he actually likes her, but he ""needs"" to have another ""Carrie Anne"" more.

At this point, you realize that this guy is a loon. I mean, he is just plain crazy, and we assume it's from the fact that he feels responsible for Carrie Anne's death, and his part in burying her. That's still not all of it though. The final twist, which you see in the final flashback is that his parents were responsible for all this. Apparently, after Carrie Anne's death his parents lost it, blamed him for her death, and therefore decided that he was going to take her place and be their replacement ""Carrie Ann"" whether he liked it or not. I know that was enough to mess anybody up, but for a boy being made to play his own dead little sister was hell on Earth. Ryan's parents screwed him up, and he made them pay for it with that hammer. I guess in his mind ""Carrie Anne"" did kill them and the ""Carrie Anne"" was him.

Crazy, but that's what happened! This was a good movie that left my jaw on the floor.",1362182400,4,6378,4.361952861952862

4734543,1,B005LAIHCW,"By now, I'm sure anyone reading this is more than familiar with the plot, so let me tell you why you without a doubt  do NOT want to watch this,OK?

It's important to understand that House at the End of the Street is not really a Jennifer Lawrence movie, at least not in the sense that it's the Jennifer Lawrence we know from X-Men: First Class and Hunger Games. Lawrence was shooting House when Winter's Bone -- the movie that merited her an Oscar nomination -- came out, so it's a movie she agreed to do before anyone even knew that she'd one day be a major movie star. She was basically the teenager from the ""Bill Engval Show"" at the time, and the only thing that prevented this movie from being released straight-to-DVD was the fact that Hunger Games made Lawrence a star in the interim. Otherwise, it would've been a movie with a poster likely to feature a forest setting, a large shot of Elizabeth Shue's head, and a small one in the corner of Billy from ""Ally McBeal"" (Gil Bellows), all designed with MS Paint with a pull quote from blurbist  Pete Hammond. House wasn't screened for critics; the supporting cast is largely unknown, and the movie has been sitting on the shelf long enough to grow mold.  So, you don't need a Ph. D. in Common Sense to know what to expect from the film.

I've seen better DTV stuff from Lifetime than this one!

4734738,2,B005LAIHCW,"You would have thought with all the hype and those intense trailers for The House at the end of the Street(released Sept/12),that this film was going to be a sensational horror/mystery/occult thing-a-mabob. I mean who can tell sometimes exactly what it is one sees as far as plot possibilities go in these trailers. But that is the double edged sword in this industry. If you put out some really neat trailers and stuff,you're project better be able to live up to the hype. HES,unfortunately,does NOT follow through on its promises and falls pretty flat,pretty quickly. The film by the way showcases the talents of,among others,Jennifer Lawrence(Hunger Games)as Elissa Cassidy,Max Thieriot as Ryan Jacobson,Elisabeth Shue as Sarah Cassidy,and Gil Bellows as Officer Weaver.
The story finds Shue,a doctor,moving into a rental home,with her daughter Lawrence,a student. Their property backs onto a forest owned by the state,and temptingly sitting on the other side of it sits another house. It is a house with a sordid history. The parents young son and daughter,four years earlier,were out playing on swings,when the daughter fell off,survived,but was left with brain damage. One night the mother heard her daughter sleep walking and when she found her in the hall she attacked her mother and killed her with a hammer. She then went into her fathers room and did the same there. Fast forward to the present and the surviving son(Thieriot)still lives in the house. Shue finds this out after making inquiries when she spotted a light on there during the night.
As Lawrence returns to school and starts to make new friends,one of them turns out to be Thieriot himself. He seems a quiet and unassuming boy and he is atypical of the other hunks she's meeting at school. Right off she gravitates towards him and the two get close,much to the chagrin of her school chum and mother. However Thieriot has a secret. He has his sister locked up and drugged in a room downstairs. She manages to escape now and then but Thieriot manages to tackle her and bring her back. This Thieriot keeps hidden from Lawrence and the outside world as best he can.
One day Thieriot asks Lawrence to come by at which time he will tell her some things she needs to know. Before they can get together Thieriot is jumped at a band concert outside,is wounded but wounds another student severely and runs home. He abandons his car which Lawrence drives home,and good thing too. For some of the other guys who jumped Thieriot are there tossing a flaming roll of toilet paper through a front window. She gets inside and stops the potential engulfing fire from spreading. However in the garbage bin she spots some women's personal products,and thinking that it is odd,she starts to roam through the house. She eventually discovers the locked room and his sister inside. Thieriot arrives at that moment and asks Lawrence not to tell anyone. As she leaves he bonks her on the head,and when she awakes she is tied up in the same room as her sister. However this is not her sister. In fact her sister died the day she fell off the swing. Thieriot has been keeping her memory alive by kidnapping and holding hostage various local girls and calling them his sisters name,for the past four years. He now wants Lawrence to be the new Carrie Ann!
While all this has been happening Shue has been worried about her daughter and she sends Bellows over to investigate. Thieriot kills Bellows,and later,when Shue comes a calling he stabs her also. Lawrence is in the process of escaping and a cat and mouse game ensues. Shue ends up giving Thieriot the final knock out blow,and the two escape. The smoke clears and Shue and Lawrence are leaving town. The final shot is of Thieriot in an insane asylum,remembering his mother calling and telling HIM,he was his sister Carrie -Ann!
There are some pertinent question I have for the writers of this shindig. If Thieriot was kidnapping various girls to act as his sister,why weren`t their disappearances ever reported. If his sister really died that day on the swing,who exactly killed their parents. And what about the title. Thieriots house was,from all intents and purposes,through the woods. I suppose there was a road leading to it somewhere but it is never portrayed/seen to be on a street or even at its end. And as soon as I heard the name Carrie,I of course went back over 20 odd years to the movie of the same name(this is the drawback of reviewing,you get deja vu over,and over again!).I also have to say this plot was just SO plodding. The first 3/4 of an hour was spent with Shue and Lawrence settling into their environs and getting to know their neighbours,fellow workers/students,etc. They introduce Thieriot slowly and his secret even slower. But when all is said and done,and despite all the musical cues and deceptive shots and red herrings in the plot,there is still really nothing scary or terribly intense about this film. I found it flopped on many,many levels. Here we have a boy who had coke addicts for parents,who blame him for his sisters death,call him Carrie,which of course sends him to the dark side of the moon and turns him into a nut job. That`s the plot in a nutshell. Old and lame stuff by any measure.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. There are the theatrical and extended versions of the film included,nothing else. And nothing between either to make one any better than the other.
All in all a disappointment supremo. The actors did the best with what they had,but all they had was a cheesy plot artificially enhanced with the requisite haunting musical cues and usual misdirection. Nothing to see here folks!",1360281600,,5690,4.78942014242116

Great acting and superior storyline; well-written and directed cinema. There are parts I still have not pieced together but this is what I admire; a movie which requires multiple views yet still leaves me a bit baffled. Interpretations of certain pieces of this cinematic puzzle are intentionally left open-ended deliberately by the writer, thus there is no ""right"" answer for what actually occurs or what is reality during certain scenes. A very enjoyable and entertaining viewing experience, and in my opinion, this movie is worth owning. Last but certainly not least, Jennifer Lawrence is beautiful and is a great actress. I have also seen her in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and she was amazing, as well as sexy and alluring. I feel this young, new actress is going places; something tells me we will be seeing a lot more of her in the future. She may be the next ""Julia Roberts"" of this generation.

It's not a ""scary"" movie, which is what I think most people were expecting before they watched it, but a thriller. To me, it was an emotional movie, because I tried to put myself into Elissa's place and think about how it must feel to have feelings for somebody and then have all that stuff happen, especially considering that, aside from being kinda crazy, Ryan was sweet and deep and he seemed to genuinely care about her too. Or put yourself in Ryan's place: drug addict parents, accidentally killing your little sister while playing, being forced to replace her, being abused, the cop knowing about it but not helping you, having a whole town hate you for no reason (as they didn't know any of his secrets), and so on. Can y'all really blame him from cracking? His parents and the cop definitely had it coming.
Anyways, if I didn't just spoil the movie for you, I really recommend it. Jennifer Lawrence and Max Thieriot are both very talented and the story line is pretty good.",1360108800,,1105,4.502487562189055

4735016,2,B005LAIHCW,"I used to read R.L. Stine's horror books for teens back in the day. I think I devoured each one in a matter of hours. I knew, at the time, that they were cheesy -- rarely did they deviate from the same predictable formula -- but there was something guiltily pleasurable about them. Like the comedian Jim Gaffigan once said, ""I don't think 'cheesy' is a huge insult. When someone says a movie is cheesy, I always wonder, 'Mmmm. What kind of cheese?'""

I'm older now, though, and I don't have quite as much time on my hands. My tastes are a little more sophisticated (granted, not by much), and although I still love a little cheese now and then, it should still have a little consistency and flavor. This film -- cheesy galore -- has neither of those things. I was reminded instantly of the R.L. Stine books of my youth, and remembering those old patterns, I figured out the film's big plot twist within the first twenty minutes. This isn't me bragging, either. Anyone who's seen more than a dozen scary movies in their lifetime would be able to guess it. Or anyone who's ever read R.L. Stine.

In our story, Elisabeth Shue and her daughter (a girl with the personality of a bowl of milk) move into a house. At the end of the street is the home of a couple that was recently murdered by their own (now missing) daughter. Their college-aged son (a kid who appears to have taken acting lessons from sugar packets) now lives there, morose and grim and brooding. I guess he's supposed to be sexy. Most of the time I just kept marveling at how tiny his mouth was. I bet all he can eat are hotdogs and lollipops.

Anyway, the boy (sorry, I didn't bother to learn any of these characters' names) has a BIG SECRET! Before getting to that (or the dozen or so requisite fake scares), the movie labors through uninspired dialogue, stock scenes of a mom and daughter arguing over curfews and dating rules, as well as labored attempts to get our two leads to show anything resembling any kind of chemistry. What's this? Milk Bowl was in a band? Listen to her sing lyrics that sound like they were written by a greeting card author who just downed a pint of Dramamine! Finally, after a few senseless fight scenes (it seems odd that even a surly teenager could -- without provocation -- bash a car with a baseball bat or burn a house down in front of multiple witnesses without expecting to get into trouble for it), the movie limps into the numbingly long third act, where what little shred of credibility it had gets slashed to pieces.

There is absolutely no suspense to the film. No thrills or real scares. No interesting dialogue or action. No likable or believable characters at all. No satisfying conclusion. Only a little bit of the acting and some of the cinematography keeps it from being a total waste, but that's not a real good reason to watch the film. It'd take less time and be more enjoyable if you just got a few R.L. Stine books and read them with a flashlight in your basement.",1359676800,,2981,4.454212454212454
4735017,1,B005LAIHCW,"This movie should not have been billed as either a thriller not a horror film. There was no suspense in this shoddily produced, shamefully acted flaming turd whatsoever. If you cannot figure out what will roughly happen at the end within the first half an hour, you might enjoy this drivel. However, if you have the sense not to go down a dark alley with a blood coated stranger with a knife, this might not be for you.",1359676800,2,419,4.384615384615385
4735128,3,B005LAIHCW,"Elissa becomes enamored with the neighbor next door despite his family's bloody history, but Ryan has several secrets of his own that he plans to keep hidden in the HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET. Mark Tonderai's new thriller loses itself in tired old cliches that have long since lost their appeal. The film is terribly miscast, forcing Elisabeth Shue and Jennifer Lawrence into an awkward mother/daughter relationship that feels very unnatural on screen. Max Thieriot's mousy performance is rather unconvincing as well, and lacks the impact needed in order to leave a lasting impression. The supposed twists offer few surprises, especially for audiences that have already seen the same story played out in a hundred different ways. This drains the film of any suspense, while the lapses in logic and poor decision making by the characters are sure to infuriate viewers. It would be better to just lock HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET away in the cellar with the countless other PSYCHO-spawns than to have anyone else suffer through another uninspired copy.

Really, do we need to see yet amnother portrayl of a the incompetent small town cop?
Do we need Elizabeth Shue, an actress whom I have always liked , playing a woman who doesn't seem to have one likable quality? I could accept that if she were playing avilian, but I think she was supposed ot be a sympathetic charater. The charater is very one dimensional.

Are the two main teenage charactersreally supposed to be in love? Because they had no chemistry. As good as they were individually, they could seem to find a real connection in the contrived situations their characters were in.

Were we meant to figure out the big plot twist within the fiorst 40 minute sof the movies? I watched unti,tne end beacuse I thought there must be something more than the twist I had already figure dout.

Basically this movie is about whether a young teenage woman can build a relationship with a young teenage man... period.  Not until at the end, FINALLY, does something happen that in any way could classify as ""creepy"".  So for about an hour this is nothing more than a teenage angst romantic drama.

So what's she doing in HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET?  Showing her diversity?  Getting a paycheck?
Elevating a routine thriller to loftier heights?  All of the above.
Despite its critical bashing, I enjoyed the film.  Lawrence is excellent as Elissa, a gifted teen who befriends the town pariah, well played by Max Thierot.  Oscar nominee and CSI regular Elisabeth Shue offers a convincing performance as her over-protective mother.  Shue and Lawrence have good chemistry.  While some elements of the plot seem a bit incredulous, the climactic twists and  turns caught me by surprise, and the movie's avoidance of excessive gore is refreshing.

Bad things always happen and that part of the movie was repetitive and a repeat of many previous films.

I still liked it because it was well acted and several actors just stood out. Elissa was played by Jennifer Lawrence and she was stunning. Her role in the movie and the main protagonist was well performed by her. The storyline and plot were generic but it was fun to see an actress of her quality in this film and it kept it interesting. In addition the role of Ryan Jacobson was played by Max Thieriot and I felt he also played the role well.

The psychologically charged film provided plenty of twists and unexpected events. The interesting storyline and and excellent acting performances made this one stand out.

Why would the sheriff go into the house with gun drawn without back-up or at least letting someone else know what he's doing? Why would the mother not see the sheriff's car and know something was majorly wrong before entering the house? What happened to the gun the girl had when she shot the murderer and then went for the keys and he grabed her? Also I guessed who the murderer was in the first 20 minutes--so no surprises there.

It had a great story to it and kept me guessing what was going to happen next. It was not the predictable scary story. Many times through out the movie, it had me jumping in my seat. I liked how the story of this movie was not so easy to figure out as well. It had me confused at a few parts, but at the end of it, it all came together. The suspense kept me interested and I was glued to the screen the entire time. Horror movies are my favorite movies anyways, and this movie lived up to my expectations. Most horror movies are predictable and its nothing that people haven't ever seen before. House at the End of the Street was exciting and surprising. There were several parts where I thought the main character Elissa was seriously about to die, and the movie was about to end. Out of nowhere something would happen and create a whole new scenario. As I stated before, House at the End of the Street left me guessing. The way that the story played out kept it interesting. The fact that the daughter of the parents who had been brutally murdered by her, is found later in the movie deep inside the eerie basement of the family home, was a shock to me. Another shock ended up being that the son Ryan, who was still living in the family home, was keeping his sister there because she was the only family that he had left. Elissa begins to feel sorry for Ryan because people in the town do not like him because of his family history. The biggest shock of all was when Ryan tried to use Elissa as a replacement of his sister, because his sister died a long time ago and ever since then he has just been finding girls to replace his sister. Eventually the girls get away or die, so then he must replace them. Overall this story really kept me interested and it was one of the best scary movies I have seen.

4736118,3,B005LAIHCW,"Producers of ""House at the End of the Street"" couldn't buy better advertising for their low-budget thriller. First, the movie is given a boost by the success of ""The Hunger Games"" and the spotlight it shined on Jennifer Lawrence. Secondly, Lawrence wins a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical a mere five days after the movie's release on Blu-ray and DVD. This further guarantees that more people who weren't familiar with the star now are and will likely give any project she's in a chance.

Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence) and her mother (Elisabeth Shue) move to the suburbs to start a new life. They lease a home in an upper-middle class neighborhood that's affordable to them because of the horrific murders that took place in the house next door. A few years before, a girl killed her mother and father there before running out into the woods and disappearing. She's been long thought dead, but some residents believe she still lives in the woods next to the neighborhood. Elissa befriends the killer's brother, Ryan (Max Thieriot), against her mother's wishes. She soon discovers the boy might be hiding a dark secret from her and the rest of the town.

If ""House at the End of the Street"" is guilty of anything, it's trying to be everything to everyone. It feels as if writers David Loucka and Jonathan Mostow couldn't figure out what genre they wanted to tackle, so they just touched on all of them. While sometimes this can work, it really creates a schizophrenic vibe here. They throw in everything AND the kitchen sink. We get a pinch of slasher films, a handful of ingredients from both thriller and suspense movies, and it gets topped off with the recently overused twist ending everyone's come to expect from these types of movies.

The pacing is erratic under the helm of director Mark Tonderai. However, I'll give credit where credit is due. The camerawork helps to redeem it by capturing a sense of creepy nostalgia thanks to cinematographer Miroslaw Baszak. He chose to use a type of film that makes it look grainy and similar to older classic horror movies.

Jennifer Lawrence puts forth her best effort in the role of flirty and rebellious teen Elissa. Max Thieriot is convincing as the enigmatic Ryan. He's both creepy and charming at the same time, which can be hard to pull off by some actors. Elisabeth Shue does an adequate job portraying the concerned, yet distant mother. Although, she sometimes feels a little disconnected from the role.

The high-definition audio and video transfer for the movie is excellent. The grainy, ""real"" film look isn't tainted by the Blu-ray treatment. The 5.1 surround mix gives viewers plenty of sounds to immerse themselves in. This is very much a movie that relies on loud bumps and noises for its scares and won't let the home audience down in that respect.

There's not much here when it comes to bonus material for the ""House at the End of the Street"" Blu-ray. They include a near-10-minute""making of"" featurette entitled ""Journey Into Terror: Inside 'House at the End of the Street,'"" and a theatrical trailer. It also features the unrated and theatrical version of the movie.

I'm not going to say that ""House at the End of the Street"" doesn't have some enjoyable moments or isn't worth your time. It's just more of the same thing we've come to expect from these types of films. It's like a meal you walk away from full but not satisfied. Nothing you ate was necessarily bad, it just wasn't fantastic. It's one of those PG-13 thriller films we'll see being played repeatedly on the Lifetime Movie Network in a year or so.",1358121600,2,3597,4.7548076923076925

Mostly you think you know where this one is going, but there are enough twists to keep it from being overly predictable.  Jennifer Lawrence is as appealing as always; this actress has mastered the art of making the viewer care about what happens to her in a storyline.  She is beautiful without being unreachable, and does an excellent job in this one.  Elisabeth Shue is very convincing as the flawed mother trying to at last grow up into a mature adult, but not quite managing to do so.  An allegory for our times.  Max Thieriot is very good as the vulnerable but ultimately sinister ""boy next door.""

4736221,5,B005LAIHCW,"Now we are talking about real family secrets with severe consequences!!!

This is a very good movie with an outstanding cast and great direction. And a twist at the very end...

It is a story that could happen in any street, in any neighborhood, in any country. Accidents happen every day. But when you have hippie parents who smoke dope, well that's another story.

Sarah (Elisabeth Shue) and her teen daughter Elyssa (Jennifer Lawrence) arrive in a small town because Sarah just got a new job. She works long hours at the hospital and her daughter has the time and the freedom to do whatever she wants. Sarah is recently divorced and didn't take care of her daughter in the past. Elyssa reminds her of this fact constantly and appears that she misses her father. Now Sarah is overplaying her mother responsibilities which promote a lot of tension between her and Elyssa. They move next to a house where a terrific murder happened few years ago. A girl killed her parents and then disappeared. Most people think that she drowned in the near lake, but they never found her body. Her brother Ryan (Max Thieriot) came back from college to take care of the house. He lives there now quietly. Everybody in town (with few exceptions) thinks that the boy is a weirdo and ...of course a high school adolescent (Elyssa) will fall for him since everybody else is beating on him (...classic).

From the beginning of the movie, the moment they get in their house we have the feeling that something horrible happens in front of us but we are not getting an answer until the very end of the movie. And then, when we think we got the plot straight, the very last scene (...seriously, the last 10 seconds) throws a wrench in everything we thought we knew. And while the titles are rolling we say: Well, I have to watch it again to understand better...Really well done, and Jennifer Lawrence and Elisabeth Shue are superb.

4736337,3,B005LAIHCW,"(Warning: contains some spoilers)  Take a little Psycho, a little Sleepaway Camp, a little Halloween, and you have a lot of this movie.  For those familiar with the horror genre, the first 20 minutes pretty much let you know how the story is going to end.  I will say that the first half of the movie does a good job of creating a creepy, unsettling feeling (thanks to the camera work), but at about the one hour mark, things considerably lose steam...I couldn't believe that there were 40 minutes left.  One of the issues is that in most movies where there's a ""big reveal"" it's saved for the very end.  This movie gradually lets the viewer in on the mystery in a way that kills whatever suspense was established during those very decent first 60 minutes.  I'm purposely being vague because I don't want to give too much away, but the fact is there aren't many directions for the bare bones storyline to take.  Mother and teenage daughter are looking to start a new life...move into a new house...patricide occurred in the house next door...body of murderer never found...brother of murderer/son of murdered still living in the same creepy house in which his parents were killed...teenage daughgter falls for this ostracized, sensitive young man who is keeping a secret from her which the audience is let in on.  This is all laid out in about the first half hour.  There are some twists, but as I said they occur well before the movie ends.  Another problem, in terms of creating an excess of mystery, is that the movie involves very few characters: Jennifer Lawrence as the teenage daughter, Elisabeth Shue as her mother, and Max Thierot as Ryan the troubled boy next door share probably 90% of the total dialogue and camera time.  A good horror movie is hard to find lately and this isn't a bad one; it's just not a very original one.  There's even a friendly, small-town stock police character so brilliantly satirized in Scream.  Maybe all of the good ideas have been taken.  The movie was clearly made for a teenage audience and if you haven't seen many other horror movies, you may feel it holds more suspense than I did. There's no getting around how basic the storyline is, but considering that, the acting is good and particularly during the first half of the film there are some unnerving shots (not really any gore...definitely PG-13).",1357948800,,2347,4.692682926829268

4736399,3,B005LAIHCW,"HATE is a fun thriller aimed primarily at teens.  Plot's pretty standard fare - a teenager girl (Jennifer Lawrence) and her bitchy mom (Elisabeth Shue) move to an upscale neighborhood populated by uptight douches (in the parlance of our times).  We find out in the first 5 minutes that they could only afford the house because the was a gruesome double murder next store - a young girl murdered her parents in cold blood.  The girl escaped without ever being found... and is of course rumored to haunt the nearby woods.

The killer's younger brother (wonderfully played by Max Thieriot), who only survived because he was at his aunt's house at the time of the murders, has moved back into the old house.  Soon, the girl and boy meet and hit it off.  Mom doesn't like the kid, and neither do most of the townies, but he's a sweetheart.  All of this pretty much spelled out in the trailer.  The film, while not terribly stylistic (if you had to take a shot for every ""Dutch angle"" you'd soon be very drunk), is well done enough that we care about what's happening.  The acting is quite good by all (Jennifer Lawrence proves that she's not just a hot chick with a bow and arrow) and the music doesn't club you over the head.

HATE isn't a horror movie so much as it's a thriller and teen melodrama.  It largely succeeds at both goals, and I'm sure younger teen viewers would dig this film a lot.  You see - and again this is in the trailer - the boy is taking care of his deranged sister.  Weird and kinda spooky, but it definitely establishes the boy as a caring guy - you can see why another lonely person would like him.  Great and all, but after about 65-70 minutes, I started looking at my watch as teen melodramas aren't exactly my cup of tea anymore.  Basically, I was starting to hate HATE...

Well it's right about then that HATE kicks it into overdrive, making some balls out moves that immediately take the film in an entirely different direction.  I guessed what was going to happen, but only about 2 minutes before it did happen.  Not too shabby for a flick like this.  I'd say more, but think of this as a sort of horror version of CRYING GAME (and in fact, Stephen Rea actually has a cameo in the film) where the plot twists really are half the movie.  So while it's not great - there are some mighty big continuity errors and gaps of logic - the film tries to cover it's bases, and a well acted original story is always welcome.  Don't run out to see it, but see it before someone ruins the end for you.  Critics have hated this film, but on this one, believe the 80% plus audience approval rate.  It's a good flick.

4736400,2,B005LAIHCW,"[The review refers to the theatrical version of the film.]

One good thing about ""House at the End of the Street"" is that the thriller stars Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar-nominated for her turn in a 2010 indie drama ""Winter's Bone."" But probably she is better known as Raven / Mystique in the new ""X-Men"" franchise and, of course, Katniss Everdeen in ""The Hunger Games."" I don't know what made her choose ""House,"" but even the gifted players like Jennifer Lawrence and Elizabeth Shue cannot save the movie from becoming tedious and predictable.

Elizabeth Shue and Jennifer Lawrence are Sarah and Elissa, mother and daughter who moved into a small town in Pennsylvania. Sarah and Elissa knew before renting their new spacious house that there was a terrible double murder in a small house in the nearby woods. What they didn't know is that Ryan (Max Thrieriot), who happened to be away from home when the murder took place, is still living there. Elissa is attracted to Ryan, who is a bit strange but seems to be a nice person.

But what is more disturbing is the town's ""urban legend"": the killer, who is supposed to be dead, may be still alive, lurking somewhere in the wood. And Elissa comes to think that the rumor may be true. Gil Bellows also appears as a local police officer.

The film's premise sounds great, like an old-fashioned Hitchcock-like thriller, but the execution is simply not. In short, the suspense-less film is just dull, not knowing how to tell its potentially interesting story - the original story by Jonathan Mostow (""Breakdown"" ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines""), screenplay by David Loucka (""Dream House"") - which is ruined by uninspired direction and countless impossible decisions these characters continue to make.

Considering the talent involved, ""House at the End of the Street"" could have been a more entertaining thriller, had it been made by someone with storytelling skills. As it is, the film is only a bland thriller with a few good ideas and gifted actors sadly wasted.",1353801600,9,2009,4.879765395894428
4736401,4,B005LAIHCW,"It seems like only yesterday that Jennifer Lawrence made her big screen debut in Winters Bone, a small scale but critically acclaimed movie which gained her an Oscar nomination.

Since then she has gone from strength to strength starring in two of the biggest box office successes we have seen in the last two years X Men First Class and Hunger Games. I think it's fair to say that her rise has been meteoric.

As I watched the movie and the camera's love affair with her, the thought went through my mind several times of what an exquisite looking creature she truly is, still young enough to play a teenager.

A grisly murder of two parents takes place in a remote house in a leafy suburb of an upscale neighborhood of a typical rural town. The daughter who killed them was never found thus stoking local legend that she is still running around loose.

Years later a mother played by Elisabeth Shue and her daughter Elissa (Jennifer) move to said town they end up in a house nearby from which the slightly rundown, seemingly abandoned and spooky murder house is visible. Cue the scary music when Jennifer looks through the trees and sees the house light unexpectedly come on. Wooh.

As Elissa adjusts to school life her curiosity ensures familiarity with the story, and then one night walking in the rain a car stops to offer her a ride home, and the driver is the current occupant of the scary house the only surviving member of the family. Does she get in the car or keep walking?

Elissa and her mother have one of those fractious relationships and her mother forbids her from having anything to do with the occupant of the house but Elissa is attracted to him and teens will be teens. While she likes this misunderstood boy the town as a whole is understandably suspicious of a boy who would choose to live in the house where his parents were killed. Creepy, right?

Not all the horror of the past has been resolved and although Elissa is on the alert things can happen so you can become scared or horrified. What I liked was that this movie did manage to surprise me. This movie may scare you at times and I liked its unusual twists particularly about the daughter.

I found the movie entertaining and definitely elevated by the star power of Jennifer Lawrence. I think most people will love it and I hope this was helpful",1352592000,81,2329,4.5285714285714285
4736402,3,B005LAIHCW,"Ten minutes into the film, you have the thing figured out. Sarah (Elisabeth Shue) and her daughter Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence) move into a nice home which they got a good deal on because the neighboring house had a double homicide. The daughter killed both her parents. They never found the daughter, but the son who was away at the time now lives in the home. At this point I lead a collective groan in the movie theater.

Perennial teen Jennifer Lawrence, who apparently got hungry in between ""Hunger Games"" consented to play the ever helpful high school teen rock band singer. Mom works at a hospital and is over protective of Jennifer's movie virginity. This was a fair ""B"" movie mystery thriller.

The script was good, but wasn't that great. Having someone the caliber of Jennifer Lawrence star in it, didn't add anything to the feature other than a box office attraction. Her fans will surely overrate this film. Let's not kid ourselves it is 3 1/2 stars even with Miss Lawrence. Predictable with a good head fake.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some immature teen swearing.",1350086400,3,1093,4.772486772486772
4736403,4,B005LAIHCW,"I saw the screening for the film in early February. The studio told the fans to not discuss the movie (obviously so people wouldn't reveal the spoilers, and in case of any bad publicity).

Well either way, I found the movie to be very good. Almost reminded me of the exploitation flicks from the 70s and 80s starting with the title ""House on the end of the street"". The movie comes complete with a great twist that as well  reminded me of a specific flick from the 80s (Sleep**** **** see if you can figure it out).

Plot: Setup is pretty simple. Mother and daughter Elissa and Sarah (Elizabeth Shue, Jennifer Lawrence) move to a new place. Daughter develops feelings for the boy next door Ryan (Max Thieriot). The boy allegedly has a crazy sitter that might of murdered her parents. Elissa gets together with Ryan unaware of the danger she faces, and unaware that both Ryan and Carrie Ann

The acting was very good. Obviously a good cast here: Elizabeth Shue, Jennifer Lawrence, Gil Bellows, Max Thieriot.

The movie gets you thinking that things will turn out one away, but ends up ending another way. I thought the twist they came up was very good, and it was set up very well that no one saw it coming. So many movies claim that in their trailer, but this is one actual flock with an ending that most people didn't see coming.

The soundtrack was good too. Pretty much it establish the dark atmosphere and that things will take a turn for the worse in many scenes.

I got the benefit of an early screening, but I would definitely recommend it along with the along users who have seen it.",1348876800,5,1591,4.4655172413793105
