3790765,2,B001TIQUJW,"She could probably make a lot of money if she'd start a band that was more like the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and maybe a bit edgier. But her crazy, Satanic-feel metal stuff just has too small of an audience. I mean, she has the chops!",1371081600,2,235,4.363636363636363
3790766,5,B001TIQUJW,"If you're looking for classical music, you may be disappointed.  I wasn't. The Great Kat plays what I like to think of as classically inspired melodic grindcore. If that sounds good to you, you may  like this blast of 7 songs in 7 minutes which could possibly change the way you see music without wasting much of your time.",1367452800,3,323,4.4576271186440675
3790767,1,B001TIQUJW,"Unattractive, plays horribly, videos are jumpy and nonsensical. Beethoven piece was nothing at all like he intended it. It was merely a battle of her trying to play over his song. It does not matter how fast you can move your hand if it just sounds like nonsense. I recommend that it be taken off Amazon.",1367193600,8,304,4.446428571428571
3790768,5,B001TIQUJW,"Beethoven's Guitar Shred is a must-have for all serious guitar shredders, metal and classical lovers. The Great Kat breaks the shred guitar speed barrier. Check out ""The Flight Of The Bumble-Bee"" - a hot female guitarist in fishnet stockings shredding at 300 BPM!  Classical Beethoven meets wild shred guitar!",1270857600,,309,5.3061224489795915
3790769,1,B001TIQUJW,"If you want to see the Great Kat shred, don't buy this video.  The videos of her playing are to prerecorded tracks and mostly do not match what she is playing.  Also, if you are looking for any instructional information it is not here.",1269820800,2,235,4.318181818181818
3790770,4,B001TIQUJW,"I like my guitars fast and loud. I'm a big fan of Dave Wronski of Slacktone and Gabriela Quintero of Rodrigo y Gabriela. So, I really enjoyed The Great Kat's new DVD- Beethoven's Guitar Shred. The new release features a loud and fast mix of heavy metal and classical played by the leather halter and black fishnet stocking-clad Great Kat with blazing riffs on Rimsky-Korsakov's ""The Flight of the Bumble Bee,"" Beethoven's ""5th Symphony,"" Paginini's ""Caprice #24,"" Bach's ""Brandenburg Concerto #3"" and Rossini's ""William Tell Overture."" But be prepared for some bizarre bloody images on the videos for ""Torture Techniques,"" ""Blood"" and ""Islamofascists.""",1240099200,,652,5.339805825242719
3790771,5,B001TIQUJW,"Wow!  Beethoven's Guitar Shred is the most over-the-top TECHNICAL guitar shredding I have ever heard!! My favorite video is Flight of the Bumble-Bee and Beethoven's 5th, with its really powerful and amazing guitar playing.  I have never heard anyone play at these speeds and she's a hot leather-clad dominatrix babe, too!  You really have to see this to believe it.  The sick thrash metal videos of Torture Techniques and Blood with screams, spikes, studs and cleavage are like a scene from a thriller movie!  I also loved the Bumble-bee cartoon.  Very entertaining DVD.  This is definitely an instant classic.  I'm going to show this DVD to all my friends that are into classical or metal.  Bow and Obey The Great Kat!",1235779200,,719,4.87603305785124

3790774,1,B001TIQUJW,Blasphemous. The only good sounding noise during this vid was the clicking of my off button.,1410566400,,92,4.8125
3790775,5,B001TIQUJW,"This is an amazing work of art. The Great Kat makes music for intelligent people. Mongoloids may not understand this music, but those evolved surely will.",1409011200,,154,4.961538461538462
3790776,1,B001TIQUJW,"Unbelievably disturbing. This woman is truly scary, regardless of how fast she can move her fingers on the guitar. Bought her cd twenty years ago and was fascinated by the premise of her musical concept, but this video made me feel ill. Watched two minutes and shut it down. If that's an endorsement for you, then good luck.",1404691200,,324,4.603448275862069
3790777,1,B001TIQUJW,This is like watching a dog have an abortion and then being force fed the splooge that comes out,1404432000,4,96,4.105263157894737
3790778,1,B001TIQUJW,"I stopped the video after 20 seconds.  Someone, somewhere, owes me 20 seconds of my life back. This is garbage.  Complete...utter...garbage.",1398297600,,140,5.619047619047619
3790779,1,B001TIQUJW,"This is the kind of content that makes you wonder why you're paying for this service. I don't even understand what the purpose of this video is - it's not about guitars, guitar playing, nobody actually plays the guitar despite the title or description (it's seemingly meant to be a joke), and ""Kat"" is barely discernible (whoever she is). If I had to guess, I would say this is probably some kind of bizarre fetish video, which again makes me wonder why I'm paying for this. In short, this video is awful, irrelevant, deceptive, and inappropriate for younger viewers, not because it's obscene - because it's confusing and not what it says it is. Wait, oh yeah, that's why it's inappropriate for all viewers.",1396137600,,707,4.709677419354839
3790780,1,B001TIQUJW,"I'm glad I got this for no extra charge with my Amazon Prime membership.
 out
This video was worth what I paid for it ... nothing.

If you like crazy guitar playing, however, you might actually enjoy this.

But I didn't bother to finish the video. It wasn't worth the extra MINUTES out of my life.",1393372800,,297,4.267857142857143
3790781,3,B001TIQUJW,The last great wild child.  They really need to do a where are they now. Enjoy the blistering speed! Rock on!,1392422400,,109,4.190476190476191
3790782,1,B001TIQUJW,This is exspicit adult entertaiment There is no warning on this and there should be! NR is not enuff this looks like it is going to be dumb music from the title maybe intresting. Well its Not It IS Xrated stuff. PLEASE don't watch this if you are not looking for somthing like that. Amazon you need to put a warning on this!! I was shocked and got it off the tv rather fast.,1391126400,2,374,4.0675675675675675
3790783,5,B001TIQUJW,"And the videos are awesome, too! I love to watch these Great Kat videos, they are very entertaining and she's a great player!",1388707200,,125,4.478260869565218
3790784,1,B001TIQUJW,"This video was unwatchable.  The artist has talent and ability, but doesn't really use it here.  It seems to only be about raunchy and wild visuals with crazy, uncontrolled guitar playing (very sloppy, without any emotion/feeling).",1387324800,,231,5.388888888888889
3790785,1,B001TIQUJW,"Kat is a VERY good guitarist.  She is classically trained and can play technical pieces with ease.  If you ever get a chance to listen to her playing Flight of The Bumblebee (the album version, not this piece of trash) do so.
This video, however, is an embarrassment. I don't know what this video is supposed to prove or what, but everything in this sucks.  The playing is sloppy and the videos on here are just plain stupid.  Not worth the trouble to click and load the video for playback.
Move along to something better..which is pretty much anything else.",1385856000,6,558,4.55
3790786,1,B001TIQUJW,"I love anything with a guitar. Until I saw this.
 Wow this is terrible. It's a shame to see someone waste their time making this.",1383264000,2,129,4.16
3790787,1,B001TIQUJW,"Let's see. Twenty words about the product.  Well, that's hard to do because there is not much to say about this except that it is disappointing, meaning that I was disappointed when I watched this piece of trash. Why?  Because it did not live up to it's title.  There were hints of a couple of classical tunes, but that is about it.  Based on this video, the performer's musical talents are far to limited to play anything classical in any sort of complete form.",1379980800,,462,4.464285714285714
3790788,1,B001TIQUJW,Awful. Bloody. Ridiculous. Moments I'll never get back. Images I'll never unsee. Who knew someone could  shred so poorly. Eastern European most likely.,1378944000,,151,5.565217391304348
3790789,2,B001TIQUJW,I just found it personally distasteful. There are very graphic scenes which took away from the music in my opinion.,1376265600,,115,4.8
3790790,5,B001TIQUJW,"Don't let disgruntled viewers ruin this one for you. If you're into classical and metal, you'll absolutely love this. Amazing technical playing here. Beethoven's 5th symphony is just brutal.",1376179200,,190,5.586206896551724
3790791,1,B001TIQUJW,"I don't know who this female guitar shredder is, but her skills are lost in a bloody, gothic pastiche that is almost comical.",1372896000,10,125,4.478260869565218
8341590,1,B001TIQUJW,Haha...Rediculous.,1462924800,2,18,18.0
8341591,2,B001TIQUJW,"Fake. Just video posturing. Kat can ACTUALLY play, but you'll get none of that here.",1456531200,,84,4.666666666666667
8341592,1,B001TIQUJW,Crap.,1454544000,,5,5.0
8341593,5,B001TIQUJW,"True to the Title.  Great Kat shreds.  Extremely over the top just like shred guitar should be.  This video is ridiculous, offensive, wonderful, and everything I was looking for.  This my not be for everyone but, if this doesn't make you happy then we probably wouldn't get along.",1445472000,,280,4.770833333333333
8341594,1,B001TIQUJW,Strangest crap I've ever seen. Not funny. Very weird. Lots of blood and strange costumes. The guitar playing is just a bunch of sloppy noise.,1443484800,2,141,4.68
8341595,5,B001TIQUJW,Pure Metal Cheese in all of it's magnificent glory. There aren't enough ways for me to love this video. Disturbing mess...? Absolutely! Entertaining...? Infinitely. \m/ :) \m/,1441497600,,175,5.518518518518518
8341596,1,B001TIQUJW,Not so great Kat. Boring. Remind me of a friend of mine.,1431993600,,56,3.75
8341597,1,B001TIQUJW,I went to therapy after watching this and now my therapist won't return my phone calls. :(,1430697600,,90,4.352941176470588
8341598,1,B001TIQUJW,Just no emotion. Shaking a note is not emotion. Nor is dive bombing. I just didn't feel it.,1428624000,2,91,4.111111111111111
8341599,1,B001TIQUJW,It was the most stupidest video I have ever wasted my time on. 9 minutes long. I watched 2.5 minutes of it and knew right away... what the hell is this??? And what does the devil have to do with classical music?  Go suck some where else!!!,1425772800,,239,4.085106382978723
