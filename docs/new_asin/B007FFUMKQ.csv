5080978,5,B007FFUMKQ,"To have all four movies on Blu Ray is great, but I'm a sucker for collection packaging. Seems they just wrapped the standalone cases in a thin holder to match the release date of Awakening. A little more appreciation of the product would have been nice, but I guess I'm buying the movies, nonetheless.",1337558400,32,301,4.592592592592593
5080979,5,B007FFUMKQ,"This set came very quick along with my other two purchase from amazon. I was actually expecting this to come late but am glad it did arrive soon. They all came in individual packaging from all four movies with ultraviolet copy for the set online. This was a good price since i only purchase the first movie Underworld in dvd when it first came out. its a good movie and i have seen all in the movies except the last one. Am glad the set came out soon, but it look like there is another movie i hope we don't have to wait very long since Kate is not getting younger. And they keep adding new character in the movies. Finally worth spending $40.00 for four movies. Not a bad deal its more if you buy it in best buy i did but return it when i saw its a lot cheaper in amazon you just have to wait..",1337126400,,795,4.0062893081761

5081002,1,B007FFUMKQ,"I bought these for Prime Day (2017) and just got around to using them only to find out none of the discs read, weve tried an Xbox one, blu ray player and PlayStation 4 and 3. Not only do they not read but only one of them had a digital code... which expired in 2014. Luckily that still worked so we have one of the movies. This box set looked nice but ended up being a waste of $30. DO NOT BUY!",1514332800,3,394,3.817073170731707

5081005,4,B007FFUMKQ,"The Underworld films are amazing gothic horror action films that focus on a centuries-long war between vampires and lycans (werewolves). This boxed set includes the first four films in the franchise, of which my favorites are the first Underworld and the prequel Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. The box has some great cover art that shines brilliantly in the light due to the reflective faux metallic accents. My only qualm is that only the fourth Blu-Ray had an Ultraviolet code for digital activation.",1512777600,4,503,5.072289156626506

5081009,2,B007FFUMKQ,"This purchase was,... NOT worth the price.  The collection of videos themselves was the only thing included in this ""collection"" despite the product listing ""Digital Copy Expiration Date: December 31, 2017"".  On TOP of that, there's three different dates, AND the digital code is only good for Underworld Awakening, not the collection itself.

The date on the item page - Digital Copy Expiration Date: December 31, 2017
The date on the plastic covering - December 21 2016
The date on the insert with the code - May 8th, 2014.

What the hell is going on with this item, it's completely random.  At this point in time I'm beginning to wonder if the item itself is a cheap copy and not the original item.

Given the choice again, I would never buy this product, and honestly it's sullied my thoughts on purchasing anything like this again on Amazon.",1506297600,9,846,4.72108843537415

When I got this set I spent a couple days watching all the special features.  Then I went through and watched the movies starting with the 3rd movie Rise of the Lycans, because it is a prequel.  It shows how the Lycon-vampire war started.  The I watched Underworld, Evolution, Awakening and then Blood Wars.  Blood Wars is not a part of this 4 movie set.

I'm sure they'd replace it no problem but I'm not sure if I care enough to deal with the hassle. I haven't watched the movies yet so if there's an issue there then I'll return them but otherwise, it's just the case.

Update: I added a star, the disc in the broken case worked perfectly fine. Still not 5 stars because it's possible it was sent broken and this is a review of the physical collection and not the movies themselves.",1468540800,,580,4.2727272727272725

-1 stars for this boxed set as advertised

I love these movies. Have had this in my wish list for awhile, just waiting for the price to drop a little. The price did drop to just under $20 on Prime Day so I pulled the trigger. Apparently, despite the description stating ""Digital Copy Expiration Date: December 31, 2017"" and all of the reviews claiming Ultra Violet/digital copies of the films are included.. there are, in actuality, NO such codes. At least, not in the box that I received. Needless to say, I am returning this set. Not because I want to, as I do love these films. I simply do not like paying for something and not getting everything that I was led to believe I would be receiving. For me, this is about principle.. I don't appreciate being misled.

When the product arrived Yes it had redemption codes for Ultraviolet.  Unfortunately they had all expired.  Upon contacting amazon they informed me that there was no digital copy sold with this product.  So lesson learned... when purchasing from amazon, just because everyone else buying the same product has received a digital copy and you receive expired codes... you didn't really purchase them.  I am returning these discs after a long chat with customer support where they 'explained' all this to me and my only recourse is to return the discs for a refund or keep them and not get what I paid for and was expecting.",1400716800,,785,4.735294117647059

As far the packaging on this 'set', its just thin cardboard, kind of flimsy.  I had hoped it would be a little more substantial but in the end I don't really care that much its just to hold each movie as a set for storage.  The individual movies are normal blu-ray packaging so thats no problem.",1400630400,7,440,4.27710843373494

5081503,1,B007FFUMKQ,"When I was looking on Amazon.com for this product, I was excited to actually find it and I bought it.  When I received the package in the mail, I immediately opened it up to find myself extremely disappointed. Nowhere on the order form or screen told me it was going to be the Spanish form.  The actual collection was the Spanish edition and I don't speak any of that language.  I was then in an email  conversation over a few days in trying to get that exchanged to the English edition(or even refunded).  The person on the other end of the email kept telling me to go in through the settings and change the language.  I'm not interested in doing that when I didn't know if it was going to be dubbed over or even have the captions at the bottom of the screen.  After a few emails back and forth, that person told me I could just return it but I was uncertain about sending it back to Spain, let alone getting my refund back. So I feel like I'm stuck with it and wasted my money.  It also makes me feel uncomfortable about ordering through Amazon again(and I probably won't) because I seriously don't want to go through that again.
  I would reconsider my option if there is a way that I could get this exchanged to the English version without sending it back to Spain and going through a chain of emails to do so.",1397865600,,1314,4.262096774193548

5081570,3,B007FFUMKQ,"Underworld fans get a 4-disc Blu-ray Legacy Collection with four films: Underworld, Evolution, Rise of the Lycans and Awakening. This release adds Awakening to the Blu-ray collection but it remains the weakest of the films (the 3D version is not included but sold separately). UltraViolet Digital Copy codes are provided for the films. Overall, the picture quality is good but varies by film (the first three films could use a good remastering). However, the audio is great. There is over 5.5 hours of bonus content which is somewhat light for 4 films. Additional extras for Evolution and Rise of the Lycans would make this release a little more deluxe since the original Underworld gets the lion's share of the bonus content. Underworld fans who own the Trilogy Blu-ray collection may consider purchasing Awakening 3D on Blu-ray separately instead of upgrading to this set since it contains the same extras. The Underworld Legacy Collection is somewhat disappointing since it simply bundles the stand-alone Blu-ray releases together. These are 4 star films in a 3 star package.

So i typed in the 2nd code and the same thing...it only redeemed 1 movie ( lucky it was a different movie of the 4 that came in the set) so now im stuck with 2 of 4 of the movies on UV and have no clue why the others are not presenting them selves yet, or why there isn't 2 more codes inside this set.. Im pretty bummed about all of this because that's 2 UV movies that will cost money now for something i already purchased and my collection is incomplete for my Christmas traveling..  :(",1355961600,4,857,4.041176470588235

5081686,5,B007FFUMKQ,"So, anyone who's read my reviews on prior ""complete series"" releases (I doubt anyone has, but just in case) knows I despise the releases for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-The-High-Definition-Trilogy-Blu/dp/B000UR9T82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man: The High Definition Trilogy (Blu)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-Trilogy-Blu/dp/B0060FXBNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers Trilogy (Blu)</a>, as both are completely half-assed offerings by studios rushing things to market, or worse: intentionally double-dipping consumers.

This set on the other hand is NEARLY flawless. And the flaws I can forgive.

I'll start with the flaws:

1) It's a repack of existing full-features releases, individually wrapped in a[n attractive] cardboard ""brick"" sleeve. This I don't have a problem with. I'm not one of those ""remaster the discs"" / ""repacks the discs in different cases"" fanatics. Individual cases are fine with me as long as the CONTENT is king. On this release, *it is*. You get all 4 movies with all the full-features included on the original fully featured disc releases. Awesome. No double-dipping. Buy it once. You're done. More on that in a sec'.

2) UV digital copy. I like the concept of UV, but implementation is occasionally lacking. In this case, redemption was easy, but quirky. At least in my copy... The 4 cases were sealed and there was a UV redemption code in the cardboard brick outside the individual disc wrappers. Easy enough. Redeemed. But wait. Where's Rise of the Lycans? Not showing up in my Sony Store or UVVU account. Really? Did they skip one movie out of the franchise? So, I opened Rise of the Lycans to get that redemption code, assuming there must have been one included on that original release, thus the second redemption code outside the wrappers wouldn't include it? No such luck... No redemption code in the Rise of the Lycans case. However, in the Awakening set there WAS a second redemption code. Which I redeemed... For a second UV copy of Awakening. However, at that point, Rise of the Lycans ALSO appeared in my Sony Store & UVVU accounts in addition to he extra Awakening license. So, I'm not sure whether Lycans just took a while for the Sony Store to 'see' it and transmit it to UVVU account and the timing was just coincident with the second redemption code, or whether the second code really was for BOTH Awakening AND Lycans, thsu duplicating Awakening but at least rounding out the UV collection with the 4th title, after a brief scare and some colorful language. All told, yes, all 4 movies do appear to be included. But, as always, digital copy codes appear to be time-limited, which I find distasteful, as I've purchased several titles in 'new' / 'sealed' condition, went to enter the codes (either for iTunes DC or UV) and gotten an 'invalid code' message, despite the verbiage on the slip saying ""code MAY NOT be valid after xx/yy/zzzz"" (not ""definitely WON'T BE VALID after...""). Haven't yet tried streaming the videos beyond a minute or two to test they do in fact stream. But may eventually as I start using VUDU on my Blu-Ray player / hi def TV. And, again, this mean there's still no double or triple dipping (except maybe if you want 3D down the road; I'm not sold on it yet, so it doesn't factor in for me). Basically, you get the Blu version AND the online UV digital copy for the same overall ""price."" That is, you don't have to buy them separately, making this an overall good value (if you can get it for the right price). My opinion is ~$10/title or less is about 'fair,' less being better, as many of us have already paid into the system by buying prior DVD, DVD SE or barebones Blu versions.

3) No DVD copies. I know, I know... 'Blu-Ray is teh r0xx0r,' or whatever the kids are saying these days. I agree, Blu-Ray is pretty neat (the video quality is great vs. upconverting standard definition DVDs to hi def). However, not everyone has adopted yet. Plenty of friends / family haven't yet seen the value proposition of upgrading their still-functioning DVD/TV hardware to hi def. I think combo packs would help ease this transition. If a combo pack were available at ~the same price, I'd probably buy that instead, if only for backward / forward compatibility. As I often bring movies over to friends' / family's houses for evening entertainment. If they don't have blu, that means if I upgrade to Blu I may have to ""keep"" my old DVD copies around rather than trading them or selling them and recouping some of the double dipping. It would be great if studios would include DVD copies for backward compatibility. In some ways even just a bare copy would be fine, as long as it's functional. But if it doesn't cost any more, the SE disc(s) would be preferred so friends could see the special features too. I mean if one's going for an 'ultimate set,' why not go 'all in' rather than just half way? My opinion is that it would also easy late adopters into the shift by not-double-dipping and in the process building a hi def library that will be in place the day they *do* decide to switch viewing paradigms. IT might even encourage the switch by offering a carrot: ""well, you've got the hi def flicks already, why not try them out?"" Again, I can live with the hi def version & temporarily keeping my older versions. I just kind of wish there was a ""best of both worlds approach.""

So, overall, my rating on this one is ""buy at the right price."" ;) It's a great value proposition on account of the UV digital copy (if you're into that sort of thing) and for the fact you get all 4 movies WITH all the special features. Sure, it's a repack... But it's a well-done re-pack, not a hack job like Spiderman Trilogy or Transformers Trilogy, listed above.

It would have been nice if there was a SINGLE UV redemption code in the package (like the Resident Evil collection UV code which was a single code good for all 4 movies and worked flawlessly) instead of two redemption codes that haphazardly covered the series and resulted in an extraneous 'copy' of Awakening in my UV account. On that note, it would be kind of neat if when adding a title you already have, it instead gave you a credit toward a different title from the same studio, or generally. There's no point in having multiple copies of the same title via UV. It's just redundant. I'd much rather be able to get an additional title. But UV is new, so nobody's thought much about the finer details yet. Studios always seem to be the LAST to adopt innovations. Go figure.

But, quirks aside, I like this set. More than several other... That's all for now!",1352332800,28,6711,4.86013986013986

I don't care if they didn't all come in super cool cases and that each had their own. They are great films and the packaging is just packaging. However I didn't really like that the first movie wasn't brought over to Blu-ray very well.

I know that it was  free shipping but I thought that referred to the shipping method and not to the fact that they would ""drag"" their feet for just sticking the box in the mail!!!

5081717,5,B007FFUMKQ,"I had not seen any of the Underworld movies previously so I decided to purchase The Legacy Collection.  I definitely enjoyed all four movies and would like to see more of this series in the future.  I like that they have real vampires and didn't try to do any nonsense like Twilight (vampires shouldn't sparkle or go out in daylight).  I didn't really like the werewolves animation but that is a minor issue.  Overall, worth the purchase if you don't have any of the movies, either you love or hate ultraviolet digital copy so I won't go into that as that has been commented on since UV rolled out.",1340236800,,598,4.458715596330276

5081719,5,B007FFUMKQ,"Cool to get this four disc set with all four of the Underworld movies. Very disappointed Sony just repackaged the old blu rays and added the fourth one to make a set. They know that this franchise sells, so why not at least remaster the first two with the newer technologies of today. The first one was made awhile ago when blu ray technology was new. If any of the movies deserve a ""remastering"" it would be the first Underworld. A new hi def video transfer along with new soundtrack utilizing DTS-HD. And why use the same covers with each film housed in a blue plastic case (like typical blu ray) and not red ones or even a fold out type so the set would be thinner. These studios need to start making these ""collections"" collectible for the fans. But, they know how to save money AND make money. The last I checked this set is selling mighty well. Especially when you can get the whole set a few dollars more than Awakening alone.
All in all, this is a good set to show off to your friends and let them know that blu ray is the best way to watch (and listen) to these dark movies. In this case, the blu rays blow away the DVDs of these movies.
So crank up the surround sound and turn up those subwoofers. It's a hell of a ride!!",1339804800,60,1231,4.198312236286919
5081720,4,B007FFUMKQ,I have enjoyed all the movies and found this collection at a great price so of course I ordered it. I have seen them all before and others have given the stories. I want to say that the only gripe I have is the blu ray transfer of Rise of the Lycans. I found it grainy in parts. Awakening looks wonderful and is a solid entry in my opinion to the franchise. The whole set is worth the price of about $40 that is just $10 a film what a bargain for hours of enjoyment.,1339545600,,466,3.9157894736842107

5081723,5,B007FFUMKQ,"What can I say?? I'm a huge Kate Bekinsale fan and this set doesn't disappoint!!  Well worth the money!!  Even though the third installment doesn't have Kate in it, it is still good.",1339286400,,182,4.484848484848484
5081724,5,B007FFUMKQ,"The Underworld Legacy Collection is a series of movies about a war between vampires and lycans (werewolves).

In Underworld, the primary character, Selene, has been a warrior class of vampire for 600 years.  During a mission, she encounters a human doctor, Michael Corvin being followed by Lycans for reasons unknown. During the firefight, she rescues him from them. but he has been bitten already.  Intrigues follow and she and Michael uncover a secret history of the 1000-year war.  One that directly affects her past and changes her future.  The first movie is both action and romance movie with the Selene/Michael situation as well as the discovery of tragic love of Lucian/Sonja ala Romeo & Juliet.  He, a lycan slave and she, a vampire elder's daughter.  The Underworld moves at a fast pace and doesn't get too far, romantically, because of the speed of the movie.

Underworld Evolution continues immediately from the first as Selene and the hybrid, Michael, continue their efforts to survive by reaching the only surviving elder, Marcus, only to discover he is a hybrid as well, and one with an agenda all his own.  Between running and fighting, Selene and Michael discover not only their love for each other, but an ancestor they weren't aware existed...the first true immortal (neither vampire or lycan), Alexander Corvinus, Michael's direct ancestor from the mortal bloodline.  Mortally wounded by his son, Alexander imparts a bloodgift to Selene to end Marcus's rampaging quest that could have devastating consequences for the entire world.  Michael and Selene resolve the situation and discover a side effect of Alexander's gift...she's a daywalker.  The second movie is faster than the original, but doesn't squander the efforts to tell of the developing relationship between Selene and Michael or the revelations made of Selene's mortal past.

Underworld Rise of the Lycans doesn't really involve Selene or Michael except in flashbacks (or flashforwards if you prefer).  It takes place 1000 years before and tell of the tragic love of Lucian and Sonja.  An interesting story, that while takes an intriguing look into the past, moves too fast and is over in less than 1 hour 20 minutes.  While it has plenty of action, they should have explored more of the relationship between the two doomed lovers.  Still an entertaining viewing.

Underworld Awakening is actually a misnomer.  12 years later, the secret is out. The existence of both species is now public knowledge.  Humanity has united and virtually exterminated both species. Following an ambush of the two lovers, Selene wakes up from cryogenic sleep after 12 years.  She escapes and discovers a world she doesn't recognize.  She meets up with a deathdealer wannabe and finds a little girl that everyone seems to want - badly. She quickly discovers that this is no mere girl.  This (powerful) girl is daughter of Michael and Selene.  Easily as powerful as both parents and she hasn't even grown into her full capabilities yet.  Discovering that certain agencies have been compromised, she finds an ally with a mortal cop.  A cop who has sympathy for Selene as his late wife had become a vampire, and sacrificed herself before the authorities endangered her husband.  Eventually she discovers that Michael is alive and has to choose between rescuing him or their daughter.  Underworld Awakening has Selene dealing with the loss of Michael, the discovery of a child that didn't exist when she was last awake, and trying to deal with emerging emotions she was never prepared to handle.  As well as facing genocide by humans and a new breed of super-lycan.  The movie leaves an opening for the next film (hopefully reuniting the family Corvin).  It would be interesting to see how Eve (the daughter and former labrat) develops in both power and maturity.

Collectively, one of the better movie franchises that has been released.  I find that the nature of the vampires and lycans (viral, not supernatural) to be one of the better explanations of their existence. Underworld Awakening was also filmed in 3D (like Avatar), so that depth perception is nothing short of amazing.  They don't do scenes like knives, exploding throwing stars, etc. just because it was filmed in 3D.  They had scenes like that in all the movies.

Despite the weakness (and shortness) of the third movie, I highly recommend the Underworld Legacy Collection. Kate Beckinsale performs superbly as Selene, and Scott Speedman does well as Michael.  Other notable performances: Bill Nighy (Victor), Tony Curran (Marcus), Michael Sheen (Lucian), Shane Brolly (Kraven), and the debut of India Eisley (Eve).",1339286400,,4639,5.096688741721854

When I pre-ordered this, I have only seen the 1st movie and Rise of the Lycans. I recently just watched the Awakening and Evolution. Awakening (I think that is the 2nd one) is awesome. Evolution (the last one) is kinda stupid in the beginning but it gets better. Great price for the whole set!",1338768000,,413,4.594594594594595

I bought this bc It claimed to include a digital copy. When I buy a boxed set that advertises digital copy included I expect copies of each movie. This has been the case with EVERY boxed set I e purchaset, but this set only includes a digital copy for Underworld Awakening, the other 3 movies do NOT have codes. The code also expired in 2014!
