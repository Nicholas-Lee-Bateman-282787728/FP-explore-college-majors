If you have the slightest interest in reading these product reviews, then you should simply stop and get the DVD. You'll love it. The story has it all - the superstar, the introvert, the enforcer, Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury, Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones, Al Gore, George Bush, student life in the late 60s (Vietnam, student protests, life on campus as an athlete), the camaraderie of athletes working together, and the bravado-free honesty of the former players discussing the anxiety of on-field pressure. Very well done!",1251936000,2,616,5.049019607843137

3850271,5,B00260LFAQ,"Kevin Rafferty has done a masterful job in recreating the last time ever that Harvard and Yale played ""The Game"" to a tie in 1968.  (Overtime now ensures that there will be no more ties.)  The film consists entirely of three elements:  (1) footage from the television broadcast,  (2) interviews with the players, and  (3) minimal graphics to tie the story together.  Just the players - no coaches, no officials, no people in the stands, no commentariat.  Of course, this is being recalled forty years after the fact, and some memories don't entirely jive with those of others or with the television clips.  Watching the hour-plus of outtake interviews gives an even fuller picture, while making one grateful that Rafferty was judicious in his final cut.  Probably best not to watch both the film and the bonus in one sitting.

If you think the only football games worthy of attention are professional and BCS caliber teams, you won't be interested in this movie.  If you have nothing but antipathy (or worse) for the Ivy League, don't bother.  If you are interested in a historical re-creation of an event that profoundly affected 40+ men who were coming of age in a time of considerable outside stress (the military draft at the height of the Vietnam war) and hearing their reactions to something that happened two-thirds of their lives ago, you could do a lot worse.  If you're a Doonesbury fan from way back, you will also find it of interest.

The answer to the question why Calvin Hill was not featured more is that he declined to talk to Rafferty.",1250467200,9,1553,4.724907063197026
3850272,4,B00260LFAQ,"Thanks to my father, a Harvard alumnus, I saw an amazing game. For me, the film brought back a lot of great memories of the day. The documentary's format is a simple one; show the game, an old grainy colored film, with comments from the players. When Tommy Lee Jones appears, it took viewers a few moments to realize who he was and then a few more seconds to realize he played in the game. Along with Jones' comments, filemaker Rafferty, interweaves comments from the players on both sides. This is a sports documentary with well-educated men who say some insighful and funny things. I found it to be like sitting in a sports bar listening to men recall their younger days. Another aspect of the film I thought Rafferty did a wonderful job of was generating suspense as the end of the game approached. Very unusual technique since the outcome is obvious by the title. My four stars is due to one shortcoming in the film. Rafferty tries to convey a lot about the times, the schools, and the players. However, there is one famous player that was not interviewed and very little discussed... Calvin Hill, the Yale running back who went on to play for the Dallas Cowboys. I felt Rafferty could have noted why Hill was not talked about as much as others were. Aside from that shortcoming, you should enjoy the name dropping of several famous people (in their younger days). All in all, if you like football, this will be a very entertaining movie.",1248652800,4,1442,4.571428571428571
3850273,5,B00260LFAQ,"I know very little about football.  My girlfriend knows even less.  Yet we were both captivated and delighted by this film.

Aside from getting caught up in the unfolding action of a football game that is more incredible than any fictionalized game I've seen, we really enjoyed the experience of the 60's that the film evoked through the stories told by the players.  These are the most thoughtful, witty football players imaginable, and they drew us in with their frankness, insights, humor, and the reflectiveness that the 40 years of life-experience since the game have given them.

No matter who speaks in the movie, whether it's the guy who keeps wanting to hurt people to get them out of the game, the ""aloof,"" introspective second string quarterback who can throw the ball 50 yards with either hand, Tommy Lee Jones, who was roommates with Al Gore and is about to hang up his helmet for good and move to Hollywood, or the Jewish player whose father tells him to play on the Sabbath, all the personal stories are beautifully edited together by the filmmaker to make an engrossing tale that's as much about interesting people living through a dramatic time as it is about a football game.

I think this film will continue to be around for a long time to come.",1247875200,18,1264,4.671171171171171
3850274,5,B00260LFAQ,"A documentary about an old sports event that not only keeps you at the edge of your seat, but has you wanting to see it all over again to catch the personal subtleties which Rafferty allows the players themselves, to display.

3850276,5,B00260LFAQ,"I was in high school in 1968 and remember the game and its legend well.  My wife knew nothing of the game.  We both loved the movie.  Rafferty skillfully weaves interviews with players with footage of the game and narration in an insightful and entertaining fashion.  He also has a remarkably wry sense of humor. It's not a comedy but I found the audience erupting into laughter more often than at most mainstream comedies.
I saw it at a movie theater but I think it should be great on DVD at home.",1239667200,19,498,4.380434782608695
3850277,5,B00260LFAQ,"I'm not a huge football fan (especially college football), but I LOVE this movie.  I stumbled upon it on Netflix streaming (where it's no longer available) and watched it about 10 times.  I bought copies for six friends.  When I couldn't find it online anymore, I had to buy one for myself.  Have watched it ANOTHER 10 times.

The story is compelling, but the thing that makes this movie special is the direction.  The movie is comprised primarily of interview footage interspersed with the actual game footage.  The continuity between the two is fantastic.  Also, the continuity BETWEEN the interviews is fantastic.  There are a few times when Yale players would say ""That was a bad call!  I was eight feet away and there was no facemask!""  This is immediately followed by the linebacker saying something like, ""I was trying to take him out of the game and was hellbent for destruction and got what I deserved -- good call.""

This is an amazingly entertaining film, especially once you get past the first half hour.  The last half hour is absolutely spellbinding -- you literally can't stop watching it.

Recommended highly.  This is a very special film, even for people who hate sports films.",1417478400,,1194,4.784313725490196

The background information on the players, the schools, and the time and place (late 1960s New England) brought depth to a story that is a good one to begin with. Knowing the basic rules of the game helps to follow the action, but it is not necessary to enjoy.

3850298,5,B00260LFAQ,"Great stuff.

The game footage is excellent as is the audio, and the interspersed interviews well-placed.  The players recollections make the movie, with J.P. Goldsmith of Yale easily the most enjoyable to hear recall the game.

Ironically, actor Tommy Lee Jones is nearly insufferable in his recall, attempting to imbue his altogether unnoteworthy memories with a rich import made all the more mawkish when framed by the genuine sincerity of Goldsmith, Harvard QB Frank Champi, and many others.  Have the mute button ready when he appears.

Overall, terrific, and what a great moment for all involved to have been a part of, regardless of outcome. - Tom Flynn, Boxer Journal, Author -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Venable-Park/dp/1936400294/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Venable Park</a>",1303084800,,831,6.129310344827586

It may seem at first like a time capsule, of more interest to former college students or football players from the 1969 era, but the tension builds and the game footage gets more and more compelling. It's also an excellent story about team spirit, character, and the emotional reality of the Vietnam era.

The photography is primitive compared to today's sports films, where you can see the intent in the players' eyes, but it's adequate.  The fans--in the Yale stands, waving white hankies, in the Harvard stands, shouts and groans--reflect the teams, and the schools, as do the contemporary interviews with men who played that day. They obviously still think that this was one of the most important days of their lives--no matter which side they were on.

Harvard is basically the liberal school, which wants us out of Viet Nam, while Yale is just the opposite (Yale was not co-ed at that time).

Tommy Lee Jones, who was a guard for Harvard and Al Gore's roommate, is among many who played the game who is extensively interviewed.  There are references to Mike Doomsbury, George W. Bush, and Meryl Streep among others who were students of girlfriends of players.

3850304,5,B00260LFAQ,"First, it was a little weird watching this video a few days ago and then watching the US vs. England World Cup 2010 first round game.  Similar to the Harvard-Yale game that ended 29-29, which was hailed as a win for Harvard despite the tied score, the US-England game was called a win for the US despite the 1-1 tie.  In each game the highly favored team was expected to win by significant odds, and in both cases, the underdog fought back to tie and humble its opponent.

As for the Harvard-Yale video, it is an interesting and at times gripping account of the game.  The director interjects commentary from players from both teams as he moves the story along with video clips from the actual game.  Any game takes place in a larger local and sometimes national context.  This game, which took place in 1968, was interwoven with the cultural and political upheavals of the 1960's, 1968 being one of the most tumultuous.  Players explain not only their roles on the teams and within their respective schools, but also recall the tensions of and interplay between their local communities and the nation at large.  For example, Harvard players included a Vietnam Vet, and ROTC member and a member of Students for a Democrattic Society.  Come game time, the differences among these individuals were set aside for the greater good of the team.

The viewer gets the perspective from both sides: from the Yale team, ranked 16th in the country, expecting it could do no wrong, led by an almost messianic quarterback who had not lost a game since the seventh grade, and from the Harvard team, portrayed as a mix of lesser talented kids from working class families.  The director does an excellent job of going back and forth from the Yale to the Harvard angle, and interspersing the other larger cultural and political factors along the way.  There is an appropriate culmination to the final score, along with memorable reflection of the larger meaning of the game for the individuals involved.

Oddly enough, the only downside for me was Tommy Lee Jones.  I did not know that he played for Harvard.  He was on the team, but unless I missed it, he did not seem to have played in the game itself.  Why he had a significant speaking role is puzzling to me.  He did not offer much to the conversation and came off as trying to appear as a stereotypical Harvard graduate - pensive, articulate, philosophical - but did a poor job of it.

3850307,3,B00260LFAQ,"I too read the glowing reviews of this film, both here and elsewhere. Thankfully I rented, rather than purchased, it. Because, frankly, there just wasn't much there.

I didn't hate it. It was an entertaining tale, though my wife left at about 15 minutes. ""Are they going to do anything else except talk about and show this game?"" ""Apparently not...."" What else might they have done? Well, provide a little context of how this impacted these players' lives. How did this event change them? Other than giving them a bit of immortality that would have been lost if Yale had won. A few talked about how the humbling was good for them, but still it was in the context of the game. These men have gone on to important careers and full lives. Did this game have any role in their later lives?

For instance, Brian Dowling bounced around pro football for several years before washing out. Did this game play a part in that? Might he have been better if they had won as predicted? What did he do for the decade between his departure from football and his career as a broadcaster? Have the Yale players suffered as a result? Why was Mike Bouscaren so eager to accept the blame? Has something happened in his life since then? He describes himself as a dirty, selfish player. Was he proud? Disgusted? Who knows? I just felt that they spent too much time on the game itself, fascinating though it was, and not enough on what effect the contest had.

And something from the Yale coaching staff would have been good. Why didn't they mix things up? Remove Bouscaren? The onside kick?

I watched all the extra interviews as well, and found myself enjoying the time. These men clearly had a great day, and were eager to share it (except Calvin Hill.....where was he?)

3850309,5,B00260LFAQ,"This documentary film about a 1968 football game between rivals Harvard and Yale is great fun and also opens a little window on ""The Sixties"" (which really went from around 1965 to 1974 as one of the players points out). Filmmaker Kevin Rafferty (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Atomic-Cafe-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B001B1Q3FS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Atomic Cafe (Collector's Edition)</a>) tracked down Harvard and Yale players some four decades after the game and skillfully mixes game footage with the player interviews. The result is 73 captivating minutes of sports, social commentary, and even celebrity watching.

How is a tie a win? Both teams were unbeaten going into the final game of the year, but Yale had future Dallas Cowboy star Calvin Hill and a number 16 ranking in the polls (Yale? 16th in the land?!). Yale goes out to a big lead and has the game well in hand until odd things begin to happen. Still down 29-13 with a minute to play, Harvard manages to score two touchdowns plus two two-point conversions in the final 42 seconds to ""win"" the game, 29-29. (Harvard was aided by Yale's astonishing lack of an onside kick return play that helped Harvard regain possession of the ball and begin its final drive.)

Football aside, the film features Tommie Lee Jones (No Country for Old Men), then an all-conference lineman for Harvard and Al Gore's roommate! Yale's QB, Brian Dowling was the inspiration for Doonesbury's B.D. And George W. Bush gets a mention for hanging from the goal posts in a state of inebriation after an earlier Yale win at Princeton. Another player (now bald on top and thick in the middle) was dating a shy and reserved Meryl Streep. The Vietnam War always in the background and sometimes took center stage - at least at Harvard. At least one player was a vet who had survived Khe Sanh while another was a member of the SDS. Casual sex had been discovered with the invention of the Pill - every date offered at least a possibility of 'going all the way'.

What really makes the film, however, is the fact that several of these former players are very good story tellers, whether it is the deft humor and witty insight of J.P. Goldsmith or the scary honesty of linebacker Mike Bouscaren, who candidly admits he attempted to injure the Harvard QB, but only got a well-deserved personal foul. (Oddly, he also asserted with absolute certitude that he had knocked a Harvard running back out of the game by using his helmet as a weapon and spearing the player's ankle. The game film clearly shows Bouscaren is nowhere near the action when that player is injured. Bouscaren had created his own false memory!)  Compelling times, good stories well-told, and a wild game on the gridiron make for a highly entertaining an stimulating film.",1262995200,10,2813,4.991471215351813

3850311,5,B00260LFAQ,"The 1968 Harvard-Yale football game is rightfully considered one of the greatest in the history of college football.  The game that is virtually always rated the greatest game ever occurred the next with Arkansas and Texas, rated #2 and #1 playing the last regular season game of the first one hundred years of college football, with Billy Graham giving the opening prayer and Richard Nixon giving the trophy after the game.  And while that game will long be considered the best, largely because of the unrepeatable circumstances surrounding the game.  But to be perfectly honest, for sheer entertainment, the Yale-Harvard game was better.  What makes this documentary so great is not that it does a fine job of recounting one of the classic games, complete with interviews with most of the key figures in the game (sadly Calvin Hill, the player from the game with the most successful pro career, did not participate in the film), but that it recreates the large social setting of the day.  The ending is one of the most famous in the history of college football, but what gives it so much impact in this film is getting the reaction of the players to the game and learning what their situation away from the field was.  The overall result is one of the most entertaining films that I've seen in quite a while.

One of the things that makes the film so much fun is that the players included some familiar people.  Brian Dowling remains one of the most famous Ivy League players ever while Calvin Hill enjoyed a memorable career with the Dallas Cowboys.  Actor Tommy Lee Jones, who played for Harvard, is one of the interviewees.  And famous people were lingering on the edges.  One player was dating Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones was rooming with Al Gore, and one player had roomed with George W. Bush, who had graduated from Yale the previous spring.

On a pure football note, it is interesting to see that had Yale taken care of the football, they would have won with ease.  Key fumbles led to Harvard scores and prevented Yale ones.  I was delighted watching the replays of famous Yale QB Brian Dowling.  I knew that he was the basis for the character BD in the Doonesbury comic strip, but I had never actually seen any extended footage of him playing.  He was an incredibly exciting player to watch, a Roger Staubauch/Fran Tarkenton type scrambler who was brilliant at finding receivers as he ran around in the backfield.  Going into the game Dowling had the distinction of never having lost a football game.  And despite the title of the film, he never did.",1257984000,2,2562,4.680803571428571

3850313,5,B00260LFAQ,"I was a 1L at the Harvard Law School, and I was there on that brilliant afternoon in November of 1968, having managed to snag a ticket from a friend in the Harvard Marching Band.  What started as a dispiriting rout ended with total strangers screaming and hugging after Harvard's improbable comeback.  Many commentators touted Yale's superior talent as a team, but this was not at all the case.  There was, indeed, one world-class athlete on the field that afternoon, Yale's Calvin Hill, who would have been a standout anywhere, including places such as Southern Cal, Notre Dame, Michigan, Ohio State, the SEC and SWC (if they'd allowed black players back in the day).  But after Hill, the teams were fairly evenly matched.  Are there ghosts and spirits that haunt Soldier Field in Cambridge?  No question about it.  This is a wonderful film, not to be missed.",1256947200,3,860,4.809523809523809
3850314,4,B00260LFAQ,"I remember listening to this game with my late father-in-law.  I had followed that Yale team all season and couldn't believe the startling collapse in the last few minutes.  He was a Harvard fan, though softspoken about it.  He obviously enjoyed my every wince as Harvard charged back from near certain defeat.  The player interviews along with actual game films were nicely spliced together to produce a fine film.",1254700800,,415,4.971014492753623
3850315,5,B00260LFAQ,"It's November 23, 1968 and, for the first time since 1909 Harvard and Yale are meeting in the last game of the season and both teams are undefeated. Yale is ranked 16th in the nation and is heavily favored. The title of the film gives away the ending but doesn't tell you or show you the improbable, almost impossible, ending to this game. If this was Michigan & Ohio State it would have been the game of the century. For the most part, except for Calvin Hill and Tommy Lee Jones, there are no household names in either lineup. But it's more than just a game, it's Harvard & Yale, the elite of the elite, and it's 1968 and the Vietnam War is at its height and the country has had two more assassinations with MLK & RFK. As exciting as the game was, the film is also a commentary on our country, particularly what was going on in the colleges & universities. The documentary is the game footage interspersed (sometimes in the middle of the play to create suspense) with commentary from the actual players involved in that play. As you might expect, the players are articulate and intelligent. You get a lot more than just comments on the game. Do you want to hear one opinion on why the sexual revolution was going on? Do you want to know what it was like to date Meryl Streep and what was she like as a college co-ed? How about who roomed with Al Gore and George W. Bush and the pranks they were involved in? What of a former decorated Marine just back from Vietnam and what it was like to confront war protestors in front of every classroom building and play on the same team with players who protested and participated in SDS. While I agree that mostly real football fans are going to want to watch this, it has broader appeal than some reviewers give it credit for. It's very well done and entertaining as well as quite a game. A little nostalgia for baby boomer football fans. Enjoy.",1252713600,3,1887,4.363636363636363
3850316,1,B00260LFAQ,"I hope you like Ivy League football, because this documentary is about little else.

Since it made many critics' top ten lists for 2009, I was eager to see it, but the whole time I was for some reason thinking it was about something more than just the famous Harvard-Yale football game of 1968.

Now sure, that's one of the greatest college football games of all time.  Right up until about halftime, Yale was leading 22-0, and Harvard came back in the second half to tie 29-29.  So euphoric was the Harvard Crimson that the next morning they ran the headline ""Harvard Beats Yale 29-29,"" which is where the title of the film comes from.

But since so many critics loved it, I thought there had to be something deeper to it, the way&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-We-Were-Kings/dp/B00007ELEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When We Were Kings</a>&nbsp;was about more than just the Ali-Foreman fight:  it was about the brimming over of social attitudes in the 60's.  Or the Spassky-Fischer chess match of 1972:  really about the Cold War.

I thought this DVD would be something like that, but no.  It really is just about the football game, nothing more, which limited its interest for me.  Sure, some of the interviewees mention things that were going on in the late 60's, such as the sexual revolution and Vietnam, but they're not really woven into the narrative in any meaningful way.

If that legendary Harvard-Yale game ever stood for something more than itself, I have yet to be enlightened.",1252108800,8,1539,5.112
