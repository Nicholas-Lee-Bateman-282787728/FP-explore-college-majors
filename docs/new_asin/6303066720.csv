545585,4,6303066720,"as a huge fan of alexander dumas' creation,i often get offended at the casting choices for his writings...(gene kelly?...hello?)....in fact, my lack of a fifth star rating is only due to the lack of a fifth star in the  role of D'Artagnan. once again, chris o'donnell has taken a vibrant  character and turned him into mush. why on earth does he keep getting these  types of roles. the only ""roles"" he should be getting are  hamburger rolls at burger king...(make that mcdonalds...i actually like  burger king!)....but besides, and in spite of, his disasterous  performance, this movie is by far the finest adaptation yet, with keifer  sutherland as the sturdy, but broken athos, charlie sheen as the musketeer  who is as good with the lord as he is with his sword, aramis, and of  course, tim curry, who never lets me down, but has indeed found his  character as cardinal richeleu...but the surprise in this package is the  brilliant oliver platt who takes his character, porthos, from an excessive  creation and creates a living human being, full of life. it is truly a joy  to see a twentieth cetury actor capture the feel of a period piece, and the  ""three"" musketeers do just that. Another current dumas vehicle,  ""the man in the iron mask"",falls short in that area, except that  gabriel byrne has finally brought some dignity to d'artagnan, and that the  brilliant jeremy irons extends sheen's performance of aramis, to make the  two pieces quite complimentary. even if you've been burned by  ""musketeer"" movies before, fear not...all for one and one for  all....",933120000,2,1569,4.893536121673004

545821,1,6303066720,"I didn't finish watching this because it is laced with immodesty/soft core porn.  Was surprised becaue it was a Disney production.  This came out about the time when Disney began its transformation into an amoral corporation, supporting the usual modern evils.

NOT a wholesome or family work - I should have been clued in when I saw the cast.",1518566400,,343,4.779661016949152

545825,3,6303066720,"Great movie with lots of action scenes and humor.  This movie would benefit from a Blu-Ray release, though.  Bad picture quality, which was obviously intended for older TVs that weren't HD and the picture is windowboxed, meaning it's a small picture in the center of the screen with black bars all around.

545913,3,6303066720,"It's was ok. After growing up with the delightful 1948 version starring Gene Kelley and then the 1973 more complete version with Michael York, I found this version rather choppy and hard to follow. If I didn't already know the story, this version would not have enlightened me. Chris O'Donnell was a fair D'Artagnan, not as athletic or exhuberant as Gene Kelley and nowhere near Michael York as an actor. Kiefer Sutherland looked bored, Charlie Sheen seemed drugged and Oliver Platt was rather predictable.  I did, however, LOVE Tim Curry as Richelieu but he's great in anything!  I suggest you watch this one and the others just to compare and contrast and appreciate the wonderful Dumas story.",1504915200,2,695,4.931623931623932

546002,1,6303066720,"Badly acted: Chris O'Donnell lacks any charm at all and seems to be reading his lines for the first time. What a terrible D'Artagnan. Charlie Sheen turns Aramis into a lecher and delivers every line in the same husky growl for no apparent reason. Kiefer Sutherland as Athos comes off as rude and aggravated. Oliver Platt is miscast as Porthos, lacking the size and build as well as the looks of the handsome ladies' man. Additionally, they turn him into a buffoon. Leaving all that aside, the story ""based on the book"" has nothing in common with the book except the names of the characters and the setting of France in the 17th century. Cardinal Richelieu trying to seize the crown and make alliances with the Duke of Buckingham? The musketeers disbanded in the first few minutes? Athos, Porthos, and Aramis are bad-boy outlaws? My goodness what a piece of garbage.",1497225600,2,865,4.735099337748345

The cast is superb and it's nice to see who they were as young actors - full of spunk and willing to do slapstick comedy.

Oliver Platt's humor is fantastic, Charlie Sheen's religious character is ironic, really, and Kiefer Sutherland is broody and serious - and I enjoy each of them.  Chris O'Donnell's character is young, impetuous, and ""entirely too bold"" and he is the perfect choice for D'Artagnan.  Gabrielle Anwar's Queen, Tim Curry's Cardinal, and Rebecca De Mornay's Countess round out the fantastic cast of this 1993 version of The Three Musketeers.",1482537600,2,456,5.305555555555555

The cast is, imo, perfect. Chris O'Donnel. Keifer Sutherland, Tim Curry, Charlie Sheen, Rebecca De Morany, Michael Wincott, and Oliver Platt are all excellent  in this version.

I am not very familiar with the two actors who play the King and Queen, Hugh O'Conor and Gabrielle Anwar but they are very good, too.

The backdrop, the story and the actors did very, very well. The story is funny and exciting. This is a movie where you cheer for the good guys and while booing the bad guys (namely Tim Curry and Michael Wincott) you enjoyed their performances very much.",1455148800,4,612,4.745283018867925

547417,3,6303066720,"Recently, I've gotten interested in The Three Musketeers, a story I really know nothing about.  Instead of going to the original source, I turned to this Disney movie from 1993.  I remember watching it in the theaters and not being super impressed with it.  Time hasn't changed my opinion of it at all.

D'Artagna (Chris O'Donnell) longs to be a musketeer, so he sets off from his village to travel toParisto join up.  When he arrives, he finds that they have been disbanded on the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry).  However, he soon runs afoul of three of them, Aramis (Charlie Sheen), Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), and Porthos (Oliver Platt).

Then fate changes things, and the four of them must team up to stop a plot by Richelieu and Countess D'Winter (Rebecca DeMornay) to overthrow the king (Hugh O'Conor).  Can they save the young monarch and his wife (Gabrielle Anwar)?

Obviously, I have no idea how this movie compares to the book or even the other movie versions out there.  That's probably a good thing because it means I can just judge it by itself.

The movie is trying to be a somewhat comic version of the story, and there are certainly some scenes that give us some great one liners.  However, it doesn't quite come to the level of a comedy.

Likewise, it doesn't quite work as an action film.  Oh, I have no problem with the mostly bloodless sword fights.  But the scenes are perfunctory and not really that exciting.  The epic battle at the end has some good moments, but that's about it.  Again, it's not that it's bad, but it's not great either.

The characters are likewise passable, but that's about it.  There are some moments in the second half that are supposed to mean something to us emotionally, but they just don't.  In fact, I find the relationship between the king and queen the most emotionally impacting one in the movie.  They're minor characters and I care for them more than our leads.

It's probably because the movie is fairly predictable.  Don't get me wrong, it's fun, but there are no twists you can't see coming from a ways away.

The movie is set some time in the seventeenth century, and they do a good job of recreating the period.  Okay, I'm no expert, but nothing jumped out at me.

I got a big kick out of watching this movie again since I know several of the actors from their recent TV work.  I think they all do a great job here bringing their characters to life.  My issues with the movie are with the script, and not the acting.  Special mention must be made of Tim Curry, who is over the top, but in a delightful way that makes his scenes as the villain all the more fun.  He walks a fine line and pulls it off perfectly.

It's easy to pick on the many issues in Disney's The Three Musketeers, but it's not all bad.  It's entertaining enough while you're watching it, but this also isn't one to rush out and watch.  If you catch it you'll enjoy it, but I'm sure there are better versions of the story out there.",1433635200,,2971,4.462825278810409

Rebecca De Mornay was am outstanding Lady Dewinter, as well as all the other cast members including Charlie Sheen.  Tim Curry was a little more demonstratively wacky as a bad guy, even though he was supposed to be a Cardinal, Charlton Heston did a better version in my opinion.

After I rented the HD version from Amazon, which is great because of no commercials, the segment that I had seen on TV was much lighter in contrast. On the Amazon channel, the image was very dark and it was hard to discern the characters in what happened to be a dark scene, the dungeons. I have no idea why. Same television, same movie, different image, different provider.  Is it the streaming?",1409961600,,499,4.365591397849462
548480,5,6303066720,"I don't get it.  This movie was a hit in the fall of 1993.  Why does Disney treat this film as if it was a bomb.  Where is the Blu-Ray?

The only drawback one can come away after watching this movie is that it strays from the original novel but so does most of the Hollywood incarnations of this story.  However, it does a good job telling its own tale of intrigue, adventure, love, betrayal, and good versus evil.  Mostly its just a heck of a fun movie.  Its not just a thrill ride though as it actually features genuinely likable (often comedic) performances from its cast...including Charlie Sheen (well yes its 16th century Sheen but it fits with his character, Aramis).  Tim Curry is exceptionally wicked as the Cardinal in this film.  The film also boasts excellent direction, cinematography, music score, sets and costume.  An A-list film that deserves to be remastered on Blu-Ray.",1409702400,,888,4.670967741935484

549506,3,6303066720,"The 1973 ""The Three Musketeers"" and 1974 ""The Four Musketeers"" will always hold the place as the best version of this story. However, this Disney version does have some things to recommend it. Namely, the wonderful Oliver Platt who ably brings to life Porthos and has a sparkling rapport with Charlie Sheen's Aramis. Rebecca DeMornay is a able Milady DeWinter although she is hampered by major character changes the writers' force upon her. Kiefer Sutherland and Chris O'Donnell do fairly well as Athos and D'Artagnan, however they are more shallow interpretations than the versions created by Oliver Reed and Michael York respectively.

On the negative.the writers took some major liberties with the story that do not make sense and do not enhance the story at all. Milady DeWinter is rewritten to become a sympathetic and redeemed character. The Duke of Buckingham is written out. And Cardinal Richelieu becomes a moustache twirling, over the top, bad guy (although no one does over the top with more panache than Tim Curry).

If you want a more accurate, better written, acted and produced version, see the '73 and '74 editions. They are funnier and the action scenes cannot be beaten.",1382486400,2,1188,5.025380710659898

First you have, Chris O'Donnell as D'Artagnan, the bold yet innocent aspiring musketeer.
Then you have Charlie Sheen (Tiger Blood+Sword=Amazing) and he plays Aramis (the Preist/Musketeer).
Oliver Platt plays a great rendition of Porthos
Finally, to round out the musketeer greatness, Jack Bauer himself Kiefer Sutherland plays Athos. Jack Bauer with a sword, is a thing of beauty.

There are key plot elements that are left out, like just about anything relating to the politics between France and England.

When watched today, this movie sort of reads like a who's who of early 1990s films:  Charlie Sheen, Tim Curry, Kiefer Sutherland, Rebecca DeMornay, Oliver Platt, Chris O'Donnell.  The acting is decent, as can be expected from a bunch of A-listers from that time period.  The action scenes are fun, exciting, and entertaining, and just about as squeaky clean as you can expect from a movie full of sword fighting sequences, probably due to the ""Disney"" affiliation.

I've seen the serious version of this movie and, given a choice, I kind of lean to this one.  Kiefer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, and Oliver Platt are totally insane as Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.  Chris O'Donnell is absolutely great as D'Artanian, and Tim Curry plays a perfectly e-e-evil and lecherous Cardinal Richelieu.

Even the romp with Gene Kelly and Lana Turner back in the day remained basically faithful to the book on which it was adapted.  The screenwriters of this version decided that the Dumas story wasn't good enough and needed improvement. At least I'm assuming that's what was going on in their head, because at it's core Dumas' The Three Musketeers is an historical fiction, meaning general historical facts tend to remain intact, so I can imagine a generation of kids flunking French history thinking that Cardinal Richelieu died in a burning underground lake after being punched by King Louis.

In addition to unnecessary revisions of French history, liberties taken in dumbing down the book for young adults, meaning characters with complex motivations like Rochefort are made into stereotypical villains.

This is bad filmmaking no matter how you look at it that treats it's audience as brainless. It's worst offense; however, is that when you go to see a Musketeer movie you at least expect some fantastic swordfighting choreography of which this movie had none. The story is Charlie Sheen was filmming another movie at the time and couldn't make fencing lessons.  It shows.  Disney can do much better than this.",1342396800,,1304,5.0418604651162795

Rate: 1

9/10: What they did with the novel The Three Musketeers for the film is to bastardize it and blatantly steal the names of the characters while making up a total rubbish of a story. I am not going to say that Alexandre Dumas must be spinning in his grave. Rather, anybody associated with the film should be tarred, feathered, and finally quartered. Spare no one. As for the erroneous information displayed in the film, I must respectfully point out a couple of them. One, you can't make a cardinal a king no matter what. He has no rightful claim to the throne. His duty is to church and only the church. If the king passes away, then the queen takes over. If she is dead, then the brother of the king or whoever is legally granted the right. But the cardinal? Impossible. Two, Anne of Austria was married to the King of France to create an alliance between Spain and France, not Austria and France...jeez. Get the facts straight. I am not going to bother with the inaccuracies of the story presented in the film because it is too obvious that the movie isn't about The Three Musketeers. While at it, why bother titling the movie The Three Musketeers if it bears no resemblance to the novel? The cast is horribly wrong for each of the characters; it's just a blasphemy. The fencing is the stuff of boredom and bad schooling. In the book, the overused slogan is only uttered once and never again, but in the film, it became obscenely too much for me. All in all, The Three Musketeers is pure garbage.",1342051200,6,1519,4.4640287769784175

The costumes look like they just came from the costume department, the hair styles look like they just came from hair-and-makeup, the accents and dialogue are right off the streets of LA, the story has been butchered from the original by Alexandre Dumas, the scenes are full of idiotic business (as opposed to the clever action of the 1974 version), the acting is mediocre (none of these actors hold a candle to the '74 cast), etc. The worst insult of all is that Dumas' novel is an historical novel, based on actual people and events; but NOTHING in this film has ANYTHING to do with history. The thing is, no one cares anymore. No one cares if a great novel is butchered, or if a great film is forgotten in order to make room for a truly mediocre one. No one cares about details, facts or nuance. The anachronisms in this film would fill a book. I don't know, I just believe that if you're going to do something, you ought to do it well; not force a great narrative into a Hollywood story formula, and expect the actors to act like their doing great work. It breaks my heart that movie-making has gotten to this, and that American audiences don't care. There was a time when they did, but no more. So if all you want is something to watch while you munch your popcorn, then go ahead and enjoy this. But if you want to see Alexandre Dumas' novel come to life, watch the 1974 version, plus the 1975 followup, The Four Musketeers, which was filmed at the same time.

By the way: people always criticized the 1948 Gene Kelly version for its slick Hollywood handling of the story. Well, this 1993 version is just as slick and just as bad for the same reasons. After you watch the 1974 version, watch the 1948 version and see if you can tell why these two films are both inferior to the 1974 version. Compare Richard Chamberlain's elegant Aramis, Oliver Reed's Athos, Charlton Heston's Richelieu, Faye Dunaway's Milady de Winter, Jean-Pierre Cassel's Louis XIII, Michael York's D'Artagnan, Christopher Lee's Rochefort, Simon Ward's Duke of Buckingham (who didn't even appear in the 1993 version) - even Raquel Welch's Constance. Compare the costumes and sets, which were really authentic and made you feel like you were actually in that period. Compare the action and the business, which were really very clever. Compare the humor, which the 1993 version copied from the 1974 one. Compare everything. There's just no comparison.

As my title suggests, most of the names are spot-on accurate... but that's almost where the similarity between this film and its source material ends. A few bits are also retained, and some general characterizations (Athos drinks, etc.), but the actual plot events are completely done away with, as are the deeper portrayals of character. Richelieu is no longer the genius, subtle, behind-doors politician, but becomes Snidely Whiplash v. 2.0. Constance Bonacieux loses her last name, her husband, her lines, her importance to the plot, and is thrown in as an afterthought. The Musketeers themselves lose a considerable amount of depth and vigor -- Oliver Platt is hardly the jolly giant that Porthos needs to be (instead presented as mostly a clown, here), and D'Artagnan himself becomes an unsteady, uncertain child instead of the fearless, reckless, arrogant and hot-tempered youth of the novel.

All of this said... the movie is... decent. It's fun enough, I suppose, to see guys sword fighting, spilling out one-liners in true 90s film fashion. Rebecca de Mornay is beautiful (and is an inspired casting decision, regardless of how they treated her character), Tim Curry plays Whiplashelieu to the hilt, and Kiefer Sutherland is an ideal Athos.

If a person comes to this movie with no knowledge of the novel, or is able to somehow forget it, they'll probably be entertained. It's still not *great* cinema, but that's understandable as it never aspired to be. It wanted to be a fun, popcorn-chomping romp, and at that, it does its job. Or, at least 3-Stars worth of it.

Still, I have to wonder a little bit. If you have a wonderful property to work with like Dumas' novel, the budget and the talent to pull it off in reasonable fashion, why would you completely throw out the story (and almost completely throw out the characters) that has made it so famous and so lasting, and replace it with a generic action script? The original is long and complicated, and I understand the difficulties inherent to condensing it to a 90 minute feature. Maybe this film played it safe, in offering up the usual Hollywood-fare. But playing it safe can only ever bring limited success, and whatever its box-office at the time, this film doesn't hold up that well a decade and a half later.

For those truly interested: read the book, instead. It is better in every way.",1217376000,6,2525,4.822170900692841

This movie version of the Three Musketeers compares to the book written by Alexander Dumas in the same way Broadway show Cats compares to the 1957 movie The Ten Commandments.

Probably one of the more glaring examples is that this DVD contains a plot by Cardinal Richelieu to assassinate the King on his 16th birthday. In the book Dumas wrote the King and Queen were in their thirties, and there was no assassination plot at all, although the Cardinal was trying to discredit the Queen by exposing a love affair between her and the English Duke of Buckingham - a rather one sided thing not readily returned by the Queen.",1203292800,4,1113,4.5

1) This film has nothing to do with the book.  The names and places might be the same, but the story and characters are completely different.  I wonder if the screenwriters even bothered to read the book.

2) While a Disney film and rated PG, it is not appropriate for little children. The scenes in the catacombs and the multiple inuendos made me wonder why the film wasn't rated PG-13.

Then there were the movies which were made well before my time, but reflected some very good renditions of the book.  Somehow I do not believe the producers of this movie had any idea about how to reproduce such an adventure.

Pity, once upon a time Disney was the king of Fairy Tales, and Adventure.  What has happened to that Disney movie making magic?

The magic is no longer there, and the actors, well I really wish there had been some effort put forth by the actors.  The acting was drab to say the least.

The costumes were the star of the movie, at least they seemed to have gotten that part right.  The film's settings and landscape were a pretty good dipiction as well.  This was something of a dark tale, and far too much of this movie took place in the daytime.

The casting was superb with Kiefer Sutherland as Athos, Oliver Platt as Porthos, Charlie Sheen as Aramis, and Chris O'Donnell and Dartagnan. Tim Curry was OUTSTANDING AND ASTOUNDING as Cardinal Richeleu, he went from genius to the brink of madness, in many scenes. The action scenes were excellent, and the comdey was just wonderful. Oliver Platt did an exceptional job at delivering his lines in the comedic portions. Kiefer Sutherlands portrayal of anguished Athos was done with such aplomb and grace that in many scenes I just got caught up in it all. Charlie Sheen's portrayal of Aramis was played with serious undertones yet he also portrayed a certain rogue gentleman, and when he was called on for comedy, he never failed to deliver. This movie was a huge break for Chris O'Donnell, and he mixed it up well with these other fine actors, especially playing off Keifer Sutherland, Rebecca De Mornay, and Oliver Platt. They way he delivered his lines, and the way he moved in the action scenese, proved that he was not a fluke, but a good young actor. Rebecca De Mornay portrayed her character Sabine DeWinter with such charm and seduction, that you almost root for her to get away with it all. Gabrielle Anwar who played the Queen, almost made this movie with her understated scenes and lines with King Louis played by Hugh O'Conner. Their portrayal as the King and Queen made me feel compassion and at the end, made me feel so much respect for them. July Delpy as Constance the Queen's lady in waiting, had a few scenes, but her portrayal was great, she was able to give us the viewers a delivery that was on par with the rest of the actors/actresses. And last but not least, Michael Winters who plays the evil, Rochefort, was to me one of the greatest performances I have ever seen in a movie. I was blown away by how wonderfully this movie was cast, and how it was acted. I cannot imagine any other people playing these roles. I have seen pretty much every other variation of the Three Musketeers, and have always found them stuffy, overbearing, and annoying. But this variation, kept me on the edge of my seat in anticipation, and at the same time laughing so hard I about fell off of it. The beautiful landscapes, and scenery really added to the movie, and I did not find anything at all to gripe about in this movie. Rarely does a movie have this much of an impact, and I without shame place this as my all time favorite movie EVER. And that's above the original Star Wars Trilogy, and the LOTR trilogy. I give this movie the highest I possibly could, and I recommend buying this movie, no collection is complete without it.

P.S. Be careful, about taking drinks during certain parts of the movie, you may spew them on other people watching with you.",1138147200,23,2906,4.5458015267175576
551250,5,6303066720,"I see many complaining that this movie isn't historically accurate and/or true to the book. If you are thinking about getting this movie, get it, it's great. It's very enjoyable and not meant to be history or true to the book in favor of being enjoyable by a much broader audience.

Complaining about accuracy on this movie is like burning Cinderella as trash for the same reasons. Ever read the original versions of Cinderella? It's most certainly NOT for children. The movie and printed Disney versions are far from true to the original tale. Fact is, Cinderella and The Three Musketeers aren't the only ones Disney drastically toned down.

Perhaps those who don't like this one's accuracy would wish to have their children watch the stepsisters' self mutilations in attempting to make their feet fit the slipper and pigeons pecking out their eyes in Cinderella, and maybe heads rolling in The Three Musketeers, etc. But I doubt many will want their children watching such things.

Disney produces for family entertainment in films such as these. They don't get concerned over accuracy because it's not a film to stimulate prolonged historical discussion and debate between parents and ten year olds, but merely to entertain.

I love a good historically accurate movie, but I know when to drop that concern and just enjoy a good bit of fiction. That's what this is, and as far as I know, Disney never claimed it was anything more.

Besides, no one knows how accurate any bit of history is beyond a few minutes past, which is why one piece of history will have at least as many variations as there are historians that have studied the subject.

551359,4,6303066720,"Because of the departure of the story from the Alexandre Dumas book, some may not like this movie.  However, if you think of this movie as having been inspired by the book you will enjoy it a lot more.  The action is good, the movie is reasonably family friendly, and the sprinkling of comedy fills in the transitions.  However, people are killed during the fighting and Tim Curry as Cardinal Richelieu is sincerely evil, so those without any taste for violence should avoid this movie.

The story is generally familiar.  Aramis (Charlie Sheen), Porthos (Oliver Platt) and Athos (Kiefer Sutherland) meet would be Musketeer D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell).  Initially D'Artagnan is unaware that Athos, Porthos and Aramis are Musketeers, and the three Musketeers are unaware the D'Artagnan is the son of a Musketeer and desires to be a Musketeer himself.  Unfortunately for D'Artagnan the Musketeers had just quit en masse because Cardinal Richelieu had replaced the Musketeers, who guarded King Louis (Hugh O'Conor), with his own guards, led by Rochefort (played by Michael Wincott in a most sinister fashion).

From this beginning the movie speeds up.  The story becomes complex as we learn that Lady Sabine de Winter is on a traitorous mission for Cardinal Richelieu.  The Musketeers and D'Artagnan must stop her or France may be doomed.  However, we learn that Lady de Winter knows one of the Musketeers, whom she has not seen for many years.  We also learn that the Cardinal has a nefarious plan that he will execute on the King's birthday.

The end of this movie is a lot of fun as, in true swashbuckler style, there is generous swordplay and fantastic escapes.  I believe that the stars of swashbuckling movies of the past would appreciate this movie.

I have read reviews that both praise this movie and pan it.  This movie is not true to the original story.  However, it is very entertaining and I have enjoyed this one several times.  I know I will enjoy watching it again.  In recent years Disney has had difficulties in creating movies in the tradition started by Walt Disney.  However, this one is worthy of the Disney name.

Stephen Herek (""Man Of The House"") directs this bold take on the classic adventure novel by the great Alexandre Dumas, who also wrote two sequels to ""The Three Musketeers,"" ""The Count Of Monte Cristo,"" ""Le Reine Margot,"" ""The Black Tulip,"" among others). Taking the basic portions of the novel, screenwriter David Loughery made it more for kids, throwing in just the right amount of humor, suspense and non-graphic action that audiences expected from a film adaptation of the novel, changing Lady De Winter's (played to a perfect S by the sensual Rebecca DeMornay) very complicated first name, making the Cardinal (wonderfully played to a T by screen villain Tim Curry) somewhat of a lecher and a traitor/  making D'Artagnan more of the protagonist than he is in the novel. He also completely leaves out the backstory on how Lady De Winter became evil, Athos' connection with Lord De Winter, Rochefort eluding D'Artagnan until the end of the story, King Louis XIII being a cruel and jealous s.o.b. (an aspect that was corrected very well in the movie; should've been developed more, however, but it probably would've made it PG-13 or R, had he done so), Madame Bonacieux's (here simply called Constance, her first name in the novel) foul murder, the Puritan assassin Felton, the Duke Of Buckingham (only mentioned here) and the servants of the four, just to name several details. If you're a purist, then this movie isn't for you. But if you're open-minded and want a fresh look at the classic novel, combined with Disney fun, then THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU.

Everyone in the film did a great job, especially Michael Wincott as the villainous (and one-eyed here) Captain Rochefort (in the novel, he's also a Count). The backstory of how he murdered King Louis XIII's father, as part of an insidious plot by Richelieu, killing D'Artagnan's father in the process, should've been explored further, so that the ""Loose ends"" could be ""Tied up."" Good way to do it, though. The theme song ""All For Love"" (also included on the VHS) was great, performed by Bryan Adams (who sang ""Everything I Do"" at the end of ""Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves"" [see my review of that film in conjunction with the 1938 classic starring screen legend Errol Flynn]), Rod Stewart and Sting, with music by Michael Kamen (who also scored ""Licence To Kill"" [see my review on that] and ""Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves"") was very well done. The only other feature on the DVD (a trailer would've also been neat) is a 3-minute production featurette. The 2:35 widescreen aspect ratio is astounding. All in all, great film. The 3 Musketeers movies (and yes, I'm including the abominable ""Return Of The Musketeers"" in this one)starring Michael York are shallow and pathetic, as they're very bawdy and take too many liberties with the novel. This film is a family-friendly version of the novel, so sit back and enjoy. Rated PG for some violence.",1121904000,6,3884,4.964669738863288
551362,5,6303066720,"In 1993, Walt Disney had produced another hit movie entitled, THE THREE MUSKETEERS. This is film that is definitely for all ages and up, and it is extremely enjoyable.

  RICHELIEU (played by Tim Curry) is the Carnial of France. He is in cohoots with ROCHEFORT (played by Michael Wincott), and they plan to kill the King of France. Their first mission was to fire the King's musketeers. All the musketeers have turned in their capes, all but three: ATHOS (played by Kiefer Sutherland), ARAMIS (played by Charlie Sheen), & PORTHOS (played by Oliver Platt). Seems as though they do not want to give up on their royal leader.

  Arriving in France is the young and courageous, D'ARTAGNAN (played by Chris O'Donnell). He has arrived to join the musketeers, since his late father was a musketeer until he was murdered. As he enters, he meets the beautiful CONSTANCE (played by Julie Delpy), as well as meeting Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Each of them challenge him to a fight. His fight with Athos isn't until 12:00 pm. His fight with Porthos isn't until 1:00 pm. His fight with Aramis isn't until 2:00 pm. D'Artagnan shows up to his fight with Athos, to which Porthos and Aramis show up as well, where they reveal their true identity to the young D'Artagnan: They are musketeers. Some of the Cardinal's men come along, forcing the musketeers and D'Artagnan into battle. Realizng who D'Artagnan's father was, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis decide to let D'Artagnan help them out in this little battle, but soon after, they ditch him, where he is captured and brought into the hands of Cardinal Richelieu.

  He overhears a conversation between Richelieu and the beautiful LADY DE WINTER (played by Rebecca de Mornay), where they plan to not only kill the King of France, but to kill the Queen as well, where Richelieu and Lady will be King & Queen. Richelieu forces D'Artagnan to reveal the whereabouts of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, but he refuses since he has know clue, to which he adds, ""...And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you..."" Richelieu orders that D'Artagnan be decapitated. The two beheaders are actually...Aramis and Porthos. They are here to rescue their young recruiter.

  That night, D'Artagnan wanders off alone, after being wounded. Seems as though his wound is only superficial. He is rescued by Lady De Winter, only so she can kill him. But he stops her, to which she and some guards take him off on a boat, where Athos, Porthos, and Aramis are awaiting to rescue him once more, which leads Lady De Winter into killing herself.

  The morning has arrived where the King and Rochefort plan to go through with their plan, but Athos, Porthos, and Aramis have recruited the rest of the musketeers, with the help of D'Artagnan to protect their royal leader. Rochefort was killed by D'Artagnan, with the help of Constance, since Rocherfort had killed D'Artagnan's father. The Cardinal was placed under rest for treason and attemped murder. For saving his life, the King asks what it is that D'Artagnan wants in return. His request: to become a musketeer. And a musketeer D'Artagnan becomes.

  I have really enjoyed this film. Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, and Oliver Platt were picture perfect choices for Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Chris O'Donnell, in my opinion was a bad choice for D'Artagnan. The other three were rugged looking, with long hair and goatee's, while Chris O'Donnell has a young baby face. Tim Curry and Michael Wincott make me wanna grab a bottle of Pepto, because their acting makes me sick and I dislike them both. But this movie was thoroughly enjoyable and I strongly recommend to everybody.",1117065600,2,3627,4.8603896103896105

551365,5,6303066720,"This movie, while perhaps not authentic, is a lot of fun, period!

 While many ""Dumas"" purists may be upset by the liberties taken with the story, this movie has a lot of entertainment value. I also have no problem letting my kids watch this movie . There are some subtle innuendos but they never crossed the line in my opinion to the point where most kids would even have a frame of reference in which to understand them. But, to each his own, I'm more concerned about gratuitous violence in a movie than innuendos of the sort found in this film.

 I thought the actors and actresses did a perfectly fine job for the type of movie that it is (an entertaining light film with just enough tension in it, like that big ugly guy in the prison), in particular I thought Oliver Platt as Porthos was particularly entertaining and of course Tim Curry was excellent in his role as Cardinel Richelieu and Michael Wincott as Rochefort was an excellent secondary villain.

 I've watched this movie many many times already and it's one of those that we pull off the shelf from time to time to watch as a family, along with other standby's like ""The Princess Bride"",  ""Robin Hood Men In Tights"" and ""The Holy Grail"".

 I would also like to say that I thought those folks who recommended the earlier version of ""the Three Musketeers"" w/ Michael York, Rachel Welch etc. were also right on the money! Those movies (The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers) are fabulous and timeless classic versions which are also immeasurably entertaining!

My only complaint with the DVD is it's lacking in the special features. There's nor delete scenes nor trailer, and the only two extras are the music video for the theme ""All For Love"" and a featurette.

The line up of actors for this film is quite incredible.  The starring cast consist of Keifer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, Tim Curry, and Rebecca De Mornay.  Not only was the cast incredible, the title track All For Love is performed by Sting, Bryan Adams, and Rod Stewart.  Can you imagine the cost of making this movie today?
This movie resonates the very essence of Action Film.  The fighting, racing horses, and dueling almost never end. Did I mention this was an action film?  The violence in this film is more by implication than gruesome portrayals of death and fighting.
Add to the action a high dose of comedy.  Oliver Platt is hilarious as Porthos.  Tim Curry adds whit and humor to the evil character of Cardinal Richelieu.
The Three Musketeers was filmed on location in Europe which adds a believability that allows the viewer to be swept away into the story.

551446,5,6303066720,"As I read the book I realized that the casting on this movie was superb even if the story line leaves that of the book's after the initial duel and the entire plot line would make only one chapter in the original book.  This is still a great movie even if it doesn't follow the book beyond the names.  I have watched this countless times and will watch it many more.  I still laugh at the jokes and get tense with the suspense.
D'Artagnan has come to Paris to join the musketeers but when he gets to Paris, he finds that the musketeers have just been disbanded by the Cardinal under approval from the Regent King (although the King disapproves of the timing and manner).  He quickly runs afoul of Athos, Porthos and Aramis and has duels scheduled with each an hour apart at the old convent.  Just as the swords are crossed, the Cardinal's men appear to arrest them and d'Artagnan makes a stand with the three musketeers thereby not only making him an outlaw but making a favorable impression with his new comrades who recognize his father's name as a valiant musketeer that died in service to the king. From there on, the movie bears absolutely no resemblance to the book (and d'Artagnan's father was not dead or a musketeer). When d'Artagnan is arrested and interrogated about the whereabouts of the three musketeers, he overhears plans of the Cardinal's to send a secret treaty to the Duke of Buckingham (""who rules England the way the Cardinal rules France"") in an attempt to overthrow the King's rule and claim the crown for himself.  Rescued from the chopping block by the three musketeers, they immediately give chase to the Cardinal's messenger as his henchmen all over the country pursue them to claim the reward for their capture.  It is a thrilling, action packed chase with a wonderful climax and lots of great zingers from Porthos.  I honestly do not think any other actors alive could have pulled off these characters as well as Keifer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen and Oliver Platt.
The spirit of Dumas' musketeers is alive and well with these four.  Charlie Sheen is excellent as the dark eyed and dreamily romantic Aramis with a fervor for religion. Keifer Sutherland's reserved air is perfect for the noble and quiet Athos.  Oliver Platt is exactly what and how I picture Porthos.  Both men and women will love this movie for the perfect mix of adventure and romance.

551447,4,6303066720,"Alexandre Dumas may or may have not liked the Disney version of his story, but your whole family should. This often remade classic is more comedic in this version. I personally liked it. But then I have liked most versions in their style. The 1973 version with Oliver Reed as Athos and this version with Keifer Sutherland as Athos stand out above the rest in my humble opinion. The 1973 version for the drama and this one for the comedy.

Tim Curry is marvelous as Cardinal Richelieu. He is so borderline outrageously lecherous you think he is going to burst out laughing like a madman or go into song from ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"". He never plays the piety like Charlton Heston did in the 1973 version. He goes more for the deviousness of an outright power mad religious leader.
The entire cast is great. With Charlie Sheen, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, and Rebecca DeMornay how could it be anything but well acted. I would bet the entire cast had a great time filming this version. The dramatic parts with DeMornay as Lady DeWinter are quite touching and the comedic parts with Porthos the Pirate, played by Platt, are quite funny. I was impressed with Stephen Herek's direction.

Disney did a great job of transferring this movie to DVD. The DVD picture and sound quality is first class. The DVD includes a featurette, theatrical trailers, and Bios.

551448,1,6303066720,"A simply terrible, limp, half-hearted, ""joke-y"" remake of The Three Musketeers that simply did not need to be remade. There is an excellent version by Richard Lester (with Raquel Welch, Oliver Reed etc.) which is not dated at all and has wonderful performances and equisite sets and costumes...it is also extremely funny.
So the only motivation here must have been the BUCKS...a remake with Brat Packer stars like Kiefer Sutherland and Charlie Sheen. The script is wretched and the jokes stale, TV-type and not very funny. Completely out of period and needless to say unfaithful in the extreme to the spirit of the book.
It isn't often you need to specifically mention BAD COSTUMES as ruining a film....either they are splendid (as in Lester's Three/Four Musketeers) or not worth mentioning at all. Here one simply has to mention how awful they are! They don't look the least bit authentic, and the female characters are clearly dressed in clothes from another century, and not the 17th either. Polyester positively gleams and many characters are in clothing that is obviously the wrong size. The only thing I could guess is that the producers were unwilling to make a full complement of period costumes for a movie with such a big cast, and raided some cheap-o wardrobe rental place for items. Even the female leads look cheaply dressed and tacky.
Anything good at all to say? Michael Wincott (Rochefort) and Rebecca DeMornary were clearly not warned that this was a frivolous silly project, so they actually ACT and turn in sincere performances that would have worked well in a REAL movie. This despite appalling costumes and hairdoes -- Wincott in glitter and DeMornay with a beehive hairdo that has to be see to be believed.
Everybody else clearly got that this was a big joke and made off with their paychecks. Tim Curry chews the scenery like a rapid dog and everybody else seems half asleep.

The underrated Kiefer Sustherland (Flatliners, 24) especially is very good, as are Michael Wincott and Tim Curry as the villains. Oliver Platt (Lake Placid, The West Wing) is probably at his most entertaining as well. There's a lot of swashbuckling fun that is bound to entertain you as well. This film is superior to the most recent The Musketeer almost in every way.",1016668800,,653,4.495798319327731

Who can watch and not appreciate the talent displayed by the actors to make the story come to life, the action, the perfect mix of everything a movie should have!

551639,5,6303066720,"I must agree with everyone who wrote reviews on this movie that it is not at all like the book by Dumas, but I don't think that's a good reason not to like this movie. It's lots of fun and has plenty of action and adventure. And I think that's it's not only great for kids but for teenagers and adults alike.
Here's the summary of ""The Three Musketeers"". Chris O'Donnel is D'Artagnan, a young, brash, proud, yet courageous 'kid' whose only dream is to become one of the king's musketeers. But when he gets to Paris, he finds that the musketeers have been disbanded by the young King Louis's (Hugh O'Conor) evil Cardinal, Richelieu (Tim Curry). But three musketeers who are the best of friends, Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Aramis (Charlie Sheen), and Porthos (Oliver Platt), are suspicious of Cardinal Richelieu and his henchman Rochefort (Michael Wincott). D'Artagnan is put in jail for fighting the Cardinal's guards with the three musketeers. Though he tries to escape yet fails, he is able to overhear the Cardinal's plan to take over the throne, building an alliance with the Duke of Buckingham by way of a special courier, Lady DeWinter (Rebecca De Mornay). And before D'Artagnan is executed, Athos, Aramis, and Porthos rescue him and together set out to stop Richelieu's spy. They do intercept her, finding out that Lady DeWinter was actually Athos's wife, whom had betrayed him and him sending her away. At the last moment they find out that the Cardinal is planning to have the king assisinated on his birthday. The four men return as swiftly as possible to Paris and with the help of all the musketeers, stop Richelieu.
As I said, though this movie has plenty of funny and humorous parts, it still has plenty of action and adventure, with a touch of romance here and there. The fighting is really good, and the acting was terrific, especially all the three musketeers, Tim Curry, and Michael Wincott. I love the endless little 'extras' Porthos always has with him!
An enjoyable film which is very entertaining! I also recommend for you to watch ""The Three Musketeers"" which was made in the early 1970's.",1000857600,37,2111,4.786301369863014
551640,4,6303066720,"I have never read Alexandre Dumas's book.
I have never seen any of the other versions of this movie.
You may say that those last two sentences explain why I liked this movie so much, or some who have read all my other reviews can chalk it up to my love of medieval adventure swordfight films. All I know was that I was feeling really bored and apathetic at the time I saw it last week and it brightened me up immediately.
It started doing this by making Oliver Platt a musketeer, something I never would have imagined. Then it took a good score (and a song with Sting, Rod Stewart, and that other guy whose name I didn't get) and put them in the movie. Then it added lots of swordfights, which were good enough. The plot may not have been like the original, but it was viable and it flowed well. The actors were good, they came through in their roles. It was an enjoyable film.
P.S. Due to frequent suggestions made on other reviews on this site, I will rent the previous versions of this film and watch them. I can take a hint: they're good.",999216000,2,1042,4.241206030150754

The acting is warm; the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and there's plenty of good comedic dialogue.  Bloodless violence and subtle sexual innuendo leaves this a family film fit for any over the age of 8.  It is fun.  It is escapist.  It is entertaining.  Not ""great film"" but a heck of a lot better than a lot in that exalted category.
If, on the other hand, you insist on historical accuracy, slavish adherence to Dumas' masterpiece, and grim permeating darkness, you won't care for this film a bit.  Real film critics probably don't like the film...but then they almost never like what I do.  The acting isn't crisp; the plot is only vaguely believable.  The filming is adequate, but not inspired.",993600000,2,784,4.575539568345324

There were several great lines and hysterical scenes, and it was obvious that the actors had fun making it.  Who can resist a film where the actors are obviously enjoying themselves?

The only thing that I liked about this movie was the phenominal acting of Mr. Curry, of course. His talent to take the rottenest script and make it bearable is something that all great actors should posess. Unfortunately, even his cool character and all his beliveability came to an end at his demise: He was punched, then he fell off a boat, and ""drowned"" in obviously shallow water. That was the doing of the writers. Not even Tim Curry could salvage this ending.
Dumas is rolling in his grave at pure mention of this new, Disney brand of nauseating film. I wholly reccomend that, instead of enduring the worst of ""Disney Magic,"" you read the book and watch the more accurate movies, which you will find on a search for ""The Three Musketeers.""

The movie has a lot  of action but does not possess the excitement of the Gene kelly and  Chamberlain versions. Chris O'Donnel's heavy American accent immediatley  detracts from the realism needed to enjoy this film. D'Artagnan is supposed  to be French,you know. A diction coach should have at least tried to make  his accent neutral. The costumes are fantastic as well as the scenery, but  these aren't sufficient to make the film memorable. The swordfight  choreography stinks, but of course, nothing can top Gene Kelly's classic  swordplay. The only redeeming factor is Tim Curry's performance as  Richelieu. He definitley did Vincent Price one better. I saw the film on  screen and on video, and during both occasion, I dozed off during the  supposedly climactic fight sequences. I don't recommend that you keep a  copy of this version. It is best seen once.

Oliver Platt is the most  entertaining as Porthos, with his ""Queen of America"" and  ""Tsarina of Tokyo.""  Keifer Sutherland's Athos can sometimes be  hard to believe, but he pulled it off.  Gabrielle Anwar was lovely as Anne,  but the king was almost as pretty is she is.  Tim Curry plays the bad guy  perfectly, even if he is a little unbelievable.  I love Porthos and his  never ending supply of little weapons.  The movie is full of some of the  best one-liners I have ever heard.  Basically, if you want the real story,  read the book.

The book upon which this movie is allegedly  based is wonderful, and the movie, to put it simply, isn't.
The movie has  the same basic plot, but it has been turned into a typical Disney  slapstick.  Although the jokes are often relatively funny and the actors  are obviously having fun with themselves, it really doesn't fit in the  plot.  The story of the book is also incredibly simplified, and the main  characters have been given typical ""hero"" makeovers.  Still, the  swordfights aren't horrible, and Curry is great as a sadistic, sarcastic  Richelieu.
If you enjoy fun, light adventure movies, then this is a good  choice, but if you're looking for a solid adaptation of Dumas' classic  novel, look elsewhere.",956793600,3,890,4.814569536423841
