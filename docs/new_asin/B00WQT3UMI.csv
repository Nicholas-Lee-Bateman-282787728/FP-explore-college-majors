7148602,1,B00WQT3UMI,Don't cop out -- we want a blu ray!,1436486400,5,35,3.0
7148603,5,B00WQT3UMI,"Clouds of Sils Maria, the latest work from auteur director Olivier Assayas, is one of those films that leaves a deep impression. Its warm and intimate in ways movies simply aren't anymore, and the characters in it are the same way. Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart - who play the ones we so closely get to know - are simply wonderful together, possibly being the most interesting duo youll see on screen all year. These people aren't afraid to be vulnerable, or show their idiosyncrasies, and thats precisely what makes them so human and comforting. Its a movie that I got lost in (in a good way) and gravitated towards immediately.

Binoche plays one of the most renowned actresses in Hollywood, having starred in a seminal play and film based on the same material that made her career twenty years earlier, but is now confronted with starring in a new stage production of that same play. Shes hesitant, but excepts the challenge, and the film centers around her struggle to deal with the difficult script that she hasn't visited in so long, and her looming age over everything she does. That, along with the fascinating relationship she has with her assistant (Stewart), which quickly becomes the focus.

Both of these women are charming beyond belief, spending the good majority of their screen-time together, and their constant rapport is one of the main reasons why I liked the film so much. Of course, you have breathtaking cinematography and a really distinct directing style from Assayas, but these characters are unmatched. We don't simply get acquainted with them, we know them. Its an immediate thing from the first few scenes alone. Each moment flows so beautifully to the next, and the precision is something to marvel at. That, in a nutshell, is why I found it to be so brilliant.",1435795200,82,1798,4.834415584415584
7148604,4,B00WQT3UMI,"This is a film about films (about the complex relationship that exists between art and life) but it never feels abstract or analytical because it is also (and more importantly) a film about relationships and identities and emotions (every scene is saturated with confused, complex, and often contradictory human emotions which are clearly ""real"" even if they are brought to the surface by art, by games of pretend).

There is absolutely no certainty or stability in Maria's (Julliete Binoche) life. She has acheived international fame in her twenty plus year acting career but the only stability and only support system she has is provided by her very capable (but woefully underappreciated) personal assistant Valentine (Kristen Stewart) whose professional devotion to Maria is complicated by an even more intense personal devotion.  On one level the film is about Maria's preparation for a role but on another and much more important level the film is about Maria coming to terms with both her 18 year old self (a self that was highly influenced by a character she played at that age) and her current self (which she is forced to grapple with while preparing to play another older character from the same play that made her famous so many years ago). Maria's biggest problem however may not be her inability to see either her younger or current self clearly but her complete inability (caused and/or aggravated by a chronic self-centeredness)  to read (and properly value) other people. Virtually the entire film features Marie and Valentine in various Alpine settings rehearsing for a play that has defined Maria's life far more than she cares to admit.  These scenes between the self-centered Maria and the selfless Valentine and this film is an infinitely rich and ambiguous film that only becomes moreso after one leaves the theatre.",1433289600,36,1839,5.079470198675497

7148609,1,B00WQT3UMI,"Was this movie trying to be a modern-day version or kinda-remake of All About Eve? If so, it totally failed at it.

What was the point of this movie, really? And why was it so LONG? The premise of an older actress being intimidated by a younger one in this case was taken to such an over the top, dragged out, and useless extreme that it made watching this movie feel like a trainwreck and watching paint dry all at once and the same time. It was borderline silly. Overall, pointless. Save yourself time: skip this.",1501545600,,515,4.364583333333333

7148611,5,B00WQT3UMI,"My favorite movie in a long time. The complex, subtle, multilayered relationship between the two central characters (Binoche and Stewart are both marvelous, and Chloe Grace Moretz is terrific in smaller role) is what makes this movie such a beguiling psychological puzzle. It's at times haunting, at times very funny, and consistently fascinating. The ending leaves a lot unstated, making it fun to think about and discuss, but is clear enough (in my opinion, if you've been paying attention and thinking about what the characters represent to each other) to be satisfying. A delicious movie.",1500595200,4,592,5.242105263157895

7148621,5,B00WQT3UMI,"Juliette Binoche is one of my favorite actors and she did not disappoint here.  Kristen Steward was new to me but after watching this movie I watched Cafe Society and Camp X-Ray.  She picks some very good and diverse movies to be in and I think she added more than her fair share of the enjoyment of each movie.
I waited to review this movie until I had seen it a second time as parts of the Steward character were really confusing to me and I thought a second viewing might clear up the disorienting actions of Valentine's departure from the movie.  On first viewing my first reaction was ""I must have missed something"" and my second reaction why did Valentine leave as her character was really important and now there is a big hole in the movie.  Perhaps the character Jo-Ann Ellis tied it all together in her explanation of why she would not and could not look back at Ms. Binoche's character in the play.  It was time to move on and not the time to dwell on the past.  In a sense she was saying different generations just do not mix.
My feeling is that the hole Valentine's departure's created was real and perhaps an all to common occurrence if people do not understand that each generation has its own singularity that is to be embraced and examined.
I would also add the the photography in this movie was outstanding and I thought it was particularly innovative to show vintage film of the clouds.",1488240000,,1404,4.443579766536965

7148624,2,B00WQT3UMI,"I'm halfway through this long film, and deciding whether to continue wasting my time.  I really like Binoche, but this is much too long with literally no plot development aside from the obvious.  Could have been done well in 1.5 hrs. or less.  Stewart is her usual irritating self, playing a role that is probably her everyday personality in real life.  Not sure I can endure another boring hour.  The only thing I enjoyed were the beautiful scenes in Europe.",1487116800,,459,4.6875
7148625,5,B00WQT3UMI,"Very cerebral film about a renowned actress dealing with the passage of time and the cultural obsession with youth. Though the film starts off slowly, the allegories (between the characters in the movie and the ones they portray in the film) slowly unravel themselves in the latter half of the film, a pleasant surprise as it isn't obvious from the beginning.

7148634,2,B00WQT3UMI,"OK, I watched the Criterion Blu-Ray version.  I did not buy it on Amazon.

I appreciate artistic interpretation as much as anyone but this movie was severely disjointed and dragged tremendously.  There is no doubt that the two lead actresses are very good but you have to have a story to tell.

As this dragged on I wondered where it was going and then Val just up and disappears on the hike to see the Molaja Snake.  Really ?  In that sparse country side ?  The interpretation is given by Stewart in the end in the interview supplement and is unacceptable.  Sure, we have the ability to hypothesize why she disappeared but the actual act of vanishing is unrealistic.  Their relationship to this point has been very close and you really think that Maria would not have realized that Val did not talk to her for 10-15 minutes while she chattered on.

And, there is no follow-up on what happened to Val.  Was she eaten by the mountain goat ?

Much better movie for older-younger, mentor-student female acute realization ?  Try ""I've Heard the Mermaids Singing.""",1481587200,,1059,4.629032258064516

Most of this film is spent with her assistant as they practice the lines and live. The acting was pristine. The story was very good, in the sense that it brought emotions and entertainment. It's clever and sweet. The only reason why I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because it felt unfinished. Which was most likely on purpose. But it stopped at such an abrupt and careless time. To stop a film and leave the viewer in aw and curiosity is one thing. To stop a film and leave the viewer confused...(oh did it end?) is another. Regardless, great film.",1478995200,3,683,4.34375

It is about acting (or maybe any creative pursuit), and what acting takes out of a person, and what it costs. . .sometimes it costs the people around the actor.  Sometimes maybe it costs too much?

This is a movie to really think about.  I enjoy a good comic book movie as much as anyone, but this is a movie that asks more of viewers than a couple hours.  Oh, and the acting is top notch.  Stewart knocks it out of the park as Valentine.",1477353600,,612,4.033333333333333
7148642,5,B00WQT3UMI,"This movie is going to be a legendary cult film like ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW in 30 years.
 Just watch this ending of the movie.
[...]
 This is not all serial killer movie of Ryan Reynolds who can hear voices of his pet cat and dog, dead girls whom he killed eventually by accident-actually those who talk has no body but just heads.
 Yes he did killed them all by accident, yes, he called them accident but not sure that they are all accident. But again, this is not a serial killer dark drama.

This is a cult classic that will be talked in 40 years later will be another Rocky Horror Picture show wanna be movie.

Ryan Reynolds is a sick man. He can hear voices and without his medication, he cannot contain normal life. He lives in this abandoned bowling house that he and he only lives.

He works for this company that he does the boxing for big boxes, tapes them. Its a very simple boring job.
 It becomes sick when he has this meeting with a girl from the office at his car at night and accidentally kills her.

Her name is Fiona(Gemma Arterton ). Then he simply cuts off all her parts and put her face inside his refrigerator. Then worse thing happens. She begins to talk. She begin to be his burden.
 Then came the other girl, this time a very nice girl that he doesnt want to let go. Her name is Lisa (Anna Kendrick).
 He did worked pretty hard to protect her but fail to do so.
 Then again in his refrigerator.
 Then this fat girl came, again, you know where. They all talk.
 Then he no more can hide. His colleagues come to search whats going on since people are missing.

His life is about to be in real trouble.
 He goes to his shrink. An old lady. She cannot save him.
 The end is not an unhappy ending and that makes this a true cult film of all cult film.

You will really love it and will probably watch it again at least twice.
 The movie is colorful and pretty original comparing the fact that there is already movies like Dr. Doritle and all.

But this is different. This is not all comedy. It doesnt make you empty laugh.

It is scary sometimes but also make you think.
 When he meet his shrink the last time and she tells him the last advice saying you're not the only one who is alone in this world and he says thats the million dollar advice that you gave me which it better than all the other advices youve gave me so far, all of them together added.

Sometimes honest advice can be helpful then thousand words of doctor like stupid words.
 If you want sometime different, this can be the one.
 Two lovely actors will make you like this movie as well.
 Also all the other characters are doing their jobs perfectly.
 The director Marjane Satrapi came from Iran and she made some great animation back then called Persepolis and few other films.

Of course Juliette can support such great and difficult roles. Stewart does not have the experience to do this yet.

7148655,5,B00WQT3UMI,"This is a great movie. It is quiet and intelligent, and I find myself watching it again and again. It is all about the relationship between the aging actress and the (aging) personal assistant. Both of them are growing up, and, unfortunately, growing apart. I don't fully understand what goes on between them, nor do I understand why or how they see the same thing, differently. If I keep watching, though, I hope to figure that out. If the answers I seek are not in the movie, then, that's OK, too. The adventure is rewarding, either way.
On a totally different level, the movie is fascinating because it is about process, i.e., seeing a work of art from different angles, preparing for a role, talking about its meaning. At least 6 characters have 6 different viewpoints of the play within the movie.
Listening to Ms. Binoche and Ms. Stewart independently tell about their experiences (Special Features) making this movie is almost as interesting as watching them in their roles.

7148657,4,B00WQT3UMI,"This movie is absorbing and very well acted, a bit ""talky,"" but not boring -- and for that the credit goes largely to Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart, for it's the dynamic between their characters that is the main focus of interest.  For all that, it's a bit opaque, in the sense that the central concern is a bit hard to put one's finger on, so what follows are observations of what I found interesting, rather than a very focused critique.  The basic story is that an aging actress, Maria Enders (Binoche) has been asked to play the part of an older woman in a play in which, 20 years earlier, she played the young woman who drove the older woman into obsession and possibly suicide.  Kristen Stewart is Valentine, her personal assistant, who manages her appointments and affairs, but who, unusually, engages with Maria in discussions of the significance of the play and isn't afraid to state her disagreements on points of interpretation.  We know nothing of Valentine's background, but there's a bit of the bright undergraduate English major about her.  The director of the production in which he hopes Maria will take the older woman part is Klaus Diesterweg (Lars Eidlinger) who also takes part in discussions quite intelligently.  For the younger woman in his production he has cast Jo-Ann Ellis (Chloe Grace Moretz), a young star not associated with the theatre and with a tendency, like Lindsey Lohan, to end up looking drunk and disorderly on the front pages of tabloids.  The action mainly takes place in Sils Maria, high up in the Swiss Alps, at a house owned by the widow of the recently-deceased playwright of the play in question.

Time is an obvious motif -- Maria is no longer an ingenue; she's a respected actress, and the past and the future are alluded to in clips from a couple of movies that Maria and Valentine see: one is a 100 year-old movie about the Maloja Snake, a cloud formation in Sils Maria that gives the play its title; the other is a sci-fi techno-fantasy that stars Jo-Ann and gives Maria a chance to see the young woman she'll be working with.  Jo-Ann turns out to be more savvy and self-aware than than we are led to expect -- and by no means stupid.  But she has taken up with an up-and-coming writer (Brady Corbett), whose deserted wife makes a suicide attempt on his taking up with Jo-Ann.  With all this, the tabloid paparazzi are in full cry, and of course are fascinated too by Maria's return to a different role in a play that made her name as a young actress.

Whatever happens in the play -- and we see Maria and Valentine working on scenes -- it becomes clear that in their real-life relationship, the older woman is the stronger; finally what she says, will go, and she isn't tyrannical or ugly about it, but her self-assurance and command make Valentine seem a bit unsubstantial by comparison -- unlike the play, youth here does not have the power to have its way with age, and this is so even despite the fact that Maria is by no means certain that the older woman role is a good fit for her.  Her grasp of the characters and the issues in the play have a kind of concreteness that Valentine's more abstract ""lit-crit"" talk isn't able to shake.  And Valentine, in a striking scene that involves a hike to see the Maloja Snake cloud formation seems to fade like the clouds themselves.  On the other hand, Jo-Ann, the other young woman, has a sense of how SHE wants her role to be -- and she's going to do it, Maria be damned.  In a very nice, brief understated scene, Jo-Ann's insistence and Maria's counter to it are very nicely juxtaposed, and Maria, who can't, and perhaps doesn't want to, demand that on stage she has the last word (which as a real-life employer, she CAN have) accedes: the play, after all, is not just a showcase for a single artist.  The contrast that matters, I think, is that between artists as they relate to artists and artists as they relate to ""ordinary"" folks -- and in relation to Maria -- and Jo-Ann and her writer boyfriend too -- Valentine is ordinary.  She's not the one who creates meaningful and beautiful stage works, and nor is she the one the paparazzi chase.  The relation between art and celebrity -- even serious art and celebrity -- is something that we're aware of, even as, in our mind (as corrective? or as a symbol of the permanent that no longer claims attention?)  the images of the alps and the clouds from both past and present haunt the memory.",1470268800,2,4452,4.548185231539424
7148658,5,B00WQT3UMI,"When I heard that 'Clouds of Sils Maria' was to be seen on the small screen, I jumped at the chance. Juliette Binoche, one of the my favorite actresses plays a famous actress Marie Enders. She and her assistant Kristin Stewart are on their way to Zurich via train to partake in a tribute to Marie's artistic mentor, Wilhelmina Melchoir. On the train they find he has suddenly died, but the tribute will continue. His widow invites them to stay in her house in the Alps.

In the Alps, at Sils Maria, they climb everyday looking for a cloud formation called the Maloja Snake. Marie has been offered a role as a female boss who has an affair with a young woman in the office. Marie had played the young woman, and now is asked to play the older boss. This is where life becomes art, Marie and Val have become lovers, and it is difficult to know at times what is acting and what is real. The young girl is played by a a very manipulative Chole Grace Moretz who wants to find her way stepping over bodies as she rises.

Kristin Stewart shines in the role of Val. Juliette Binoche is as always superb, and as she grows older, the roles she takes are more sophisticated and complex.  Thus is a film that asks to be watched more than once so the subtleties can become pronounced.

7148695,4,B00WQT3UMI,"Admittedly it took me a while to get into this film from Olivier Assayas (Summer Hours) but once settled in, I found myself enjoying a complex and interesting film with some fine performances.  Juliette Binoche (Godzilla) plays an internationally acclaimed actress.  Twenty years earlier she played a young upstart assistant to a female head of a large corporation.  In that story, the two became romantically involved which got in the way of running the company.  Now Maria has been asked to play the older woman in a stage play to be produced in London.  The role she played before would be played by Jo-Ann Ellis (Chloe Grace Moretz, Kick-Ass), an up-and-coming actress who is constantly in the tabloids for some public confrontation or adverse circumstances (think Lindsay Lohan).

Maria has great reservations about doing the role of the older woman but retreats to the Swiss Alps with her personal assistant, Valentine (Kristen Stewart, from the Twilight films) to rehearse the script.  While not overt, there is something in the relationship between the two that mirrors some of the events that take place in the fictional stage-play.  Maria, remains reluctant, but through Valentines coaching continues.  The two take long walks through mountain trails, hoping to see the cloud formation that snakes its way through the canyons created by the mountains.

As Valentine becomes ever more frustrated by Marias disinclination regarding the role, she questions her value toward her employer.  Assayas, working from his own script is in no hurry to get to the final act, and the lead up is a bit of a lurch forward.  Still, the film is a beautiful backdrop, both literally and figuratively for the grand vistas and superior performances.  Stewart in particular appears to have left those stupid Twilight films behind her and shows real heft as an actor.  Be patient and enjoy the ride.",1456272000,,1887,5.064724919093851

She was much more interesting than Kristen Stewart and Juliette Bonoche who's dialogue will put you to sleep.

I don't know if this is real or a fictional cloud formation in the mountains thing, but the fact that watching clouds move is the highlight of a movie, certainly tells you something.

Clouds of Sils Maria is needlessly long, the movie tells us what is going on at the Maloja Snake with about half an hour to go, you've probably already worked that out anyway long before that but granted there's a good chance you probably fell asleep so it's nice that it highlight this for you.

It's slow, massively... massively pretentious and the subject matter is extremely un-interesting and un-engaging.

For audiences who want to get a taster of how insulated life may be for a successful but aging female star who spends too much time with her much younger, and probably slightly brighter, assistant this is an interesting character study. No story here, the film focuses mainly on their work relationship, or other actor related truisms (like who seduced and then dumped the star when she was young, naive and unknown, or the dog eat dog nature of ambitious actors).  Rate it 2 and 1/2 stars rounded up to 3 for superb acting and what felt like an honest representation of an aging star's life. The star/assistant relationship is the film so best to have low expectations story-wise. If approached with no expectation of story, audiences who like character studies or films featuring the actor's life will probably enjoy it.",1448064000,13,923,4.841772151898734

7148803,5,B00WQT3UMI,"Clouds of Sils Maria is a well-acted think piece dealing with fame, aging, and replacement. Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche) is a famous Hollywood actress who began her career playing the nineteen year old lesbian Sigrid in a play-and-film production of Maloja Snake. Now twenty years later, she is asked to play the role of the successful yet lonely and vulnerable older woman, Helena, in the courtship. Cast in the role as young Sigrid is Chloe Grace Moretz, who plays the wild-child rising starlet Jo-Ann Ellis. In the role of Maria Enders personal assistant is Kirsten Stewart as the unhappy, argumentative Valentine. Although the film reported only $1.2 million at the box office, Rotten Tomatoes gave it a high 89% ratingrare for a film they rate. I found the story intriguing, with stellar performances all around. Well worth the rental fee for its beautiful Switzerland scenery alone, I found this film a delightful undertaking for a nice evening to be shared or watched alone (note: one brief nude scene). Kristin Stewarts disappearance from the film while 80% finished stuck in my throat, yet it is typical of her generations penchant for ghosting relationships rather than ending them with closure.

The relationship between Maria and her assistant is intriguing and unfolds amid many other relationships present and past. I still have questions about many things, this is a film that will stay with you and make you think. I loved the commentary about the new age/interenet/scandals etc.  As well as the commentary on the soul destroying viciousness of it all.

Juliette Binoche does the best she can with a flat script. And the ingenue character is just a nightmare. I thought the young menwho appear only brieflywere more entertaining and believable. I hated it. It's not that the film is abstract, as I've loved some very abstract films in the past, like Blue, White, and Red.

This film had the potential of being a tremendous breakthrough for her...  opposite a phenomenal talent, Juliette Binoche, but Kristen was still ""Bella""... even when she put her hair behind her ear.  She can't even smoke a cigarette like a real smoker!  When someone is stressed, annoyed, sad, angry or pissed, he/she takes a whopping drag off of a cigarette and blows out smoke from his/her mouth, nose and ears ;)  if they are portraying a real smoker!

7148849,1,B00WQT3UMI,"Really not a fan. Olivier Assayas's ""Irma Vep"" was transcendent and amazing, and sometimes I feel that it is my favorite movie of all time. However, I get the feeling that that movie was based on improvisation, and that less rigid nature is what made it so incredible. I feel pretty sure that ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" is scripted, so it is too rigid, and the only good thing about ""Irma Vep"" is gone. Lacking great photography, production value, or mise en scene, there is nothing great about this movie, or any other Assayas movies, save ""Irma Vep."" It hurts to say that because ""Vep"" was  so great and even brilliant. However, this movie is a stick in the mud. Kristen Stewart's reluctant energy permeates through her whole role, but while it sunk her role and dragged the movie down a notch, I'm not even sure that the movie would have been any better even with a better actress in her role. Binoche is ok, but certainly doesn't save the movie either.

The movie's fatal flaw is its foundation: its dreadfully boring premise and script, which is almost completely dialogue. The movie is overly complex and tedious, talking about characters that are barely in the movie and seemingly inconsequential. The chattery girl-talk puts your emotions in overdrive, and it is hard to believe that a man directed this. So much of the movie is this hormonal girl-talk and gossip. It amounts to talking about things that happen, but not really seeing anything happen, and it's pretty frustrating. The movie over-philosohpizes about a play we never really see, except for a few seconds at the end.

I suppose this movie has a central theme (aging), but it skips around something fierce. That loose energy could be interesting if we had the feeling of ""Irma Vep,"" but we don't. At the end of the day, this movie is something drowning at sea, and nothing really saves it. If you want to see a piece of brilliance, see ""Irma Vep,"" that is brilliant, and everything that makes French cinema great, and everything that this movie is trying to be. The same could be said of ""Ponette,"" and ""Force Majeur."" Those are all incredible French movies, and I recommend you see them instead. ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" is too meticulous, and belabors an uninteresting point: an actress preparing for a role, and the fear that she is a has-been. What is supposed to be so interesting about this movie are the philosophical points of practicing for a role, but it is way too dry. The majority of the plot focuses on a play and events that happen off screen, and it makes the action as dry as sand. This movie also features women acting crazy together, which if you're a guy, really doesn't speak to you. However, even if you're a woman, I don't think you'll like this movie either. I hate giving Olivier Assayas less than 5 stars, but that is really what this movie deserves. I give it 1.5 stars. When a movie is so creative and not just a brainless action explosion-fest, I really want to give it 5 stars, or at least make it clear that it is on another level than an action movie that I'd give the same rating to. But I also have to be clear in that this movie achieved none of its goals. Don't get me wrong, ""Godzilla"" was totally brainless, and although I gave it more stars than this, it is down on some dumber level in which it achieved more stars in its attempt to do what it was trying to do: simply entertain the audience with explosions. Kudos to Assayas for trying something more creative than what you see at the MegaPlex, but this movie didn't hit its own marks.",1440115200,4,3541,4.547021943573668
7148850,5,B00WQT3UMI,"Powered by two towering performances by Juliette Bincoche and Kristen Stewart, Assayas tells the story of a complex and fragile relationship between an older (as in late 40s) actress and movie star. and her young assistant.  But instead of getting an art film variation on All About Eve (and there are echoes of that classic) we get something much richer, more subtle and enigmatic about aging, art, acting, identity, youth and the complexity of relationships between women, and between employer and employee.  (Its also all spectacularly well photographed).

Maria (Binoche) is a respected and admired film star going to a festival to honor the writer-director who launched her career years earlier, casting her in a piece examining the relationship between an aggressive young woman and an older female boss who falls for her.  But the mentor dies before the festival can start, and the shaken Maria is talked into returning to the seminal project of her career, but now in a London stage production where she will play the older woman, not the younger.  This triggers all sorts of complex fears and emotions, so Maria retreats to the incredibly beautiful mountain home of her now dead mentor, bringing her young assistant Valentine (Stewart) with her to help her study and analyze the role.  In the process the two women grow closer, and share much about themselves and their world views, each challenging, supporting and at times frightening or enraging the other.

The film boldly embraces the meta nature of the tale  the relationship in the film in many ways  but far from all  mirroring the key relationship in the play.  While rooted in naturalism, there is a spooky sense of ambiguity always creeping around the edges of the film, the sense that anything could happen, and in the end, nothing is tied together with a neat bow.  Thankfully! There are still questions and mysteries to be pondered.

The film did have a few miss-steps for me on a first viewing, some late turns that felt more forced than what preceded it, but but those 'problems' bothered me less a second time around.  That's happened to me before with Assayas, as with Bergman and other film makers who deal as much with the mystery of human behavior as with the mechanics of plot.  And the tremendously dense work between Bincoche and Stewart is wonderful.  There is a sense of freedom in the performances, a wonderful immediacy as the two bounce off each other like ping-pong balls, that gives a sense that much of what we're seeing is semi-improvised (though I highly doubt that was actually the case).  Seeing that loose, playful, alive style in a film that on a larger level is much more formal in its structure and ideas creates a wonderful friction that also gives the film a terrific sense of life.  And life - and the way we change as we move through is - is ultimately what the film is all about.",1440028800,,2883,4.78989898989899

7148879,5,B00WQT3UMI,"If you missed CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA when it was released in April, it may be just what you need to keep the dog days at bayand not only because the films locations primarily include a cozy chalet and the mountains, forested valleys, and high meadow vistas of the Alps in southeastern Switzerland. Lead actors Juliet Bincohe and Kristen Stewart give invigoratingly intelligent performances, and Olivier Assayas directs his own screenplay with shrewd grace. Assayas 2008 film, SUMMER HOURS, won the New York, Boston, Vancouver, Los Angeles, and National Society of Film Critics Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. Among other works he also directed 1996s IRMA VEP. We watched CLOUDS OF SILS MARIAwhich is largely in English with a few subtitles here and therelast night and found ourselves talking about it both as we headed off to bed and almost as soon as we were up this morning. How often do we see films that are psychologically engaging and emotionally affecting, that unfold like dreams with our never knowingat every single step of the way what will happen next, and that rigorously refuse to insult our intelligence?

The film picks up with Maria Enders (Binoche), a celebrated screen and stage actor, on a train to Zurich to deliver a tribute to a playwright named Wilhelm Melchior. Accompanied by a canny personal assistant, Valentine (Stewart), they receive news enroute that Melchior has died. The tribute goes ahead, and afterward the two women meet with his widow at her house in the Swiss mountains. Years before, Melchior wrote a play, Maloja Snake, about a female corporate boss who has an affair with a young woman in her officeoriginally played by Maria. Now she has been asked to revisit the work, on the London stage, in the role of the older woman. And sostaying at the Melchior chalet while the widow is awayMaria runs lines with Valentine reading Marias former part in Melchiors home.

The viewer is invited to explore the indistinct and porous borders of art and lifeand the unique artfulness of those actors who live even closer to those fault lines than others of their peersbut Assayas, Bincohe, and Stewart refrain from allowing the meta framing to become precious, archly intrusive, or self-conscious. The viewer is pleasurably seduced into a mystery that is heady, unpredictable, slightly disorienting, and provocative. CLOUDS OF SILA MARIA is both rich and fresh, and even an unresolved development near the end proves to be neither careless nor contrived but stimulating and, in retrospect, expansive.

As Maria confronts her insecurities about playing the older character in the playand eventually meets the young Hollywood celebrity (Chloe Grace Moretz) who will take her former, career-making role as the manipulative 20-something seductressthe interplay between life and art burgeons with more force in Maria and Vals relationship. As they take long hikes and bathe in alpine tarns, we are drawn even more deeply into the film by the necessity of trying to discern line rehearsals from personal exchanges. Binoche (who appeared onstage in London earlier this year in Antigone) gives one of her most raw-boned and arresting screen performances to date, and Stewart meets her more than halfwayshe need not worry about her career lingering in the penumbra of TWILIGHT. (Both won Frances Cesar Awards for their performances this year, as did Assayas for his screenplay.)

The house and its pristine yet ethereal setting offer the films meditations an added redolence. Now a museum and study center, it was home to Friedrich Nietzsche during several productive summers. He wrote of it, Here one can live well, in this strong, bright atmosphere, here where nature is amazingly mild and solemn and mysterious all at once, he wrote. Assayas powerfully evokes this atmosphere for his film. Here is the true high life, one that calls into question the model in which Maria and her kindand not only in the movie businessare so often consumed.
Not only does CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA invite repeat viewings, I anticipate that it will reward them.",1439164800,7,4067,5.074738415545591

I know an Arizona rube like me ain't near smart enough to appreciate the high intellectual standards of a fine Franco/German/Swiss-production, but for even for the smarter set, this movie has to be an insult. What a waste of Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart's fine talents on a tale so badly told that the best scenes in the movie will simply make great screensaver shots for someone's computer.

Let me summarize the movie for you so you don't have to rent it. A actress (Binoche) once played a stage role to great acclaim. Now, twenty years later, the director of that play wants her to do the same play, but now cast in the role of the older woman. Her former role has been given to a rascal, who in real life, has some sort of Lindsey Lohan thing going back in the States. Aboard a first-class train on her way to Zurich, she learns that the director has croaked. There is great angst among the intellectual class in Zurich when she arrives. They spend hours mourning and reflecting on this fine man. At least, it seems like hours.

Meantime, Juliet is suffering from another sort of pain and yearning. She wants to do the play. Then, she doesn't. Then, she does. Oh, and she hates her former male co-star, but has drinks with him and gives him her hotel room number. The sexual tension is almost, unbearable.

The adorable Stewart is Juliette's put-upon assistant who juggles three cell phones with calls from every continent and then spends the rest of the time running five paces behind Juliet as they rehearse lines. The remainder of the movie alternates between Juliette's posh Swish chalet and long and languid walks around the Swiss Alps. They walk. They talk. We watch them sleep on the ground. Fade to black. A quick dip in a lake. There is some sort of weather phenomenon that sends clouds in to the valley. I think it's called fog, but everyone is agog at the apparition. Fade to black. More talk. More walk. Near the end of the film, In one amazing scene, Stewart simply disappears from the Alps as if she was abducted by aliens. She never appears again in the film. Und so weiter. Und so weiter.

Juliette finally decides to do the play. The set is gorgeous. It must have blown half the film's budget. But we will never know because we don't get to see any part of the play. It's opening night. Juliette takes a pull on a cigarette. She walks on stage. A quick check of script and she's ready to go. Lights up. Audience is buzzing. Everyone ready? Great. Then, why don't we fade to black and roll the credits.

Binoche and Stewart did their level best to prop up this movie, but it wasn't nearly enough. I think something called story is also required. From my Lazyboy, give me a subtitled Grard Depardieu movie anytime.",1438992000,14,2762,4.527054108216433

7148902,5,B00WQT3UMI,"Too slow; too talky - yes, because it requires some focus as to what is happening in this story of an aging actress trying to embrace the emotional insight that comes with acting in a proposed sequel movie based upon an older acclaimed film in which she played a young companion to an older woman and a role that made her famous. But, as she's now decades aged, she now takes on the role of the original film's older companion.
Another theme, again my interpretation, is that while she prepares for this sequel with her assistant it seems that we have a movie within a movie that parallels that original movie's storyline i.e. her relationship with her current assistant is becoming more and more like that movie.
Yes, I'm trying to offer guidance with just a few words so don't expect step by step clarity. So with that thought, it's not clear if her assistant is real or imaginary or if the replacement is real or imaginary or if they are the same person (real & imaginary). You'll see!

OK, let's try highlights of the film.
1. The Maloja Snake, which is a common cloud forming process in valleys, but particularly impressive within the backdrop of the Alps. Symbolically, in the film, it could be impending problems.
2. The acting in this film was quite good (Kudos to Binoche, Stewart), and additionally the actors preparing (and self reflection) for acting was insightful.
3. The many ttettes between Binoche and Stewart. Liked their dissing of bimbo roles for women; stupid characters mouthing generic pop psych.
4. The dialogue and role playing e.g. Chlo Grace lines and behavior in an interview session was outrageously funny. That was worth the film in itself.",1438473600,,1670,4.758620689655173

So let me say that this is not an ""All About Eve"" storyline, though it is equally as committed to its characters.  It is not dramatic.  Some of the play-in-a-play reading sound pretentious.  There is definitely a European feel to the film.  Why do I feel this is a 5 star film, and Birdman a 1 star film?

The more I think about Birdman, the cheaper the after-taste.  Clouds of Sils Maria ages well in my head.  The more I think about the film, the more I get out of it.

One of the themes the film explores is the meaning of Art to each of us.  The Stewart character is a lost, unhappy girl, with few friends who should be any Artist's best friend.  She is smart, open-minded, generous.  What does she find, when she works for one of the most successful actresses (in the film)?  As mature and experienced as Binoche is, how deep is she really?  (I'm talking about the character of course).

In the end, all art is private to each of us, and in a way, sad, because it isn't strong enough to make real-life bonds.  The film is a beautiful character-study.  I wouldn't call it an ""entertainment"".  But I'll watch it again.",1437955200,4,1191,4.360730593607306

7148939,4,B00WQT3UMI,"""Clouds of Sils Maria"" is an intelligent, energetic, often beautiful, and extremely well-made film that explores a couple of salient themes: the nature of the show business/art world and the inevitable emotions of aging. Being the story of an aging actress, it combines these themes seamlessly, being, in part, about the way the entertainment industry views and treats older actresses. But the movie is also relatable for the common viewer, with the show business/art world serving as a stand-in of sorts for any of many insular, evolving worlds, and the conflict that Maria Enders endures just one more example of a person facing the trials of growing older. As theoretical as this sounds, the movie is also ultimately a character study of Maria, and is anchored by a bravura performance by Juliette Binoche. (Binoche fans should rejoice!) Kristen Stewart is good as Val, Maria's personal assistant, and, to a large degree through Val, the movie offers an especially convincing portrait of the life of a famous, successful actress: the travel, the decisions, the work, the relationships, the imperatives of the industry and personal choice, etc. Though it arguably goes a bit far in its meta/play-within-a-play nature (Maria and Val rehearse line readings from a play that essentially mirrors their own relationship), it also keeps you guessing about who precisely Maria is, as well as about the nature of her values, and whether or not she can transition into her more ""mature"" stage with her grace, dignity, and integrity intact. The movie is arguably slightly marred by making its symbol of youth a somewhat cartoonish, media-hungry young Hollywood starlet (Chloe Grace Moretz), but it also wishes to explore precisely the relationship between art and entertainment/commerce, and hovers around various positions between those (apparent) poles. Ultimately, this is a sophisticated and thoughtful exploration of one person trying to find her place in the complicated world as she grows older and adapts  or not  to an ever-changing life.

8713941,5,B00WQT3UMI,"OMG!!!-- The Amazing Ms. Juliet Binoche has performed an absolute Masterpiece! The entire movie is filled with exceptional acting also by Kristen Stewart (perfection!) and the other key players- Klaus and Joann (Chloe Moritz).

From beginning to end, the plot unfolds like a delicious novel one cannot put down or look away from. Partially set in Switzerland, the landscape is supremely lush and breathtaking. This movie is like a sensory vacation to one of the most beautiful places in earth.
When the movie opens there is a tension between the Assistant (Stewart) and the Actress Maria (Binoche), that one senses but isn't quite sure of. Stewart is working so hard and Binoche is kind of absorbing her and not really listening to her. It takes a toll on Stewart who tries so hard to hide it. Their relationship is very productive like a fine working team. They are unstoppable. Stewart is smart and helps Binoche choose the best roles and knows Binoche and how to handle her. But as time goes on we see just how hard Stewart has to work to stay in constant enthrall of Binoche and she just can't take it anymore. Juliet Binoche is an absolute powerhouse. Stewart though has got to get out to save herself because she is disappearing inside Binoche's shadow.
Every single scene of this movie is sheer perfection.

The blessing of a great European film is that it takes its time. The story unfolds naturally and is unhurried. This allows for actual understanding of the characters and plot. I cannot say enough good things about this film. The dialogue is just too good.

The musical score as well, so gorgeously set to the timing of the scenes. The Pachelbel Canon drops in at exactly the perfect moment. The first time, is a big surprise. And goes so well with the ache and passion of loss. Binoche's character stays so hidden up inside of herself as she refuses to acknowledge the enormous blow of losing Stewart; her loss is then slowly unfolding inside of Binoche as she goes on and see's for herself just how great of a gift Stewart was to her. Oh she see's this very clearly.

And then there is the rolling across the waves, towards the up and coming Chloe Moritz who has absolutely no conscience whatsoever and who just ploughs over Binoche like a steamroller who kind of sits smack dab in the trajectory of Moritz's path. Binoche can see her coming for her. Tries to get out of the play. It becomes too late and she is trapped. Stewart is long gone by this point. Any weaker character would have crumpled. Not the Amazing Ms. Juliet Binoche. Not a chance. And then, the young director turns his spotlight on the older Ms. Binoche, just as Moritz has decimated her; and he turns to her as everyone else has fast forwarded to Moritz, and he says, no, not her. He wants Binoche for her timelessness. Which truly is exactly what Juliet Binoche is in entirety; ageless, strength of beauty and wisdom. A pure professional who shall not be unseated. Cue the strings.

8713946,4,B00WQT3UMI,"A ""play"" within a ""play"" where often the two intersect.  Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche) is asked to perform a revival of the play that made her famous twenty years before.  This time, however, she is asked to play the older woman rather than the ingenue.  With the help of her assistant (Kristen Stewart), she fights this change in role but faces the reality that it is no longer appropriate for her to play the same role she previously played. The young woman who plays the role Enders made famous provides an unsettling force of youth vs. age.

While acting is uniformly wonderful Kristen Stewart in particular is a revelation.  Her role stretches her abilities as an actress and she impressively measures up to the task.  If an excellent plot and acting weren't enough, the photography is awe-inspiring.",1509753600,,807,4.854014598540146
