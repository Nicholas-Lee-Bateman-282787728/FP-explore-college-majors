This was directed by Bruce Li which can be seen from the onset.  Oh, you can also see where Jackie Chan got inspiration for the playground fight in Police Story 2. Jackie saw this film and said, ""The Bruce Li playground fighting scenes are really good""
Funny stuff: Bruce electrocuting a nosy thug, deadly doll, secret codes, funniest 70s dub music in the club scene, cutie gal who doesn't fall for ""experts"", fake retractable knife, Bruce sparring to ""Pick up the Pieces""

For a good Bruce Li flick , look you got one right here",1525651200,,582,4.533333333333333

Which is the rub really, there are times when you see a film so bad that it becomes a sort of benchmark in your memory, a yardstick against which youll compare all other movies and that also becomes somewhat of a cult talking point. This is just plain terrible. With no quirky or cult status redeeming qualities.

Basically the plot is horrendous and not explained much at all. The blurb on my copy says that one guy is an undercover police officer trying to infiltrate the crime lord guys place. And does so on the grounds that he is hired as an expert in electronic surveillance and the bad guy wants his mansion sorted with a good security system. Via various unexplained and convoluted twists a range of different factions become embroiled in a fight for  well the audience is never given any reason to care what they are fighting over. But it boils down to a bit of a last man standing final fight (after an obligatory number of fights earlier in the film).

There are a couple of half decent fight scenes it must be said  so the film does earn the solitary star Ive given it. The acting is as terrible as youd imagine, the good guy and the bad guys daughter sparking an interest in each other is so poorly done but the lass does have a teddy bear that shoots darts out of the top of its head. So, you know, she isn't all bad as a character.

Cinematography is poor and grainy as youd anticipate, the 70s clothes produce a bit of a smirk and a couple the lines are so corny youll get a second smirk out of the film. My copy has no subtitles, only the English overdub.

And thats it. A couple of half decent fight scenes you don't care about, a teddy bear that shoots darts and two smirks. One star is sufficient.",1456185600,,1791,4.299703264094956

7937767,2,B00005BJWG,"A COP [BRUCE LI] IS AFTER A LIST OF GANG MEMBERS, LITTLE KNOWING THAT 2 GANGS ARE ALSO AFTER THE LIST. HAS A FEW GOOD FIGHT SCENES, BUT THE STORY'S EXTREMELY INCOHERENT AND THE FILM MIGHT AS WELL BE PLOTLESS. FILMMAKERS OF MARTIAL ARTS FILMS MUST'VE BEEN REALLY DESPERATE FOR MONEY, JUDGING FROM ALL THE 1970S AND EARLY-1980S MARTIAL ARTS FILMS I'VE SEEN THAT HAD BRUCE LEE'S NAME IN ITS TITLE. BRUCE LI IS IN GOOD FORM, BUT LET'S FACE IT, HE'S NOT BRUCE LEE AND HE NEVER WILL BE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD MARTIAL ARTS FILM, LOOK ELSEWHERE.",1109548800,,544,4.396039603960396
7937768,3,B00005BJWG,"This flick is one of the many Bruce Li's movies that were commercialy sold with the Bruce Lee name on it. He is the star and director in this movie. Even though he is not at the level of Bruce Lee, he is still is a very worthy martial arts fighter in his own right.
Bruce Li stars as an undercover interpol agent posing as an electronics security systems expert, who is after a triad list of gang members possesed by a Mr. Lo, a known crime boss. Two gangs are also after the list. Mr. Lo has a pretty daughter, who developes a crush on Li. Another man, posing as a member of one of the gangs is actually another Interpol agent, unknown to Li. There are plenty of fights, including one at a carnival and another at a brick factory. At the climax, another martial artist (actor Lo Lieh, who plays a bit part in the beggining of the movie as a bodyguard for Mr. Lo) go against Li and the other Interpol agent. He has a dummy gloved hand attached with a chain, which he swings around! That's pretty hilarious! Anyway, the movie finishes when Li and the other agent fight the remaining leader of one of the gangs, and arrest him.
This movie is quite old (around 1978, even though the DVD box claims it's from 1986). It has a lot of lints and scratches, which are common in low budget kung-fu movies of this era, and it has no relevant features. I would surely appreciated if Platinum Disc Corporation remastered their DVD catalog. But even as it is, the movie is still watchable.
I definitly would not rate this movie as an all-time classic, but still this flick is good if you plan to stay home on a saturday evening. Recommended if you're a fan of Bruce Li's movies.",1034121600,2,1664,4.302547770700637
7937769,2,B00005BJWG,"A very blatant attempt to milk the Bruce Lee legend and cash-cow for all it was worth, and spawned a legion of lookalike wanna-be's with soundalike names, such as Bruce Li and Bruce Le, et al. As you might expect, the results are less than favorable, and although Bruce Li does have a little more than a passing physical resemblance to Lee, that's where the similarities end; Li's fight choreography is nowhere near Lee's; not even in the same ballpark. Oddly enough, there is even a blond Caucasian actor who takes a stab (literally) at trying to be Chuck Norris, but again, to no avail.
The cinematography in this film is pathetic (much of the time, the actor's faces are halfway out of frame; it might have benefitted more from a widescreen presentation); and the dialogue is horrendously cheesy, with many of the typical ""that's what you think"" and ""damn you, I'll kill you!"" lines coming up often.
Stick to the real McCoy; this is one time where imitation is not the most sincerest form of flattery.",1017705600,2,1004,4.677966101694915
