By the looks of it, no one will ever see these comments. But hey, this movie has a great name! What a poignant flavor ""limehouse"" has! The juxtaposition of ""lime"" and ""blues"" gives a great image! I recommend this movie on that basis alone. I think you'll find if you watch this movie, that the name has great significance. I'm not going to shower you with plot details (this being a crime movie, almost anything I say would spoil some surprises) but go ahead and check this one out if you can find it. Four stars for LIMEHOUSE BLUES!

PS. The artwork for this ""DVD"" looks ridiculous, like it's meant for the Kid's Club YMCA Reader's Corner held at Red Lobster. I'm not sure that this is a real product of Paramount Pictures. I've contacted the Estate of George Raft about the matter and am waiting response. It should not take more that 17 business days.
