2823367,5,B000PHX4EM,We discovered signing time via the public library just before our daughter turned two and now that she's almost three and a half we're so glad to have bought signing time.  She LOVES signing with Alex and Leah.  The videos are both fun and educational and I highly recommend them to parents of hearing children like ours.,1374796800,,321,4.614035087719298
2823368,5,B000PHX4EM,"I love the signing time dvd's. My granddaughter knew over 200 words when she was 18 mo old. She also learned numbers, letters and colors.",1372809600,,137,4.52
2823369,5,B000PHX4EM,"She says please and thank you, and the signs that go with them.  It's really enhanced her communication skills.  Plus she loves to dance to the songs!",1368144000,,150,4.518518518518518
2823370,5,B000PHX4EM,"These are really well done! I read all the raving reviews before I purchased mine, and I agree with all the positive comments. The kids (4,5 & 6) love them, even though I initially purchased them to learn signing with my 8 mos old. It's so nice to have something so educational & entertaining for our kids to view!",1364169600,,314,4.338983050847458
2823371,5,B000PHX4EM,"My 3 year old is speech delayed and these have been very helpful. He watches them repeatedly and learns the signs as he goes. My husband, older son, and I also all watch so we can have a common language with our hearing/non-speaking son. They are a real gift.",1354060800,,259,4.3061224489795915
2823372,5,B000PHX4EM,"My brother is a sign language interpreter who studied the positive effects of babies learning basic signs.  Studies show how it helps with early communication, leading to early speaking & understanding, vocabulary building, reducing tantrums, improving test scores in the future, and more.  This series is fantastic (as is evidenced from all the awards it received), and from just a few weeks of age, our little one was addicted to watching and learning.  Not only was it helpful for basic communication such as letting us know she wanted milk, but she was so mesmerized by the sights and sounds that we could strap her in her stroller, hit play, and have a few minutes to get things done around the house knowing that she was perfectly content.  It even became the way she would be lulled to sleep, thanks to the repeat mode.  By about 18 months of age she knew every sign in the series.

Thanks to my brother for knowing about this and giving us this great gift.  Despite not marketing much to the general public, I think this is something every baby should experience.  I hope there will be a Series 3 sometime...or even just more signs for those hungry for more!",1329696000,6,1166,4.6536585365853655
2823373,5,B000PHX4EM,"I wish I could take the time to review each individual dvd, and eventually, I want to do that, but I wanted to write my overall thoughts here.

I love this product.  I've just been introduced to signing time about a month ago, and as an 38 year old mom of 7 learning asl,  I have found them invaluable to me and my children.  I've checked into the other children's sign language products out there, (after seeing Signing Time),  and these by far exceeds them all.  Rachel is beautiful.  Not because of her looks, (though that too), but her spirit and life she puts into this product.  How she speaks to the audience.  Her explanation of the signs are excellent.  The songs, performance of the songs, etc... are superb.  I can't say enough.  Alex and Leah and Lucy are adorable, as are all of the children that participate.

I started watching the videos ""out of order"", so we were all in love with them by the time we got to see dvds 1-3 in Series 1.  I love these too.  No, the ""entertainment"" is not what the following dvds offer, but she was just getting started, they were feeling their way around, and seeing what they wanted to do, if they were going to continue, etc.. This series started out for her family and friends, after all. I still think volumes 1-3 in series 1 are better than other sign language dvds from other sources.  Yes, Rachel seems shy in front of the camera in the first three, and doesn't talk as much, but the signs, information, and children are of good quality.

As far as the comments about Series 2 not having as many songs.  I feel that Rachel went above and beyond with the songs and performances in the first Series.  It takes lots of effort and talent to write these songs, and come up with the program.  I think the format in the second series, though different than the first, is still of the same great quality that we've come to expect from Signing time.

As far as price.  I think they are a worthwhile investment.  If it looks like a lot to buy the bundle all at once, and if you can't afford that, nickle and dime it a few at a time.  Again looking around at other products, whose quality is not as great, the prices are the same as an individual price in the Signing Time Series.

I love the flash cards, bright colors, clear explanations and pictures of Rachel signing the signs. I haven't seen the books yet.

I am in no way affiliated with Signing Time, (though I do plan to join the Academy soon), I don't know Rachel personally, I'm an average consumer.

I feel Rachel's story is touching, what she has experienced with Leah and Lucy, and I know it's not any more unique in countless other stories, but as a Christian, I must say,  I think God gave Rachel Coleman special blessings of talent, (before motherhood)and special blessings in her girls.  What she had done with Signing Time is an excellent contribution to all who come in contact with it.

The whole team deserves props, her sister is also a talented writer/creator, and her father's music...

Thank you Signing time for opening the world to asl communication for us.  These vocabulary cds, will wet your appetite for learning more of this beautiful language.",1323129600,3,3169,4.466898954703833
2823374,5,B000PHX4EM,I run a daycare out of my home with ages 2-3. My kids absolutely loves watching it. We watch one DVD every morning and they want to watch more throughout the day. They even use ASL during the day. This is a great investment.,1188086400,12,224,4.113636363636363
2823375,5,B000PHX4EM,"Signing Time is an incredible way to teach sign language to your child(ren), yourself, and any adults that interact with your child!!  We began teaching our (hearing) daughter sign language (American Sign Language, or ASL) from birth, and she started signing back around 5 months.  If you are starting with an infant, definitely check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Signing-Time-Volumes-1-2-Plus-2-Music-Cds/dp/B000GHIVNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby Signing Time Volumes 1 & 2 Plus 2 Music Cds</a>&nbsp;too.

For the kids: Signing Time teaches sign language, of course.  But a surprise bonus is that, because the words are displayed on-screen too, many kiddos learn to sign-read the words being taught too!!  Our daughter already knows her ASL-based alphabet, and we use that for prompting when she gets her b-p-q-d mixed up.  Signing Time is engaging for kids of all abilities (Downs Syndrome / T21, Autistic, Deaf) as well.  A friend's darling son who happens to have Down Syndrome is reading ahead of his peers -- that one floored me!

By the way, Signing Time offers board books, such as:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Signing-Time-Board-Book-Vol-1-My-First-Signs/dp/1933543000/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Signing Time!

2823376,5,B000PHX4EM,"This is fantastic and a newer version is already available but these will always be used! The pace and fun style is second to none! My son has a blast without knowing that he is learning a second language, and my wife and i have used this many times (hand signals when you are at a party or help those when at a social event). i cant recommend it enough. the shipper was fast and efficient so top markings",1394150400,,405,4.139240506329114
2823377,5,B000PHX4EM,"I tried teaching my twin girls ASL signs using materials from the Baby Signs company. This didn't work too well for us because the signs were taught in isolation, and we often didn't have the opportunity to use the signs in everyday life. So, I purchased the Signing Times DVDs to see if exposure to the sign in context on the videos would help. Within a week, my 12 month olds were using a dozen signs. Now, three months later, they have upwards of 50 signs. They absolutely love the videos!  They can now express their wants and needs, and no longer get frustrated. They also seem to love books more because they can sign the name for pictures they see. This is a great program and, in my opinion, well worth the price.",1392076800,,721,4.380597014925373
2823378,5,B000PHX4EM,"We started watching this series when we checked out Volume 1 at our local library. Since that day we have been saving up to purchase the entire series. We watch Signing Time on a daily basis. It has opened new doors of communication for our 17 month old. She signs all the time, including colors and numbers. I am amazed by this series and how much she remembers. She watches one video each time I have to go to work that is 4/5 times per week and we have seen her vocabulary blossom. The awesome part is most of the time she signs and says the word that she is using.

She started signing after the first time she viewed this series. There are a number of different videos each with their own theme and my little one loves all of the songs in them. Baby Signing Time is all songs and when she was younger she preferred these but she still loves this series. In fact when she hears ""Hi, I'm Rachel"" she runs toward the TV.

I highly recommend this series to any parent interested in communicating better with your little one. Fits are rare at our house as our little one can now express to us what she could not before.",1391212800,,1119,4.224299065420561
2823379,5,B000PHX4EM,"This has been very developmental for my daughter. She knows all of the signs in these DVDs, even though she is olny allowed to watch once per day.

It is at a level that is eductaional, but not mind numbing.

Love it!",1387584000,,217,4.142857142857143
2823380,5,B000PHX4EM,"My oldest is 2 year old. She is in true love with these DVDs she asked to watch them literally every single day. We don't want her watching shows every day but when we do she jumps up and down and runs to the couch, singing along with the songs. We also got all the baby signing time DVDs and she loves them ALL! So do I. I have taken 2 sign language classes and teach her ASL every day she knows at least 100 signs just from everyday signs. I hope all my children will love sign as much as her. She also loves the CDs, each time we turn off the car she cries because we wants to keep listening to Alex and Leah. See even asks for specific ""Alex and Leah"" songs to be sung as she goes to sleep, it's pretty cute! It's worth every penny spent I love watching her love grow for sign language and hope she uses it all her life.",1386115200,,824,3.9107142857142856
2823381,5,B000PHX4EM,"I have a childcare learning center.  I wanted our children to learn sign language beyond just the alphabet.  To try this out, I checked out a couple of DVD's from the library to review with my pre-k teacher.  Upon her approval and the recommendation of another one of our teacher's, who does sign fluently, I purchased the entire set.  The children love it!  It is very interactive, captivating, and gives them quite the sense of accomplishment!  The director was doing a class observation during a session and was very impressed about how receptive the children were.  Keep up the good work!  We'd also like to see spanish incorporated into the complete set.",1385424000,,659,4.821428571428571
2823382,5,B000PHX4EM,"My 21 months old daughter loves them!

At first I bought just  #1 to try it and keep her busy while preparing our meals. We do not let her watch regular TV, so if she was going to watch TV, I was looking for something that would encourage her to join in and learn something. We got ""My Baby Can Read"" from friends when she was little and she liked to watch it, but then she got bored as she watched it for a half year (5 DVDs). I wanted something similar. We tried #1 and she absolutely loved it. And I have learnt signs with her.  Seeing her singing, jumping and moving her hands and fingers helped me to decide to buy whole set that was not cheap by any means.

Two months later and we are on #5 DVD.  Every two weeks we put in a new DVD and repeat the old ones. She remembers each DVD number by certain sign (i.e. #4 is Family and her favorite is ""uncle""). She will tell me ""uncle"" and I know she wants to watch #4. Every time she watches new DVD she sits still whole time and just watches. It is rare. She is very active baby. As she watches it second and third time she becomes more active and dances with songs and tries to sign. I put a mirror in our living room, so she can watch herself doing the signs and she really likes it.

#1 does not have too many signs, but the way it is made helps to learn them very easy. Other #s have more signs but still not too many to overwhelm baby. At the beginning I also bought ""Baby See N Sign Vol. 1"" that has more signs. But our baby did not last watching it, it did not invite her to ""play"" as much as Signing Time. It also helps that the signs at Signing Time are shown by more kids, so you can see differences in each person's interpretation.

My baby is learning something new and useful, running outside and singing ""signing time with Alex and Leah, come and play!"". I am learning something new. The DVD is great for our portable DVD player when we travel since she does not like to be in a car seat. Or we just keep her busy asking her to show us the signs she knows. I believe it will keep her busy for a long, long time :)",1384732800,,2078,3.980769230769231
2823383,5,B000PHX4EM,"My toddler loves this series.  He has been signing for months now.  And while he is starting to use the spoken word now too, it has been a great assistance with communication in the transition period.

2823385,5,B000PHX4EM,These are fun and very easy to learn. I never thought I could learn so much so fast. I highly recommend these to everyone even if they do not have a special needs child. Great for anyone who wants to learn sign language.,1375660800,,220,4.1395348837209305
8191706,5,B000PHX4EM,"Donated to the library when we were done.

8191710,5,B000PHX4EM,"Expensive! I couldn't find it cheaper anywhere. My niece loves this show, it is the only one she would watch before age 2. At 2.5 she still loves it but will also watch other shows.

Both of my grandchildren are 21 months old and are starting to talk.  With signing time both of them sit and watch the DVD's for a long time.  They are signing and saying the word at the same time.
