8267162,1,B000OYNWDO,"Ok I checked out both offense and defense dvds at my local libarary. sigi schmid is mls coach of the year and won the cup with the crew in 2008 but these dvds don't live up to his name. The offense dvd is horrible, I learned nothing from it. Ok, well I did learn one thing from the offense dvd..""if you are going to miss a pass miss it far like that the other team cant counter"".. The defense dvd was a little better but still the same thing drills drills and drills. Don't excpect to learn how to trap, dribble, pass, and shoot the ball. Forget about learning to curve and what not. All these dvds do is give you like 5 or more training drills that are pretty much dull that you can prob get from the internet. If I were to spend money id prob do it on another product...maybe blast the ball , I don't know. If you know any products that are good or maybe better or similar to blast the ball shoot me an email at rickalex21@gmail.com subject ""sigi schmid dvd review"". Thanks, I like to leave reviews because I know other people do the same for products that im thinking about buying and Im paying it forward.",1246147200,2,1109,4.186915887850467
