8016673,3,B0001VEMNY,"While these classic Harmon-Ising cartoons are not of the caliber of Disney, Looney Tunes, or Max Fleischer they are still worth getting if you love classic animation.  Even in this age of DVD collecting, this VHS tape is a must-have as these are not available on DVD or Laserdisc!

TRT is only 35 minutes.

Bah Wilderness, (Barney Bear) (1943)  NOT ON DVD OR LASERDISC (as of 2007)!

Puppies were popular at this time, even Warner Brothers tried a series of them, possibly due to Disney's popular Kittens Silly Symphony Cartoons.  This is however one of the weaker cartoons on this tape.  NOT ON DVD OR LASERDISC (as of 2007)!

The Tree Surgeon (1944) (George Gordon) In a time at MGM when Tom & Jerry ruled & Tex Avery was making audiences burst at the seams,  George Gordon was assigned to direct this stand-alone cartoon that harked back to the Harmon-Ising days of MGM cartoons.  NOT ON DVD OR LASERDISC (as of 2007)!",1201651200,,1544,5.248979591836735
