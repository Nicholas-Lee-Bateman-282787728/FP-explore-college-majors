2643804,3,B000HWXQHU,"This is the second mummy movie from the Hammer Studios.  Made in 1964, at the height of the studios monster cycle, this entry at best an average horror movie.  Like its predecessor, The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb presents a back story of two Egyptian brothers who vied for their father's throne.  One brother, Be has Ra slain but his pendant of eternal life is lost. Ra is mummified and seeks revenge when his tomb is disturbed by European Egyptologists.  Adding to the story is the greed of the American backer of the expedition, Alexander King (played with gusto by Fred Clark) insists on taking the mummy and his relics on a world tour. Also, the movie producers decide to infuse an eternal youth side story which adds a new spin to the old mummy formula.  Overall, the movie has its moments but is hurt by a poor female lead (Jeanne Roland) whose accent is quite thick, shoddy mummy make-up and an unnecessary love triangle.  The ending is a let down with the mummy mercifully is laid to rest in a London sewer.  YIKES!",1369699200,2,1022,4.521739130434782
2643805,4,B000HWXQHU,"This ""mummy"" story is a bit different. Does NOT star the dynamic duo of Lee & Cushing (thank you, Jaime Contreras for bringing that to my attention.) This Mummy story is a bit different and just as captivating. I would still recommend this movie even though the ""duo"" aren't in it. There is a lovely victim, but clad in tempting dress so you can actually use your imagination. Oh for the days of old!!",1354147200,3,401,4.4324324324324325

8141649,5,B000HWXQHU,"This is possibly the best of the old Mummy movies ever made. Forget the modern Mummy movie ripoffs. This is how to do a Mummy movie. Creepy with a mystery subplot. A romantic subplot. And the horror it all brings to life. In this case, the Mummy is not what he seems to be and one of the good guys is not what he seems to be. The mystery is how the two have anything to do with the other. They don't make movies of this creepiness and mystery anymore.",1498953600,,451,4.022222222222222

8141653,3,B000HWXQHU,"It's lovely to look at, with a nice evil Mummy and color shots, but the story is not that interesting.  Most of the time is spent on tedious chatting between dull people and then with an idiotic plot twist at the end.

Still, pick it up if you are a Mummy completest.

8141655,2,B000HWXQHU,"Belated and disappointing follow-up to Hammer's 1959 remake. ""The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb"" (1964) is colorfully made but forgettable  even less inspired than the Universal sequels. Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and director Terence Fisher are sorely missed. Hammer aficionados will encounter few shocks this time around.",1382227200,,323,5.872340425531915
8141656,3,B000HWXQHU,"Mister, know ye now the legend of the Pharaoh Ra-Antef and the associated curse of the mummy's tomb - or if you've a yen for something more bombastic - The Curse (-urse, -urse) of the Mummmmmy's Tooooomb (-ooomb, -ooomb, echo, echo)!! Peel away three thousand years as, in ancient Egypt, the two sons of Ramses VIII engaged in fatal politics, one brother masterminding the assassination of the other. Cut now to the year 1900, in ""present-day"" Egypt, as a European expedition has dug up the tomb of the murdered brother, Ra-Antef. Ominous warnings are bandied about promising horrible deaths to those who've disturbed the mummy's rest. Saunters in the expedition's crass American backer who dismisses the genteel archaeologists' notion of staging the mummy and its artifacts in a musty museum. No, Alexander King (a blustery Fred Clark), who admires P.T. Barnum, intends to exhibit the historic find in a mercenary world tour. Somewhere along the way, as an aside, we learn how the exotic delicacy got its name ""Turkish Delight.""

Much of Hammer Films' success in the late '50s and '60s was due to their lifting of Universal Studios' 1930s classic horror pictures. And, of course, chunks of credit are also directed at Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, neither of whom surfaces in 1964's THE CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB. It's the second of four mummy films Hammer would produce... and it's not so bad. But, yeah, the absence of Karloff, of Cushing and Lee, and even of Brandon Frasier is felt.

Instead we get Terence Morgan (intrepid mystery man ""Adam Beauchamp"") and Ronald Howard (boring lump ""John Bray""), two thirds of an uncomfortable romantic triangle in which I ended up rooting for the boring lump. The third leg falls to Jeanne Roland (""Annette Dubois"") who is basically on camera for ogling purposes. Not even all of Ra-Antef's bangages can cover up Roland's acting lack. When the mummy turns out to be more sympathetic than the leading lady, something's up.

The narrative eventually shifts to London, bringing with it the strange things happening, the brutal assaults on our cast, and the lurid melodrama. Hammer Films, by this stage, has worked its kinks out in its very own corner of horror cinema. There's a distinct Hammer vibe that's present here, and that's fun. The plot unfolds in ways that you fully anticipate. I did get surprised at how the Egyptian liaison invited his own doom. But if you find yourself watching this, do stick around for the ending, which is pretty neat. There's an interesting reveal at the eleventh hour and a climax that may be understated but is quite effective and, um, wraps things up nicely.
