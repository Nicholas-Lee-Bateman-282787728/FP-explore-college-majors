Island of Lost Souls (1974) is a Mexican Exploitation film following, not very successfully I might add, in the footsteps of the superb, Papillon (1973). Basically it is a poor man's version of an island convict escape attempt but there's really no big escape to set the piece up.

It's composed of vignettes and forced labor scenes and a beginning story that is blatantly absurd.

Ren Cardona Sr, who was an in-house Mexican Director, along with his son, did the film. Together they produced, directed and distributed numerous low-budget Exploitation films that weren't very good but are noted for having burnt out Hollywood actors and exotic themes (Guyana: Crime of the Century (1979), Carlos the Terrorist (1979), Cyclone (1978), The Bermuda Triangle (1978), Tintorera! Tiger Shark (1977)).

It's padded by mundane scenes, that are most of the time, boring and don't add any drama. A hilarious escape scene includes a convict trying to make a swim for it against the wave current with a dead Pelican hat in full view of the guards. He's blown to bits by a fused dynamite (how it stayed lit in water we never know).

What's lacking is any concern for the main character, who is an annoying 40 year old ""young man"" who was wronged by a lascivious land owner. He disappears for most of the film and it takes a turn for the bizarre when the General goes mad and declares the prison a ""free republic"" but threatens to cut off the gonads of anyone attempting an escape. He faces a modern 1960's ship (notice radar) with an 1865 cannon in another unintentional comic scene. Guess who wins?

It's based on a novel, the author, whom I surmise was stuck on ""Devil's Island"" -- Islas Maras Federal Prison (Built in 1905), Islas Maras (an archipelago of four islands that belong to Mexico).

In all, there's not much here but see it if you have to at least for the laughable scenes and tinted color of the film stock.

The Treasure of the Amazon (1985)

It is sad when decent actors are involved in cheap rubbish like this that squander their talents. Most notable are Stuart Whitman, who is a very competent actor but when placed in a cheap jungle thriller, albeit lacking any thrill, one wonders why they stooped so low. This is absolutely one of the worst films I have seen, it is amateurish, directed by some hack Ren Cardona Jr., who did numerous other junk that probably isn't worth seeing either. Evident are a lack of story, character study or anything that resembles ""action"", instead, one dumb scene is added to the next. The editing is incongruent, many scenes looked as if they were filmed in the same ""jungle location"" or a mediocre studio. Loud music and dumb 'moments' signal the start of the supposed action, such as a man falling into a river and showing stock footage of crocs going into the water, not very exciting. There was a stupid Fulci scene in where a man is ""torn"" to pieces by small crabs in one of the most absurd scenes ever. The acting is atrocious from the minor leads, who can't even speak English very well, and it ruins their credulity. Donald Pleasence, who is also normally very good, was terrible here. There is nothing to motivate the audience, this is entirely dull and a complete waste.",1428019200,2,3261,4.667247386759582
8195741,3,B000QCU9T4,"Treasure of the Amazon was the only one of the two movies I liked. Donald Pleasance was good as a fugitive Nazi hiding in the Amazon Jungle. Stuwart Whitman played a good lead character, a gold hunting oppertunist. And the Spanish speaking villan is the same actor who played General Mapache in Sam Pekinpaw's Wild Bunch (my favorite). Good action adventure, lots of topless Indian women, plenty of diffferent characters and not a disappointment. A Makenna's Gold type of movie but nowhere near the level of Makenna's Gold.",1309478400,2,523,4.954545454545454
