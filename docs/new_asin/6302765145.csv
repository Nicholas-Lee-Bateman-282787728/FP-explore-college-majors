HEXED: He's a loser, baby, so why don't you kill him? Of all the movies in this book, this one is perhaps the toughest to defend. But I watched it twice and laughed both times, so voila, here it is. ""Hexed"" has a kind of innocent charm, much like writer/director Spencer's TV series, ""Sledge Hammer."" Both emphasize over-the-top comedy and goofy humor about inherently violent events. While ""Sledge"" was a spoof of Dirty Harry flicks, ""Hexed"" is half Hitchcockian ""wrong man"" send-up and half a skewering of the ""Fatal Attraction""/""Basic Instinct"" femme fatale flicks.

Gross's role as dejected schlub is quirky, and more than one-dimensional; he's a compulsive storyteller who can't even convince himself of his own fantasies. Christian is energetically insane; only Shelly is underused. (Apparently Hal Hartley was the only director who knew how to use her special skills.) There's nothing new here (Hexina punches a mime! How daring!), but its lack of pretension is quite refreshing. ""Citizen Kane"" it ain't; 90 minutes of adolescent amusement, it is.",1421971200,,1313,4.963636363636364

513910,4,6302765145,"So a guy who lies to make up for a dull life and bad job finds a way to meet  an internationally famous supermodel, only to find that she has secret past....and is completely insane.

It's a comedy in the mode of ""Airplane!"" and features Claudia Christian (and perhaps sometimes her body-double) going full-tilt slapstick in this very funny movie.  Amazingly, it is showing up in the $3 bargain bins in one of those 4 movies in one box deals.

A bit too much T&A for the kids, but some great lines.

My favorite:  The guy says to Claudia, ""You're a MURDERESS!""  Enraged, she says, ""WHAT did you call me????""  He replies. "" A MURDERESS!!!""  She answers, ""Oh, I thought you said I was a METHODIST!""

513914,3,6302765145,"THEY'RE ALL WRONG.

The VHS [full screen] edition is superior to the cropped so called ""widescreen"" edition,if for only one reason:
the full screen vhs version shows more of Claudia Christian...In one scene,A LOT MORE.

There is a possibly unintentional Basic Instinct Sharon Stone uncrossing of legs type moment in the full screen vhs version of Hexed that is cropped out of the widescreen dvd version of Hexed.

And when it comes to the young Claudia Christian,less is less,especially when she isn't wearing any...under her dress.

For similar reasons,the full screen vhs version of AP:The Spy Who Shagged Me is superior to the widescreen dvd version. Nothing on Heather Graham should ever be cropped away.

All you get with ""widescreen"" is more of what doesn't matter on the far sides of the picture...In that one scene of Claudia Christian you get a great view of the couch she's sitting on,and a g-rated view of her.

What about the rest of the movie?..WHO CARES?..Sure the movie is funny,but none of us would be much interested if it weren't for a particular cast member,and it aint Arye Gross. I like Arye,don't get me wrong,but...

513934,4,6302765145,"To say this is a silly movie is an understatement.... it's so childish and pointless/so of course I loved it! Pretty basic, guy meets girl whom is really a crazy person on the run and the hijinks ensue!

  A guy working at a hotel meets his dream girl whom is a model, but with a twist.  The woman turns out to be much more than he ever bargained for.  A Hotel Clerk Matthew Welch (Arye Gross) lies his way into a date with the Supermodel Hexina (Claudia Christian).  Unbeknownst to Matthew however his date is actually a murderous psychopath and she tries to kill him, committing a couple of murders along the way with the evidence pointing towards Matthew.  Gloria (Adrienne Shelly) is Matthew's co worker  has been hoping he would only ask her out on a date.  When Mathew is in way over his head with Hexina, and needs help Gloria is there for him.  Will Mathew become Hexina's next victim?  Will Gloria be able to actually help him after all?

While the movie may be considered by some to not be very good, I really liked it a lot!  Considering the subject matter and the way it was done, it was actually surprising and enjoyable to see the actors, actresses, and everyone else involved pull it all of in such a funny and sarcastic way.

Virtual unknown Arye Gross is terrific as the lovable sad-sack and compulsive liar who cons his way into a date with Hexina, a psychotic supermodel bent on killing anyone who knows too much about her secret past.

Most of the fun comes from Arye Gross who tries to live his day to day life as someone who actually has a life. When he intercepts a call to meet the beautiful, Hexina, he gets more than he bargained for.

513940,4,6302765145,"While I thought Hexed (1993) was an entertaining feature, there was a slight bit of disappointment for me in that with a title like that for a film, I half expected there to be some supernatural elements involved within the story, but there wasn't...I will say this, though, whatever disappointment I may have had over the title in relation to the film vanished once Claudia `Ivanova' Christian (The Hidden, Maniac Cop 2, ""Babylon 5"") made the scene...homina homina...written and directed by Alan Spencer (""Sledge Hammer!""), the film stars, along with Ms. Christian, Arye Gross (Soul Man, House II: The Second Story).  Also appearing is Adrienne Shelly (I'll Take You There), R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket, Fletch Lives), Ray Baker (Silverado, Total Recall), Michael E. Knight (""All My Children""), and the late Norman Fell (Airport 1975, The End), probably best known as his role of the skeevy landlord Mr. Roper on the television sitcom ""Three's Company"".

Arye Gross plays the character Matthew Welsh, a hotel clerk who desires more from life than that which is his current lot, so much so he makes up all kinds of outrageous lies about his life, perhaps in the hopes some of them will come true (as the movie begins we see him arriving at the hotel on New Year's Eve dressed in a tuxedo, acting all snooty and mingling with the guest during a party before getting busted).  When the news of a special guest, a European super model named Hexina (Christian), gets around, Matthew immediately starts telling his co-workers about a bogus past relationship he had with the woman, to which no one believes him because everyone knows he's a rotten, stinking, filthy liar.  Anyway, certain circumstances present themselves in such a way that allows Matthew to impersonate an individual Hexina has come to town to visit, but has never met, leading up to a wild night of the boudoir boogie, capped off by Hexina trying to pierce Matthew's skull with a large carving knife.  Turns out the guy Matthew's impersonating is a blackmailer, one who's got compromising information about Hexina's past (she ends up being as big a phony as Matthew, but a hell of a lot more attractive), and she was only trying to throw a scare into him, or so she says...Matthew spills the beans about his real identity and then helps Hexina track down the guy he was impersonating, who Hexina ends up killing because it turns out that, along with being one of the world's hottest supermodels, she's also a homicidal lunatic, and will do anything to protect her secrets.  From here things go from bad to worse for Matthew as the bodies begin to pile up and the police, including Detective Ferguson (Ermey), see Matthew as the prime suspect, (it doesn't help that Hexina keeps planting evidence supporting this notion).

If you're familiar with the type of comedy featured in Alan Spencer's late 1980s television series Sledge Hammer!, starring David Rasche, then you'll have a pretty good idea what to expect here, the main difference being here things are slightly more raunchy as there's a decent amount of profanity along with some nudity, two elements that obviously wouldn't fly on network television.  If you're not familiar with the television series then imagine the humor from the Naked Gun television series and films, only a little darker.  The jokes here range from sort of lame to pretty funny, but the main problem, at least as I see it, is there's about as many present as there was in a half hour episode of Sledge, stretched out here to fill an hour an half film (I won't even get into trying to compare the comedic ability of Arye Gross to David Rasche).  The funniest bit for me was when Matthew, in an effort to perpetuate his story about having had a relationship with Hexina, takes headshots of himself and pastes them onto pictures with Hexina, eventually trying to pass one off on his co-workers as the real deal...suffice to say they look ridiculously fake, capable of fooling perhaps a mentally challenged three year old child.  There's not much of a story here as what's present seems here more just to prop up the gags than anything else.  I've never a big fan of Arye Gross and his receding hairline, so I had a hard time getting behind his character specifically because he was sniveling, little liar who scammed his way into Christian's character's pants and spends the rest of the time freaking out in lame fashion...maybe there's some jealously on my part seeing as how he got to appear with her sans her clothes, but beyond that I never felt like he was leading man material.  He comes off more as a supporting character, and an odious one at that.  As far as Ms. Christian, she seemed the dominant character in the film, and generally a lot more fun to watch (I hardly noticed Arye Gross when the two appeared together in a scene).  She does appear nekkid a couple of times, but there's no full on frontal, only a full on behind shot and some quick side shots.  This, along with the profanity, is what garnered the `R' rating.  R. Lee Ermey makes a good showing as a police detective, along with showing he can do humor, and Michael E. Knight appears as Matthew's condescending, slimy, a-hole superior Simon, a role which I really enjoyed as the guy was such a skeevy weasel I couldn't help laugh when he was on screen, terrorizing Gross' character.  Given his penchant for antagonizing the main protagonist in the film, you know something suitably bad will happen to him (and it does), so enjoy his screen time while you can (the scene where he's checking out Matthew's apartment really made me laugh).  One thing that sort of puzzles me is why Alan Spencer didn't just make a Sledge Hammer! feature film instead of this, as I think it would have been much better received, but whatever...all in all this movie is probably best left to Sledge fans, guys who've got a thing for Claudia Christian (I happen to be both), and/or people who can appreciate dark, silly humor in general.

The picture, presented in widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1), comes across clean and clear, and the Dolby Surround audio sounds decent.  The are some special features available including English, Japanese, and Spanish subtitles, three deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a director's commentary track for the film, a four minute promotional featurette for the film, and a theatrical trailer.  Also included are previews for other DVD releases like Little Black Book (2004), 50 First Dates (2004), The Sweetest Thing (2002), D.E.B.S. (2004), and Stripes (1981).

513941,5,6302765145,"First of all, let me say that Hexed is not your usual kind of comedy. It has a sort of evolving kind of humor to it that is really quite brilliant. In the begining it is more akin to the kind of humor you'd get out of a Ben Stiller movie like Meet the Parents or Zoolander. But as the story progresses the humor subtily and stedily changes and evolves until it reaches a Zucker Brothers style of sillyness like that of the Naked Gun series. This transition is part of what makes the movie so hysterical because it doen't start by clubbing you over then head with the hard stuff. It works you into it till you're ready for the more over-the-top material. But throughout, be it subtile or slap-stick, the overall brand of humor is dark (just the way I like it).

As to the bonus material, the comentary track by director Alan Spencer is one of the best I've heard. Though all by himself (sorry, no Claudia Christian) the guy keeps you informed and entertained all at once. And somehow, he manages to keep talking continiously throughout non-stop from the start right through the ending credits. No lulls or pauses, which I find kind annoying. By the end of the track not only will you have a good feel for the production, but also all the really good material that the studio wouldn't let him include.",1128902400,16,1299,4.435146443514644
513942,5,6302765145,Claudia Christian gives a brilliant comedic performance as the model Hexina in this hysterical dark comedy. The sex scene is one of the funniest scenes recorded on film and the rest of the movie keeps up the laughs. Alan Spencer's director's commentary makes a second viewing of the movie even funnier and should not be missed.,1125273600,9,327,4.857142857142857
513949,5,6302765145,"""Hexed"" was mistakenly marketed by the studio as a ""spoof,"" which it isn't.  Alan Spencer's DVD commentary makes that clear.  The movie was a dark comedy about a pair of dueling liars, one famous and one not, and how celebrities can get away with anything.  While it features slapstick and sight gags, the tone is different than ""Sledge Hammer!"" but still provides a few shock laughs like the police brutality scene.  Some people love this movie and others hate it.  Ironically, the DVD release has been getting good reviews as the movie was a bit ahead of the curve in some ways.  Decide for yourself because it will be never be accused of being bland.  A deleted scene involving Shakespeare should have been included in the final cut and what a pity Spencer's director's cut doesn't exist somewhere, especially with the original choice of theme music, the song from the movie ""Valley of the Dolls,"" which he talks about on the commentary.  I look forward to another Alan Spencer film as well as the return of ""Sledge Hammer!""",1123977600,7,1027,4.730337078651686

Paced perfectly, Hexed features a great mix of slapstick, parody and intelligent humor - everything that's missing from today's ""comedies."" The police chase of Matthew through the hotel is one of the funniest sequences I've ever seen. For even more laughs, watch it a second time with writer/director Alan Spencer's commentary.

Alan Spencer, the producer of that great TV series SLEDGE HAMMER!, wrote and directed this hilarious romp.  Ayre Gross and Claudia Christian starred as the star-crossed madcap lovers. Many fans will recognize Claudia Christian from her role as Commander Susan Ivanova on TV's BABYLON FIVE, and she steals the show with a great comic performance.

The extras should not be skipped. Alan Spencer's audio commentary is a masterpiece of intelligent, witty narration.  His background information on the filming is like taking a course on filmmaking.

She soon becomes the guest in his life who has outstayed her welcome after she tries to kill him and leaves a dead body in his fridge. One problem;She won't leave (him alone)...
 Hexed is a dark comedy that pokes strong tongue n' cheek humor at other more seriously sinister and sexually charged films dealing with obsession and it's consequences (Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct).So it's by no coincidence the story writers of this little dark comedy chose such appropriate timing. As one previous reviewer pointed out, this is not a film to be analyzed psychologically,socially, or even philosophically on any level. It's not worth the waste of brain wave activity. It's a satirical look that also makes fun of the modeling and fashion industries...
Actors Arye Gross and Claudia Christian have a great comedic chemistry on-screen;They never miss a beat. Christian's sexy physique and statuesque acting persona are very similar to those of Kirsten Johnson from 3rd Rock comedy t.v. series. Both women can have killer(no pun intended) model looks yet there's a biting comical wit that lies beneath the beauty. Arye Gross has had bit roles here and there. His last memorable bit role was in Nicolas Cage's rendition of the 70's remake carstealing flick Gone in 60 Seconds. Gross played a twerp of a customer service geek at a posh car dealership in Gone.
