7933477,5,B000059H8Y,"When Regan declared a war on drugs, Wings Hauser answered the call. He also decided to stick it to those Dallas Cowboys and the NFL while he was at it. Wings plays a CIA guy who likes to play soccer with a volleyball in a Latin American country who has to get revenge when his NFL playing brother gets murdered along with his mom and other possibly mentally disabled brother. I only say that cause the one scene you see him in he acts like a crazed Deliverance style hillbilly. If you don't see how this is a plus to the film, the movie is not for you.

Wings is pretty great here. He does things that normally an action hero wouldn't like letting his random sidekick fly the helicopter that's killing more people than him. He also wears the worst short shorts ever. Seriously, it's high school football coach short. They seemed to be a recurring theme for him across multiple films too. It's impossible to dilute the awesomeness and unique Wings flavor that he brings to each production.

The movie is pretty good overall. It's sleazy. It makes a few pretty crazy logical leaps. The movie is also never ever boring. In a world where Steven Soderbourgh was applauded for showing 4 hours of murderous, communist homophobes walking in a jungle to no end point in Che, it's comforting to know there's a few people out there who still want you to have a good time. Wings is definitely one of them.",1459468800,,1393,4.480314960629921

(Referring to the high heels ripping through the rag top scene)Now, 23 years later, I relate to the movie differently. The car chase with the cement mixer is goofy out of pace and the bus crash aftermath was basically just a smerk. I looked forward to my favorite scene but seemed let down, just not sexy compared to whats out today. I liked the action with Randy and Clete in the second part of the movie and it had a decent enough story behind it to watch till the end.",1323302400,,556,4.205607476635514

CANNEL TV EPIC 'RENEGADE') chews up every scene he's in and spits it out, until he gets a Major Motor-Boat-Fu Lobotomy  by Wings.....who likes to take Loving Still Photographs after every 'Kill' he makes.....Bad Guys are Lit on Fire, Run Over, Dropped from Impossibly Great Heights...All to a Great Cheesy 80's Miami Vice type soundtrack....With several songs by the Great Issac Hayes!!....A Supreme Example of the great 70's/80's Grindhouse Action /Revenge Flick; NOT for the Politically Correct; Everyone Else Will LOVE IT!!",1216598400,6,1298,5.362745098039215
