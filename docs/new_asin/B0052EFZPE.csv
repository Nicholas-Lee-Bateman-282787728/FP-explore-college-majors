4529835,5,B0052EFZPE,This DVD is an excellent presentation of spiritual warfare.  We showed it to a small group in our house--and have now passed it along for use by a nearby small church.  Chip Ingram is a good teacher.,1362268800,2,199,4.351351351351352
4529836,5,B0052EFZPE,"All Christians should read this book. It is well written and answers many of the questions about the challenges we face daily in our walk with Christ. I found many answers to why we are challenged the most by Satan when we feel we are walking the walk with Christ. It is because Satan doesn't want that and he will do everything he can to derail us. Our world today is in serious trouble. Too many people have turned their backs on God and many people don't even know who he is. He has blessed the USA greatly, yet people don't really get it if they don't have faith in God.",1357862400,11,574,4.18018018018018

4529838,5,B0052EFZPE,"I purchased this study for myself to do at home but enjoyed it so much I decided to use it in my Ladies' Sunday school class.  It's a very conservative Biblical view of Satan, his demons and how they attack us when we are weak.  I believe it empowers us to be able to understand the ""when, why, and how"" the Devil works in this world. It, also, helps us to understand God provides all we need to fight against these attacks. It was an interesting and worthwhile study.",1409356800,2,468,4.247191011235955

We opted to go with the DVD as most attendees in our study don't have time to read the book.",1382918400,9,268,3.8727272727272726
4529846,5,B0052EFZPE,This program was so easy to read and understand.  I see and understand spiritual warfare as it really is.  No room is left in one's understanding of the why's and how's of the battle we are in.,1363305600,5,193,4.1891891891891895

8453846,5,B0052EFZPE,"Chip Ingram eloquently explains what it is that goes on around us between angels and demons at all times, and how we can be affected if we let our spiritual guard down. He uses scripture to back up his message, teaching us how to put on the Armor of God to win the fight. Our small group members agree that this DVD has helped us discern when we are facing the enemy in our lives and how we can protect ourselves from its influence. We recommend the The Invisible War to any person who wants to be empowered on a daily basis.",1446422400,,525,4.1568627450980395

8453848,5,B0052EFZPE,"This book uses biblical quotes throughout, is very focused and direct. Chip Ingram is a very good teacher, and this is a great tool for both a church or individual who is under spiritual attack or on the verge of possession. We used it as a guide for intercession, but if you understand anything about spiritual warfare, everything will go wrong when you you try to participate or even watch the DVD. Prepare for this through fast and prayer for maximum result.",1441497600,,461,4.634146341463414

8453850,5,B0052EFZPE,"An excellent DVD presentation of the elements of spiritual warfare of which too many Christians are unaware or disregard.  Chip Ingram's treatment of the subject is clear and well-tempered by appropriate references to the many Bible scriptures making clear that The Invisible War is real and that the craft and power of the Adversary (Satan) against believers are indeed great, but not necessarily overpowering.  A very practical and well-grounded presentation on victorious engagement of him in spiritual combat...well-received by our Sunday school class!",1426032000,2,556,5.686746987951807
