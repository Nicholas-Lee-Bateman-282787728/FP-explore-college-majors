8740919,5,B017X1UG8O,"First I will say that I am older (I was a young in the 70s) and that I found this adaptation very moving, well-acted, well cast, well written.  My 20s something niece and I watched the movie together and she also found it moving and truly uplifting for any girl/woman.  Very relatable and possibly helpful for the opposite gender as well (I have not experimented with this yet, but will do).  So important for me that I bought two copies (I think I may wear one out).  I fear that this review is disjointed, but I hope you can see the emotion behind it.",1489968000,,553,4.288461538461538
