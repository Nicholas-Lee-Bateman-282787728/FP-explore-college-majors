8333260,1,B001PHDL30,"I bought this because it was very discounted. But unfortunately the dvd is cheaply produced and edited, so you won't get to see the movements as you should. Also the instructor is very dull and boring to watch, so definitly you won't be watching this video more than once (if so).
Adding to this, the dvd came scratched and won't play. Very poor product.",1340150400,,354,4.546875
