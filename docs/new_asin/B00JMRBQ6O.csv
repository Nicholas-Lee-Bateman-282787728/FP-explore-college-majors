8652495,5,B00JMRBQ6O,"This is a wonderful story. Movie does deviate from the book slightly. Young readers (teens and pre-teens) will love it and can relate to the girl being bullied,the dysfunctional family ,and the old man with his dog. It is funny and heartwarming. PBS broadcast the movie at Christmas one year and I knew I had to have it for my granddaughters. It would quickly become a family classic if it were offered on US television. It is one of those movies that children love their entire lives.",1421366400,,485,4.586206896551724
