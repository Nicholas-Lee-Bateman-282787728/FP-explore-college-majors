4153605,5,B003LR5BBC,"I must confess I had no idea who Bayard Rustin was when I encountered this documentary.  Once it began, I was immediately fascinated by his person and his story.  It's a shame that there are so many others like myself out there who still don't know who this man is.  This is a wonderfully executed film and it should be compulsory viewing for ALL students in public schools, but especially for black and gay children.  My first thought after I finished watching this film was ""My God, if Bayard Rustin were alive today, we would already have gay rights.  He would have won them for us""  My second thought was ""I must tell everyone about this film"", and I have.  I have given friends copies of it, and I have recommended it to all, even to strangers.  My deepest thanks to the filmmakers for giving us this wonderful history lesson.  I sincerely hope schools pick up on it and make it part of their history curriculum.  There is too much ignorance in this country, and generations of black and gay children are growing up without real heroes to inspire them.  How sad that they would look up to trash like Lady Gaga or some gangster rapper when there are men like Bayard Rustin they can admire and emulate.  Oh, how we need a Bayard Rustin today!",1322524800,4,1245,4.460176991150442

We were all stunned as the four of us watched. Amazing man. Incredible story. Triumphant and tragic. And those who made this doco did an A+ job! Not yet available on Netflix, but please order it from them, and put some pressure on. Then buy the film from Amazon and gift it to your public library or place of worship after your viewing. It's that good!",1302393600,7,534,4.144230769230769
4153607,5,B003LR5BBC,"I was about 100 pages into the outstanding 2003 book Lost Prophet by John D'Emilo, and wanted to see what else was out there on the impressive MR. RUSTIN. When I stumbled upon BROTHER OUTSIDER on Amazon I new I had to pre-order it, and I'm so glad I did! I had heard of BAYARD RUSTIN before this wonderful documentary many years ago, yet I didn't know too much about this enigmatic figure; I did know many years back he was someone I did want to get aquainted with - much like Edward Carpenter. For me the political, spiritual, and sexual come together in a rich tapestry that is the soul of the amazing BAYARD RUSTIN. This man truely utilized his life, and by the time he took his last breath he left an impact of loving force and beauty that ripples around the Earth today. Its mind boggling to me how much better he left this planet than when he came into it. BROTHERHOOD OUTSIDER is a great first step in getting familiar with RUSTIN. The times he lived through and how he choose to live through them are nothing short of revolutionary. He is simply one of the most important people in the all the history of the civil rights movement. A teacher to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., an international apostle of peace, and the organizer of the famous 1963 March on Washington, he also brought Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence to the USA, and helped launch the civil rights movement. BAYARD was also an openly gay man which is why he's been extremely downplayed or ""forgotten"" from the history books. This man was fearless and he put himself in harms way for the greater good for many of us down the line. He was peacefully struggling for African American civil rights, not to mention dealing with all the extremely fierce homophobia of the 1940's, 1950's, and 1960's - NOT A JOY!!!. All else I can say is that I wish I could have known this man, and that I think he's a new Hero of mine!!! R.I.P. BAYARD RUSTIN - YOUR ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS !!!",1278720000,36,1941,4.394444444444445
4153608,5,B003LR5BBC,"""Brother Outsider"" is a truly inspirational film highlighting the life of Bayard Rustin, one of the most important and influential Civil Rights activists.  Rustin was not only African American in a time of segregation, but he was gay as well. However, this did not stop him from being who he was. He was interested in making people more tolerant through non-violent approaches. His bravery helped the Civil Rights movement to gain the great momentum that it finally developed.

Not only was Rustin a gay African American, but he also had a partner that was white, which made him stand out even more. While he was not always accepted, even by his fellow civil rights activists, he always kept his head up and believed in his choices and causes. Rustin wanted acceptance for everyone. His non-violent approach allowed him to work with the likes of Martin Luther King Jr. in trying to get equal rights for African Americans in the United States.

This film introduces us to Rustin through current interviews and archival footage that allow us to see just how unique he was as a person. One of the most interesting aspects of the film highlights Rustin's determination and unwillingness to give up. Adam Clayton Powell tried to hold Rustin's sexuality against him during the 1960 Democratic Convention. Powell threatened to spread rumors about Rustin's sexuality if the Civil Rights activists did not stop protesting. This threat got to Martin Luther King Jr., but did not scare Rustin. He continued on fighting for what he believed in.

This film is extremely educational and enjoyable as it highlights the life of someone who was extremely important in the Civil Rights Movement yet never got the credit that they deserved. I enjoyed this film a great deal.",1275955200,19,1755,4.938983050847457
4153609,5,B003LR5BBC,"""Brother Outsider"" highlights the life of Bayard Rustin, an extremely influential African American male. Rustin was one of the great intellectual activists who was non-violent, gay and Quaker. Although he played a major role in the Civil Rights march, many people do not know much about him. Rustin was an extremely brave man who was not afraid to overcome social taboos. Not only was he gay in a time when nobody spoke about it, but he also had a white partner. He never tried to hide any details about his personal life and was open about being accepting towards everyone.

Bayard Rustin was an activist who believed only in non-violent movements. He was a conscientious objector during World War II and did his part in fighting against inequality once the war ended. While Rustin was not accepted by everyone -sometimes not even his fellow Civil Rights activists- he always worked his hardest to make contributions to the movement. His sense of humor and determination allowed him to stick out and be successful in what he did.

The archival material added to the overall success of this film as it allowed us to see Rustin in action. It really brought his conscious activism to the surface and conveyed what a truly amazing man Rustin was. All of the controversial topics in this film really kept me at the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next.",1275955200,10,1365,4.73109243697479
4153610,5,B003LR5BBC,"Watched the documentary with a bunch of friends. Bayard Rustin- was an African American, Quaker, Gay, brilliant strategist, architect of the March on Washington in 1963 and to my surprise went to India and met with Gandhi and then took what he learned to MLK. Although several people announced that they were just passing through when they sat down for the movie - none of them left the room. I can't tell you how spell binding this was.(There are some violent scenes when people are being attacked but I hope you won't let that stop you,) There is a study guide online somewhere.

Now that I know to look for Bayard, I have started noticing him in pictures of a lot of civil rights events. There was a clip of John Lewis making a speech at the march on Washington on the Rachel Maddow show and there was Bayard right behind him (smoking a cigarette- LOL)

There ar ea lot of good quotes in the movie. I don't know if this one was in there but it is one of my favorite quotes of his: quote from Bayard ""We need, in every community, a group of angelic troublemakers."" I hope this movie will inspire you.",1429056000,4,1102,4.3707317073170735

4153618,5,B003LR5BBC,This book offers amazing insight into an unacknowledged key activist within the civil rights movement!  One also learns from Bayard how to live with total honesty -- whether your choices are respected or not  --the self respect and self actualization is far more important.

4153628,5,B003LR5BBC,"Before watching Brother Outsider, I had never heard of Bayard Rustin, despite having learned about the Civil Rights movement several times when I was in school. He is most recognized as the organizer of the March on Washington (which celebrates its 50th anniversary this August), but unfortunately his sexual orientation has overshadowed his commitment to equality. His fellow civil rights leaders frowned upon Bayard's open homosexuality, at times even using it against him to force him to comply with their agendas. Despite the negativity from the public and his peers, Rustin courageously kept his head up, never concealed his true self or beliefs, and fought for civil rights in a creative and peaceful ways. He mentored Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. regarding the significance of non-violent protests, adopting Ghandi's famous pacifist agenda. This well-constructed documentary portrays Rustin's life through interviews and archival footage, which together weave a powerful impression on the viewer. Everyone should watch this film, as it successfully shows viewers the life of a man who did not deserve to be written out of the history books.",1375056000,2,1145,5.402234636871508

4153637,5,B003LR5BBC,Great history information for today's education.  Tells a great deal about the persons involved with the civil rights issues faced by Black Americans and some of the people instrumental in making a change.

An informed dissenting voice is always useful when faced with such revisionism.",1355097600,,434,5.304347826086956
4153639,5,B003LR5BBC,"""Brother Outsider: The Life of Bayard Rustin"" is an outstanding and informative documentary that focuses on the life and times of one of the bravest civil rights leaders ever, Bayard Rustin (March 17, 1912 - August 24, 1987). In addition to helping to lead the battle for equality for African-Americans; Rustin fought hard for pacifism and non-violence--and even gay rights. Indeed, Bayard had no fear; he never shied away from trouble if he felt it was going to achieve a better quality of life for black people or the LGBTQ community ---or any group of human beings who were unfairly disenfranchised.

His grandmother taught him the importance of equality and later on in his life Rustin was very much influenced by Gandhi's non-violent resistance movement against British rule in India. During his lifetime Bayard joined groups he believed were working for equality including the Communist Party USA (CPUSA); The Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) with its pacifist leader A. J. Muste. Bayard Rustin also deserves credit for being the organizer of the 1963 March on Washington; and he was an advisor to the great Martin Luther King, Jr. despite the fact that they had a bumpy relationship at times caused primarily by the fact that Bayard was openly gay and people, even Bayard's fellow black leader Adam Clayton Powell, threatened to use Bayard's sexual preference and his 1953 arrest on a ""sex crime morals charge"" against Bayard if he didn't keep quiet and do what the other black leaders wanted him to do.

Of course, it may seem as if I've told you way too much about Bayard Rustin; but I assure you that I haven't. There's quite a lot more about this bold genius that you'll discover as you watch the documentary. We get lots of interview time with people who knew Bayard well--his nephew, people who worked with Bayard as his assistants and even two of his lovers give fascinating insights into the psyche of Bayard Rustin; it's all very well done. In addition, the filmmakers did a great job of integrating still photos of Rustin and others with archival footage; the narration in this film is also useful since it tells us even more about what Bayard thought. True, there aren't any bonus features on the DVD but then again the film is so well done that there really isn't any need for bonus features.

I recommend ""Brother Outsider: The Life of Bayard Rustin"" for anyone studying civil rights, gay rights, social movements using non-violent resistance and, of course, Bayard Rustin himself. Bayard Rustin is unjustly forgotten because he was an openly gay man as he fought all his life for equality and true justice; that's a terrible shame. In addition, people who appreciate inspiring biographical, historical, African-American and/or political documentaries would do well to get this for their collections.",1342569600,2,2822,4.97457627118644
