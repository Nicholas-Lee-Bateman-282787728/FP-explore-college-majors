6034944,4,B00FWVXRNE,"I actually bought--and enjoyed--the 2nd volume of the ""Best of Nitro"" before getting Volume 1. And much like that 2nd volume, the first edition of the best of Nitro was like revisiting an old friend you haven't seen for many years--but always enjoy the company of when you do get together.

As I said before in my writeup for Vol. 2, pro wrestling was at its peak during the Monday Night Wars & I have my doubts if wrestling will ever be that much fun again. Whether you were loyal to WCW or what was the WWF at that time--Monday Nights at 8pm were appointment viewing--and if for some reason you couldn't get to a tv set to watch it live, then you definitely had your VCR setup to tape the night's action--anyone remember VCRs, heh...

I still remember the next days after Nitro and Raw went off the air & getting together in school with all my buds and discussing the shows & the pros and cons of both organizations. Hell, I still have vivid memories of some of the talks we had after that infamous Monday Night when ""Razor Ramon"" stepped foot into a WCW ring.

That, of course, was the beginning of the mega-hot nWo angle--an angle that in retrospect was the thing that brought WCW to the top & eventually brought them crashing back down to earth--as yet again, I point to the night of Starrcade '97 & how that should have been the beginning of the nWo being phased out--but instead we got nWo overkill with the split into nWo Hollywood and Wolfpac.

And, there was that infamous night in early January '99 when I had hopes that WCW would climb back into the ratings battle with the WWF--and they had the main event that could have delivered those ratings--a Starrcade '98 rematch between Goldberg and Kevin Nash.

But, somehow that main event got switched to Nash vs. Hogan and the rest--as they say--is bad wrestling history. WCW never could recover from the ""fingerpoke of doom"", although there were the occasional bright spots--i.e. Sting's World Title match with DDP in April of '99.

And the last waning years of WCW were tough for even the most ardent WCW supporter to watch--although I will admit, I remember watching that first Nitro when the Russo and Bischoff era began & honestly, it wasn't a bad show at all. But it wasn't long after that, that Russo got complete control of the book again & the rest might be moments best reserved for Wrestlecrap.

But, I would say overall, the great WCW moments--and there were many of them--outweighed the bad & even WWE fans will tell you--if they were being honest--that the WWF product wasn't all grade A material during those years either.

In the end, if you're someone who likes to look back at what I call ""The Good Old Days"" of professional wrestling--then both volumes of ""The Best of Nitro"" deliver the goods.
4 stars",1415577600,,2780,4.557114228456914
6034945,2,B00FWVXRNE,Less than what I expected,1412467200,,25,4.2
6034946,5,B00FWVXRNE,"Got this DVD for my husband, as he is a huge wrestling fan, to add to his growing collection. He thought it was a great DVD.",1408924800,,124,3.8076923076923075
6034947,5,B00FWVXRNE,Looks good.,1404691200,,11,5.0
6034948,4,B00FWVXRNE,"There was always competition between WWE & WCW (and going back even further when it was the NWA) but this was the show that really turned that competition into an all out war...a Monday Night War...that went for 6 years until it finally ended around a decade ago.  The New World Order, luchadors & crusierweights, Four Horsemen, tag teams, metamorphosis of Sting...it's here to revisit in the Best Of Nitro.  Now a couple of notes here in that Diamond Dallas Page host the DVD & anyone that's been following the news in regards to this DVD knows that he completely changed the script WWE had for this set to his opinions are honest & direct.  In regards to Chris Benoit, the only footage that is edited in regards to him is during Ric Flair's return to Nitro when Arn Anderson is paying respect to each individual Horsemen member before introducing Flair but past that, he's clearly visible & acknowledged.  The only other footage that is edited (that I caught) is Goldberg being tazered during the ""Fingerpoke Of Doom.""  Along with the various matches are many Nitro moments including Scott Hall's Nitro Debut, Kevin Nash's debut two weeks later, Hollywood Hogan's first interview since forming the New World Order, the infamous incident of The Outsiders attacking WCW talent backstage at Disney MGM, another in-ring attack by the nWo, Lex Luger gets attacked outside by ""Sting"", Sting's speech to WCW where he declares himself a free agent, Roddy Piper revealing Eric Bischoff as part of the nWo, Eric Bischoff gets suspended, Sting's first drop from the rafters on Nitro, the parody of the Horsemen by the nWo, Chris Jericho names his 1,004 holds, Ric Flair returns to WCW & reforms the Horsemen, Bret Hall calls out Goldberg, Eric Bischoff & Vince Russo relaunch WCW, and Vince McMahon declaring his bought WCW.

Matches Include:
Brian Pillman vs. Jushin Liger - This was the debut match on WCW Monday Nitro and boy did they know how to kick this show off in style. This was very past paced with the high-flyin' action that you expected that wasn't always pretty (like a botched head scissors off the top rope) but also had a good mix of wrestling with moves like the surfboard/reverse headlock combination by Liger & a DDT off the top rope by Pillman. Great action as you would expect from both men.
Sept. 95
[Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon]

Hulk Hogan vs. Big Bubba Rogers - This was the first main event of Nitro that went back & forth between both men with the bigger issue being the confrontation with ex-WWE superstar Lex Luger afterwords.
Sept. 95

Randy Savage & Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair & Arn Anderson - Hogan & Savage were running wild early being very dominate including having duel figure fours on both men at one point before the Horsemen were able to regain control & at one point threw Savage over the top rope with such force that he landed underneath the guardrail before cutting the ring off & working over Savage building to the hot tag to Hogan. This was a fun tag match that would have normally been a main event on a WCW PPV but showcased Bischoff's strategy to put Nitro on the map in that he gave away these types of matches almost every week.
Jan. 96

WCW Tag Team Champions Match Sting & Lex Luger vs. Road Warriors - The Road Warriors (Legion Of Doom) reunited as a tag team & returned to WCW around a month earlier & right away challenged for the WCW Tag Team Titles setting up this match. Sting & Luger had their issues with each other as Luger couldn't completely be trusted because of his ways of taking shortcuts to get the victory which was clearly seen between the two partners early on. Luger targeted Animal's back, that was previously injured & took him out of action for an extended period of time, with various stomps & slams throughout the match before the action went back & forth between both teams with Luger once again getting assistance & taking a shortcut, unwanted by Sting, to get the advantage in what turned out to be a good tag team match.
As a side note, this match is more memorable for the power outage that happened during the match which made Eric Bischoff (at the time) go as far as accusing WWE of the power outage in an attempt to sabotage the show just showing how paranoid both companies got turning this period of the Monday Night War.
Feb. 96

Parking Lot Brawl: Belfast Bruiser vs. Steven Regal - For those who didn't already know, Belfast Bruiser is the wrestler we currently know as Finlay while Regal is the same wrestler we know today as William Regal. This was one of the most physical feuds in WCW at this time as both men didn't know the meaning of the word ""stiff"" & just beat the hell out of each other each time they competed against each other leading to this match. These two used anything & everything they could get their hands on in the parking lot including various weapons like a brick, bumper, tire, seat belt, and guardrail while taking hard bumps such as Finlay putting his foot through a car window & later being on the receiving end of a piledriver on the roof of a car. A very violent brawl with of course Bobby Heenan having to get the last word in the match that was just typical ""Brain.""
Apr. 96

Eddie Guerrero vs. Ric Flair - The previous night at Slamboree, Eddie teamed with Arn Anderson against Flair & Randy Savage in a ""Lethal Lottery"" match only for Anderson to turn on Guerrero to help Flair get the victory so Eddie was out for revenge here. They started off wrestling but got very aggressive over time with their exchanging of chops & Eddie bringing a fight to Flair to the point where he attempted to bring a chair into the ring. Eddie played Flair's own mind games against him by taunting him by going as far as to do his strut on the floor & even applying the figure four on Flair. Both men traded momentum & was very competitive before Guerrero ended up hurting his leg with a high risk move that led Flair to take advantage as only Flair knows how. Bobby Heenan described this match perfectly at the end, ""Guerrero gave him a fight.""
May 96

WCW Tag Team Champions Sting & Lex Luger vs. Steiner Brothers vs. Harlem Heat - This was a glorified handicap match as both teams had their issues with Harlem Heat causing them to not be able to tag out of the match but definitely delivered a good performance against both teams but this was more about what happened in the end that caused the most unusual finish to a match that anyone had ever seen at that time.
June 96

Sting & Lex Luger vs. Outsiders - After what happened at the Road Wild PPV days earlier, Sting & Luger wanted a rematch here with them playing their own mind games at the start against Hall & Nash. Nick Patrick was the referee & just let this them go making this an ""unofficial"" No Disqualification match as they brawling in the ring & on the floor but it was what happened towards the end of the match that had people begin to question of loyal of not just the wrestlers but also the officials when it came to the New World Order.
Aug. 96

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Dean Malenko - The night after Starrcade where both men suffered loses in the crusierweight division, both men were looking to rebound here. Malenko worked on grounding Rey & working over his back while Mysterio relied on his speed as both men knew each other so well that they were able to keep countering each others holds throughout the match. This didn't match or top their more famous encounters but still quality.
Dec. 96

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Mark Starr - Eric Bischoff & Ted Dibiase were doing the commentary here in what was nothing more than a squash match but it was the appearance of Hall & Nash after the match that was the real story here.
Jan. 97

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Syxx vs. Rey Mysterio Jr. - Nash was in Syxx's corner (referring to him as 6-Pac for the first time on television) as these two had a very fast paced match with Rey delivering a heavy amount of frankensteiners throughout the contest causing Syxx to use the numbers game against Rey. Earlier in the show, former Horsemen manager James J. Dillion was appointed to the position of WCW Commissioner & made his presence known.
Apr. 97

WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Lex Luger - This match happened on the 100th episode of ""WCW Monday Nitro"" and after chasing Hogan for months, Luger got his title shot here. This was a different Hollywood Hogan than usual as he didn't try to stall & avoid Luger but went straight at him & took the fight to Luger. This match was as good as you expected it to be for television with Luger overcoming Hogan & the nWo to finally bring back the WCW Championship to WCW.
Aug. 97
[Greatest Stars Of The 90's]

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Buff Bagwell - This was a nice match but nothing very special past a tease of a confrontation between page & his old acquaintance in Raven.
Sept. 97

Sting vs. Randy Savage - ""Madness"" was the definition of Randy Savage at this point of his career because he had no allies in WCW but also alienated himself from all the members of the nWo so he was a man to himself. These two brawled on the floor right away & kept that mentality as this was just an aggressive fight with both men trading fist & even had the ringside steps get involved here before the issues between WCW & nWo along with the nWo members themselves resulted in all out chaos.
Feb. 98

WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Goldberg - This was more about putting Goldberg over as WCW's ""superhero"" & top star more than anything else as Hogan threw everything he could at Goldberg by either wrestling him & resorting to cheating only for Goldberg to not be effected by it & keep coming back dominating his way to the WCW Championship. With cameos from Dallas Page, Karl Malone, and Curt Hennig...this wasn't much as far as a ""match"" goes but this was all about making Goldberg the top superstar in WCW.
July 98
[Monday Night War; History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]

WCW Tag Team Champions Kevin Nash & Sting vs. Scott Hall & The Giant - Only two months earlier at Slamboree, Sting was a member of WCW teaming with Giant who had just recently joined nWo Hollywood against Hall & Nash who were nWo Wolfpack members...fast forward only two months later & we have the same four guys in a tag team match but under completely different circumstances. This match was booked right away after a fight both nWo factions had backstage the point where Sting wasn't even in his ring gear but jeans & a shirt. This was a fun tag team match that was non-stop action with a hot crowd & both teams trading momentum.
July 98

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Chris Jericho - This started off with a bang as Mysterio was jumped by Jericho getting into the ring. Both took to the air with high risk moves such as a top rope dropkick on Mysterio that knocked him to the floor with the back of his head hitting the railing while Jericho later missed his springboard dropkick that sent him outside to the floor before later being frankensteinered off the apron into the ring. Jericho also tried at one point a very unique submission that Mike Tenay could only try to describe as an ""octopus"" & also delivering one hell of a release german suplex that flipped Rey inside out. This was definitely a great crusierweight match between the two that also continues the setup of Jericho's match going into the next PPV in regards to who counted the final pinfall.
Aug. 98

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Juventud Guerrera vs. Billy Kidman - This was Kidman's first match since leaving Raven's flock complete with him having his clean cut look back after being dirty & scratching himself for a year. Anyone who remembers the series of matches Kidman & Juvi had throughout the entire year knows that each one was very fast paced & high impact with this being absolutely no exception including various moves & moments such as Kidman delivering a variation of a back suplex that seemed to knock Juvi out for a few moments along with later catching Juvi in midair with a powerbomb while Juvi brought it himself with moves like a release german suplex along with his high flying offense but the ending was a performance that had one talent give the other one a standing ovation.
Sept. 98

WCW United States Champion Bret Hart vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This was the night after Halloween Havoc with DDP coming into this match being very exhausted from his intense match with Goldberg that he showed signs of it from the previous night to the point where at one time Page couldn't apply an armbar correctly so he just went for a pin instead. They traded momentum here as Bret was more focused on brawling & taking shortcuts than out-wrestling DDP such as doing moves like a low blow. This was a good match with a very brutal aftermath.
Oct. 98

Ric Flair vs. Eric Bischoff - After the screwjob Bischoff did to Flair the previous night at Starrcade, Flair got a rematch with all of his money on the line against Bischoff's job as the WCW President. This was nothing more than Ric Flair delivering the beating that everyone in WCW (and maybe even other companies) wanted to see Bischoff get for the longest time as Flair was just running on pure emotion to the point where he threw Charles Robinson out of the way just to beat on Bischoff. The Horsemen were there to make sure we didn't get a repeat of what happened at Starrcade while one superstar who wasn't seen for months also made his return that resulted in so many of the WCW talents (including Tony Schavone himself) having a well deserved celebration.
Dec. 98

WCW Champion Kevin Nash vs. Hollywood Hogan - This was the INFAMOUS ""fingerpoke of doom"" where quite frankly the less said the better but it should be noted that the use of the tazer was edited out of this footage.
Jan. 99

WCW Champion Diamond Dallas Page vs. Sting - Both men began by trading punches with DDP showing heel tenancies such as pulling hair, delivering a low blow & constantly going to floor whenever Sting began to build momentum. The referee let these men get away with what would usually result in a disqualification resulting in both men brawling on the outside & bouncing each other off the guardrail before Page went after Sting's knee & used the post in the process. This was a very intense & high impact match here with the crowd being very hot from start to finish with one moment to look out for being Sting giving DDP one of the nastiest looking piledrivers I've seen that made me cringe a little when I saw it. DDP said after this match that this was one of the best in his career & I can't say I disagree.
Apr. 99

Eddie Guerrero vs. Juventud Guerrera - This was Eddie's return to the ring after his motorcycle accident earlier in the year with the story of Juventud trying to show respect to Eddie early on only for Eddie to make it clear that he was out for revenge for Juvi & the other luchadors abandoning the Latino World Order (DON'T ASK!) once Eddie was out injured. Not much of note here except it was very fast paced with Juvi giving Eddie some hard chops that left Eddie's chest red but Guerrero looked like he hadn't lost a step & possibly in the best physical shape of his career.
June 99

Hulk Hogan, Goldberg, Sting vs. Kevin Nash, Sid Vicious, Rick Steiner - Before the match got started, we had a memorable moment in the return of HULK Hogan. This was more of a preview of the upcoming matches between members of each team coming up at the Road Wild PPV along with getting the tease of the upcoming ""Battle Of The Millennium Man"" between Goldberg & Sid. A fun six man tag match overall with Hogan showing that his old self might be back but he has no problems resorting back to his ""Hollywood"" ways when necessary.
Aug. 99

Billy Kidman vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This was pretty short & sweet with DDP being in a jealous rage over comments Kidman about Kimberly before we saw his anger get the best of him.
Aug. 99

WCW Championship Match: Bret Hart vs. Goldberg - This match was during the initial ""Vince Russo"" era of WCW & happened the night after Starrcade where we got that ""screwjob"" ending in the match between these two resulting in Bret Hart forfeiting the championship & having a rematch here to determine the true champion. Goldberg showcased early that he had the clear power advantage before both men decided on the same strategy on working on each others legs with Goldberg executing an anklelock while Bret did a figure four. The big picture though was how everything went down during the match that led to not only a champion to be determined but also ""The Band Is Back Together!""
Dec. 99

WCW Championship Match: Sid Vicious vs. Kevin Nash - Although it wasn't brought up or discussed during the match, this was for WCW Championship that became vacant after Chris Benoit won the WCW Title despite making it clear that he was quitting the company & it should also be noted that Nash was the WCW Commissioner at this time so he banned Sid from using the powerbomb. As anyone who remembered their series back in the WWE around 5 years earlier got around the same match here in that it was just an average big man match with the match being taken into the front row at one point with later Sid proving the phrase ""he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer"" wrong as he was able to outsmart everyone towards the end.
Jan. 00

Steel Cage Match: WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Diamond Dallas Page - The cage used for this match was the regular sized cage but also had a top on it (like WCW did with the War Games matches) while Vince Russo was in Jarrett's corner. Knowing how personal this feud was between these two (including Page's wife serving him with divorce papers earlier in the show), they started this fight on the outside & went through the crowd with even a trash can being used before making it's way to the cage. Anyone who remembers the ""Russo"" era of WCW knows what to expect here as far as run-ins & chaos but it didn't effect what was a good match.
Apr. 00

Ladder Match: Jung Dragons vs. 3 Count - Former MMA fighter Tank Abott came out to the ring to introduce WCW's resident boy band 3 Count & dance to their music (yes, you read that right) before the Yung Dragons came out to start this match off. This match was short but still had it's moments like a superplex off the ladder that was on the top rope, an airplane spin with the ladder that knocked out everyone in sight, and Evan's dangerous fall to the floor. This was the beginning of what many would consider one of the last great feuds of WCW between these six crusierweights as we saw that they would top this match at the upcoming New Blood Rising PPV & months later at Starrcade but this was good for what it was.
July 00

WCW Champion Booker T. vs. Lance Storm - Lance Storm was only in WCW for a short time here but made one hell of an impact as he became a triple crown champion by capturing all of the singles titles (U.S., Hardcore, Crusierweight) so now he was going for the ""Grand Slam"" by challenging for the biggest one of them all in the WCW Championship. The match was real short but was a good contest here for what it was if you can get past the distractions like Mike Awesome on commentary doing his ""Fat Chick Thriller"" gimmick (Don't Ask!).

[Rise & Fall Of WCW]

Triple Cage War Games Match: WCW Champion Kevin Nash, Jeff Jarrett, Scott Steiner, Vince Russo vs. Sting, Booker T, Goldberg, Kronik - This wasn't the traditional two ringed War Games match as this match took place in one ring but three different structures as they used the triple layered cage that was seen in the ""Ready To Rumble"" movie & months earlier at Slamboree. The World Title was to be hung at the top of the third cage with the object of the match being for someone to climb the three cages & get the belt only to come back down with it & the person who actually walks out of the cage with the title is the champion. This match had multiple stories being told such as Kevin Nash having issues with Russo (and his own team members) for not only booking this match but stating himself that he wanted to be the World Champion along with Nash's strategy throughout the match only pushing his mentality of being ""the smartest man in wrestling"", the issues so many had with Vince Russo including one guy who wasn't even legally in the match, the return of a WCW superstar who hadn't been seen in months, and another appearance of a WCW superstar who had his own grudge with Goldberg. This was a match that was pretty much all over the place but was still very entertaining.
Sept. 00

Sting vs. Ric Flair - They wrestled on the first Nitro & this was the final match on the last Nitro. Both men tried going out & having fun which you could clearly see they both exchanged smiles at one point but anyone who watched the Ric Flair documentary knows that he stated that he was out of shape (hence wearing a T-shirt) & neither guy had wrestled in months so they weren't at their best here as we saw at one point that Flair was unable to do his top rope flip. This wasn't their best encounter but definitely far from the worst but is very important in the history of Nitro for this being the final match in the original WCW.
Mar. 01

(F.Y.E. Edition) Crusierweight Champion Rey Mysterio vs. J.L. - Both men were evenly matched early on with Mysterio using his lucha libre aerial offense from different positions from a springboard & to the top rope while Lynn was working a more grounded game working over the back area with submissions along with taking some shortcuts while one man who had a vested interest looked on in what was a competitive match but more significant for what was going on backstage involving the nWo that the camera kept cutting away to.
Aug. 96

There are no DVD extras on the regular version but the other extras on the F.Y.E. edition feature DDP showcasing his career highlights on the show & talking about the time Sting took him up in the rafters.

DDP said it best at the end of this when he made it clear that you couldn't possibly shove 6 years of history into 3 disc & WWE would never be able to come out with a set that makes everyone happy but I still question some of the choices made here as far as memories & matches such as DDP's matches against both Bagwell & Kidman weren't relevant to anything in WCW history so I'm thinking they only put those on here because DDP was hosting the set while I would have also preferred the full Arn Anderson retirement speech instead of the nWo's spoof the next week & maybe even Goldberg's U.S. title win. Either way they got a bunch of the memories I have from Nitro in moments & matches while having a small amount of repeats that I didn't mind so this is a DVD set to add to the collection.",1403568000,,22718,4.451682692307692

6034968,5,B00FWVXRNE,"It started in September of 1995 and quickly took over the WWE as the king of monday nights in the wrestling world. From bringing in former WWE talent, to the influx of crusierweight wrestlers from all over the world to the New World Order, the highs just seemed to keep coming. Of course eventually there were cracks in the armor and from mid 1999 to the closing in March of 2001 what was once a suprise filled 3 hour show filled with great action and great angles was reduced to being stale, tired and boring.

This is a 3-disc set of great moments and matches from WCW's flaghsip show Monday Nitro, hosted by former 3 time WCW World Champion Diamond Dallas Page he doesn't just read from a script here as whenever he appears he gives his honest opnions on what was going on in WCW and the world of wrestling at various times during the sets.

Personally I loved the video package they played to begin the disc, brought back some great and not so great memories.

Disc 1-The Rise and Takeover

-9/4/95, Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger vs. ""Flyin"" Brian Pillman: From the Mall of America its the very first match ever on Nitro and despite a few botched moves its a very good contest, though their '92 contest was better. Brian rolls up Liger and pins him. 7/10.

-9/4/95, WCW Championship Match, Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Big Bubba: The first main event in Nitro's history and in typical Hogan fashion he sells for Bubba and hits his usual spots including the big boot and leg drop for the win. Average match, 5/10. The face/off between Lex Luger and Hogan afterwards was fun to see, except Luger sounded stupid as always when he cut a promo.

-1/8/96, Ric Flair & Arn Anderson vs. Hulk Hogan & Randy Savage: What a star studded main event tag match this is. Its quite good as there's a good face/off between Hogan and Flair and both Anderson and Savage get good spots in. Flair and Arn cut off the ring and wear Savage down before Hogan gets the tag. Hogan hits the leg drop on Arn and pins him. 8/10. The aftermath where The Giant chokeslams both Hogan and Savage is pretty good.

-2/5/96, WCW Tag Team Title Match, Sting & Lex Luger (Champions) vs. The Road Warriors: Hawk and Animal returned shortly before this match and didn't look like they had missed a step and the champs weren't far behind them. The match itself isn't bad, lots of power moves from all the guys. There was some underlying tension between Sting & Luger as Lex was using some dirty tactics that Sting didn't approve of. Lex hit Animal with a weight lifting plate and covered Animal to keep the tag titles. 7/10.

-4/29/96, Parking Lot Brawl, Belfast Bruiser vs. Lord Steven Regal: Pretty hard hitting match where these two hit each other off of cars with Bruiser even hitting Regal with a bumper and a couple of windows get shattered when Bruiser hits them. Regal hits a piledriver on the roof of the car and pins Bruiser to win the match. This was a very enjoyable contest. 8/10.

-5/20/96, Ric Flair vs. Eddie Guerrero: Quite a good contest here, good counter wrestling and Flair made Eddie look great, while Guerrero showed he could hang with a main eventer. Ric locked on the figure four and had to resort to using the ropes and Eddie ended up getting counted down for the three count. Great match, 9/10.

-5/27/96, Scott Hall's Nitro Debut: We see Hall come in through the crowd, get in the ring and cut a promo which planted the seeds for the upcoming NWO storyline. Good segment.

-6/10/96, Kevin Nash's Nitro Debut: Scott Hall comes down to the announce booth and while Bischoff's back is turned Nash appears and he cuts a promo saying they're prepared to go to war.

-6/24/96, Triple Threat Match For The WCW Tag Team Titles, Sting & Lex Luger (Champions) vs. Harlem Heat vs. The Steiner Brothers: Interesting match here, the pistons didn't seem to fire right away but once they did the teams worked well together. This one is more remembered for Hall & Nash coming to ringside and security comes down to protect the WCW wrestlers, but during the chaos Luger gets rolled up by Booker T for the 3 count and Harlem Heat are the new Tag Team champions. 6/10.

-7/8/96, The New World Order Takes Over: The night after Bash At The Beach where Hogan, Hall & Nash formed the NWO we hear from Hogan as he talks about how they will take over and destroy WCW.

-7/29/96, Backstage Chaos: Jimmy Hart runs to ringside and gets Sting, Savage and Luger to come to the back. We see Hall & Nash beating up wrestlers in the back including Rey Mysterio being thrown head first into a trailer. This actually felt pretty real even for a wrestling show.

-8/12/96, Scott Hall & Kevin Nash vs. Sting & Lex Luger: Starts off with Luger taking on both men, then Sting blind sides Nash & Hall and we have more of a brawl than anything else. 6/10. What this is remembered for is the beginning of referee Nick Patrick joining the NWO. The horsemen run down and run the Outsiders off.

-8/26/96, Taking Over: We see the final couple of minutes of Sting/Luger vs. McMichael/Benoit, (yes I said Benoit), the NWO comes down and Hogan brands McMichael, Sting and Benoit. The Horsemen come down but they get taken out. Good segment where the fans throw more stuff into the ring and at the NWO.

-9/9/96, The Turncoat Sting?: Luger gets called to the back by referee Nick Patrick and we hear from a limo Sting telling Ted DiBiase he needs to take Luger out. Sting appears out of the limo and he and the NWO beat up Luger in the rain.

-9/16/96, Vindication: The real Sting appears one night after the War Games match the night before where he was thought to have joined the NWO. He proved he was not a traitor that night and here in the ring he says those who doubted him can stick it. Great segment.

-11/18/96, Easy E's Reign Begins: Piper comes out, the crowd goes nuts and he confronts Bischoff. We get the usual ramblings from Roddy and this leads to the NWO coming down and it being revealed that Bischoff is part of the group. Very well done segment.

-12/30/96, Rey Mysterio vs. Dean Malenko: A very good rivalry in '96 that continues on the final Nitro of the year. Its short but very good moves by both men. We do seem some actual mat wrestling from Mysterio along with his high flying moves. Dean uses some wear down offense including working on Rey's knee. There was a 10 minute time limit that expired so that match is declared a draw. 7/10.

Extras

-8/29/96, Rey Mysterio vs. Mr. JL: Good match here, JL is Jerry Lynn (pre-ECW), its quite good given the short time its given. Rey ends up taking this one with a springboard hurricarana. 8/10. A good NWO moment where Hogan, Hall and Nash spray paint the production truck is also shown during the match.

-Diamond Dallas Page Monday Nitro Highlights: A montage of his best moments on Nitro, good extra here.

-6/9/97, Afraid of Heights: DDP is interviewed where he talks about how Sting saved him and took him up into the rafters. Pretty cool extra here.

Disc 2: The Peak and Plateau

-1/13/97, DDP vs. Mark Starr: This is a fairly quick squash that sees DDP hit the Diamond Cutter and cover Starr for the win. The aftermath is much better than the match as Hall and Nash come down to recruit DDP to the NWO, but while Nash's back is turned DDP hits Hall with the Diamond Cutter much to the crowds delight. He then ducks and Nash goes out of the ring almost sending a table into the crowd, DDP then celebrates going through the fans as they cheer.

-3/3/97, Suspended: Eric Bischoff comes out and cuts a promo talking about how the NWO is the reason they are all here in this arena. Harvey Schiller the president of Turner Sports comes out and after a couple of minutes he suspends Bischoff, which as the crowd going nuts.

-3/17/97, From The Rafters: As the Steiners and Harlem Heat are having a match, the entire NWO comes down and destroys all four men. Luger and The Giant come down and clear the ring. Some pyro goes off in the rafters then Sting decends from the ceiling and the crowd goes nuts and I mean nuts. He gets up on the second rope and points his bat at Hogan who looks absolutely terrified.

-4/21/97, WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match, Rey Mysterio vs. Syxx: Not a bad one here, Syxx had Nash at ringside and Rey seemed a little more agressive than usual. Rey almost has the title won, when Nash interferes and Jacknifes Rey, Syxx locks on the crossface chicken wing and the ref calls for the bell. 6/10. Post match sees a fan run into the ring and get kicked by Syxx and Rey is carted to the back and put in an ambulance.

-8/4/97, WCW Championship Match: Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Lex Luger: Its Hogan vs. the man the NWA and WCW believed could be the next Hogan, Lex Luger. Power for power here, Hogan wears down Luger in the early going with kicks, fists and clotheslines, in fact besides a small flurry by Luger, Hogan dominates the first part of this match, having him pinned down but not out a few times. Luger does kick out of the Hogan leg drop, then makes his comeback, taking out the interfering members of the NWO. He slaps on the Torture Rack and Hogan gives up. Winner and new WCW Champion, Lex Luger. 6/10. The crowd went absolutely nuts for the finish and various WCW stars come out to celebrate with Luger.

-9/1/97, The NWO Parody: This was the infamous mockery of Arn Anderson's retirement speech, where the NWO well mainly Nash, Konnan, Syxx and Buff Bagwell mock the Four Horsemen. Its stupid in parts but I found parts of it funny. Being a fan of the Horsemen like I was it was a little much to watch the whole thing.

-9/29/97, Buff Bagwell vs. DDP: Pretty decent one here as Bagwell's ego come back to bite him as DDP makes his comeback, Vincent interferes and gets the Diamond Cutter and then one for Bagwell right after, DDP makes the cover and wins. 6/10.

-10/27/97, Hulk Hogan vs. DDP: Here we see the final few minutes with Hogan beating up on DDP, but no matter how hard he tries DDP just won't stay down. The NWO runs down and beats up on DDP, Sting makes his way through the crowd and beats up the NWO.

-2/2/98, Sting vs. Randy Savage: Pretty good but short match here, with two of the all time greats. Sting takes it to Savage early on before Randy turns it around beating on the Stinger. When Savage actually had Sting down after the elbow drop, Hogan stops the pinfall causing a DQ. 7/10. Luger comes down and runs off Savage, the NWO gets run off and Hogan follows to avoid facing Sting.

-3/30/98, 1,004 Holds: Chris Jericho cuts a promo where he talks about how he knows more moves than Dean Malenko. Its an entertaining segment with Chris in his heel stage. Funny stuff.

-7/6/98: WCW Championship Match, Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Goldberg: With 43,000 plus in the Georgia Dome on hand, this match saw the mega launch of Goldberg as he beat Hogan for the WCW World Title with the spear and jackhammer. Major, major league pop for the finish, though the re-dubbing of the music with Goldberg's WWE music was pretty annoying. 8/10.

-7/20/98, WCW Tag Team Championship Match, Kevin Nash & Sting (Champions) vs. Scott Hall & The Giant: Its not a bad tag team match, but this was more about Nash wanting to get his hands on his former best friend Hall. There's a good face/off between Nash and Giant. While Sting has Hall down, Bret Hart interferes, Hall hits the Outsider Edge on Sting from the top rope and he covers Sting to win the tag team titles. 7/10.

-8/3/98, Chris Jericho vs. Rey Mysterio: Jericho was the Cruiserweight champion but this was a non-title match, but also a very good one too as these two have rarely had an off match. Rey was in revenge mode as Jericho had injured him several months back and just recently cost him a title shot at Hog Wild. With the referee down and Rey having Jericho pinned, Dean Malenko came down and counted Chris out, so Rey wins. 8/10.

-9/14/98, WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match, Juventud Guerrera (Champion) vs. Billy Kidman: This was right after Kidman and everyone else had walked away from Raven, thus disbanding The Flock. Its actually a very good match and shows why fans loved the cruiserweight wrestlers as both men just go all out. Kidman hits the Shooting Star Press to win the title, great match. 9/10.

-9/14/98, Ric Flair Returns to WCW: Great emotional segment that saw the return of Ric Flair. Nice promo by Arn Anderson and great promo by Flair. The tension between Flair and Bischoff felt so real mainly cause almost all of it was. There was a major, major, major pop for Flair when he came out to the ring. Best segment on the DVD in my opinion.

-10/26/98, United States Championship Match, Bret Hart (Champion) vs. DDP: The night after DDP almost won the world title from Goldberg, he has the chance to beat Hart for the U.S. title. Bret was a lot dirtier in his tactics as he uses the ropes during some submission holds and cheats to gain the advantage. DDP does make a comeback and when Bret misses with a loaded punch, he gets the Diamond Cutter and DDP covers to win the U.S. title. 8/10. Afterwards Bret uses a chair to destroy DDP's leg and he locks on the sharpshooter, Goldberg runs down and Bret leaves.

-12/28/98, Ric Flair vs. Eric Bischoff: For the control of WCW, we have a segment/match, Bischoff tries to leave but the Horsemen (Benoit again included) carry him to the ring and Flair beats up on Eric. The NWO and the Horsemen brawl around the ring, The Giant comes down and goes to chokeslam Flair, but Savage comes to the ring, hits a lowblow on Giant and leaves the ring. Ric slaps on the figure four and Bischoff gives up. 7/10.

Disc 3: The Fall and the End

-1/4/99, WCW Championship Match, Kevin Nash (Champion) vs. Hulk Hogan: Boy did WCW build this up during the show and during the entrances, it had such a big main event feel. Unfortunately this featured the finger poke of doom, where Hogan barely touched Nash who fell down and Hogan covered him to win the title. Such a waste, but honestly kind of a fun segment, so 7/10 as a segment. Goldberg runs into the arena to get revenge but he gets beaten down and thus began the downfall of WCW. It did get a great reaction from the crowd though.

-3/29/99, How To Stop The Spear: In Toronto, Canada, Bret Hart cuts a promo in the ring that has the crowd hanging on his every word. Its a very good, real emotional speech by the Hitman. Goldberg comes down and spears Hart, but he's knocked out, Bret stands up and takes off his jersey to reveal a metal plate. He then tells Bischoff he quits. What a great segment.

-4/26/99, WCW Championship Match, DDP (Champion) vs. Sting: This is the definition of a great title match, both guys really bring their A-games and there are plenty of close calls. Sting blocks a Diamond Cutter and hits the Scorpion Death Drop to win the title. 9/10.

-6/21/99, Eddie Guerrero vs. Juventud Guerrera: It was Eddie's first match on Nitro since his car accident months back and while not great it was quite good as Eddie was more agressive than normal while he showed very little ring rust and Juvi did get some high spots in as well. Its always great to see Eddie in the ring as his WCW stuff was very underrated by the company. Eddie wins after hitting the frog splash in a good comeback match. 8/10.

-8/9/99, Sting, Goldberg & Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash, Sid Vicious & Rick Steiner: For the first time in over 3 years Hogan returned to the traditional colors of red and yellow, which had the crowd going nuts and thats what this match is most remembered for. Its not a bad six-man tag match, though I don't understand what Rick Steiner is doing with all these main eventers, nothing against him but he doesn't seem to belong here. Hogan, Goldberg and Sting hit their usual moves, Hogan hits Sid and Nash with a chair, Sting locks on the Scorpion Death Lock on Nash and the referee calls for the bell. 7/10.

--8/16/99, Billy Kidman vs. DDP: It starts as an interview where at one point Kidman mentions DDP's wife, which brings DDP down to the ring and he starts to beat on Kidman. This turns into a pretty good match as Kidman takes a beating but just won't quit. DDP even had Kidman down but pulls him up before the 3 count a couple of times. DDP goes for the Diamond Cutter but gets rolled up by Kidman for 3 in a bit of a shocking upset. 7/10. Great aftermath where DDP hits the Diamond Cutter on the referee and then on Kidman.

-12/20/99, Match For The Vacated WCW Championship, Bill Goldberg vs. Bret Hart: The previous night at Starrcade Bret had suffered a concussion that would lead to the end of his in ring career and while he did well that it was quite obvious that he was a bit off. Good match though that sees Hall and Nash come down and beat Goldberg with baseball bats, soon Bret joins in the beating, Piper comes down to protect Goldberg. Bret covers Goldberg to win the title. 7/10. Jeff Jarrett comes down and hits Piper with the guitar and we see the rebirth of the NWO.

-1/24/00, Match For The Vacated WCW Championship, Sid Vicious vs. ""Commisioner"" Kevin Nash: Power for power here and both men try and the crowd cheers for Sid but its not really that good of a match. Each guy does hit some impressive moves, though Nash wearing Sid down with a sleeper is a bit of a downer in the pacing of the match. Jeff Jarrett interferes but gets knocked out, Sid hits Nash with the guitar and pins him to win the world title. 5/10.

-4/10/00, The Bischoff & Russo Era Begins: Everyone on the roster was around the ring, Russo talked about change, Bischoff comes down and does excellent mic work especially when he rips Sting, Luger and Sid. Russo and Bischoff say they're rebooting the company, thus everyone is stripped of their titles. This started the New Blood/Veterans angle that ran for a while. Its a pretty good piece in the history of WCW, though it is quite a long segment.

-4/24/00, Steel Cage Match For The WCW Championship, Jeff Jarrett (Champion) vs. DDP: Not a great cage match honestly but not horrible, though there is some nice brawling on the outside before both men enter the cage. There's some good action and some interference by Mike Awesome but Kaynon stops him and DDP covers Jarrett for the win to become a 3-time champion. 6/10.

-7/18/00, Six Man Tag Team Ladder Match, 3 Count vs. The Jung Dragons: We open with former MMA fighter Tank Abbott introducing 3 Count who bring a ladder to the ring. Basically the idea is to climb the ladder and get 3 Count's gold record. Its not very long though there are a couple of brutal falls from the ladder, including Shannon Moore getting a huge suplex from Jamie Noble. Evan climbs the ladder gets launched out of the ring, and looks like he wrenches his ankle badly. Jamie climbs the ladder and grabs the gold record to win. 6/10, cause it was so short.

-8/7/00, WCW Championship Match, Booker T (Champion) vs. Lance Storm: Horrible commentary by Mike Awesome who had one of the worst gimmicks ever in wrestling history and that covers a lot of ground. This was during Lance's best run in WCW as he had three titles and was going for the big one, but standing in his way was Booker T. Its not a bad match at least Booker and Storm try hard. But its fairly basic as Booker fights out of the Canadian Maple Leaf and hits the Book End to make the cover and retain his title. 6/10.

-9/4/00, Triple Cage War Games Match for the WCW Championship, Sting vs. Scott Steiner vs. Kevin Nash vs. Jeff Jarrett vs. Booker T vs. Kronik vs. Goldberg vs. Vince Russo: Every 2 minutes a man comes into the match and honestly I don't know how to call this match. The idea is you have to climb up to the second cage, then the third one, grab the title belt then make it back into the first cage and out the door with the title in hand. Confusing? Somewhat, Sloppy? Yes, Badly booked? Absolutely. It is a tad fun for being a confusing mess, there's some good weapons used, the Harris Brothers also make an appearance on behalf of Vince Russo. Near the end, Goldberg is about to walk out with the title when Bret Hart comes through the crowd and kicks the door in Goldbergs face. Nash walks out with the title in hand along with his buddies, Jarrett, Steiner and Russo. 5/10.

-3/26/01, Vince Buys WCW: We get the promo from Vince McMahon on Raw where he announces he has bought WCW, which didn't need to be on here as we already know that he won the war.

-3/26/01, Sting vs. Ric Flair: Not their best encounter but it certainly was emotional given that this was the final Nitro ever. They did have some good back and forth action, though Flair was very blown up as he hadn't wrestled in months and he was wrestling with a shirt on which he never did. Sting nails a superplex and locks on the Scorpion Death Lock and Flair gives up. 6/10. When these two hugged and shook hands afterwards it was a very emotional moment.

Its certainly some of the best and some of the worst moments and matches from Monday Nitro's history and it was certainly a great time capsule. DDP was also a very refreshing host on this DVD. I think I can safely say this is a worthy purchase for anyone's wrestling library, I know I'm happy I bought it.",1313971200,35,21134,4.450219808637186
6034969,4,B00FWVXRNE,This was a good DVD with alot of the glory days of Nitro. I only hope there is a volume 2. Good for old fans to relive those days and for new fans to see what they missed.,1313020800,,171,3.526315789473684
6034970,1,B00FWVXRNE,"I will only be reviewing the main 2 hour feature of the DVD since I saw it Netflix and didn't buy it.  However, this is probably the worst ""Very Best Of"" DVD I have ever seen in my 25 years of living.  How can you make a very best of DVD of Monday Nitro and leave out many NWO moments?  The NWO was mainly responsible for putting Nitro ahead of Raw and all that is shown is when Scott Hall and Kevin Nash arrived and Hogan's interview the night after he turned.  Epic moments like the street fight with the NWO where Nash torpedoed Rey Mysterio's head into the bunker and the countless surprise turns of people joining the NWO (with the exception of Bret Hart) are non-existent.  Another huge group that was a huge part of nitro and was not on the DVD was the Four Horsemen.  I will never forget that moment where The Four Horsemen returned and Ric Flair cut a shoot promo on Eric Bischoff.  Or how about when Alondra Blaze jumped ship to WCW and threw the WWE Women's title into the trash can on Nitro?  All these great moments are not on this DVD.  Instead it is packed with matches we probably might not even remember (with the exception of Hogan vs. Goldberg and Flair vs. Sting on the final nitro).  And speaking of the final Nitro, you would think they would put in the pivotal moment/announcement where Shane McMahon comes out and announces his acquisition of WCW.  Instead, DDP (this host of the dvd) just mentions it in passing.

In conclusion, don't buy this horrible dvd.  If you wanna re-live some mediocre moments of Nitro though, stream it for free on Netflix.",1312675200,3,1574,4.404844290657439
6034971,4,B00FWVXRNE,"Diamond Dallas Page, a famous WCw star who hosts thois enthralling three-disc set, says towards the end, ""I can just imagine the Internet will blow up when they see everything isn't on here,"" almost anticipating the inevitable backlash.

I hate to be one of those smarks, but that's the most glaring thing about this set,. When the matches are over and it's all said and done, I was left wondering, ""that's it?"" There's some good matches and historical moments on here, but not enough to introduce them or wave them together. If you're looking for a more narrative DVD, I'd suggest checking out the infamous ""Monday Night Wars"" or ""rie and fall of wCW"" sets. This is more for fans who just ant straight-up matches (nothing wrong with that).

That being said, I don't intend this to be a negative review. On the contrary, I got my money's worth. The 1st disc is the best, imo. Pillman and Liger start things off right and you get the Hogan era. The 2nd disc is a bit NWO-heavy; yes, tyhey were an integral part of the comopany's history but there was other stuff going on at the time, like Raven, Jericho, and the luchadors. The 3rd disc is necessary for history lessons but....DDP and Jarrett in a cage match? C'mon.

I'd recommend this for hardcore wrestling fans or those who miss WCW. A nice trip down memory lane (not Lenny), even if some omissions are head-scratching.",1312156800,,1373,4.618852459016393
6034972,5,B00FWVXRNE,"Noone can argue that the mid 1990's were the greatest for professional wrestling. WCW was my favorite company (I was just a kid) But the lighting was better, stage was better, pyro was better, clearly WCW used their money to make the appearcne of the show much better than WWE. Great flashback to the greates time of my life (wrestling wise)

The DVD however does miss a few things. Such as the biggest moment in wrestling history...Hulk Hogans heel turn., more of the cruseirwights and such. But it is still a fantastic collection, could easily be a 5 Disc set or even 10. Alot of stuff was left out.",1311724800,,601,4.513761467889908
6034973,4,B00FWVXRNE,"This is a awesome dvd with some great moments from WCW Nitro history, but it also has some questionable ones. Events like Bischoff and Russo taking away all the belts and the title match with Russo. The first dvd is all great, classic WCW moments from the first appearance of Hall and Nash to the reformation of the 4 Horsemen. The second dvd seems to mostly focus on the decline years of Nitro. I wish there would have been interviews with people from the Attitude Era to give their thoughts on Nitro, but i guess its been done to death in the Monday Night Wars dvd and The Rise and Decline of WCW. All in all though, a good dvd for any 90s wrestling fan.",1310601600,,656,4.256
6034974,3,B00FWVXRNE,"Nostalgia was running wild when I purchased this item...then when you watch it, the nostalgia dies quickly.  I was always a fan of WCW back in the day, but I always favored the WWF at the time.  When I would watch WCW, i would do the channel flip when WWF would advertise, much like everyone did (this was pre-dvr), but I remember when I did flip channels, a lot of WCW's stuff kept me tuned in way past WWF's commercial break ended.....unfortunately when watching this, the magic seem's gone.

The few great matches are overwhelmed with the lackluster NWO segments.  I know the NWO was important to WCW's success, but the crowds were absolutely dead during some of these (Four Horseman Parody is a good example...crowd was dead, and this wasn't funny), which begs to question why they are on here.  Because the NWO was such a big factor to WCW's success, they gloss over many great aspects that made WCW what it was, like the cruiser weights; They showcase Rey Mysterio, and Jericho heavily, seem to bypass everyone else completely (we get 2 Eddie Guerrero matches, 1 Dean Malenko match, which seem's to only be on here because Rey Mysterio is his opponent).  Hell, they even gloss over the whole Raven's Flock storyline, and NWO Wolfpac.

I tuned in to WCW for the cruiser weights, and the NwO, as well as Raven's Flock, and what we get is some not-so classic moments from the NwO, and cruiser weight matches that only feature WWE alumni.  I hope they make another set, or atleast make a WCW cruiser weight only disc; to only feature WWE alumni and skip over such greats as Alex Wright, Psychosis, Ultimo Dragon, hell...even the Disco Inferno is kind of a shame.",1310342400,,1664,4.6169491525423725
6034975,5,B00FWVXRNE,"Disc 1:

Flyin' Brian Pillman vs. Jushin Thunder Liger
4th September, 1995
Significant because it was the very first match ever featured on Nitro.  Pretty good back on forth action for the time.  Not too much to elaborate on.  6/10

Hulk Hogan vs. Big Bubba Rogers
4th September, 1995
Like the match above, this was featured simply because it was the first main event on Nitro.  This was a very typical mid 90's Hogan match.  Big Bubba was noticeably overweight and seemed to get winded quickly.  It was a fun watch, with the crowd coming alive when Hogan began his traditional antics at the end.  The post match was a fun watch too with the Hogan - Luger confrontation.  5.5/10

""Macho Man"" Randy Savage & Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair & Arn Anderson
8th January, 1996
This match was a definite step up from the previous two.  It had the fun element to watch, but also all four men really seemed to put in a good effort here.  Really good match here from all four.  7/10

WCW World Tag Team Championship Match
Sting and Lex Luger vs. The Road Warriors
5th February, 1996
Solid match here.  Warriors were a little stiff and slow and the two teams seemed to have a bit of trouble clicking at times.  Towards the last couple of minutes they seemed to find their rythm.  5.75/10

Parking Lot Brawl
Lord Steven Regal vs. Belfast Bruiser
29th April, 1996
The word ""brawl"" in the title is used literally here.  This is two stiff, great wrestlers beating each other down on top of cars in a parking lot.  The first half of the match is alot of back and forth hard, stiff brawling, but the second half really incorporates some good spots.  Some really cool suplexes, slams, and elbow drops on cards.  6.5/10

Eddie Guerrero vs. Ric Flair
20th May, 1996
I really enjoyed this match.  It's pretty much self explanatory.  Two great wrestlers, Flair still in great condition vs a young and quick Eddie.  Good action and nice psychology by two good ones.  7/10

WCW World Tag Team Championship Triangle Match
Sting & Lex Luger vs. The Steiner Brother vs. Harlem Heat
24th June, 1996
This three-way was an excellent step up from the previous Sting & Luger vs Road Warriors match previously featured.  This was a really good showing.  Fast paced action from all three teams.  This is one of the reasons I love the DVD so much, hidden gems like this that you would otherwise forget about forever.  7.5/10

Sting & Lex Luger vs. The Outsiders Scott Hall & Kevin Nash
12th August, 1996
Pretty good showing here, but rather short.  A match of this caliber was a really big deal on Nitro at the time, though it was really just used to advance the budding nWo vs WCW storyline.  6.5/10

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Dean Malenko
30th December, 1996
Good match here, similiar to the Flair vs Eddie match from earlier.  WCW was known for great showings from their strong midcard wrestlers and cruiserweights, this was no exception.  7/10

There were quite a few great segments on Disc one featuring the nWo, WCW, Hall, Nash, Sting, ""Sting"", Luger, and Bischoff.  I chose not to review them all, but they are all 100% great.  They brought back so many fun memories of watching Nitro, but on top of that they are really well done.  10/10 for all segments.

Disc 2:

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Mark Starr
13th January, 1997
The match is really nothing, lasting all of 3 minutes.  It was fun to watch a young DDP again.  The crowd hangs on his every move.  The post match is awesome, with Hall and Nash coming out to confront DDP about joining the nWo.  It was things like this that really made you want to tune into Nitro every Monday night and made that WCW vs nWo feud so great.  8/10

WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match
Syxx vs. Rey Mysterio Jr.
21st April, 1997
Excellent match.  Rey has always been great, but I forgot how quick and agile he used to be in the early days.  Syxx really showed up here also.  I forgot that he was once a great worker.  Fun interference by Nash.  Great WCW vs nWo stuff.  8/10

WCW World Heavyweight Championship Match
Hollywood Hulk Hogan vs. Lex Luger
4th August, 1997
This was a huge deal at the time.  Luger vs Hogan for free on the main event of Nitro.  This was a typical WCW veteran main event match from the time, which wasn't a bad thing.  Great crowd participation.  For what these two lacked in ""technical ability"", they made up for with the fun factor in this match.  Good stuff.  7/10

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Buff Bagwell
29th September, 1997
Good effort and match by both guys in this match.  Mid-Nitro matches like this that are easily forgotten is what makes this DVD great.  Bagwell was always a bit underrated and this showing with the hard working DDP shows why.  6.5/10

Sting vs. ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage
2nd February, 1998
It's shorter than it should be for a billing of this caliber on the main event of Nitro, but it is great for the length that it lasted.  The crowd is super hot for this big time clash.  Lots of interference in this wild match towards the end.  Macho and Sting went really hard for the time they were alloted.  8.5/10

WCW World Heavyweight Championship Match
Hollywood Hulk Hogan vs. Goldberg
6th July, 1998
Awesome stuff for the time.  Like the Luger vs Hogan match, for what it lacked in ""technica expertise"" it more than made up for in ""it"" factor.  Absolute loudest and hottest crowd there may have ever been at a wrestling event.  When Goldberg gains momentum towards the end, they grow louder and louder and eventually reach a frenzy at the end.  The final two minutes is worth the watch of the whole match.  8/10

WCW World Tag Team Championship Match
Kevin Nash & Sting vs. Scott Hall & The Giant
20th July, 1998
Another hot crowd with four guys that had the ""it"" factor.  Common thing here with these big time WCW matches - just fun with guys who are good at what they do.  Good action back and forth.  7/10

WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match
Juventud Guerrera vs. Billy Kidman
14th September, 1998
This is 100% what the WCW cruiserweight division was all about!  Fantastic match.  Crowd ate it up.  These two guys were really talented and this match let them shine.  They really did a good job pacing too, as this match gets bigger and faster as it goes on.  9/10

Ric Flair Returns to the Four Horsemen
14th September, 1998
I'm not reviewing specific segments, but this one is too great not to at least mention.  Unbelievable emotions shown, crowd that is going nuts, excellent promos all around.  Crazy good.  10/10

WCW United States Championship Match
Bret ""Hitman"" Hart vs. Diamond Dallas Page
26th October, 1998
Bret is obviously an all time great and DDP always worked with everything he had.  Really solid match here with somewhat of a surprise ending.  8.25/10

Ric Flair vs. Eric Bischoff
28th December, 1998
Short and Sweet.  Really more of a segment than a match.  Good, fun stuff though.  Tons of wrestlers make appearances in this one.  Once again, hot crowd.  8/10

Segments:  Once again there were a few segments with the nWo, Jericho, Sting, etc. that I did not review.  They are all great and always worth a look.  10/10

Disc 3:

WCW World Heavyweight Championship Match
Kevin Nash vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan
4th January, 1999
This is 98% segment and 2% match.  The atmosphere around it is huge though and the crowd is going nuts.  It is a fun reminder of how huge a potential matchup like this was.  Bear in mind I'm reviewing this as a segment:  8.5/10

Goldberg Spears The Hitman
29th March, 1999
Another segment I am reviewing.  This is great, maybe my favorite segment of the DVD.  Bret cuts a 7 minute promo, which may be the best of his career.  As he looks at the camera, you are literally hanging on to every word he speaks.  The Canadian crowd can not get enough of anything Bret does.  Goldberg finally comes out for a VERY climactic ending.  10/10

WCW World Heavyweight Championship Match
Sting vs. Diamond Dallas Page
26th April, 1999
In my opinion, this is the best match on the entire three disc set.  This could be the best match of DDP's career.  Sting and DDP went all out for around 14 minutes.  They went as hard as they could and had some really awesome false finishes and ring psychology.  10/10

Eddie Guerrero vs. Juventud Guerrera
21st June, 1999
This match was a bit of a disappointment.  This significance of this match on this DVD is that this was Eddie's return match from his near-career ending car wreck.  Eddie showed no rust and Juvi is always great, but these two just seemed to have a bit of trouble clicking at moments.  5.5/10

Hulk Hogan & Goldberg & Sting vs. Kevin Nash & Sid Vicious & Rick Steiner
9th August, 1999
Good stuff, fun match.  It had been over three years, but Hogan finally returned to the red and yellow.  That's why this match if featured on this DVD.  From a historical standpoint, it should have been bigger than it was, but WCW was starting to fade in ratings at this point, so it wasn't quite built up like it needed to be.  The match is good stuff though.  The faces dominate the majority of the match.  They hit their big moves and the crowd likes it.  Good trip down memory lane.  7/10

Billy Kidman vs. Diamond Dallas Page
16th August, 1999
What starts as a really good segment, ends up as an even better match.  Great back and forth impromptu match.  Excellent false finishes and hard hitting action.  The crowd grows to a frenzy towards the end.  The post match is great too.  8.5/10

WCW World Heavyweight Championship Match
Bret ""Hitman"" Hart vs. Goldberg
20th December, 1999
This match took place the night after they wrestled at Starrcade and Bret received his career ending kick to the head.  You can tell Bret is not 100% on top of his game here, but the match is still pretty captivating.  The ending was the birth of the nWo 2000.  7.5/10

WCW World Heavyweight Championship Match
Kevin Nash vs. Sid Vicious
24th January, 2000
Very short match.  Too short for a title to change hands.  Around 5 minutes long.  Crowd really tries to like it and get behind Sid, which helps the match.  A few good power moves, not alot in between though.  Helped that it was so short.  Good ending.  5.5/10

The Bischoff & Russo Era Begins
10th April, 2000
Segment review.  I really enjoyed this segment.  From a WCW history standpoint, this was big stuff.  The entire roster enters the arena for this one.  This was the genesis of the new blood vs veterans feud, as everyone was stripped of their titles and the company was rebooted.  Great mic work by Bischoff.  9.5/10

Steel Cage Match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship Match
Jeff Jarrett vs. Diamond Dallas Page
24th April, 2000
This was a short match, but what they packed into it was really fun and action packed.  It starts off as a brawl around the cage and up to the stage, but eventually fight into the cage for the back and forth match.  Loaded with interference towards the end, which adds to the drama.  I enjoyed this quite a bit.  7.5/10

Tag Team Ladder Match
3 Count vs. Jung Dragons
18th July, 2000
I was hoping for way better from this match.  The 3-way ladder match they had from Starrcade blew this one out of the water.  It is super short, around 4 minutes, and comes across as more of a segment than a match.  A couple of quick spots, that are good, but aren't enough to make a match.  5.5/10

WCW World Heavyweight Championship Match
Booker T. vs. Lance Storm
7th August, 2000
I've reviewed this match before, on the Rise and Fall of WCW DVD.  It's a really solid Nitro match and a good pick to switch things up.  Most people look back on WCW's 2000 year with bad memories, but there were some really good things going on.  Booker T as Champion and Lance Storm running the table with midcard titles were good things.  These two were at the prime of their careers during this match and  brought solid match skills to the table.  I think if they had been allowed to go 15 or 20 minutes, they could have put together an all time classic.  The 7 minute match we are given though is really solid for what it is.  7/10

Triple Cage War Games Match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship
4th September, 2000
People in this match and simply involved in this match include:  Sting, Scott Steiner, Jeff Jarrett, Vince Russo, Booker T, Kevin Nash, Kronik, Harris Brothers, Goldberg, and even Brett Hart makes a quick cameo.  It is pure chaos from the opening bell.  It's war games style, with a new man (or men) coming out every two minutes and fighting to the top of a cage three stories high.  This match is a giant brawl with a couple of dramatic turns.  Lots and lots of weapons shots all over the cage.  They brawl up and down and there's even a few wrestling moves scattered in between.  It's not classic, but it's a match that when you read the premise, you've got to tune in.  It's a fun bit of chaos and it definitely keeps your attention for the full 15 minutes.  With that many big names in that atmosphere, it's got to be worth watching.  8/10

Sting vs. Ric Flair
26th March, 2001
This last meeting ever between Sting and Flair is also the last match ever in WCW history.  That alone gives you reason to watch this match.  It's short, around the 8 minute mark, and they give everything they have in those short 8 minutes.  This match flies during this match as it is non stop from the opening bell.  You can see the emotion on their faces as they try to squeeze something good into the small time alloted to them.  7.5/10

There are only two segments on this disc and I reviewed them both.

This DVD is really great.  You are given access to countless matches and segments that you have probably forgotten about.  Some of the matches are of really high quality and the ones that aren't have particpants that really know how to work a crowd and draw you into the match.  I would highly recommend this DVD and I hope there will be a volume 2.",1309305600,8,13857,4.486139011651265
6034976,1,B00FWVXRNE,I still don't see how it's the best of Monday Nitro without Chris Beniot The man was apart of the 4 horsemen let alone the great matches he had with Dean Malenko(had to give it a 1 to publish it doesnt deserve a 1 don't buy),1309132800,,224,3.891304347826087
6034977,3,B00FWVXRNE,"The minute i saw that this was coming out i pre-ordered this set here on amazon and anxiously awaited its arrival in my mailbox on the release date. When i got it i was VERY excited and couldn't wait to begin watching it. But unfortunately, There's FAR too much of the NWO on this set and not enough of guys like Goldberg, Dean Malenko, and Eddie Guerrero. Out of all three discs, The first disc is the most enjoyable since you do get more of a variety of matches and footage out of it then you get out of the other 2 discs. Unfortunately, Other than the CLASSIC match between Sting and Diamond Dallas Page for the WCW world title, a lot of disc 3 is very mediocre [which is expected since it covers 1999-2001 which were the dying days of WCW]. Credit has to go to Diamond Dallas Page for being a unbiased host and telling things the way they were on this set instead of revising things to please WWE like many have done on previous WWE dvd releases. But the main thing that drags this release down more than anything is that almost HALF of the matches on this set are already available on other sets meaning that you will get SEVERAL repeats out of this set!!! I started watching Nitro in 1997 [along with Raw which this show competed against for 6 years] so this set did at least bring back some good memories. Here's what i thought of the matches:

Disc 1
Brian Pillman [RIP] VS. Jushin Liger
The first match of the set was also the first-ever match in the history of Nitro. Although this doesn't measure up with their classic match from Superbrawl II, This was a nice fast-paced match. ***1/2

For the WCW World Heavyweight Championship
Champion Hulk Hogan VS. Big Bubba Rogers [RIP]
I'ma say this now: I never really thought much of Hogan as a wrestler but by the time he got to WCW he was WAY over the hill. This was the main event of the first episode of Nitro and this is at least a somewhat tolerable match. Of interest mainly for the return of Lex Luger from WWF after this match ended. **1/2

Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage [RIP] VS. Ric Flair and Arn Anderson
This is one of the better WCW Hogan matches i've seen and this is no surprise since every man he's surrounded by in this match is an infinitely better wrestler than him!! Flair and Anderson really make this match worth watching as they attempt their usual heel tactics on Hogan and Savage and the good wrestling that was provided in this match makes this a good tag match. ****

For the WCW World Tag Team Championships
Champions Sting and Lex Luger VS. The Road Warriors
This was a pretty good tag title match and it was nice to see the pre-crow Sting and The Road Warriors. ***1/2

Parking Lot Brawl
Lord Steven Regal VS. Belfast Bruiser
NOW THIS IS ENTERTAINING!!! With the ring removed and a few cars put in its place, These 2 men put on a good match in this hardcore parking lot brawl!! These 2 guys put on a match that could've rivaled the original ECW in terms of hardcore [look out for the spot where the Bruiser attempts to kick Regal but misses and instead kicks a window of a car completely shattering it!!] and although i don't remember his opponent of this match, Regal was great here and it shows the diversity of Regal's wrestling abilities and it's a shame that Regal never did get a real chance to shine because he would've made a great champion in either WCW or WWE. The only reason i will not rate this match higher than what i'm gonna rate it is because this match definitely needed some blood. ****

Ric Flair VS. Eddie Guerrero [RIP]
What a great match!!! Matches like this were the reason that Nitro kicked Raw's butt in the ratings for a while!!!! There's plenty of great in-ring action on display here and the late great Eddie Guerrero shows even here that he was such an excellent wrestler that will be missed for many many years. Flair did a pretty well job in this match as well as there were plenty of suspenseful near-falls and good technical wrestling. Fans of either Guerrero or Flair need to see this one!!! ****1/2 [Best Match of disc 1]

Triangle match for the WCW World Tag Team Championships
Champions Sting and Lex Luger VS. The Steiner Brothers VS. Harlem Heat
I've never really been a big fan of 3 way tag team matches but this was a pretty decent match. ***1/2

Sting and Lex Luger VS. Kevin Nash and Scott Hall
This was an okay match but nothing special in my opinion. ***

Rey Mysterio VS. Dean Malenko
These two guys NEVER had a bad match and this match was pretty good just like all of the other matches these 2 had in WCW. It's too bad Malenko doesn't get too many matches on this set because he was one hell of a wrestler. ****

Disc 2 [I call this the NWO disc because they appear in almost every single match and segment on this disc!]

Diamond Dallas Page VS. Mark Starr
This was just a squash match that could've easily been left off of this set [but they could've instead just left in the aftermath of the match where the NWO attempted to recruit DDP]. **

For the WCW Cruiserweight Championship
Champion Syxx VS. Rey Mysterio
A pretty good fast-paced cruiserweight match marred only by the presence of the NWO. ***1/2

For the WCW World Heavyweight Championship
Champion Hollywood Hogan VS. Lex Luger
Not really a good match as i'm not really much of a fan of either of these guys. I guess it was okay for a tv match. **1/2

Diamond Dallas Page VS. Buff Bagwell
This was just an average match. It was nice to see Raven though [why wasn't any of his segments with the flock included in this set????????????]. **1/2

Sting VS. Randy Savage [RIP]
A pretty good match here. Interestingly, The Macho Man was in a no man's land as he was neither on WCW's or the NWO's side any longer so that meant he had nobody to trust anymore. This match was pretty good for what it was. ***1/2

For the WCW World Heavyweight Championship
Champion Hollywood Hogan VS. Goldberg
Somewhat of an overrated match, This match was watchable mainly due to the audience. Keep in mind that neither of these guys were great wrestlers [although both were entertaining] so you're not gonna see great technical moves or anything like that. I must say that this match was a missed opportunity for WCW as they could've made MILLIONS if this match was saved for Starrcade 98. Instead, in true Bischoff fashion, This match was allowed to main event an episode of Nitro in an attempt to defeat Raw again for the week [by this time the attitude era was under way in the WWF and they made a comeback in the ratings against WCW]. This match did earn Nitro higher ratings than Raw for the week it aired but it was an average match at best. **1/2

For the WCW World Tag Team Championships
Champions Kevin Nash and Sting VS. Scott Hall and The Giant
This was another average tag title match. ***

Rey Mysterio VS. Chris Jericho
I liked this match. Nitro was a good show partly because of the excellent action that the cruiserweights provided throughout. If you like either of these guys you'll like this match. ****

For the WCW Cruiserweight Championship
Champion Juventud Guerrera VS. Billy Kidman
I was happy to see another cruiserweight match and boy was this a great one!!! Lots of aerial action were put on display from these two and there was never a dull moment in this match. The story here was that Billy Kidman [along with the other members of the flock] abandoned Raven the night before this match and this was Kidman's first match outside of the flock and this is where he won his first cruiserweight title. This is a great example of just how essential the cruiserweights were to WCW. ****1/2 [best match on disc 2]

For the WCW U.S. Championship
Champion Bret Hart VS. Diamond Dallas Page
This was a decent match especially when you take into consideration how lackluster Bret's WCW stint really was. ***

Ric Flair VS. Eric Bischoff
I know this was a hot feud in 98 but this match could've really been left off as this match is just a terrible squash match. *

Disc 3

For the WCW World Heavyweight Championship
Champion Kevin Nash VS. Hollywood Hogan
This is the infamous Fingerpoke Of Doom. In terms of wrestling this was absolutely nothing but in terms of sheer comedy, this is still the funniest moment in all of wrestling history!!!!! Sure stuff like this played a large role in the downfall of WCW but i'm willing to bet that you laughed at least once when you saw this!!!! ***** [FOR COMEDIC PURPOSES ONLY]

For the WCW World Heavyweight Championship
Champion Diamond Dallas Page VS. Sting
EXCELLENT MATCH!! Although this match happened when WCW was beginning to fall, You can't deny that this was one hell of a match!!! Sting and DDP put on excellent performances throughout and they both make this match a bonafide classic!! This was one of the best matches in Nitro history and i'm very greatful that this was included in this set and in my opinion, this was the best match of the entire set [even if it is on the worst disc]. This was a pay-per-view caliber title match and i would have to say that both of these men really tore the house down in this match as the crowd was really into it!!! Sure there were even better matches than this on Nitro throughout the years but for what was included on this set, It doesn't get any better than this right here!!!! This was DDP's best match of all time and this match stands as a testament to how great of a wrestler Sting really was back then. This match alone is worth the price of this set!!! ***** [best match on disc 3 and the best match of the entire set]

Eddie Guerrero [RIP] VS. Juventud Guerrera
This was Guerrero's first match back since an unfortunate accident he suffered earlier in 1999 and he puts on a good performance against Juventud here. ***1/2

Hulk Hogan, Goldberg, and Sting VS. Kevin Nash, Sid Vicious, and Rick Steiner
An okay 6 man tag which sees the return of the red and yellow Hulk Hogan. The match is nothing special but it's worth a watch. ***

Diamond Dallas Page VS. Billy Kidman
This was an impromptu match which started because of the fact that DDP [who was by now a heel] overheard Kidman's opinion on his then-wife Kimberly which infuriated DDP and lead to DDP attacking Kidman. This was an alright match. ***

For the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship
Bret Hart VS. Goldberg
On the night after Starrcade 99 Bret and Goldberg wrestled to determine who was the real WCW champion after Bret forfeited the title 24 hours earlier. This was not that good of a match and this match is notable for the reunion of the NWO. **1/2

For the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship
Sid Vicious VS. Kevin Nash
As the WCW commissioner, Kevin Nash banned Sid Vicious from using the powerbomb which was designed to make this even more of a challenge for Sid. This was nothing but another big man's match and this could be skipped. **

Steel Cage Match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship
Champion Jeff Jarrett VS. Diamond Dallas Page
This painfully average cage match took place in the height of the Russo era and this is not a good match despite the talent involved. **

Ladder Match
Jung Dragons VS. 3 Count
Although this took place during a horrible time in WCW's history this match was pretty good as all six of these guys gave it their all despite the little time that was put aside for this match. This doesn't compare to the ladder matches WWF was having with Edge and Christian and The Hardy's but it's a fun little match. ***

For the WCW World Heavyweight Championship
Champion Booker T VS. Lance Storm
Booker was a great wrestler in WCW and more of his matches deserved to be on this set but oh well i guess this is all Vince wanted to show of Booker's matches in this set. Lance Storm actually had a pretty worthy stint in WCW as he once held the U.S., Hardcore, and Cruiserweight titles simultaneously and when this match took place Lance was considered a worthy challenger to Booker's WCW championship. This was a pretty good match that unfortunately was marred somewhat by the totally unnecessary ringside antics of Mike Awesome [during his dreadful fat chick thriller gimmick] . If you can put up with the stupid stuff Mike Awesome and some fat girl do at the announcer's desk, you'll find yourself enjoying this match but this match is also a good example of how stupid WCW had gotten. ***1/2

Triple cage war games match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship
This match included then WCW champion Kevin Nash, Jeff Jarrett, Sting, Goldberg, Booker T, and several others in a match where the object was to climb the three cages and capture the WCW championship which was in the third cage and then go all the way back down and walk outside the cage with the belt. There was FAR too many things going on in this match making this a pain to watch. **

Sting VS. Ric Flair
This was the main event of the final episode of Nitro and in that aspect this is a historical match but is it a good match? Ultimately, no. It's not a terrible match but these two guys have had much better matches against each other over the years and this simply doesn't even begin to measure up to the classics these 2 had in the late 80's-early 90's. **1/2

There you have it. This set definitely could've used some more cruiserweight matches and could've shown more guys like Raven, La Parka, and Konnan. Unfortunately Chris Benoit doesn't get any matches on this set due to the infamous murder-suicide he committed back in 2007 [although he's seen on the Four Horsemen reunion segment]. This doesn't even BEGIN to show the best of Nitro as its loaded with a few too many needless segments and not enough great matches but this is worth the purchase for the classic match between Sting and DDP.  Since this dvd was obviously a successful release i can only hope that WWE decides to do a volume 2 of this set [and maybe even a best of Thunder set].",1309046400,6,13828,4.477760127084988
6034978,4,B00FWVXRNE,"I could think of more matches but hope WWE do best of NWO or best of PPVs from WCW like hog wild, spring stampede, bash at the the beach I think it will be a volume 2",1308873600,,166,3.5135135135135136
6034979,3,B00FWVXRNE,"This is a really good set and I don't think any WCW fan will be disappointed, but I would have like to have seen a few more matches. That is not to say there is a shortage, but sometimes they focus to much on the NWO invasion and not enough on the matches at the begining. Listen I know the NWO is what put them over the top, but throw an entire match in while you build up to that. With all that being said it is still a great disk and if you are a WCW fan  you will really want to get this and enjoy. Lord knows this maybe all we get from Vince and the WWE.",1308787200,2,559,3.697478991596639
6034980,4,B00FWVXRNE,"I will happily admit to being a Monday Nitro fanatic.

Every Monday night during the time known as the Monday Night Wars, I was not one of the millions who couldn't decide which program to watch.  For myself, it was really simple - I was watching Nitro.  From the Cruiserweights and the NWO to the reunion of the greatest stable in wrestling history, the Four Horsemen, I was hooked.

And so as soon as I heard that WWE was releasing the Best of Monday Nitro, I knew for sure that it was something I'd buy and watch end to end the day it came out.  I also knew that I'd likely regret that decision thanks to some of the other revisionist history that we've seen on other DVD releases *cough*Monday Night Wars*cough*.

But what we got here was actually pretty good. Instead of being a corporation-friendly host, DDP does a good job of introducing the clips they chose, describing what was actually happening in the company when it was happening, and setting up the moments as they come.  According to reports, he made significant changes to the script he was given, and I think that you can tell that this isn't the same kind of BS that the WWE put together for other WCW collections, and for that I'm glad.

The clips, overall, are pretty good until you get to disc three, which starts with the infamous ""Fingerpoke of Doom"" and chronicles the subsequent destruction of WCW.  I had never before seen this part of the show, since I was one of many who tuned out Nitro after Schiavonne told us that Cactus Jack was about to win a world title on RAW, and never looked back, and it's interesting to see how all of this led to the demise of the once-great company.  I don't think I'll ever look back on this as being the ""Very Best"" of anything, and I doubt I'll ever be watching this again, but for the history lesson, it is important to have included.

Overall, I loved looking back on all these great matches, and seeing all of the stuff that really made me a life-long fan back in the day.  There is no Chris Benoit to speak of, for understandable reasons (although you can see him in the background of a few clips), just about every other major talent is included in some way, even Dean Malenko, an old favorite of mine who I was sure wouldn't be seen or heard from.  From that angle, they did a great job.

Unfortunately, since Hulk Hogan, Bischoff, Flair, Jarrett and Sting are all currently working for TNA, we don't get to see them on interviews, and that is really quite a shame.  Those were THE five major players in all of this, and it would have been phenomenal to hear what they all had to say about what was going on in the company, and to hear some of their reflections on what was no doubt the best time in the history of wrestling (or sports entertainment, if you want to go there).  Hopefully, in a few years when TNA is put out of business thanks to insane booking and terrible business decisions, WWE will give all of these guys a legends contract and we can see some more old WCW stuff let out to light.

And seriously, WWE, what's taking so long on releasing a Starrcade collection or a Wargames collection.  All of us old WCW fans are dying to see some of that stuff brought back!",1308528000,,3199,4.365935919055649
6034981,5,B00FWVXRNE,"I was always a WWE fan throughout the Monday Night War, but I still watched the replays late at night of Monday Night Nitro to see if I missed anything. It was generally understood that WCW had all the star power and the Monday night shows were always a trainwreck and you never knew what would happen. The wrestling wasn't always so great, but the politics and behind the scenes gossip made the shows news worthy every week. I was glued to the internet every week to see what was happening and who disliked who on the WCW side.

This DVD brings back everyone of those memories. By the time disc one was over, I was thinking, ""Yeah, I know why I always watched WWE now"". Don't get me wrong, WCW had good stuff too. If I was Diamond Dallas Page, I usually stopped to watch. He hosts the DVD and I think he was an excellent choice. I also watched the Ric Flair spots and if Major Gunns was on the screen, I usually stopped. Funny thing, I didn't see any of Major Gunns or the other girls. Toward the end of WCW, the wrestlers each had two or three girls that they hung out with, usually strippers or something they had got on the show. A lot of the segments would be them sitting around in the back and plotting what they would do next with a room full of women. I bet they miss that gravy train.

Anyway, by the third disc, the train leaves the tracks and it is the mess I really remember it being. Kevin Nash ended the streak of Goldberg, one of the hottest wrestlers in the industry at the time, and soon after, there was nothing special about WCW at all after that. Once the mmomentum was gone, there was no catching Austin and his crew. Stone Cold was too hot at the time. Goldberg was right with Austin for the longest time, but WCW or Kevin Nash, decided to end it because he was getting too big and they ruined for themselves and everyone else.

If you were around for this time in wrestling history, your going to love hearing the horrendous commentary from Schiovone and whoever else. The superstars who did the least they could get by with and we still fell for it for a while, until we caught on, or they just got too lazy for us to buy it any longer. Then the end, when ""the powers that be' came in with their internet style booking and tried to let everyone be an insider. Oh, it gets really bad at the end...so bad. But your going to love seeing all this again. Its a fun trip down memory lane.",1308441600,,2407,4.205627705627705
6034982,4,B00FWVXRNE,"There was always competition between WWE & WCW (and going back even further when it was the NWA) but this was the show that really turned that competition into an all out war...a Monday Night War...that went for 6 years until it finally ended around a decade ago.  The New World Order, luchadors & crusierweights, Four Horsemen, tag teams, metamorphosis of Sting...it's here to revisit in the Best Of Nitro.  Now a couple of notes here in that Diamond Dallas Page host the DVD & anyone that's been following the news in regards to this DVD knows that he completely changed the script WWE had for this set to his opinions are honest & direct.  In regards to Chris Benoit, the only footage that is edited in regards to him is during Ric Flair's return to Nitro when Arn Anderson is paying respect to each individual Horsemen member before introducing Flair but past that, he's clearly visible & acknowledged.  The only other footage that is edited (that I caught) is Goldberg being tazered during the ""Fingerpoke Of Doom.""  Along with the various matches are many Nitro moments including Scott Hall's Nitro Debut, Kevin Nash's debut two weeks later, Hollywood Hogan's first interview since forming the New World Order, the infamous incident of The Outsiders attacking WCW talent backstage at Disney MGM, another in-ring attack by the nWo, Lex Luger gets attacked outside by ""Sting"", Sting's speech to WCW where he declares himself a free agent, Roddy Piper revealing Eric Bischoff as part of the nWo, Eric Bischoff gets suspended, Sting's first drop from the rafters on Nitro, the parody of the Horsemen by the nWo, Chris Jericho names his 1,004 holds, Ric Flair returns to WCW & reforms the Horsemen, Bret Hall calls out Goldberg, Eric Bischoff & Vince Russo relaunch WCW, and Vince McMahon declaring his bought WCW.

Matches Include:
Brian Pillman vs. Jushin Liger - This was the debut match on WCW Monday Nitro and boy did they know how to kick this show off in style. This was very past paced with the high-flyin' action that you expected that wasn't always pretty (like a botched head scissors off the top rope) but also had a good mix of wrestling with moves like the surfboard/reverse headlock combination by Liger & a DDT off the top rope by Pillman. Great action as you would expect from both men.
Sept. 95
[Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon]

Hulk Hogan vs. Big Bubba Rogers - This was the first main event of Nitro that went back & forth between both men with the bigger issue being the confrontation with ex-WWE superstar Lex Luger afterwords.
Sept. 95

Randy Savage & Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair & Arn Anderson - Hogan & Savage were running wild early being very dominate including having duel figure fours on both men at one point before the Horsemen were able to regain control & at one point threw Savage over the top rope with such force that he landed underneath the guardrail before cutting the ring off & working over Savage building to the hot tag to Hogan.  This was a fun tag match that would have normally been a main event on a WCW PPV but showcased Bischoff's strategy to put Nitro on the map in that he gave away these types of matches almost every week.
Jan. 96

WCW Tag Team Champions Match Sting & Lex Luger vs. Road Warriors - The Road Warriors (Legion Of Doom) reunited as a tag team & returned to WCW around a month earlier & right away challenged for the WCW Tag Team Titles setting up this match.  Sting & Luger had their issues with each other as Luger couldn't completely be trusted because of his ways of taking shortcuts to get the victory which was clearly seen between the two partners early on.  Luger targeted Animal's back, that was previously injured & took him out of action for an extended period of time, with various stomps & slams throughout the match before the action went back & forth between both teams with Luger once again getting assistance & taking a shortcut, unwanted by Sting, to get the advantage in what turned out to be a good tag team match.
As a side note, this match is more memorable for the power outage that happened during the match which made Eric Bischoff (at the time) go as far as accusing WWE of the power outage in an attempt to sabotage the show just showing how paranoid both companies got turning this period of the Monday Night War.
Feb. 96

Parking Lot Brawl: Belfast Bruiser vs. Steven Regal - For those who didn't already know, Belfast Bruiser is the wrestler we currently know as Finlay while Regal is the same wrestler we know today as William Regal.  This was one of the most physical feuds in WCW at this time as both men didn't know the meaning of the word ""stiff"" & just beat the hell out of each other each time they competed against each other leading to this match.  These two used anything & everything they could get their hands on in the parking lot including various weapons like a brick, bumper, tire, seat belt, and guardrail while taking hard bumps such as Finlay putting his foot through a car window & later being on the receiving end of a piledriver on the roof of a car.  A very violent brawl with of course Bobby Heenan having to get the last word in the match that was just typical ""Brain.""
Apr. 96

Eddie Guerrero vs. Ric Flair - The previous night at Slamboree, Eddie teamed with Arn Anderson against Flair & Randy Savage in a ""Lethal Lottery"" match only for Anderson to turn on Guerrero to help Flair get the victory so Eddie was out for revenge here.  They started off wrestling but got very aggressive over time with their exchanging of chops & Eddie bringing a fight to Flair to the point where he attempted to bring a chair into the ring.  Eddie played Flair's own mind games against him by taunting him by going as far as to do his strut on the floor & even applying the figure four on Flair.  Both men traded momentum & was very competitive before Guerrero ended up hurting his leg with a high risk move that led Flair to take advantage as only Flair knows how.  Bobby Heenan described this match perfectly at the end, ""Guerrero gave him a fight.""
May 96

WCW Tag Team Champions Sting & Lex Luger vs. Steiner Brothers vs. Harlem Heat - This was a glorified handicap match as both teams had their issues with Harlem Heat causing them to not be able to tag out of the match but definitely delivered a good performance against both teams but this was more about what happened in the end that caused the most unusual finish to a match that anyone had ever seen at that time.
June 96

Sting & Lex Luger vs. Outsiders - After what happened at the Road Wild PPV days earlier, Sting & Luger wanted a rematch here with them playing their own mind games at the start against Hall & Nash.  Nick Patrick was the referee & just let this them go making this an ""unofficial"" No Disqualification match as they brawling in the ring & on the floor but it was what happened towards the end of the match that had people begin to question of loyal of not just the wrestlers but also the officials when it came to the New World Order.
Aug. 96

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Dean Malenko - The night after Starrcade where both men suffered loses in the crusierweight division, both men were looking to rebound here.  Malenko worked on grounding Rey & working over his back while Mysterio relied on his speed as both men knew each other so well that they were able to keep countering each others holds throughout the match.  This didn't match or top their more famous encounters but still quality.
Dec. 96

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Mark Starr - Eric Bischoff & Ted Dibiase were doing the commentary here in what was nothing more than a squash match but it was the appearance of Hall & Nash after the match that was the real story here.
Jan. 97

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Syxx vs. Rey Mysterio Jr. - Nash was in Syxx's corner (referring to him as 6-Pac for the first time on television) as these two had a very fast paced match with Rey delivering a heavy amount of frankensteiners throughout the contest causing Syxx to use the numbers game against Rey.  Earlier in the show, former Horsemen manager James J. Dillion was appointed to the position of WCW Commissioner & made his presence known.
Apr. 97

WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Lex Luger - This match happened on the 100th episode of ""WCW Monday Nitro"" and after chasing Hogan for months, Luger got his title shot here. This was a different Hollywood Hogan than usual as he didn't try to stall & avoid Luger but went straight at him & took the fight to Luger. This match was as good as you expected it to be for television with Luger overcoming Hogan & the nWo to finally bring back the WCW Championship to WCW.
Aug. 97
[Greatest Stars Of The 90's]

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Buff Bagwell - This was a nice match but nothing very special past a tease of a confrontation between page & his old acquaintance in Raven.
Sept. 97

Sting vs. Randy Savage - ""Madness"" was the definition of Randy Savage at this point of his career because he had no allies in WCW but also alienated himself from all the members of the nWo so he was a man to himself.  These two brawled on the floor right away & kept that mentality as this was just an aggressive fight with both men trading fist & even had the ringside steps get involved here before the issues between WCW & nWo along with the nWo members themselves resulted in all out chaos.
Feb. 98

WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Goldberg - This was more about putting Goldberg over as WCW's ""superhero"" & top star more than anything else as Hogan threw everything he could at Goldberg by either wrestling him & resorting to cheating only for Goldberg to not be effected by it & keep coming back dominating his way to the WCW Championship. With cameos from Dallas Page, Karl Malone, and Curt Hennig...this wasn't much as far as a ""match"" goes but this was all about making Goldberg the top superstar in WCW.
July 98
[Monday Night War; History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]

WCW Tag Team Champions Kevin Nash & Sting vs. Scott Hall & The Giant - Only two months earlier at Slamboree, Sting was a member of WCW teaming with Giant who had just recently joined nWo Hollywood against Hall & Nash who were nWo Wolfpack members...fast forward only two months later & we have the same four guys in a tag team match but under completely different circumstances.  This match was booked right away after a fight both nWo factions had backstage the point where Sting wasn't even in his ring gear but jeans & a shirt.  This was a fun tag team match that was non-stop action with a hot crowd & both teams trading momentum.
July 98

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Chris Jericho - This started off with a bang as Mysterio was jumped by Jericho getting into the ring.  Both took to the air with high risk moves such as a top rope dropkick on Mysterio that knocked him to the floor with the back of his head hitting the railing while Jericho later missed his springboard dropkick that sent him outside to the floor before later being frankensteinered off the apron into the ring.  Jericho also tried at one point a very unique submission that Mike Tenay could only try to describe as an ""octopus"" & also delivering one hell of a release german suplex that flipped Rey inside out.  This was definitely a great crusierweight match between the two that also continues the setup of Jericho's match going into the next PPV in regards to who counted the final pinfall.
Aug. 98

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Juventud Guerrera vs. Billy Kidman - This was Kidman's first match since leaving Raven's flock complete with him having his clean cut look back after being dirty & scratching himself for a year.  Anyone who remembers the series of matches Kidman & Juvi had throughout the entire year knows that each one was very fast paced & high impact with this being absolutely no exception including various moves & moments such as Kidman delivering a variation of a back suplex that seemed to knock Juvi out for a few moments along with later catching Juvi in midair with a powerbomb while Juvi brought it himself with moves like a release german suplex along with his high flying offense but the ending was a performance that had one talent give the other one a standing ovation.
Sept. 98

WCW United States Champion Bret Hart vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This was the night after Halloween Havoc with DDP coming into this match being very exhausted from his intense match with Goldberg that he showed signs of it from the previous night to the point where at one time Page couldn't apply an armbar correctly so he just went for a pin instead.  They traded momentum here as Bret was more focused on brawling & taking shortcuts than out-wrestling DDP such as doing moves like a low blow.  This was a good match with a very brutal aftermath.
Oct. 98

Ric Flair vs. Eric Bischoff - After the screwjob Bischoff did to Flair the previous night at Starrcade, Flair got a rematch with all of his money on the line against Bischoff's job as the WCW President.  This was nothing more than Ric Flair delivering the beating that everyone in WCW (and maybe even other companies) wanted to see Bischoff get for the longest time as Flair was just running on pure emotion to the point where he threw Charles Robinson out of the way just to beat on Bischoff.  The Horsemen were there to make sure we didn't get a repeat of what happened at Starrcade while one superstar who wasn't seen for months also made his return that resulted in so many of the WCW talents (including Tony Schavone himself) having a well deserved celebration.
Dec. 98

WCW Champion Kevin Nash vs. Hollywood Hogan - This was the INFAMOUS ""fingerpoke of doom"" where quite frankly the less said the better but it should be noted that the use of the tazer was edited out of this footage.
Jan. 99

WCW Champion Diamond Dallas Page vs. Sting - Both men began by trading punches with DDP showing heel tenancies such as pulling hair, delivering a low blow & constantly going to floor whenever Sting began to build momentum.  The referee let these men get away with what would usually result in a disqualification resulting in both men brawling on the outside & bouncing each other off the guardrail before Page went after Sting's knee & used the post in the process.  This was a very intense & high impact match here with the crowd being very hot from start to finish with one moment to look out for being Sting giving DDP one of the nastiest looking piledrivers I've seen that made me cringe a little when I saw it.  DDP said after this match that this was one of the best in his career & I can't say I disagree.
Apr. 99

Eddie Guerrero vs. Juventud Guerrera - This was Eddie's return to the ring after his motorcycle accident earlier in the year with the story of Juventud trying to show respect to Eddie early on only for Eddie to make it clear that he was out for revenge for Juvi & the other luchadors abandoning the Latino World Order (DON'T ASK!) once Eddie was out injured.  Not much of note here except it was very fast paced with Juvi giving Eddie some hard chops that left Eddie's chest red but Guerrero looked like he hadn't lost a step & possibly in the best physical shape of his career.
June 99

Hulk Hogan, Goldberg, Sting vs. Kevin Nash, Sid Vicious, Rick Steiner - Before the match got started, we had a memorable moment in the return of HULK Hogan.  This was more of a preview of the upcoming matches between members of each team coming up at the Road Wild PPV along with getting the tease of the upcoming ""Battle Of The Millennium Man"" between Goldberg & Sid.  A fun six man tag match overall with Hogan showing that his old self might be back but he has no problems resorting back to his ""Hollywood"" ways when necessary.
Aug. 99

Billy Kidman vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This was pretty short & sweet with DDP being in a jealous rage over comments Kidman about Kimberly before we saw his anger get the best of him.
Aug. 99

WCW Championship Match: Bret Hart vs. Goldberg - This match was during the initial ""Vince Russo"" era of WCW & happened the night after Starrcade where we got that ""screwjob"" ending in the match between these two resulting in Bret Hart forfeiting the championship & having a rematch here to determine the true champion.  Goldberg showcased early that he had the clear power advantage before both men decided on the same strategy on working on each others legs with Goldberg executing an anklelock while Bret did a figure four.  The big picture though was how everything went down during the match that led to not only a champion to be determined but also ""The Band Is Back Together!""
Dec. 99

WCW Championship Match: Sid Vicious vs. Kevin Nash - Although it wasn't brought up or discussed during the match, this was for WCW Championship that became vacant after Chris Benoit won the WCW Title despite making it clear that he was quitting the company & it should also be noted that Nash was the WCW Commissioner at this time so he banned Sid from using the powerbomb.  As anyone who remembered their series back in the WWE around 5 years earlier got around the same match here in that it was just an average big man match with the match being taken into the front row at one point with later Sid proving the phrase ""he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer"" wrong as he was able to outsmart everyone towards the end.
Jan. 00

Steel Cage Match: WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Diamond Dallas Page - The cage used for this match was the regular sized cage but also had a top on it (like WCW did with the War Games matches) while Vince Russo was in Jarrett's corner.  Knowing how personal this feud was between these two (including Page's wife serving him with divorce papers earlier in the show), they started this fight on the outside & went through the crowd with even a trash can being used before making it's way to the cage.  Anyone who remembers the ""Russo"" era of WCW knows what to expect here as far as run-ins & chaos but it didn't effect what was a good match.
Apr. 00

Ladder Match: Jung Dragons vs. 3 Count - Former MMA fighter Tank Abott came out to the ring to introduce WCW's resident boy band 3 Count & dance to their music (yes, you read that right) before the Yung Dragons came out to start this match off.  This match was short but still had it's moments like a superplex off the ladder that was on the top rope, an airplane spin with the ladder that knocked out everyone in sight, and Evan's dangerous fall to the floor.  This was the beginning of what many would consider one of the last great feuds of WCW between these six crusierweights as we saw that they would top this match at the upcoming New Blood Rising PPV & months later at Starrcade but this was good for what it was.
July 00

WCW Champion Booker T. vs. Lance Storm - Lance Storm was only in WCW for a short time here but made one hell of an impact as he became a triple crown champion by capturing all of the singles titles (U.S., Hardcore, Crusierweight) so now he was going for the ""Grand Slam"" by challenging for the biggest one of them all in the WCW Championship. The match was real short but was a good contest here for what it was if you can get past the distractions like Mike Awesome on commentary doing his ""Fat Chick Thriller"" gimmick (Don't Ask!).
Aug. 00
[Rise & Fall Of WCW]

Triple Cage War Games Match: WCW Champion Kevin Nash, Jeff Jarrett, Scott Steiner, Vince Russo vs. Sting, Booker T, Goldberg, Kronik - This wasn't the traditional two ringed War Games match as this match took place in one ring but three different structures as they used the triple layered cage that was seen in the ""Ready To Rumble"" movie & months earlier at Slamboree.  The World Title was to be hung at the top of the third cage with the object of the match being for someone to climb the three cages & get the belt only to come back down with it & the person who actually walks out of the cage with the title is the champion.  This match had multiple stories being told such as Kevin Nash having issues with Russo (and his own team members) for not only booking this match but stating himself that he wanted to be the World Champion along with Nash's strategy throughout the match only pushing his mentality of being ""the smartest man in wrestling"", the issues so many had with Vince Russo including one guy who wasn't even legally in the match, the return of a WCW superstar who hadn't been seen in months, and another appearance of a WCW superstar who had his own grudge with Goldberg.  This was a match that was pretty much all over the place but was still very entertaining.
Sept. 00

Sting vs. Ric Flair - They wrestled on the first Nitro & this was the final match on the last Nitro.  Both men tried going out & having fun which you could clearly see they both exchanged smiles at one point but anyone who watched the Ric Flair documentary knows that he stated that he was out of shape (hence wearing a T-shirt) & neither guy had wrestled in months so they weren't at their best here as we saw at one point that Flair was unable to do his top rope flip.  This wasn't their best encounter but definitely far from the worst but is very important in the history of Nitro for this being the final match in the original WCW.
Mar. 01

(F.Y.E. Edition) Crusierweight Champion Rey Mysterio vs. J.L. - Both men were evenly matched early on with Mysterio using his lucha libre aerial offense from different positions from a springboard & to the top rope while Lynn was working a more grounded game working over the back area with submissions along with taking some shortcuts while one man who had a vested interest looked on in what was a competitive match but more significant for what was going on backstage involving the nWo that the camera kept cutting away to.
Aug. 96

There are no DVD extras on the regular version but the other extras on the F.Y.E. edition feature DDP showcasing his career highlights on the show & talking about the time Sting took him up in the rafters.

DDP said it best at the end of this when he made it clear that you couldn't possibly shove 6 years of history into 3 disc & WWE would never be able to come out with a set that makes everyone happy but I still question some of the choices made here as far as memories & matches such as DDP's matches against both Bagwell & Kidman weren't relevant to anything in WCW history so I'm thinking they only put those on here because DDP was hosting the set while I would have also preferred the full Arn Anderson retirement speech instead of the nWo's spoof the next week & maybe even Goldberg's U.S. title win.  Either way they got a bunch of the memories I have from Nitro in moments & matches while having a small amount of repeats that I didn't mind so this is a DVD set to add to the collection.",1308441600,2,22762,4.451682692307692
6034983,4,B00FWVXRNE,"This was long overdue. Having been a wrestling fan for a good 20 years or so (i'm 26) and seeing the monday night wars aswell as the golden age of both WCW and WWE, this is definitely something you need to own or at the very least watch. It's over 9hrs (over 3hrs per disc) of actual wrestling footage from wrestler introductions all the way to the end of the match non stop. Yes that means 9+ hrs of non stop wrestling and not 90% story and 10% actual wrestling. It is so much wrestling footage that i was actually sad to see that DDP did not say very much and it was one match after another, before he would appear to talk after the 3rd or 4th match.

This collection will really bring back memories for anyone watching during that time. So much that if you were to sit down and watch most (if not all) of the 9hr footage non stop, you would actually feel like if it was happening in real time and you will quickly want to start watching the PPVs to see what you weren't showned. Since for example you would be shown Hall and Nash disrupting Nitro week after week and then immediately you are shown Hogan together with Hall and Nash on the July 8, 1996 edition of Nitro (since they joined up the night before at the Bash at the Beach PPV) with no explanation by DDP or anyone. So now that i have that out of way let me go into a bit of details into each disc and which disc and segments worth watching aswell as the cons of each disc.

Disc 1: The Starting Age (1995-1996)

This disc is great for fans who were not around during the early days of WCW (like myself). It sort of tells the story of what was to become the Monday Night Wars in the years to come. The first couple of matches shown are from the very first episode of Nitro which originated from Mall of America in Minneapolis, MN in Sept 1995 featuring a cruiser-weight match followed by Hulk Hogan vs Big Boss Man for the WCW Heavyweight Championship. Most of the disc feature cruiser-weight matches consisting of Billy Kidman, Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio Jr, and some other cruiser-weights. The second half of the disc tells the story of the Outsiders (Hall and Nash) ""invading"" WCW and what was to become the foundation of the nWo for years to come. Most of the nWo footage features original Sting and Lex Luger in one way or another.

Pros:

+ Introduces us to WCW and Monday Nitro from the early days.
+ Introduces the foundation of the nWo for years to come.
+ Nice cruiser-weight matches between Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio Jr and other cruiser-weights.
+ Everything was nice and simple, no flashy gimmicks or overdoing things to win new fans over.

Cons:

- The very first match shown did not need to be in here unless its trying to show the very first match on Monday Nitro and even if that was the case, a better match should have been booked as the first match on the first episode of Nitro.

- Matches such as the parking lot brawl outside of the MGM Studios in Orlando should never have been shown to us. Those were low card superstars and not even mid carders so why are they suppose to be the ""Best of WCW""? Honestly Vince Russo walking around and doing nothing is a better contender for ""WCW's Best"" than a match like that. They were low carders for a reason and you never saw them highlighting a main event did you? I think not.

Disc 2: The Golden Age (1997-1998)

Ah yes the best of the best or the golden age as i like to call it. If you were not watching this 2 year period boy where you missing out. Here is where nWo is at it's peak. Matches are mostly nWo related, aswell as mostly cruiser-weight matches mostly about Chris Jericho and Rey Mysterio Jr and some Eddie Guerrero. Matches featuring the black and white Sting, DDP, Goldberg, Lex Luger, Macho Man. All of these superstars at their peak.

Pros:

+ WCW, nWo, and all the top superstars at their peak.

+ Hogan vs Goldberg in Atlanta, GA with Goldberg winning the Heavyweight Title is just simply the best match on this collection and will always be a classic in every fan forever.

+ Great rivalries between Hogan against black and white Sting, Lex Luger, DDP, and Goldberg.

+ The Four Horsemen are featured aswell as Ric Flair matches.

- Cons:

- Too much nWo and not enough other matches such as the classic best of seven series between Booker T and Chris Benoit or other high flying cruiser-weight matches, plus more top tag team matches that featured great tag teams.

- Goldberg's music was replaced by his WWE Theme (the newer plain boring one). Why Vince McMahon did these editing is beyond me but that really killed Goldberg's moments in his matches and entrances. It just wasn't the same knowing that it was obviously edited in and the original and good theme music was taken off and buried like if it never was there. I mean seriously WTF!!!! and WHY!!!?

Disc 3: The Downfall Age (1999-2001)

I think the very first match shown sums up this disc very well and well what better way to start the disc than with the infamous ""Finger Poke of Doom"". Here in Disc 3 WCW is headed downhill for disaster. Let's face it that Train Left along time ago and there was just no way it was going to pull into that station ever again. While the Red and White nWo factions were okay and a nice refreshing view out of the constant nWo Barrage and threatening to eat itself whole, you can really feel like the air really was starting to be taken out of the balloon (To quote DDP himself). Most of the first half shows the period of the first Nitro stage redesign period with the second half showing the second and final stage redesign period. I honestly skipped 99% of this disc because i already knew just how bad it was going to be. Some of the notable matches include Goldberg vs Bret Hart, and the 3 Cages of Hell. The final third of the disc shows when Vince McMahon buys WCW and the final WCW Monday Nitro aswell as the final match on Nitro that featured Sting vs Ric Flair.

Pros:

+ None

Cons:

- Everything but it's not WWE's fault nor the Editing Department. It was WCW's fault.",1308096000,,6031,4.354723707664884
6034984,4,B00FWVXRNE,"Would I go as far as to call it fate? Probably not. It's wrestling, not meeting the woman of my dreams or finding the job of a lifetime. But when I landed on WCW Nitro one Monday evening and got stuck watching wrestling for the first time in probably eight years it was certainly good fortune. I was drawn in, but not completely. And then it happened: Hall made his first appearance as an ""Outsider"". I was instantly hooked and was once again a wrestling fan.

Many have tried to imitate that period of time when WCW kicked McMahon's butt in the ratings. Many have tried to recapture that magic, including those who lived it. But no one seems to be able to capture perfectly what made that such a historic period in wrestling.

Watching this DVD set does take me back and reminds me of what made it so great. The NWO was by far the greatest storyline in wrestling history. It was all in the delivery; sure we knew it was fake, but they made it feel so real. And I think that is what is missing today. Back then cameramen rushed back to see what was happening backstage. Now they are camped  back there, ready to shoot the 'scene'. It feels more scripted and takes away from what the WCW gave us then: that truly 'live' feel. More action was in the ring, whether wrestling or smack talk and people got pulled in more back then. Just look at the cups and other trash thrown in the ring and you know people truly hated the NWO!

This DVD is not without its faults, most notably the commentary. I love DDP and enjoy his commentary as a whole, but it could have been written and edited together better. Too many holes are left where the storyline jumped from Nitro to the next pay-per-view or episode of Thunder. For instance no explanation was ever given about Hulk Hogan joining the NWO.

Still, this is by far the best collection of that time put out on DVD so far. Sure, you can see a lot of this on YouTube, but it's usually bad quality and you have to search to try and get any order to it at all. So if you were ever a fan of WCW make sure to buy this. It is worth every penny!",1308096000,,2079,4.21356783919598
6034985,4,B00FWVXRNE,"So after watching 2 discs so far, I would have to say I have mixed feelings bout this DVD. First I would like to say this could of been ALOT better then what it was. It's so all over the place that you really can't follow anything that really happened and there is no explanations to what happened and why.

If you were a WCW fan and followed it back in the day, you know why and how all this came about. For someone like me, I remember what happened previously and what lead to some of these events, but if you are just a general wrestling fan and was wondering what the big hoopla was with WCW this will not do it for you. There is SO MUCH MISSING. I wouldnt loved DDP to give more commentary and built up the events ALOT more. Like why was Goldberg in cuffs, how the NWO got so big, why the NWO split, what lead to stings change, more of the DDP vs NWO battle, when did Bischoff become a NWO member, more Nick PAtrick being 1 sided before joining the NWO... So much coulda been added to this DVD. So much is just lacking to help the general audience get a grip on what really happened with WCW.

Is 3 DVD's enough?? I don't think so, this coulda of been so much better if it was like 5 discs. There is just SO MUCH.

I would love to see a best of WCW or a WCW collection. Just something that give people a better idea of what WCW was about. There was just so much that WCW had to offer that I'm sure the WWE doesn't want you to know cause WCW was a better product then WWF back then.

So all in all.

Pros:
Good for the WCW Fan
Alot of key events back on Nitro
Great to see Stars that no one has seen in forever
Some good matches

Cons:
No build up to the events
DDP was wasted as comentary
Lacks ALOT of events that were very important on Nitro
All over the place, no way to follow anything that really was going on

WCW Fan rating 4/5 Stars
General Audience 3/5 stars

I gave it 4/5 cause I was a die hard WCW fan back in the day, and it was great to relive some of these great moment, and hearing old entrances like Sting (darkside) and DDP and of course hearing some NWO.

Which would be nice to have a CD set ""Best of WCW entrances"" I would love to relives some of those entrance songs again.

But back to topic, if you were a die hard wcw fan you will enjoy reliving some of these great moments.

If you are just a general wrestling fan, I would recomment renting or borrowing this, unless you just have to have ever DVD released cause you collect. I think as a general fan you will get lost.",1308096000,,2501,3.9919839679358717

7/10..Have gone through two discs so far of the Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro and am somewhat satisfied with what I've watched so far. I think WWE could have made a more in-depth documentary style presentation, but they already presented that on The Rise and Fall of WCW and in my opinion the best DVD WWE made, The Monday Night Wars. Lots of good matches I've seen, some I've forgotten about. Definitely a DVD they just pieced together. Good addition to WCW fan library.",1307923200,,654,5.894736842105263
6034987,4,B00FWVXRNE,"Discs One and Two of this set reminded me exactly why WCW was the number one brand in professional wrestling in 1997-98; Disc Three reminded me why the company crashed and burned like a led balloon only 3 years later.  The Very Best of Monday Nitro could have been more aptly titled ""The Essential Monday Nitro"" or ""The Rise and Fall of Monday Nitro,"" in line with some previous WWE releases regarding their late 90's competition, as it is really more of a chronology than a ""best of"" set.  The set plays in chronological order, detailing most of the major mile-markers in the history of the program, and is pretty fairly balanced between matches and the non-wrestling segments that gave the 90's Monday shows their episodic feel.  Watching this set really brought back the old feelings of excitement about wrestling.  I actually felt more engaged by some of these 15 year-old segments than I do about the current WWE product (and of course the abysmal TNA show).

As far as the particulars go, I'll say this:

PROS -
* Pretty much all the biggest moments are here.
* Some of the really memorable moments are actually propped up by some of the less memorable ones, which helped to give the segments a little context that is lost on YouTube.
* The chronological ordering helps the set to feel like a highlight-reel version of the entire Nitro run.
* The set does a good job of resisting the urge to cater to the internet-only crowd and doesn't get buried in 23 different Psychosis vs. Cyclope matches.  Those matches were great live, but much like MMA fights, I feel like once they're done, they're done.  They really don't have much value 15 years later without any storyline or context.

CONS -
* There is no documentary.
* The diamond-plate sidebars clutter up the screen.  I ended up stretching the image to fill the screen so I wouldn't have to see them.
* Once things got messy after Starrcade 1997, the highlights were sort of few and far between.  Disc Three especially suffers from a lack of great moments.  Still, it does a good job of chronicling the facts of the WCW world in 99-01.
* The WWE continues the annoying practice of replacing certain theme songs with generic music beds.  The worst offense here is changing Hogan's theme from Voodoo Child to the main nWo theme for his match with Goldberg.  I know why they do it...but it still sucks.

Again, the thing that will be most apparent to the viewer will be the reaons why WCW ended up going out of business.  The fresh, fast paced, and exciting content of the first two discs gives way to a plodding, repetitive, jarbled mess on disc three.  When seen back-to-back and quickly as presented on these discs, the causes of WCW's demise become crystal clear.  All things considered though, I can say this was easily the most satisfying WCW release yet from WWE.",1307750400,21,2825,4.616
6034988,3,B00FWVXRNE,"When you pick up ""The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro"", you know that you haven't necessarily bought the typical 3-disc set where the first disc gives a documentary to explain the timeline and back stories of the matches you will see in the set. So it gets a bit confusing to have Diamond Dallas Page give monologues throughout the set about the history of the show as opposed to what a documentary can offer with many points of view over a chronological timeline.

I don't want to complain about the match choices too much, but it feels like if you are explaining the very best of Monday Nitro, the first thing you will notice is the omission of the ""surprise"" appearance of Lex Luger on the debut show, which I felt could have replaced Hulk Hogan v. Big Bubba.  I actually liked seeing the unique moments that happened in Monday Nitro history over the match choices.

If the DVD set meant to be ""The Very Best of Monday Nitro"", then it could have included more moments and fewer matches. Even as someone who started watching NWA/WCW in 1990, I had trouble getting into some of the match choices in the set.  The content is good enough, but I would recommend The Rise and Fall of WCW over The Very Best of Monday Nitro.",1307664000,3,1218,4.424107142857143
6034989,4,B00FWVXRNE,"The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro brought back some great memories of the greatest era in wrestling history but at times felt like a half-hearted effort from WWE.  In their defense, I suppose they were being careful not to duplicate The Monday Night Wars DVD, and if you asked me and 99 other WCW fans to compile a content list for this collection, no two lists would be identical.  But as host Diamond Dallas Page said, ""To condense six years into one production is a crime.""  There was really no way to completely satisfy fans with this set.

The 3-DVD set is a trip down memory lane that will leave fans wishing it was 1997 again.  It features many of WCW's most unforgettable matches and moments, both good and bad.  There were several things left out that I thought were important to the show: no matches or segments featured Raven's Flock, the cruiserweight matches featured just a few guys, there were no Nitro girls, and I don't recall a single match for the WCW World TV Title.

It would have been nice to hear from some of the former WCW stars besides Page, but unlike most WWE-produced DVD sets, this one didn't seem like there was a whole lot of effort put into it.  They just hired DDP to host and then inserted footage from their video library.

Overall it was well worth the price to relive WCW in its heyday and The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro is a must-have for serious fans.  I just hope this isn't the last WCW DVD set released.",1307491200,9,1449,4.393258426966292

6034991,4,B00FWVXRNE,"I just got my copy of WWE's ""The Very Best of WCW Nitro"" 3-disc DVD set and wanted to chime in with a review
of the actual product. First, there is some confusion out there because some of the reviewers here on Amazon
are listing this set as having these special features: Rey Mysterio vs Mr. J.L. and a segment called DDP Monday Nitro
Highlights. These two extras are only found on the FYE exclusive version, not the version Amazon, or any other retailer,
happens to be selling. The FYE version contains those extras along with a segment of DDP talking about being afraid
of heights the night Sting saved him from an nWo attack and they escaped via Sting's harness to the top of an arena.
These 3 extras are only found on the FYE exclusive version, which is limited! So with that out of the way, here's my review...

Being a longtime wrestling fan (I started watching in the 70s) I can tell you without hesitation that the mid to late 90s were
the best time ever to be a fan, thanks to the Monday Night Wars. As Eric Bischoff put it in a WWE Legend's Roundtable show
a few years ago, ""every Monday Night was like the Super Bowl"". It was an amazing time to be a fan because when WCW went
head-to-head with WWF Raw on Monday Night both promotions started pulling out all the stops to capture ratings and win
over viewers. You never knew from week-to-week who was going to jump from one promotion to the next, there was more
emphasis on actual wrestling, promos blurred the lines of fantasy and reality as stars called out wrestlers and promoters from various
promotions and you would get to see world class main events and dream matches on virtually a weekly basis. No doubt, the Monday
Night Wars burned white hot and this new 3-disc DVD set featuring the best of WCW Nitro shows highlights from the WCW side
of this now legendary era in professional wrestling.
Now, this set is titled ""The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro"", however this isn't always the case. My only complaint with this long
overdue look at WCW Nitro is that they included some pretty terrible moments here, that quite frankly, have no business being
on anything called the ""Very Best of..."". The DVD goes in chronological order and tells the history of WCW Nitro by showing
matches and memorable moments. I wish they hadn't gone this route because in giving a history lesson on Nitro, WWE has
included some moments and matches that are terrible. Why not just put together a collection of matches and moments that
are truly the ""Very Best"" from the show? This set could've been used to celebrate Nitro, instead it's a history lesson that includes
horrendous moments that should've been left out to allow for more memorable matches and moments to be included. For example,
WWE included the tedious in-ring speech from Vince Russo, Jeff Jarrett and Eric Bischoff in April of 2000 where they took the titles away from all
the title holders and hit the reset button on WCW. It's a long, boring segment of mic work that, while it does have historical significance (just
listen to what Russo, Jarrett and Bischoff say, and you'll know why WWE wanted to include this), it has no business on a ""Very Best of""
Nitro collection. Also, we have to see footage of Vince buying WCW and gloating over his victory of winning the Monday Night Wars. Vince,
we get it, you won! Why not let WCW and it's fans have their time to reflect back on Nitro without reminding everyone the WWE is the
dominate force in wrestling? Plus, there are a few matches I wouldn't have included here to represent the best of Nitro. Sting vs Ric Flair
from the final Nitro is important, again for historical significance, but it's simply a terrible match from these two. They wrestled better
matches on other editions of Nitro, why not include one of those? Sid vs Kevin Nash? Yeah, you get the idea...
With all this aside, this is a pretty good collection worth picking up. It'll bring back a ton of memories for fans like myself who tuned in
back in the 90s and will expose new fans to what the Monday Night War was like from the WCW side of things. Diamond Dallas Page
hosts the DVD and thankfully he's not WWE's corporate puppet in this one! DDP said in interviews leading up to this release that he
had WWE change the script that they wanted him to read because he felt it was loaded with BS. DDP doesn't introduce every match
or segment, but when he does talk, he gives an honest perspective on what was happening in WCW at the time. I can't tell you how
refreshing this is on a WWE produced WCW release!
So, overall this is a must buy for serious wrestling fans. You're going to get a collection containing, I would guess 70% of what I would
call the ""Very Best"" of Nitro, plus some poor historical filler, but the good out weighs the bad here. Sting vs Macho Man Randy Savage,
Rey Mysterio vs Dean Malenko, Brian Pillman vs Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger, Syxx vs Rey Mysterio, Bret Hart vs DDP, Hogan vs Goldberg, the
debuts of Scott Hall & Kevin Nash, Sting walking out on Nitro, Flair returning to the Four Horsemen, nWo taking over... these are all
great matches and classic moments! As I write this review, the DVD is listed in the top 40 of Amazon's overall sales chart. I'm hoping the
success of this release will convince WWE to release more Nitro and other WCW events (Clash of the Champions, Starrcade, Halloween Havoc, etc..)
because it's clear that fans still remember and respect WCW... even if WWE doesn't.",1307404800,72,5447,4.524340770791075
6034992,4,B00FWVXRNE,"They could have never satisfied me with this release. Unless they released every Nitro ever on DVD, this wasn't going to be enough. I'm very glad they are doing this though, as I miss WCW so much. Do I want more La Parka and Psicosis? Yes. Do I miss the inclusion of Benoit? Sure, but it makes sense. DO I wish Raven and his Flock were in at least one thing? Hell yes. Even with my picking, I'm preordering this now, and will love every second that I watch.",1303689600,4,457,4.146067415730337
6034993,3,B00FWVXRNE,"Generally with WWE releases, it's relatively easy to write a 'pre-review', usually in an honest attempt to warn even just one innocent child away from the latest 3-disc John Cena career retrospective, or to prevent yet another double disc D-X collection of ""hilarious skits"" from garnering unanimous 5-star reviews.
  This is different, however; this is 'WCW Monday Nitro', sacred ground for those youngsters who came of age, rasslin'-wise, during the epic Monday night pro wrestling wars. There's no question, Nitro, like Raw, was a streaky, hit-or-miss concept that made one fatal error BEFORE they made all the OTHER fatal errors that brought about their demise.
  Yes, before the 'Fingerpoke of doom', before the Reign of Russo, and most certainly before the reign of WCW WORLD CHAMPION Vince Russo (not to mention Mr. Courtney Cox), Ted Turner's trusted head honcho Eric Bischoff fell into a paralyzing trap: He decided that the number one company goal was to attempt to embarrass Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation; whenever that backfired, and it often did, he'd simply try to convince viewers through his own commentary and promos that the WWF was garbage, and WCW was the 'cool, hip' place to be. This was in lieu of what SHOULD have been the top priority: giving viewers what they wanted, which, as hard as it is to believe now, was once a McMahon specialty.
  Bischoff's constant WWF-bashing was bound to backfire; whether he was in babyface or heel mode, at no time did Eric Bischoff himself come off as 'cool or hip'. Meanwhile, over on the USA network, Jim Ross was using his likeability, innate skill, and superior wordsmanship and subtlety to dump on WCW just as much, and fortunately for an undeserving McMahon, no matter how hard the WWF Head tried to make Ross look like a backwater buffoon, JR was just too good at his job. Fortunately, McMahon eventually came to realize how much Ross meant to his company's success, and finally started treating Mr. Ross with the respect he had earned and deserved.....KIDDING!!! Actually, V-Mac forced Ross offscreen for having the bad taste to not be physically attractive enough in the Boss' eyes to CALL MATCHES, replaced him with the bland Michael Cole, and contributed to his own program's creative plummet. (For those unaware, this is NOT a Vince McMahon one time deal: some 10 years ago, he also fired looooong-time, and best-in-the-biz, Howard Finkel from his ring-announcing duties. Gone were the booming introductions that elicited huge pops and seething boos, but in it's place were soft-voiced, uninspiring vocals from the far from gorgeous, but certainly more facially appealing Lillian Garcia. Style 1, Substance 0.)
  Anyhoo, i tend to agree with some of the other reviewers' comments: stinks theres no Benoit, who had such a strong, if midcard, role for years on Nitro. But that was a no-brainer. It would be nice to see more Malenko, Jericho, Ultimo, Rey, and the rest of the guys who made thier PPV's watchable, at least until the final 2 or 3 main events.
  But really, who could resist seeing what's been collected on here again? With the exception of just about of all of Disc 3, naturally. So, enjoy. And as always, my little useless public service announcement, delivered only for my personal belief, and meant to offend or inspire nobody: If you must purchase McMahon-related DVD's, or ANYTHING created, manufactured, and sold by WWE, please, go bootleg. The vile, evil, slimebag who owns the company has more than enough of your money. Thank you very much!
PS-A reader pointed out to me that by urging folks not to purchase WWE-produced materials (as if anyone's going to take my advice), the only people that really suffer are the wrestlers competing on the DVDs who stand to lose out on royalties. That actually did tug at my heartstrings a little, just because of the amount of work, travel, and bodily harm these guys endured for so long; however, the reader's other admonishment directed at my 'thumbs-up' to black market alternatives fell on deaf ears. While I would love to see the wrestlers and other talent get paid for their work, 99% of my enormous collection is at least 15 years old, and never released. Meaning that the likelihood of so much incredible stuff ever seeing legal daylight is, at best, a toot in the wind.",1303171200,6,4321,4.923076923076923
6034994,4,B00FWVXRNE,"Nitro deserves a three disc treatment, I don't know about DDP hosting it though.

A very good look back yes tons of stuff is missing but you knew that would happen on this release and any release the WWE does covering NWA or WCW or JCP or any other promotion. However the good outweighs the bad overall ...yes the 3rd disc blows by the time we get to the 1999-2000 years by then WCW was doomed for failure especially with an idiot like Vince Russo running the show plus the merge between AOL and Time Warner the worst merger ever by the way! surely didn't help manners any plus when you blow through over 15 million dollars in one year something has to give. I miss WCW more now than ever for the simple fact BOTH WWE AND TNA SUCK!!! Oh well I least I can relieve The Monday Night Wars if even from my DVD collection. Buy this DVD still recommended with flaws and all. All good things must come to an end and Nitro was no different. Out Toddio",1301616000,,1168,4.289592760180995

Diamond Dallas Page Monday Nitro Highlights

While I understand the lack of Benoit matches, I cannot understand the lack of wrestlers like Malenko, Jericho, Raven, and Saturn. They were the backbone of Nitro and always put on the best matches. However, the set is 50/50 for me. Im excited for some matches but most of them are either released before or the same old wrestlers (Flair, Hogan, Mysterio)",1300147200,7,4094,5.072398190045249
