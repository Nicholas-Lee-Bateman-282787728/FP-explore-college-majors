8440684,4,B004TH78IM,"This is not the usual run-of-the-mill western. It is more of a who-dun-it, but without the clues and detailed investigation found in crime novels. Dana Andrews plays a gunman who was seen standing over a man shot in the back, holding his gun, the gun used to kill the brother of the woman he loved. The town tried to hang him, but he escaped. Now, three years later, after constant running from the law, he returns to find out who killed the brother and, if possible, resume his relationship with the dead man's sister. There are several possible suspects. Each wants to kill Dana, but do they want to do so because they are afraid Dana will kill them for trying to hang him or because they or one of them killed the brother? Also, why was the brother killed?",1434585600,,759,4.428571428571429

8440689,5,B004TH78IM,"This is a great western starring Dana Andrews and Donna Reed. This movie is about Dana Andrews character, Jim Guthrie who returns after three years on the run and currently has a scar on his neck. In the movie they show a flashback and in the flashback we learn how he was framed for murder. After three years on the run, he's come back for revenge and the Sheriff has allowed him three hour to do it.

This movie is in full frame, is in beautiful color and runs for about 77 mins. This movie also stars; Dianne Foster, Stephen Elliott, Richard Coogan, James Westerfield, Carolyn Jones, plus others and was directed by Alfred Werker who also directed He Walked by Night with Richard Basehart.

Overall Sony Pictures Entertainment did an awesome job of restoring this film on DVD (DVD-R). I only wished Sony had the time of the movie and aspect ratio on the back of the cover, in which they didn't. Overall, I would recommend this.",1343779200,9,930,4.529761904761905
