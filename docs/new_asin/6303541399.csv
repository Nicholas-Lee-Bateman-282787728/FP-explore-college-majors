679097,1,6303541399,"There are no Scouts in this movie. It is simply a movie about a man who thinks all outdoor activities (and those who enjoy them) are stupid. Bob Saget goes through the movie making snide remarks about everything, only to be proved that he is just a jerk. This film is titled incorrectly--the boy is not involved in Scouting, and the camp is not a Boy Scout (or any other kind of Scout) camp. This is typical of the smug view that anyone who enjoys boating, hiking, camping or fishing must be some type of backwoods redneck. Bought it used, tossed it in the trash after one viewing.",1240531200,3,581,4.388888888888889

679099,1,6303541399,"Four years ago, I received this movie for Christmas.  Boy, was it a piece of crap!  It should've never been made.  The acting was terrible, it didn't have a good plot, and all of FAS's characters made absolutely no sense.  I threw it away because it was so bad. I don't regret trashing it because I'm 100% happier without it. Do NOT buy this movie unless you enjoy watching garbage.",1126396800,,382,4.414285714285715

7850015,5,6303541399,"Here is a DVD production which is underrated because the real message can be missed.  Some Fathers are indeed city slickers who never had the experiences outdoors that are typical of an 11-year-old Boy who has been a Tenderfoot-BSA Scout.  Any Son has the desire to look to his Father - but - the hilarious theme of this production is a Father who is afraid of the dark, allergic to grass, scared of nighttime sounds - met with the protections of his Son.  Due to being nervous in the outdoors Bob Saget in the role of the Father has a hit parade of jokes proliferated with bad timing.  Brian Bonsall - in the role of the young Son Michael demonstrates how Father and Son can find each other to discover a good relationship.  With humor there are good, behavioral, moral lessons to be learned
in a Father-and-Son weekend on a camping trip.  That is the real value of this movie that a Father-and-Son relationship can find a positive new meaning.",1413158400,,945,4.529411764705882
7850016,1,6303541399,This movie is a disgrace to manhood. I cringe just thinking about this junk. The boy actor was great however; he was the manhood of this junk.,1396310400,,142,4.296296296296297
7850017,3,6303541399,"Film good quality, but storyline average.  If you are a Full House fan you might enjoy watching another of Bob Saget's films.",1391817600,,125,4.681818181818182
7850018,3,6303541399,"I saw this movie as a kid many years ago and loved it- thought saget was hilarious. Funny how now I'm a father and I see how hurtful much of his humor is to his son, which took away from much of the humor. It's heart-warming, if sometimes a little cheesy, and has a good ending all around. Of course there is a little cliff-hanging event to bring everyone closer. I'd recommend it maybe, but not one I'd recommend To buy. Although, I bought it because I couldn't find it anywhere to rent or borrow!",1366243200,,498,4.252631578947368
