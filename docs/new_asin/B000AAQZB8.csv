 This 1959 SciFi Movie Classic is a real Love-Story Tear-Jerker *wink, wink* with the required Giant Shadow Lobsters (called Gargans) chasing our protagonist; a lovelorn teenage alien who mourns that he has never known his family and finds himself in love with all things earth creatures; and his human girlfriend, Betty, all through the Hollywood Hills (although we're not told this is Hollywood).

 While trying to stop the Gargans from killing humans, they are also being gundowned by a fellow alien, Thor, who either A) has a gay love/hate crush thing going for Derek, our handsome teenage alien with the pretty lips or B) he just hates Derek. It breaks down to being that simple.

Thor brandishes a ray gun that turns everyone into a skeleton. When Skippy the dog turns into a skeleton during the finest act of the movie early on, it's downright hilarious ... and sets the tone for the following hour and so minutes.",1354924800,,1000,4.824561403508772
