470089,5,6302478081,"Yuval HaMevulbal (Yuval Shem Tov) is THE top Israeli children's performer.  Fun, great music, and easy to watch and listen to both for adults and children.  Yuval appeals to all Israelis--Jewish and Arab, secular and religious.  I have caught adults humming his songs in public, thinking no one would notice.  If your children understand Hebrew, they will love Yuval.

We have every Yuval DVD.  This DVD (Tov Litzhok/Good to Laugh) is one of his best.",1325635200,,451,4.946666666666666

He gets involved in the Fighting Dog Racket, but is eventually found by a the daughter of a wealthy man who breeds show dogs. Wildfire then becomes a Show Dog himself, and wins awards at local Dog Shows. He also finds out his father is a champion Show Dog. Eventually Wildfire finds himself competing against his father in a Championship Dog Show, he also falls in love with a Female Bull Terrier, who has his Puppies at the end of the Movie.

470091,5,6302478081,Few movies now days for the family to watch. This movie because it is about a dog and because there are not 4 letter words popping up. I enjoyed the movie altho I don't have children at home.,1322956800,,191,4.052631578947368
470092,5,6302478081,I can say this was thoroughly delightful! It was interesting to see how the bull terrier used to look (the egg head & erect ears of today were still being engineered) and the narration captured the true essence of the bull terrier.  Hard to find but worth every dollar if you are a fan of the breed.,1230595200,2,299,4.245614035087719

470418,3,6302478081,"This movie made in the early 1950,s was alright in production and story etc. If it is compared to stories made today however it does not fair well. If you are looking like I was for Joe Besser to be in this movie, you will be sadly disappointed, He is not and was edited out of thr movie as the second dog catcher. Its .a continued mistake by the advertisers.  This film is no Lassie classic but it is still watchable",1379289600,,417,4.148148148148148

470424,5,6302478081,"Came on time, of course and the DVD is excellent. The movie title says it all, it is about a British Bull Terrier and the life he goes through in England. It is actually narrated by the dog. Though there is dog fighting in the movie, it is pretty tame. The movie may not be for kids if you don't want to expose them to the world of dog fighting, otherwise, a great movie. I strongly suggest it.",1347408000,2,394,4.064102564102564
