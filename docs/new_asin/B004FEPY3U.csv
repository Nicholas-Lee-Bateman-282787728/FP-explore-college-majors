8610312,5,B004FEPY3U,"So bought this great DVD set at a great price but seems like I lost out on the shipping as one of the DVD's came scratched and would not play on my PC. The rest don't play on any DVD player as these are Euro specific DVD's but if you have a big screen hooked up to your PC like I do, this is not so bad. Just wished the packaging was a little better as you might catch bad luck like I did and get something unplayable.
The series itself is a true treasure for any test cricket fan out there, great in all departments, loved to see the poms get it right for a change and the aussies lose it at every turn :)",1340755200,2,606,3.8174603174603177
