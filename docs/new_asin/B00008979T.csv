1830304,5,B00008979T,Pastor Hezekiah and LFC are the contemporary choir of the decade.  Watching the performance live takes it to the next level,1121731200,,123,4.857142857142857
1830305,5,B00008979T,"I was so glad to get this video.  I am a dovout fan of Pastor Walker and his choir.  I especially love the movements that accompany their songs. I am a choir director myself and enjoy watching him direct the choir with very little direction. They are inspiring and I would love to see them live one day.

May GOD continue to use them as they minister to those in need of GODS love, mercy and grace.  GOD BLESS THEM ALL!",1105401600,5,419,4.135802469135802
1830306,5,B00008979T,"This came as no suprise to me, but this DVD is absolutely wonderful. As it implies, it is a greatest hits featuring some of John P. Kee and New Life's greatest performances of some of their greatest songs. This may not be a good investment for someone who owns all of their previous videos, unless you want an easy way to see the best parts without flipping through several videos to do so. My favorite parts include the ""Wash Me"", ""Jesus is Real"", and ""We Walk By Faith"" performances. It is also amazing to see the progress and change of the choir and John throughout the years. I can't stop without mentioning this: Dorinda tore it up on ""Strength"" but what else can be expected from a Clark! As always, anything with John P. Kee in it is truly a blessing and anointed by God. Hallelujah!",1069113600,22,790,4.417808219178082

1830329,5,B00008979T,"This DVD by Hezekiah is evidence of his early greatness when he first came on the gospel scene.
It contains all of the essential elements of his musicianship and performances.
He is able to bring out the best in his choir and make the performance enjoyable for all who watch/attend.

It is evident that Hezekiah and the choir enjoy the performance themselves.  This translates into high energy and pulls the audience in.
I recommend this DVD highly.  It does not disappoint.",1397174400,2,474,4.827160493827161
1830330,5,B00008979T,"I am a huge fan of John P Kee and this only confirmed why I am; this was an amazing DVD. It appeared to be many concerts on the dvd, as there were wardobe changes and in some parts the kids appeared to be older. No matter when the concert was taped, the message was still fresh and new and they sounded amazing delivering it. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who love some good gospel sanging - yes sanging because they SANG!!!",1379462400,,431,4.142857142857143
1830331,4,B00008979T,The song selections are wonderful.  They are everything that you would expect from a great choir and they are great!  I wish that it wasn't pieced together. I think that interrupted the flow. It is a great purchase though and worth the money.,1376179200,,242,4.604651162790698

1830336,5,B00008979T,"This DVD ministered to me like no other DVD has ever done before.  I've always admired John P. Kee's work, but something about hearing his choir with a live band behind him really makes it that much better.  There are 13 different performances from 6 different albums and I watch about 10 of them over and over again.  If you want to listen to some uplifting gospel music with great vocals, this is the DVD for you.",1126310400,9,415,4.363636363636363
