1650357,3,B00005QW5S,"The H3D didn't work on my Pioneer PDP-502 MX Plasma display. It has a NTSC scaling DSP that I think is causing loss of sync with the LCD shutter glasses. I think that any TV that has a line doubler or some sort of scaling technology will not work with H3D.
The effect was terrific on the JVC CRT television that I have in the bedroom.",1028073600,3,334,4.075757575757576
1650358,2,B00005QW5S,"The 3-D effect is poor at best.  Common televisions scan/refresh rate is too slow.  Each eye gets only 15 frames/second which is too low for fast motion.  Even direct view CRT televisions show ghosting of images to wrong eye.  The phosphors just don't have time to cool between frames.
THE ANIMATED CONTENT ON THE INCLUDED DVDS IS TERRIBLE.  Same roller coaster/mine train theme repeated over and over and over.
One of the movies does have music video of live persons. Unfortunately it is ruined with lame floating bubbles and ghosts.
Live humans in actual settings would be much more enjoyable to watch. First person point of view presentations of anything would be preferable to the garbage I just finished fast forwarding through.",1027123200,,733,4.975409836065574

1650360,4,B00005QW5S,"I first saw ""Encounters..."" at the local Imax 18 months ago and was so impressed by the 3D that I swore that ""one day I would have this at home"". Now I have and (apart from not having a 3 storey high TV) am thoroughly satisfied.  It is a bonus that the kit works with more than the supplied DVDs :)
The movies are little more than a showcase of the talents of a 3D ride company - which is openly acknowledged in the extras.  Accepting the nature of the software, you can't fail to be impressed by the quality of the mainly CGI images rendered in screen popping 3D.
But where is the scene with the owl and the police car from the Imax ""encounters...""?
One tip I will offer...
Most people sit quite close to the screen to get a more immersive feel - after all exceeding your field of vision is the whole idea of the Imax originals.
Everyone I've shown this to has agreed that the 3D improves with distance.  So get a headphone extension lead, dim the lights and sit further back.  Yeah the picture is smaller, but it's also  deeper ;)
Six to Eight Foot (two to three metres) works brilliantly on my 28"" TV.
Incidentally, one addendum to the review by megadume and the comment on the official site of the glasses that shutter glasses Don't work with 100hz and/or digital TVs.
I own a Sony KV-28WSU 100hz Digital Plus TV (it says so on the front) and the 3D works brilliantly - the above comment delayed my purchase by a few weeks until I had checked it out.
A brilliant pack, a brilliant price, now we need more films!

and purchased it . I ordered it on a Thursday and got it the following Tuesday. How's that for service? When I opened it up ,it took me maybe 15 minutes to hook it up , the instructions are easy and clear. After all was hooked up, I poped in one of the DVD 's (It comes with 3) Plugged in the glasses . The video started and I remember syaing to my self ""well this is ok "" Then the real 3-D kicked in and I was blown away. It was the quality of what I experienced at Universal Studios. In the instructions ,they give you a couple of different web sites to purchase additional videos and equiptment. I showed it to my wife and she loved it too.

1650362,5,B00005QW5S,"Turn out the lights, don your 3-d glasses, and get ready for an AMAZING experience that is unlike anything you have ever seen in your living room! Let me start out by saying the glasses are top-notch technology...complete shutter 3-d glasses...no old-fashioned red and blue cardboard here! And for those of you that are amusement-park goers, darkride fanatics, and basically fans of blockbuster entertainment...you will LOVE this box set!! Start off with the introduction to 3-d with ""Through the 3rd Dimension"" and let your eyes relax and start focusing on how 3-d brings the illusion to reality! Although it's got some corny dialog and b-movie acting, you'll be treated to oldtime movies and clips from when 3-d was invented, some clips from theme park attractions like T2 and Mine Cart, and a whole simulator ride that lasts for a few minutes!! Next you've got ""Haunted Castle"", a 3-d visual darkride! Now ignore the pointless story and look at the incredible visuals because this is an adventure that truely brings you INTO the scene...once you step through the door after hearing the ""devil"" give you his offer of fame and fortune GET READY for breathtaking graphics, loud 5.1 surround sound, and twists and turns that take you through everywhere from haunted churches, spooky caves, and dungeons filled with 3-d realistic skeletons that are locked in cages that actually LOOK like actual cages...the depth is there and everything!! Over 25 minutes of dropdead 3-d visuals and maybe 10 minutes of lame filler...still an AMAZING RIDE!! And then last but not least is ""Alien Adventure"" where once again the story is stupid but the actual simulator rides are INCREDIBLE! You are treated to 4 different rides at this new high-tech amusement park...an Artic ride that shoots you down a crazy tobaggan ride through the snow...a Magic Carpet ride that takes you through a magical journey inside of dark tunnels and Indiana Jones-type passageways complete with incredible 3-d effects and splendid music...a simulator ride on a kid's roller coaster that he built in his room complete with toys, loops, MASSIVE details, and lift hills with realistic inclines and stomach churning drops...and finally an underwater ride that is complete amusement park real! Starting in an actual amusement park complete with lights, a ferris wheel, carousel music, and signs on both sides of the car! After dropping into the water you'll experience a trip through a  pirate ship, bubbles that can FEEL, a tiki island with a roller-coaster-like hill, and 3-d DETAILS that bring you into the scene...there is so much amazing visuals on these dvds that you can watch them over and over and see different little details you missed before!! PLUS all in computer-generated 3-d theme park style!! It's quite an amazing journey and the glasses just make it even better...if you lift them during one of the rides and take a look at the screen you'll see just how flat the regular tv screen looks! This is a 3-d adventure that everyone out there should experience and it's somewhat pricey but the visuals you'll watch more than make up for it!!! Pick this up and get ready for an INCREDIBLE 3-D RIDE EXPERIENCE!!!!",1017446400,40,3182,5.003773584905661
1650363,5,B00005QW5S,"Read some of the previous reviews for the details of setting up.  But, it was very easy.  1st the bad part.  There seems to be ONLY these 3 titles (that come in this package).  Let's hope there are more.  Now the good news.  This 3D WORKS.  It's ALMOST as good as being at the Imax theater.  I have a DVD player and S-VHS TV, so it does look really good.  However, the room must really be dark to get the full impact.  A little pricy, but it includes everything!  If you're a 3D fan, get this thing!!!",1014163200,9,501,4.061855670103093

1650365,5,B00005QW5S,"I've always been fascinated with the idea of 3-D movies.  I remember my first experience was when a TV station broadcast one of the red/green 3-D films when I was a child, and I convinced my folks to go get the silly cardboard glasses at the store that was promoting it.  With great anticipation, I sat down at the appointed time, put the glasses on over my own, and squinted at the TV.
Didn't work.  Not at all.
Still, I couldn't get away from the idea.  Some folks have eyes that are more easily fooled by this sort of 3-D, but I don't.
Then one day many years later, I saw that IMAX was advertising a 3-D movie, and I thought I'd try again.  This time, I was handed special glasses that had LCDs that alternately blocked out the vision of either eye, to ensure that only the correct images got through.
Wow!  It worked!!!  I was finally able to experience the true 3-D effect, and it was great.
Believe it or not, this product actually includes two pairs of glasses (that my own glasses comfortably fit over) with the same LCD technology, a simple box that connects between the Video Out of your DVD player and the Video In of your TV (using the simple RCA jack connections) to synchronize your glasses to the DVDs, and three different DVDs to get you started (Encounter In The Third Dimension, Alien Adventure, and Haunted Castle).  The DVDs even have director's commentary tracks!  In addition, the first of these three titles provides a fun introduction to the history of 3-D in still photography and film.
If you have any interest at all in 3-D, you have to own this.  The people at Slingshot Entertainment have managed to put this product together and make it work in your home, and I have to say that I have NEVER been happier with any DVD purchase I have ever made (and I've made a few.)
This would be a wonderful gift for anyone that loves DVDs, 3-D, the technology of film, or all of the above.  There's nothing even remotely like it.  Buy it--you won't be sorry.",1007337600,57,1975,4.425414364640884
1650395,2,B00005QW5S,"If your buying this hoping that the 3-D will pop off your screen...You WILL BE DISSAPPOINTED...As I was...I read some reviews saying that it does and some that it doesn't...Believe, me...IT DOESN'T...And that was the main reason I purchased it...But one thing  it does do: The 3-D is within the screen...There is just depth...You will notice objects in front of each other...AND THATS IT.....It's slightly better than the Red/Blue glasses, except for the fact that the picture is clearer, but alot darker than what your actually seeing on screen without the glasses on...The content of the DVD's are SO uninteresting...The only thing that kept me watching was the anticipation of the 3-D possibly ""popping out"" of the screen...And once you realize this isn't going to happen, it's all downhill from there...The sound is EXCELLENT if you have a 5.1 or DTS surround system......The flicker from the glasses is really annoying at first, and takes a bit to get used to...Make sure to turn the lights off...This system HIGHLY recommends using a TV with a refresh rate of 100hz or better....90% of TV's have a refresh rate of 60hz, like mine and yours(Check the label on the back of your TV and look for either 60hz or 100hz, every TV shows this info..) They don't tell you this in the product description or in the 1 page instruction manual...Had to do a little research for that one...So the higher the resfesh rate, the less flicker....

All in all...

If your buying this for the 3-D to ""Pop Out"" off the screen like in the IMAX theaters or amusement parks....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

If your buying this already knowing that you will see ONLY depth within the screen with an annoying flicker, then maybe give it a shot....But don't say I didn' warn you....

**Also, if your expecting to recieve your system in the Nice Black Box shown above...That's not going to happen either...It comes in a plain white box with a shipping label on it...**",1175731200,16,1965,4.784660766961652

1650397,4,B00005QW5S,"The 3-D set it comes with. So you can watch other types of DVD's like these.

The movies that came with these must have been the worst ever. Bad acting seems to come to mind. Plus are all generic. But there is a plus in all this.

The 3-D! Really good. Compared to the crappy Spy Kids 3-D red and blue glasses! The effects come right off the screen. Let me put the DVD's in order from best, to worst.

1) Haunted Castle: 3-D EFFECTS ARE AMAZING. The story makes no sense from time to time and is really boring without the 3-D. Music is also good.

2) Encounters of The Third Dimension: This DVD had some good 3-D effects. The train scene comes to mind. Wow. But again get's boring. It has a stupid scientist who has some weird fantasy with Elvira. A floating robot who seems to be the only good thing in this. And Elvira pops into the story every now and then with a catchy song. They all try and teach us the History of 3-D.

3) Alien Adventure: DUMB, DUMB, DUMB. No story. Well there is but I don't think anyone cared for it. It is just Aliens in a theme park going on a bunch of nausiating roller coasters. BORING. 3-D is okay.

Anyway this set was worth it. I can't wait to watch more 3-D things like this.",1142467200,7,1210,4.127659574468085
1650398,1,B00005QW5S,"The kit was not worth its price. The spatial effect is poor. I've been watching some much better 3d movies with much cheaper red-blue paper glasses.  No, I don't have visual problem, and I rigged up everything correctly.

The DVDs itself were not interesting. My kids were not impressed much. It were not made me happier with the pack.

Sorry this review seems against the others, but it is my truth. I've stored it back into the box.

I don't recommend this for you.",1132185600,10,467,4.523809523809524
1650399,4,B00005QW5S,"After seeing ""The Haunted Castle"" on the huge IMAX acreen at Moody Gardens in Galveston, TX, I was left wanting more. When I found this collection on Amazon I jumped at the chance. Yes, it does work in 3D just like at the theater, of course limited by screen size of the television but things really do fly into your lap. Frankly. I was amazed at the technology. Sure, the glasses are a bit cumbersome but that was expected. They do fit over my regular glasses and I have had a blast with this system.",1126310400,11,501,4.28421052631579
1650400,1,B00005QW5S,"This DVD 3-D Box set, is great to add to any collection.

It is more focused on bring computer effects to life.

I have been to Imax and can advise that the effects are just as good.

Only 1 BIG problem:

If you are luckly enough to own a projector or Old TV set around 5 years or older. You should be able to set back and enjoy.

For some unknown reason the 3-D Box set WILL not work with HI-END TV's or most Plasma screens out today.

If you buy the Box set, be carefull, as the set is VERY unlikely to work with your screen.

1650403,4,B00005QW5S,"The first thing you should understand about this package is that it's not a set of videos of cheezy 3d movies using red/blue 3d glasses. The package includes a pair of LCD shutter glasses which enable you to view full color 3D on your TV, and a synchronization box which connects the glasses to your DVD player. The glasses are attached by wire. (The wires were nicely long and an extension was included in my pack.) You may find that things look a bit darker than usual while viewing through the glasses... increasing the brightness of your TV and turning down the lights should make things look normally bright again.
The 3D effect is excellent. The enclosed three DVDs were essentially designed to show off the 3D more than anything else. ""Encounter in the Third Dimension"" is a pseudo-documentary about 3D technology. It's not very interesting, but has nice visuals. ""Alien Adventure"" is strictly an excuse to have lots of nice 3D animated scenes of an amusement park. ""Haunted Castle"" has a frame story to make an excuse to have a long stream of animated scenes of a haunted house. Of the three, Haunted Castle is the best, with superb animation and excellent 3D effects.
This set is a great way to get started with 3D video. I found the hardware to be a quality product as well. I liked it enough that I sent a set to my cousins for christmas.",1072396800,8,1349,4.578512396694215

1650435,5,B00005QW5S,"If you are a fan of 3-D, then get this package!! First off this is not the ORDINARY 3-D you know! There are no flimsy cardboard glasses with the RED and BLUE lenses here. They are shutter-glasses. These glasses are STATE-OF-THE-ART technology!  The hook up is very easy. Even if you own a Playstation 2! Make sure you are in a well-darkened room. The reason is you will notice a flicker from the glasses in a lit room. So remember the darker the better...LOL! The 3-D is SPECTACULAR!! And it WORKS!!  Now don't let the price fool you.....THIS IS A SERIOUS PIECE OF 3-D HARDWARE! The SOUND is like .....WHOA!!! You have to have Dolby Digital Surround Sound system in order to get the FULL effect of being immersed in the synthesis of the 3-D! Also another suggestion is get a projector! It heightens the effect GREATLY!!!

  To begin your 3-D journey I suggest you watch the DVD's in this order:
1)Encounter In The Third Dimension
2)Alien Adventure
3)Haunted Castle
  Why? Well, because it will keep you, the viewer, wanting more! And you will want more even when its over...lol The effects in each of the DVD's are AWE INSPIRING!
  The first DVD, Encounter In The Third Dimension with Elvira, is a sort of HISTORY of 3-D. This gives you an orientation as to what 3-D is and how it came about.  Although the storyline and the acting is terrible, the 3-D massively makes up for it. The opening sequence is astounding! Check out that part where the title comes on.....you'll LOVE IT!! There is also a snippets form amusement park rides. Look at the Terminator-2 3-D ride snippet where the liquid metal mechanized droid blows up and the fragments of it seem to be suspended in mid air! VERY COOOOOL EFFECT!!

  The second one, Alien Adventure, goes a step further. The effects in this one are much better! And it shows off more of what this type of 3-D can do! You the viewer are put on various types of simulated rides with your green little partners. There is a rollercoaster, which is very gut-wrenching, a magic carpet ride, and a few more! Hey, I don't want to spoil for ya!! there are some funny moments in it too. The aliens almost look like the ones from the movie Mars Attacks!
  Now, the last one, Haunted Castle, is by far THE BEAST out of all 3!! Visually its BEAUTIFUL!! I actually jumped on some sequences!! Absolutely mind blowing! One thing for you to pay close attention to is....once again, the opening title sequence with the bird on the tree! Look at the DETAIL!! You'll know what I mean when you see it!!
  Be the envy of all your friends and own this sophisticated 3-D hardware! You can get more DVD's on the web-site printed on your instructions. Your skepticism will be a thing of the past!! BUY THIS.....NOW!!!",1061337600,14,2731,4.552147239263804
1650436,5,B00005QW5S,"I got this as a Christmas present, 2002!! I love it. Go to the website listed on the dvd case and you can buy more dvds really cheap. (Slingshotent.com) I bought Jaws 3-d off of Ebay and it was good also. Make sure when you buy 3-d movies that they are used with your shutter 3-d glasses that you get with this kit! NOT The OLD RED AND BLUE GLASSES. Oh yeah.. You can hook it up to your VCR to watch 3-d tapes.. Such as Amityville Horrors.",1059523200,9,439,4.0
1650437,4,B00005QW5S,"I've been a huge fan of 3D technology since I was a child.  I cut my 3D teeth on television broadcasts of ""Revenge of the Creature"" on our local television station.  Unfortunately, the 3D effects were quite muted or didn't work at all.  Then the 3D movies came back to the theaters (Friday the 13th in 3D, Jaws 3D, Parasite, Comin' at Ya!, etc.).  Many of these were R rated, so I couldn't get in to see the earlier ones.  However, the ones I DID see blew me away, especially because they used polarized lenses instead of the obnoxious blue/red lenses.

Once the VHS revolution took place, you could find the odd 3D ""creature feature"" on tape.  The 3D effects on these were better than the broadcast versions of my childhood, but not much.  Finally, DVDs came along and upped the notch a bit with better resolution, but still, something was missing.  The 3D just ""kinda"" worked.

NOW, however, we have the Imax-type ""shutter"" glasses for home use.  Incidentally, this is not new technology as you might guess:  The old Sega Master System videogame console of the early 80s had similar shutter glasses for it's line of 3D games.

The shutter glasses (two pair) come bundled with this DVD box set, and FINALLY great home 3D has arrived!  The effects are truly amazing.  It's not without its faults, however.

First off, although the company also makes WIRELESS glasses, this box set comes with the wired model.  Also, the three movies here are geared toward younger viewers.  All three movies are computer generated and most of them are filmed in dark environments.  There is a reason for this:  when brighter scenes are viewed, there is a noticeable ""flicker"".  This flickering is caused by the fact that each lens shutter is openning/closing rapidly (left lens  open/right lens closed, and visca versa.).  This is more noticeable in the more brightly-lit scenes.

Also, the three films are fairly weak and short in duration (about 30 minutes).  The most interesting one is Adventures in 3D, with Elvira (although her presence seems pointless).  This ""documentary"" covers early 3D movies, the various 3D processes and incarnations over the years.  As an adult, I found this very interesting, although the introductions between each segment are overlong and annoying (some guy behind a futuristic control panel arguing with a snarky floating robot).  However, the 3D effects really shine in ""Alien Encounter"", where space creatures end up invading a closed amuzement park and take several roller-coaster type trips.

The system is hooked up to your DVD in this manner:  There is a ""decoder"" box that has in/out RCA jacks on it.  This box is connected between the DVD player and the TV.  The glasses plug into this box.  I guess the decoder box helps synchronize the left/right lenses of the glasses with the left/right alternating images on the TV screen.

One nice thing about the system is that there are more movies out there that will work with this system.  Also, there is a 3D camcorder lens available from this company that works with this system so you can make 3D home movies!  How awesome is THAT? (And it really works--I bought one and have been really geeked about it!).

In any event, a very interesting gadget, one I was so impressed with that I bought a second set as a graduation present for my nephew recently and he was pretty impressed as well.  4 stars for the package, as there are still some technical issues to be resolved for 3D home viewing (i.e., the flickering mentioned above).

Pick up ""Spy Kids 3D:  The Extreme 3D Edition (HQFS)"" and/or ""Transitions 3D"", recently released and they work with this system.  Very kewl.  I have also recently picked up the HQFS version of Santa vs. the Snowman here at Amazon.  Check my 3D movie list I generated for all of the titles I am aware of for purchase here at Amazon (the list is longer than you might think!).

***There ARE other FS (field sequential) movies out there, as well, but they take a little research to find.  I have come across Andy Worhol's Flesh for Frankenstein, Jaws 3D, Friday the 13th Part III in 3D, Creature from the Black Lagoon, House of Wax, It Came from Outer Space, Dial M For Murder, and others.  Most of these underground versions can be found at auction sites or elsewhere on the web.",1059436800,6,4282,4.733423545331529

1650440,5,B00005QW5S,"Wow! It is indeed a very realistic 3D effect!  Achieved with my simple DVD player and smaller 27"" TV!
I stumbled across the Ultimate 3D Collection by accident.  I was captivated by the IMAX theatre presentation of ""Haunted Castle"" (THAT is something to see in 3D on a HUGE screen with mammoth sound), and in particular the music of Jesper Haverlinck featured on the soundtrack.  While surfing for info on the soundtrack, I discovered the IMAX 3D film is available on DVD!  Included in the package were the Haunted Castle is was hunting for, and two additional 3D features also filmed in IMAX format.  Add to that some very simple hardware for your entertainment system, and you have a fantastic 3D effect in your living room.
Now initially I was impressed, even with the 27"" TV in my living room, but when I took the package over to my buddies with the big screen and big sound, we were all simply amazed.  At this date, I'm still trying to get the 3D system back from the buddy.
The only minor drawback to this system?  The short wires from the glasses to the video-sync box.  This is easily corrected by simple extension cords available at your local electonics shop, or better yet, by the available wireless glasses!",1039305600,5,1219,4.611111111111111

The 3D effects are genuine and will amaze.  Did you know it also works somewhat with other movies?  Yup!  Try it on Star Wars Episode I and you see another dimension of the movie.  It dosen't pop out of the screen, but the detail is so astounding that it looks like you are on the set while they are filming..(not a homevideo, but you are actually there and see all the detail)  So far, I found that it adds to all the Jurassic Parks, LOTR, and pretty much any movie that had seamless blending of CG and live action.. AWESOME ON TOY STORY! Anyway, to cut my story short, do not contemplate jsut purchase.  You will not be dissapointed.  Oh, and try watching TV with them, they add a little to that as well.  Must be seen to be believed.",1033948800,4,1060,4.183168316831683
1650442,4,B00005QW5S,"These three films, all produced by Slingshot Entertainment are wonderful displays of 3D computer imaging.  Slingshot has also released several IMAX films on DVD that were originally shown in 3D and I sincerely hope that one day they release them in 3D formats as well, and who knows, perhaps classics like the Creature from the Black Lagoon, or Captain EO (rumored to be released in Japan on 3D DVD in 2003).
The Haunted Castle is by far the most satisfying disc.  Very much like a cross between Myst, the 7th Guest, and The Mind's Eye, I will be playing this one at my Halloween party this year!  Alien Encounter was fun, and Encounter was a short overview of the history of 3D, I only wish they'd shown more clips from films.  The clips that are included are quite small as they were intended to be on an IMAX screen.  A great set.  My only real complaint: The inserts states the films range from 30 minutes to 2 hours.  However, they are each roughly 35 minutes long.  This is a good length, as most people's eyes can't take more 3D in one sitting.
This set comes with field-sequential glasses, which are far superior to the old red and green analglyph glasses!!!!  They use liquid-crystal lenses which flicker rapidly between right and left images. And I am certain there will be more releases in time that use this format, therefor the glasses will not sit around unused after viewing.  The glasses are by Razor 3D
Tube TVs have better quality color and definition for this format, but I have a 51"" projection TV which works fine.  Best when viewed in a dark room, which makes the flicker much less noticeable.  A must have set for 3D enthusiasts!",1033344000,5,1652,4.562711864406779
1650443,4,B00005QW5S,"After I saw my first 3-D film at the I-MAX I fell in love with 3-d technology! When I first saw this kit I was in dout that such technology could work in the home, but I was wrong! The 3-D is superb. The explosive title sequense and teriminator 2 3-D on the DVD ""encounter in the 3rd dimension"" are worth the money alone. But all of the DVDs have great 3-d effects. It was extremely easy to connect to my DVD player and TV and is easy to operate as well. I highly recomend ""The Ultimate 3-D collection"" to ANYONE!",1029542400,2,513,4.089108910891089

7951016,3,B00005QW5S,If you only have a analog tv and somehow do not have a digital tv or even better a 3-d tv then this package is for you.  But I don't know anyone in 2012 who doesn't have a flat screen tv. Or even a flat screen computer screen.  This was  a great deal back in 2001 though. And it cost alot more than it does now. But you are better off buying a 3d tv these days.,1338768000,,361,3.6623376623376624
7951017,4,B00005QW5S,"You can pick the system up for literally nothing and it comes with 2 pairs of LCD SHUTTER FOCAL GLASSES [it gives an address to order more.] This system hooks up in the stereo imput not HD. I have a first generation projection TV, and for the most part, it is incompatible with projection TV. This is odd since theater movies are projection, but works with cathode tube TV [a friend uses them with a LCD 3D TV with no complaint].
But if you have one of the new 3D TV'S, these glasses are top notch and well made. From the parts of the demo movies that I could get to play it was incredible. This system originally sold for $750, but the company went under, and you can get it for $70-$100. Don't waste your time on the red and blue glasses, or money from the manufactures for their 3D glasses. IMAX glasses ARE the best thing going and at $25.00 cannot be beat. You simply push a button on the glasses and it ""captures"" the 3D signal, its that simple.",1293926400,,951,4.230769230769231
7951018,2,B00005QW5S,"I got this, based on the ""rave reviews"" everybody had.  Was so excited and hooked it up, set it up per the menu, popped corn, sat back, tunred off the lights and ""WTF?!?!?!"".  The picture was so blurry it gave me a screaming headache in ten minutes.  Sure there are some decent 3D effects here and there, but the picture quality is so god awful it made it tough wading through the rest of the movies to get to the ""good parts"".  I truly hope the new technology that is so freaking expensive is better and it damn well better be since I just dropped  afew grand on a widescreen setup and ma waiting for the glasses.

So, wait for my next review of the ""new"" 3D technology.  For an HONEST average guy opinion.

In this average guy's opinion, this one sucks.  Some nice effects, but an almost unwatchable picture.  I'd say wait for the next wave to catch on and prices come down a bit.....that or buy my setup like this one.  I'll sell it really cheap, ha ha ha.",1291852800,,959,4.2430939226519335

I showed the movies to my friends age from 9 to 55+ and they all tried to reach out and grab or duck from some thing in some part of the show.  This is the real 3D home system!  Do make sure your Movie is the only light source while you watch otherwise the flickering from a constant light will give you a headache.",1248566400,3,478,4.0
7951021,4,B00005QW5S,"I received this collection a few days ago and have to say I am really pleased with the 3D, especially on ""Haunted Castle"".
Personally, I couldn't get the shutter glasses to work via my PC and projector and what I saw on a normal TV wasn't great 3D and flickered a lot, enough to distract my enjoyment. So, after a bit of Google-ing, I discovered that there was software around called ""Stereoscopic Player"".  I downloaded the demo and with a bit of fiddling found that I could view these movies in the old anaglyph method using this software. So for those people who can't get the shutter glasses to work try this system. It really works.
I opened ""Haunted Castle"" in ""Stereoscopic Player"" and set it the following way..""View Steroscopic"".....""optimized Anaglyph red/cyan""
and I set the video decoder settings to ""weave"".  I also experimented with the right/left eye settings to see which was best.  Let me tell you, the 3D was stunning. Sure the colours are slightly lost using the anaglyph system, but for ""Haunted Castle"" that doesn't matter. The depth of field is amazing and the objects ""do"" pop out of the screen, believe me.
So for those having problems with the shutter glasses, try the ""Stereoscopic Player"" on the above settings and enjoy the amazing 3D world that you'll enter.
I am now officially a 3D addict!!",1227052800,3,1321,4.759825327510917
