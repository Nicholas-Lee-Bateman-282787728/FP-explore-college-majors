1951,5,0310894913,This DVD was perfect. It really does a wonderful job getting to the why's of not allowing ugly things into our spirit. We are fragile and complex at the same time. We should allow only good and positive thoughts in our minds. I am going to purchase many more of these for gifts. This DVD helps to learn how to practice protecting innocence.,1376352000,,340,4.412698412698413

7788041,5,0310894913,"We are using Soul Detox as a group study. The video that goes with it is interesting, but it would be possible to do a good study with just the book and study guide. Part of what has made it so relevant is that Craig talks about things that we all do or have done, and speak to us about the decisions we make every day. We recommend it!",1408406400,2,336,3.8840579710144927
