8397937,5,B003J7HOAA,"The current fashion is to thank veterans for their service, place yellow ribbons on tree limbs or human limbs and wave or wear a flag. Since we have been at war 8 years, there has been little else. Many of us have not been affected by war, or distracted by it because we keep sending the same servicemen and women back into combat again and again.

Fortunately, there are in-depth documentary programs like Frontline, an award-winning program from WGGB-TV in Boston that is widely distributed to PBS stations across the country. This past Tuesday, the program examined the effects of war on our soldiers and what it has done to them physically and psychologically. It was first aired May 18, 2010.

They follow soldiers from one platoon of the 1st Bn. 506th Infantry out of Ft. Carson, Colorado that had recently returned from combat in Iraq. The officer asks the men if they have any problems and if they feel they need to get psychological counseling. None of the men volunteer. To macho-driven men who just survived combat, they might have well been asked if they were gutless wonders.

The conflicts at home begin. Many in the platoon have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and don't know it, as some engage in criminal activity, or find solace in drugs or alcohol. Many are separated when they fail drug testing. They are now completely on their own, with no help from society or the Veterans Administration. The army has its own conflicts to manage, namely to keep boots on the ground and maintain readiness for the next deployment back to the combat zone. Those who redeploy find themselves on new kinds of drugs, ones prescribed for them to keep them alert, and drugs to let them sleep. This is supposedly verboten in a combat zone.

This episode shows how much our government, our military and our citizens have let down the fighting men they praise through indifference and ignorance. While Frontline episodes are rather expensive, and I can fairly well guarantee you won't want to see it twice, it is available, free on their website.

Please see this sobering story because it is not enough to wear a flag or a ribbon. The troops we send over deserve much more.",1296432000,4,2170,4.73015873015873
8397938,5,B003J7HOAA,"Okay wow...this is a classic DVD by far next to ""ASK NOT"" (concerning don't ask don't tell). I'm a Iraq veteran and bisexual yes i said it and im proud of my five year service to this country. I put this DVD in my top 10 of the year because of the following: One, I can relate to alot of these guys. When a soldier comes home the Gov't is trained to be nice on the outside, but due to the regulations, the Gov't is trained to make a soldiers life a living hell. Two, I was not honorably discharge from the armed forces.

Just Like NASH, I had some issues and tried to inform my Commander; however, they were more concerned with ""stop-loss"", inventories, and promotions rather than the morale of the unit. So last year, i got discharged just like Nash and same status. Three, this DVD taught me ""the military may kick you out of the service, but won't kick the service out of you."" Meaning I and alot of vets won't forget what the crap we've endured and how the shafted was given to us. Since I been out I've been fighting for more benefits by applying to the Discharge Review Board because I know anyone who serves his country for a few months to a year and a half in a foreign country, deserves the uttermost respect. Forget the ""Support the troops"" logos, put it into action. CLASSIC DVD!!!!!!!!!",1285891200,2,1298,4.319672131147541
8397939,5,B003J7HOAA,"This documentary was shown on BBC TV late one night early September 2010, but was not available for sale in Region 2 format.

Basically the documentary shows how American soldiers suffered chronic psychologically damage as a result of the USA army leaders' negligence in dealing with wartime stress experienced by ground force soldiers in the Iraqi war. Army personnel responsible for their soldiers' mental health spout a whole lot of excuses as usual. Nothing was learned from previous wars because they basically don't care (as usual, and will never care). The fundamental cause for this illegal war, which caused damage to American citizens doing the fighting, is the greed of the plutocratic sector in American society. (A plutocracy is a government by the powerfully rich for the powerfully rich.)

The documentary shows a series of interviews with the affected soldiers who give account of their experiences and feelings. These first hand accounts are nicely interwoven with related images filmed during events where American soldiers were fighting in Iraq. It also shows the eventual fate of these soldiers when they had difficulty re-adapting to the ""normal"" society to which they returned from the war.

I give it 5 stars to push up the unjustifiable average star rating force upon it by another reviewer.

Pity the Brits can't get it in Region 2 format (at the time writing this).

8397940,3,B003J7HOAA,"One of the earliest troops to go to Iraq in this recent war killed many and saw lots of their peers die.  When they returned to the US, there was much suicide, homicide, drug addiction, inter alia amongst them.

One Army personnel claimed, ""This is a war like no other.  We did not know how these soldiers would be affected.""  That surprises me as much of what was covered here is what happened to Vietnam War vets.  The work does imply that the military did these men wrong.  However, it doesn't slam the institution.  This will make one ask, ""When should structural forces take the blame and when does personal responsibility kick in?""  No one forced these vets to commit crimes, but the powers-that-be did not invest enough in fighting PTSD.

The work has a long conclusion.  It showed a vet who was overcoming his problems and a vet who was not given an honorable discharge and is struggling greatly.  It is mentioned that about half in this platoon returned to the US and lived typically normal, tax-paying, law-abiding lives.

The progressive in me does wonder if Obama's administration is tackling this issue in many ways that the Bush Administration failed to do.  Perhaps this can be a lesson learned.  Even those with no connection to the military may want to see this as many folk have PTSD.  If you enjoyed this, you may want to see the late 1990s film ""Dead Presidents"" alongside it.",1281225600,,1396,4.640816326530612
