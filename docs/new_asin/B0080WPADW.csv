5116800,4,B0080WPADW,If your fond of Samurai movies this is great one to see. I was very impressed with the movie it has a great story based on some of the history of Japan. The movie keeps a good pace with the action (the sword play is great) and the actors do a great job and there is even a little bit of humor throw in there. A great buy and definitely should be added to any ones collection.,1344643200,10,375,3.883116883116883
5116801,5,B0080WPADW,"Years ago, I had purchased a bootleg of this film on VHS. Over the years, I had re-watched it several times and I've always enjoyed it. I definitely recognized it as a classic. However, there seemed to be some ""rough"" spots. Eager to upgrade and support legitimate companies, I ordered the new DVD release. Wow!  What a difference the new translation makes. It was like watching the movie for the first time!

Not only does the film tell the story of ""The Last Samurai,"" but the film also represents the end of an era of epic films. The cast is uniformly great. Ogata Ken giving a standout performance. This film has such a great cast, there's no way that this film would be produced today. It would simply be too expensive to assemble all of these stars in one movie.

The DVD comes chock full of bonus materials. Short of an audio commentary, I would be hard pressed to list any bonus features that were left out.

A true classic of the genre that is given the presentation that it deserves.",1343260800,13,993,4.469613259668508
5116802,5,B0080WPADW,"Based on Amazon's recommendation, I ordered both Kenji Misumi's THE LAST SAMURAI and Hiroshi Inagaki's SAMURAI TRILOGY.  I've always been a big fan of the ZATOICHI and LONE WOLF AND CUB films.  So, I was pretty interested in checking out THE LAST SAMURAI.  I was floored.  I could not believe that I had never heard of this movie.  It's Epic in every sense of the word.  I was really shocked at just how good this movie was.  The film follows a group of characters during the last days of the Shogunate.  The film does a beautiful job of conveying the development of these friendships.  That's not to say the film is light on action.  There are probably at least six major fight sequences in the story.  It just makes it all the more gripping when you actually care about the characters.  I was also surprised at how strong a role the female characters had in the story.  Though she is not top billed, Ayako Honami gives an amazing and poignant performance.  This movie is FIVE STARS all the way.

BONUS MATERIALS!  I almost forgot to mention the DVD supplements.  After watching the film, I started through the bonus materials.  WOW!  45 minutes later I there was still more to learn about this film.  I had to stop for the night and finish the next morning.  Neptune Media definitely went all out on the supplements.  The last few Criterion releases I have purchased were pretty light on the bonus materials.  So, it's nice to actually feel like I got my money's worth.  I only wish I could read the novel that the film was based on.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1342483200,21,1557,4.534296028880866
5116803,4,B0080WPADW,"Disclaimer:  please ignore my less than stellar grammar ... with that out of the way ... Ill try to keep this spoiler free ...
Being a huge fan of 60s, 70s and 80s Japanese cinema, I was very surprised I had never heard of this gem from 1974.  Directed by Misumi Kenji (Lone Wolf and Cub and Zato-ichi fame) you would have thought it a no-brainer for this to have been released in the US back in the glory years of DVD (late 90s to mid 2000s) .. when so many other classic Japanese films made it to DVD here (Lone Wolf and Cub, Zato-ichi included).
When I heard that this was directed by Misumi, I just knew I had to see it ... I mean, who didn't love Lone Wolf and Cub?  I have to admit something:  the first Japanese Chanbara film I ever saw was the hack job Shogun Assassin .. say what you will about it, but this movie made me love the genre.  And who doesn't think its the greatest film ever when they see it at age 16?
Anyways ... going into watching this 2:40 minute movie I was expecting something akin to Lone Wolf and Cub (for no real reason): stylistic visuals and insane amounts of flying blood and body parts.  Imagine my surprise when the film turned out to be a far more serious reflection on the end of the shogunate period, and a far more restrained piece of film-making in general.
Yes, this movie has a few decent large battles, and yes it has some signature Misumi gore (I have to admit feeling out of place).  But what really makes this film standout are the performances by the 3 main male characters: Toranosuke (Takahashi Hideki), Hanjiro (Ogata Ken) and Hachiro (Masaomi Kondo).  Especially the chemistry between Takahashi Hideki and Ogata Ken is fantastic.
There are many standout scenes, but two I felt are especially worth mention: the friendly sword fight between Toranosuke and Hanjiro (awesome) and the tea house scene with all 3 together including Okita Soji (played by Saigo Teruhiko).
The tea house scene is probably my favorite part of the entire movie .. the chemistry between the characters working brilliantly.  Heck, its not even an action scene and its just excellent.
If you love classic Japanese cinema .. you should see this film.  Is it perfect?  Nope.  There is some gore that feels out of place, and it sometimes feels like it needed to be 4 hours long.  But its still an excellent movie with fantastic performances by the leads.

Lastly I want to point out:  the DVD release is good .. the picture quality is probably the best you can expect from a film of this age without a massive restoration effort, and the sound is passable (which I believe is the original mono track).  Its a shame that a sound remix and video restoration cost so much that its not financially feasible for the genre.",1342483200,11,2738,4.47887323943662
8523830,3,B0080WPADW,"The main theme , i.e. ""Shogunate time is over, let's get done with those senseless killings between different Samurai clans and wait and see what comes next with the Meiji era along with modernization of Japan"".  For the sake of dramatization, however, some scenes, i.e., parts of the scrip border on the absurd ! The most glaring one is the killing of the hero's wife ! That villain who kills her is not just a street vllain. He is a Samurai, member of the ruling group at that point in time. At one point, his eyes catch sight of our hero's wife on her way home from the market place. Along with his foot soldiers he orders those underlinks to stand guard while he gets into the house and eventually killed the woman after she refuses to his advances !  A high ranking Samurai involved in such lawlessness ?  He does not know  nor does he want to first know  who that woman is ? To the advances of the villain, the woman does not even know to simply say :""Wait ! Don't you know who my husband is ? "" ?  ( A short time later, when the husband ran out to look for those culprits, upon seeing our hero that villain was struck with horror and runs for his life. Only to be cut in half all the way from the skull to the genitals a few minutes later by the enraged husband !  The thing is  without the villain's attack on the woman, there could not be any swords plays afterwards !  The scriptwriter sometimes does not care about common sense. They aim for the sensational, no matter how senseless that might turn out to be !  That's why story lines in movies light ""The twilight Samurai"" is so classy ! ( Also available on DVD on Amazon as well, by the way ).",1521504000,,1656,4.195583596214511

8523835,5,B0080WPADW,"The end of the samurai era finally comes to a close. Although I did like the 2006 movie, this is not your Tom Cruise type of Hollywood movie. It follows the ending of the Tokugawa regime, the ending of the Bakufu military government and beyond. We see the once valiant samurai transforming ~ or should I say, adapting ~ to the new Meiji period. It's a long movie, 159 minutes, but it goes by quickly. I highly recommend adding this to your DVD library as you will want to watch this one over and over.",1373846400,3,501,4.28421052631579

8523837,5,B0080WPADW,"Master filmmaker Kenji Misumi, best known for directing numerous films in the classic Zatoichi, Nemuri Kyoshiro, and Lone Wolf and Cub movie series, saved his best work for last in this epic and glorious film, which he finished shortly before his untimely death. Neptune Media's release was a long time coming and it was well worth the wait. Everything from the print, to the subtitles, to the Essay by Tom Mes, and the Film to Novel Comparison is top notch. A must own for any fan of Jidai-Geki/Samurai films.",1363564800,7,510,4.741573033707865
8523838,5,B0080WPADW,"Drama, martial arts, and a conflict between good admirable characters fueling how the characters grow and change as The Age of The Tokugawa ends, and The Meji Era begins.  You will see some great chambara action, characters maturing as history passes that form a well paced cinematic masterpiece.  While I loved it it should be noted that the film could be hard to follow if you aren't a Japanese history buff.  I highly recommend this film.  One of the best ever made!!!!",1357257600,2,472,4.719512195121951
8523839,4,B0080WPADW,This was much better the tom cruise version. They should make movies like these more often. I would recommend this movie to the samurai fans.,1355011200,3,141,4.68
