920661,5,6304610629,"Like the other two reviewers of this mini-series, I found this to be an excellent, moving, gripping history of World War II.  This series, as well  as the previous series, Winds of War, should almost be required viewing for  today's generation of high schoolers.  I would also like to point out a  mistake in the otherwise fine review by the fan from Brockport, NY.:  Ali  McGraw is not dead!  The actress who played the first Natalie is very much  alive.  I will refrain from making a joke about Ali McGraw's character  dying in ""Love Story,"" because how can anyone mention ""Love  Story"" and ""War and Remembrance"" in the same sentence?",941155200,,636,4.681818181818182

Ordered the series from local library and they worked/played. We even bought a new DVD player to try and get the ones we tried to purchase to play.

920740,4,6304610629,"Well done and poignant.  Fizzled out at the end.  I was disappointed that some of the actors from the first series, ""The Winds of War"", were unable to continue their roles.  I especially missed Ali McGraw as Natalie Jastrow.  And where did they fnd all those beautiful vintage automobiles?  And why were all the protagonists on our side a bunch of alcoholics and heavy smokers?  Maybe it was a characteristic of the time and culture but it was a bit much.

920743,4,6304610629,Liked it so much passed on to son.  Had difficulty getting the final chapter which was a unnecessary problem for purchasing.,1391299200,,124,4.904761904761905
920744,5,6304610629,"""War and Remembrance - The Final Chapter"" comprises Parts VIII-XII. In an earlier set, the series contained Parts I-VII.

For those new to this series, I would advise watching the prequel ""Winds of War"" which is also available on DVD. ""War and Remembrance"" begins about a week after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and once again viewers get to see the various members of the Henry family. Victor ""Pug"" Henry (Robert Mitchum) assumes command of the U.S.S. Northampton, whilst his eldest son Warren (Michael Woods) is a fighter pilot on board the U.S.S. Enterprise. Byron (Hart Bochner), Pug's other son is a torpedo officer on a submarine. Byron misses his Jewish-American wife, Natalie (Jane Seymour) who together with their infant son and famous uncle Dr. Aaron Jastrow (Sir John Gielgud) are trying to evade the deadly Nazi web, though events will soon enough conspire against them. Meanwhile, Berel (Chaim Topol), Aaron's cousin is a Soviet POW who ends up in the Auschwitz concentration camp.

In Parts VIII-XII, we see the conclusion of this epic mini-series as the lives of the Henrys and the Jastrows play out against the backdrop of the war. The implementation of the Final Solution sees the destruction of European Jewry made all the more harrowing through the credible portrayal of Natalie, her young son and uncle Aaron and their collective suffering (it follows them from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz). The depiction of the Final Solution - mass shootings, gassings, etc is one of the most realistic and horrifying depictions of the Holocaust ever portrayed on screen (the other shows that come close are Holocaust, Amen, and Schindler's List, amongst others). The depictions of Nazi brutality are quite gruesome and I would advise caution against showing this to children under 12. Viewers get to see the leaders of both sides (the Allies and the Axis powers) - FDR, Churchill, Hitler, etc. make historic choices , and the eventual conclusion of the war.

This is an epic mini-series that is memorable and will forever remain a classic of its genre. Highly recommended.",1391126400,,2087,5.061046511627907

Some of the major actor's have been changed, but their characters go on, so if you can accept that, you will enjoy this one too.  I, personally, found the end very emotional as I always do when I see what happened all those years ago.  The quality of these are good, but pricey.

920827,5,6304610629,"I am a WWII buff and watch any movie or documentary with a WWII theme. This purchase was definately worth it. There are multiple love stories mixed in with WWII military themes that will keep you glued to the series. I enjoyed watching the story line of Hitler interacting with his Generals and his final days in the bunker when the Russians were closing in on Berlin. Also the scenes at Auschwitz were horrific.

My only criticism that those hoping for a HD broadcast will be disappointed as this series was shot in the 1980's and was not remastered as far as I can tell. This is strictly an SD (Standard Definition) broadcast. Watching this on a large screen HD telvision will reveal the SD limitations but the story is well worth it.

Maybe someday it will be remastered and released on Bluray?

Still well worth watching.",1325289600,2,825,4.598639455782313

920891,5,6304610629,"I found this final series exciting and deeply satisfying. The previous two parts (Winds of War, and part one of this) called very strongly for completion, and that is what we have here... IN SPADES! I found the same wonderful sense of historical perspective that I noted in my review of part one... I felt I had got an overall grasp of the essentials of a very important and complex period, but also, that I had seen, spelled out in graphic detail, the results of the concentrated arrogance, stupidity, and self-indulgence that the Nazi ideal foisted on this suffering planet during that time. Nothing in my life so far had prepared me for the absolute horror revealed in this coverage... and nothing, I am sure, will ever allow me to forget it... which is really good. This lesson in the consequences of selfishness comes at an opportune time. The sections on Theresienstadt and Auschwitch, were particularly forceful - the sheer heartlessness and purposeful cruelty of those in charge will remain with all who see this, as a salutary moral beacon... dangerous reefs beneath the surface of our common human nature.",1217808000,3,1115,4.873684210526315
920892,4,6304610629,"This review applies to the entire miniseries. I watched parts of WAR AND REMEMBRANCE when it was first broadcast 2 decades ago. I saw the DVD collection at my local library and decided to watch it again in it's entirety.

I did not see WINDS OF WAR so I can't compare the performances of Ali McGraw to Jane Seymour, John Houseman to John Gielgud, or Jan-Michael Vincent to Hart Bochner, but I will say that Seymour and Gielgud give 2 of the greatest performances I have ever seen, and in fact those performances, as well as the whole Holocaust story overshadow everything else in this series. It is quite amazing that Dan Curtis could get this vision of the genocide of the Jews on TV in an unexpurgated form. Many of the scenes were filmed on location in Auschwitz. Those death camp scenes, the Babi Yar massacre, the final transport scenes, are the most harrowing things I have seen relating to that period. More harrowing than what Spielberg presented in SCHINDLER'S LIST.

I would recommend WAR AND REMEMBRANCE simply for it's angle on the Holocaust. The story of the Henry family, the war in the Pacific, and the whole Hitler episode, was well done but nothing outstanding or unique. Mitchum was nice and understated as Pug Henry. Polly Bergen did a good job as his wife. The whole supporting cast was fine in their respective roles, although I thought Berkoff's take on Hitler was almost comical in it's exaggerations; more caricature than anything else.",1216771200,4,1460,4.744094488188976
920893,3,6304610629,"Very good but not as good as the original (Winds of War).  There was so much Auchwitz, it was very hard to watch.",1215993600,2,113,3.9130434782608696
920894,5,6304610629,"For sentimental reasons,  I rate the Herman Wouk epic Winds of War - War and Remembrance as my favorite theatrical account of WWII.  It's hard to say why.  Certainly, it has been surpassed on a number of technical and acting fronts by newer mini-series like Band of Brothers or Ken Burns ""The War"".

I think the reason I and many other members of the over 50 generation are so loyal to this series [I'm on my third viewing], is that Wouk's books were for many of us the first beginning to end account of WWII. In short, we were in love with the Henry's before the series came out. The TV mini-series is faithful to the book, largely because Wouk served on the writing team.

To date, even the ""Why We fight"" chapter of Band of Brothers cannot compare with W/R holocaust thread.  The holocaust thread does not enter  Band of Brothers until Chapter 9 - when Easy Company liberates a concentration camp.  Likewise, The War does not attempt to follow the holocaust thread so intimately.  In Wouk's series, we see the holocaust from beginning to end in all it's forms.  And we live with several characters who live and die through it.  The scene where Aaron Jastrow, played by John Gielgud, gives his final lecture at Teresenstadt, is as riveting as TV gets.

For me, the fictional Henry saga makes the series.  It gets you emotionally involved with people living through the war.  It gives characters a chance to debate and react to wartime events.

If you are looking for a greater emphasis on combat and war or a completely non-fiction account, the Burns series is for you.  If you want a well-rounded education on WWII - get all three.",1214697600,5,1634,4.563573883161512

920954,4,6304610629,"I wrote a review back in 2000 based on the VHS version (It still shows as on the of top three most helpful on Part 1 of W&R). Now that I have upgraded to the two-box set of DVDs I would like to address some of the comments made in other reviews:

Was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Winds-of-War/dp/B0001NBNGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Winds of War</a>&nbsp;better? Absolutely! Which I find very interesting because in his forward of the book Herman Wouk wrote that Winds was mostly a prologue for the story he really wanted to tell, which was W&R. So in book form, War & Remembrance was the masterpiece that Winds set-up but in film Winds was the true classic that W&R became a lesser sequel to.

Was Robert Mitchum too old for W&R. A resounding yes! In my original review I state ""If there is any downside to this series it's that Robert Mitchum is just too old here for the part of Pug Henry. In Winds he seemed to fit perfectly, however by the time Dan Curtis got to filming W&R Mitchum had begun to truly look his age. It's a small distraction, but it's there none-the-less."" The more I watch this film, the more of a distraction it is. And yet, I couldn't imagine another actor in the role. Mitchum does a great job in both Winds and W&R.

Which of the Byron and Natalie actors did the better job, Jan Michael Vincent & Ali McGraw or Hart Bochner & Jane Seymore? In my opinion, it's a split dedision. Although in my original review I gave the nod to Bochner, as I watch both Winds (I upgraded to DVD there too) and W&R I've realize what a great job Vincent did in bringing Bryon to life. His passion, his stubborn streak, and even his hidden devotion to his father. You really see only the angry Byron in Bochner's portrayal. As for the Natalie character, Seymore wins hands-down. To me McGraw never felt right in the part, although her acting was great. Seymore, on the other hand, owned the part.

Which of the Germans were the best? Again, Winds without a doubt. The actor who portrayed Hitler in Winds was magnificent. In fact, the only saving grace for the whole German Contingent was Jeremy Kemp. His portrayal of General Von Roon was almost the only thing that made the German scenes worth watching.

920982,4,6304610629,"This 6-disc set concludes the turbulent story of `War and remembrance' miniseries, based on the successful book by Herman Wouk, whose predecessor, `Winds of war', was shot five year prior to this, in 1983. Made during a 5-year period on location in 10 countries, `War and Remembrance' thusly remains one of the biggest achievements in the history of television. The story comes to an end with this 11 and half hours of footage, covering the period from November 1943 to summer 1945.

The main plot of this last part mostly concerns the final stages of the holocaust. Again, we see it through the characters of Natalie (Jane Seymour), an American Jewess, and her uncle Aaron (John Gielgud), who after many escapades across Europe ended up in Theresienstadt, a Nazi ghetto in occupied Czechoslovakia in summer 1943. The so called `paradise ghetto' turns out to be a monstrous hoax: an overcrowded place filled with sickly and dying Jewish people, many of whom were sent to Auschwitz on the regular train transports. The Theresienstadt scenes (shot in my native Croatia) show some of the most brutal holocaust-related moments: a very disturbing scene where Aaron is beaten in front of Adolf Eichmann (Milton Johns), one of the highest ranking Nazis responsible for the implementation of `the final solution' and the one where Natalie's small son is almost tore in two in front of her. We also get to see the famous Red Cross visit to Theresienstadt in June 1944. The Nazis allowed this visit and tried to deceive the visitors, by implementing `the great beautification': the false stores and cafes; furnished houses and hospitals, putting some of the residents on display, etc. However, all this pales in comparison to the episode where Natalie and her uncle are put on the last train from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, in October 1944. What follows is one of the most gruesome and most vivid depictions: a long and for some fatal trip to Auschwitz; the arrival and the selection (who goes to the camp and who to the gas chamber); the procession of the able bodied prisoners (that is, Natalie) and the very end of her uncle (undressing and dying in the gas chamber). These exterior scenes were shot on location on the exact spots in the actual Auschwitz-Birkeanau camp (first time to be done so) and are deeply moving and disturbing and because of that are not suitable for the small children. This remains the most detailed TV account of the holocaust until today.

Besides this, the story also wraps up the subplots concerning the fictional characters from the Henry family (the love between Pugh and Pamela, for example). The historical events are covered, albeit with less live footage and space (D day; the atom bomb, whose implications of use are strangely left untouched and the whole thing is only mentioned). Considerable space has been given to the July plot to assassinate Hitler in 1944. Sky Dumont (who had a cameo in `Winds of war' as the Italian foreign minister Ciano) is excellent in his portrayal as Count Stauffenberg, the tragic and dignified leader of this failed attempt.

Most of the cast continues their persuasive job (Robert Mitchum, Polly Bergen, Jane Seymour, John Gielgud, Ralph Bellamy...). However, the same problem from the first DVD set is painfully obvious, that is, the character of Hitler. In `Winds of war' Hitler was played by the late German actor Gnter Meisner, who played this role a few times during his career. Although a bit too old for the role, he managed to keep things under control, so despite the fact his Fhrer was stiffed and not altogether perfect, he gave a hint of the evil personage Hitler was. Here, however, the role is taken by the British actor Steven Berkoff and he did an awful job out of it. According to the interview on the extra disc, the director Dan Curtis wanted Hitler to be overplayed. The reasons remain unknown, although one can guess that he wanted to downgrade the character more by doing this. Berkoff's Hitler is a mixture of a buffoon and a yelling maniac. He portrays these sides in such an overacted manner that the result is anything but believable. This makes the Hitler scenes really uninteresting to watch and the way he behaves with his inner circle has no trustworthiness at all. Therefore it is hard to believe such a person could put a spell on the entire nation, let alone  be listened by his generals, most of whom are shown here as the observers who put up with him. The role of Hitler is a hard and yet manageable task for an actor who can make a character, as shown by Bruno Ganz in the recent movie `Downfall'. The same difficulty is evident in case of Robert Stephens, who plays Karl Rahm, the SS commandant of Theresienstadt, in the manner of a cartoon villain.

In the same way, the same slip ups from the first disc set are also present here. The most noticeable concern is the narrow scope used in reference to the holocaust, i.e. by showing it to be solely and exclusively a Jewish matter. There is no doubt that the Jews suffered far worse than any other nation, but the subject matter cannot be understood without mentioning all the other groups that suffered under the Nazis. Here there is no reference whatsoever as to all the others that perished in Auschwitz and other places: Slavs, Jehovah's witnesses, Gypsies, homosexuals, etc. This is something that should not have been done in the series of such importance and scale. The book and the movie `Sophie's choice' (where, incidentally, the same actor played Rudolf H, the commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp) recognize this problem by showing a Polish woman caught in the tragedy that is holocaust. Another evident thing is the fact that the authors tend to be too biased: the subtle message is all Americans are totally honest and good in each step of the way, while all the Germans are bad and vicious. Some of the scenes and lines are quite unnecessary. For example, the Germans on the train to Auschwitz are shown in the stereotypical form as a bunch of beer-gobbling goons. At the same time, the exhausted Natalie says in her boxcar: ""I am an American and I will survive."", like one has something to do with the other. The same thing can be said about her line in the last episode, when she is describing a dead friend to her husband (who is a gentile himself), by saying: ""His heart was in the right place for a gentile."" A bit more of objectivity would be more than welcome.

One of the DVD-related problems is the fact that some of the spelling is incorrect, especially German names and phrases. Thusly Morrell became Mller and Roon is subtitled as Rohem. The German phrase `Zu Befehl', which means `As you ordered', is wrongly subtitled as `To be fair'.

Despite all this, the series remain more than plausible for anyone interested in World War II fiction. The bonus DVD includes another behind the scenes documentary with the cast and the crew (the difficulties of getting permission to shoot at Auschwitz, a homage to the actors and crew people who died since filming...); director Dan Curtis' comment of the selected important scenes and an interview with Bob Cobert, the composer who wrote the memorable score for the series.

920986,4,6304610629,"I did not see this series when it originally aired in the late 80's.  I had seen Winds of War, however, and -- at that time, I loved it.  Now, when I purchased the DVD's, both series seem somewhat dated and the acting stilted at times to the point of being a distraction.  I particularly have trouble with accepting Robert Mitchum as a virile, intelligent, sombre, alert and perceptive, about 50-something Pug Henry.  I wish some filmmaker (Curtis would be great!) would do a REMAKE of this entire project -- making it into a 4 hour feature movie -- tightening up the script entirely (apologies to Mr. Wouk who wrote the teleplay) -- mostly keep in the historical scenes--but more realistic battle scenes especially those at sea-- and do away with some of the long, soap opera dialogue scenes.  Keep the Holocaust part intact --these were the MOST powerful Holocaust scenes I've EVER seen and I've seen most of them; but have someone like Kevin Costner be Pug Henry (or Harrison Ford).  And find a truly young, very vibrant Natalie (an actress who has a commanding yet somehow innocent presence), and a gorgeous, rather naive rebel leading man to play Byron (Briney).  We need to feel their chemistry -- otherwise, what transpires (Briney's desperate attempts to find Natalie and his son) seem over-wrought and contrives.

921046,5,6304610629,"...The entire ""War and Remembrance"" sets surpasses ""Winds of War"", if that can be believed.

A sleeper performance was Sky Dumont's portrayal of Count von Stauffenberg, Hitler's would-be assasin. He was faithful with Mr. Wouk's intentions, Mr. Curtis' intentions, and this world's historical record. Can you imagine the severe tension and anxiety that the Count experienced as he was arming the bomb, and, later making his getaway? Dumont did it all so masterfully!

The cinematographer's choice of raw film stock, and the techniques that he used to expose that stock was even BETTER than ""Winds"". You don't need no stinkin' airline ticket nor cruise ship ticket to experience Italy, Corsica, Poland, and unfortunately Theresienstadt.

And this segues to a stern warning to the overly sensitive viewer. I'd rate the depictions of Nazi brutality as strong, if not stronger than ""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", or George Takei's (""Star Trek"") portrayal of a sadistic Japanese POW camp commandant in a production that eludes me right now. The brutalizations of Natalie and Aaron; the gassings, with full frontal nudity, which, as I recall, were the same as I remember in the original ABC TV telecast; the SS's additudes that their conduct was a ""funny"" thing; and SS man Blobel's flashback of his Babi Yar Massacre participation. This was as close to the real thing as it gets and it's NOT for the timid. For a gutslamming juxstaposition, consider ""Lady"" Aster's actions on the Big Submarine Raid.

All of you fellow Mitchumomaniacs, you'll just love the way his ""Pug"" takes complete charge when faced with the extreme hazards of naval combat. Yeah, Pug finally got his ship!

I'm a stickler for continuity, so when they touched off the Trinity A-Bomb shot, instead of Trinity stock footage, they used footage of OPERATION HARDTACK H-Bomb footage from the late 1950's, for some strange reason (more psychedelic to view, I suppose). I believe that there IS full color footage of Trinity in existence.

Jane Seymour's Natalie had a strange complimentary quality to Ali McGraw's Natalie, emphasizing the changing circumstances the character found herself in -- no time for the frivolous, more time for the serene and somber, pointing towards potential martyrdom.

Every time I view the death of Dr. Jastrow, played by Sir John Geilgud, I cry. He really made you love the old man.

As some of you out there may also know that Dan Curtis also produced the vampire soap opera ""Dark Shadows"", please keep an eye out for Dan's production assistant, Barbara Steele, as party hostess Elsa in Singapore. Barbara Steele was a ""favored victim"" in the Hammer House horror pics of the '50's-'70's. In the 1991 NBC-TV revival of ""Dark Shadows"", she played the role of Dr. Julia Hoffmann (role pioneered by the late Grayson Hall), the erstwhile healer of Barnabas Collins' (Ben Cross, role pioneered by Jonathan Frid) vampirism.",1132790400,9,2919,5.092050209205021

The scene is a country road, and in the distance we see an auto approaching.  It comes closer and closer, then closer and closer -- and then turns a corner, and you see the car driving away down another road.  You see it get farther and farther away.  The irritation one feels from reading that description is repeated throughout the film.

In the novel(s), Pug Henry was an athletic, formidable (though short-ish) man in his early fifties, and credibly could have commanded the affection of a younger woman such as Pam Tudsbury.  Robert Mitchum simply did not -- but, the high quality of the film in other respects overpowers that one casting problem.",1118620800,6,905,4.875816993464053
921050,5,6304610629,"This entire movie but specificially the parts 8-12, are riveting for anyone who has studied the Holocaust.  The scenes of prisoners being beaten during morning roll call, standing outside in snow and below freezing weather, returning from 12 hr workdays carrying the days dead is all too realistic.  The sequence showing Himmler observing a routine gassing in the converted farmhouse is chilling indeed.  Anyone who has read and researched the details of how more than 1 million were gassed will see for themselves how the sequence progressed.

At times the story is a bit muddled when dealing with Natalie and her Uncle.  Certainly any normal person would have taken steps to escape the tightening noose earlier, but the movie follows the book. When the train car door is opened, and the SS officer screams at the Jews inside you feel like you are standing there with the prisoners. You can see the hate in the guards face, the actor playing the part of the SS is completely into his character, and absolutely seems to despise the jewish prisoners he is transporting to Auschwitz.

The affair between Pug Henry and Pamela is hard to believe because of the large age difference, but I suppose they needed to flesh out the romance part.  Such things may well have happened during those times, the world seemed upside down.  Years ago the movie ""Shoah"" came out and covered actual participants/witnesses to the holocaust being interviewed.  Now a person gets to see what just a tiny part of those terrible years was like.  This is as real as ""Schindler's List"", and hard to watch at times.

921053,5,6304610629,"War & Remembrance is an exception to the rule of TV Miniseries- either good or forgetable.  This one blows all of them out of the war, like many of the ships in this film.  The story is of the Henry family, US Naval officers and their loved ones thrown into the four corners of WWII.  Captain Victor Henry (well done by Robert Mitchum) is the Patriarch thrown into the battles of Midway, Guadalcanal, Leyte Gulf, and others, the political infights of Washington, Lend Lease to Russia, and in England with the Allies.  His wife Rhoda (Polly Bergen)is the matriarch with the wandering eyes for family friend Palmer Kirby (Peter Graves from Stalag 17 and Mission Impossible). There is daughter Madeline Henry (Leslie Hope), with CBS and the USO. Sons, Warren and Byron are young naval officers thrown into the maelstrom of the Pacific War (Michael Woods as Warren and Die Hard's Hart Bochner as Byron).  Byron is doubly troubled since his wife Natalie Jastrow Henry (Jane Seymour) and his son are trapped in Europe, along with great uncle and writer Aaron Jastrow (Sir. John Gielgud), both being Jewish and the infant half-Jewish.  The Jastrows are forever pursued by the SS and Nazi Foreign Ministry seeking to exploit Aaron, a US citizen living in Europe, to speak against the war.  The pursuit continues in Europe, with Byron getting updates from his father Pug, and a US Diplomat and agent Leslie Slote (David Dukes).  The war forms a crescendo of true events with these characters and real figures woven into this mix.

The historical detail is well documented.  The sequences of the Holocaust are chilling.  Much of the concentration camp segments were filmed at the actual Auchwitz extermination camp.  There Aaron's cousing Berel Jastrow (Topol of Fiddler on the Roof) is imprisoned, and later escapes.  There is reenactments of inspections by SS Leader Himmler, the gassings, evacuations, and even the medical experiments are alluded to.  There is also the massacre at Babi Yar and the unearthing and burning of the victims' bodies.  Commandant Rudolf Hoess (Gunther M Halmer, also Hoess in Sophie's Choice with Meryl Streep) of Auchwitz and SS Colonel Blobel (Kenneth Colley of Star Wars) of the Babi Yar massacre are portrayed chillingly and all too humanly.  Monsters with families, but willing to do the unthinkable and using terms like processing and units in reference to extermination of 6 Million souls.  There is also a foreman played by John Rhys Davies.  All are part of the darkest chapter of the 20th century.

Much is made of the Pacific war, but Wouk did focus on Natalie and Byron much, and of course Victor.  Victor is not free from war or duty, and even has an affair with Pamela Tudsbury (Victoria Tennant), the young daughter of friend and reporter Alistar Tudsbury.  Thus Victor is in London and Moscow everytime she is, not always on purpose and sometimes fated.

The rich tapestry of this film is well done.  There are some big names, but many picked due to their resemblance and embodiment of actual figures- Churchill, FDR, Hitler, Himmler, General Eisenhower, Patton, and others.  The battles are not so much focused on as much as personal conflict, but it does well with the narration.

This is a collector's items for die hard historians and fans of the old sweeping epics of yester-year.  This is one worth finding, if Paramount redoes these for sale, like they did Winds of War, the prequel to this story. War & Remembrance is a worthy investment of time and money.",1091145600,,3501,4.871621621621622
921054,4,6304610629,"WAR AND REMEMBRANCE - THE FINAL CHAPTER is the conclusion of the trilogy that started with THE WINDS OF WAR and continues with WAR AND REMEMBRANCE VOLUME 1.

Unlike the first two parts of the story, the conclusion narrows in scope to focus much more on the lives of Natalie and Aaron, as well as Byron and Victor, leaving behind much of the epic saga of world war seen in the first two parts.  Even the bombing of Hiroshima is only mentioned in passing, while the story focuses on Byron's search for his son.

As was the case in Volume 1 of WAR AND REMEMBRANCE, the Holocaust is depicted with graphic reality, and can be quite painful to watch.  However, this is one of things that makes WAR AND REMEMBRANCE so important -- current and future generations need to see this reality, to make sure this can never happen again.

Why the two parts of WAR AND REMEMBRANCE are packaged separately is a mystery to me; both parts must be seen in order to get the whole story.  But the entire epic saga is well worth watching and re-watching, so I heartily endorse all parts of the story.",1090713600,17,1077,4.414141414141414
921105,4,6304610629,"Herman Wouk's ""The Winds of War""-""War and Remembrance"" miniseries ranks as one of the greatest miniseries ever.  ""War and Remembrance, The Final Chapter"" is about 11 1/2 hours of viewing, and concludes the story with the conclusion of the war.  I rate the whole miniseries a solid 5 stars, but after a fair amount of agonizing, I dropped ""The Final Chapter"" down to a four.
Several reasons.  First of all, the fellow who plays Hitler in War and Remembrance (Steven Berkoff) does not do a good job.  He is a caricature of the evil, formidable Fuhrer.  Gunter Meisner, in ""The Winds of War"" is a far better portrayal of Hitler, and fully captures the malevolent genius of the man.  This is true of several other characters.  The chap who plays the Kommandant of the Theresienstadt concentration camp plays the role of being literally a beast in human form.  The evils of the Nazi genocidal crimes are better shown, I think, when the evildoers perpetuating these crimes are shown to be human beings knowingly committing evil--not animals who could scarcely know better.  By contrast, Gunther Halmer, who plays Rudolph Hoess, does succeed in this--this is an intelligent man who has decided, consciously, to carry out inhuman policies.  To me that is far scarier than the notion that the SS-Nazis were simply animals.  Well, that's my opinion.
""The Final Chapter"" could have used more battle action.  There was plenty of opportunity for this, what with this period covering the Normandy invasion, Patton's dash across Europe, the American victory over Japan, etc., but such is not the case here.  Lovers of this series (myself included) probably do not mind this too much, but I felt that the first chapter of ""War and Remembrance"" with its incomparable, superb depiction of the Battle of Midway, constituted better entertainment.  This is, after all, a series about World War Two.
Some of the graphic scenes of concentration camp genocide are not for children.  Parents will want to exercise judgment if youngsters are present during viewing.
These criticisms aside, ""The Final Chapter"" is quite an achievement, if for no other reason it satisfactorily wraps up the whole series reasonably smartly.  This miniseries will be an enduring classic.",1088467200,137,2241,5.032520325203252

921109,5,6304610629,"I think these movies and books are a great way to learn about WWII because the blending of historical figures/events and fictional characters makes it real and holds your interest.  You get more of a feel for what people experienced and had to deal with.  I think all three volumes (""Winds of War"" and ""War and Remembrance"") were excellent.  I bought ""Winds of War"" and received both volumes of ""War and Remembrance"" as gifts from my husband and mom.  I've read both books twice, and the movies followed the books very well.  I think this was because the author of the books, Herman Wouk, wrote the screenplays.  I also highly recommend both books.
I think the casting was great.  I think Jane Seymour and Ali MacGraw were both good as Natalie (my favorite character in the story).  Ali portrayed the spitfire part of Natalie's personality better; but, Seymour brought a depth, compassion and softness to the character that Natalie did possess.  I think Natalie should have escaped when she could've, but then the story wouldn't have been as powerful and moving as it was.  I believe Wouk had a point to make in writing the story that way.  It stressed devotion to a loved one in trouble, and the unwillingness to believe the unthinkable could happen.  Both of these were prevalent among the Jewish community in WWII.  I think Mitchum & Bergen were great--wonderful chemistry and playing off one another.  I think Sir John Gielgud was a better choice for the part of Aaron Jastrow than John Houseman.  I liked both Jan Michael-Vincent and Hart Bochner as Briny.  I think the part of Hitler in both movies could have been cast better.  David Dukes as Slote, Topol as Berel Jastrow and Sami Frey as Rabinovitz were choice--couldn't have been cast better.  Eddie Albert as Assistant Secretary of State Breckinridge Long was good.  Long was an embarrassment to the U.S. during that time--a person who should have never held that position.  (Enough of my political opinion!)  Ralph Bellamy as Roosevelt was also great.  Robert Hardy as Churchill was good.  Bill Wallis as Beck was spooky--he played the part so well.
I've used the movies as a way to teach my children about WWII and the lessons we can learn from it.  I am a WWII buff, and have read many factual books on the subject and seen many documentaries.  The works by Herman Wouk and Bodie Thoene (also excellent) are the only historical fiction books I've read on the subject.  My main interest is the history of the Holocaust, Hitler and the war in Europe.  I believe there are many lessons we as individuals and the U.S. as a nation can learn from WWII.  History always repeats itself.  I also highly recommend the book and movie ""The Hiding Place"" by Corrie ten Boom which chronicles the story of the ten Boom family in WWII Holland as they hid Jews in their home.  They were a strong Christian family who were eventually arrested and two of them were sent to Ravensbruck concentration camp.  I hope this review is helpful and happy reading and enjoy the movie!",1039219200,70,3019,4.7041984732824424

921112,5,6304610629,"I'm not a qualified movie critic but I wanted to concur with the other reviews. The quality of the casting/performances does run the gamut from lackluster to brilliant but, in my opinion, this actually enhances the experience. You don't view this movie, you experience it. It draws you into the uncertainty and the urgency of the period, the dispersal of military families, and the abject horror of war and the holocaust. You have to keep your distance from Schindler's list but you can imagine that you're a part of this great historical work. ""Winds"" and ""War"" are as good as any works to come out of Hollywood. Notice that most reviewers ""love"" it and have to relive it often. It's so real. This film becomes a part of you and you, a part of it.",988329600,13,748,4.548148148148148
921113,3,6304610629,"The story as a TV series has numerous flaws; acting casting etc. However,one cannot help but to be moved and shaken at the depiction of the death of Aaron Jastrow. For all of the nay sayers who cry that the holocaust did not happen and who harbor any Anti-Jew or Anti-Semetic ideas, and for those of us who don't, I would make those scenes required watching.

921114,5,6304610629,"War and Remembrance"" picks up where the infinitely superior ""Winds of War"" leaves off. This continuation has a multitude of problems and is not nearly as cohesive or riveting as its predecessor, but it's still worth watching and re-watching. Be prepared for a long sojourn in front of your TV however, it's 23 total hours of viewing time.
Some of the problems of its precursor have thankfully vanished... But the character of Natalie grates on the nerves. She makes one appalling choice after the other, until it's difficult to root for her. In addition, Seymour plays Natalie as a curiously flat character, and missing is the essential fire and determination of Wouk's Natalie. Hart Bochner is a marginal improvement over Vincent as the whiny Bryan, but his screen chemistry with Seymour is zilch. His scenes with Mitchum also betray his liabilities as an actor. Whereas Jan-Michael Vincent's Bryan was sympathetic and appealing, Bochner plays the part as a mean-spirited, spoiled and pompous prig: watch especially his scene with Mitchum when he whines about the picture of Pam Tudsbury on the table.
And what of the magnificent Robert Mitchum, the glue that holds the series together? He is much too old for the part of Pug Henry here and his limitations show. Whereas he was a trifle elderly for the Pug part in volume one, this was filmed six years later and Mitchum is downright doddering. Is he still sexy? You bet. Is it still believable that Pamela Tudsbury (played a bit insipidly by Victoria Tennant) would travel across the world to lie chastely in his arms for 10 minutes? Well... it's a stretch, but I wouldn't say no to Mitchum, would you?
The historical characters are, again, wretched. The Hitler they cast is absurd and one wonders how such a raving cretin as this could have held the German nation spellbound for twelve dark years. In fact, the Hitler scenes are riddled with absurd errors and if anyone believes that actual Hitler behaved like this ignorant maniac, please consult a non-fictional history. It's amusing that Pug Henry again meets all of the integral characters of WWII in one fell swoop: Hitler is on his dance card, as well as Churchill, Stalin, Mussolini and anyone else he chooses to see. It's silly, contrived and forced, but it still manages to rivet the viewer.
If you're expecting true-to-life World War II drama, forget it. But if you love Robert Mitchum, a good story of epic proportions, then this will suffice. I watch it every few years and love it despite its myriad problems.",978566400,20,2525,4.860788863109049
