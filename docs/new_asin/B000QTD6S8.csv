2840167,5,B000QTD6S8,I had watched this movie on television many years ago and didn't think it was even available.  But you know Amozon.com....they have almost everything available.,1355443200,,160,5.4
2840168,4,B000QTD6S8,Saw this on television years ago.  Glad to find it on DVD.  Touching film about personal growth and accomplishment.  Desi Arnez Jr. is very good in this as well as Mike Evans.  It is fun to watch Desi Arnez Jr's other films.  Good movie.,1330473600,2,237,4.295454545454546
2840169,5,B000QTD6S8,"""The Voyage of the Yes"" brings together two young men from basically opposite backgrounds, for an adventure that's far more than they had anticipated.  Disaster happens, and the ending is happy and poignant.",1297382400,5,207,5.2727272727272725
2840170,5,B000QTD6S8,This is a fantastic treacherous Journey Movie starring Desi Arnaz Jr. and Lionel Merchant about two teenagers from different backgrounds sailing to Hawaii. It's a must see!!!,1181001600,7,174,5.481481481481482
2840171,4,B000QTD6S8,"This movie scared the CRAP out of me when I saw it. I was only about 12, so forgive me if my movie-reviewing skills weren't up to par.

I am looking forward to watching it again, and I will update my review when I do.",1448064000,,217,3.8222222222222224
2840172,1,B000QTD6S8,"C'mon, this is this worst kind of made for TV movie financed by some rich actor kid's famous father ever made. I skipped over most of it and still couldn't finish it.",1446422400,,166,4.21875
2840173,3,B000QTD6S8,Dated.  Not much sailing.,1443139200,,25,5.25
2840174,4,B000QTD6S8,Great movie.  First saw it when I was a teen.,1442275200,,45,3.5
2840175,4,B000QTD6S8,"Awesome B movie. It's simple, made for TV movie in the 70's. I liked it. No awesome Special effects, just a simple storyline and seeing that it was BCP (Bing Crosby prdution), you know they didn't spen a lot of money on it. Another movie that rememinded me of my childhood long ago,  and brought back memories that I had thought were forgoten...",1440028800,,345,4.476190476190476
2840176,5,B000QTD6S8,I remembered parts of this movie from my youth and went looking for it to see it again. So happy I found it. Better than I remember it.,1439683200,,135,3.857142857142857
2840177,4,B000QTD6S8,Great movie but sound sucks,1433030400,,27,4.6
2840178,3,B000QTD6S8,"Full of a sort of dated innocent  corniness. BTW, where did they get the fuel to power what appeared to be a sort of 4cycle lawnmower engine?",1432944000,,141,4.222222222222222
2840179,5,B000QTD6S8,I grew up watching this movie every weekend on my parent's sailboat. I was so excited to find it on Amazon Prime.,1419811200,,113,4.181818181818182
2840180,5,B000QTD6S8,Maybe not the greatest in technology - but a GREAT MOVIE - I was not expecting this story - one I think every elementary school child should see - a taste of what real life might be - addressing problems - overcoming many different things - rising above and learning from others - erasing barriers and meeting another for who and what they are - basic lessons in life - they played very real characters and very glad I watched it - thank you,1418515200,,441,4.261904761904762
2840181,5,B000QTD6S8,"Its touching story,,its two,bad to see michael,evens died of cancer,  in real,life,",1413849600,,83,5.916666666666667
2840182,5,B000QTD6S8,Just a great movie from the 70s.,1412899200,,32,3.7142857142857144
2840183,3,B000QTD6S8,"For the year it was produced, it's interesting, the production values are pretty much 1970s, the cheesy music is pure Aaron Spelling.  That said, it is an interesting story.  Having been on a boat that far out to sea, they could have done a better job of showing what it is really like out there.  But, they told a good story, and it was a fun movie to watch.  Such a good looking kid, what is Desi up to now?",1398211200,,409,4.075
2840184,5,B000QTD6S8,"The storyline of this movie is a great one. One that still continues today about how to races learn to survive in life's adventures. Some may see it as a ""B"" movie due to its low quality and that fact that it is from the 70s. You will enjoy it.",1397347200,,244,3.9
2840185,1,B000QTD6S8,"As someone who has sailed from California to Hawaii, this ""film"" is tripe.  Consider it a 60's home movie with bad acting and bad dialog,",1396051200,3,137,4.48
2840186,4,B000QTD6S8,"I often watch a ""B"" rated film just for the sailing footage, but in this case it was often filmed on stage. Hard to make a realistic film about a storm in a bathtub.",1395100800,4,165,3.8823529411764706
2840187,1,B000QTD6S8,"This is a badly-acted, low-value vanity-pic funded by parents Lucy and Desi Arnez to try to kick start their son's non-happening-career. From the terribly off-key song at the beginning through the rest of the stock-shots of flat characters and flat plots, this is a dog, howling-at-the-moon, waste of time. Not one good idea or interesting twist in the entire reel.  Any wonder why Desi Arnez Jr. was never heard of again?",1387584000,2,422,4.943661971830986
2840188,5,B000QTD6S8,"Very nice , it should be in the big screen , I enjoyed all the way , they should make more like this one.",1386720000,,105,3.4166666666666665
2840189,5,B000QTD6S8,I saw this movie years ago and it really stuck in my mind. I was so glad when I was able to find a a copy to buy on Amazon.,1385337600,,123,3.1333333333333333
2840190,4,B000QTD6S8,Great movie for old school!! Love Desi Jr. But wish he sounded like Sr. Both main actors made u believe it was really happening .,1384387200,,129,4.2
8197311,2,B000QTD6S8,"Because of the sailing theme, I really wanted to watch this movie, which, contrary to the Amazon description, was not made in 2003 or so but rather in 1972 approximately. And, I guess because of the old age of this film the print was horrible. It was disgustingly blurry. A big ugh. After 3 minutes I closed the player. I wish Amazon would put its dough into buying recent movies which would be clear and crisp.",1524960000,,411,4.421052631578948
8197312,3,B000QTD6S8,Chose it because of sailing theme plot still applies today.,1477180800,,59,5.0
8197313,5,B000QTD6S8,"The plot and story are simple.  But that reflects real life on the ocean.  Events, conflicts and celebrations get reduced to their basic elements when your world is restricted to your boat alone.  In that sense the movie IS a sailing movie.  Of course, primarily it is about 2 seemingly different you men.  Different walks of life but having to make their first real adult decisions.  The focus on race relations was very appropriate to the times.
Of course the production values won't appeal to younger audiences and this movie never had a big budget.  But it's the story that matters and the movie does a pretty good job at presenting the story in a straight forward way without insulting intelligence.",1477180800,,704,4.768595041322314

8197316,5,B000QTD6S8,"I seen this movie a long time ago, and been waiting for it to come on tv again. But it never did so when I seen it on Amazon I order it. It's a great movie.",1467331200,,156,3.361111111111111
8197317,4,B000QTD6S8,Kept me interested. Made me wish I could do something like that.,1466208000,,64,4.416666666666667
