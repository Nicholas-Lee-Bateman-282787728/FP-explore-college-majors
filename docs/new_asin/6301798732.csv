369934,5,6301798732,"Tallulah takes On the Nazis! Not only one of the most intelligent & entertaining films ever, but a camp tour de force for ""dahling"" Tallu, who gives one of the most incredible performances in movie history. Right up there with Gloria in ""Sunset Boulevard"", & Bette in ""All About Eve"". She is DEFINATLEY the male lead in drag, despite occasional tears. She whirls through the movie with such intelligence and brilliance, in this, her only major film role. A shame, but what a record this film leaves. One feels director Alfred Hitchcock did not intend for Tallulah's role to be the ""star"" role, she was known as a brilliant but sometimes unreliable (LOVED to party) stage actress whose peak was reached in the 1920's and '30's. But, she took it and made it one, she IS the star!!  Complimented with an incredible ensamble cast, she leads to the films final line....  her close up, sweeping music!!....I DEFY you not to get goose bumps!! A PERFECT movie, written by John Steinbeck,... with one of the greatest actresses who ever lived.",984614400,,1033,4.76536312849162
369935,4,6301798732,"LIFEBOAT is a Hitchcock film I recommend.  The events that happen are somewhat thrilling if you get into the film and the characters a sympathetic and human if somewhat cliched.  It is a touching film if you are interested in this kind of thing.  This is a somewhat different subject for Alfred Hitchcock and he does superior work with such a small acting space.  Until the end, all the surroundings are of a lifeboat and in an ocean.  The acting is excellent.  Tallulah Bankhead is wonderful as the typical unattached journalist.",977184000,2,530,4.769230769230769
369936,5,6301798732,"Even though this film takes place exclusively in the single setting of a  lifeboat, it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat.  I think a  bit too much has been given away already in the previous reviews, so I'll  just say get this movie and watch it.  You won't be disappointed.  Not  Hitchcock's best, but still worth watching.",966297600,,341,4.403225806451613
369937,4,6301798732,"An ambitious film for its time, ""Lifeboat"" capably depicts the despair of a very diverse group of people shipwrecked in a tiny boat on an  immense ocean.  During a wartime encounter between a British  merchant-freighter and a German U-boat, both vessels are sunk and only nine  survivors make it into the lifeboat.  One is a German submariner.  Human  compassion prevails as he is permitted aboard -- besides, he is the only  one with any ability to navigate.  Tallulah Bankhead gives an impressive  performance as the domineering, spoiled, Society reporter who takes command  of her companions' fate.  Skilled in German, only she can communicate with  the taciturn ""prisoner"".  Suspense mounts with the suspicion that  the German is actually a Nazi officer who is directing the lifeboat into a  trap.  As the survivors are stricken with one disaster after another,  accusations erupt into violence that even the indomitable Tallulah may not  be able to control.  But through it all, her lipstick and coiffure will  remain perfect!  This fine classic film is a very intense psychological  study which ought to appeal to a new audience enfatuated with current  televised ""survival"" series.",965433600,13,1188,5.196808510638298
369938,5,6301798732,"Lifeboat where do i begin? well for starters i guess it would have to be that this is one of my all time favorite Films from Alfred Hitchcock. But to most people they have never heard of Lifeboat. Yeah it was one of his  early works but one of his best. Most people when they think of Hitchcock  they think of Psycho ans The Birds and Vertigo. But this is better than the  birds. It has a human story and ever increasing the tension. In a by gone  era of hollywood when movies were grand in spectical not budget.
Lifeboat is about a freighter that is heading to New York. But is sunk  by a German U-boat and in the opening scenes there is Tallulah Bankhead in  a lifeboat all by herself with all of her belongings. Then one by one they  pick up more survivors the tension increasing when they pick up a crewman  of the U-boat. Only Hitchcock would make his backlot movie with fake clouds  seem so real and make a the ocean look vast and barren. He also manages to  elict good performances from Bankhead,Walter Slezak, Canada Lee and  others.
I would highly reccomend that you check out this film from the  master of suspense. this is not to be missed of put of. It is very  suspensful i mean would you come to expect less from Hitchcock.
SEE THIS  MOVIE I BEG YOU.",964310400,21,1264,4.256302521008403
369939,4,6301798732,"Lifeboat isn't as famous as some of Hitchcock's other films, but it deserves to be seen today.  It's a chance to see Tallulah Bankhead, who if anything, had a very interesting screen presence.  She was an original.  It's also a chance to see a very human portrayal of an African American  character (Canada Lee) at a time when Hollywood rarely did that.  There is  also a lot of commentary about the Germans and the war, which given the  time when this film was made (during the war), makes it all the more  fascinating.  The performances are good (including a very young Hume  Cronyn), and Hitchcock manages to keep the action moving despite having so  limited a space in which to do so.  If you like Alfred Hitchcock, this is  one you should see.",947721600,17,748,4.533834586466165
369940,5,6301798732,"Tallulah Bankhead was the toast of London in the twenties where she was loved for her acting and rather risque and unpredictable ""bad-girl"" personality.  Bankhead went to Hollywood in 1931 to make films and they were not popular with the public; she then went back to the stage. ""Lifeboat"" remains her finest hour before the cameras; in this film you can get  some idea of what all the fuss was about. This is a study of nine people surviving together on a lifeboat in the middle of nowhere.  There are some amazing scenes in this claustrophobic setting and the actors milk their roles for all they're worth. Bankhead loathed Slezak and called him degrading ethnic names during the filming;Hitchcock's trademark appearance is in a newspaper ad for ""Reduco"".",944265600,,757,4.8984375

  I purchase this movie by mistake (the movie I REALLY wanted was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abandon-Ship-1957-a-k-a-Seven-Waves-Away/dp/B006NQDCAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abandon Ship (1957) [a.k.a. Seven Waves Away</a>], which I figured out AFTER I received this movie from Amazon) in November of 2013  and, because it was NOT ""Abandon Ship"", I let it sit on a shelf until very recently (because, I remembered watching ""Lifeboat"" in the early 1980s and being fairly unimpressed with it at that time).

  Boy, what a difference a few decades make  because, this movie sure has changed! (It can't possibly be ME that's changed, so it HAS to be the movie that's changed, right?) Watching this movie now, I wonder what was wrong with me then, that made me not like it at that time! This movie features several great actresses and actors giving excellent performances under the steady hand of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. It has an excellent plot, that has a laser-like focus on the foibles and natures of humans under stress  and having your ship torpedoed, and sunk, from under you, in the middle of the Atlantic ocean, and winding up, cast adrift, in a under-provisioned lifeboat, along with a crew-member of the German submarine that sank your ship, is certainly a stressful situation. (Now, that I've recently come to my senses) highly recommended.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  1.33:1  B&W  480p  MPEG-2 (8.5 Mbps)

  Within the confines of the DVD format, this film exhibits excellent picture quality  due, in part, no doubt, to a much higher than average bit-rate than is normally used for an ""old"" B&W movie. Also, it appears that Fox Home Video has done some level of restoration and re-mastering, because there are very few discernible instances of artifacts such as black specks and white dots. Nor do I recall seeing any occurrences of hair-lines or dropped frames. In addition, sharpness and detail (for a DVD) are VERY good (and, frequently excellent)  with the textures of most clothing, hair-styles and other objects being readily apparent. Lastly, contrast and gray scale (again, for a DVD) are very good overall, and in some scenes, even excellent. Overall, the picture quality of this disc is very pleasing.

AUDIO:  Dolby Digital 2.0 (Dual-Mono, 192 Kbps)

  Fox Home Video has apparently also done some clean-up work on the film's soundtrack, because there are no loud bumps nor objectionably high levels of hiss. Also, dialog is very clear and all voices are easily understood. However, dynamic range is limited, and there is not much bottom-end nor any top-end to speak of (which makes the musical score and the Foley work all sound a little 'thin' and less than realistic). Otherwise, considering the age of the source elements and the fact that this is a monophonic, dialog-driven, movie from the mid-1940s, this film's audio presentation has acceptable sound quality.

""Lifeboat"" (1944) was the seventh film in Hitchcock's Hollywood career, and the only war movie he ever directed (not to be confused with spy movies).
The 2017 Kino Lorber Blu-Ray is a reissue of the 2005 DVD from Fox Home Video.
All the bonus features from 2005 have been carried over to Blu-Ray:
-- Audio Commentary by Drew Casper
-- The Making of ""Lifeboat"" (20 minutes)
-- Still Photos
Plus new Blu-Ray bonus features for 2017:
-- A second Audio Commentary by Tim Lucas
(Drew Casper called it ""re-duck-o"". Tim Lucas calls it ""re-deuce-o"", which seems more logical.)
-- Hitchcock/Truffaut audio interview (with the still photos from 2005)
The only losses from the old DVD:
-- The Blu-Ray has the original mono soundtrack; the DVD also had a (fake) stereo soundtrack.
-- The Blu-Ray has English SDH subtitles; the DVD also had Spanish subtitles.
The new Blu-Ray transfer is an improvement over the old DVD.
Not dramatic, but noticeable.

POINTS OF INTEREST:
-- Surprisingly for an action film, top-billing went to the actress Tallulah Bankhead (photo 3).
The 42 year-old Bankhead had not made a Hollywood film since 1932's ""Faithless"" (aside from a cameo in 1943's ""Stage Door Canteen""), preferring the Broadway stage.
Top-billing her after a twelve year absence from Hollywood was a daring move, but it paid off in a bravura performance.
She was cast in the film because Alfred Hitchcock wanted to use ""the most oblique, incongruous person imaginable in such a situation"".
-- During filming, several crew members noted that Miss Bankhead was not wearing underwear.
When advised of this situation, Alfred Hitchcock observed, ""I don't know if this is a matter for the costume department, makeup, or hairdressing."" (Source: IMDB)
-- Only nine principal actors were used.
Filmed entirely in an enormous water tank on the Fox lot.
Actor Murray Alper (photo 4) had to withdraw from the film due to severe seasickness.
Replaced by William Bendix.
-- The confined set would seem to rule out the director's's traditional cameo appearance,
but Hitchcock came up with a novel solution:
@ 25:15 into the film, he appears in ""before"" and ""after"" pictures in a newspaper advertisement for ""Reduco, the Obesity Slayer"" (photos 1-2)

ALFRED HITCHCOCK FILMOGRAPHY:
Alfred Hitchcock directed 56 feature films (one is lost) over a 51 year period.
To date, 32 Hitchcock films have been released on Blu-Ray.

PART ONE: BRITISH PERIOD
Alfred Hitchcock directed 26 feature-length films for British studios between 1925 and 1939.
The first ten were silent.
""The Mountain Eagle"" (1927) is a lost film.
""Blackmail"" (1929) is counted twice - it was Hitchcock's final silent film, and simultaneously filmed as his first talkie.
To date, the Criterion Collection has released five of the British films on Blu-Ray.
I hope more will follow, but have no inside information.
All but two of the remaining films are on DVD. The exceptions:
-- ""Blackmail"", the silent version (1929)
-- ""Mary"" (1931),  the German language version of ""Murder!""
These obscure titles seem to cry out for the deluxe treatment in a double bill with the readily available version of the same film, but so far no company has risen to the bait (Criterion? Kino? anybody?)

Tragically, the elements to this movie have not aged well at all. Fox might have attempted a more costly clean-up and restoration, working with what they have, but instead we get the same DVD transfer bumped to a 1080p signal; riddled in age-related dirt, scratches, water and mold damage with boosted contrast and some digital anomalies amplified by Blu-ray's higher resolution. While the results are still 'watchable' they diminish the strength of performances put forth by this all-star killer cast. Tallulah Bankhead, the wily Southerner, is the star of this show, but gets ample support from all concerned; especially, John Hodiak, Walter Slezak and Hume Cronyn. Great film. Crappy transfer.

370041,5,6301798732,"A lot of fuss was made when Lifeboat was released in 1944, not the least of which were the unwarranted accusations that the film was pro-German while denigrating the Americans and the Brits.  Not wanting to go down with this ship, Steinbeck tried to publicly dissociate himself from the film, denouncing Hitchcock and demanding that his name not be used to promote the project.  Hitchcock maintained that the moral of the story was that the Allies needed to stop bickering and work together to win the war.  Tullulah Bankhead reaffirmed that assessment, adding that it was an important lesson, you cant trust the enemy!

Lifeboat was nominated for only three Oscars, winning none (Best Director Hitchcock, Best Story Steinbeck, and Best Black & White Cinematography Glen MacWilliams).

This is an incredible achievement, especially considering it was shot in a studio, where all of the action is confined to a boat with just a few characters involved.  Definitely one of Hitchcocks better films.",1489536000,,995,5.111111111111111

370116,5,6301798732,"Hitchcock had always wanted to shoot a film in a confined space, and Lifeboat was his first crack at it, followed later by Rope (1948) and Rear Window (1954). Lifeboat (1944) is predominantly a character study with bits of suspense thrown in. A freighter ship sinks somewhere in the North Atlantic. The German U-boat that sinks it also sinks. And floating not too far away is a lifeboat in which glamorous, blas journalist Constance Porter (Tallulah Bankhead) lounges as if she were chillin' in the drawing room. Soon after, eight more survivors clamber or scurry on board, the last one on instantly voted most unpopular, seeing as how he's a crewman of that doomed U-boat. Off they go, setting sail for the friendly waters of Bermuda, British Territory. Or are they?

It's a motley roster of folks from all walks of life that ends up huddling together: The fancy-pants writer; the salty ship's stoker (William Bendix); the engineman (John Hodiak) with the strong opinions; the well-heeled industrialist (Henry Hull); the pretty Army nurse (Alice MacKenzie); a gentle steward with the shady past (Canada Lee); the despondent woman (Heather Angel); the English radio operator (Hume Cronyn); and the Jerry (Walter Slezak). Hitchcock adeptly mixes and matches and plays off this character against that character, and, yeah, sh-- gets stirred up. It's a volatile group dynamic - and just maybe nine is too ambitious a number for that lifeboat.

The acting is across-the-board terrific. And yet Tallulah Bankhead's biting, brittle performance kicks everyone else's performance to the curb. Watch, as the story progresses, as the internal squabbling escalates, as conditions worsen, how her surface armor - composed of equal parts glamour and condescension and sly putdowns and throwaway flourishes such as her constant dabbing on of lipstick - steadily erodes until what's left is a wrecked woman swept up in hysteria and just as terrified and distraught and as base as everyone else.

Walter Slezak as the German passenger also stands out from the pack. Lifeboat's premiere screening sparked considerable hubbub in that theater audiences and critics were upset that Slezak's character, Willi, was portrayed as so capable, in fact, more capable and more resourceful than the American and Breton passengers. I mean, the guy performs a tricky mid-sea amputation, for cripes' sake! There were even moments in which Willi came off as sympathetic. Chalk it up to good writing and the smart realization that it's a richer payoff were the big bad limned with dimension and with nuance.

Working off a John Steinbeck story (which, in turn, was based on an idea of Hitchcock's), Lifeboat garnered Hitch his second Best Director Oscar nomination (after Rebecca), and, certainly, his direction here is masterful. One of his brilliant notions was to do away with a musical score apart from the orchestra playing over the title credits. This absence of score served to heighten that sense of desolation, the actors AND the viewing audience left exposed to the primal and sometimes numbing sounds of waves lapping and the winds howling and the rain come pouring down. This adds a near dreamlike quality to the story. Oh, and if you were wondering how in heck would Hitch insert himself for his traditional cameo, given that it's such a limited, confined cast and space, well, he pulls it off cleverly. In fact, his weight loss advert - ""Reduco, Obesity Slayer"" - in the newspaper being read by one of the characters had all sorts of folks clamoring for the nonexistent product, just one more bit of manipulation done by the Master of Suspense.

My favorite putdown by Constance? It's when she tells off Kovac, that super-intense engine room guy: ""That goes for you, too, narcissist."" Trust me, as delivered by Tallulah Bankhead, no other combination of words came off more scathing.",1467417600,,3863,5.077165354330709

370120,4,6301798732,"""Lifeboat"" should not be ignored any longer. In fact, Alfred Hitchcock's film catalog especially his early black and white silent films explore his genius. ""Lifeboat"" stars an all-star cast like Tallulah Bankhead, Canada Lee, Hume Cronyn, William Bendix, Walter Slezak, Heather Angel, Mary Angerson, and John Hodiak playing survivors on a lifeboat in the Atlantic Ocean. They had survived a torpedo striking their ship. The film begins with Tallulah Bankhead playing Constance Porter, a wealthy journalist and socialite, who survives with her luggage in a lifeboat. She helps rescue a handsome male survivor and they rescue others. The chemistry is obvious in the beginning.

Tallulah Bankhead was one of America's best known theatrical actresses but her reputation of difficult perhaps dampened her film career. She made a few films during her career. Despite a small collection of film performances, Tallulah earned a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for film. This film is perhaps her best known performance in this medium.

The film last over 90 minutes but it is filled with action and danger especially among the survivors. They are struggling to survive on a lifeboat with little provisions like food and water. One of their characters must endure an amputation; a loss; and their mistrust of each other. The world is at war and the Nazis had killed the others aboard their ship.

Tallulah steals the show and thunder from her female costars. Hume Cronyn and Canada Lee are terrific as other survivors. William Bendix is also terrific in his role as Gus Smith. Walter Slezak is also among the survivors as German Nazi who the other survivors mistrust immediately. The cast is first rate and the writing is done well too. John Steinbeck and Alfred Hitchcock's collaboration in this film delivers a first rate rare glimpse of life with bare essentials.

If you love Alfred Hitchcock's films, you will certainly enjoy ""Lifeboat"" as among his finest of the best. Too bad, Tallulah never made more films with Hitchcock. She could recite a phone book and make it sound sexual. Her performance steals the film from her co-stars too.

The DVD also features ""The Making of Lifeboat"" special feature with Alfred Hitchcock's daughter and granddaughter and a professor from University of California detailing the film's history. The film captures life at a difficult time in world history. The film questions survival and trust among the survivors. What would you do to survive in the middle of nowhere? The film makes you question it.",1464825600,,2532,5.076923076923077

This film may be uninteresting by today's standards.  It is hard for me to relate to that, in that I think it is such a great work of art.

It was filmed during World War II.  I think people then had a sense of a war that was truly good verses evil. Young Americans were making the ultimate sacrifice every day.  There was an all out ""Battle of The Atlantic"" being fought to the last bitter inch.  That was the zeitgeist of the period.

Then there is the way the film is shot.  The director is Albert Hitchcock, one of the greatest directors ever.  A very limited cast, all living with each other in a life boat.  The entire movie is shot within the life boat.  A German sailor also survives the battle and is also in the life boat.

I suppose this does not pass the test for ""light entertainment"" today.  But for a student of movie history and the art of film making, I think this is a ""must see"".",1452211200,,1065,4.207920792079208

This isn't a scary movie, or a horror movie, as are several of Alfred Hitchcock's movies.

""Lifeboat"" is suspenseful though, as you don't know what will happen next. The  story and general themes of this film are based in real life experiences of ""lifeboat survivors,"" most especially those of early WW2.

The Germans sank many cargo ships during the ""Battle of the Atlantic."" What most people don't know, is that most cargo ships, historically and even today, had ""guest cabins"" that would accommodate paying passengers, some ships had many. Paying passengers added profit to each trip. During the ""Battle of the Atlantic"" passage in such a cabin brought a lot of risk, because of German attacks.

My favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies:
1 Foreign Correspondent (1940) Joel McCrea, Laraine Day, George Sanders (Notice the amazing use of 'light' in this film.)
2 Lifeboat (1944) (Many top stars, super movie entertainment.)
3 Saboteur (1942) Bob Cummings, Priscilla Lane (Glendale, CA - Boulder Dam - Rockefeller Center - Statue of Liberty; Wow!)
4 The Trouble with Harry (1955) (A wonderful, quirky, dark & intriguingly romantic comedy, with a very young Shirley MacLaine)
5 To Catch a Thief (1955) Cary Grant, Grace Kelly (Wonderful 'cat burglar' romance & thrills on the French Rivera)
6 North by Northwest (1959) Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint (They have the wrong man, but they won't believe it.)
7 The Birds (1963) (Amazing story! Tippi Hedren is gorgeous! And how'd they get those birds to do that in 1963?)
8 The Wrong Man (1956) Henry Fonda (Wow, what this guy goes through. The legal system isn't much better today.)
9 Notorious (1946) Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman (Can he rescue her, get out of so much trouble, she & the bad guy; How is this going to end?)

Others I like:
The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) Jimmy Stewart, Doris Day (What a terrible vacation.)
The Paradine Case (1947) Gregory Peck (Did Anna poison her rich older husband? Or was it the butler?)
Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941) Carole Lombard, Robert Montgomery (A screwball romantic comedy.)
Torn Curtain (1966) Paul Newman, Julie Andrews (Keep in mind how extreme things were after the ""Iron Curtain"" fell.)

Other Hitchcock Movies that I Hate! (Sorry):
Psycho Yuck!
Strangers on a Train
Vertigo
Marnie
Frenzy

I'd also recommend:
Witness for the Prosecution (1957) by Billy Wilder. (This Hitchcock 'like' film is intriguing, suspenseful, full of twists and irony.)

370290,4,6301798732,"Written by John Steinbeck, ""Lifeboat""  is essentially about the American dilemma regarding international conflict--when everyone in the country comes from someplace else, what happens when we are at war with a nation whose immigrants have lived here for generations? And even more fundamentally, is our human need to trust each other simply a naive artifact of religions and constitutions that have no place in a world that can manufacture global war, global destruction, or is it indelible and worth preserving? What is more noble--to act as if another person will not harm you and treat him as you would treat yourself, or to be prepared first to fight, garnering all defenses, even if they are deceptive, selfish actions?

The New York Times review published in 1944 questioned whether this movie was appropriate to show the American public in the midst of a world war and Steinbeck asked for his name off the credits. But watching it in 2015, perhaps more sensitively primed to ethical nuance after seven decades that included Watergate, the civil rights movement, the Bush era and traveling almost ten years now through the worlds of great writers like JJ Abrams and Christopher Nolan via all the superhero movies, and apocalyptic nightmares spawned from Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road""--I say, bring it on. Let's examine it, let's get down to the nitty-gritty. Steinbeck and Hitchcock were brave enough to do it then and for that reason alone, to witness two men putting their beliefs on the line way before it was fashionable or understood, you should watch it.

On a lighter note, Tallulah Bankhead's character in that aforementioned NY Times review is solely referred to as a ""parasite"", or ""parasitic""--the fact that she plays a journalist is clear to the modern viewer and that description, if it was written now, would strike us as wildly off-base and bizarre: ladies, in this regard, we truly have come a long way. ""Lifeboat"" is generally considered her greatest role and she certainly gets the Great Speech. But my favorite quote of hers comes from real life: after running into an ex-lover she was purported to say, ""I thought I told you to wait in the car."" I doubt even Steinbeck could've matched that line.",1433030400,2,2221,4.96505376344086

370375,5,6301798732,"This is an enjoyable Hitchcock movie from 1944. The acting is superb. It was fun to see a very young Hume Cronyn, whom I remember from Cocoon, as well as to discover that Talulah Bankhead was a first-rate actress.

The setting is, of course, exclusively on a lifeboat drifting in the Atlantic after the sinking of the survivor's ship by a German U-boat during World War II.  The survivors are a diverse group that includes representatives of various social classes, races, ethnicities, and nationalities, and, so, to that extent, may represent the Allied effort during the war.

The survivors rescue a German sailor, who turns out to be the Nazi captain of the U-boat.  The captain eventually takes over the lifeboat because of his ""Nazi superiority,"" but reveals a Nazi psychopathy to the weak and disabled. It is up to the diverse and relatively weak passengers to band together and turn things around, which may be another planted theme from the real world that was facing down a triumphant German Reich at the time this movie was made.

As a student of history, I found that this bit of preserved weltanschauung about American attitudes toward Nazis and the Germans to be fascinating and instructive.

The story was good and kept my attention. The characters were sympathetic. And, again, the actors were first-rate. It was fun to see names that I had heard of but never seen previously.

For a newcomer to the screen, he made a big impact in this film but Hollywood wasted him.  His acting was more modern, post-war style than many of the other big male screen stars of the time, like Gable and Cooper, etc.  Hitchcock builds the tension and sprinkles in humor even.

370697,5,6301798732,"This 1944 film is an interesting and unusual work of war time propaganda, but definitely better than most of such productions. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Somewhere in the North Atlantic, during the World War II, an allied armed cargo ship and an U-Boat meet and fight - and they both go down. This fight is actualy NOT shown. The film begins after the fight is over and the whole action takes place on a lifeboat on which gathered the few survivors from the cargo ship - and the only survivor from the U-Boat, a certain Willy (Walter Slezak, an actor of Austrian origin).

This being a Hitchcock film, it was clear that it was going to be a good one - but it was made even better by the scenario wrote by John Steinbeck in person...

I will not say much more about the story, because you really deserve to discover it by yourself. I will also not say much about the characters, to avoid spoilers - let's just say that the people on the lifeboat, as they were gathered there by accident and pure luck, are a very diverse bunch.

Actors did very well, even if they are today almost all forgotten. Special mentions go to the most known of them, Tallulah Bankhead and William Bendix. She plays here Connie Porter, a very liberated, aging female journalist - he plays Gus Smith, a badly wounded sailor.

I cannot resist so I must repeat here something that I found in the trivias about this film. Tallulah Bankhead had to climb a ladder every day to reach the tank where the filming took place - and as she never wore underwear she regularly received an ovation from the film crew... When advised of this underwear situation, Alfred Hitchcock answered dryly ""What do you want me to do? I don't even know if this is a matter for the costume department, makeup, or hairdressing.""...)))

Even if all the scenes were filmed in a studio, Hitchcock insisted on realism and regularly sprayed all the cast with cold salt water - for some scenes it was mixed with some black oil... As result most of the cast went down with pneumonia before the filming was over - luckily, nobody died of it...

The realism of the film is also strengthened by the very useful reminder that, at least in the first three and a half years of the war, German U-Boats and surface raiders in the Atlantic were also efficiently assisted by supply ships, which could make cruises as long as a year, avoiding detection by allies...

I am going to end this review here to avoid any more spoilers, but I will just say this here - this is a Hitchcock film, so be ready for anythign and everything. Me, I was surprised and shocked by the ending - so brace yourself...

This is a very good, unusual, original and surprising little known film. ENJOY!",1412726400,,2737,4.490945674044266

371009,5,6301798732,"What else can I say about this wonderful, long forgotten 1944 classic? It's a gripping story well told, all the more impressive for being shot on the single set of the lifeboat--which was both brilliantly cost-effective and brilliantly brave.

Other reviewers feel the script is soft on Nazism for 1944, when the British and the Allies could still easily have lost the war to Hitler, and I agree.
Slezak's Nazi U-boat Captain makes complete fools of our cast from beginning to end, and beyond the sinking of their civilian ship and the deaths of all the others aboard, we watch him deliberately plot and execute the coldblooded murders of two of the most vulnerable innocents aboard the lifeboat--three, if you include the baby.

The script and plot requires the traumatized survivors to hesitate and dither about 'humanitarianism' long after I know I would have beaten him to a pulp and thrown the corpse overboard-- and I'm sure that 1944 audiences, with bombs falling and London in ruins and loved ones in uniform fighting and dying to stop Hitler and Naziism, felt even more strongly.

In the end even our indecisive, long-suffering lifeboat survivors finally unite and do just that-- beating the evil Der Kapitan to death and dropping his body overboard-- but far too late, and after innocent lives have been lost by their 'humanitarian compassion' in the face of the Nazi's evil.
And the ending, especially for 1944, is too irresolute and ambiguous to be satisfying, either emotionally or intellectually. Those are flaws of the script, but also of Hitchcock's directing-- and so it's taken a long time for this flawed tour de force to receive the attention it deserves.

This is an endlessly re-watchable film. The copy quality is imperfect, sure, but this is a 70 year old film, so let's not nit-pick. Whatever flaws and signs of Time are visible don't detract, and may actually add, to the experience.

Hope this was helpful. Happy viewing, everyone.",1407542400,,1958,4.939209726443769

371090,5,6301798732,"When you think of Alfred Hitchcock, you think of murder, mystery, mayhem and cross-dressing serial killers.  Lets just be honest here.  When you think of Hitchcock and his movies you think of the obvious horror classics that he is famous for, but there are a string of really successful dramas Hitchcock directed in the 40s and 50s that deserve more consideration and attention.  In fact, I find some of his less renowned fare to be his best work, period.

Notorious, Rope, The Man Who Knew too Much and this brilliant film, Lifeboat.

Lifeboat centers on a group of relative strangers who are stranded on a lifeboat after the ship they were traveling on was attacked by the Germans and sunk.  There are eight of them, but soon they are joined by a ninth, a German soldier who isn't trusted by all but gains the trust of a few.  He throws a wrench in their unit and they soon start to disagree and bicker, and when one of their members begins to get terminally ill, their reliance on their enemy becomes a questionable affair.

The greatest thing about Lifeboat is that it manages to truly knick away at all of these human beings, finding their faults and illuminating their decisions in a light that allows us, the audience, to fully grasp the seriousness of their destitution.  The fear, the will to survive, the need to love, the wanton desire to trust; all of it comes together on the screen in a marvelous array of scenes designed to keep us glued.  Despite taking place entirely on a small boat, there is such movement here, such breath.  You can feel the expanse in every scene thanks to Hitchcocks focused direction.  The performances are also uniformly spectacular, with Tallulah Bankhead delivering an Oscar caliber performance as Connie, a journalist detached from humanity and consumed in herself only to have the ordeal at sea set her eyes straight on reality.  William Bendix, as the wounded Gus, and Walter Slezak, as the German soldier, are also VERY good here.

This is not what you may think of when you hear the name Hitchcock, but this is yet further proof that Hitchcock was one of the greatest film directors of his or any generation.  He understood humans so well that he was able to extract tension and fear out of the most humane of surroundings.  He didn't need a murder (although a few take place) and he didn't need a mystery to find his niche.  He continued to expand his own horizons and create memorable experiences time and again.",1390521600,,2462,4.662037037037037

371303,4,6301798732,"I tend to view Lifeboat as a brilliant tactical success but a strategic stalemate. From the standpoint of craft, it's near perfect, especially given its time. The opening title shot then continues as the first of the film itself, and as the camera pulls back the sight of that smokestack in its real context is pure wonder. However, making a film where all the action takes place in a lifeboat would pose problems in the 40s, and at times the use of rear projection techniques make for scenes that are too obviously fake -- still, one adjusts for the time and accepts that limitation. The script, based on a novella by John Steinbeck, does an excellent job in introducing the characters and starting them down the road to textured and engaging if sometimes cliched interactions. The actors are all well cast: John Hodiak actually appears to be made of more than wood in this picture, no mean feat for him. Canada Lee is underused, sadly, but his presence does allow the film to make a couple quiet comments on racism, observations which are rather ahead of their time for 1944. Hume Cronyn is an inconsistent English sailor, his accent fading in and out and never really sounding quite right, but he's nonetheless excellent as Sparks. Walter Slezak as the German Willi comes close to stealing the picture. I said at the beginning that I find this film does not succeed in a strategic sense, and by that I mean that at the end I'm not quite sure what if any lessons are learned, by us or the lifeboat survivors, and it's that uncertainty that leaves me without a full sense of satisfaction. And after all that dialogue aboard the lifeboat, which for me doesn't drag at all, the ending is full of action, to say the least. Some may find the movie tedious and overlaid with a bit too much of a political subtext, but those are not my reactions as well. I'm not sure where this voyage is supposed to end, but I found the ride itself engaging and then some. Recommended.",1362614400,2,1965,4.569405099150142

It has one of my favorite plots, one man, or small group, in an impossible situation. ""Lifeboat"" starts and ends in a small wooden lifeboat containing the only survivors of a ship sunk by a German U-Boat in W.W.II. But, Hitchcock adds a maguffin and the story unfolds. It has parallels to a horror story: isolation, inevitability, darkness (half the time), the uncanny (in this case it's the all-powerful, all-pervasive sea, and whatever lays beneath). The film is in B&W and except for the beginning and end has no sound score. It's seventy years young and IMHO eternal.",1356048000,,679,4.964912280701754

The plot surrounds survivors of a U-boat attack on their passenger boat that leaves them floating on the ocean with little food and water. Then, they pick up a Nazi U-Boat survivor in the water whose boat attacked them, but was also sunk by an American destroyer.

  Half of the passengers want to throw the Nazi overboard, but the other half don't. As the story progresses with a storm approaching and one of the passengers needing an amputation because of his wounds, tension builds between the passengers and the Nazi. Before long, the passengers voluntarily relinquish the control of the boat to the leadership of the Nazi whe seems to know the direction to row to get help in Bermuda. In reality, the Nazi is rowing the boat to one of the Nazi supply ships taking him to safety, and taking them to captivity, but where they can finally get much needed food and water of which they ran out.

Without revealing the exciting end, the passengers all realize that some people do not deserve mercy or cannot be trusted. Like today, kindness to your enemy and pacifism will not be rewarded, and will only get you into more trouble.",1347494400,,1436,5.34070796460177
371404,5,6301798732,"Alfred Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT is a delicious slice-of-life that age has not turned moldy.  It's as fresh a meal as the day it was made, that is, at the outbreak of WWll.  It has stars and other actors no one remembers today, but who were big in their day:  Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Walter Slezak, John Hodiak, Hume Cronyn, and all of them are crowded into a lifeboat when their ship is torpedoed by a German submarine.  The most amazing thing about LIFEBOAT is that Hitchcock keeps the viewer glued to that little boat and those intriguing characters for a full 90 minutes.  There are no cheating cutaways to relieve our eyes.  And the actors are so good that we don't want to turn away.

I can't say much about the players themselves without giving too much away, but believe me, LIFEBOAT is alive with with people who, stranded or not, can't help playing out their strengths, weaknesses, and ambivalences on each other while inveigling us into that LIFEBOAT to enjoy the cruise.  Being Hitchcock, of course, LIFEBOAT is a tale of suspense, and the plot is as loaded to the gunwales with it as is the LIFEBOAT itself.

I found LIFEBOAT on DVD at AMAZON.COM, and I truly hope you will as well.  Being Amazon, it's reasonably priced, and soon delivered.  Enjoy, enjoy!  LIFEBOAT is one the greatest - if not the greatest - movies Hitchcock ever made!

371441,5,6301798732,"For a description of the plot, read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this classic Hitchcock movie...

Lifeboat (1944) is an example of what Alfred Hitchcock could do in a very small, confined space.  Think of movies like Rear Window (1954), Rope (1948), and Dial M For Murder (1954).  All of these movies pretty much take place in one small setting.  Hitchcock knew how to get the most out of the minimum.  I think this movie is very well casted.  Tallulah Bankhead carries this movie on her shoulders.  She's great in this.  The rest of the cast is great as well, but Tallulah stands out.  Her good looks, sinister laugh, and unique voice keep viewers mesmerized in anything she's in.  Bankhead was a lifelong baseball fan, and at one point there is a conversation in the lifeboat about baseball, but ironically Bankhead isn't involved in the conversation.  This movie features two alum from the 1960s Batman TV series on ABC - Tallulah Bankhead (The Black Widow) and Walter Slezak (The Clock King).

The movie was filmed in black and white.  The first ten minutes or so of the movie have lesser picture quality than the rest of the movie due to water damage to the film.  The special effects are decent for the time period. Even with the movie taking place in a lifeboat, the movie has classic Hitchcock suspense.  The DVD contains some extras, such as a 19-minute documentary on the making of the movie, audio commentary, etc.

Overall, this is a classic Hitchcock movie that is very different from anything he ever did before and after.  I highly recommend it.",1310947200,10,1569,4.705882352941177
371442,5,6301798732,"This is a very interesting movie, the actors are great. What is there not to say about a Hitchcock movie, except excellent.",1302566400,,123,4.636363636363637
371443,4,6301798732,"Hitchcock did no favours for Tallulah Bankhead by giving ""Lifeboat"" one of the least appealing titles of all of his films (alternatively, think of the built-in audience appeal for such words as ""Notorious"" or ""Spellbound"" or ""Psycho"").
But don't be fooled. This film, and Tallulah Bankhead's performance in it, packs a whallop.

""Lifeboat"" offers no simple treatment of Hitchcock's beloved theme ""the evil that lives among us"" (explored most brilliantly in ""Shadow of a Doubt""). Instead, it offers his most unflinching, direct look at evil's social agenda. The film presents a variety of ordinary Joes and Janes (think Capra meets Hitchcock in this regard) each with their own inexperienced take on what to do. There are no predictable solutions (such as an end to evil by the death of an antagonist), nor is evil even easily recognizable.

""Lifeboat"" progresses ominously from a simple scenario of the survival of the individual to a multi-faceted revelation of the threatened survival of society itself. Clever of Hitchcock indeed, but it is Tallullah that keeps your eyes glued to the screen, waiting for her next sharply insightful comment.

Unlike Katherine Hepburn, Tallulah never overplays her cards, and she carries this film effortlessly.  She may gradually be stripped of all the fine things she treasures (Hitchcock always strives to make his protagonists vulnerable), but Tallulah never loses her core values.

At the end, it is Tallulah's embodiment of the spirit of survival that the audience identifies with, and makes ""Lifeboat"" a complex and satisfying mature movie experience.",1301443200,4,1594,5.309523809523809
371444,4,6301798732,"Despite Hollywood studio politics of the time, his own personal tragedies as the Nazis bombed England, his home, and a famous author whose short story Lifeboat is based (Steinbeck would later spurn the film as not true to his own tale), Hitchcock created a film that pioneered the film-making concepts of close-ups, quick-cuts and the entire film done on one set -- a lifeboat! -- with what we take for granted in today's small screen TV's.  And this was 1944!

Hitchcock wanted to make a statement about the war -- World War II, which was affecting his own family and interests in England -- and communicate the want, the horror and what's important and what is not -- through allegory and implication.

This special edition DVD supplies all the details of the above through the ""making of"" section -- Tallulah Bankhead's temper tantrums and prima donna activities on and off the set, Steinbeck's anger at the script that Jo Swerling wrote, and dealing with the producers who seemed to care more for profit and public relations.

The story itself is a simple one, but must be watched again and again to get all of what's going on.  War correspondent woman (Bankhead) is smarmy, stuck-up, pompous and yet has an epiphany of what is important and what is not.  Another, a rich industrialist, wants to be democratic when the Nazi comes aboard the lifeboat (a crewman of the very U-Boat that torpedoed the Americans) and who later changes his mind in a most awful manner regarding the Nazi's life and death.

Life and death.  Great themes to the Master of Suspense (initial caps!) -- even though this film lacks suspense (!) it does evoke more character development and interpersonal conflict to almost forget a war is going on -- almost!

Walter Slezak is almost cherubic and sympathetic a character yet does things behind the crew's back and eventually goes so far as to betray the lot -- but is extremely surprised at the animal reaction of the crew.

Hitchcock even figured out a way of making himself appear in this film without being part of the crew!  Clever!

Special edition recommended!

Lifeboat: Received Academy Award nominations for Best Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Screenplay.

371478,4,6301798732,"While reading the newly published screenplay Zapata by John Steinbeck, I became interested in reading about his struggle with Alfred Hitchcock over the screenplay for Lifeboat.  It seems that Hitchcock had ideas of his own that he wished to pull from the script and therefore after the screenplay was completed by Steinbeck, Hitchcock re-wrote certain passages to allow his own vision of the work to emerge. Watching this excellent film, I kept wondering which elements could be attributed to Steinbeck and which elements to Hitchcock. However, the final product is excellent and highly entertaining.
The story revolves around a lifeboat that has a group of survivors from a sea battle in the Atlantic during World War II. The German U-boat that sinks the passenger liner is also sunk. Steinbeck no doubt wished to make the survivors in the lifeboat into a microcosm of social types, but he also wished to make a commentary of the attitudes and beliefs present during the second World War. The initial survivor is a war correspondent, played by Tallulah Bankhead, but other survivors are soon fished out of the cold ocean. Also included is a millionaire industrialist, a highly literate sailor, a young female nurse running from the affair she had with a married man, a deranged mother and dead baby, a steward with a past as a pick-pocket, and several other interesting characters. The mystery, suspense, and plot revolve however not so much on when they will be rescued but around the captain of the German U-boat who is also one of the survivors. This highly skilled and intelligent sea captain is full of surprises and the reactions of the other folks in the lifeboat reflect the various responses to the rise of Nazism. Filmed in black and white, the dramatic action and confrontations never end with some surprisingly strong dialogue for an early film. Hitchcock and Steinbeck created a compelling story, presented with all the nerve tingling skills of a master film-maker.",1266192000,3,1979,5.015197568389058

Not only did the Director manage to pull off a non-ending sequences of unique shots on a small, open boat, but he able to do so while dealing with Bankhead's  distain for under garments plus insert a cameo of himself (as gradually became his ""trademark"" starting  in the mid 1920's).

In-camera effects are awesome for the time.  Front and rear projection is so seamless  and free of artifacts that it's difficult to believe the entire film was shot on sound stages.  Even though soundstage bound, it's was still no picnic for the performers (Bankhead came down with phenomena during the production--twice).

Highly recommended.  One of Hitchcock's best still waiting to be ""rediscovered.""

371484,4,6301798732,"Sometimes greatness can be achieved in a singular way, even if the totality of a work of art is not great. This came to me upon watching one of my dad's all time favorite films, and one which I have watched several dozen times in my life- Alfred Hitchcock's 1944 black and white Lifeboat, which is also one of the three or four best films Hitchcock ever made, and did receive Academy Award nominations for Best Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Screenplay. While I am not a rabid devotee of Hitchcock, because most of his thrillers are filled with rather cardboard cutout characters, despite the films' technical excellence, this is still probably my favorite Hitchcock film; not only because of the memories of watching it with my dad, but because it is one of the least Hitchcockian films in his canon- in terms of its relative lack of formulaic suspense, and because of the great and inimitable Tallulah Bankhead (one of my dad's favorite actresses), who utterly dominates every scene of the film she's in.
  The film's greatness comes in the way it realistically sketches human reactions and nature in extremis, even as it relies on some of the grossest human caricatures, stereotypes, and is a blatant bit of agitprop. That said, and given the limitations of having the film set totally in a boat, that Hitchcock comes even within spitting distance of the film being a great work of art (it's not; it misses by a hair, for the flaws mentioned) is, itself, evidence of greatness at work. It is also one of the most brilliant and odd character studies on film.
  The very schizophrenic screenplay, which alternately depicts real human emotions in characters blatantly constructed to teach a didactic lesson, and be props to push the tale forward (i.e.- how convenient it is to have both a doctor and a nurse in the same boat when another character's leg needs to be amputated; among many), and then reduces them to utter stereotypes, was adapted from an original novella, of the same title, that Hitchcock commissioned John Steinbeck to write. When Steinbeck was done, and went off to the Second World War, Hitchcock hired playwright Jo Swerling to punch up the dialogue.... For Hitchcock fans, wondering how the director snuck in his cameo, it's when Gus is reading a newspaper, and we see an ad for a diet pill- Reduco, which features before and after pictures of Hitchcock. That same gag was reused in Rope. If Lifeboat is not a great film, it's damned close, and given all the technical and script problems it had to overcome, that's a hell of an achievement, for, unlike many Hitchcock films, this one can be seen over and again and force deeper conversation each time, because it is not dependent upon a simple-minded twist ending. Thus, despite all its failings, Lifeboat is a true work of art, something its heroine has also been called. Viva recapitulation!",1221350400,5,2885,4.822222222222222

But my difficulty and problems lie mostly with my confusion about what I was supposed to feel.  The message is not clear.  I find this troubling since Hitchcock, being the master, was always able to control his audience without them ever knowing (remember during Psycho, when suddenly the car NOT going into the lake scared you, and you may have noticed later that your allegiance shifted, without a conscious decision, from Marion to Norman?).

Regardless of that, Tallulah Bankhead was marvelous, as was Canada Lee (even in his confined role of George ""Joe"" Spencer).

Hitchcock's movie gave me a better idea of how small such a boat would be---and there are only _8_ people in Hitchcock's lifeboat, not 36!---and it was intriguing to watch the survivors become a community, judging by concensus what was acceptable behavior and what was not, with the stronger personalities leading and the others following.

The basic premise, a group of disparate strangers is stranded on a lifeboast after their ship is torpedoed by a Nazi sub, is deceptively simple.  Through some clever plotting and typical Hitchcock ingenuity behind the camera, a tense tale unfolds which confounds expectations by offering up some real suspense and more than a few surprises.  I won't spoil the specifics for those who haven't seen it yet, but suffice it to say that not all is as it seems aboard the seemingly doomed vessel.  And if 96 minutes of nine people on a boat seems boring, there are a handful of visually shocking scenes that stave off any complacency the viewer might feel.

In addition to the film, there are a couple of bonus features of special interest to fans of Hithcock.  A brief featurette offers insight into the film's production.  As with previous Hitch DVD releases, his daughter Pat offers first-hand accounts of the film's production.  Hitchcock scholar and professor Drew Casper offers an expert commentary track as well.  Best bit: Tempramental star Tallulah Bankhead apparently rarely wore underwear on the set, and was not the least bit shy around the other actors and crew (oddly enough, Casper fails to address this in the scene where Bankhead is clearly not wearing a bra, her right nipple visible through her wet blouse).  We also learn that Hitchcock refused to make any more films at Fox after the studio got cold feet when promoting the film, due to early (and preposterous) allegations that the film might generate sympathy for the Nazis due to its treatment of the lone German character aboard the boat.

Lifeboat certainly belongs in any Hitchcock fan's collection.  I would also recommended it for anyone who enjoys WWII films; while not a typical war picture, it is clearly a product of that time.",1200096000,3,2525,5.610526315789474

The story is set entirely on a lifeboat, which is a microcosm for the concerns of World War II. Hitchcock ultimately makes the point that even ordinary, peaceful people must sometimes do terrible things to defeat a ruthless and brutal enemy.

Hitchcock set himself tough limitations in this film and only a director as great as him could have made this work so well. Hitchcock would soon push the experimental boundaries further with films like ""Rope"" (1948) and ""Under Capricorn"" (1949) with their long, complcated takes.

""Lifeboat"" is startlingly different from other films made around the same time. It is a mature film that stands outside the immediate concerns of WWII and explores more universal truths.

The film is superbly presented in this 20th Century Fox DVD release.",1183939200,4,845,5.101449275362318
371526,5,6301798732,"John Steinbeck's LIFEBOAT gets the Alfred Hitchcock effect.  In Hitchcock's film adaption, the story revolves around eight stranded passengers who's ship goes down in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II.  Indeed, this is a character study of the human intricacies, stereotypes and clash of cultures and inferior complexities, that occur during times of war; the film is a reflection of World War II, and the social atmosphere that was quite similar to the animosity and uneasiness that occurred during World War I, which involved xenophobia.

Hitchcock glares a light on the the eight passengers.  Out of the eight, four stand out, and effectively keeps viewers at the edge of their seat as well as feel the tension, uncertainty, and fate of the rest of the characters in the film.  Willy (Walter Slezak) is the stranger and distrustful German captain who presumably blew up the passenger ship and one of the characters Hitchcock casts a sharp focus on him, and journalist, Constance Porter (Tallulah Bankhead), a woman who clings to her materialistic possessions, and there is one scene where she weeps about her Cartier bracelet because she used it as fish bait. The only African American character in the film, George `Joe' Spencer, the ship's steward, played by Canada Lee, is one of the symbolic characters in the film, who was a convict in another life, but now has reformed.  Also, worth mentioning is Gus Smith (William Bendix), an American who is in conflict with his German ancestry, loses his leg from gangrene and later becomes delusional and light-headed and imagines he's back home keeping track of baseball stats and awaits the day when he will see his girl; unfortunately, Gus does not get the chance.  In addition, the passengers are at odds with Willy.  Hitchcock subtly shows the passengers' resilience of taking any drastic actions against Willy, and throughout each scene where conflict occurred, the rule of law constantly loomed over their heads.  However, the concluding scenes are the most pivotal and may raise questions.

Overall, LIFEBOAT is unpredictable and intense.  But it is a significant film that takes place during World War II (note the concluding credits to the film, and you can see in the corner an advertisement to buy war bonds), and how individuals react during uncompromising situations Therefore, this is an unforgettable and highly recommended film.",1182211200,4,2398,5.107416879795396
371527,5,6301798732,"LIFEBOAT is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most accomplished--yet cruelly underrated--films.  It stars the fabulous Tallulah Bankhead with a superb ensemble cast; the story of a group of survivors from a bombed freighter, fighting for their very survival in a flimsy lifeboat.

As the film opens, we see the freighter's smoking chimney stack sinking beneath the waves, miscellaneous floating debris, a pack of cards and a chessboard.  The lone occupant of the lifeboat is revealed as Connie Porter (Tallulah Bankhead), an acerbic globe-trotting reporter, casually smoking a cigarette with her hair perfectly coiffed and draped in a mink coat.  Connie soon helps gather the few survivors of the sinking, which include young nurse Alice (Mary Anderson), a reformed pickpocket (Canada Lee), a millionaire industrialist (Henry Hull), a grieving young mother (Heather Angel), wounded boiler-room worker, Gus (William Bendix), and wisecracking Kovak (John Hodiak).

The lives of the lifeboat passengers are put in untold jeopardy when one of the German crewmembers who helped to sink their freigher is rescued and brought aboard.  What are his true motives?  And why does he seem so willing to help them?...  Walter Slezak delivers a fabulous performance as the never-named German sailor.

Acclaimed John Steinbeck (""Of Mice and Men"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"") wrote the screenplay, the very first piece he wrote exclusively for the screen.  While this is very much an ensemble piece, Tallulah Bankhead can't help but dominate with her gorgeous beauty and casual wit (and after all, the audience is first introduced to her).  John Hodiak, Hume Cronyn, and especially William Bendix, are all memorable here too.  Playing the two other females onboard, Heather Angel and Mary Anderson must fight for screentime (Bankhead was a notorious scene-stealer), but manage to make a solid impression.

LIFEBOAT is a very important film in the World War II era of Hitchcock's career.  There is no doubt that he wanted to get people talking about the palpable threat which Germany posed to the free world, and within the confines of a lifeboat, that threat and premise is explored and played out brilliantly.  As a paradox of the times in which it was made, LIFEBOAT delivers handsomely, and still offers gripping entertainment today.

371548,3,6301798732,"Yes, this is a well-made film which is filmed superbly well, but the message driving the film is overbearing.  The scene: Chance brings these shipwrecked folks together on this Lifeboat. The players in this character study courtesy of John Steinbeck, by way of Hitchcock, include: a former crook trying to go straight, a girl who soon goes overboard once her baby dies, a seemingly useless rich industrialist, a simple regular quiet guy, an apprehensive nurse-gal, a superbly dressed lady (even on the lifeboat) who is a reporter, a German sailor, and 2 working class guys. Of the latter one concerns himself thinking of his girl back home while the other comes across as a pseudo-intellectual pretender. Ignoring the supporting cast, we are left with 3 points of interest herein: Kovac, the pretender; Connie, the society reporter (very ably portrayed by Tallulah Bankhead); and Willy, the wily Nazi whiz who seems skilled in everything. Sounds dull, doesn't it? Oh, pardon me. I'm forgetting the spice to liven up this water-borne play. Connie provides this by verbally pegging Kovac as a ""fellow traveler"", later calling him (albeit sarcastically) ""tovarich."" Definitions: ""fellow travelers"" were folks who supported & sympathized with Communism, without being card-carrying party members; and ""tovarich"" is Russian for comrade. Thus it becomes political; a triangular treatment of the Nazis, Stalin's USSR, and the monkey in the middle ""West""---ie., a materialistic well-off lady; one who, moreover, actually interprets between the two. Story details: thanks to Kovac's stubborn anti-German antagonism he is able to bully the others into trusting him over the German, who argues that Kovac's ""course"" will lead them further away from land. Kovac doesn't know anything about sailing, but thanks to his ""gut"" inclination assumes he is in the right. After the German earns their trust by saving the other working-class guy's life, Kovac relents on pursuing his course; and begins passing the time playing high-stakes cards with the rich industrialist. How he is able to possibly cover the sums he is wagering, however, is ignored. I'm going to own one of your factories when we're done, he even tells the rich man. (And we are supposed to believe that this millionaire would gamble large sums with a working-class guy with no apparent assets?) Then later we find out that, actually, Kovac was right about what course to take (after it was too late) and that the German had duped them. Moral: never trust a Nazi & give the benefit of the doubt to ""the Left."" Even Connie, in the end, falls for Kovac; his brawn (he goes topless the entire film) and his evincing leadership being apparently enough for her. No, I'm not calling Hitchcock a leftist. Moreover, I think he is generally brilliant---""The 39 Steps"" is one of my all-time favorite films; ""To Catch a Thief"" & ""Vertigo"" are also superb. I'm just saying that the script (by Steinbeck, a rumored ""fellow traveler"" himself) betrays a simplistic dichotomy---the idea the Left wishes all to believe exists between ""progressiveness"", as evinced by the Left and Fascism. Remember this film was made in 1944; when Stalin's Soviet Union was an ally; when the Soviet Union's economic system was still thought worthy of emulating by some. Even if you think me nuts, do reserve judgment & at least consider the points made herein next time you chance to see this film. Then decide.

371549,4,6301798732,"There is nothing terribly subtle about ""Lifeboat."" After a merchant ship is sunk by a U-boat during WWII in the Atlantic, a varied group of survivors must interact on the only surviving lifeboat. There's a rich guy and a rich gal, a poor al and a poor guy, a black guy, a tough guy and a German guy. The social prejudices of the 1940s are all on display. Social correspondent Connie Porter has managed to gain a seat with her fur coat, movie camera and typewriter in tow. Others, like John Kovak (John Hoviak) arrive on board dirty and with little more than the clothes on their backs. The film revolves around relationship of the Americans and English with the German U-boat captain Willy (Walter Slezak). Hitchcock seems intent on lampooning those who in the 1940s harbor humane attitudes toward Germans. To his credit, Slezak is no caricature of the sneering Nazi; his menace is quiet, thus more insidious and all the more dangerous. Hitchcock seems intent on warning his audience against trusting Germans. By the end of the film, his characters' actions have turned from insouciant, ineffective and fawning to (appropriately to the film's moral code) murderous. It's hard to know whether Hitchcock was studying human nature's tendency to group violence or trying to incite it. The film was released in 1944, after all, and the outcome of the war was still not completely certain.

Technically, the film is masterful for its era. Trying to make something of the limitations of a rather small ""set,"" must have been a challenge. Luckily, John Steinbeck's script crafts plenty of earnest, distracting drama from the guilt, ennui, snobbishness, sickness, madness and class conflict between the lifeboat's occupants. In one poignant moment, when a vote is being taken to determine the boat's new skipper, Gus (George 'Joe' Spencer), the lone black man on board hangs back. ""Aren't you going to vote?"" someone asks. And in an all-too-real reflection of mid-century American racial realities, Gus exclaims in shock, ""I get to vote?""

Lifeboat had too few of these kind of moments, and too may of the manufactured kind. The rich slowly lose everything. The poor find comfort in venting at the rich and at falling in love. But it's not very convincing to see forty-something Tallulah Bankhead vamping as a siren to the young sailors. And I am still trying to work out the message of the movie. The film ends with the survivors on the verge of rescue. But what have they learned? How have they changed? And is it for the better?

Masterful for its day, a tad hokey and morally ambiguous. But it's Hitchcock and worth a viewing.

The DVD extras aren't bad - the movie promo material gives a view into 1940s movie marketing.

The film is set in World War II... An Allied ship was sunk by a German U-boat and a mixed bunch of survivors got away in the lifeboat... The enemy submarine was also sunk by the explosion and its Nazi commander joined the survivors in their lifeboat...

At first they were prepared to throw him overboard - but it was his skill which saved their little craft and gradually, while the allies were torn by dissension, selfishness, divided aims and views, his single-minded strength of purpose and his disciplined abilities took command... Unknown to the others, he was stealing their rations to keep up his strength, and directing them towards a rendez-vous with a German supply ship...

Tallulah Bankhead, incidentally, dominated the acting of the whole fine cast except possibly Walter Slezak, as the Nazi... As the woman journalist, keeping close to her material possessions, and only emotionally more friendly, she gave a performance with the power and the pain of a thirty feet salt wave...

It is ironic that the film's propaganda message, which I believe weakened and over-simplified it, was widely misunderstood at the time... Hitchcock intended to show at that stage of the war that the democracies should settle their differences and unite forces against the common enemy, who was disciplined, strong, and knew just where he was going... Instead, a lot of people attacked the film for showing the strongest character as the Nazi!

""Lifeboat"" is an interesting thriller from the mounting tensions of the interplay of conflicting characters, trapped and isolated in the planks of their little boat...",1167955200,5,1877,5.003205128205129
371554,4,6301798732,"Alfred Hitchcock, arguably the all time master of suspense, made a bold and controversial statement for his time with the movie Lifeboat.  It can be called a study of social classes, a comparison of what happens when people are forced together in a life and death situation.

After an Allied Freighter is hit by a torpedo launched from a German U boat, one lifeboat becomes the salvation for eight very different people.  A sophisticated and world traveling journalist, a rich industrialist, a tough as nails merchant marine, a military nurse, an engineer, an injured sailor, a mentally unstable woman, the radio operator and a steward.  As these people come aboard one by one, they begin piecing together what happened.  They are soon truly stunned when they pull the last survivor on board, one of the German sailors from the U boat, which was also sunk by the freighter's deck gun.

When the dialogue starts, things really begin to unravel.  They aren't sure if they can trust the German sailor.  Is he the Captain?  Or is he just a deck hand?  Does he know the correct course to Bermuda or is he leading them into the hands of a German supply ship?  The suspense doesn't end as the questions find answers.  As circumstances become more bleek and the tensions begin to rise, the fate of the group becomes more indeterminate.  A few of the performances stand out, particularly Tallulah Bankhead as the journalist and William Yetter as the German sailor.  The screen play, which is based on a play, contains dialogue between the characters that remains sharp and focused throughout.

I usually find the pace of older movies a little too slow and plodding.  It's a generational thing, I'm sure, having grown up on the faster-than-light age of modern movies and TV starting with Star Wars in 1977.  But Lifeboat (and most other films by Hitchcock) moves with great ambition, the story told only through dialogue and a sharp mix of character contrasts.  The affects are dated, but what needs to be focused on is the plot more than anything.  What Hitchcock does most brilliantly is make us feel confined to the boat with these people, as if we are trapped with them and involved on the decision making.  Many of the actions of the survivors can be considered controversial or against social norms but one thing is for certain; despite the age of this movie, relations to the characters can surely be relevant today.",1167696000,6,2413,4.782608695652174

371577,4,6301798732,"Lifeboat (Alfred Hitchcock, 1944)

You take a John Steinbeck story, have Jo Swerling (Pennies from Heaven) adapt it, and get Alfred Hitchcock to direct, with a cast including Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Hume Cronyn, Henry Hull, and Walter Slezak, among others. How can you not have a hit?

Lifeboat is a simple tale: a ship has gone down, torpedoed by a German U-Boat that was destroyed soon after. A number of survivors struggle to a lifeboat, one of whom is a crewman from the U-Boat. Second-guessing, paranoia, and power struggles ensue. The best thing to do: get out of the way.

And that's pretty much what Hitchcock does; each of these characters is invested with a distinct, well-drawn personality, and given the situation, they're bound to clash on their own. Change a camera angle here and there, perhaps, but let the characters do their thing. There's a minimal plot (regarding, of course, the eeeeeeeeevil German-- let's remember this film was released during the darkest days of World War II), but this is a movie that's really about these characters and how they interact with one another. And it's fascinating. *** ",1156377600,,1136,4.963157894736842
371578,4,6301798732,"A story that demonstrates the range of human reactions to adversity, particularly when dealing with the tragedy of war.  Hitchcock, as usual, shows his ability to underscore a story with pointed visual cues that complement Steinbeck's pared-down style and Jo Swerling's screen adaptation.  This is a tightly constructed film with a host of excellent character actors.  Tallulah Bankhead is marvelous on so many levels, but the ensemble is what eventually tells this story best.

Hitchcock uses his deft touch to bring the audience into the story, setting the scene early with the light repartee of Bankhead's character, that slowly evolves as the back stories of each character create a series of events that force each character to confront what they hold most dear in their lives.

This is not a lighthearted film.  You will see yourself in the strengths and weaknesses of each character, drawn from the spectrum of humanity during wartime.  By the end, one could easily consider this something of a war propaganda film, but it also leaves you with a few thoughts to ponder about human frailties that make it more a commentary than an exhortation to take up arms against a dastardly enemy.

If you are a Hitchcock fan, this is a must-have.  The DVD quality is satisfactory for a restored B/W film, but it's the story that grabs you and holds you, and it's Hitchcock's masterful direction that makes it all work so well.",1155859200,2,1421,4.912133891213389

371580,4,6301798732,"I was excited to see this film released on a ""Special Edition"" DVD.  Of all the contributions that DVD's have made to film and video entertainment, restoration of classic films does not get its share of credit.  Having said that, this is a great early Hitchcock (Pre 1950) to watch.  Like the later Rope and the immortal Rear Window, this film uses the Hitchcock ""clostraphobic"" set where the entire film takes place in a single setting -- in this case, a lifeboat in the middle of the Atlanic ocean.  Each character represents a particular cross-secton of society -- one member from the wealthy class, one from the working class, crewmembers, an officer, a nurse, and so forth -- again, typical Hitchcock.  A young Hume Cronyn is among the cast.

The film, like some many of Hitch's is a masterpiece of direction.  This movie works because it comes down to the actors, the script, and very simple set -- nothing else.  The views on Nazi Germany civilization are really what make this film worth watching.  Especially since this film was made during WWII.

My only problem with this version is that video quality is about what I would expect from a VHS tape after several viewings.  This package is billed as a ""Special Edition"", and yes, there are a few nice extras, and yes this is an old film, but had a little time and effort gone into some video restoration, which is not that big of a deal for a B&W movie, this really could have been a sensational DVD on par with the special editions of Casablanca or Citizen Kane.",1153353600,3,1522,4.5793357933579335

A timely example of how a microcosm of Western Civilization manages to co-exist.  Excellent casting, direction, cinematography, writing and casting all blend seemlessly to make a completely compelling 96 minutes of cinematic excitement.

Dr. Casper's enthusiastic commentary is most interesting, as is the featurette about the ""making of"" the film.

371582,5,6301798732,"It's an old adage, but with a different twist in the case of ""Lifeboat"". World War II enemies destroy each other's ships. A Nazi U-boat Captain (Walter Slezak) is rescued by eight survivors on an Allied lifeboat who form a microcosm of American/British society. They befriend the Captain, albeit with some suspicion, only to eventually discover they had every reason to mistrust him. Such is the premise of John Steinbeck's novella ""Lifeboat"", which Alfred Hitchcock then ingeniously adapted for film.

Imagine a U-boat Captain who has a friendly and helpful demeanour, yet ruthlessly plots his own survival. Is this not the stuff of a genuine adversary? He never reveals the compass he keeps in his possession, thus guiding the lifeboat towards a Nazi supply ship. He goads and pushes injured merchant seaman Gus (William Bendix) overboard while fellow passengers are sleeping, particularly crewman Sparks (Hume Cronyn). He pretends at first to understand only German, when in fact he speaks at least three languages; only an attractive journalist (Talullah Bankhead) is conversant in either language. And he hides food tablets and water from the others. Is this not the worst kind of enemy?

Odd as it may seem, influential critics in 1944 failed to equate the treachery of the U-boat Captain as symbolic of Nazi ideology. Although it received three Academy award nominations, ""Lifeboat"" was subsequently panned as too soft on Nazism. So reviled was the film, it was banished into virtual obscurity. When it was eventually released on VHS, only a damaged master tape was available. In time an unblemished master was found and used for this DVD issue.

Equally fantastic is the fact that it was filmed in a huge pool set up on a stage. Yet, surprisingly it has the look and feel as though it took place out at sea. Even more amazing is how Hitchcock sustained the suspense for 96 minutes.

In addition to this great film, the DVD contains interviews with Hitchcock's daughter and granddaughter who share their recollections. Steinbeck and Hitchcock scholars add their input into the origin of the story and making of the film. And advertisements, theatrical posters and newspaper articles of the film are likewise included on the DVD.

If you've not seen this Hitchcock film, get it. It ranks among his best achievements.",1150329600,6,2322,5.052219321148825
371583,5,6301798732,"This film is quite a unique Hitchcock film.  The Master of Suspense was at his best, but this movie does not have his typical flavors.  This movie tends to lean towards the wartime propoganda movie, and why not?  It was made in 1944 when the sentiments toward Naziism was not very positive.  After all, the basic philosophy of the Nazis was that one person was better than another and it was their job to rid the world of the weaker ones.  This movie does a good job of weaving suspense through a topic that no doubt created many different feelings for the people who watched this film.

The characters are interesting as there is a good cross-section of life portrayed.  Some start out hating Nazis, and some are more inclined to doing the ""fair and proper"" thing, but in the end, the bad guys are portrayed in a bad light, and the good guys in the war triumph--kind of.  It's really very difficult to triumph in a movie like this: there is suffering and sadness and ""scoundrelry"" to spare.  I guess I consider the triumph more in terms of when the film was made and what the obvious point of the movie was.  This movie had an agenda, and it was a good agenda in my opinion.

And all of this from the greatest suspense director of all time!  If you keep a sharp eye out, you can see him do his traditional cameo!",1149465600,,1313,4.336065573770492
371584,5,6301798732,"A really unusual and interesting wartime drama with a stellar cast and unique situation. Filmed mostly on the one set, the boat, and using water tanks and rear screen projection, Hitchcock created a real challenge to himself, his cast and his crew by setting the entire film in, what else, a lifeboat drifting out at sea after a wartime maritime disaster. This is a brave film on a number of levels. One: The difficultly of shooting believable footage in a controlled environment. Two: Getting a script good enough to hold audiences interest for the length of a feature film that is set only in one place. Three: Casting actors capable of achieving an ensemble of interesting personalities that mesh so well together while being drastically different. Four: Convincing that cast to allow themselves to endure the kind of abuse that this picture needed to get the realism required. Five: Including some pretty grim and seedy elements in the script including death, betrayal and the ugly as well as the noble side of human nature. Six: Portraying the enemy. (A Nazi) as one of the characters in the film at the height of World War II. And yet, this film rises to the occasion, entertaining, thrilling, shocking and even teaching as it does. Tallulah Bankhead is luminous as the gutsy media correspondent of the day, but the rest of the cast, every last one of them, keeps right up with her and the film remains taut and flawless from the first frame to the last.

Fox did not oblige Steinbeck.",1142467200,7,323,5.09433962264151
371618,5,6301798732,"Alfred Hitchcock always put together cinematic experiences that astound, bewilder, and amaze.  In the years before World War II, Hitchcock efficiently capitalized on the politically tense atmosphere in Europe through suspenseful spy dramas such as The 39 Steps (1935), Sabotage (1936), and The Lady Vanishes (1938).  During the Second World War, he continued to display a thorough understanding of political climate and fear that it generated in the American people and the rest of the Allied world through Saboteur (1942) and Lifeboat (1944).

Besides Hitchcock's extensive wisdom of the political and social world, he also illustrates a brilliant mind for the human psyche.  Both the social and psychological world in which people coexists subtly materialize in his films through an intricate web of truths and lies, as emotions efficiently cloud the thoughts of the characters.  It is a notion that emerges exceptionally well in Lifeboat, where Hitchcock allows the audience to submerge themselves in a tale thick of psychological undercurrents that feeds on the fear spawned in the social and political world of the 1940s.

It begins with a promise of horror and fear that enters the audience, as the music screams chillingly out of the speakers.  The opening music serves the great purpose of keying the audience into the severity of the catastrophe in the beginning, and to what dreadfulness waits.  Through the opening credits the black smoke races out of a ship's chimney, as the steam whistle uninterruptedly shrieks its alarm.  Symbolically, it might warn the audience of dangerous times ahead while it more directly implies that the near future in the film will provide danger and suspense.

Hitchcock was also a genius at applying symbolical items within the mise-en-scene that the audience understood.  Lifeboat is no exception even though the whole film takes place in the small lifeboat.  On the contrary, the opening montage offers a clear indication of how clever Hitchcock was in using items to bring out feelings and moods within the audience.  The opening displays the aftermath of a Nazi torpedo that has sunk a delivery vessel, but in the process faced its own doom.  Through a few, but strategically placed items floating in the water Hitchcock says exactly what he wants, and more.  The symbolical value of the mise-en-scene continues to enhance the cinematic experience throughout the film.

Ironically, Hitchcock allows the audience first to meet greedy reporter Constance ""Connie"" Porter (Tallulah Bankhead) floating along in the lifeboat.  The fog wraps around her like a hidden secret while she notices that her pantyhose have a run in them instead of trying to find survivors.  In a distance, she hears the voice of John Kovak (John Hodiak) calling for help while swimming to the safety of the lifeboat.  Callously, the audience learns about Connie's persona, as she in feverish joy explains how she documented the passengers' fierce struggle for survival while the ship was sinking.  It is not until Kovak begins to search for other survivors that the lifeboat begins to fill up with people.  However, Kovak is not without flaws, which slowly begin to emerge through his inferiority complex.

Amidst the other passengers that join the lifeboat the audience will learn about a class struggle, love story, the tragic loss of a child, deceit, and war between nations, as one of the survivors turns out to be a Nazi sailor.  These side plots enhance the complexity of story, as the struggle for survival continues.  Within the complexity of the story, fear brews stronger, as it also allows the monster of each individual to emerge regardless of nationality.  However, a notion that Hitchcock cleverly presents is the notion of reasonable fear depending on situation, as the fear of death shadows the thoughts of the survivors in the lifeboat.  Yet, the human side of each character also presents some interesting notions in regards to understanding and indifference.  Through the many different characters the audience will find at least one person they can identify with, which allows the viewer to take long and hard look into their own character and discover our own shortcomings and strengths.

Hitchcock concocted a masterful thriller while World War II still ran hot in Europe and Asia.  In fear to how the audience might have reacted to the film, the studio only gave the film a limited release, which gave it poor box office earnings.  Regardless of its earnings, it is a great film providing the audience with a meaningful cinematic experience with suspense in which the audience can ponder the notion of reasonable fear.",1141516800,11,4658,5.139257294429708

371623,5,6301798732,"This review is for the 2005 Twentieth Century Fox DVD.

The movie doesn't waste any time assembling ten adults in a lifeboat that was launched from a sinking freighter torpedoed by a German U-Boat in the Atlantic during World War II. Nine of the crew came from the freighter, while the tenth is a survivor of the U-Boat, which was also sunk during this confrontation.  The more notable characters include: a world famous news reporter, Connie Smith (Tallulah Bankhead); a U-Boat Captain (Walter Slezak); a freighter engine man, John Kovac (John Hodiak); a freighter captain Gus Smith (William Bendix); and a wealthy industrialist, 'Ritt' Rittenhouse (Henry Hull).  The survivors are confronted with plenty of moral challenges among themselves as well as battling nature with very limited food, water and other life-sustaining essentials.

There's rarely a dull moment in this film as the freighter survivors are faced with many moral dilemmas including saving a person who is responsible for sinking their ship and killing hundreds of their fellow crewmen.  Murphy's Law (if something can go wrong, it probably will) seems to also run amuck in this story.  Since it was made and released during WWII, there's clearly a sense of Allied moral superiority.  The best performance and screen presence far and away is by Tallulah Bankhead, but all of the other actors give stellar performances.  Canada Lee's recitation of the 23rd Psalm is simply great!  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it clearly has Hitchcock's artistry and personal touches throughout the film including his clever cameo appearance.

As for the DVD, Hitchcock fans like myself who have seen this on VHS have been aware that the image quality has been always been suspect and there was great hope and anticipation that the DVD would offer an immaculate presentation of the film.  This wasn't the case as parts of the first 15 minutes show some of the same water-damaged image problems revealed on the VHS videos.  Fortunately, this happens during scenes where its foggy, so it's not a devastating issue, but one would have hoped that Fox could have either found some secondary sources or meticulously restored these damaged segments.  But in spite of these technical shortcomings, I would still strongly recommend viewing this movie.  There are several worthwhile bonus features including how the film was shot in Fox's studio and commentary by film professor Drew Casper.

""Lifeboat"" is a wartime propaganda picture, certainly, but also one of the director's early American classics. It would be notable if only because it showcases the Broadway star Tallulah Bankhead in her only film role worth watching or even remembering.

Hitchcock, working from a story by John Steinbeck, presents a microcosm of Americans and Brits clarifying the strengths and weaknesses of a world at war. Only the German U-boat captain, in an indelible performance by Walter Slezak, is able to cope. The star turn by Bankhead, as a dilettante reporter, is bruising to behold today. ""Lifeboat"" took some flak as undermining the Allied war effort.

I believe Lifeboat was Hitch's only production for Fox, and now we can compare treatments. Just look at the first reel of this film: what an embarassment. I've seen better image quality on late-night TV (with the rabbit ears on). Fox just couldn't care enough to spend the time to locate the best elements.

Then there's the making-of documentary. Can someone PLEASE ask Pat Hitchcock to give it a rest? And now we have Hitch's grand-daughter dispensing useless drivel? Come on. Where is the contemporaneous commentary, either from Lifeboat folks who are still alive or from archive footage. Again, Fox just couldn't care enough to do any heavy lifting.

""Special Edition"" doesn't mean that a title has been lovingly restored but that's usually the case.  The bad news is that ""Lifeboat"" has been transferred from DVD from the same water damaged negative (interpositive or print or whatever was used as the source) that was used for a laserdisc edition and earlier video edition from the 90's.  A classic early bit of Hitchcock that makes a lifeboat a microcosm of our prejudice infested world, ""Lifeboat"" is set during World War II.  Hitchcock approached John Steinbeck to write a treatment and screenplay with the basic plot already sketched out for Steinbeck. Although Steinbeck did do a single draft, most of the script was written in collaboration with producer Kenneth MacGowan, Alam Reville Hitchcock and Tony Award winning writer Jo Swerling (""Guys and Dolls"", ""Pride of the Yankees"") in collaboration with Hitchcock, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay in 1944.

After a German U-Boat sinks a ship in the Atlantic, ten people  survive the sinking in a single lifeboat lost and largely forgotten by the rest of the world. Shipmates Gus Smith (William Bendix), John Kovac (John Hodiak), the radio operator""Sparks"" Garrett (Hume Cronyn), an African-American steward named Joe (Canada Lee) and a small group of surviving passengers Alice a nurse (Heather Angel), the wealthy Charles Rittenhouse (Henry Hull), Photographer Constance Porter (Tallulah Bankhead) finally a shell shocked mother (Mary Anderson) whose baby dies in the attack.  When the passengers find another survivor things become nasty; the last survivor is a German officer (Walter Slezak) whose U-Boat is taken out after destroying the ship. When food disappears suspicions run rampant.

 Unfortunately, ""Lifeboat"" is one of a handful of Hitch's undervalued classics that probably wouldn't appeal to many people beyond Hitchcock fans and older movie buffs. The blacks are solid and there's nice detail visible throughout the presentation.  The analog mono sound occasionally sounds a bit thin particularly when the music swells up but the dialogue is clear and crisp.

""The Making of `Life Boat': Theater of War"" features Hitch's daughter Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell, film historian Drew Casper and others discussing the production. Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell  points out that star Tallulah Bankhead had the role of Constance Porter crafted for her by Hitchcock with his collaborators. Bankhead never wore underwear so the crew would get a thrill every time she walked up the ladder and got in the lifeboat. At one point there was a complaint from the cameraman that every time Tallulah spread her legs the shot was ruined because you could see her pubic hair. Hitchcock loudly mentioned that he wasn't sure if he should call make up, hair dressing or wardrobe to deal with the issue. It became less of an issue after that. Bankhead continued to cause various problems by referring to actor Walter Slezak as a Nazi off camera and belittling screen vet Henry Hull because he kept forgetting his lines or muffling them during takes. Bankhead developed pneumonia during the shoot putting it further behind schedule. Hitch's granddaughter. The featurette at about 20 minutes has quite a bit of behind-the-scenes information included in it. We also get a stills gallery.

Professor Drew Casper who holds the Alma and Alfred Hitchcock chair at USC gives a very good commentary track. Although it's clearly written out almost as a lecture, Casper delivers his presentation with insight and trivia that will keep Hitchcock fans enraptured.

A terrific underrated Hitchcock classic that has been improving with time, ""Lifeboat"" got roasted by critics and Steinbeck scholars during and after its release. Why the critics didn't go overboard with praise has something to do with the time and expectations for Hitchcock's films.  The performances work so well precisely because most of the actors did not get along with star Tallulah Bankhead during the shooting of the film. Reportedly Bankhead didn't wear any underwear during the shoot which used to irk one of her co-stars so much that when she used to step over him in the lifeboat, he complained directly to Hitchcock.

Fox's new DVD edition does come with a terrific featurette detailing the production of the film as well as a great stills gallery that features images of advertising, publicity articles and contest materials. Drew Casper's commentary also puts into perspective the important placed ""Lifeboat"" occupies in Hitch's body of work.",1129420800,17,4656,5.24764468371467
371661,5,6301798732,"The most remarkable thing about this particular movie is, it all takes place on one small lifeboat with quite a disparate assortment of characters. We have the glamourous, sophisticated woman about town, Tallulah Bankhead, who is simply fantastic and completely unique as befitting a movie star of the time. Aloof, she eventually succumbs to emotion and becomes human, one of the survivors for real instead of acting in a play, at first.

William Bendix plays a sympathetic man who has suffered a serious leg injury, necessitating the amputation of the limb on board and during rough seas with no anesthesia....to add further insult to injury, he loved to dance with his girlfriend, Rosie. Bendix is great, as always, but his finest performance ever, IMO, was in The Hairy Ape.

Walter Slezak is the most insidious and evil force in this tiny segment of society, and he is wonderful in this role.

Mary Anderson perfect in her role as the ethereal, vague lost soul who finally finds true love aboard the little boat.

John Hodiak is excellent and entirely believable in his role as the tough guy who falls hard for the seemingly distant, unattainable Bankhead, more attainable than he first thought, happily for both.

Henry Hull is the best here; he is just superb and grinds away at the forlorn stub of cigar ever present in his mouth. The hard millionaire, he eventually adopts a more human persona and is very funny at times. Just the right touch.

Heather Angel is heartbreaking and her part is brief but very moving.

Hume Cronyn is great; calm, soothing and sturdy, he is the stalwart of the group and supports everyone in need.

Canada Lee is the lone black man here, and lends stability and sanity to the terrible position everyone is in...the deeply religious and conscientious one, a great person to have under any circumstances, but especially vital here.

Of course, for those who try to find Alfred Hitchcock's signature appearance in all of his movies, you must pay close attention here...he had to be very creative in this instance!

John Steinbeck wrote the story and his touch, as well as Hitchcock's, is evident throughou",1128902400,,2140,4.870523415977962
371662,4,6301798732,"Have looked at this one already.  I must first say that it is GREAT to have this film out on DVD.  The extras are a bit slim (an audio commentary by an Academic type and a decent ""making of"" featurette).

Warning to those expecting a restoration:  this is the same print/source used for the prior laserdisc and VHS editions (new transfer, of course).  It has the same ""water damage"" to the picture (water spots).  I guess a better source print does not exist.  It remains quite watchable, though.

Despite that negative comment, get this one!",1128556800,5,542,4.631578947368421
371663,5,6301798732,"Hitchcock was a master. Some of his best movies took place in a small area such as an apartment, ""Rope"" and ""Rear Window"" are good examples. This movie takes place in a smaller area, a lifeboat. The character development is incredible. You get a rounded group like you might expect to find on a wartime freighter. A socialite reporter, working man's man, girl next door, elderly tycoon, young mother, sailor, et cetera. We feel as though we are on that boat with them. They must try to survive with limited supplies and determine who to trust. When someone supposedly commits suicide they must figure out if they did or if they were murdered. The fact that one among them is a survivor from the U-boat that sunk their ship makes the tension even higher. Psychologicially this is one of Hitchcock's best. If you like any of Hitchcocks movies you will probably love this one. If only suspicion was the only problem, but they must deal with not only their personal differences but their almost hopeless situation. After all they have to find the way to a friendly ship and hope they have enough water and food to make it. Add to that an injured man needs a limb amputated and you begin to appreciate all the complexities of the movie. I have all the other classic Hitchcock movies. This was the only other great movie he made that was not available on DVD. Now that I have it I am happy. Other than what appears to be waterspots on the first few seconds of the movie, the rest is quite sharp and beautifully restored. The sound is excellent. The additional features of commentary and making of documentary are nice touches. I highly recommend this classic.",1126137600,4,1653,4.606779661016949
371664,5,6301798732,"Lifeboat is an early masterpiece from Hitchcock, whose today is better know for his colour-period other masterpieces like REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, THE BIRDS, etc.

But this great film (I guess, the only one he made to Twentieth Century Fox) is one his best works from his american B&W period along with REBECCA and NOTORIOUS. And it shows....

Lifeboat was a play by John Steinback, in which, after a dramatic sea battle, a group of passengers get together on a lifeboat after the ocean liner they were travelling at gets sunk by a german U-boat (that also sunk).

This premisse is the perfect environment for Hitchcock to show his best characteristic: a director who loves to work under self imposed constrictions so he can turn these same constrictions to his own advantage. The constriction I'm talking about is his best mark: closed spaces, single settings, the challenge of making the audience unaware that they are in just one big room.

Stranded in the middle of the Atlantic we see a micro society: the rich spoiled girl in a mink coat (Talullah Bankhead in a great role), an industrialist, a sailor, a mother with her dead baby, a nurse, a engeneer, a steward... and the german captain from the U-boat that was responsible for the whole tragedy.

As the survivors try to cope with their new condition, they cannot agree on the direction their lifeboat should take in a desperate attempt to reach an allied ship. Should they trust one of theirs and risk to die adrift... or should they trust the wise experienced german captain who may or may not be leading them towards a german ship that may be somewhere close.

And then comes the question: is the german captain a prisoner of the group... or is the whole group prisoner of just one german?

Can you believe the dramatic possibilities of such an idea?

Well... being a Hitchcock movie, you'll never see a dull moment... nor the camera stuck by the fact we are in just one set. Everything in this movie is right... actors, cinematography, direction, special effects... everything in this movie is a great example of classical Hollywood... and the story has great pace... and never lets the audience for a moment feel bored. There's plenty action, suspense, tension, drama... even murder.

Talullah Bankhead's character is unforgettable as a rich, spoiled reporter whose practical spirit is always ahead of problems... she is always chicly and stylishly helping everybody. My favorite quotes: ""Dying together's even more personal than living together""; ""In a word: Wow!"" and the best one... ""Darling, some of my best friends are in jail""

Finnaly, Fox is releasing this great film in a restored edition. Full of nice extras and in a beautiful package.

Hurray!!!!",1123977600,163,2739,4.894168466522678
371665,5,6301798732,"I have a pal at Fox Home Video.  The reason we have all been waiting for this release is due to the poor condition of the original film elements.  For those of you who owned the laserdisc edition, remember that the first reel was plagued with water damage (almost fitting for this type of movie).  Rumor has it that this fine grain master print was the best Fox had available at the time...that the negative was not around...not necessarily lost, just not able to be located.  My buddy tells me that this is no longer the case and that restoration work has been ongoing for the better part of a year on this title.  Hopefully it will be worth the wait.",1122508800,95,652,4.355371900826446
371666,5,6301798732,"This beautiful Hitchcock picture is the only classic missing from my Hitchcock collection, and I'm sure that others feel my pain here. While Universal put TWO box sets out, WB put out their set recently, and the Criterion Collection showed up with five (with three sadly going out of print... not before I nabbed them, though, heh heh), Hitchcock has all but been firmly placed on DVD.

Now, maybe Fox had a good reason for keeping Lifeboat from us. I just wish I knew what it was. They've made bad decisions before (skimpin' on My Neighbor Totoro [where's the original Japanese language track? special features?] for those Miyazaki fans out there, for example), but this was just nutso. By releasing this, they'll probably make a good buck or two, cause Hitchcock nuts like me are about ready to kill for it by now. I just wish they'd done it earlier.

As far as the picture goes, it has been bagged on by many people because it's more or less a one-set picture with the same cast the whole movie (sorta like Rope). But let's be honest. Movies have never needed to fit any one person's formula to be ""cool"" enough for the general public. In today's day and age, kids are raised on The Matrix-paced movies (I liked the Matrix, but I'm just drawing a parallel here), so maybe more lethargic movers like Lifeboat are just not entertaining enough for the youth, but for those willing to give it a chance, it's an awesome movie with a stellar cast, good themes, and awesome dialogue.

Even Harry Potter readers need to conquer a Tolkien or two now and again to understand the lines between art and entertainment.

371699,2,6301798732,"A ship is torpedoed in the Atlantic ocean. One lifeboat has a famous reporter in it, and the other survivors climb aboard. They are a diverse group that will provide dramatic tension. The last survivor is from the U-boat, which creates a discussion on his acceptance. One political question is: who is to steer the boat? Should the technically qualified U-boat skipper do it, or should the politically qualified crewman do it? The survivors make the right decision. Another question is whether a leg should be sacrificed to save a life (the lesser evil). The operation takes place and succeeds through the skill of the U-boat skipper. The recurring question is whether they are on the right course (a symbol of politics?). But a storm blows them off course (nature and events upsets their plans).

They lack food and water, but appear mot to suffer. Their talk about restaurants symbolizes their hunger. Their small talk reflects their backgrounds, and their differences. But Smith goes overboard, and the angry crew sends the skipper after him. Now they seem hopeless. But Connie chooses to use her diamond bracelet as a fishing lure, and they catch a fish (wealth to serve the people?)! The sighting of a ship causes the loss of the lure. At first it appears the enemy supply shop will rescue them. But a distant warship shells and sinks the supply ship. The film ends with the rescue of another enemy seaman.

371700,5,6301798732,"Tallulah Bankhead was one of the 20th century's best actresses, taking over from Ethel Barrymore as the Toast of Broadway and the London stage.  She made few films, and this is her best role.  (For a very long time the joke was that Bankhead's stage roles were taken over by and became film hits for Bette Davis.  Certainly that's true with Hellman's THE LITTLE FOXES.)  Here, one has the opportunity to observe how an actress of supreme talent, handles a role in which everything is shown; in which practically nothing can be hidden.  Every would-be actress ought to study not only what she does, but more importantly, what she doesn't do, for as a stage acress par excellence all through her younger years, some movie people thought her too big for the screen.  Probably she wasn't, but simply needed a good director.  Here, she got the best in the business, and the results show.

Hitchcock was fascinated with women, with actresses, and  particularly beautiful ones.  And, if Connie's beauty here, is not young, and fresh, it is nevertheless, compelling.  She is like a thoroughbred mare among mules and cab nags in an auction pen of chance.  She stands out because of her breeding.  She has lines.  Her costume?  A white silk blouse, good nylons, a full-length mink coat, and a diamond bracelet.  And, of course, that wonderful mane of natural, blonde hair.

If you study Hitchcock, it would make a wonderful double bill to see LIFEBOAT and STAGE FRIGHT close together.  Here, he studies Bankhead; in STAGEFRIGHT he studies Dietrich; two fair-haired actresses of wildly differing personal style, but of exceptional power and interest.  And, what they have in common and what both display in these two films, is their unusual, and unusually expressive voices.  Bankhead was a famous radio actress for many years, as well as a stage star.  Dietrich too was a radio actress, and all her life was a singer and recording artist.  The trick in working with an artist with an exceptional voice, is to carefully trim and arrange the dialogue in such a way as best to show off the voice's characteristics.

Admirers of Lesbian Chic might want to imagine what Ann Sheridan, or Barbara Stanwick, Rosalind Russell, Ruth Hussey or Lizabeth Scott or any one of a number of others might have done with this ""Contralto"" role:  You know, the wise-cracking, hard boiled newspaper dame.  The role is a Type, very popular during the 30's, and with a lesser actress and a lesser director, we might have gotten a good movie out of the material, but not a black-and-white masterpiece, like this one.  After all, what if CASABLANCA had been cast with Ronald Raegan and Heddy Lamarr?

You can watch this movie over and over.  A director's tour de force, the trick, I think, is to watch for Hitchcock's cutting sequences; the way he manipulated the editing around the actors' speeches within the episodes.  Extremely clever.  So good, the seams are nearly invisible.

Its a great propaganda movie, but of an unusual kind; far subtler than most.  Its a great Camp, or G/L movie, but again, far subtler than most.  Its a great Murder movie too, etc., etc...",1083456000,5,3134,4.808988764044944

A case could almost be made that this film was made for the Germans!  Certainly, Slezak's Nazi captain was the most sane and rational of the film's characters.  The histrionics of some of the other members, particularly Hodiak's bigotry, only confirm this observation.  However, Ms. Bankhead's part is the central one, and she plays this for all it is worth.  It is only a short while after the beginning of this film that the concept that it is made on only one movie set recedes.  As with a one-act play, with the proper cast one set is all that's necessary.  Of course, as with so many classic films, it's impossible to visualize any modern actors capable of duplicating these performances.
