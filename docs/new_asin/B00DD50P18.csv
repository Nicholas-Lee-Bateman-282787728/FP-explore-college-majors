5792663,5,B00DD50P18,"Sye Ten Bruggencate is teaching Christians how to show professed atheists that they cannot rely on their own reasoning to deny God.  He does it in a down-to-Earth way that most can understand.  He has opened up the presuppositional apologetics arena to the everyday man and woman.

If you have been afraid to tackle this subject before, get this DVD and be prepared to engage your unbelieving family and friends!  You'll watch it over and over as you master different areas of thinking.  It is great for a Bible study group!",1375228800,12,524,4.714285714285714
5792664,5,B00DD50P18,"Me and my brother watched this and loved it. Sye Ten Bruggencate gives a great Biblical way of answer unbelievers, particularly the atheist who loves to argue and wants evidence. Sye Ten Bruggencate shows anyone how they can give a proper defense of the faith, without having to be very knowledgeable.

I highly recommend this DVD, it's great for watching in a group.",1373155200,11,367,4.825396825396825
5792665,2,B00DD50P18,"I believe God. Jesus Christ is God! I affirm the Trinity. Christ died and was resurrected on the third day so that we can have life (John 3:16-18; Rom. 10:9-10; 2 Cor. 5:16-21; etc.). From Genesis 1:1 through Revelation 22:21 - the Scriptures or the Holy Bible IS Infallible & Inerrant Word of God to mankind! Matt. 24:35 ""Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away."" (i.e. Matt. 5:18) BUT 2 hours I watch the movie if the want to call it that...2 or 3 minutes out of 2 hours I liked.

5792666,1,B00DD50P18,"Sye's particular brand of street theatre blends the proven techniques of confidence tricksters with the absolutist arrogance of right-wing reactionaries.  His argument, based upon Cornelius Van Til's TAG, is as widely debunked in the Christian community as it is in academia.  This is largely due to the fact that his many get-out-of-jail-free cards draw conclusions from their own proposition, rather than present an objective appraisal of the facts.

Sye has had this explained to him by every single person he has ever debated in an open forum, where he has no control over how comments are edited after the fact.  Indeed many Christian scholars have pointed out to Sye, that by playing games with the basic definition of words like 'proof', 'fact' and 'evidence', he merely highlights the inherent weakness of his argument; where instead of presenting an argument which is open for debate, he insists that unless you agree to play along with him, you aren't entitled to comment.

But rather than acknowledge this, adjust his argument accordingly, and engage in rational discourse with people in a respectful manner, he resorts to threats, post-hoc censorship, and blatant theft -- both of intellectual property, which he downloads from the internet without permission, and by cutting and pasting sections of text from blogs and comment forums which he himself did not write -- conveniently, of course, missing out the parts which contradict the thin narrative he wishes to spin.

I do not know which part of ""Do not bear false witness"" Sye doesn't understand, but his practised and deliberate misquoting of those who have repeatedly proven his argument false should be of as much concern to anyone willing to hand money over to a company like Crown Rights Media, in the mistaken belief they are a well-intentioned Christian organisation, as it is to those of us who aren't afraid to speak the truth about them, and their questionable financial arrangements with small-minded liars like Sye Ten Bruggencate.

If you want to learn more about who these people really are, and why they don't want those of genuine religious faith to know about their money making scam, Google their track-record for yourself.  And don't, whatever you do, waste your money on this manipulative nonsense, designed to closedown rational free enquiry in the exact areas where it most needs to be encouraged.",1377820800,9,2386,5.115681233933162
5792667,1,B00DD50P18,"I have had many run ins with Mr. Bruggencate.  He is obnoxious and pious.  I'll sum up the movie for you so you don't have to waste money on his scam of a ministry.  ""Could you be wrong about everything you know?  If you don't know God then you can't be right about anything.""  He is fond of the phrase ""How do you know your reasoning is valid?""  The problem with this phrase is that validity is the product of the application of the rules of formal logic. Therefore, there is an actual set of rules to follow to know your reasoning is valid.  Bruggencate, Hovind and the rest of this clan are simply out to take your money from you by claiming they can give you answers so that you won't look foolish in front of your intelligent friends but only ends up showing your ignorance further.",1375315200,8,787,4.277027027027027
5792668,5,B00DD50P18,"I watched the documentary because I hope to be an apologist one day, and because Christians are commanded to be prepared to give a defense (1 Peter 3:15).

This DVD shows why even some of the most established apologists such as John Lennox and William Lane Craig are not only going about their work unbiblically, but sinfully. I was also making this same mistake and so I would recommend the DVD to all Christians.

If you're interested in apologetics, the DVD is great for rewatching numerous times in order to perfect this biblical technique.

Sye's teaching is matched with the professional creativity of 'The Chocolate Knox' in making the movie.

You won't be disappointed.",1375315200,3,677,4.912280701754386
5792669,5,B00DD50P18,"""How To Answer The Fool"" is excellent course for beginners wanting to learn how to respond to those who claim that God doesn't exist or want you to prove that He does.

It will make many people see things in a whole new light.  I have watched it a couple of times since the church I attend went through it already in Sunday School.  You may at first be taken aback, but if you are a Christian and love God you will see that this is all about believing your Bible and not as complicated to understand as you might think.

If you want to learn what presuppositional apologetics is in a simplified way and how to apply it to communicating with the unbeliever, this is for you.

This doesn't replace the giving of the Gospel, but when people are not open to listening - this apologetic is a challenge to their worldview.  This can then be applied to others who are not ""atheists"" as well which can lead to a discussion/proclamation of the Gospel.",1375228800,4,942,4.354285714285714
5792670,1,B00DD50P18,"Sye Ten Bruggencate's take on the Van Til/Bahnsen Presuppositionalist argument is all bluster and no substance. If you ever face this guy allow him to ask his first question - 'could you be wrong about everything you think you know?', and reply 'No, I could not, because I know at the very least that I exist and that I am thinking, and I know this with 100% certainty'. Sye will then have to reduce himself to absurdity by arguing against your ability to think or recognise the self, whilst simultaneously accepting both those facts by interacting with you.

Then you should ask him if he's omniscient, as he insists that one has to either be omniscient (or know someone who is) to be able to know anything - sadly for Sye this means that he would have to be omniscient to know that the revelation he claims to have had is genuine, as (by his own argument) there could be something else out there that could disprove it.

In the past Sye has even admitted that his position is entirely faith based (just search Youtube for 'Sye Ten Bruggencate owned')

So not the slam dunk that some Christians think it is.",1375228800,12,1108,4.502487562189055
5792671,5,B00DD50P18,"Crown Rights has done an excellent job creating this one of a kind film. Content was highly interesting, learning how Sye ten Bruggencate witnesses to a lost and dieing world using presuppositional apologetics with the universal understanding that, ""God has revealed Himself to all men so that they are without excuse"". Sye does not use typical evidence for God type stories to try to prove to the atheist/agnostic that there is ""a"" God but by using the scripture only, proves that there is ""The"" God and that the atheist, who God Himself calls a ""fool"", knows it. I also really enjoyed watching live street, or open air preaching, I found that to be thrilling. Now as Sye would say, ""Read your Bible and believe it."" I would give this more than 5 stars if possible! God Bless, Pam Warden",1375228800,4,788,4.676258992805756
5792672,2,B00DD50P18,"I've watched this video a few times and as Much as I want to love it, I just can't. I'm a believer in the presuppositional approach, I think it is a death blow to atheistic arguments. However, the way Sye does it just drives me nuts. A good apologist doesn't just come with a better argument he comes with a teachers heart as well. Sye does very little to guide the hands of the lost to help them see he just keeps repeating himself over and over and over and over until they just get fed up and leave. Now I will say this, he is in the right to do so, they are ignorant and he can just keep saying it because it is true, but it doesn't help them. In fact in this video we see only one person who might ""get"" it. The rest is a little bit of him arguing with people and Sye talking about this method. It is not an instructional video on how to do this apologetic nor is it full of interesting exchanges. The way it was shot is fairly well done, but it can't make up for the lack of material. From this video someone might almost learn how to engage the lost but it also might encourage them to be really annoying while doing it.

I have watched many of Sye's debated and this video suffers from the same thing his debates do. Greg Bahnsen was good at being patient and communicating this idea in a way intellectuals could appreciate. Sye just puts himself on repeat and waits until they get too frustrated to continue. He seems to have a good heart and a love for the lost and we can commend him on that. I'm sure he helps but in my opinion the bull in the china shop might help you find what your looking for but he makes a mess while doing it.",1375228800,16,1644,4.058461538461539
5792673,5,B00DD50P18,"I never write reviews on Amazon but I could not help myself when I saw this film on here.  I cannot recommend this DVD more highly.  It is thoroughly biblical, entertaining, and will change the way you do apologetics.  Sye is engaging, intelligent and hilarious.  If you want build confidence when doing apologetics/evangelism with an unbelieving world; you need to study, believe and proclaim the teachings of the Bible.  This video will show you why that approach is the biblical one and how it plays out in normal conversation.  Thank you American Vision and Sye for your efforts.

5792674,5,B00DD50P18,"A MUST HAVE for any who wish to learn apologetics the correct and biblical way. Sye not only elaborates on the reason for a presuppositional approach, but he sets forth the methodology and demonstrates the same in real life situations. It is in these situations that the power of this approach is made evident and all too clear.

Included is a study guide, and taken together along with the video would make for an excellent resource in a church/Sunday School/small group setting.",1375228800,8,480,4.853658536585366
5792675,5,B00DD50P18,"After watching this many times, I am still trying to wrap my brain around the Biblical truths taught and modeled in this fantastic video. As one who was trained in evidentialism, this teaching has definitely challenged the way I defend my faith in the God of the Bible. The style is captivating and nicely paced, but the content is... profound in its simplicity. I have already shown this to many friends and will continue to recommend it to everyone I can. For better or for worse, Sye ten Bruggencate is now the voice in my head when I am witnessing to those who claim that there is no God.

8592097,5,B00DD50P18,"Im embarrassed to admit this but it took me nearly four years after this documentary came out before I finally got around to watching it even though I have been following apologist Sye Ten Bruggencate and sharing his materials since his early days of appearing on the radio show Unchained Radio.  But watched it I did!  I purchased two set of it, one for myself and one for our church.  Sye Ten Bruggencate is a proponent of what is called Presuppositonal apologetics, a school of apologetics that began with Cornelius Van Til.  Sye breaks down Presuppositional apologetics barney style for more people to understand.  Over the years many people have come to embrace Presuppositional apologetics through Syes ministry which include this DVD that was produced by Marcus Pittmans Crown Rights Media.  I welcome that fact.  If you haven't heard of Presuppositional apologetics as a Christian this resource might be useful to you.  Heres my brief review.
The documentary is an hour and twenty six minutes long.  It features Sye Ten Bruggencate taking Presuppositional apologetics to the streets, typically in college campuses as he is open air preaching.  As the documentary progresses Sye is interviewed before the camera and also lecturing to others in a classroom format concerning the problem of other apologetics methodology and what a Presuppositional approach looks like.  Syes biggest contention is that we must be biblical in our apologetics.  Some of the quotes from mainstream leading apologists today are disturbing and as someone who have read a lot of traditional evidential and classical apologetics I think Sye and the documentary represented them fairly.  Again the documentarys main theme is that Christians must be biblical.  Most Christians take it for granted that we are to be Christians in our behavior and our conduct in family life and work but us being biblical does not stop in the area of apologetics.  Too often Christian apologetics allows the unbelievers autonomy to be unchecked and not adequately dealt with at the level of their presuppositions.
I realize that for some watching this can be a rather new experience.  This is where I am glad that the producers have included the study guide with the DVD set on the American Vision website.  The booklet exceeded my expectation and you see good work was put into it.  Since I know Presuppositinal apologetics can be so counter-intuitive the first time hearing it (it was definitely for me) I think the booklet helps to fill in things that cant be all covered in an hour and a half documentary.  If you are a Christian and you want to dismiss Presuppositionalism after watching it, please consider reading the booklet first.
I watched this documentary together with some of the men in my church whom I am discipling in Presuppositional apologetics.  I thought it was useful as a teaching resource as a supplement to our readings and our get-together for teaching, questions and answers, etc.  I thought the way the documentary ended was very sobering about the condition of some who engage in apologetics and call themselves Christians but don't submit to the Lordship of Christ and the authority of the Bible.",1491264000,,3187,5.032380952380953
8592098,1,B00DD50P18,"As someone who has studied apologetics on both the undergraduate and graduate level, I can personally attest to the merits, as well as complexities, of the different approaches. Very smart men disagree in earnest but typically with respect. Mr. Bruggencate is not one of these men. I found him to be exceptionally crass and arrogant, as did others watching. I don't want to be overly provocative here, but it appears as though this DVD was filmed just to puff Mr. Bruggencate. Watch it for yourself and see if I am wrong. For example, there is a lengthy vignette in which Mr. Bruggencate goes on some radio or podcast program and argues with the host and producer, that is entirely a waste of time to watch. As Bruggencate enters the place where this program is being recorded, rock music starts playing, as though he were a boxer entering the ring for a fight. I wish I was joking.

Mr. Bruggencate mocks books by guys advocating evidences for the Christian faith, claiming that this somehow makes unbelievers the jury/judge when it comes to deciding whether or not God exists. What he doesn't seem to understand is that this is merely a subjective fiction on the part of the unbeliever; their decision doesn't actually make God a defendant, anymore than they are a judge in any ultimate sense. It's just a way of stating things. For Mr. Bruggencate, however, such expressions are sacrilege of the worst sort, and he apparently has no time for it. The funny thing is, I agree with presuppositional apologetics in principle (though not as an evangelistic technique). But I also understand and appreciate the role that classical and evidential apologetics play. More than that, I know men whom the Lord saved through an examination of these arguments. I wonder if Mr. Bruggencate would regard their conversions with suspicion since they were not persuaded by presuppositional arguments.

I would avoid this DVD at all costs.",1465344000,,1923,4.895705521472393
8592099,2,B00DD50P18,"Like another reviewer I watched this dvd and tried to like it but could not.  I do prefer, and practice, presuppositional rather than evidential apologetics and while the logic that Sye brings out in this dvd is sound it will not by itself win anyone to Christ.  He seems to be more interested in winning an argument, or even just getting in to one, than directing lost sinners to Christ.
If we presuppose that the Bible is the Word of God then surely we must believe that it is not only inerrant but also sufficient and if we do believe that it is sufficient then surely we should use it... most of the people I've spoken to don't believe the bible but when they are confronted with the Law and are enlightened to God's grace there seems to be a light that goes on... i.e. the Word works!

If you want to argue with people, sometimes successfully, then get this dvd but if you want to see people saved I wouldn't bother with it.",1464912000,2,929,4.327586206896552
8592100,5,B00DD50P18,Sye Ten Bruggencate and his ministry in apologetics has really encouraged me and equipped me to take my faith to the streets with confidence. This DVD is phenomenal!!!,1446076800,,167,5.0

8592104,1,B00DD50P18,"After purchasing this video/workbook, I was jazzed. I'm a presuppositionalist and I love apologetics, so after viewing the trailer, the combination seemed rather intriguing and compelling, especially being couched in cool graphics and edgy audio. To my amazement, I was thoroughly offended by Sye's approach. I watched it 3 times to make certain my reaction wasn't simply emotional.

There is a move afoot, primarily within reformed evangelical circles, that is decrying all methods of evangelism other than presuppositional apologetics. This, according to Sye (the video producer), is THE way to do evangelism.

I thought Sye's methods were deliberately confrontational, argumentative and downright arrogant. Quite frankly, though I have been a committed believer in the sacrificial death of Christ for more than 40 years, I often found myself on the side of the ""fool"". Not that I agreed with their unbelief or was sympathetic to their level of self-sufficiency, but felt that they were being abused by Sye's antics. As their words were being cleverly manipulated, Sye acted so smug and condescending. In my view, he was simply engaging in the same circular arguments his opponents were attempting to use against him. After each confrontation, I said to myself, ""This is utter futility.""  Is this truly the evangelism of our future?  Where was the Gospel? Where was the love of Christ?

Sye's argument goes like this:

1. ""The Fool"" asks the Christian for some measure of ""proof""
2. The Christian provides what they believe is ""convincing evidence""
3. ""The fool"" is thereby granted full authority to act as both judge and jury

So what!  If I offer the reasons why I believe Jesus Christ is the Savior, or why I believe God exists, I quite frankly don't think I am aiding and abetting a mocker. Quite frankly, every person must come to God by faith and the person who rejects Christ is no more dead in their sin before their encounter with the Christian apologist, than after. The only difference is that the mocker's well, that is engaged by the presuppositional apologist, will undoubtedly be poisoned.

In showing this video to quite folks, I was careful not to prejudice their opinions. To a person, without exception, each was offended by Sye's style and appalled by his level of arrogance. What my friends and I want to know is, in what way were the atheists and agnostic combatants ""evangelized""?  Was the Gospel ever presented? Were any of them persuaded by Sye's style.  Were they less or more likely to be open to the Gospel in the future?

This, in my view, is no way to express the love of God.",1384387200,7,2608,4.929223744292237
8592105,5,B00DD50P18,"We live in a post modern society where the ABSURD claim ""truth is relative"" is actually believed. It is the bedrock of the atheism, agnosticism and nominal religiosity of our day. Here Sye Ten Bruggencate exposes this for the folly that it is in a creative and engaging fashion. He seeks to share the true Gospel of Jesus Christ to unbelievers, without dishonoring the Lord in the process by attempting to put Him on trial for the unbeliever to judge. Bravo!",1381190400,,458,4.666666666666667
8592106,5,B00DD50P18,"How to Answer The Fool is a great DVD to see presuppositional apologetics in action. My wife thought Sye was treating the atheists he encountered in this  DVD rudely, but what he says is so true. How much more love can you show for someone than with the absolute truth? And yes, absolute truth exists. Otherwise, everything you say cannot be taken seriously, or even worth listening to. More importantly, Sye's approach is founded in the Bible. The scenes where Sye is front of a Bible study class were a nice touch to the rest of the DVD. The 57-page study guide of the same name compliments the DVD very well. The book seems more loving and has the same biblical truths as the more confrontational-oriented DVD.

I have seen Sye on the Creation Today show (or whatever the title was back then) hosted by Eric Hovind (and now co-hosted with Paul Taylor) a couple years ago. It was my first introduction to presuppositional apologetics. It took a while for me to understand presuppositional apologetics as I had to overcome my own modern, faulty interpretations. I plan to use presuppositional apologetics when talking with anyone who wishes to listen. I plan to mix it with the Way of The Master approach by Ray Comfort depending on whom I am talking with at the time.

God Bless!",1378771200,4,1281,4.65929203539823
