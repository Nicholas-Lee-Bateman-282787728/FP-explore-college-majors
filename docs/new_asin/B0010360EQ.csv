The live footage is wonderful, and I really enjoy and appreciate the sections where the guys are hanging out being themselves.",1341619200,,282,4.66

I highly recommend it to everyone.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incubus-Look-Alive/dp/B000X1L8RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incubus: Look Alive</a>",1304208000,,321,8.470588235294118
8236705,4,B0010360EQ,"I'm a Huge fan of Incubus from the days of Fungus Amongus to Look ALive and this DVD is Great with the exception that you don't really see the concert it's like the director is on crack switching scene to scene to much to me at least, but mainly talking about the close ups of the band, but I'm just saying I love the band, but I'd Like to see them Playing there instruments not just their facial expressions, then a jumps here, then a cymbol crash there, then a fan here, then a finger on guitar, then brandons face for 20 seconds, then a glimps of lights on something? But the footage is really good just a little to much at one time. Not Saying not to buy it, by all means it's great exspecially the cd, Enjoy make your own opinion, don't go by just mine, buy the DVD it is really cool!",1196121600,2,789,4.096774193548387
