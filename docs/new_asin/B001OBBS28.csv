8330173,4,B001OBBS28,"This TV-documentary was made in the early 1990s and so much has happened since then.  Here, Ron Jeremy's hair is black, and now it's salt-and-pepper.  Both Cal Jammer and Jon Dough have committed suicide.  They show ""Jake"" as a camera man with brown hair.  Jake is now a porn star named Jay Crew and he has salt-and-pepper hair, rather than salt-and-sage.  Although women make more in porn than men, they have shorter careers and I don't know if any of the women here are still working.  Peter North looks pretty much the same, add a wrinkle or two.
Although made in the 1990s, this is full of 1980s signifiers: big eyeglasses, mullets, and big hair.  You see video cassettes, no DVDs in sight.  This was very diverse in terms of sexuality, showing gays, straights, lesbians, and bisexuals.  There is little frontal nudity, but a lot of everything else.  If you can't learn enough about the porn industry, then you should see this.  It was entertaining and informative, despite its age.",1257465600,5,986,4.741176470588235
