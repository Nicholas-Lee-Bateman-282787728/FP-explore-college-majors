6987777,5,B00SJ9U8P6,"Awesome movie.

If certain movies gets your gears moving like American Psycho and Fight Club, then YOU MUST BUY THIS. And if you like dubstep, this is your movie with your name on it, so just buy it already.",1432598400,,207,4.3076923076923075

6987779,5,B00SJ9U8P6,"Fast paced movie about a abused teen who grows up seriously mentally ill,hearing murderous,self destructive voices. Unable to fight off the voices,he sinks into a dark dangerous world. Well done and good acting.",1426809600,2,211,5.424242424242424
6987780,4,B00SJ9U8P6,Awesome movie. But I thought the ending was pretty predictable from the beginning or beginning middle.,1426723200,,102,5.4375
6987781,3,B00SJ9U8P6,"Can there be real help for people so damaged by their past that they inflict their pain on others.  They really do not want to, but they do.  How many more young people are out there?",1425254400,,183,4.055555555555555
6987782,3,B00SJ9U8P6,That was one messed up date movie. It's about as horrible as a date could get. I wouldn't doubt this movie is based on true events but it make no such claim. I hate to think such people maybe walking the streets instead of locked in a straitjacket.,1425081600,,248,4.1875
6987783,5,B00SJ9U8P6,Great movie with great acting. It was a little slow moving but the ending was well worth it and the emotion in the film was spot on. Definitely worth your time to watch.,1424044800,5,169,4.151515151515151
8698503,2,B00SJ9U8P6,"I gave this 'stuff' 25 minutes of my life.  it is difficult to watch because of the boredom and extremely difficult to listen to because of the background sound that we are told is music.  no thanks to the actling, script and camerawork.  obviously there is no direction.",1531008000,,271,4.604166666666667
8698504,1,B00SJ9U8P6,The good parts are confusing and the ending is weak,1481760000,,51,4.2
8698505,5,B00SJ9U8P6,A disturbing look into what can happen when families are in denial and mental illness is left untreated. This movie was one I won't soon forget. Pretty scary when you think of how many people may be in this situation now but are not getting the help they need. I recommend.,1467849600,,273,4.372549019607843
8698506,5,B00SJ9U8P6,Absolutely awesome movie. Must watch til the end!,1456704000,,49,5.25
8698507,5,B00SJ9U8P6,"PQ looked great to me.  No complaints.

I liked it.  Personally I enjoyed it.  That's all I can say and remain neutral.",1445904000,,119,4.2727272727272725
8698508,2,B00SJ9U8P6,"Just OK - watchable but pretty predictable. It does bring to light the mental disorders than are rampant in our country and with lack of proper treatment, just how badly things can turn for these damaged people.
Nikkie Reed is a terrific actress, didn't recognize anyone else here, but all except a few did a good job.
If you're looking for a horror movie (and one reviewer inexplicably called this a 'date movie - why?""), this isn't it. It's a pretty predictable stalker movie but with good explanation into the background and motives of the perpetrator.
Watchable, but not great. And for people that write reviews that say 'couldn't make it past 10 minutes' - don't waste everyone's time if you didn't watch the movie.",1438560000,2,720,4.768
8698509,1,B00SJ9U8P6,"Complete idiot low budget film riding entirely on what appears to be a so call ""re-make"" Watched less than ten minutes and turned it off- WHY we can not get a refund on this stinker is beyond me... I am a big fan of Amazon but this no-refund policy on digital is making me re-think my referrals.",1437955200,,295,4.192982456140351

8698511,3,B00SJ9U8P6,"The plot has been done many times before but it was entertaining.  The acting was good, especially the teen girl main character",1437523200,,127,4.7727272727272725
8698512,5,B00SJ9U8P6,"A fantastic portrayal of how people with brain disorders can be dangerous. A great twist at the end. A well written, directed, etc... film. The acting was great. And, for those that have dealt with this situation, I believe it to be informational as well. THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT MOST PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISORDERS ARE IN ANY WAY DANGEROUS AS THIS FILM DEPICTS THEM TO BE AND THE DANGERS THIS FILM ARE NOT AT ALL THE DANGERS THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL EVER HAVE TO FACE FROM PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISORDERS. That being said, this film does give GREAT examples of what may be, AND ONLY MAY BE, danger signs from a mentally ill person.",1434412800,,624,4.387931034482759
