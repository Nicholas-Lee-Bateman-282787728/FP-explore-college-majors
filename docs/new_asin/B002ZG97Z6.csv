----------------
How could a wimpy kid who is so different form everyone else defy others' expectation and become a true hero and leader?

In the new DreamWorks animation action-adventure thriller ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" Hiccup, an eccentric adolescent with a weak build but a strong sense of humor, lives on the Island of Berk, a bustling place full of imposing, muscular Vikings, led by ""Stoick the Vast,"" the Viking Chief and the father of Hiccup, who could not hide his disappointment for his only son.

In Berk, fighting swarms of nightmarish dragons is a way of life for centuries.  Gobber, the comical blacksmith and dragon fighting coach, is one of Hiccup's few true friends.  Gobber lost his arm and leg from earlier dragon fighting.  He has a unique ""no-nonsense"" style of training, making his apprentices ""throw themselves at the dragons.""  He figures that the ones who survive will surly survive on the battlefield.

Another genuine friend of Hiccup's turns out to be one of a different kind: a ""Night Fury"" dragon, the most intelligent and mysterious kind that nobody else had ever seen before.  One dark night, Hiccup captured an unseen creature with his own flying net.  The next day, he saw the Night Fury dragon: pitch black, fierce, but also injured and helpless.  Seeing the fear in its eyes, Hiccup set it free, a crime against the Viking's code of conduct!  Hiccup repaired the injured dragon's tail which he had shot off, and gave him his favorite food: fish.  In return, the dragon (whom Hiccup named ""Toothless"") took him on many thrilling flights and revealed to him the deepest secrets of dragons.

The secrets of dragons gave Hiccup a surprising edge in his dragon training, which shocked the formerly most promising Viking teen, Astrid, a new character absent from the original book.  Astrid, a hardworking and super-competitive girl, gradually warmed up to Hiccup as he shared his hidden world.

The problem is that Viking's sworn enemies are dragons, and with that risk, Hiccup cannot keep Toothless a secret forever...

In the end, Hiccup became an unexpected hero, using his hidden power, ultimately redeeming himself and changing the lives of every Viking villagers, forever.

My favorite part of the film is how Hiccup tamed Toothless.  The scene when Hiccup reached out his hand for Toothless to touch for the first time, is the most magical scene in the film.  My favorite character is obviously Hiccup, who seemed wimpy and different at first, but is the one with true power inside.  Hiccup and I also share a passion for dragon and drawing.  I was born in 2000, the year of the Dragon, and consider myself a ""Dragonologist,"" one of my favorite books that I own is ""How to raise and keep a dragon.""  I have drawn so many different kinds of dragons and made tin-foiled animal sculptures of dragon.

More importantly, Hiccup and I share a gentleness, innocence, and kindness towards other living creatures which enabled us to tame wild animals: dragons for him and a deer for me.  I still remember vividly how a beautiful deer approached me and licked my hand and head at the San Diego Wild Animal Park when I was three years old and just moved to San Diego from San Francisco.  I noticed that the deer did not lick any other kids even when they petted her.  It is easier to tame an animal when it has no fear for you.

""How to Train Your Dragons"" is an epic tale packed with adventure, action, humor, stunning 3D visuals and beautiful music.  I give it 4.5 starfish, it is as good as Up!  It is a film that I think every child and parent will love to experience.  The movie is about friendship, connection, redemption, and the hidden power of ""being different.""

This is the first time that I am invited to a film's press junket, held at the luxurious 5-star and 5-diamond rated Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills on March 20, 2010.  What an experience!  I gave it 5 starfish rating myself: I got to pick TWO favorite toys in the gift basket the moment my mom and I arrived, and another gift when we were checking out!  The fragrant air smelled like orchids and cinnamon, the food is amazing, and the service is even better.  Stacy, the nice waitress and I became instant friends.  I had a blast at the swimming pool with two boys from New York and London.

The coolest part of the press junket was interviewing directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, voice talents Jay Baruchel (Hiccup), America Ferguson (Astrid), and Craig Ferguson (Gobber).

When I shared my 4.5 starfish rating, the directors and actors were all curious about the missing half starfish.  I asked them: How could Hiccup survive flying on the back of Toothless at 50,000 feet in the air, without suffocating or freezing to death?  Directors Sanders and DeBlois laughed and joked that they would make sure to prepare oxygen tank and protective gear for Hiccup next time.

America Ferguson laughed so hard when I said, ""I guess it's poetic license,"" and became my instant fan!  America thought Astrid added a lot to the story because ""she was the best and always challenged Hiccup to be the person he should be.""  Craig Ferguson, who played Gobber, challenged me to take flying lessons.  He said the best part of his role in the film was not having to dress up for work!

Unlike ""Hideous Zippleback,"" the two-headed dragon in the film whose two heads fight all the time, directors Sanders and DeBlois have a warm friendship since their ""Mulan"" collaboration and share similar tastes in the kind of movies they like to make.  What happens when you disagree?  I asked.  ""Usually we make coupons for each other, so that if one of us wins this argument, the other can use the coupon to win the next one,"" said DeBlois.  Asked about the stunning designs of various dragons in the film, Sanders said, ""We worked with a terrific artist who designed over a thousand different dragons, some from the book, others from his own imagination.  Some of them are as good as yours!""  He was referring to my Chinese Imperial dragon I drew last year at Disney D23 expo.

Jay Baruchel and I shared thoughts about being different as I asked him how he drew his own life experiences to play Hiccup.  ""I remember all the other kids outside playing soccer or hockey when I was growing up, but all I wanted to do was reading comic books, watching cartoons, or write stories.  I was different just like Hiccup, and I always think of myself as the one with true power inside,"" said Jay, ""You need to be proud of how different you are, because difference is what makes the world interesting.  The people who have everything come easy, who don't have to fight for anything, who are everyone's favorite all the time, they don't have anything interesting to say.""  I couldn't agree more!

""How to Train Your Dragon"" is not only a thrilling action adventure, but also a tale with deep emotion and strong morale: Friends are more powerful than foes.  Being different empowers you to see what others cannot see.

4026587,5,B002ZG97Z6,"How to Train Your Dragon is the latest from the stable of Dreamworks, but apart from the animation style, you'd never know it.

How to Train Your Dragon is the story of Hiccup, a Viking who feels out of place since he's not a fan of killing the dragons the Viking's world so revolves around in. But, when Hiccup captures the rare Night Fury Dragon and inadvertently injures it, the two become fast friends and attempt to bridge the gap of understanding between the Dragons & the Vikings. It may not sound like much, but things are deeper than they may seem here, and they are 3 reasons you need to go out and watch this movie right now.

1: Casting: Having seen Jay Baruchel as a geeky character in the film Fanboys, this film only solidifies for me the fact that Baruchel makes cliched characters feel real & brings traits out they wouldn't have otherwise, and this fact is very evident here. The same is true for the rest of the cast. In Shrek 2, Larry King was wasted in a long-running and painful transvestite joke. Here, Craig Ferguson is perfect in the role not only because he's Scottish, but he brings the appropriate mix of eccentric leadership needed for the right-hand man of Gerard Butler's character, who is also well cast. The same goes for the rest of the cast with the possible exception of Jonah Hill, who always feels out of place in almost every movie he's in.

2: Visual Effects & 3D: Now this may because the Viking environment hasn't been portrayed much on screen before, but the film is stunningly beautiful, and that's only reinforced by the 3D which is used better than Avatar in some cases, especially in the case of the flying sequences.

3: The Emotion/Uniqueness of the Film in Animation Today: The story gives way to many emotional moments in the film, all of which are played perfectly. And, not to give too much away, but at the end of the film something happens the to main character that was not only shocking to me, since I'd never seen something of its magnitude done in animation period, but to me it was also one of the most tear-jerking moments, especially in relation to what it does to the relationships & similarities between Hiccup & his dragon in the movie.

Overall, how do you train your dragon? With charm, love, understanding, amazing visuals & stunning 3-D flying sequences. This film ranks up there with Pixar's best, and if I had any criticism towards the movie, it would be the fact that it's made by Dreamworks, and with their quality lately, you don't have high expectation entering this film. Nevertheless, How to Train Your Dragon gets a fire-breathing 5 out of 5.",1269734400,438,2620,4.589743589743589
4026588,5,B002ZG97Z6,"... there lived a boy who couldn't quite live up to the bar his father set for him in his life. Despite his efforts, he usually failed to the chagrin of the town and the man (his father) who was its leader. Hiccup (a quite apt and funny name for this lad) one night decides to prove himself by launching a trap for the nefarious ""Night Fury"" dragon, and surprise, he snags one. Finding it wounded in the forest, the boy learns not only how to care for and train his dragon, but also, how to find his own unique footing in his life. Such is the tale of the heart warming and wonderfully vivid family family, ""How to Train Your Dragon.""

Created by Dreamworks, which always seems to be in the shadows of the superstar Pixar, has finally come into its own with this cinematic experience. One of the first things you might notice is the spectacular flying sequences between Hiccup and Toothless. The magic of the animation is spotless, and what even makes it more breathtaking is the fact that there is little to no dialogue in these scenes. That adds to the splendor of seeing Hiccup fly, both literally and symbolically, over his village and life.

Dreamworks concentrated on the usual Pixar strengths, of story, of character, of heart. This movie has all three, and all three in spades. The ending of the movie, which shant be revealed here, is one worthy of a few Kleenex. I, a somewhat cynical and hardened viewer to sentimental scenes, was totally taken off kilter by the enchanting surprise of emotion embedded in the context of the film. Dreamworks nailed it.

Parents, be wary of very young kids seeing this film. I would have no problems having my second grader on up seeing this film, but anyone younger may have trouble with some scary dragon scenes, especially towards the end, warranting the PG rating.

However, what lingers with me after seeing this movie is the strong relationship threaded throughout, esepcially between our hapless hero Hiccup and his man-killing dragon Toothless. For ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is in itself a wonderful metaphor, for never judging people too harshly before one gets to know them a little bit, and the benefits reaped when one does. A bit adventure, a bit fun, a bit emotional, all makes for a wonderful time at the movies.",1269648000,4,2272,4.658354114713217
4026589,5,B002ZG97Z6,"The first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda were both very close to Pixar level in terms of storytelling, but How to Train Your Dragon is the best by far from Dreamworks. The animation is very high in detail, especially in IMAX 3-D, and the characters are not only likeable, but memorable. The main dragon, Toothless, is one of the greatest animated characters in a long time, and like Wall-E, he doesn't even talk. All of the other species of dragons also have unique looks and personalities. The flying sequences here really show the power of 3-D as a tool to put the viewer in the movie, not just a gimmick. I would say it's second only to Avatar when viewed through those funny looking glasses.

This film is more serious in tone than laugh out loud funny, much like the latest from Pixar (UP, Wall-E, etc.), but it does have quite a few laughs that come naturally, not forced. I'm so glad they stayed away from pop culture references. Both kids and parents will love How to Train Your Dragon equally and probably for much different reasons. The only thing that I didn't care for were the first 10 minutes or so. Not that they are bad in any way, but it felt a little rushed. Once the film settles and Hiccup (the boy viking) meets the dragon, everything begins to click. The only other negative is that every kid is going to want a pet dragon for their birthday. Good luck with that!

I have no idea why they removed most of the special features in newer releases, but this release has everything that I wanted and then some.

Pop up trivia - not really in depth, but basically with this turned on while watching movie, gives texual snippets throughout the movie.
Animators corner is fairly interesting - Give a PIP (Picture-in-picture) while the movie is playing. Might show the actor recording the voice at that time, the animator working out some details, etc.
The Technical Artistry of Dragons - Sort of the making-of the technical aspects of the movie, such as how the different types of fire was designed, etc.
Viking-sized Cast - The interviews and recordings of the actors.
Bunch of other stuff you might come to expect. Some DVD games, deleted scenes, interview with the person who wrote the original books, etc.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

4031999,5,B002ZG97Z6,I seriously love this movie even though I'm 24! I love how Toothless is like a giant fire breathing cat. Definitely recommend. The sequel is good as well,1460505600,,153,4.5
4032000,5,B002ZG97Z6,"So after being inspired by Game of Thrones and buying my very own dragon from a guy on Craigslist, I figured the next thing to do was learn how to train it before it got out of control and barbecued half the people in the neighborhood.
This DVD looked the very thing to help me do that. Unfortunately, on viewing said DVD I discovered that it wasn't a 'Dragon Whisperer' type of thing as I'd first thought, but an animated movie by DreamWorks.
Never mind, turns out it was a pretty fantasmagorical movie with some breathtaking animation that took my breath away and has yet to return it, which means I've now had to learn to breathe underwater until I save up enough money to buy some second-hand oxygen.
Luckily there were a few tips in the movie about how to actually 'train your dragon' but when I tried those things with my dragon it couldn't do any of them. The dragon in the movie was called toothless but mine was more like useless, so that's what I named him.
When 'Useless' still couldn't fly after a few weeks I became suspicious and inspected him more closely. It was only then that I discovered that I'd been ripped off and my 'dragon' was actually the Loch Ness Monster with a pair of flimsy fairy wings stuck on its back. When the authorities heard about it they made me ship 'Useless' all the way back to Scotland at my own expense. That's the last time I buy anything from craigslist.
Oh, well, at least the DVD was good, and you can still enjoy it, with or without your own dragon.",1460246400,,1498,4.372759856630824

I honestly think they could have put more humor in it. The ending was too intense for too long. It needed more humor put into it to break it up. (It's called letting your audience rest. Then you grab them again with action).",1459296000,,424,4.0476190476190474

The movie is a great one to watch with children, but it's still captivating with diverse characters and a plot dynamic enough for you to re-watch the movie (which I rarely enjoy doing).

One of the absolute best pieces of this movie is the soundtrack. I honestly love listening to the soundtrack when I need to work on a render or know I have a big deadline coming up!

I'd recommend this movie to children, parents, college students, and everyone in between.",1450656000,,602,4.564814814814815

4034143,1,B002ZG97Z6,"Do NOT watch if you've read the book. This is not a 5 star film even if I wouldn't have read the book. So many things wrong with it.

False Advertising
The words: ""Based on the book by Cressida Cowell"" is a lie. Taking scene, character names and title is not even ""Loosely based"". It is NOT ""How to train a dragon"". But not that Hiccup is a brave 10 year old boy who grows into a hero who is truly tasked with finding and training a dragon like all the other warriors in his home village. This movie should be called ""How to kill 2 dragons"", ""How to tame a dragon"" or ""How to get along with your father who hates all dragons"".

I am sorry if I have set the bar higher when it comes to my kind of entertainment. I am just tired of being tricked into watching a film with a guy flying passed rocks like Luke through the Deathstar or Harry Potter on Buckbeak with the standard dramatic, enormous battle scene and the unnecessary, overused boy gets girl scenes.",1441843200,,957,4.195652173913044

Contrary to a couple of negative reviews, I didn't find it boring at all -- it was funny (without a ton of potty humor or innuendo), touching, exciting, and had a feel-good ending. My son and I also observed, as sort of a moral to the story, that those who are angry and vicious are not changed by more anger and viciousness returned to them, but by kindness! The movie wasn't super violent -- however, there is the potential for younger kids to be frightened by the scary dragons.

Compared to many Disney and Fox family movies with dark elements too scary for children (take Princess and the Frog for example) this is a good all-around clean and wholesome movie that shouldn't easily scare or offend.,1423872000,,395,4.739130434782608

4036643,5,B002ZG97Z6,"The storyline met expectations in a not-necessarily-good way (can't say there were any real surprises).

Fortunately, the cast met expectations in a way that was good. It was an interesting move, casting Scottish guys as the adult Vikings. Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson pair off quite well.

The characters also blossomed nicely. I particularly like how Astrid (America Ferrera) starts out as a bully then takes on another dimension. The main dragon, Toothless won me over as well. (Not too shabby for a non-speaking part.)

The animation certainly met my high expectations. Kudos for that. The flight sequences were especially impressive.

Overall, this was very nicely done, and I enjoyed the second viewing more than the first.",1422748800,,733,5.239316239316239

4036715,5,B002ZG97Z6,Thank you to the reviewers who commented how the dragons are basically large puppies.  My 2.5 year old and 4.5 year old loved this movie.  The younger child sometimes struggled with the scary dragon until it would make a goofy face which looked exactly like one of our dog's many goofy faces.  We pointed out the similarity and then it became more funny then scary.  This is now one of the favorite movies in our house and has replaced Frozen as the most asked for movie.,1421712000,,471,4.441860465116279

I did a review saying that it was, and I also went so far as to say ""it might even be better than the first."" So, I got to thinking...I hadn't seen the first one since it first came out. I decided to watch it again. Wow. This is such a GREAT animation. There just isn't enough space to write the review that HTTYD#1 truly deserves! The characters, the dragons, the color, and the indescribable humor and happiness you feel as you watch Hiccup and Toothless interact and become hero's, best friends, and the beginning of acceptance into a society that was set in an unyielding, ancient ideology. Our own society could learn a great deal from this victorious animation. My hat goes off to the Author, Cressida Cowell (she allowed a great deal of leeway, and a huge change of her original story) she allowed them to make one of the best animation movies I've ever seen!

4038823,5,B002ZG97Z6,"Here's yet another great film that I missed the boat on initially. I typically stay away from kid's movies (save classic Disney) because they tend to be overly simplistic bores that would only entertain the youngest of children. HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is one of best of the lot, however, because of its excellent animation and a compelling story with themes that will resonate with viewers of all ages. The movie takes place in an indeterminate time period when Vikings and dragons coexisted, although not peacefully as the beginning makes perfectly clear. They're mortal enemies, in fact, and Vikings train from a very young age to be able to kill the beasts who raid their village and steal their livestock. Everyone, that is, except Hiccup. Hiccup is what you could call an outcast or a reject. He wants to join his peers in training, but nobody ever seems to want to give him a chance. Fortunately, he gets one, though not in the way you'd expect. As the title indicates, there is some dragon training that goes down, but not without a serious paradigm shift. At its core, this movie is about a young boy who doesn't quite fit in, yet finds a way to make himself valuable to the people around him. There is also a subtext about learning to empathize and/or come to terms with things that we don't understand, and therefore fear. Both of these messages are very pertinent to people, young and old, and are dealt with in a mature, yet accessible way. For the kids, you have the spectacle of expertly animated flying sequences and a killer battle with the big-bad dragon. For adults (and more discerning children), you have the meatier stuff about acceptance and overcoming your fears. It's really one of the best animated films I've ever seen, on multiple levels. While DreamWorks might have made their name with Shrek, I think that this will have a bit more staying power in years to come. In fact, this is so good that it pains me to even gripe about a single thing, so I'll make it brief. The setup of the movie is a bit roughly handled, and the characters (initially) aren't really given their due. But the movie improves drastically as it progresses, so much so that you almost forget the slightly weak first act. Overall, this is a movie I see myself watching again and again, and I'll definitely be checking out the sequel. Do yourself a favor and go watch this right now. You'll be glad you did.",1405987200,,2407,4.613053613053613

This dvd includes the original How To Train Your Dragon movie along with an episodes of ""Dragons: Defenders of Berk"" (the tv show based of the film), the short film ""Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon"", various deleted scenes from the film itself, and filmmaker commentary. I didn't know this edition had any extras when I purchased it, and I was delighted to find them along with the movie.

I only ended up buying this because I wanted to take my 3 year old to the drive-in to see the second one (we can't go to a theatre yet with a bouncy toddler), and wanted to see the first one before we went.  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, and fell in love with it!  I love the Dragon Toothless.  He's so cute.  I think the second movie is even better.  It's one of those movies I can watch over-and-over, and it doesn't bother me.  My toddler gets fixated on a movie and I have to watch it 1000 times...moms, you know what I mean.

Our kids age 5 and 8 love it, we watch a a lot of kid movies that are fortune for us to sit through, but this is a great story, greatly told. I think part two is equally as good.",1405555200,,335,4.090909090909091
4038923,5,B002ZG97Z6,"A classic story of an insatiable dragon dictator and increasing taxes and regulatory control.  The rank-and-file dragons must have been initially pleased with the cradle to grave protection and support system devised by the great elite master dragon complete with warm and comfortable housing and plentiful food to be had.  When we join the unfolding saga in the opening scenes of the movie, we see that the regular working dragons are having to collect more and more of other peoples' food to (as we later find out) satisfy the great dictator dragon's demands for satisfaction.  At first, the Scandinavian villagers whom are losing much of their precious livestock to the increasingly frequent raids by the hard- pressed worker dragons, don't understand why they are being robbed over and over again and their very survival is now at stake and face starvation in the winter despite their best efforts at protecting themselves and their livestock from the dragon raids.  The abuse of power by the master dragon finally ends when the worker dragons and the villagers unite and destroy the tyrannical master dragon and live happily ever after.  So happy, in fact, that there is a sequel!  If you listen carefully to all the excellent dialogue written for all the characters, including the entertaining and terrific readings by notable Hollywood actors, the subject of liberty never comes up in conversation per se but they really do seem to all like it a lot in the end.  I guess this movie did not do well at Sundance or Cannes-- or maybe they don't do cartoons.  I guess I don't care or I would google the subject and clarify it now.

This is a wonderful ride of a feature.  Enjoy!",1405468800,,1681,4.825783972125436

The voices of the characters would start talking before the lips of the animated people would start moving. It was difficult watching this and keeping up with who was actually speaking.

So ordered the first movie on Amazon Instant--
he is watching it now for about the 6th time...
we had recorded a version off cable but with commercials--that was too tedious to fast forward through so ordered this one.

4039495,4,B002ZG97Z6,"It's a pretty fun movie, especially how they depicted the dragons.  Anybody who has or had a beloved pet can see how the makers added some of those mannerisms to the dragons.  I also like how it took dedication and effort for the lead character to build a relationship with the dragons and become a dragon rider.  A couple of things which bothered me though were the stereotypical father/son relationship, and how differently the adults were characterized vs. the children - note how all the adults speak with a Scottish(?) accent, but none of the children do.  Almost like the children came from someplace else.  It was a rather unnecessary us vs. them element to the characters.",1403481600,,680,4.777777777777778

4039502,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I watched this with my 9 and 11 yr old daughters.  We all loved it!  I especially appreciate that the hero is an intelligent and well spoken young man who wants to find an alternative to war and killing.  I also loved that there was no ""villian"", per se; just a big misunderstanding between species.  The villians in kid's movies are so unconvincing to me (though my kids often disagree), so having the story hinge on a misunderstanding that simply needs some better communication to get past was excellent in my book. great computer animation; great story; great characters and a great ending!",1403395200,,594,4.737864077669903

4039504,5,B002ZG97Z6,"This  movie deserves a better title. I ignored its theater run because it sounded uninteresting. But, wow! It is really great to see. The story and characterizations are wonderful. The animation goes beyond realistic rendering. Nuances of behavior make Toothless seem very true to life: a pet and a best friend who occasionally seems wiser than his human partner.",1403395200,,363,5.1525423728813555

we're not kids, but love toons and we really enjoyed Dragon.
the viking references were passably accurate, but the old english dialect, while not 'accurate' in this context, was a hoot.
it is funny.

Thus, I was pleased to see that not only could I purchase the first movie with the ability to stream it to all our devices, but that it was at a relatively low price as well.

As far as family movies are concerned, this is a good one.  And because I happen to be a father to 2 boys, it is really nice to see that they have moved on from ""Frozen"" being their favorite movie...  other dad's will understand. :)

It is also nice to have something that I can set the boys down to and be able to have mom and dad time once in a while.

4039683,5,B002ZG97Z6,"DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon may suffer from an odd title, but it certainly grabs your attention. Thankfully, the brilliant animation, characters, and a pleasant variation on the traditional a boy and his dog plot keep that attention.

HTTYD quickly brings you in with its main character, Hiccup, voiced by Jay Baruchel. He is a nerd/outcast archetype, something Baruchel seems to have found himself typecast as, but there is something of a sincerity to his voice and identifiability to his problem of not living up his fathers expectations. These are things that weve all seem before, but they are still welcome here because there is a genuineness to the performances in this film. Hiccup has a great sarcastic sense of humor, and the other teen characters help give the film authenticity, in spite of all the flying fire-breathing reptiles. Theres Astrid (America Ferrera), Snoutlout (Jonah Hill), Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), twins Ruffnut (Kristin Wiig) and Tuffnut (T.J. Miller). The bit of the Appatow gang thats present here lend their improv skills to some the humorous conversations, and it works to the films benefit. Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson also work great as the village chief and Hiccups dad Stoick and blacksmith Gobber respectively.

Where this film really shines, other than the characters, are the visuals. The seas and skies are painted wonderfully. This is especially evident in the scenes where the characters are riding the dragons as mounts. The filmmakers knew that this would be the highpoint in the film, and special care was taken to beautifully and artfully depict the sensation of flight, as well as the creatures agility and speed.

The plot can follow some predictable turns, as the archetype here is a boy and his dog but the twist that keeps this film going the fact this is a pretty cool dog. A dragon. And yes, the little boy in me screams awesome! at riding a dragon. It really is something that simple that drives this film, how awesome it would be to have a dragon as a pet. What propels this film to being great is the seriousness of the conflicts and the identifiable characters. A great one from DreamWorks, whose reputation is slowly approaching Pixar-like proportions.

4039892,4,B002ZG97Z6,"This was a good movie however the sound faded in and out. I had to use the 'closed caption' in order to know what was being spoken. CC took away from the some of the enjoyment of 'How to Train Your Dragon'. Because of sound issues it wasn't worth the price of $14.99, dmorgan...5/19/14",1400457600,,285,4.296296296296297

4039894,5,B002ZG97Z6,"Quite possibly the most perfect movie ever.  The acting is almost flawless... America could have pulled back a little bit.  We get it, strong female, don't over do it.  Wiig is fantastic as is everyone.  The main dragon's behavior and appearance are a mixture of everything we love about cats and dogs and he's is the most endearing pet I've ever seen in a movie.  My one complaint is that the dragons are very undragonlike.  I hope the sequel is just as good.",1400371200,,460,4.481927710843373

4039931,5,B002ZG97Z6,"This is one film that I still regret I never saw in theaters in 3D...the animation is that good.  And the storytelling is a cut above many of their other films, on par with Pixar, in my opinion.  Besides the ""Shrek"" films I'd say this is Dreamworks' best, along with ""Kung Fu Panda"".  Enjoy it for its dazzling animation and aerial sequences, enjoy it for its humor--courtesy of great vocal performances, especially from Jay Baruchel, and enjoy it for a great father-son coming of age story.",1399420800,,491,4.686046511627907

4039969,3,B002ZG97Z6,"Overall great movie! However, there are a few things that really ruined this movie for me. The animation: as far as the dragons and backdrops are concerned is Really well done, however the charectors seem to come of as very half done and at times seem like there not even synced  properly with there voice tracks. I don't know if it was a budget thing or if the studio ran out of time but its blairingly noticeable,  Also Hiccups Voice can be supper annoying and  overly hipitched seeming detached from his character at times. And the fact his dad a Vicking and his Teacher also a Viking have Scottish accents maybe I'm over anylizing but this really ruined the authenticity of this story for me. But overall its a good movie,",1399161600,,726,4.526717557251908

4039973,4,B002ZG97Z6,"Trying to find a movie which covers the age span in our household of 67 to 4 years old  is difficult, to say the least.  We want to find a movie our grandson can watch and we won't be totally bored.  How to Train Your Dragon had a lot of action for him and some humor for me.",1398729600,,275,3.706896551724138
4039974,5,B002ZG97Z6,I really enjoyed this movie. It was full of fun and I think it teaches kids a good lesson..Don't always judge a book by it's cover. I would recommend it to anyone.,1398643200,,163,4.125

One should never lose that aspect of themselves.",1398297600,,267,4.32

4040007,5,B002ZG97Z6,"Even if you're not one for animated movies, this one will capture your heart and leave you feeling bubbly and happy. It's fun for the whole family with just the right mix of playful fantasy and adult complications. It's funny and sweet but also has an important lesson to be learned about judging others. It also touches upon family communication and how important it is to believe and trust each other.",1397433600,,403,4.690140845070423
4040018,2,B002ZG97Z6,"I'm always a little skeptical of recent films that receive near universal praise.  It's almost as if standards are getting lower and what is mediocre is now great and what is actually great is nearly non-existent.  This is a poignant example.

How to Train Your Dragon has an abundance of good reviews so, statistically, you might find yourself in that bucket and be reasonably pleased.  All hype aside, HTTYD is a pretty uninspiring story. You can guess the entire plot within the first few minutes.  Boy is an outcast, boy finds dragon, boy trains dragon, boy saves the day and becomes a hero.  The end.

Now maybe this movie won't break ground in originality, but the execution is pretty poor too.  Nothing exceptional happens.  For anyone who has already seen this movie, I would ask ""What were some memorable lines?"" and ""Who were some memorable characters?"".  The responses, I suspect, would be depressingly lackluster.

I judge a movie by how much you retain after seeing it--whether there was some profound, emotional scene, a clever joke, or an enchanting musical score.  If you don't have any of these things after watching, you know it's a low-scoring movie.",1397347200,3,1169,4.908163265306122

Hiccup is an excellently realized main character with fun side characters. Toothless is worth mentioning in his own sentence. As a dragon, he is a formidable opponent but with Hiccup he's cute, well-written, and fun. The bond they share is truly heart-warming. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go see it!",1397001600,,426,4.693333333333333
4040022,5,B002ZG97Z6,"Jay, a fellow Montrealer, knocked me over with his down-to-earth, slightly goofy character.
The music is solid and energetic - I also listen to that every time I get a chance, although the CD is more (a bit too much) intense compared to the movie - I prefer the actual soundtrack.
The animation is first rate, so are the flight physics and charisma of the creatures in the story.  You can tell that the animators spent a lot of time studying many types of bird flight, and your typical home pet personalities.
Story line is good for adults and kids.",1396915200,,549,4.49
4040023,3,B002ZG97Z6,"I thought the audience was misdirected, themes were adolescent. Purpose of the movie and introduction of each character and dragon was an obvious effort to sell toys. That sort of business bores me. The relationship between the boy and the dragon was flat, the presence of the other slew of adolescent characters (excepting the father and the viking with the missing arm and leg) and their eventual dragons were too brief and flat that the whole thing just fizzled and bored me (and my kids).",1396915200,,492,4.8

4040055,5,B002ZG97Z6,"My whole family loved this movie.  Even my 20-month-old sat still through most of it - nothing keeps her attention for long.  Great themes of forming unlikely friendships, fighting for what you think is right, overcoming disabilities, etc.  A couple things to note, this is not at all the story from the book.  They just borrowed the title and some of the characters and made an entirely different story.  Also, there were some references to the polytheistic Nordic gods.  Just an appropriate nod to the culture of the people they're portraying, but something to be aware of for my Judeo-Christian friends since little ones might question why the characters are referring to gods in the plural or god-characters they might not have ever heard of (Thor, Odin, etc).",1395705600,,764,4.9296875

4040081,4,B002ZG97Z6,"My 5 and a half year old is scared of pretty much everything but he also loves dragon games and dinosaurs so he asked if he could watch this. I did 48 hour rental on AIV and he watched it several times. A few weeks later he asked to rent it again so I decided this time to buy it. The combo pack at 15$ has a dvd he can watch in the car and blu he can watch in the living room.

The movie itself has a fairly wholesome message. Geeky kid wants to fit in, other kids who are more naturally viking make fun of the nerdy kid and when the nerdy kid finally breaks through it's in an unconventional way which while he gets the acclaim of the village it's for the wrong reason and the father who never really connected with his son feels like he can finally relate.

The message about grown ups don't always know best is kind of heavy handed but I didn't mind it overly much. The book is much different from the movie but both are very enjoyable as a family.",1395273600,5,952,4.005263157894737

4040085,4,B002ZG97Z6,"My 3 year old loves dragons...I was worried about him being frightened by the battle at the end but he just said ""o no big bully dragon"" and cheered when everyone was okay. It isn't a before bed movie as he is sensitive to movies as far as action is concerned and gets pretty riled up in them but fun to see his excitement. I do warn about the end for young ones though some kids may be more affected by the fact they blow up the dragon lol we saw it as a big boom of fireworks :)",1395187200,,480,3.8585858585858586

4040138,5,B002ZG97Z6,"This is truly a tour de force of the animation and movie world.  How To Train Your Dragon is simply stupendous, a must-see, and worth every penny you might spend on it.

A young boy named Hiccup doesn't quite fit in with his Viking brethren considering his size, his affinity for clumsiness, and its destructive outcomes.  With a father called Stoic who leads the island home and community, Hiccup is determined to continually prove himself.  This desire manifests itself in the wish to kill a dragon, the pests that steal the food of the Vikings and burn down their village more often than not.  When Hiccup manages to shoot down a Night Fury, the dragon that nobody ever sees and never misses its target, his entire life changes along with his understanding of the creatures that are so very dangerous.

The story is about friendship, trust, beauty, sacrifice, and understanding.  It's so well done that you instantly fall in love with Hiccup's demeanor and the Night Fury, Toothless.  Not only is the story stupendous, but the animation is something to applaud as well.  Smooth, seamless, and perfectly modern.  Along for the ride are the great voice actors, the script, and the score which sends pleasurable chills down my spine every time I hear it.  The entire package couldn't be much better than what it is.",1394323200,,1315,4.8

I figured it would be just another kiddy movie, but Jonah wanted me to watch it with him, so I did and found myself every bit immersed in the story as he was. We paused it 20 minutes in to make some popcorn and came back to it and had such a great time !
I think this is the best animated movie I've ever seen. We watched it twice more that weekend.
My nine year old nephew probably won't remember that weekend but I will.
Great animated movie.
But don't pay for it here on Amazon.

4040372,5,B002ZG97Z6,"The filmmakers have taken the classic ""Villagers Terrorized by Monster(s)"" premise, and given it texture, warmth and humor.  The characters are easy to identify with - not stereotypes, but folks with flaws and strengths as you'd find in any small town.  Hiccup and his cat-like dragon Toothless have a charming bond, easy to identify for many companion animal  owners.  We have watched this movie several times, each time getting caught up in the story.  (Can't say we've done that often for many contemporary movies!)",1389139200,,518,5.119047619047619

4040390,5,B002ZG97Z6,"The movie plot may have nothing in common with the books, but in this case, I'm actually going to say that's OK-- they're both brilliant in different ways. This movie is one of the only ones I've ever seen where the hero is not just compassionate and brave, but *observant*, and *experiments with things*-- which don't always work!-- and *build stuff*. He's a problem-solving engineer, and that's just a wonderful example to have in such a fun adventure. Add to that the excellent supporting character of Astrid, who is very much *not* your stereotypical animated-movie girl (tough, competent, a fighter, observant enough to actually notice when things are weird, and open-minded enough to change her mind so not going for the dumb fighter-girl stereotype either) and this is one of the few kids' movies I wouldn't hesitate to give my younger relatives. On top of that, it's a fun story as suitable for adults as kids, with an *adorable* and very personable dragon and tremendously beautiful graphics. Well done-- I'm looking forward to the sequel.",1388620800,,1048,4.994285714285715

The movie is about Vikings who have to protect themselves from various types of dragons that attack them so, as you can imagine, there is some violence.

My 4 year old was able to follow the story, the Dragons are not too scary and it all works out in the end...but not too quickly as is my concern with many children's movies...not enough focus on the resolution of the conflict.

The animation was high quality, emotive and cartoony enough to avoid the uncanny valley.  I could go off on some inconsistencies in the narrative and places where disbelief had to be suspended just a few notches higher, but it is a fairy tale. Fairy tales do not need rigor, they need setting, characters, and just a hint of a moral.  As such, this was a good entertainment.",1376438400,,493,4.455555555555556

Whether it's the wonderful animation or the compelling story you enjoy, you'll find yourself rooting for the adorable Hiccup and his dragon Toothless.  I loved this movie so much, I actually found myself shedding a few tears at Hiccup's and his father (Stoick ""The Vast"") and the way the skinny boy was constantly misunderstood by his disappointed, and much larger, father.

4040655,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I love this movie.  I didn't expect to, but the interaction between the main character and the dragon is so heart-warming.  I even bought a copy for my mom since she likes animated movies too.

This movie is great because it works through a lot of character development and relationship growth.  The main character learns to overcome his fears and that, by being himself, he can be a success - even if he does things a little differently than everyone else.  And his father, who initially is embarrassed by him, comes to see and value his son for who he really is.  Some pretty deep character development for an animated movie - which is awesome (too many animated films have a flat story and no character development).

Your kid will learn some great lessons, but they won't even realize that they are (because the movie is so much fun to watch).
It's funny too.  Something that will appeal to both kids and parents.",1370390400,,917,4.58282208588957

A couple of years later, and I'm still happily watching with a smile on my face.  The storyline is appealing and tugs at the heart, but not too much so that you don't feel forcibly manipulated.  The humor is appropriate and appreciated.  Aesthetics-wise, it's not as refined or pretty as other animated shows.  At times, it comes across as rather amateur compared to Pixar (the creature animation looks cheap), but that does not take way from my love of this movie.",1370044800,,595,4.412844036697248

Pretty typical ""boy and his dog"" kind of story, but the visuals are just completely breathtaking, this is the first movie with a flying scene where Ib really felt like I was flying, even without the 3-D!

4040724,5,B002ZG97Z6,"Movies that target the ""coming of age"" of a young boy help point us to something that is largely missing in our American culture - a distinctive action that ceremonializes and confirms a boys passage into the responsibilities of manhood.

This movie has a great educational arc in that you don't always have to follow the crowd to be successful. Some great action sequences and incredible flight visuals with added humor from Hiccup and the rest of the crew make this a family film anyone can enjoy.,1363046400,,419,4.454545454545454
4040895,5,B002ZG97Z6,I want my own Toothless. this movie is a great family film to watch and own.

4040930,5,B002ZG97Z6,"There's nothing I don't like about this animation, from the characters to the drawing to the story. I have the original book, which has very little to do with the story here, and I think I like the movie better.",1360454400,,211,4.3
4040931,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I think the only reason this didn't do better was because it was in competition with Disney/Pixar when it came out but it's an excellent movie. Truly gorgeous textures and details make this look good even now when Brave has come out and made the digital animation of hair a new technology.  The characters are all engaging, all relatable, the parent-child interactions way, way better than Brave, and the dragons are just very cool. It's probably too violent and chaotic for little kids (it opens with a night time battle scene), but for anyone older, it's fun and it's engaging for adults so no one gets bored. And while the lead is a boy, the best warrior in his age group is a girl. The geeky kid who knows all the Dungeons and Dragon stats is as useful and funny as the kids who have courage or mechanical skills and women work and fight alongside men as equals.",1360454400,,866,4.481012658227848

4040933,5,B002ZG97Z6,How to Train your Dragon is another great movie from Dreamworks. It's a really great story of a boy who was able to change the hearts and minds of his own people to make them realize their misunderstanding of the nature of dragons.,1360454400,,231,4.395348837209302

4040945,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I got this movie and watched it with my 10 year-old daughter.  I had heard it was really good and I wanted to bring my girls to see it years ago in the theater but just never got there before it left.  What makes this movie good is the way the main character overcomes his poor reputation and earns his father's respect by being different from all the other Vikings.  What makes this movie great is Toothless, the adorable dragon who joins the main character and helps his accomplish all of the aforementioned success.  The plot is simple but engaging.  The characters are a mixed bag of predictable and likeable.  There is action/violence but nothing horrifying.  It's a good movie for young kids and tween or early teen girls because of the cuteness.  The interaction with the dragons is really entertaining.  I have nothing bad to say about this movie, so it deserves my 5 stars.",1359936000,,882,4.602564102564102

When How to Train Your Dragon came out though, it certainly showed DreamWorks at their best. Why? Because this movie delivery absolutely everything that you would want in an animated family film:

-A worthy plot and story? Check

4041127,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I haven't read the books by the same title, so I can't compare the movie to them, and I also did not see the film in 3-D so I can't address that aspect.

What I can say is that on its own, and in a simple 2D environment, I felt this film was entertaining and inspiring. I think it can be appealing to both adults and children. However, I do have a few questions which I will point out below.

Plot:

The plot is not something new, it's basically a story about overcoming misunderstanding and prejudice, coupled with parents and kids not listening to each other. We've seen that before, treated many different ways. The film tends to lean more to the kid's side of the issue.  Kids are the main audience, so that makes sense.

I won't belabor the plot points or the message the movie makes, it is better to catch them and decide for yourself (especially if you are a parent). Everyone will have a different take on these. Personally, it resonated with me and gave me reason to consider how I interact with those in my world.

Animation/Character Look:

It's not the standard stuff one would expect from Dreamworks, a-la ""Shrek"" and ""Toy Story"".

The CGI characters are exaggerated in their appearance, making them more like a traditional cartoon. This, I think, adds to the fantasy aspect of the film and may be more familiar to the kid audience than the adult one, with a question.

The kids in the movie are pretty much scrawny and look undernourished, yet the adults are so over inflated that they look distorted and in serious need of a diet. Not sure why they chose to differentiate the two groups visually so much. But they do work as characters thanks to the good script and the voice actors, as well as the animators, who do an excellent job.

Another question is that although this is a movie about vikings, the adults speak in a Scottish accent, and the kids (including the hero and heroine) speak like Americans. I have no idea why they chose to do this.

Animals:

The dragons are of course the stars of the film, and here we see creature design unlike anything one might expect.

Toothless, the ""hero dragon"" looks more like a large black cat than a dragon. This of course adds a curious appeal.

Cats are wonderfully mysterious creatures, with hugely expressive eyes and ears. Toothless also has large expressive cat like eyes and ears, and no real horns to speak of.

There is a lot of superstition about black cats (as a cat lover, I find that black cats are some of the most endearing members of the species) and an undertone in this movie may have been to make Toothless so black cat-like to underscore the danger of blindly following superstitious feelings, or of taking things at face value, when the true value lies underneath, as it does with Toothless and his loving heart.

The other dragons are of all shapes and sizes and do not look like anything in traditional Western or Asian dragon art. Sure, they have spikes and horns and some incredibly long teeth. Their body style and sinewy shapes are graceful and elegant as well as fantastic. I found them fascinating, although it took two viewings of the movie to catch the incredible detail the designers and animators  put into them. They remind me of some of the characters in some 1950's educational Disney movies -- the ones about outer space and how life evolved on Earth (I think UPA had something to do with those old cartoons). Nevertheless, I felt as dragons they were very original and in many ways endearing, sometimes in a silly way.

Scenery:

It's just plain beautiful. They did such a good job with the forest scenes and even the interiors of the viking homes. Nice job, a treat for the eyes.

Music:

Very nice and appropriate ""epic/fantasy"" style music that supports the story very well. None of the themes are so large as to be truly memorable, (unlike ""Star Wars"", where so many themes stand out on their own), but it does the job of supporting the action and story very well and quite seamlessly.

Flying Sequences:

If you're going to have flying anything in a movie (let alone dragons) you've got to have great aerobatic flying sequences. This film has them with much of the exciting flavor of a WWII aerial dog fight or a camera set up on a roller coaster. At times the flying is sweeping and acrobatic, at other times, majestic. It's all fantasy of course, so much of the impossible stunts work because the film never tries to suggest anything is reality. This is a fantasy flight of fancy all the way through. Quite a lot of fun.

Emotions:

A good story can tug at the heart strings, but it has to be careful not to overdo it. This approach has been a staple of Disney movies throughout and this film shares that legacy. The difficult relations between Hiccup (the hero) and his father are touching, the exuberance of Hiccup as he flies on the back of Toothless, the touching way Toothless treats Hiccup and many more scenes are very emotional, but not overly so. There is appropriate tension and suspense during the fighting scenes.

Conclusion:

I give this movie 5 stars because it is everything a fantasy adventure is supposed to be, done in fine style. Although it is a 21st century film, it follows the legacy of fine fantasy films from the 1950's and 60's. It's not a blockbuster by any means, neither is it a waste of time.

It's a fun and diverting couple of hours and it may give some members of the audience (adults mostly) pause for thought.

I think it is definitely worth a rental -- for the animation and the story. Can't say if the discs are worth it, or how the 3-D works out however.",1353801600,,5600,4.538767395626243

Third, the voice acting is fantastic. Jay Baruchel plays Hiccup the main character, and America Ferrera plays the love interest Astrid. Forth and final reason why this movie is fantastic, amazing, and brilliant is that the visuals are amazing. The animation looks nothing like you have seen before. You can see every little freckle on Hiccups face, even a scar or two. Most people would think of How to Train Your Dragon as a kids movie. Well I don't think so and so does Dreamworks. Dreamworks has said many times it is not intended to be a kids movie more of a teen and adult flick. You will notice if you ask a kid about the movie he saw and does not remember it. Why, because they seen so many other movies that are more kid like that this one slips their mind. Most of the fans are teens and adults, but that doesn't mean a kid would not like it, just that teens and adults will appreciate it more. This movie deserves a 6 out of 5, but Amazon won't let me give it that rating. I say rent it and see if you like. If you have a 3D TV watch in 3D because the 3D also looks fantastic.",1353024000,,1438,4.2327272727272724

HOW TO TAME YOUR DRAGON---the son of a Viking chief is a misfit, living in a village harassed by dragons. The son, who is an inventor of sorts, brings down a dragon with a catapult, then befriends said dragon. Boy saves village.

PARANORMAN---the son of a fat man is able to see and speak with dead people. Other live people cannot do so, so they think that he's nuts. He lives in a Salem-style village where a witch was hanged centuries ago. The witch comes back to destroy village. Dead people give the boy clues to stop her. Boy saves village.

CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS---the son of a shopkeeper is an inventor whose inventions cause havoc. He invents a machine that turns rain into any kind of food. The village becomes famous. Unscrupulous mayor wrecks machine, which goes totally out of control and starts to destroy village. Boy saves village.

CHICKEN LITTLE---the son of a rooster causes an alarm in the village because he thinks that the sky is falling when a metallic object falls from the sky. He is ridiculed for the panic.

I realize we all can learn things from each other, but can't someone make one that shows the parents can teach the children things too.(Sidebar over) The characters and voices used are perfect for their respective roles.

4041200,5,B002ZG97Z6,"Dreamworks' HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is an excellent movie -- I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie, and I went in with moderately high anticipation.  The movie is about a Nordic village that is constantly under attack by dragons and the one unlikely hero that discovers a way to save it.  Here are three (hopefully solid) reasons why I would recommend this movie to everyone:

1)  It's great for both adults and children.
It's hard to do right, but HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON uses a great blend of entertainment for all ages.  This movie will appeal to adults -- there's plenty of higher-brow comedy that doesn't rely on simple slapstick pratfalls.  For kids (even the youngest of them), there's plenty of nice slapstick comedy and jokes that don't rely on much language (thanks to the speechless dragons).  And really, who doesn't think dragons are at least a little bit cool?

2)  The visuals are stunning.
Unfortunately, this movie misses out with the absence of IMAX or 3D cinema.  There are some seriously spectacular visuals in HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON -- some of the flight scenes are top-notch.  Don't be fooled by the cartoony character designs -- the animation here is done really well.  There are a few scenes towards the ending that I would rate among my favorite 3D-Animated/CG shots.  Like most movies though, the biggest screen you can get, the better.

3)  The story is a lot of fun.
As a jaded and cynical adult, I found myself rooting for the good guys, booing the bad guys, and grinning through the flight scenes.  The movie is pretty light-hearted, and while it does tread some familiar ground, its personality is enough to hide any of these narrative cliches.  The main characters, Hiccup is very likeable, and the dragon Toothless is downright adorable.

I saw HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON via Amazon's Instant Video and there were no defective points at all.  It worked flawlessly -- no stutters in framerate compared to the animation.  I would recommend this movie to most people that I know -- there's not much here to not like aside from the title.  Good for parents, kids, teens, etc... If you enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CLOUDY-WITH-A-CHANCE-OF-MEATBALLS/dp/B00304E5NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS</a>, this will be right up your alley.

For some reason, it got ""hung-up"" while streaming (took all night), so we weren't able to watch it on the night we'd planned.  We called Amazon.com, and while they couldn't do anything about the streaming speed, they did issue a credit, and told us they would allow us to re-stream it for free if we were unable to watch it within the 24 hr period once we did start to watch it.  They were very responsive, and despite our disappointment at being unable to watch the movie on the night in question, we felt they handled the situation well.

As for the movie itself, we absolutely loved it!  It has broad-ranging appeal; it's enjoyable for both kids and adults.  We are looking forward to the sequel (in the works apparently)!!!",1340582400,,811,4.52054794520548

How to Train Your Dragon is a great family movie and it came recommended to me by several friends that don't even have kids. Now, I've seen some animated features (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredibles/dp/B004I654UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredibles</a>) that could potentially make my all time list of favorite movies, but I'd have to think hard about any animated movie that would make it into my top 20 of all time. And of my top 20 favorite movies half would likely only get 4 versus 5 stars. Dragon would land on a separate list somewhere only in about the middle of the pack of just my favorite ""animated"" movies. It's a good movie...but classic? Nah.

Against his father's will, the timid Hiccup sneaks out with a new weapon he designed. Turns out the weapon works pretty well and he brings down the most feared dragon in the land with it. The weapon doesn't kill the beast, and as the title of the movie might suggest, Hiccup instead forms a friendship with the monster that could change human/dragon relations forever.

I was thoroughly entertained. My wife thought it was okay. My kids...they liked it. No one was wowed. Perhaps I've spoiled my family with my liberal stance of letting them watch pretty much anything they want (within reason). Or maybe we've all just overdosed on reruns of the early&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SpongeBob-Episodes/dp/B002DYJTVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SpongeBob Episodes</a>&nbsp;on DVD.

However, he was brilliant, and he learned to use his brains and his heart instead of his (non-existent)brawn, proving to everyone that the dragons were not their enemies-- but could be their best allies and friends. The voice actors on this did an amazing job--- and the animation was just brilliant, and the writing came across like a classic novel.

4041227,5,B002ZG97Z6,"How To Train Your Dragon is most definitely one of the biggest sleeper hits in recent memory. While the film got great reviews from critics, audiences never really paid it much mind, forgetting it quickly in exchange for more ""toddler"" oriented animated movies, such as Tangled, Rio, or 3D remade family classics such as The Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast. 'Dragon' being a PG animated film tailors towards older kids, but will be just as adored by adults for its epic action and deep and heartfelt characters. So no, this is a not a film made for 3 and 4 year old toddlers who just wanna go and see a cute animals make funny faces. Some dragons can be a bit scary for them, not to also mention the fiery action, so I'd recommend this for at least 6 years and up.
The story takes place during the Viking era and stars Hiccup, a small and skinny Viking son of a much bigger, manlier, and grander dragon-slaying father. Hiccup must compete with other kids his age in order to train to be dragon killers, yet this is the classic story of a kid who simply feels different from the others, and figures out a truth about the dragons that no one else knows - that they can live in a good peaceful coexistence. Hiccup stumbles upon a dragon himself, trains with him and soon learns many life lessons using his brain instead of his brawn in order to humble the dragons, in the hopes of proving all the others wrong.

The best thing about 'Dragon' is its attention to the characters - there is much time taken to build up the relationship between Hiccup and his black sheep dragon named Toothless. Lots of quiet moments are granted to us making this a very unique film about characters and how relationships grow despite cultural obstacles, really making this a parallel on society in a strange way. This is way different than the usual loud and obnoxious animated family films that rely way too much on impressing the audience with crazy special effects instead of giving them a good story. 'Dragon' does have much action and great effects on its own, but what makes this film work is that the effects are used to guide the story, not tell it. Hence, we get a great character story ALONG WITH all the great epic action to accompany it. 2 for 1, can't go wrong with it. 'Dragon' does not disappoint in all regards; it's definitely apparent the filmmakers put lots of effort into a well-told story as well as good special effects and animation. Moreover, we must understand that this story is not anything we haven't already seen before in a different setting, but the simplicity of the story and its reliance on character actions instead of constant monologues and dialogues granted by movies that simply talk too much and do very little.
Some people may be disappointed that the comedy aspect of this film isn't at the forefront. This is more of an action/adventure with some comedic elements simply SPRINKLED upon the film, but the movie is not made to be a comedy. The beauty here is that the story is so good, it doesn't ever matter to the viewer. You'll be too busy ""whoah'ing to ever care to chuckle a cheap 'haha.' So no, 'Dragon' won't pull out any dumb and overused pop culture trendy lines in order to be loved by the latest Entertainment Weekly subscriber a la Shrek, nor will you find any sort of product placement nonsense. The filmmakers are here to give you an epic adventure, and on honing in on this goal it is then done incredibly well, you won't really care about anything else. The story may be simple, but since it's told so fantastically, you appreciate it anyhow.
This all leads up to an epic dragon battle finale which contains some of the best special effects editing and shot in recent animated film history, and I would have to say on a personal note that seeing action this intense and well directed is not something you'll probably find in any other family film out there. So if you're tired of just being fed little kiddie stories about cute animals walking around in colorful little worlds, check out 'Dragon' for some more intense action that dares to walk on a slightly grittier terrain. With a story full of dragons, Vikings and epic longships, you will not be disappointed.

On a technical side, and this is a pretty big point and one of the main reasons that make the Blu-ray copy of this film so appealing. That the film, in a nutshell, looks ABSOLUTELY IMMACULATE. The detail found on this Blu-ray transfer is simply stunning and jaw-droppingly GORGEOUS to any fan of High Definition video. Landscapes are clean and fully detailed, edges are sharp, colors are extravagant, smoke and light are eye-poppingly smooth, motion is flawless. Out of my collection of 130 Blu-ray titles, this would have to be on my top three in terms of visual detail, perhaps tying first place with Tron:Legacy, another epically gorgeous-looking film. I simply cannot say enough good things about how incredibly perfect the video detail looks on this blu-ray, and is way ahead of the visuals I saw in the movie theaters for this film.
Now to make matters even better, the film also contains one of the crispest, cleanest, most flawless audio soundtracks I've ever heard. The film runs on the latest TrueHD Dolby sound, and it is well noticed (even though other soundtracks that run on the same system don't sound nearly as good). Every sound is not only audible, from the voices to wind and fire battles, but every single sound is even, smooth and incredibly clean. The music in the film itself ever even borders on overtaking the film, and while the soundtrack score to the movie is great, the general volume level of it is kept at a respectable distance, guiding the film's entire feel, giving the viewer an almost subconscious trip into the world of the Vikings because it never boasts saying ""hey, listen to me, i sound really good at the expense of the voices and other things."" No, the soundtrack knows its place, as well as all the other sounds; nothing is ever too loud or too low, but there's other way to say it - it's juuuuust right. So just as the video is one of the absolute best I've ever seen, the audio soundtrack is one of the absolute best I've ever heard. It amazes me just how much work was put into making this blu-ray transfer this good.
In closing, in terms of blu-ray performance, I believe 'Dragon' should be playing on all retail store tv displays, if only to show the absolute maximum capacity of every television unit they are selling. Yup, it looks THAT good. My hat goes off to the transfer team to showing us exactly what the power of blu-ray can do. Hence a great story, great characters, and stunning presentation make this an easy pick for any movie fan.",1326672000,,6698,4.590150250417362
4041228,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I think most people were skeptical about this film when it came out because it hadn't been advertised very well and the title doesn't exactly strike a person as appealing. I wasn't at all interested in this film when it came out until some trusted associates began telling me how much they enjoyed the film. My curiosity was peaked and I rented the film and watched it with somewhat low expectations.
The story is about a group of rising vikings that are being trained on how to kill a dragon. When scraggly, odd Hiccup manages to injure a dragon outside of school, he finds that he is unable to kill it as taught. He instead becomes determined to help the dragon recover and fly once more.
This was a very good movie, and I'm not saying that because I had low expectations. DreamWorks seems to be a real hit-or-miss company with their animated films and this was the best one I've seen since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Panda/dp/B0051XQI84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Panda</a>. The story was a lot more interesting than expected and the blend of humor and action was very well played. The characters were likable and had believable personalities and development, and that goes for the dragons as well. The animation style was a bit different and I heard some people say that it was too much of a video-game look to be enjoyed, but there were still some stunning visuals in the film and some very creative moments. The voice acting was very well done and the musical score for the film was amazing! You can't go wrong with John Powell; that guy is an amazing composer.
Overall, the movie was a perfect mix of fun and comedy and should not be missed, whether you like the visual style or not.

But this movie is one of my favorite as well as my husband's! There are some little added gems that you can notice, like that they made the main character left-handed.

The relationships in the movie are just priceless, especially between Hiccup and Toothless. Dragons have always been portrayed as massive meanies, and to find out they are actually ""friendly"" was just awesome.

Loved it!  It was among one of the better animated movies I had seen around that time, other than like Toy Story 3, and later Rango and Kung Fu Panda 2.  I bought this up on Blu-Ray right when it came out and have watched it several times since.  If you're at all into animated movies, this is definitely one to watch.  It's overall pretty good for kids, though there are a couple of parts that might be scary.  I'd say it's good for maybe ages 5+.  In any case though, this is a must see animated movie!

4041248,5,B002ZG97Z6,"It's easy to say that the average person usually knows how to train dogs, cats, parrots, etc. Professional trainers and entertainers train lions, elephants, hawks, dolphins, etc.

Who would have thought that a toothpick-thin boy, who lacks both physical strength and athlete-like coordination, would be able to train one of the most vicious dragons through care, understanding, and friendship?

How to Train Your Dragon had to be one of the most lowly-anticipated movies of 2010. It was a so-called ""Sleeper Hit"" that provided satisfaction to children, teens, and adults. Like many others have said, the trailers did not do the movie any justice.

This movie ranks right up there with Toy Story and Ratatouille.

This Blu-ray set comes with two discs - a Blu-ray disc with the main and special features - and a DVD copy. There isn't a great number of special features, but it is adequate considering the stunning visual and audio qualities. Even the soundtrack is really good.

And OMG, I thought that it was the most adorable movie ever. Through these 2 hours I've grown to feel for the Toothless and fell in love with this cure dragon. Separate thing to mention that the face expressions of the dragon are something else. Without saying a word you can read his thoughts and emotions. My favorite part was when he was offering the boy his half of fish to eat. But really really wanted to eat it himself.... I am pretty sure I had a huge smile on my face too.

The best news, however, is the second disc which not only contains another movie, it has numerous activities that are truly fun and worthwhile for anyone with a computer and a color printer. Lots of ""arts amd crafts"" but also short cartoons about ""Viking"" olympics and a ""test"" you can take to determine what type of Viking you would be. This test is surprisingly accurate collating the answers and choosing one of the Viking characters as well as assigning you a Viking name.

If you can stomach the first 15-20 minutes of the movie with the main character's awful nasally voice it does get much better.  After that you are in for a great movie.

4041334,5,B002ZG97Z6,"Ordered this BD movie here at amazon, was on sale and so I thought what the heck. I have seen bits and pieces of this movie from a bootleg copy to a DVD and an HD sampler showing at the displays at Sears. Didn't think it would ever be of my liking, was I ever wrong. Read the reviews at high end blu-ray sites and this is one of the best movies to showcase your home theater, (and so they say). Boy they are right! Pop this baby this morning on my PS3 and kick the sound through my Bose system. Wow! nothing short of spectacular. This movie, right to the part where Astrid was riding on the back of Toothless hugging Hiccup when she said ""It's AMAZING"". Well, this movie is freaking Amazing!; could be the best of the bunch. I recently bought Incredibles, Megamind, Cars, Kung-Fu Panda, Monsters vs. Aliens, etc..- all on blu-ray! None of them comes close to this movie. From the storyline to the jaw-dropping special effects to the sound, it all comes to play. Like I said, the video quality is the best. Heck it's probably the best movie I've seen on my 63"" Samsung Plasma (real movie and animated). Dreamworks outdid themselves this time on visuals; Unbelievable details. You can see every fiber on the clothing as if they were real. The characters seems like they are almost popping out of the screen but not to the point where it looks surreal. A great family film not just for kids but adults as well. The storyline will have you weeping. The special effects will have you in awe, from the characters to the high flying mystical and magical dragons. You will be thinking about this movie even after you've seen it. Trust me, I'm in the process of collecting blu-ray for my home theater. So far, this is the best both in visuals, sound, and storyline.  Popping it again tonight for round 2.

P.S. - I know some audiophiles out there may be thinking or bashing Bose systems. I personally like my Lifestyle 12. Served me well for over 12 years and it still kicking. Friends are still amazed at how much those little speakers sound. Thumping base and crisp mids for the dialogues in movies. I know and heard of better systems and probably need an upgrade but my motto is and always will be - If it's not broken, don't fix it! so there! hope you enjoyed this review and make sure to get the movie mentioned above. You will not regret it! Thanks amazon! =)

Follow-up: Just finished watching the special features. Amazing how the characters from the story came to the big screen. The author who wrote the story is a genius. Watch that part of the special feature, just made me appreciate the movie even more. Very smart, entertaining, and feel-good movie!",1303430400,,2655,4.481404958677686

Awesome animation, great story line, extremely entertaining & suitable for family viewing ... almost. The exception being very, very young children. Albeit this movie is animated & most certainly suitable for children, it contains scenes in which dragons are growling, baring their teeth & attacking children which may frighten the very youngest among us. I enjoyed How To Train Your Dragon immensely & I highly recommend it for family viewing at the PARENTS DISCRETION. Parents know their children. What may frighten one four year old may not frighten another. As we have both a DVD player & a Blu-Ray player, it is nice having this movie available on both DVD & Blu-Ray discs. Most especially in the event either player should break down or eventually become obsolete. Price point is always a consideration. However, Amazon priced this Duo just right. Both the DVD & Blu-Ray Versions are in Widescreen format & of course, both are in Color. The Blu-Ray is 1080p HD in English 5.1 Dolby True HD. Other languages include French, Spanish & Portuguese all of which are in 5.1 Dolby Digital. Subtitles include English, English SDH, French, Spanish & Portuguese. The DVD Version is, as mentioned above, presented in a Widescreen format with the black bars at the top & the bottom of the screen. Languages include English, French & Spanish in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround & English 2.0 Surround. Subtitles are in English, French & Spanish.

In fact at this moment I like it more then any movie in general. The art is fantastic, the story is great, the characters are adorable. It has more depth then any of the other Dreamwork's animations I've seen. However, it is not at all like the book that does not stop it from being a wonderful movie on its own right.

I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age. I love it, my 6 year old nephew loves it his 1 1/2 year old sister loves it, as do many of my friends in college, and my mother!",1300579200,,647,4.015503875968992

The Blu-Ray is very well made. The pictures is crystal clear and does not suffer from too many ""this should be in 3D"" moments. I saw this film in 3D at the theater and honestly the 2D production of this film loses nothing. The sound editing is that went into this movie is also done very well; it is simply amazing. For those who have a higher end audio system are in for a real treat as well since the HD audio track has many extra audio queues that aren't present in the non HD audio track. This movie has as another bonus for anyone who has a dedicated powered sub in their audio system. The bass management in this film is outstanding. I would it even rivals movies like War of the Worlds and The Incredible Hulk.",1300233600,,889,4.174418604651163

I am a huge fan of animated movies and this is one of the best I have seen.  You know you are getting a quality product when you pop in a disc that says either Pixar or DreamWorks.  Not to take away anything from Toy Story 3, but I thought this was better.  Gerard Butler is great, and Jay Baruchel provides the quirky kind-of-off performance that shines through in this epic tail.  Give it a chance, I am sure you will like it.",1299283200,,564,4.081818181818182
4041378,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I thought this movie was great. You get a kid who doesn't fit in but wants to belong in his own way. He's open-minded (or at least creative because he likes to tinker/invent things brought about by apprenticing as a blacksmith) and willing to take chances (risk his life not knowing if he may get dead for his huge curiosity for Toothless). He gets to learn that dragons aren't as bad as he was taught once given a chance. There's also the parent/teenager awkwardness which has it's funny moments. The traditional beliefs vs. trying a different path. I like Hiccup's sarcasm and witty remarks... just says what he's thinking which gets him in trouble.

There are some things I'd like to point out as a reply to what some 1 star reviewers said...

1. I've never read this movie as it's book form first. As it seems to go for most book-turned-movie. They are almost always different because of changes. Just accept it and stop comparing the book version vs. the movie version. In fact, it always does seem better to watch the movie first... enjoy it for what it is then go read the book and it makes reading the book version infinitely better because then it becomes more in depth. IMO... movies always are condensed versions of the book unless you want a 6 hour movie or a trilogy. And imo again, in condensing the movie, in order to make things make sense and skip explanations of many things, the story gets changed along the way.

2. Another 1 star poster said that in the end of the movie... what happened to Hiccup's leg was too graphic. Really?! I don't recall seeing blood and gore and a mangled leg... What about the blacksmith Gobber? He's missing an arm and a leg... was that graphic? What about Gobber telling the story of how it happened... wouldn't that be more graphic? Rhetorical question. I feel sad for Hiccup that it happened to him but I believe it was written in the story to show how that makes the bond between the boy and his dragon stronger... you may not realize it at first but when they walk away from the ""camera"" towards the door... that's when it really hits you... Hiccup... Toothless...

3. Emo hair? Uh no... Just a plain haircut...

4. The dragons were not cute puppies... Actually IMO, they were... or at least Toothless was more like Stitch mixed with a cat. He had Stitch's curiosity, occasional similar body movement and personality without being gross. (And I do love Stitch too. He was hilarious.) Toothless moves like a stalking cat. I felt that way halfway into the movie. I only even got the inclination to watch the movie after a glimpse of the movie during the Oscars. And the funny thing is... I didn't find out that the codirectors and cowriters, Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois (who made Lilo & Stitch) had anything to do with the movie until today. I guess their style was just that evident in Toothless.",1299196800,,2851,4.560546875

4041380,5,B002ZG97Z6,"As an earlier reviewer said, I wouldn't recommend this movie for younger children.  We have a 4 year old who loves Shrek and Over the Hedge.  We let him watch part of this movie, but it was quickly apparent that the material was a little too intense for him.

If you are considering this movie with the thought that a child under the age of 7 might watch it, I would reconsider.

Don't get me wrong, this IS a fantastic movie.  You should still buy it, but save it for your older kids (and yourself!).",1298592000,4,501,4.231578947368421
4041381,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I took my youngun' to see this movie when it was still in the theater. BEST idea EVER! This movie struck me so, that we then went to the bookstore & bought the first half of the books written by Patricia Cornwell that the movie was loosely based off of. Now, the movie was remarkaby good, but...the book series...well, I will just say that the movie doesn't quite follow in the exact same fashion...for instace - in the book, Toothless is QUITE a different sort of dragon, but not in a bad way..really, he is quite a silly little ""untrained"" scrap o' nuttin in the book, but..makes for quite lively stories!
My ""take"" on the movie, is that it will get you ""tingling"" and emotional in a zillion different places inside of you, but, when the movie is over, &, you are just begging for more, - don't hesitate to head straight to your local bookstore to get the REST of the 'JOURNEY'...we did ourselves, &, have been grateful ever since.",1298505600,2,933,4.461988304093567

4041410,5,B002ZG97Z6,"In my opinion this is pretty much the ultimate animated film on both a technical level and as a great presentation of a good story. The quality of the technical aspects of the work is WAY ahead of any animated feature I've seen. The water scenes are so real visually it is hard to register in one's mind they aren't actually IN, UNDER OR ON water. The texture of the clothing, hair, skin on the people characters is amazing as is the skin and scales of the dragons. The story is essentially a father/son relationship tale with ""coming of age"" scenario of a young man trying to communicate his character and worth to a father who is locked in a mindset of his son being inept and more of a village liability than an asset. Throw in the angst of adolescence with its issues of peer acceptance and a seasoning of boy/girl stress/awakenings and the result is a good tale relatable to a broad spectrum of ages.",1297036800,2,905,4.425149700598802

My kids wanted to see it at the theater, and I reluctantly assented. Within the first two seconds of the movie, I was laughing harder than I'd laughed in a movie theater in ages. The originality of the characters and situations (from a Viking king named Stoic the Vast to a crusty warrior named Gobber with the voice of the always hilarious Craig Ferguson) was refreshingly unique from the film's first frame. The action moves quickly as Hiccup, Stoic's misfit son, tries comically to fit in. The adventure story is satisfying to kids and parents alike with a heart-warming theme that everyone can relate to: a child desperate to earn a parent's love. We got the dvd when it first came out, and we all loved it just as much the second time around. My husband agreed that the movie was much better than he'd expected.

Like any animation movie - there was a message in the movie and a happy ending. Dreamworks did a great job with the plot and its characters. I could easily recognize the deep voice of one of the Vikings - Gerard Butler. Losers became heros and the ""dangerous"" dragons turned into adorable pets. What more could I ask. ;) Overall a fun movie and would recommend to watch. The quality of the movie was great on my TV.

4041445,3,B002ZG97Z6,"Who knew that Jay Baruchel sounds exactly like Christian Slater? I mean my wife and I we're shocked when the credits rolled and saw that the lead voice of Hiccup was played by Jay, um, uh, Barawho and not Slater. Anyway....

How to Train Your Dragon is a great family movie and it came recommended to me by several friends that don't even have kids. Now, I've seen some animated features (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredibles/dp/B004I654UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredibles</a>) that could potentially make my all time list of favorite movies, but I'd have to think hard about any animated movie that would make it into my top 20 of all time. And of my top 20 favorite movies half would likely only get 4 versus 5 stars. Dragon would land on a separate list somewhere only in about the middle of the pack of just my favorite ""animated"" movies. It's a good movie...but classic? Nah.

Against his father's will, the timid Hiccup sneaks out with a new weapon he designed. Turns out the weapon works pretty well and he brings down the most feared dragon in the land with it. The weapon doesn't kill the beast, and as the title of the movie might suggest, Hiccup instead forms a friendship with the monster that could change human/dragon relations forever.

I was thoroughly entertained. My wife thought it was okay. My kids...they liked it. No one was wowed. Perhaps I've spoiled my family with my liberal stance of letting them watch pretty much anything they want (within reason). Or maybe we've all just overdosed on reruns of the early&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SpongeBob-Episodes/dp/B002DYJTVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SpongeBob Episodes</a>&nbsp;on DVD. Cuz, I'll tell ya what, if you said to me that Nick is running a marathon of the first 50 SpongeBob episodes or Cartoon Network is premiering How to Train Your Dragon, I'd been tuning into Nick.

4041448,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I saw this movie in the theater with a few friends, we're all college aged adults, so that says a lot about the draw factor of this movie. It's got plenty of action and adventure, but also a lot of heart! I think a lot of people can relate to Hiccup (main character) trying to fit in, having family issues with a militaristic father who's gone a lot, finding his own special talent, and standing up for himself when he has to. I loved the end of the movie when Hiccup has a life changing event, no spoilers, but it gives a shout out to a lot of people out there who are marginilized, or not often thought of. We never get to see characters like this in movies, it's so refreshing to see. Toothless, the dragon, is absolutely adorable, too!",1294876800,,739,4.24822695035461
4041449,4,B002ZG97Z6,"I wasn't very engrossed by the first twenty minutes or so, but then it seemed to really gel and I loved the rest. The animation is typically fine Dreamworks stuff, though I wish I'd seen this in 3D in theaters, as many shots are clearly set up to highlight those effects, and while they look fine in 2D, it's clear that we're missing another semi-dimension. But that's no big deal, as the film is in general quite winning.

The voice work is all good, with Gerard Butler the most convincing. I really liked Toothless' look, and the highlight of the film is the boy-and-his-dragon aspect; it's always kind of funny when animation makes you tear up a bit. But anyone who's ever really loved an animal friend knows how that goes.

The blu-ray transfer is quite good, though not quite as amazingly crisp as Up or Kung Fu Panda. There are a few extras, a brief doc on the voices, but it's not an especially great BD package, merely decent.

All in all, a very good-looking, heartfelt movie, one of the best animated films of 2010 that I've seen.",1294704000,,1040,4.492063492063492

I'm now over twenty but I have quite a few cousins under 12 so I bought this after seeing the dvd version of the film my aunt had gotten. Great moral dilemmas, good character development, great plot, and stunning visuals make this movie one of my new favorites. All of my cousins love this movie and not surprising so so their parents. It's truly going to become a new family classic, at least in my family.",1294444800,,515,4.16
4041462,5,B002ZG97Z6,"This is has become my favorite movie of all time. There's something about the connection between the main character 'Hiccup' and the dragon 'Toothless' that surpasses all other ""buddy films"" in recent memory. The depth of the story almost makes it a drama, but my emotions while watching this film ran the gamut. The animation, of course, is beautiful. If you did get to see it in the theater in 3-D, then you got a treat. One of the few movies using 3-D appropriately. But, nothing is lost watching a ""non 3-D"" version. Part of the magic that makes this a 5-star film is the soundtrack/score. Seriously well done.",1294444800,,614,4.6422018348623855

Loved it in the movie theater. Still a great movie in 2D at home.
Just wish I didn't have to buy all the different discs. At this point I just want the blu-ray. Then again, would be a good movie to play for kids in the den where there's only a DVD player, and no blu-ray. Price was good anyway and really worth it.

It teaches some great concepts about learning and how to fit in even with your differences.  It has some great humor in it and is well told.  The rating is set right on this movie.

I love that the studios have combined the blu-ray with the DVD packs.  The blu-ray looks great in the home theater but having the DVD as well allows us to travel in the car with the DVD player that we won't soon be swaping out for the blu-ray.  Good call!",1294185600,,554,4.074074074074074

It's a great and very realistic story about relationships and finding out who we are created to be, taking risks for what we believe in, and going after it with everything you've got.  They did a great job telling the story.  You connect with all the characters, definitely Hiccup.  And you definitely connect with the relationship with Hiccup and Toothless.  You are rooting for them from the beginning.  The animation is stunning, some of the best I've seen.  The collaboration with Cinematographer Roger Deakins really paid off.  The movie looks amazing.  They take you through the gamut of emotions from joy and laughter to dread to tears and back again.  I highly recommend this movie.  It has taken a place among my top 10 movies, alongside ""The Matrix"" and ""Lord of the Rings (Trilogy)"".  It's at least worth the rental, even if you don't decide to own it.",1294012800,3,1014,4.5054945054945055

Great story and fantastic visuals and sound.  As an adult with 3 kids I watched this from start to finish never leaving my chair.  The kids wanted to watch it a second time but I made them wait until the next day.  This is simple no problem recommndation.  At $18.99 w/free S&H and no tax it is a must.

From that point on I knew we had to get it for Christmas. It teaches a lot of good lessons and even has been recommended by Parents Magazine as one of the videos that teach good moral lessons that kids should watch. Yes it does deal with Vikings & Dragon Killing for part of it but it's all to teach a good lesson...it doesn't have any unnecessary violence and it's animated so no blood and guts etc. Great movie we've recommended to several of our friends & definitely plan on recommending to more,1293753600,2,637,4.316666666666666

4041473,5,B002ZG97Z6,"First of all I consider myself a loyalist to the Walt Disney Company. I've had a year pass to Disneyland for a while. I even worked for the studio for a bit. However, this is the first time I've felt like DreamWorks Animation was acting as competition for Disney/Pixar.

How to Train Your Dragon is a great film. It doesn't include the usual fart and bathroom humor jokes that are usually found in the DreamWorks movies. There is actual conflict, you like the characters because it's a heartfelt movie. There is a drama, comedy and beautiful landscapes. The characters are likable without being over the top obnoxious. I once heard that Pixar films are for the child in every adult and that DreamWorks films are for the adult in every child. That mostly reverenced the irreverent humor that kids didn't quite understand, but liked to repeat. I think this film changes the game for DreamWorks Animation. Bravo to DreamWorks!

As far as the Blu-Ray goes, it gets straight to the point. There are not a lot of things that force you to watch for 5 straight minutes (Shrek 2 DVD anyone?) before you can get to the feature presentation. It's easy to navigate and the compression on the film is beautiful. There are some good special features, but I haven't spent a lot of time watching them because we've been watching the film over and over again.

Amazing animation, great voice acting, fun story and some real creativity make this movie a gem.  Wife and I have watched it 3 or 4 times already and will certainly watch it many more times over the years.

Only disappointing thing about this specific item is that it doesn't include a digital copy.  Not a big deal because digital copies aren't even close to being as cool as they should be, but its come to be expected.

4041478,5,B002ZG97Z6,"Simply out, this movie is amazing for 3 reasons.

1. It's a movie about people taming Dragons in a friendly way to be able to ride them.

2. The bond that develops between Hiccup and Toothless is so realistic, it seems like that is the right way to start a friendship with a dragon.

3. The thing that really sets this movie apart from other children's epics (movie with large adventure feel and action suitable for kids) is that there are actually high stakes for the two main characters in this movie. And they both suffer in a way that won't scare kids but also that adults will be able to recognize.

The voice acting is superb, the action scenes are amazing, the scenery and environments are GORGEOUS, and the music is not just fitting for the movie, but grandiose in its execution.

Get this movie. Right now. If you have a blu-ray player of some sort, get on blu ray. It's jaw dropping.",1293494400,3,893,4.420731707317073

Craig Ferguson was actually really good in this, and the short film that is included features Ferguson as the main focus, it's really funny and a wonderful extra to an already pitch perfect film. You don't just have to be a kid to enjoy this one. The last 15 minutes is as action packed as any live action feature. The movie is a lot of fun, looking forward to more in the series.",1293321600,,530,4.257425742574258
4041494,5,B002ZG97Z6,"There is something special about this film, and I have a hard time putting my finger on it when describing it to my friends.  The high-quality picture and sound that Blu-Ray delivers, the fantastic voice acting, well-timed comedy, and the surprisingly emotional score all bring this movie to the top of the list.  But there is something else at work here, something that must be seen to be truly understood.

I'm not sure if one has to have a pet (which I do) to appreciate this, but the bond between Toothless and Hiccup as the story progresses is powerful.  I'm a guy and a few parts of the movie really hit me hard.  The last 15 minutes of the movie contain some of the most emotional storytelling I've seen in a movie.  You'd have to be one of the coldest people on earth to not feel something during those scenes.

The CGI is incredible.  Facial expressions, especially the expression in Toothless's eyes, look so lifelike that it's made this one of my featured Blu-Ray movies when I want to show off my Hi-Def setup.  For a fun comparison of how lifelike the graphics are, watch the ""Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon"" extra feature.  It jumps between a traditional cartoon and CGI.  When it goes back to the CGI, it's funny how real it will look.

Not only is this a great Blu-Ray title, it's one of the best animated films ever created.  I highly recommend it.",1293321600,5,1367,4.508130081300813

Probably the best use of 3D I have seen at a theater as well.  It looks FANTASTIC on blu-ray.  This is the only studio that is close to the quality of Pixar presently.  If Toy Story 3 hadn't been released this year, there is no question this film would win for best animated film at Oscar time.  In fact, it may give TS3 a run for its money.  It's that good.  This is also a great film to showcase your home theater system.  Not only does it look fantastic, it sounds fantastic as well.

I bought it because it seemed like all the special features had been included in the ""Boneknapper"" DVD and so I figured I had to buy the extra disc to get them. Not true. The ""Boneknapper"" DVD has a few short ""features"", most of which are games and print-outs. There are a few ""Deleted Scenes"" but most of the dialogue was included in the movie already. These scenes are more like earlier/alternate scenes that do not add much insight into the movie. Not what I was looking for. The ""All-New Dragon Adventure"" is cute, but only about 13 minutes long - not worth spending an extra 7 or 8 dollars to get it.

I came downstairs this morning and wondered why it didn't look very good to what I had seen.  I realized that the kids put the DVD version instead of the Blu-ray one.  The DVD is nice but the blu-ray is fantastic the audio is great.  My wife even made the comment ""This is the first time I feel like wee need a bigger TV.""  Of course I was secretly smiling at this.  We currently have a 58"" Samsung plasma(Also ordered from amazon earlier this year) .  I also liked this movie a lot and was better than I imagined.  now about that bigger TV?",1292025600,,855,4.090361445783133

4041545,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I had hesitations about this movie, so we decided to rent it first. We have never watched a movie back to back so many times, it was that good. I'm sure we played it at least 8 times in the first three days we had it. The humor is quick and on many levels. I worried that it would be too scary for my 4 and 5 yr old (girls), but they only got worried right at the beginning. Each time we watched it, we'd find new humor and still laugh at the old. Actually laugh. Right out loud. I'm sending it back today - every one is sad, but it will give us a break and I'll order this one for Christmas.",1291248000,6,592,3.821138211382114
4041546,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I fell madly in love with this movie the first time my sister-in-law insisted I see it.  As a person who has read Cressida Cowell's series, I will be the first to admit this has not a single thing to do with its source book, but wow, this is an animated movie of heart among animated movies.  It's wonderfully simple while still boasting plenty of emotion. It's funny.  It's snappy.  The animation and music are gorgeous.  And hey, who doesn't love dragons?

The story is of a Viking boy named Hiccup who is the worst Viking of his tribe. He's shrimpy, too smart-alecky for his own good, and he happens to be the over-protected son of the chief.  The tribe has been waging a centuries-old war with the dragons who prey on the same food suppy, so Hiccup believes that if he kills a dragon he will finally earn some respect.  So he invents a machine to shoot down a dragon, accomplishes the conceptual goal, and sets about killing it.  Only he is unable to.  Instead, he winds up making a pet out of the dragon he names Toothless.

This movie is, by all definitions, adorable.  The kids will love the cute dragons, the teen set will love the hint of teen romance and all the action, and as an adult I was intrigued by both the relationships in the movie as well as the pure movie-making art.  Truly, there is something for everyone.

The blu-ray/dvd is standard and suitable blu-ray/dvd entertainment, though it seemed most of the good stuff was added to the blu-ray, leaving the dvd itself with very little.  Still, we get the commentary (I love commentary), a pop-up fact track (lots of fun), deleted scenes (always interesting) as well as a fun little Viking personality quiz.  Not to mention the short movie, which I found quite enjoyable.  Nothing terribly special, but certainly worthy.

Still, the reason to buy anything is the movie itself.  It's enchanting.",1291161600,7,1864,4.6109422492401215

The animated water looks so real, as if the drawings were placed on photographs. Not only am I very pleased with the quality of the movie, but this blu-ray disc is confirmation that I'll never go back to standard definition.

The characters are lovable, fun and quirky. The storyline is pure Dreamworks storytelling and the graphics are phenomenal.

I really like the unassuming lead characters that Dreamworks has been creating. They are very likable and hiccup is a true sweetheart (even though he is a viking!).

This is one that I don't mind watching over again and again because the flying scenes in particular are spectacular.

This set, with the blu-ray and DVD are perfect for us because we have a blu-ray player but we also have portable DVD players for travel.

Kids will love it, and there is plenty for adults to enjoy as well. Saw it in the theater in IMAX and just watched it for the first time at home in HD on the home theater. Both experiences were excellent, but completely different. In IMAX, you are so immersed in  movie, with things going on all around you, that you can miss how beautifully animated this film is. If you are like me, and saw it previously in 3D, then watch it again for the first time. Highly recommend this movie.",1290816000,3,597,4.378378378378378

4041558,5,B002ZG97Z6,"This movie is wonderful! For my daughter who loves Dragons, it will probably make kids think that Dragons are not as bad as they look. Most of the movies of Dragons are more related to horrible beasts that like to attack each other and participate in huge wars, if you're expecting that kind of thing, this movie is not for you. Is wonderful to see a movie in which you can see Dragons as wonderful and noble creatures they really are.
Also, the animation is amazing! We're Disney fans and this is the only Dreamworks movie we have, it really is on equal quality or more than any Pixar one you have seen, but he story is what makes is so different from other Dreamworks movies.
After watching this movie 3 times on the theater, my daughter started reading all the books, and she is almost done with all of Hiccup's misadventures that we also recommend. The story on the books is different but all of them have the same thing as the movie: adventure, imagination, and a good lesson on how to be a great Hero, the hard way :)
Most probably our opinions are similar to those of most of the people that liked this movie, but if you get it, it will not disappoint any kid at home (and some adults either), is adventurous, imaginative, exciting, lovely and simply THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!

4041584,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I first heard about this film from my coworkers with kids, who were really surprised at how much they liked the movie when they took their kids. I ended up seeing it because my sister, who works in child care, tries to watch all the popular kids movies so she knows what the kids are talking about when they talk about them. She rented the dvd one evening and, since I was pretty bored, I started watching it.

The introduction had me hooked (growing up in Wisconsin, Hiccup's description of the Island of Burke sounded like ""Home Sweet Home""), and, five minutes in, I knew I loved the movie. That was before we even saw Toothless.

The story (mild spoilers) follows Hiccup, a young, nerdy Viking as he proves himself to his fellow Vikings -- and the Dragons. The outline of the story really sounds like it could be just about any other teen story out there, but this movie stands heads-and-shoulders above the rest for a combination of reasons. First of all, the characters are great. Hiccup is not just your average annoying, whiny teen-goof-who-must-prove-himself (or, worse, an annoying, whiny teen-nongoof-who-fancies-him/herself-a-goof-who-must-prove-him/herself, ala Bella from Twilight). Instead of whining or denying his shortcomings, he tries to combat them. Ok, so he can't lift heavy hammers or pop off a dragon's head with his hands...but he eagerly runs into battle with his ""cannon"" to shoot what he can't. No one believes that he took down a dragon; does he throw a temper tantrum or sulk for hours? No, he tries to find the dragon and bring back proof. He's harder on himself than he should be (like, considering himself a coward because he won't kill a defenseless, bound animal), but he's judging himself by his community's standards; and he acknowledges his shortcomings and tries to figure out how to go on despite them. A character that could have come out very cliche, but didn't.
Toothless is...hilarious! The animators * had * to know animals, because they made the actions and expressions of this dragon so believable it's uncanny! He had a very likable ""personality"" (Dragon-ality?), and was a perfect ""pet"". The scenes where Hiccup and Toothless get to know each other are incredible...there was so much potential for this to end up cheesy or otherwise to go wrong, but it was all great stuff. Toothless is my favorite character in the whole movie, but I love Hiccup too (followed by the twins).
Astrid, Rough and Tough, Fishlegs, Snotlout (?), Stoic, Gobber, etc. were also fantastic. They all had their own personalities -- and, again, so much potential to go wrong if done wrong...but were instead great -- and part to play in the story.
The voice acting was superb. Hiccup's voice was outrageously good...the twins were absolutely convincing nerds and troublemakers...Astrid was strong but not obnoxious...etc., etc. The voice actors really were crucial here...any of the lines that are hilarious in this film could have been awful if the wrong voice actor attempted them.
The animation was great as well. Watching the final fight scene, I found myself thinking, ""Wow, that would be an EPIC battle to witness."" And the animators got ""body language"" down quite well...like the ""now we finally have something to talk about"" scene. You could feel Stoic's anticipation for the good stories his boy would share.

Another thing I loved about this movie was that, despite the fact that the story was, in essence, a ""lesson"" story (the Vikings and dragons had misunderstood one another, and ended up ""BFF""; the nerdy kid ended up a hero -- and disabled as well [a nice tribute, I think, particularly when we have wounded veterans coming home every day]), it wasn't ""preachy"" at all. So, kids could take good lessons from the story, but it wasn't a ""teaching"" movie.
And, as an adult, I loved it. It's one of the best movies to come out in a long time, IMHO. I don't have kids, but I bought this movie anyway. :P",1290297600,,3935,4.8614008941877795
4041585,4,B002ZG97Z6,"For me, this was by far the best of the 3-D animated films to reach the big screen this year.  Not much is lost in the hi-def 2-D version now available. There are sweeping vistas, believable characters and a majestic sense of flying with the dragons.

The story is simple. Hiccup, a young Viking, defies tradition by befriending a deadly foe, a ferocious dragon he calls Toothless.  Together they must fight tradition and find a way to save both their worlds.

Superbly designed in all aspects -- the characters, the world and the story come together to create a wondrously entertaining diversion for all ages.  I don't say that loosely.",1290297600,,637,4.754545454545455

Of course my 11-year-old who has read all of Ms. Cowell's books points out the many differences in the movie, but even he loved this delightful film adaptation.

This is definitely true for How to Train your Dragon.

The bonus short movie was just as interesting as the main movie although much shorter than the full movie.

Somehow we heard that Wal-Mart had t-shirts, at the time, but by the time we got there, we were able to only get one of the last ones.  It seems that for as little as this movie gets advertised, it still has some hard-core fans.
The Boneknapper video is pretty good, but fairly short (15-min (?)). We haven't had time to go through all of the features, but have been pleased thus far.

One disappointing thing was that Amazon was not able to pre-ship the DVD before the release.  The release was on a Friday, so while we could have just gone down to Meijer and bought the movie for the weekend, my son had to wait until the following week because I had pre-purchased the movie for his birthday in September.

HOWEVER.  This is the double disc version. The 2 pack.  Where you think you're getting another movie for free.  Another dragon movie.  NOT.

I just tried to play the extra feature and put the disk in my dvd player. Nothing happened.  Then I waited. And waited. Then I hit ""menu."" Finally I hit the right button I guess, and a menu popped up.

Nothing was highlited and I couldn't scroll through the options. I never got it to play. And the think almost broke my dvd player. After getting the disk out- it was just acting too funky- it wouldn't turn back on.

Finally after I unplugged everything and plugged it back in, I was able to get my dvd player to work again.

Let me say, I am not pleased.  If you read the fine print on the 2nd disk you will find out that it is 16 minutes long. Um, seriously?  16 minutes.  That's not even a whole little kids episode on TV.  WTF?!

And if you have a mac, forget about it. It states that it is Microsoft only.  again, WTF?!?

In conclusion, I'm very disappointed in this.  I'm going to take my copy back to target and try to get a refund.  we'll see how that goes.

4041675,5,B002ZG97Z6,"How to Train Your Dragon is an amazing story about a young boy learning more about dragons, and finding out dragons can be allies and not enemies.

The vikings, dragons, storyline, and art are amazing due to a lot of hard work. The Dreamworks Animated Studios did a perfect job with this movie and putting it together like a sculpture full of beauty. My favorite character is Toothless. Toothless is a lovable and storng dragon who reminds me of a Pokemon and Stitch from ""Lilo and Stitch"". Toothless was also cute and he is one of my favorite movie animals of all time (even if he is a 3D character).

One of my favorite scenes in this movie is where Hiccup comes back for Toothless and both characters draw on the ground. After Hiccup draws Toothless on the ground, Toothless the dragon ended up creating his own drawing (which is in the form of a neat scribble). Before Toothless honors Hiccup with trust, Hiccup was able to dance around Toothless' drawing without stepping on the lines (which would cause Hiccup to get himself harmed if he did it more than three times). This scene was truly original and creative, and I made me tear and feel joyful.

My other favorite scenes involve Toothless flying in the air with Hiccup and Astrid during the afternoon, and Toothless takes on a mean, gigantic dragon near the movie's end.

This movie is a treat for all who like dragons and this is by far Dreamwork Animated Studios' best movie yet. A++

4041676,5,B002ZG97Z6,This is a fabulous movie.  Great for both kids and adults.  Humerous and sweet at the same time.  Picture Quality for Blu Ray?  Amazing,1288483200,,135,4.5
4041677,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I've already written a review of this movie for my university's paper. The Blu-Ray/DVD version is exceptional and the quality is top notch. The movie is essentially unchanged, so here is that review:

""As an SU student, I think it would suffice to say that I don't get out much. That could have been why I was initially skeptical when my sister recommended to me the PG-rated ""How to Train Your Dragon."" I should have never doubted her. As a reviewer, I could simply join the ranks of countless other movie critiques across the nation and compare HTTYD to ""Avatar"" or nitpick its uninspired plot, but I am of the impression that would be a bore to you and me both. Instead, I'll be approaching this movie from what I am - a 90s-kid college student. So that we're on the same page, allow me to lay down some context. The young, unlikely hero Hiccup lives on the Viking island of Berk. The village's life is dominated dragon warfare. However, after accidentally capturing his own dragon, Hiccup rescinds from old traditions and attempts to convince his tribe that everything they know about dragons is wrong.

""The most striking aspect of this movie was the dragons. The movie introduces several ""species"" of dragon, but the star of the show is Hiccup's Night Fury, affectionately named Toothless. Where to start? For starters, I am an Animal Behavior student and found Hiccup's willingness to watch and record behavior before making inferences pretty incredible. In addition, I am a herpetologist, which is to say that I study amphibians and reptiles. The Night Fury species had an interesting body design that was fun to look at, but the most interesting anatomical bit were the flaps on the sides of its head (reminding me of the axolotls, a type of salamander). The suspension of disbelief was so subtle in this movie, I often found myself wondering how the behaviors of the several species would be different in the presence or absence of this or that (common thoughts for my scientific discipline, but only for real things!).

""If one were to suppose dragons could fly, one could also believe that their flight would allow for insanely cool 3D flying sequences. I'm not a huge fan of effects-films, but HTTYD threw in just enough of the computer magic to maintain an immersive and exciting story. The Real D 3D technology being pushed into so many theaters was subtle enough to not be gimmick-y (an event I have been awaiting for so very long). I could be biased, what with my ocular handicap, but the 3D glasses were comfortable enough to wear that I almost forgot I was wearing them as the credits rolled. To complement this great animation the characters, though characature-ish, are on screen for long enough to maintain established and believable personalities. The soundtrack is pretty good, considering we aren't talking about a musical. Memorable songs include ""Forbidden Friendship"" and ""Sticks & Stones,"" a song by Icelandic lead singer of Sigur R&oacute;s, J&oacute;nsi.

""Halfway through production of HTTYD, Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois (the co-directors and writers of Disney's ""Lilo & Stitch"") took over as co-directors. I couldn't imagine the movie with any other direction. If you grew up when I did, you saw and loved ""Lilo & Stitch,"" and for many of the same reasons, you would love HTTYD. The characters Lilo and Toothless are almost totally replaceable - even their facial structure and expressions are similar. Although DreamWorks Animation has typically been regarded as releasing films that just don't match the Pixar standard, HTTYD makes a fierce game-breaker. It really is that good.""",1288483200,,3617,4.93431855500821

4041679,5,B002ZG97Z6,"DreamWorks Animation delivers another wholehearted dose of top-quality entertainment with the fun-filled animated adventure ""How to Train Your Dragon"". In the small island of Berk, a scrawny but inventive teenage Viking named Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) hopes of earning the respect of his father (Gerard Butler) and the rest of the village by slaying his first dragon, but when he stumbles upon a frightened and injured beast, he can't bring himself to kill it. Hiccup defies centuries of tradition by befriending the dragon he calls Toothless and learns that he must convince his village the errors of their ways. ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is an interesting and utterly charming family spectacle from the creators of ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"". Though the story is pretty straightforward, the animated film is a heartfelt mix of adventure and comedy. The characters are amusing and well developed. The computer animation is certainly stunning.

We saw this movie multiple times as a family in the theater (never in 3D, because that's just not that important to us) and tonight's viewing was on Amazon's VOD in HD on my Sony Bravia. What a *fantastic* experience (better than the theater!) and the movie is simply one of the best movies our family has seen in a number of years. Incredible story, exciting, funny - and absolutely beautiful. Oh, and the music was perfect. Sweeping, melodic and memorable.

Probably the biggest compliment I could pay this movie was the fact that in no way was it ""dumbed down"" or formulaic for a family movie. Too many movies of late are too predictable with their obligatory stupid jokes insults. This movie was above that. It was surprising and creative - with a very witty and well-thought-out script.

My only complaint is that the trailer for this movie (at least the one we saw when it was being advertised for the theaters) didn't do it justice. So we didn't initially jump to see it. But we've more than made up for it with the multiple viewings since.

Kudos to Amazon for making this available in HD and in *fantastic* quality.

4041698,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I have to say that when a Dreamworks Animation film is released my hopes aren't high. From my point of view, they aim mostly for cheap laughs with mediocre stories. However, sometimes they do hit the right string and deliver a throughfully entertaining film with great visuals, characters and story. So far, from the 20-plus films that Dreamworks had released since its foundation, I found only five worth seeing and owning (Shrek, Shrek 2, Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit and Kung Fu Panda). When I walked to a Dreamworks film I never have high hopes like when I enter a Pixar film (all of which are excellent). This year was not the exception and when I saw trailers for How to Train Your Dragon, I never got too much excited about it. All I have to say is that I couldn't be more wrong!!

For the first time, I feel that Dreamworks did a film that can be up there with the Pixar catalogue. I haven't seen such a great film produced by Dreamworks since the first Shrek was released. This movie is an instant classic!!

Instead of aiming for sitcom-esque jokes like most of his films, HTTYD has what all Pixar films have: a wide appeal. This film can be enjoyed by every member of the family and has a good quality humor and most important of all, a heart (a thing that is usually missing from Dreamworks). Add breathtaking visuals, a magnificent score, action, great characters and you have one of the most compelling animated films of all time. I still think Pixar is better and in fact I think Toy Story 3 is better than this one but without a doubt with HTTYD, Dreamworks make a huge step formward and became closer to Pixar (a step that may have gone backwards again with the fourth and hopefully last Shrek). Do I have more confidence in Dreamworks films? Not really, we'll have to see how Megamind and future films stand. But even if is the beginning of a new era for Dreamworks or an isolated success, HTTYD is a masterpiece.

The Blu-Ray transfer is gorgoeus. You can see every detail in the screen, absolutely magnificent. The 5.1 dolby true HD is equally impressive. The are many nice bonus features (including a new short). Most of them are short but they are fun to watch nontheless.

The DVD provided here also looks great for SD but is no match for the BD quality.

How To Train Your Dragon is an excellent film that is completely recommended (even if you don have kids like myself). Congratulations to Dreamworks for showing us that when they want to, they can do great things.

On the other hand, this is still a fantastic movie.  The art is amazing.  I hated the dragons until about halfway through, I just didn't like the funky shapes.  But, they really grew on me and I began to notice all the subtleties of their expressions.

This movie is FUNNY.  I'm 38 and I laughed out loud several times.  My son, probably too young for it, wasn't too interested until the end and then he was cheering with me and my wife.

Dreamworks really does some fantastic stuff and this is one of their best.",1287878400,2,679,4.491803278688525
4041726,5,B002ZG97Z6,"The viking genre is a perennial one in Hollywood, with about one major release per year.  Previous releases include Beowulf, Pathfinder, The 13th Warrior among others.  All these previous movies shared one result; bad reviews.  Now Dreamworks takes a stab at the genre with an animated comedy, and scores one of the biggest hits of 2010; How to Train Your Dragon.  Unlike Shrek, Over the Hedge, Antz and Dreamwork's previous animated films, this one focuses primarily on human characters and their relationships, with only one key non-human involved, the dragon Toothless.  And interestingly, Toothless does not talk, which is rare in animated films.  Yet the combination works out.  The movie is funny, the storyline is extremely original, and the characters have depth and create empathy among the audience.  Most of the comedy is either slapstick action comedy involving the dragons, or humorous dialogue between the viking characters; all of which is appropriate for even the youngest children.

I consider this one of the best movies of 2010.  This would have been the best animated film of 2010 if Toy Story 3 was not around.  But since both films came out this year, we might see 2 animated nominations for the Best Picture at the Academy Awards come February.  Both the Blu-Ray and regular DVD come with an additional short film featuring most of the main, human characters from the main movie.  This short film is quite entertaining, though it is pure comedy and lacks some of the heart of the feature film.  There are no additional scenes in the movie, just the standard features that come with a DVD, such as interviews with cast members, and a history of the effort it took to go from book to film.  Overall, worth the time to watch it, and the money to buy this set.",1287792000,,1779,4.8250825082508255
4041727,5,B002ZG97Z6,"How to Train Your Dragon is great for the whole family.  As with other great stories, every age group will get something different from it.  The story itself is very touching, but it also lends itself to teachable moments.  Each one of us has a ""dragon"" that we need to train.",1287705600,,276,4.372549019607843
4041728,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I watched the movie about four times in theater, and I loved seeing it every time (and I'm just a poor college student!). The characters, the soundtrack, the animation... It just does everything right and is officially my favorite 3D film. I'm sure there are several reviews that will go into great detail about its greatness, so let me talk a bit about the actual product.

One of the biggest things going for HTTYD is the quality of animation. So, if you thought seeing it in 3d on the big screen looked amazing, getting in Blu-ray is the next best thing (if not equal). They move extremely smooth, the detail of hair and texture of clothing is extremely realistic, yet all the cartoon-styled facial expressions and movement are captured with comical grace. Believe me, there were several scenes where I would honestly have thought they were shot from real life.

The extras in this DVD are fulfilling for both adults and children. For the children, it ranges from viking quizzes, a juke box, and even a 'How to Draw Your Dragon' segment! Meanwhile, the film commentary, detailed behind-the-scenes sections, deleted scenes, and cast interview is definitely interesting for the older range audience. Most of all, there is the short film 'Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon' which is a very light hearted and hilarious animated extra, taking place sometime after the movie. It had me literally laughing out loud several times (Frozen vikings, anyone?). It includes 2d animated parts, which I'm sure many miss having around ever since most kids movies nowadays are 3D/CG'd in some way.

In the end, it really is just worth it. About $20 for top-notch quality and an exclusive extra film for a movie I love to death-- why not?",1287705600,2,1722,4.850340136054422
4041729,5,B002ZG97Z6,"This is an actual review of the product. I saw the film at the theatre, and bought the disk on the strength of the 3D cinema version. I should add that I've seen EVERY 3D movie as I'm actively involved in developing 3D solutions. A few comments on the film first.

This is one of the best 3D films currently produced. Where others disappoint or add nothing to the viewer's experience, the 3D in this film is used to great effect. Flying sequences do bring out the best in 3D it seems! To-date the only 3D film to rival this one is Avatar (of course). In general animation lends itself to 3D because the creative opportunities are greater. Also, live action Directors seem to have a problem leveraging 3D at present. We need a new generation of Directors, better cameras and processing, and better screenplay before we see 3D achieve its true potential.

But enough of that. At least 17% of the public can't see 3D so lets get to the 2D BluRay disk. First, the 2D disk seems noticeably longer than the 3D version I watched. I don't have figures on this, but the flying sequences seem longer. Maybe not, but subjectively it felt that way. In any case, I enjoyed the second viewing almost as much as the first. This is one of those rare disks that merits many plays. Of course humor and action lend themselves to repeat plays, but what distinguishes this film is the attention to detail and the endearing characters. I won't bother repeating the positive reviews which abound for this film. Just enough to say I adore the dragons, the people... everything about this film is good or great.

The extra material is a bit of a let down. The deleted scenes are storyboards for the most part; I was hoping for some genuine animation. Trawling through the rest of the material, there is a BD-Live connection which was momentarily interesting. It is clear the studios need to work at understanding what the internet savvy user finds entertaining. So overall I was underwhelmed by the extra material - it was worth watching once.

Overall I'd have to say this is a disk I don't regret buying (I subscribe to Netflix) because I know it will get watched time and time again. As an adult this film really works; I would be tempted to say that adults are the primary, target audience. It is that rich an experience. Anyhow, I'm a sucker for films with dragons.

4041750,5,B002ZG97Z6,"""How To Train Your Dragon"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: A Viking teenager named Hiccup lives on the island of Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life. The teen's smarts and offbeat sense of humor don't sit too well with his tribe or its chief... who just happens to be Hiccup's father. However, when Hiccup is included in Dragon Training with the other Viking teens, he sees his chance to prove he has what it takes to be a fighter. But when he encounters (and ultimately befriends) an injured dragon, his world is flipped upside down, and what started out as Hiccup's one shot to prove himself turns into an opportunity to set a new course for the future of the entire tribe.

The voice cast led by Jay Baruchel (as Hiccup) & Gerard Butler (as Stoick) is excellent! The directing by Chris Sanders (he also did the stories to ""Beauty And The Beast"" (1991), ""Aladdin"" (1992) & ""The Lion King"" (1994, also did the production design) & Dean DeBlois (both of them also wrote & directed ""Lilo & Stitch"" (2002) is brilliant! The screenplay (based on the novel by Cressida Cowell) by Sanders, DeBlois & William Davies (who also did the story & screenplay to ""Twins"" (1988) & the screenplay to ""Flushed Away"" (2006) is brilliant!

The music by John Powell (who also did the music, recently to ""Green Zone"" (2010), ""Knight & Day"" (2010) & the upcoming ""Fair Game"" (2010), he also doing the music to the upcoming ""Rio"" (2011) is brilliant! The film editing by Maryann Brandon (who also did the film editing to ""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006), ""Star Trek"" (2009), the upcoming ""Gulliver's Travels"" (2010) & ""Super 8"" (2011) & Darren T. Holmes (who also did the film editing to ""The Iron Giant"" (1999), ""Lilo & Stitch"" & ""Ratatouille"" (2007) is excellent! The production design by Kathy Altieri (who also did the production design to ""Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron"" (2002), ""Over The Hedge"" (2006), she also did the art direction to ""The Prince Of Egypt"" (1998) is brilliant! The art direction by Pierre-Olivier Vincent (who also did the art direction to ""Flushed Away"") is brilliant!

This is a fun and entertaining animated film that keeps you entertained and amazed. This is a well-made and well-crafted film that is different and interesting than most animated films out there. This is one of the best efforts for Dreamworks, outside of the Shrek movies, ever. This is also one of the best films of the year.",1287273600,2,2423,4.723404255319149
4041751,5,B002ZG97Z6,"...because I want one! How to Train your Dragon is an awesome movie for kids and adults alike. Not only is it visually amazing, the cast is fantastic(Jay Baruchel as Hiccup, Gerard Butler as Stoick, Jonah Hill as Snotlout, Craig Ferguson as Gobber, and America Ferrara as Astrid). But awesome cast aside, in this movie, even the dragons had personality!

The story is simple. Hiccup, a scrawny Viking boy who can't seem to fit in, unknowingly shoots down and injures a feared Night Fury dragon. The dragon has lost part of his tail wing, and can't fly. However the compassionate Hiccup can't bring himself to kill it. Instead Hiccup befriends the dragon, naming him Toothless, and invents a contraption that allows Toothless to finally fly free. Hiccup's friendship with Toothless helps him to view dragons and his world differently, and to challenge everything that he's been taught.

How to Train Your Dragon is a heartwarming story of trust and friendship, and carving new paths for yourself even when you've been trained to follow old ones. There are lots of laughs and great dialogue, and I have to admit there were one or two emotional moments too. Great film for grown-ups and kids. I saw it in 3D in IMAX, and I bought the DVD which I watched again yesterday. It was just as good as I remembered. My kids loved it too. You can't go wrong with this one.",1287273600,3,1360,4.686192468619247
4041772,5,B002ZG97Z6,"Vikings are by all accounts burly, hairy, looming, and fierce, and that's probably just the womenfolk. Hiccup, the movie's sometime narrator, isn't your average tough and brawly Viking. Hiccup happens to be a hapless, noodly-figured, often scorned Viking teenager, and that his father is the intimidating village chief is maybe the sole reason why he isn't kicked more to the curb. Hiccup spends most of his days trying to prove himself to the warrior community. He only keeps on embarrassing himself. He's often relegated to the smithy, indoors and safe as the blacksmith's lowly apprentice.

Hiccup's village sits on a desolate island, and it's a bleak living, made even more arduous by frequent encroachments of ravaging, fire-breathing dragons. Hundreds of years have seen these battle-craving Vikings hunting down these dragons, and Hiccup is expected to step into this manly habit. Except that Hiccup, an outsider and more introspective than most, will sort of accidentally topsy turvy that age-old tradition. But that's only if he makes it thru dragon slaying school. And if he survives his efforts to befriend the elusive Night Fury dragon.

DreamWorks Animation still lags behind Pixar, but HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON goes a ways in garnering street cred for DreamWorks. It's real easy to get behind the story, its themes and philosophies, and the likable central character. The best things - or, rather, my favorite bits - about this film all have to do with Hiccup hanging out with his dragon and incidentally picking up invaluable insights in dealing with dragons. Toothless the Night Fury dragon is awesome and wonderfully expressive. Whenever Toothless springs into action, the film pulses with an exhilarating sense of adventure. These moments are when we're reminded that Toothless may be adorable but he's still very much a formidable presence. The message of tolerance and open-mindedness is naturally integrated into the story, so thankfully this doesn't at all feel like one of those very special Blossom episodes.

The animation is really excellent, with the CG artists opting for more playful, more exaggerated renditions of the human characters and the dragons. The most realistically rendered elements turn out to be the atmospheric land-, sea-, and skyscapes. The dragon flights in this film are as breathtaking as those we saw in AVATAR. It makes me wish I'd seen this in 3D. I don't know why these Vikings have burry Scottish accents, but it does give us a chance to listen to the always funny Craig Ferguson (Gobber), so it's all good. Gerard Butler, who plays Hiccup's bullish father, channels his roaring persona from 300.

So I've got the 2-DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation and the following bonus stuff:

- Audio commentary with Filmmakers Chris Sanders, Dean DeBlois, and Bonnie Arnold

- ""Viking-Sized Cast"" has interviews with the voice actors (00:11:44 minutes long)

- ""The Technical Artistry of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON"" - a focus on the film's state-of-the-art CG technology (00:10:13)

- ""Get Your Game On"" previews the HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON and KUNG FU PANDA WORLD video games

- Trailers to SHREK FOREVER AFTER, THE PENGUINS OF MADAGASCAR, THE LAST AIRBENDER, and the upcoming MEGAMIND

- The trailer to and a Behind the Scenes segment on SHREK THE MUSICAL

The second DVD offers the fun animated short, LEGEND OF THE BONEKNAPPER DRAGON. It runs at around 16 minutes long. Taking place some time after the events in the film, this one tells of how the blacksmith Gobber, Hiccup and his young Viking friends embark on a quest across the icy seas for the mythical Boneknapper dragon. But they end up stranded on a barren rock formation. This short also features moments of old school 2D animation (whenever Gobber is flashing back to one of his rather far-fetched stories). My biggest beef with this short: Toothless is barely in this one.

Bonus material for this second DVD:

- 3 Deleted Scenes from the feature film, done in rough storyboard sketches, with intros from Director/Co-Writer Dean DeBlois (total running time: 00:07:34 minutes)

- ""The Story Behind the Story"" presents an interview with HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON author Cressida Cowell (00:07:40 minutes)

- """"Racing for the Gold"" is a fun, quick, animated peek into four categories within the Viking Winter Games (bobsledding, speed skating, ski jumping, and snowboarding) and also the medal ceremony for that greatest of Viking sports, Dragon Training (the top medal is made out of ham)

- Animator Gabe Hordos instructs on ""How to Draw Toothless"" (00:10:57)

- ""Take the Viking Personality Test"" - Take a multiple-choice survey to learn which of the characters in the film you're most like

- ""DreamWorks Animation Video Jukebox"" allows you to click on songs from previous DreamWorks animated flicks: ""I'm a Believer"" (SHREK), ""I Like To Move It, Move It"" (MADAGASCAR), ""Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting"" (KUNG FU PANDA), ""Rockin' the Suburbs"" (OVER THE HEDGE), and ""Here Comes the Sun"" (BEE MOVIE)

- ""Dragon Activity Center"" - Insert this DVD into your PC and access the following DVD-ROM activities: ""Build Your Own Dragons"" (construct a life-size Toothless, a 3D Gronckle, a 3D Terrible Terror, and a 3D Night Fury) and ""Viking Zone"" (a peek at Viking Accessories, Viking & Dragon Masks, Flashlight Patterns, Growth Chart, Coloring Pages, and Stickers)",1287187200,40,5374,5.093287827076223
4041773,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I loved this film and saw it 4 times in the theater. I also love the soundtrack from this movie and it's my favorite since the infamous soundtrack from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragonheart/dp/B000002P1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragonheart</a>&nbsp;(this link is for the cassette since the cd link oddly has no audio samples to listen to). My mom loved the HTTYD soundtrack when she heard me listening to it (particularly ""Forbidden Friendship"" and ""Romantic Flight""). So I was super excited to watch this movie with her last night. However, I was heartbroken when she declared afterwards that the only thing she liked about the movie was the music. She even said ""Toothless"" the dragon was downright ""evil looking"". Me (and everyone else in my family) thought he was simply adorable. She said she hated the vikings in the movie to and couldn't care about any of them. Apparently she thought/hoped this was going to be a movie set in modern times and some kid would just find a dragon out in the woods one day. She said this film did not even come close to dethroning ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monsters Inc."" as her favorite family cartoon movies. So I guess I can't say it's a guarantee that everyone will love this (even though before last night, I would have definitely believed that).

Anyway, there are enough reviews on this fantastic movie to go around explaining how great it is. However, I will say that the bonus ""Legend Of The Boneknapper Dragon"" dvd was nothing I would miss if I hadn't gotten it for only $1 extra. The film makers know ""Toothless"" was the main draw to this franchise, so they decided to almost entirely leave him out of this (roughly) 13 minute short film. I am assuming they don't want people to get worn out on ""Toothless"" before the HTTYD sequel in 2013. He is on screen only about 5 seconds, which is far too short in my opinion. Really, the only reason to see this short film is to see what the ""Boneknapper"" dragon looks like. Apart from that, don't be afraid that you are missing much, because you are not. Still, if you're a collector like I am, it doesn't hurt to have it since it's only an extra buck (which is really all it is worth).",1287187200,2,2221,4.81413612565445
4041774,5,B002ZG97Z6,"I very rarely review a movie ---for anyone. This one is an exception. I saw ""How to Train Your Dragon"" in 3D in the theaters. I was very impressed. A simple story yet carried out with eaceptional grace. There were no bumps, no long drawn out sub plots, just a story about a lonely boy and his dreams.

The animation was beyond superb. Dreamworks has captured CGI with all the aplomb that once belonged solely to ILM. This is why I bought Blu-Ray. It captures the art so well. Audio supports the story line and never overwhelms it.

For those adults who don't like ""cartoons"", this isn't one. Try it out. You'll be very pleasantly surprised.",1287187200,7,640,4.508620689655173
4041775,4,B002ZG97Z6,"I am really surprised that HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON did not do better in the theatres.  My husband, 13 and 5 year old daughters, and I selected this movie for family movie night a few weeks ago, and we all liked it very much.  HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is a sweet, adorable movie, beautifully rendered, with a kind-hearted messages.

DreamWorks really did a nice job with HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON.  In HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, we meet Hiccup, the son of a Viking chief.  Hiccup is, well, different that the other Viking kids; he is skinny, smart, and not particularly interesting in killing things.  Unfortunately, their village is constantly under attack by dragons, and all children must learn to become dragon hunters.  Hiccup does try to kill dragons, but he always fails, often times making things worse for his village.  Finally, through a stroke of pure luck, Hiccup manages to bring down a dreaded Night Fury dragon; but, of course, no one sees it happen.  Not even his father believes his story.  Tenderhearted Hiccup cannot bring himself to kill the dragon, who he names Toothless.  Instead the two bond and form a fast friendship, Hiccup learns how to tame dragons without killing them, and in the end, saves his village and his people from an even worse threat.

The plot of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is story we have all heard before, countless times, but, quite frankly, we didn't care at all.  The animation is gorgeous, the voice actors are quite talented, and the tale is very charmingly told.  My 5 year old loved it (and wants repeated viewings), the 13 year old declared it okay (which at this age is EXTREMELY high praise), and my husband and I enjoyed ourselves.  The messages are clear and kid appropriate:  1. Don't do things just because they've always been done that way.  2.  Think for yourself.  3.  Get to know your enemy.  If you can't remember why you are fighting, it might be time to stop.

It is beautiful in style, very detailed, yet remains as a cartoon-like presentation.
While it is cartoon-like and child friendly, it touches base on a whole bunch of levels. It does not insult your intelligence, it does not resort to too much slapstick comedy but enough to make your child smile and laugh out loud once in a while.
As i stated earlier, it touches base on a lot of levels. It is a very deep movie, and will invoke a lot of feelings out of you even though this could be called a ""boy and his dog"" type movie. It is not that, it is so much more than that.

Out of all the movies this year, i have watched and re-watched this movie the most. It is beautiful and touching, and heartfelt. It uses just enough acting power to push the lines into believability, but not so much that the movie becomes about the actors instead of the lines they are reading and the powerful messages they send.

I suggest you get this movie, or atleast rent it to see why its so good.",1284595200,6,1013,4.216494845360825

The story we actually saw had more depth and more surprises than what I was expecting from an animated movie. I'm not going to go into the story. It is well documented. If you haven't read those reviews I don't want to be the one to provide the spoilers, but to be brief a Viking boy who is smart but a failure as a beefy warrior winds up with a different experience with the dragons his village has been at war with than his fellow villagers are having. You'll have a lot of fun as he learns to deal with his new situation, and astounds others with his new learned abilities.

The voice performances were convincing, and the animation was just plain fun. It was a more cartoon style animation than some of the more realistically based animated movies that have been produced recently, but that was just fine. The 3D in the theater was fun, but the Blu Ray will not disappoint. Colors in this movie are rich. Some of the dragons look dragon-scary, but some of them are silly and funny. Since this is a movie primarily for kids, the silly and funny dragons are just fine.

The score was beautiful!!! This is the only movie where I've gotten goosebumps from the music! (We'll besides Harry Potter) It's my Most Played on iTunes! Even if you haven't seen the movie yet the music will still give you the chills!

The characters are perfect in there own ways! Hiccup's sarcastic and witty attitude totally got to me because, well, I'm sarcastic and witty too! :) And Astrid's tough girl status totally showed that girl's can handle the action and adventure of battling dragons! And may we not forget Ruffnut and Tuffnut! They totally reminded me of my brother and I doing our fun/playful bickering! That just reminds me how much the character's relate to people!

4041813,5,B002ZG97Z6,"The LA Times reported that ""Dragon"" was a disaster after 3 years of production. Dreamworks called in story smiths Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois of ""Lilo and Stitch"" fame to repair it in two more. Sanders and Deblois have a knack for mixing Cute and Vicious, and what better film than one that tells the story of domesticating a wild dragon?

The results are fantastic; the buzz was that animators actually working on the film were in tears seeing their finished scenes cut together. I don't know if that story is true, but the dramatic tension in ""Dragon"" is worthy of an 86-minute film, the cinematography of Roger Deakins (normally a live-action guy) is some of the best I've seen in an animated film, and definitely this year.

I know this statement won't make me popular: the 3-D is overrated, and at times inhibits the film experience. My wife got headaches viewing it at times, and I never fully bought the experience as I had a big freaking pair of glasses on the whole time.",1280188800,5,983,4.611428571428571

I bought the last plush Toothless at the WalMart in my hometown for $15. Next thing I know, they're up for $75 on Amazon!

Anyway, I really liked it. Toothless is the most loveable dragon. Hiccup is adorable, too. I love the cast. I think it was very well done.

I remember when I was in the theater with my friend who I convinced to go see it with me because it looked hilarious. As we were watching I felt a little embarassed, like, ""okay.. this is really not THAT funny"". But as the movie progressed I was more impressed with the story than some lame jokes and slapstick incorporated into a children's story. The ending nearly brought me to tears.

Fantastic movie. My favorite this year.

I can't fairly judge foreign animated movies so I put the ""American"" disclaimer in front.  Watching this movie with my daughter was an absolute delight.  As I watched the story of Hiccup the Viking and his beloved dragon unfold, I became more engrossed in the story and found it very emotional and touching.  Points in the movie where you expect cliche things to happen they didn't, and I found the experience original and refreshing.

Shrek was a nice and creative Dreamworks movie, but I didn't feel it competed with Pixars' best.  Kung Fu Panda was fine, but very formulaic.  This animated movie (I won't call it a kids movie because ANYONE can love this) I found to be one of the most original things I had seen since the original Lilo & Stitch (a movie that I would also put on said top 10 list) and there was a good reason why I kept thinking of Lilo & Stich.  As the credits popped up on the screen, there appeared the names of Chris Sanders & Dean DeBlois, the directors and creators of the original masterpiece.

Believe the hype, this is 1 amazing movie and I can't recommend it highly enough.  Enjoy it once, twice, or 20+ times, this is a rare classic that comes around only once in a rare time, and Dreamworks has its magnum opus finally when it comes to animated films.

STARRING: The voices of: Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, America Ferrera, Craig Furguson, Jonah Hill, Chrostopher Mintz-Plasse, T.J. Miller and Kristen Wiig

It's amazing how far animation has come; literally milestones from where it originated. It allows us to go on adventures no real life characters or actual movie sets could take us to. There are virtually no limitations in its magical world and How to Train Your Dragon dabbles in this splendid availability relentlessly.

There's a reason movies like this and Avatar and Alice in Wonderland are raking in all the profits of consumers; they are the most fun to see in theaters. While I still remain a loyal patron to an abundance of movie stars, the days of an actor's name alone, filling seats are long gone for the majority of moviegoers. They want to be dazzled visually more than anything; thus the recent big to-do over 3-D and IMAX presentations. Bigger, brighter, and louder has now become better.

The animation style is something we haven't seen very much of. The characters are all generated to look slightly less perfect than we know they could. Big eyes, obscure heads and hairdos, and their personalities are all modernized while the film has them placed back in the Viking era.

Our hero is a boy named Hiccup and is ideally voiced by Jay Baruchel. Hiccups Dad is a massive burly Viking played by Gerard Butler and Hiccup may never live up to his manly expectations. His dad slays dragons and expects the same from him, and Hiccup just doesn't have the ambition to do this.

That is lessened even more, when he befriends a dragon in the forest. The two meet when no one is around and soon begin meeting in secret on a regularly basis. Of course the dragon has a wounded wing, and Hiccup tends to it and earns the beast's trust.

But what else would you have happen between a boy and a dragon? The film does not disappoint in making their connection enduring and fun-filled as the two take to the skies and bring us along for the ride. If there was ever a film worth paying an extra five bucks to see in 3-D, it's this one.",1275523200,2,2351,4.643373493975903

I'll be fourteen next month and I loved, loved, loved this movie. I went in expecting it to be 'nice' and such, but I came out in love! I sincerely felt for the characters, (dragons included!) unlike some of today's biggest films. (Hello, Avatar? I could care less.) I know the plot isn't that original, but it felt fesh and kept me enchanted. I loved the world Dreamworks created. Contrary to what some people are saying, I didn't feel like Hiccup was too witty and had 'a juno-esque feel' to him at all. Additionally, I can't even comprehend why some people are complaining about violence. Great movie!",1274054400,17,722,4.561538461538461
4041852,5,B002ZG97Z6,"How to Train Your Dragon is simply superb. It's a wonderfully heart-warming and beautifully animated film that's not only fun for kids, but also for adults. Of course, kids will love the big smashy Vikings and dragons, but for parents, grown-up kids and animation fans, there's plenty of other things to love: a kooky cast of characters, some witty and sarcastic dialog, and the lush and lovingly-rendered CG visuals. Dreamworks grows by leaps and bounds with each successive film in terms of animation technology, and this is their best work yet, looking even better than the fantastic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Panda-Blu-ray/dp/B00168OINK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Panda [Blu-ray</a>]. But besides that, it's got an entertaining story that audiences of all ages can appreciate.

This is the story of a scrawny, wimpy boy named Hiccup, who lives in the village of Berk. The film begins with him introducing us to his miserable island ""twelve days north of Hopeless and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death"" and its pest problem-- dragons! Here's where the dragons come in and the scene quickly changes to one of comic chaos. As the Vikings run around fending off the fire-breathing raiders, Hiccup is told by everyone to get out of the way and get back inside. He desperately wants to impress the people of his village and earn their respect, especially his father, Stoick the Vast, the leader of their tribe and a brave Viking, who sees his son as a nuisance at best and a disappointment. During the raid, he makes a mess trying to help, but not without shooting down a rare and mysterious Night Fury first (the fiercest of them all). Problem is, no one believes him because he's such a bungler.

Afterwards, Hiccup sneaks off to the woods to find the injured dragon with the intent of finishing the job and proving his Vikingness. He is unable to and over time, he befriends the dragon, who he names Toothless. He uses his blacksmithing skills to create a tail fin for his injured buddy and through Toothless, he learns a lot about taming and training dragons (hence the film's title). Hiccup eventually becomes proud of who he is and earns the respect of all his friends and villagers. At the end, we are treated to a spectacular fight in gorgeous 3D CG and he returns home a hero. Everyone is happy. Village is safe, father-son issues resolved, boy gets girl.

It's all very wholesome entertainment with a good, positive story for kids and adults. Amusingly, the Viking characters all have Scottish accents, which is a stroke of genius. Many of the funnier, sarcastic lines are delivered by Gobbler (voiced by comedian Craig Ferguson), the one armed, one legged blacksmith, Stoick's 2nd in command, and Hiccup's mentor. Stoick himself is voiced by Gerard Butler (another Scot), who has played a Norse warrior before in the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beowulf-Grendel-Blu-ray/dp/B000UYX4OK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beowulf & Grendel [Blu-ray</a>]. Stoick's animated mannerisms and gestures are perfectly captured! They look exactly like Butler's movements and facial expressions from other films and the animators did an excellent job bringing all the nuances to life onscreen. Ferguson and Butler's voices add a lot of personality to the film. The only thing I found annoying was Hiccup's voice (Jay Baruchel), who speaks in a nasal monotone and self-deprecating deadpan most of the time. I also didn't care for any of the other kid characters in the film. They are dull and forgettable, without really any memorable lines, funny moments, or interesting accents to set them apart.

The sets, camerawork and lush detailing of all the characters, props, environments, and dragons is top-notch and it's clear a lot of love and attention went into making this film. The Nordic ship designs, for example, are particularly well done. How To Train Your Dragon is a fun movie and well worth seeing.",1273968000,,4024,5.273010920436818
