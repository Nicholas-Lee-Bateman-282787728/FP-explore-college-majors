2009174,5,B0001KNHT0,This is a great documentary about race and teenage rebellion in America when some teenage Latinos and Caucasian sailors have a tussel during World War II that leads to a riot in Los Angeles. I am looking for it to show in my classroom but you can get it directly from PBS for $19.99 so don't waste your money here.,1135036800,6,314,4.25

2009186,4,B0001KNHT0,Enjoyed watching this movie about the Alamo.. We had visited it about ten years ago..So I was exited to see it again. Sure enough there were some fact I had forgot about.. So it was very interesting to have this...my father loves History so I let him watch it..He thought it was fantastic ..we are having fun talking about it..,1415577600,2,327,4.466666666666667
2009187,5,B0001KNHT0,Wife wanted this for her students in Texas History. They are bored by didactic and felt tv would help. It would be better if Songe Bob defended the Alamo for what most of the care.,1382745600,,180,4.171428571428572
2009188,2,B0001KNHT0,"Didn't care for the film My self,  I had one serious problem,  It's in Spanish, the whole movie, I tried to get it in English, It doesn't have it in English.  The Pictures wonderful. They need to make one in English.",1368662400,,216,4.219512195121951
2009189,4,B0001KNHT0,This is not the traditional take on the Alamo.  It shows the role of Mexican Texans (Tejanos) who also fought for independence from Mexico.  Then it highlights that these former brothers in the fight were later seen as enemies and their land taken from them.  Well done and interesting.  I have shown it to 11th and 12th graders and got a very positive response.,1344211200,3,362,4.609375
2009190,2,B0001KNHT0,"Let me say this: this dvd is not what most people would expect from the title at all.  If you are a student of military history, forget this dvd.  Less than two minutes are devoted to the actual fight.  Basically, it says a young Tejano boy is asleep in the Alamo, he hears his mom shout that the Mexicans are attacking, there is some shooting and hand to hand combat, and it's over.  From this dvd you would think the Mexicans attacked once, and the Alamo fell.  Want to learn about Davey Crockett?  He's barely even mentioned.  Jim Bowie?  The same.  Forget about the last stand at the chapel, the line in the sand, heck it doesn't even mention Santa Anna spared the women, children, and the slaves.  The reinforcements that made it to the Alamo?  Not mentioned either.

However, if you do want to learn a different perspective on the Alamo, this isn't a bad dvd.  It focuses exclusively on the contributions of the Tejanos to the independence of Texas.",1341619200,14,955,4.514619883040936
2009191,5,B0001KNHT0,"This is one of the rarest shows that present a different point of view. It is rare to see a show like this. Hopefully, there will be other shows like this one.",1321833600,3,159,4.0
2009192,1,B0001KNHT0,"Very disappointing.  We bought this video for my son prior to making a trip to the Alamo.  After previewing it, we didn't even bother to show it to him.  That said, if you want to learn about the native Tejanos or Mexicans that lived in Texas than this might be what you are looking for, but otherwise the movie really didn't talk about the history of the Alamo.  If you want to learn about the Alamo look elsewhere....  We were very disappointed with this DVD.",1299888000,23,461,4.376470588235295
2009193,2,B0001KNHT0,"While the Tejanos certainly played a role in the Texian Revolution, that role is exaggerated in REMEMBER THE ALAMO. Of a garrison of roughly 200 men,9 Tejanos died in the Alamo; but 25 fought at the battle of San Jacinto with Sam Houston's 910 man army. One became vice-President of the Republic.

Mexico itself was in rebellion at the time, with two other provinces taking up arms against Santa Anna's dictarorial rule. The general had destroyed the legal Mexican constitution of 1824 and set up a centralist state. When the Province of Zacatecas rose up in rebellion, Santa Anna  brutally crushed the rebels, then allowed his victorious troops two days of rape and pillage that took the lives of over 2000 non-combatants, including women. REMEMBER THE ALAMO does not address this issue, and yet makes a point of painting the Texians as wetbacks that Mexico had a right to expel.

Throughout the revolution, it was the Texians who held the moral high ground. The Texians took prisoners and treated them well. The Mexican army did not; they killed them. The Texians tended to the Mexican wounded with compassion; the Mexican army murdered the sick in their beds, promished the 400 vanquished at Goliad that they would be sent home, then murdered them, as well. REMEMBER THE ALAMO does not address these facts, either. While many accounts of the Texian revolt have certainly been biased in the favor of the Texians, the bias shown in REMEMBER THE ALAMO is shamefully blatant. It presents debatable theories as 'facts'. The manner of Crockett's death, for instance remains unproven; the number of Texians in the Alamo remain unknown.

As a piece of fantasy, REMEMBER THE ALAMO may amuse the serious historian. Unfortunately, the general viewing public, that gets all of its history from TV and the movies, will unwaveringly accept it as the solid truth. And there the danger lies.",1210723200,14,1878,4.9335443037974684
2009194,5,B0001KNHT0,This is a well done program about a slice of 1940's Los Angeles history that could easily be forgotten. Many witnesses and participants in the World War II era events are interviewed and their recollections should be priceless as primary sources to historians of the future. Music of the time as well as photographs and newspaper accounts supplement the stories of those that were actually there. I actually borrowed this from the library so I can't speak to the price as another reviewer did but this is a quality production.,1159660800,2,526,4.855555555555555

Also, it was unlike the Dave Crockett type of history. Well worth watching only I wish it was longer.",1501632000,,300,4.375
