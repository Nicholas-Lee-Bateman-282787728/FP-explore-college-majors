8610465,2,B000TKG62C,"It is a poorly filmed documentary of the 1986 single handed Transpac.  Due to the age of the original film the color and definition of the film really shows its age.  Much of it appears to be black and white.  The sound quality is horrendous.  This should have been dubbed over when it was converted from VHS to disk.  I am dismayed that anyone would release a DVD with such poor quality sound when it could have been easily fixed.  If you are looking for information on improving your single handed cruising or racing, this is not the DVD for you.  It is interesting to watch if you can put up with the overall poor quality.
