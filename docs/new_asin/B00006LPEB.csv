1785184,5,B00006LPEB,"This is a great series.  Sometimes you just need a laugh, and this package will deliver.  Frankenthumb is fantastic.  Be sure to watch the cast interviews and other special features.  These are often as good as the feature.",1084233600,2,223,4.7894736842105265
1785185,5,B00006LPEB,Oh sweet mother of god!  These movies are one of the funniset things i have ever seen!  I laughed so hard i cried and got chest pains.  I have watched it over and over and it gets funnier every time.  I definetly reccomend this to anyone who loves to laugh.,1060041600,6,257,4.08

1785187,5,B00006LPEB,"If you like a good parody, these are for you.  Oedekerk is my hero.  My kids think they are funny, too.  I think you have to be somewhat familiar with the films that they parody to fully appreciate all the references.",1041033600,4,217,4.2439024390243905
1785188,5,B00006LPEB,"Contains the six ""Thumb"" movies as originally released, original case, artwork, and all, each of which remains available seperately. There is no new content in the box set, but this makes a great gift or starter collection (especially at the... price)and each of these films is a must-have for lovers of parody and offbeat humor. After you're done watching the films, be sure to catch the ""cast interviews"" and additional features, many of which are as funny or more so than the films.",1039651200,22,485,4.855421686746988
1785189,5,B00006LPEB,"Every movie is so funny that you want to watch them over and over. Watch with your cronies and you'll walk away with clichs that you'll share for further laughs. There hasn't been anything else so unique and sarcastic on so many levels. Its even funny if you haven't seen the original movie that is being parodied. If you did see the original movie, you'll notice things about it that you didn't before. The parodies have been done so well. I love have the extra commentaries and deleted scenes.
The special effects of the thumbs with all the high tech computer savy are even parodied, being used along side some low tech props. It's hilarious.
Go for the Box set, best price in the world.",1038787200,2,689,4.52
1785190,4,B00006LPEB,"These ""thumb-ette"" mini movies are SOOOOOOO FUNNY!!  My Favorite is ""FRANKENTHUMB"". How does Oedekerk do those Faces!??  Anyway, the BEST part about this is, it's released on my 40th Birthday, and i NEED a GOOD laugh! (hehe)...40 yrs old, UGHHHHHH!",1037404800,,248,5.175
1785206,5,B00006LPEB,Steve Oedekerk is a comic genius. These would be hilarious even if it weren't for the odd freaky thumby theme. But the thumbs are awesome in their own right. Awesome stuff!,1384473600,,172,4.580645161290323

1785210,3,B00006LPEB,My son and I had seen Frankenthumb and Thumb Wars on a children's network.  We thought they were really funny! I didn't realize that there were inappropriate sections not shown on TV.  So I was suprised after buying and watching these CDs.  Batthumb and Thumbtanic both have sex sceens.  We will be getting rid of those movies!,1280102400,4,327,4.684210526315789

1785212,4,B00006LPEB,Back in 2003 I was able to pick up this set for $5.00 right here on Amazon! Most of the films are pretty funny and well worth a look. I wouldn't pay more than $30.00 for the set though as you would be experiencing diminishing returns a.k.a. bang for the buck.,1228262400,,259,4.098039215686274

1785214,1,B00006LPEB,"If it were not for the many sexual innuendos in these movies, I would have rated them maybe a 3 because I do enjoy some satire.  But I wanted to draw attention that these movies have similar adult humor as in the Simpsons cartoon and Saturday Nite Live....so buyer beware.  These movies are not rated professionally but the content should be described on Amazon as to what may be offensive to some.  I bought this collection because of 2 reviews on Amazon that said these were clean and innocent enough for kids. Although one did say in the title that not all the Thumb movies were OK for children.  I didn't see that person's headline or 1 star..only that they put in their review ""innocent enough for children"".  I goofed and listened to those reviews.  I wish I hadn't.  If only I could have rented it first but I couldn't find it to rent.  Our kids love the Star Wars movies so I thought Thumb Wars and the other thumb movies would be funny to watch together as a family.  Sure they're somewhat funny but I wasn't laughing hysterically and we ""all"" were caught off guard by the sexual innuendos.  I'm only going to list their real characters because I forgot their humorous thumb names.  Case in point:  1 scene has the Obiwan and Luke thumb characters getting down on the floor and looking up the dress of the hologram of Princess Leah.  Another scene has Obiwan telling Luke to make sure he doesn't have any girl clothes on underneath his own clothes?  Oh yeah...then there's the scene when Obiwan wants to seal a deal with Luke and asks that they touch their tongues together (which doesn't actually happen, thank God)....and another, where R2D2 and C3PO are getting intimate with each other before someone interrupts them when entering the room.  I'm sure there was more.  We didn't even finish watching that movie.  Our 15 year old had enough sense to walk out of the room. If this is the kind of humor that you want your kids to see, I'm sure you'll love it.  As for me, I'm going to try and return the collection or throw it out.  Think twice before wasting your hard earned money on them!",1174089600,6,2100,4.493403693931398

1785225,5,B00006LPEB,Each thumb movie satirizes it's respective movie in a hilarious way. The movies are clean so the whole family can enjoy them. My children and I find ourselves quoting the lines from the thumb movies often.,1152403200,5,205,4.722222222222222
1785226,4,B00006LPEB,"OK, I just had to come up with some stupid pun for my title. Sorry. Anyway, this set is well worth the money. While the rest of the movies are hit-and-miss, Thumb Wars, Thumbtanic, and The Godthumb are instant classics. All it really takes to enjoy any one of these shorts is a basic knowledge of the film they are parodying (if that's not already a word, it is now). More extensive knowledge of the film allows the viewer to pick up on the subtler details of the shorts, details that are well thought-out and sure to provide the well-versed audience with a laugh or two. The variety of the shorts in the box set ensures that almost anyone will be able to sit down and enjoy at least one of these shorts, and for the price at which they are offered, I highly recommend this set.",1151193600,4,778,4.299319727891157

1785231,4,B00006LPEB,"first of all HI CAROLINE<333... anyway, these films are very funny , at least most of them are.  The only one that i cant really judge is 'The Godthumb' because i never saw 'The Godfather , and i knew that the jokes would be funnier if i saw it.  You HAVE to buy this.  If you would like to see some clips and their type of humor, go to [...] and go to O Clips.  But the actual movies are funnier than the previews.  Me and my friend CAROLINE watch the trailer for  'thumbtanic' all the time and laugh our heads off.  The jokes are really funny but the thumbs' faces make it even funnier.  Here is what i thought of the movies:

Thumb Wars- B-
The Blair Thumb- A+ (very funny)
Thumbtanic- A
Bat Thumb- A
Frankenthumb- C-
The Godthumb- C+ ( if you saw 'The Godfather , which i didnt, the jokes would be much funnier )

BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1107475200,5,868,4.3354037267080745
1785232,1,B00006LPEB,"I had seen the Godthumb and Thumbtanic and thought they were hilarious.  I didn't find anything too objectionable and thought overall it was good innocent entertainment for my kids.

Stick with the individual titles you know.  This set mixes the family friendly thumb movies with some of his lesser known titles.

I particularly found ""Pink Thumbingos"", ""Freddy Got Thumbed"" and ""Cuticlegula"" to be very inappropriate for family viewing.",1100908800,8,437,5.382352941176471

7971606,5,B00006LPEB,"This series is one of those rare pieces of entertainment that only comes along every once in a while.  I remember first seeing 'Thumb Wars' and 'Thumbtanic' back when they first came out.  They were in my local video store and looked bizarre, so I grabbed them.  I had zero expectations when I started, but they blew me away!  For years I did not even realize there were more.  Finally I found this set a few years back and it remains one of the best gifts I ever received.
Fast forward a few years and now I have the joy of watching these films with my 5-year old son.  He loves them and can act out many of the scenes.  My favorite is a toss up between 'The Blair Thumb' and 'Godthumb'.  These films are endlessly quotable and manage to parody the films like are mocking in a concise and funny manner.  Forget the modern genre parody movies, these are the best parody films since Mel Brooks.  Would recommend to anybody!",1390435200,,922,4.3391812865497075
