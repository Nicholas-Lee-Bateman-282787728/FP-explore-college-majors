Though I have seen the first episode, and it is pretty good.",1217808000,,243,4.651162790697675
8212106,5,B000U585VG,"Don't listen to the other people basing their reviews on a defunct studio. This review is about the actual show and not about the vendor.

The first of the Rozen Maiden series (1-3) was a good starting point for this anime.  Rozen Maiden Traumend is basically Season 2 of the series with a whole new plot.  It has more depth, more story and you realize the intricate relationships the Rozen Maiden's have with one another.  It makes you laugh, cry and get angry as you become closer to each of the dolls and their unique personalities.  Truly a great anime.",1207785600,3,557,4.53
8212107,5,B000U585VG,"Rozen Maiden Traumend picks up right where the previous season left off. With Jun preparing to go back to school and all the dolls at home having fun with each other. Shinku has trouble dealing with the fact that she turned Suigintou into junk and the 2 remaining dolls show up thus signalling the beginning of the Alice Game.

This volume has all of the fun and the drama and the action of the previous series and if you loved the first season you should pick up the second.

While the distributor Geneon entertainment is closing down. Bang! Zoom! entertainment is still finishing up the dub which means that it will be distributed by someone at some point. So yes the series will be fully available It is just that no one can say exactly when.

UPDATE
Funimation has announced that they will continue the distribution of Rozen Maiden from the second half of 2007.",1194480000,14,865,4.567741935483871
8212108,1,B000U585VG,Don't buy from Geneon/Pioneer! It's a waste of time and money! You won't get the rest of the season/series from them! Find yourself an Import sorce. It maybe a sub but atleast you'll get the whole season/series.,1194393600,5,211,4.72972972972973
