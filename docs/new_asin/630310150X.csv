7838151,4,630310150X,"I became a Julian Sands fan after watching A Room with A View. But I have since found that alot of his movies can be hit or miss. This movie while no means a masterpiece is definately not a miss. The movie kept me engaged and entertained. There was not a boring part in the entire movie.
Julian Sands plays an uptight British Lawyer(Julian Sands is exellent in this role!)who happens to find himself in the wrong  place at the wrong time. This place- Tennessee. All the man wants to do is fish but he can't seem to find the time due to being chased by faceless robbers and finding himself entangled with a teen runaway.
I found myself more interested in his burgeoning relationship with the runaway(Stacey Dash from Clueless) than the robbery. You can see him trying to fight his  growing attraction to this underage black girl. Later he is a bit mean by throwing her out of his car, but if you take it from the character's point of view you can sortof understand because he feels betrayed and scared(excellent playing frightened especially when he is in prison).
After seeing Dario Argentos' Phantom  and being disappointed, Julian Sands Phantom and Asia Argento's Chrisitne have no chemistry whatsoever. Zero. Zilch. Nada, I was pleasantly surprised to see the chemistry between Julian Sands character in Black Water and Stacey Dash. It was very believable.
The part where he touches her hair, very sexy.
I recommend this highly.",1083715200,7,1431,4.762096774193548
7838152,4,630310150X,"This film is the story of a British college professor who goes for a short fishing trip to Tennessee and gets more than he bargained for.  He witnesses the murder of a young woman who has slipped a mysterious package into the professor's car.  Next he is chased by the ""bad guys"" without really knowing what they are after.  He meets a young black girl who may be involved with the ""bad guys""...you are kept guessing right up to the end of the movie.  I thought both Julian Sands and Stacie Dash played excellent roles in this film.  I bought a used VHS tape of this movie for $2 and thoroughly enjoyed it.",1054512000,3,606,4.327433628318584
