8758894,5,B01EIXEBPO,"This movie embodies real emotion of the fragile ego and embraces the comradery of friendship. Veteran actors Stephen Tobolowsky  & Clint Howard add a special touch to the ensemble cast of fresh-faced, younger actors.  The main character of Ben (Ben Solenberger) draws you into his life and transports your feelings  of consciousness to many levels.
