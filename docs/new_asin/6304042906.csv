765923,3,6304042906,"I've never been to historic Galesburg, Illinois, but it seems like a interesting place, from what I've heard...there's a railroad museum, a Carl Sandberg historical site, the Galesburg Civic Art Center, the historic Orpheum Theater, the Stockdale Soldier Citizen Museum, a chocolate festival, the historic tram tour, and more...an interesting aspect, though, is I find nary a mention of the events depicted in this film, Strange Behavior (1981) aka Dead Kids, in any of the tourism literature, but then again, I suppose serial killings aren't something one would generally promote when trying to draw in visitors (and their dough).  Co-written by Michael Laughlin (Strange Invaders, Town & Country) and Bill Condon (Strange Invaders, Gods and Monsters, Kinsey), and directed by Laughlin, the film features Michael Murphy (Count Yorga, Vampire, Batman Returns), Dan Shor (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure), and Fiona Lewis (Dr. Phibes Rises Again, Tintorera).  Also appearing is Louise Fletcher (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Cheap Detective), Arthur Dignam (The Devil's Playground), Dey Young (Rock 'n' Roll High School), Charles Lane (The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, The Gnome-Mobile), Marc `Jimmy Olsen' McClure (Superman, Back to the Future), and Scott Brady (The Mighty Gorga, The Cycle Savages), who was once offered the role of Archie Bunker on the television show ""All in the Family"", but turned it down...

The film, set in Galesburg, Illinois, wastes little time as, within the first five minutes, someone dies from a serious cases of puncturitis (i.e. stabbed with a knife one too many times)...and from there we meet aspiring college student Pete Brady and his father John, who happens to be the sheriff in the small town.  Pete wants to go to the local college, but his father wants him to pick an out of state school for the purpose of broadening his horizons, but that's not the main reason...seems there was some unpleasantness at the local college involving strange experiments facilitated by a now deceased scientist named Dr. Le Sange.  Pete's determined to attend the local college, but needs some dough for registration fees, to which his friend Oliver (McClure) turns him on to a gig within the college psychology department, run by Ms. Parkinson (Lewis).  That's right, Pete is now a guinea pig, participating in some sort of behavioral modification experiments, which include, among other things, taking a `smart' drug and getting a six inch needle in the eyeball (ouch!).  As Pete puts the moves on Caroline (Young), a student/receptionist at the school lab (who smokes like a chimney), his father is struggling to make sense of the recent spate of murders, ones which appear to be serial killings, but not necessarily performed by the same loony tune.  John, seeing he's in over his head, calls Chicago for help, and homicide detective Shea (Brady), bad comb over and all, makes the scene...just as John's girlfriend Barbara (Fletcher) dumps a heaping, steaming load of exposition in our laps, things really begin to pick up as Galesburg's top cop thinks he knows the score, and Pete begins exhibiting, yep, you guessed it, strange behavior.

Despite its weaknesses, I enjoyed this film and thought it was pretty well done, especially considering it was a first effort for both Michael Laughlin and Bill Condon, whose next project would be Strange Invaders (1983), a decently creepy, underrated science fiction film.  The cast was certainly professional, except for the guy playing the coroner...that guy was just plain awful.  I like Fiona Lewis as I think she's really easy on the eyes, but I wasn't sure what was going on with that retro hairstyle she was sporting...still, it didn't detract my desire to be one of her test subjects, although the aspect of having to get a giant needle stuck in my eyeball did...slightly.  The movie features some well-done suspense, but veers off into odd, uncharted waters at times, particularly the choreographed dance sequence, to the tune of Lou Christie's ""Lighting Strikes"", during the costume party.  Also, the storyline does drag in a number of spots, something which probably could have been mitigated had the makers lopped off about ten or fifteen minutes of the running time.  Also, it felt like there were just a few too many characters running around, so what happens is not enough focus is dedicated towards those characters that should have been predominate in the actual storyline, but, as they say, hindsight is 20/20.  A perfect example of this is Brady's character of Detective Shea...what was the point of his character, other than to relay how the events transpiring were nothing new to him to which he goes into a lengthy bit about how, during a past case, he witnessed a grisly scene involving a serial killer and the chopped up bodies of his female victims?  It was kinda funny, in a macabre sense, but really had no relation to the story itself.  Some of the elements in the story required a bit of an intuitive leap from the audience, but I'm not sure if that was the intent, or if it was more due to lackadaisical writing...I'm leaning towards the latter, especially considering the awkward expository sequence about three quarters in where Louise Fletcher's character spills the proverbial beans.  And why did the various murders involve all sorts of mutilation?  There seemed little sense to this particular aspect, especially after the motives behind the crimes are revealed (did someone order up a cold plate of revenge?).  I did like the well-crafted musical score provided by Tangerine Dream, as it set the mood appropriately, and made the creepy sequences even more so...there are some brutal scenes, but these are few and sprinkled throughout the running time, as the film seems to focus more on trying to develop a continual sense of unease, rather than slop on the gore.  I did like the neat, little twist near the end, as it was something I felt I should have seen coming after the fact, but didn't...

Elite Entertainment provides a good-looking anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) picture on this DVD release.  There are some minor flaws, but nothing to lose any sleep over.  The audio, presented in stereo, I believe, comes through clean and clearly.  There are a number of special features included like two theatrical trailers for the film, two deleted scenes (with commentary), a photo gallery, extensive filmographies, an isolated musical score track, a commentary track with writer Bill Condon and actors Dan Shor and Dey Young, and trailers for other releases including Patrick (1978), Thirst (1979), and Syngenor (1990).

There are a few shots, that are almost too close to the real thing. I haven't seen this movie in awhile. The local video store had it with the title Dead Kids.

One of what I call a good bad movie. it is really predictable, it was from 1981 so we have to take that into account. the acting is not the best but it looks like the actors snow that this script leaves a lot to be desired and are just getting a paycheck. the one real high point has to be Dan Shor (from the original Tron) he rises above all the flaws and does an admirable job. if you like the kind of 80's fun bad films, go for it, if you are a stickler for perfect films, this won't cut it.

765980,5,6304042906,"all 80s slasher film fans owe it to themselves to watch this simply great flick. the gore is pretty good, the story is great, but the feel of the film and the acting is what i really love, it looks like the actors had so much fun making this movie",1387670400,,247,3.96
765981,4,6304042906,"Don't let the unpleasant title put you off, this is an excellent little movie that I actually found quite entertaining. The acting is top class especially from Dan Shor and Michael Murphy who star. Louise Fletcher is also on top form and all three bring a realistic almost 'cinema veritie' feel to the proceedings.

The film works because of Michael laughlins direction that develops the film on many levels. On the one hand there is lots of atmosphere and a suspenseful intensity that builds up to the films climax yet Laughlin also concentrates on character development and relationships giving us insights in to Chief Bradys (Michael Murphy) mysterious past and the close father/son relationship him and Pete (Dan Shor) have.

The film also pays close attention to small town life. In this small Louisiana town everyone knows everyone there are lots of nice little touches by Laughlin to point this out. Laughlins direction also has a humorous edge to it and the good acting adds to this. There is one incredibly surreal scene in the movie at a party where all the 'party-goers' start dancing in unison! They are all in 50's style fancy dress and dance in a hyperbolic 50's fashion! Although it is hard to decipher Laughlins motives here this scene seems incredibly inspired to me personally. Although some scenes in this film are quite shocking I cannot comment on the amount of gore in this film because I have only seen the cut release which has been cut considerably and panned and scanned.

Strange killings disturb a small town, could the local college have something to do with it?  Strange Behavior is a truly original piece of work.  Its incredibaly atmospheric (helped by an excellent Tangerine Dream score).  It is also quite greusome in spots, however, this is far from your typical hack and slash thriller that dominated the 80s horror genre.  Strange Behavior is more original and thoughtful and scary to boot.  I love to come across these weird virtually forgotten horror films, they usually have more to offer than most of the newer mainstream stuff.  If your in the mood for something different and do not have a week stomach than I highly recommened Strange behavior.",1327795200,,822,4.956204379562044
765984,4,6304042906,"I remember seeing this movie way back in the 80's, in my early teens, on the late show. It had a strange and quirky quality to it which made an indelible impression. So many years later, like a vision (or perhaps a flashback), the idea of reconnecting with this movie popped into my head. So I ordered it. And, to my delight, the movie hasn't lost any of its original charm. If anything, I love it even more. I can't explain the oddness of the film... I don't know if it's intentional or accidental, but I imagine many factors contributed to its overall design: The Setting: Auckland, New Zealand masquerading as Galesburg, Illinois; Acting: script/dialogue provides no great stretch for any of its main players, but credible performances from veteran actors Michael Murphy, Fiona Lewis, Louise Fletcher, Arthur Dignam, and Dan Shor are well-suited; Soundtrack: an atmospheric musical score by German electronic group Tangerine Dream, sprinkled with Lou Christie's ""Lightnin' Strikes"" and New Zealand pop act Pop Mechanix's ""Jumping Out a Window"" adds an additional bizarre tone, and, lastly, and most importantly... The Story: a sinister tale of revenge about mind-altering experiments turning the student population at Galesburg College into knife-wielding killers, engineers the right amount of mystery, suspense, and dark humor. Director Michael Laughlin and writer Bill Condon (known for Gods and Monsters, Chicago, and Dream Girls) manage to imbue a dreamlike, creepy, and almost hallucinatory skin to this low-budget experiment, giving the audience more than just a slasher film. The DVD package isn't anything special with very little extra features, but don't let that discourage you... it's worth taking a look.",1323820800,2,1721,5.3076923076923075
765985,3,6304042906,"This flick from 1981 is a interesting entry into the slasher genre of the period.  The film has a mad doctor which gives it a different edge. It is also full of many excellent actors who have a long history in films and stage and that's a plus. The first time director came up with a decent little low budget horror movie here , in which college students go on gory rampages under the control of the mad doctor. The strangest thing here though is the lack of closeup shots. Almost every sceen is Not a closeup, in fact I don't remember any closeups! The camera is usually four to more feet away from the action, this is a strange behaviour case for sure. But you still get lots of cool 80's rock songs and a great erie synth score as well. It's a average flick of it's type and at least you get alot of really good actors in it.  The print looks decent too , not restored , this one would be great as part of a double feature blu ray probably! sooner or later that will happen and lots more of these little films will emerge,
However I do hope that someone grabs 'strange invaders' from these same folks and puts it out on blu ray. It's a cult classic and a A+ effort that even has a closeup in it!",1290816000,2,1198,4.115384615384615

7859762,3,6304042906,Not sure this counts as a slasher movie. It's way underacted and too languid to put you on edge. There isn't any tension. Louise Fletcher is the best thing about this movie.,1521763200,,173,4.4375
7859763,5,6304042906,"Make no mistake, this is purely a low budget horror flick. I first got acquainted with is a midnight movie on the local independent TV station. It's cheesie goodness, and kinda scary too in places.

This film follows the story of a group of teenagers in a small mid-western town whose lives are interrupted by a series of brutal and inexplicable murders. Meanwhile, a local pharmaceutical company is conducting secretive experiments. But all of this is lost on the son of the local Sheriff who has started dating the night receptionist at the pharmaceutical company where his late mother worked.  Confused yet? Don't worry it all comes together in the film.

The characters are likable, the music is catchy... Top 40 actually.  But this isn't a low budget horror film in the tradition of Plan 9 from Outer Space or Ankle Biters, this is a quality film. The plot may have holes here and there, but the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts.

In it's own way, Strange Behavior, (Originally titled ""Dead Kids"") is an artifact of the 80's... or maybe the 70's... it came out in '81. This is part of the appeal. In an era of slasher films, and Strange Behavior had its share of slashing, this film offered an element of mystery and depth that it's contemporaries lacked.

This is not Shakespeare, it's not Edgar Allen Poe, but it's an enjoyable romp through the post grindhouse low budget film landscape.

7859766,3,6304042906,"Warning: Spoilers!

I viewed Strange Behavior the other night on Amazon streaming (via ShudderTV). The reviews on it were quite good, both from viewers and the original newspaper/magazine reviewers when the film was released in 1981. While I think it was well crafted and definitely VERY well acted for a low budget film, I never quite connected with it.

I'm not a Millenial. In fact this film was released while I was in college (which is probably why I didn't see it at the time). I can appreciate a slow build to climax - and I even appreciate it; and I can very much appreciate a film that keeps me a bit on edge due to slight bits of missing information (Phantasm and A Nightmare on Elm Street come to mind). However, Strange Behavior seemed to be leaving out some information/content that would greatly have improved its impact. Tension. There's very little tension built up. There's a vague back story, but we're not given enough information to understand how it relates to the present time of the film. And then there is the WHY. Evil scientists I can understand, but even Dr. Frankenstein let us know that the reason he was creating a living being from dead bodies was to aid in preventing death from disease and disaster. Here, it makes no sense why the scientists are creating murderers.

With those criticisms out of the way, I want to tell you that Dan Shor as the protagonist is absolutely believable and pitch perfect. He's a young college student whose father happens to be the sheriff (or chief of police - it's never really explained and he does not wear a uniform so....).

As a former stage director, I love many parts of the film:
1. For instance, there's a scene early in the film that let's us know that there is no mother or other siblings in the household. It is not explicitly stated, rather it is a scene of the father (Michael Murphy) shaving in the bathroom while talking on the phone. In walks - naked as the day he was born (rear) - Dan Shor, the son, who waits until his father finishes shaving and talking on the phone. Once his father is off the phone - without any acknowledgement of each other - Shor gets in the shower and the father leaves the bathroom. It is not titillating in a gay way in the least (except that Shor has a great build), but it lets the audience know this is a house with just men in it.

2. Shor and his best friend go to a party at a friend's house and gab about what's going on at the party and the girls at the party. It's all very natural and it feels completely real. Then Shor starts flirting with a girl and then they begin to dance. This dance scene is so completely natural and real - the guys are dancing the way we really danced in 1981 (which is to say not very well but completely real - doing the pogo and just jumping around and goofing). Add to that, the music is an early 1960's song Lightning Strikes and you get a sense that the song is sort of a favorite of the whole group. The whole party scene works well.

Actually it's the scenes in the laboratory and the ones with Louise Fletcher that seem strained.

I didn't dislike the film, but I didn't really like it either. I can see myself going back and watching the dance scene a couple more times - it's really fun, but beyond that, the film just sort of peters out.",1480982400,,3296,4.358306188925082

7859770,4,6304042906,"Strange Behavior is pretty goofy. It's the sort of gory 50s horror film parody film that could only be made in the 80s when gore was the main cinema currency next to bad taste. Ronald Reagan sure drove everyone in the entertainment biz crazy.

I'm not knocking it. It's pretty well done even though it never really sticks to the 50s horror film parody as much as it does simply elements of it. The funniest thing is that there's a random musical sequence at the beginning of the movie that slowly builds up before cutting to some 80s styled, 50s flavored slashing. The special effects are pretty good too. The gore looks good and the blood looks just fake enough to get the right kindle of laughter. Basically, you don't want something to real looking or it quits being parody and turns into something else entirely.

If you can find a cheap DVD of this, I'd snatch it up. It's fun and campy without pushing things too far into joke land. It never talks down to you or it's genre but just teases it. Thankfully, the makers of this film don't hate their audience.",1475712000,,1062,4.469072164948454

This look at the American small town life is fresh because it's from an Australian point of view. A few details are off, such as the police chief not carrying a gun, and the kids have a British schoolboy feel to them, but the result of it is that you do not take the horror aspect of it too seriously, and you can relax watching the film and appreciate its scenery. It is a horror film, and it manages to scare and startle without too much gore. This film works wonderfully if you don't expect too much, and the cinematography is awesome.",1455494400,,712,4.32089552238806
