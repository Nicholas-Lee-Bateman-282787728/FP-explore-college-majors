8762594,2,B01G93HKW2,"I did not buy the DVD and have been trying to contact Amazon Prime to request that they make the movie ""MY FAIR LADY"" available to stream.  I do not wish to have a bunch of DVD's laying about, getting scratched, or lost and prefer to have a library of Streaming Videos instead!  I would like Amazon Prime to obtain/create a REMASTERED version of MY FAIR LADY with AUDREY HEPBURN.  I chatted with a CSR named Colin who suggested I go to BroadwayHD and I would be able to see the movie there; well it isn't there, there is only a documentary with that name!  Not the movie.  I want to buy a streaming video of  MY FAIR LADY, with Audrey Hepburn.  I do not wish to watch a documentary.  Another complaint I have is the 'Boiler Plate"" answers in the HELP section of AMAZON.  Not everything can be answered by these and if there is no way to contact someone who can actually do something it is very frustrating.  The only (possibly) good thing about this is when the people who came up with these Boiler plate answers go to another site and receive the same treatment.  It seem obvious though that this has not happened yet as they would change this if they had!
a note: ***  Society is changing, crime  and drug use are going up, I feel this is mainly due to companies who refuse to hire people in favor of using a computer program to satisfy customer needs.  Granted a computer program does not need a paycheck, is always there on time every time but it is so impersonal and annoying but also it deprives a HUMAN of a JOB!  As corporations decrease employees, this means less potential customers who are ABLE TO BUY ANYTHING!  Eventually as CEO's  obtain higher salaries and in my opinion a $100 Million or more salary is absurd; and more people are out of work, just who will be left to buy the products or services these outstanding geniuses are offering?  Just who hires and willingly pays these CEO's anyway?  It seems they are not capable of looking at society, at potential customers or the result of depriving HUMANS of jobs in the long term.  Certainly there is a large profit potential of decreasing the number of workers and HUMANS do create problems but COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND AI DO NOT BUY ANYTHING!!!
  So whoever reads this, if you know some way to make a request directly to whoever is in charge of obtaining videos on prime; please forward this in it's entirety to them, thank you!",1534464000,,2393,4.440366972477064

8762598,5,B01G93HKW2,My Fair Lady is just delightful.  It was shot in 70mm and this restoration is one of the best I've ever seen.  The color is so beautiful and rich.  Just fantastic.  The sound is also excellent.  Highly recommend.  Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison are perfectly cast!  Just a lovely film to enjoy.,1522454400,5,295,4.5576923076923075
