4985441,5,B006G0KY6S,"Gloriously laid back, unpretentious, just silly enough, I wish this show were available in the States.  It would almost be worth the price of a cable subscription.  I have a few Canadian friends and they tell me that they absolutely got the curling club down pat!  Donut shop and stale beer and nobody takes him- or herself too seriously.  What a refreshing change from US TV!  Get it; you'll love it.",1326412800,5,401,4.591549295774648
8497258,5,B006G0KY6S,"This really doesn't have much to do with the film, Men with Brooms. Paul Gross guest stars in one episode. So if you were expecting this to be a continuation, it isn't.

It is a very funny sitcom about an underrated curling team. The diverse cast is pretty funny. I know absolutely nothing about curling and was able to enjoy the humor. Its not vulgar and raunchy like so many other shows currently on TV. Its really sad that there was only lased a season. But it was extremely funny and well produced series. I really like the Doughnut shop owner and his wife. But all the cast was great.",1469836800,2,589,4.3545454545454545
8497259,5,B006G0KY6S,"A really funny, little series - just too bad it only got one season. I love the concept of curling being the axis around which the lives of the, very different, men inhabiting this lovely, ficticious town, revolve.. As a fan of the film, and (not to mention) Paul Gross, I feel this series loyally continues the whackiness of the film.",1435881600,,335,4.508196721311475
8497260,5,B006G0KY6S,Hilarious show. Wish they hadn't cancelled it.,1418515200,,46,5.714285714285714
8497261,4,B006G0KY6S,"I bought Men With Brooms because of Aliyah O'Brien. She was fantastic, and I was happy to find that the series was actually quite funny.",1407456000,,136,4.48
8497262,5,B006G0KY6S,"Whereas the dipsticks in the US seem to want to spend oodles of money to over-produce poor actors/comedy themes, the Canadians seem to gather extremely competent actors together, given them a theme to follow and let them do their job.  Very funny series, good family viewing and I'm only regretting there were not more seasons to the series.",1396224000,3,341,4.879310344827586
8497263,3,B006G0KY6S,"Enjoyable, yet the curling aspects are more references than actual game-play.  Still, IT IS BETTER than most of what passes for American television these days.",1394755200,,159,5.36
8497264,3,B006G0KY6S,"It's ok, but it's not Corner Gas. There are just too many characters not to like. Paul Gross narrates and does some cameos, but his character is obnoxious. Better than american sitcoms, but just barely.",1388448000,2,202,4.8
8497265,4,B006G0KY6S,"This series reminded me in some ways of ""Corner Gas.""  Not in the actual setting, but in the fact that the entire thing revolves around interesting and quirky characters in a locale that doesn't seem that it would lend itself to comedy.  There's really no overall continuity for the show, meaning that you don't need to watch the episodes in order to enjoy them.  The show isn't bawdy, but it isn't boring either.  There is some romance, but the show is really more about the friendships.  I spent a lot of time grinning and very little wincing, which is a rarity for comedies in this day and age.  And I was impressed that they didn't rely on lowbrow humor to get a laugh.  Not that I mind that kind of humor as a rule, but it can get tiring in a television series.  This is the kind of show that made me happy that I bought a region-free DVD player.  Oh, and Aliyah O'brien . . . damn!",1388361600,,887,4.232142857142857
8497266,5,B006G0KY6S,"I waited for so long for this to be offered in the U.S.! What an enjoyable show. Based around a curling rink, yet not all that much curling happens...but love it!  It shows part of the life of a querky curling rink, and offers the watcher its comedic insights. I really wish this would have been extended at least 1 if not 2 more seasons. Enjoyable to sit and 'veg-out', while giving my inner caveman, Carl, some comedic curling 'meat' to chew on. RAWR!",1355270400,,453,4.392857142857143
8497267,5,B006G0KY6S,It's hard to believe they are cancelling this show!  Great characters and fun story lines make this one of the best shows on last season.  Don't worry if you don't know anything about curling.  It's not relevant to the enjoyment of the show.,1328745600,,241,4.558139534883721
