8150383,5,B000JHGDKK,"Bernard is an amazing timekeeper, groove master, innovator of supertight explosive funk drumming and more. Purdie can probably get a statue dancing with his freight train groove. I'm not saying this is this is the best drum learning video but it is one of the best and should definitely be viewed by anybody who wants insight toward the value, power, and possibilities connected with a drumset. Bernard Purdie has made a significant contribution over the years to the art of drumming and that is clearly evident throughout this video.",1330905600,,534,5.01123595505618
