The DVD itself is poorly produced, there is a chapters selection but it don't give chapter titles or anything like they are seperated into in the movie, only pictures that are pretty much useless unless you've memorized the movie inside out.
The wrestling on the DVD is ok. Some of it is very talented wrestling and some of it, like most backyard wrestling is extremely sloppy and hard to watch.
The DVD also includes a few Whole matches or almost whole matches and these are boring and have no psycology to them at all. If you are a real wrestling fan, don't bother. This isn't for you, or if you re just a fan of backyard wrestling in general this still prolly isn't what you are looking for cvause it is very lackluster.
If you want something better and more like a real movie, check out ""The Backyard"".... it is like the Backyard ""Beyond the Mat"" and it is MUCH better then this.",1089849600,,940,4.346590909090909
8515095,5,B0001CNQ0I,This is a great DVD if you love pro wrestling or if you love backyard wrestling.  The wrestlers will also say a lot of great things about Backyard Wrestling that you wouldn't expect to hear.,1087776000,,190,4.428571428571429
8515096,4,B0001CNQ0I,"Ever see a backyard wrestler do a perfect Shooting Star Press or 450 splash?  Wanna see high intense, clean, crisp execution of wrestling moves?  Then I highly recommend this DVD.  This video is NOTHING like the Best of BYW videos.  I do not work for these guys so this is not made up.  I love BYW and some of the moves some of these kids pull of is amazing.  Plus pro-wrestlers share their thoughts on BYW.  DVD has music videos, full matches and interviews.",1079395200,2,459,4.392857142857143
