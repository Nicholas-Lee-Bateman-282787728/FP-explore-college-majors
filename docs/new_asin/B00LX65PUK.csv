8668697,1,B00LX65PUK,"Hello, fellow anime fans. Yes, you probably have been looking for the Fate/Zero blu-ray at an affordable price for a long time. I know that feeling.  Screw Aniplex of America.

I bought this release from ebay, where the listing falsely claimed that it was a Region A release. This blu-ray release is the release from Madman Entertainment, an Australian distributor. You can see this on the back of the case, which is shown in the preview images above. While you're there, check the bottom right section of the case's back, and notice the Region B symbol, right under the blu-ray disc logo. That symbol means that you can only play these discs in blu-ray players from Europe, Africa, and Australia. When you pop one of these discs into your American blu ray player, your player will display a picture of Caster's hand grasping his Grimoire, with a giant Region B symbol overlaid on top of the image. It will say something like ""this disc players in Region B only"". You will be locked out of the disc, not able to watch any of it.

So if you are desperate to beat the system and not support Aniplex of America (like me), you can buy this release, buy a cheap Region B blu ray player, and buy an outlet plug adapter so that your blu-ray player can use US outlets. This release will work in that blu ray player, and it will cost significantly less than if you bought Aniplex of America's overpriced release.

I am giving this product 1 star because its item description is false. This is not a Region A blu ray.",1468972800,19,1507,4.489051094890511
